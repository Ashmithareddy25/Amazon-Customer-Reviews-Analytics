B007SYWFRM|5.0|My four year old daughter LOVES this game!!! Especially the babies! I love that it so closely resembles the movie. Excellent job!!!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I appreciate that the author tied up loose ends as this is the last in this series. And I've always been on Team Sam.  I also appreciate that she actually finished out the story arc as so many others just leave you hanging or keep going long after its run its course. It seems that the fashion these days is keep on going long after the story line has become tired.  The end of a good run is always bittersweet when you will miss the characters, but I like knowing they are in a good place. Ms. Harris has always entertained me with her stories and characters and I look forward to see what's next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great game.  The cities are awesome and I love doing the missions.  You can play it everywhere.
B00A7W29BE|2.0|I cannot get it to work at all on the kindle.  Perhaps it's just me but their seem to be no instructions
B008M721MS|4.0|This is a great app to have especially if you're on the go. You can keep in contact with others even if your not close to a phone. It is not hard to manage, but you have to pay extra if you want to talk to more than 1 person at a time. It's a good deal for a good price!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Ever since Downton Abbey, I have become obsessed with British soap operas and upstairs downstairs is good. Sometimes it was hard to keep my attention and it's way more dramatic than Downton abbey but at the end I found myself wanting to continue watching.
B00199B2Z8|3.0|This is not A Walk in the Woods or Notes From a Small Island.  Some chapters have his trademark sunny but sarcastic tone, but others just fall flat.  I never really finished reading the entire thing.  However, the chapter on the Post Office and Refrigerators were great.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Now this was a movie I did not see coming, it blew me away, what a spectacular movie, an inspriation for any of us who felt 'not popular' in school!  Absolutely loved it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I ordered the box set for 20 dollars and the print was so small I couldn't read it.  So I brought the Kindle version and love it.  I must say that the movie follows the book.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Its ok but you don't need it on your kindle. Your kindle tells you how much battery you have in your settings under device. Also I'm pretty sure it doesn't really know your kindles temperature, but its nice to know how long your kindle has before you need to plug it in. Glad its free today but would not pay 0.99&cent;.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I absolutely enjoyed the first two books and couldn't put them down. Which left me anticipating the release of this book as soon as I finished the last page of Book 2. What a waste of time, I wish there was a no star option! There was no plot, situations with various characters that were ramped up were just page fillers and never explained reasons why, the book just abruptly skipped to Eva later in the day. The transitions were not smooth, rather they were extremely jumpy. I had to read back a few paragraphs many times to make sure I didn't miss something. There were so many unfinished story lines that it left me wondering what the book was really about and what was the point of repeating Eva and Gideon's conversations over and over (we got it the first 20 times they said I love you...). It was a horrible ending which wasn't really an ending as the trilogy has been extended to 5 books. I have returned Entwined with You and this (former) Fan of You is finished with the Crossfire Series. It was a Trilogy, right? Three books, I'm done with you.<br />Hope Sylvia Day and Penguin Publishing reads these comments so they can learn from their mistakes.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|This is a ridiculous version of the Die Hard series and undoubtedly the last. It was that bad. I probably should give it one star but it did have a few spectacular action scenes. Other than those, there is nothing else to recommend this movie. It was obvious that Bruce Willis really had no interest in this movie and was doing it for the money. The story line is bad, the acting is bad, most of the action is bad, the villains are bad. This movie was made to use the success of the previous Die Hard movies and make a few bucks on as low a budget as possible. The movie is dark, I expect it was done that way so you don't see the backgrounds or something. If the movie was entertaining I could overlook a lot but this wasn't much for entertainment.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett's attention to detail is remarkable.  He is able to create distinctive world - from the mines in Wales to the trenches in Europe.  However, the time spent in Russia felt overdrawn and repetitive.  Minus the main character, very few characters in the Russia section seem humane - they are stereotypes of the typical cold-heart Soviets created during the Cold War.  However, he masterfully intertwines six different plots into a complete narrative - quiet impressive.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|As a huge Queens of the Stone Age fan, I have been waiting for this album for a long time. Sufficed to say, I was not disappointed by what they released! The album has its own unique feel to it. It's dark, it's sexy, it's fun and it's all Queens. If you're a fan of Queens of the Stone Age, please, buy this album!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Translation is in reality impossible (the italians have a saying which we may render as 'a translator is a traitor') but, if you cannot read French, this is a good start.<br /><br />The 19th century is becoming more distant to us as our technology changes (advances?). The French Revolution is one of the seminal events in world history in the last millennium. Give it a read and see what you think.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This app is very fun. It is kind of like a mixture of little big planet and super Mario. It has sort of a weird story line but its keeps your interest. Diffidently a must have app for any gamer or kid

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing. it is great to pass time by when you have nothing to do. I love this game.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a very useful app for a Kindle Fire HD, and I'm quite happy with it.  It's hard for me to read the little battery symbol and tell exactly how much charge is left, but this app makes it perfectly clear.  It also lets me know when the Kindle is fully charged, a big plus since there isn't a charge light on the Kindle HD. I'm often away from my charger, and with this app I can tell how much time I have left for what I'm doing.  If this app wasn't free, I'd have paid money for it.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|one of the most original and well performed tv show ever. I really, really dislike tv in the past few years but found the compelling characters and storyline addictive!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the characters and all their issues!! The story was fast paced and never boring.  Can't wait to read book 2
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book. Perfect ebook version. But when reading you may just need a dictionary that would help if you don't know what countenance means and other words probably used in Modern English in an age where reading was actually fundamental and mostly everyone had a some form of wit as Elizabeth and, quite evidently, the author have in the story. Also be aware of the many sentences where `of the latter` is used, because Austen does use a lengthy sentence structure. The author is referring to the last thing previously mentioned. Pride and Prejudice is a great read for those with a love of literature and language but i also recommend for anyone with an understanding of the meanings if diction, details, language, syntax, and imagery for this book will require some knowledge of the latter to avoid a bewildered experience.
B003B02O3C|4.0|Typical Grisham, very enjoyable read, but not as good as the Litigator or some others.  He is still the best in the genre.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|it good.my battery use to die pretty fast but then I got this app and it help my battery still up a lot longer
B0064W639K|5.0|One of the best Dark Knight books I have ever read. Visually stunning and (spoiler) a great origin story. Shows the detective side that is seen in \\"The man who laughs.\\" One of my favorite aspects was the trio relationship between commissioner , Dent and Batman. Shows how hard it is to remain a hero in Gotham City.

B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was very much looking forward to Hosseini's next book.  I loved his first two.  I struggled to get through 3/4 of the book and finally gave up.  The characters were so disjointed and there was not a smooth flow the the book.  I hope there is a 4th book that is more action packed like his first two.  I will continue to follow this author because I loved his first two books so much.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this right after I completed the 50 Shades series and this was some time ago. I just recently started writing reviews because I thought \\"who really cares what I think\\".  But, I feel like it is a way for authors to hear their fans ... so anyway.  I LOVED IT.  Bared to You is a wonderful book.  Some say it is ripped off of 50 Shades but seriously aren't they all Cinderella stories.  I felt that Eva was stronger than some of our other female book leads and I could relate with her while reading.  Gideon Cross ... swoon.  I guess I like strong men even the damaged ones.  I got a mental picture of him in my mind the minute Eva described him and was he hot LOL.  I enjoyed the writing and the flow of the story.  I recommend this book!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It was one of those books that was hard to put down.  I appreciated the authors explanation and own feelings as he heard about the story and began gathering facts etc.  An amazing story and I like how everyone involved were able to reunite after all those years.

B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|Here is how author Lee Child describes his creation, Jack Reacher, on his website - 6'5\\", 220-250 lbs, 50\\" chest. Here is how Lee Child describes Jack Reacher through another character in one of his latest books, \\"A Wanted Man\\": \\"He was huge, for a start. He was one of the largest men she had ever seen outside of the NFL. He was extremely tall, and extremely broad, and long armed, and long legged.\\"<br /><br />Sound like Tom Cruise? Don't be ridiculous. I've read all of the Jack Reacher novels, and Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher. For that reason I won't be seeing this movie. Now I'm not a Tom Cruise hater; I've loved him in most of his movies. But this role is ludicrous casting for him.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I had no idea what to expect and was just looking for something to occupy a couple of hours.  Initially I had no intention of watching the entire series.  I had watched the Henry VIII series years ago on PBS.  Tudors, let's just say, was a completely different interpretation of the story.  Tudors took the story and sexed it up as well as made it a visual feast for the eyes.  Handsome men,(think Henry Cavill) and elegant women abound.  Beautiful sets and scene locations keep you entertained while the level of acting and writing keep you engrossed. The great thing about access to the entire series was the ability to just progress episode by episode without having to wait as Showtime's viewers had to.  Unfortunately that access also had me staying up until 4am a couple nights enthralled to see what would happen next. I don't regret it a bit and may watch the entire series again just as one who loved a good book and was sad to get to the end.  Excellent entertainment and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the story of Henry VIII.  However I would recommend it with the caveat of don't expect it to be a historical interpretation as much as just be open the pure unadulterated entertainment value.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am so late in writing reviews, well I am actually just getting started.  I waited and waited for this book and I was not disappointed. I simply loved it. I was blown away more so than Bared to You. My God I cried for Eva. I will say no more I do not want to be a spoiler. Reflected in You is simply a wonderful book. It continued Eva and Gideon's story with twist and turns. New characters are introduced and they are a great addition.
B00BF123WG|1.0|Customer Warning!<br />Can't rate the film.  The streaming blew up after about 30 minutes. This is the second time that Amazon Digital streaming has failed. Don't purchase Amazon Digital until they can do it right!

B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is addictive. The plot twists and turns keeping you always on the edge of your seat. Not for children, but wonderful adult entertainment.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really liked this book. It is just the continuation of a dramatic story. I think I would be happy buying several more just to keep reading about all the characters in the story. Isn't that why we all watch Tv? I enjoyed this book as much as the first two.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I waited for the book. I read it in a day. I was a bit disappointed that it was short and the end left me flat. I know there are a lot of readers really put out by the book and the author. At first, I was too. Then I took the book for what it is ... the middle, the bridge that will take us through the rest of the story to its end.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon's story continues along with adding more from the supporting characters. Is it annoying? Well it could be but I feel it is like a bit of a build up to a big ending (well I hope). I think if you want to get to the end of Eva and Gideon's story you must read this book. It might not be the greatest of the series but I feel it is necessary in the continuing story. That is just my humble opinion
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is an excellent  book that encourages creative thinking. I hope others will read it and benefit from it as much as I have.

B006BDHAX0|3.0|I found the game too easy to play.  I have been use to ones that are a bit more challenging.  So, I find myself<br />getting distracted while working the game program.  It is nice and done well but as I say to simple for me. Therefor, I do not play it that often.  Newies to Mahjong games should find it quite entertaining.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Season two is even better than season one.The twists and turns will keep you looking for more.<br />The blu ray disc looks and sounds fantastic of course.<br />Nice addition to anyones collection...if kept out of reach of children of course.

B005ZUR724|3.0|I loved O&amp;C Online until the latest update. Glitches are preventing me from getting into the auction house (can't get through the door) and the road is under the grass so it looks terrible. If gameloft fixed this I'd change the reviews. I tried to tell them about this and discovered that customer service is nonexistant. Also if you want a mount they are prohibitively expensive, requiring over $100 of real money to get enough in-game gold to buy the mount. Needless to say I continue to travel on foot.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Beautifully written.  Wonderful acting.  Makes a viewer laugh and cry and live in the action.  No one should miss this show if they can help it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Essential reading for a good marriage. Would make a great gift for an engaged couple. I would definitely recommend this book!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Despite its flaws, I highly recommend this show as an entertaining and engaging diversion.  It falls in that \\"guility pleasure\\" realm of something you enjoy even though you suspect you shouldn't.  Having said that, the show is a cut above many popular television dramas.  It's artful in its own way: more Mad Men than Boston Legal.  The scripting and dialogue of this show are just good enough to let its ensemble of actors shine in their respective roles.<br /><br />Juliana Marguilies as Alicia Florrick stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast, and rightfully so, as the show centers on the stay-at-home mom who returns to practicing law after her States Attorney husband cheats on her with a hooker and lands in jail accused of criminal corruption.  Juliana/Alicia as actress and character is the heart and soul of this show.  We genuinely care about what's happening to her.  Juliana Marguilies is simply marvelous.<br /><br />Graham Phillips and Mackenzie Vega are appropriately charming as Alicia's teenage children.  Their portrayals ring true, and their path toward adulthood is frequently highlighted in the story lines. Josh Charles as the hard-nosed but charming Will Gardner, Chris Noth as Smarmy but reformed(?) Peter Florrick, Archie Panjabi as the steely and seductive Kalinda Sharma, Christine Baranski as the aloof but inwardly soft-hearted Diane, and cute-as-a-button Matt Czuchry as the relentless and overachieving Cary.<br /><br />As suggested by the contrasting adjectives applied to these characters, they each display both good and bad behaviors, and all seem on some sort of trajectory toward becoming a better, or at least different, person.  That is the essence of The Good Wife and it makes the stories less predictable than they would otherwise be.<br /><br /> Alan Cummings, Michael J. Fox, Carrie Preston, and many many other fine actors round out the cast in interesting ways.  Many of the supporting characters are cartoonish, but even these minor characters tend to display the same bifurcated dimension of good and evil impulses.  Again, that's a big part of what makes this show so interesting.<br /><br />This show is not high art.  Its courtroom scenes are legally ludicrous and the plot lines melodramatic, but still it works.  That's what good actors can do.  They make us care about the characters, and so we forget about the details.  We just want to see what's going to happen to them, how will they deal with failure or success, will they give in to their weaknesses or rise above them?  Watch this show for three episodes and then tell me you don't care what happens next.  You will care.  You will want to know.  You will have a great time watching the story unfold.  That's why I give it four stars.ters tend to display the same bifurcated dimension of good and evil impulses.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Before I finished reading Entwined, I was on Amazon & was completely shocked at how many bad reviews this book got. Even though I loved the book so far, being at the 1/2 way point, I got nervous to finish when I saw how many bad reviews there were. I absolutely love this series & I didn't want it to get ruined. But as I read the reviews, I was extremely disappointed how many people gave this book one star just because they were upset that Sylvia changed her mind & is extending the series. I completely understand & get frustrated myself when I love a book & have to wait to finish the series but that has NOTHING to do with the actual review of a book. The majority of the bad reviews were just complaining how this was suppose to be the last of the series or how expensive the book was. YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO REVIEW THE BOOK, NOT TRASH THE AUTHOR. Send those comments to Sylvia by email. I went on to finish Entwined & LOVED this book! Just to be clear, someone wrote on their review that this ends on a cliff hanger, it does NOT. There are issues & storylines that she set up to be finished in the following books but this ends at a great spot. This book does have a little different vibe but that's why I liked it so much. The 1st two books centered mainly on Eva & Gideon's intense relationship but in Entwined you get to find out a lot more about the other people that are close to this couple. I really enjoyed that. I've loved Cary from the beginning & after reading Entwined, I really love Mark & Steven. In this book, you still get the fabulous, intense,& sexual relationship between Eva & Gideon but you also get to see them on a more normal & day to day level. I think Sylvia did this book justice & I really hope people don't get swayed by all the bad reviews on here because if you are really a fan of Eva & Gideon, this book hit the spot that we've been waiting to read. If you put aside your feelings about waiting for their story to finish with 2 more books, I think anyone would love this book as well. Even though it's hard to wait for the next books, (which maybe Sylvia can release the electronic version right away instead of waiting for paperback to be ready at the same time which is why she said Entwined was pushed back so far) personally I think it's necessary for Eva & Gideon's story to take longer to conclude. Just think, these 2 have such a tough & emotional past that it wouldn't make sense that they got through it all & lived happily ever after in the same amount of time that normal couples we read about do. If Sylvia tried to conclude their story in this last book, it'd feel rushed, we wouldn't get to go through all of their issues they have to conquer. There are so many things yet that they need to find out & work through that if it ended with book 3, Sylvia would have to gloss over them & than we would be left at the end saying how did they go from having so many issues to everything being happily ever after so quickly? Yes, it's hard to wait but I'd rather wait & get to read so much more about Eva & Gideon & how these 2 are able to get through it all & find peace. So buy Entwined, it's hot, sexy, funny, & emotional. It's not a disappointment at all. I am excited to read the rest of their story & find out so much more about them & how they get through it all.<br /><br />Sylvia, this is one of my favorite series, Eva & Gideon are so different but amazing together. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed reading Entwined, it exceeded my expectations. I think you made the best decision extending the series. I would have hated to have the rest of their story crammed into this 3rd book. There is just too much we need to find out & go through yet. I'm so glad you are taking your time to go through it all instead of just all of the sudden turning everything around & having everything ok now. That's not what these people are about & why it's such a great story. I thoroughly enjoy going on this journey with Eva & Gideon & am excited to read howyou continue to play out their past & future. Thank-you for sharing this amazing story!

Now to those that gave this book bad reviews shame on you making me doubt on reading it. I am happy that my best friend had already started reading it and told me it is good. Of course I was going to read it no matter what the reviewers wrote. So happy with the book and can't wait for the fourth. Thank you Sylvia Day

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book with my 4th graders as a read aloud this year.  Never have I read a novel with my students that reeled them in, kept their attention, and made them better people, as this book did. It truly touches on character education and how you can strive to be the best person you can be by doing one simple thing... being kind. This book is a touching, touching story, and I have fallen in love with Auggie... what an amazing character. To know someone like him in real life would be truly amazing. Touché' R.J. Palacio for writing a book that truly touches and effects children - which these days, is hard to do. :]

B00BVYLBP2|5.0|First let me just say that I'm a sci-fi & fantasy genre nut, so my review may be a bit bias because this is exactly the kind of series I tend go for and it's from BBC America, my favorite channel.<br />It's got action, excellent acting by the lead Tatiana Maslany and Maria Doyle Kennedy, (the others' performances could be stronger), an interesting premise, and honest to goodness mystery; there were twists even I didn't see coming.<br />My one and only complaint is that it's a bit slow to start and throws a lot of characters at you at once.<br />Just trust me when I say stick with it by episode 3 you'll be up all night because you'll be itching to see the rest! (I know I lost some sleep to this series, lol).<br /><br />Hope that helps some of you.<br />Best Wishes, JB pop-Eggs
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Yes it had some kinks and needed to find it's ground, but overall it was a great show. I can watch it over and over.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|We always enjoy the Die Hard Movies!  We love action with a little drama.  While I have heard people say it was not as well made as the other Die Hard Movies, I would disagree!  I love movies, but there are very few that I want to see again.  I will definitely see this one again!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Although my work world (unlike the author's )is actually more female than male dominated, the simple principles she suggests are great in any vocation. Worth reading!
B00333NCTM|5.0|....and its all true. It's like Ozzy telling his life story to you while sitting on a bar Stool. Hilarious and horrifying at the same time.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|My 5 year old and I went to see the movie and really enjoyed it. This game is great for us to play together. The graphics are really nice as well. The game is very enjoyable and easy to navigate and play.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|I was disapointed with all aspects of the movie, especially the lighting, while it may be trendy, I didn't like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have Pc and this version and am quite obbsessed with minecraft. it has a lot of the mobs and blocks from Pc version but I wish the updates for kindle would come out faster. all my friends have the update already :(
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love the busy action of this game and I simply cannot put it down. I will be playing this game for a long time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was great, it was a great bridge from the other 2 books, and I simply can not wait for the other 2 to be wrote and to come out! For all those who are complaining that the triology was ended terrible you should brush up on your facts on this series. It's due another 2 books, so of course she had to stop it somewhere to continue you on with their story!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent read!  I enjoyed the story very much!  Could not put it down!  Can not wait for her next book to come out!
B00AG297GK|3.0|Some scenes deserve a 5 and others a 1. The beginning and the end are very good. This movie is not as good as Borat.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME! I can play my favorite game everywhere I go! I guarantee you that  you will love this app as much as I love it!
B000V86OKG|5.0|This guy is great! I was crazy about this series when someone first told me about it. I'm so glad it's lived up to the expectation; at least the first two seasons were freakin' awesome.<br /><br />If you like blood and a somewhat funny internal struggle against ones nature, this is going to be a series for you.
B005UG542S|5.0|This movie was very well done, took the important points from the book and stayed on focus.  This is a good ending to a long series, the growth of friendships and evolvement of young personalities who must make hard choices in a world of chaos.. um, sounds like the muggle world, eh?
B00632HWOG|5.0|Allows me to pull up my emails where ever Wifi is available.  Nice to be able to view larger print on the Kindle Fire vs the Iphone
B005ZCXPP0|2.0|Not that great.  I love the Iron Man movies and the Avenger movies, but this one is just blah.  Predictable in an annoying way with no sarcastic dialogue for the adults in the audience like they have in Iron Man.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Reminds me of Quell Reflect, but more cartoony. And I mean that in a good way. Love when they bob in unison back and forth.
B0055S348W|3.0|Most of the items I may want to print are not available to PrinterShare Mobile Print. Charter email cannot be printed. I can print photos though. For the price of this app, I would expect it tp be more Apple-like. Of limited use and the interface is a bit on the clunky side.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It kept my interest from the first episode to the last. I feel that I know the members of the group and hope no more die (but I know they will)
B007T99ENE|5.0|In the beginning of the book the characters are introduced and the plot starts to unfold itself.<br />The main character is a woman who has a secret affair with a lecturer when she is a student, and he introduces her to the secret service, where she finds employment. The project she works for is called Sweet Tooth. She gets romantically involved with a young author, who she meets through her work. The story unfolds itself , and seems to trot along to a predictable ending. Just when the reader starts to think: &#34;come on, Ian, can't you do better than this&#34; the book ends in a very surprising way.  An excellent story and the language is fantastic!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is my second time reading it.  You get so much more out of the book than the movie.  I did like the movie too.
B00637HXNG|4.0|I was lucky enough to see the Scorpions live on there last U.S. tour in 2012, so you can imagine that this Blu-ray is good but will never live up to a live concert. The Blu-ray is just as good in 2D and the 3D, as a matter of fact I find the 3D distracting. The sound is great, I listened to it with high quality headphones. It has all the favorites, but is missing most of my favorites. I still recommend it for Scorpion fans and even none fans that could become fans after watching this Blu-ray.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|amazing, absolutely amazing i went from completely full storage to less than 50% in less than a minute download this app, this somehow fit in my full storage so it doesn't  matter if your storage if full or just needs cleaning
B00BF123WG|3.0|I don't know what I was expcting. Maybe my eyes aren't as good as they used to be, maybe the darkness was the way it should be. You can cover a lot in the dark and I have a feeling that what I was missing in the movie wasn't even there. Oh well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I always play on it is the best game I have ever loaded and the characters are so awesome like spike
B00A6VAW9W|4.0|These three have great harmony. I am not a big country music fan, but there are a few songs on this CD that have that folksy sound and a few that have the ol' Kenny Loggins sound. All three harmonize very nicely. It is refreshing!
B00821OX98|4.0|Fast moving story, great aliens and still a storyline. So glad it's still currently in production.  Can't wait to watch season 2.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Well, I can see why Pat was messed up, his parents were neurotic. I just could not get into the characters, the movie didn't give me enough character development to care about the them.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|The app is far short of the website.  In addition, it is a real pain in the arse to have the Kindle interrupt my web reading on the website to tell me there is an app.  Please remove that interruption.
B003FFUEO4|2.0|The movie is fantastic don't get me wrong but it came formatted for a different country and my dvd player will not play it (USA). My laptop will play it (MAC) but it says it will only play it 6 times! So now I am down to 5 more time I can watch the DVD before it is useless to me...terrible.
B000001G53|5.0|According to some, this triumph should have been thrice impossible.<br /><br />Who would have thought that Wagner would so successfully tinker with the yarns of the Old Firm, much to the disgust of his buddy Freddy Nietzsche who unleashed Greek Fire in response? The assimilation is so acute as to be scary. Wagner becomes the Fifth Evangelist in his exposition of damnation, redemption and transfiguration. For the duration of the opera, who can resist such kerygma?<br /><br />Who would have thought that Herbert von Karajan, Mr Slick Brilliance in the eyes of some, would venture so far into the realm of the spiritual? In actual fact, the question is a furphy. His Bruckner was passport. In his quest, Herbie is assisted no end by the Berlin Philharmonic, still at the peak of its powers. The Transfiguration Scene, cavernous as it is, is one of the wonders of the world.<br /><br />And who would have thought that at the dawn of the digital age, the DG engineers would so nail this recording, made in the dreaded acoustic of the Philharmonie? It has never been remastered since 1980; one can understand Deutsche Grammphon's reluctance to do so. Why bother?<br /><br />The performance is anchored by the magisterial Gurnemanz of Kurt Moll - I love the gruffness he brings to proceedings  - and Jose van Dam's Amfortas which is the very definition of anguish.  Dunja Vejzovic might be an acquired taste for some but one could argue that hysteria is inherent to Kundry as a character. No-one is going to pretend that Hofmann is the greatest singer in the world; here, he does not fail: the wobble is minimised. His lack of projection notwithstanding, he does convey Parsifal's \\"bug-eyed wonder\\". Siegmund Niemsgern as Klingsor brings Dennis Hopper to mind: more crazy than evil. He sings well.<br /><br />I suspect that the greatest Parsifal in existence is the Kna from 1951. If sonics rule that inadmissable, this performance will see you out.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas album for the last 3 years. I am not Mariah's biggest fan but she has a beautiful voice and the songs on this CD make me feel really happy, or very moved, hearing them. Her mother, who is an opera singer, is on one of the songs and it's beautiful. don't think there is one song that I don't like on this album. If you like Christmas music, and her voice, you won't be disappointed.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|Paper Monsters is a fun platformer that harkens back to the old days where there are hidden items that you need to find and multiple paths to explore. Its simple, but very fun, easily recommendable.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|The idea for this movie was great, but I'm not sure the final product was the best it could be.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have Minecraft on my Droid and it is amazing!!!! If you do..... you should get Pocketinveditor..... don't tell me I never did anything for you!!! :)
B0017QSZW6|5.0|lots of great acting, adventure, intrigue, suspense, sexy&#62; i would highly recommend to anyone who wants to watch how the english used to live and fight.
0307277887|1.0|This might have been the worst novel I've read in a long time.  I think Lindsay failed to create a reliable narrator/main character, or one that you can even give a flip about by the second chapter.  I can see why he chose to employ a first person perspective, but maybe it would have been better if it was third-person limited.  Dexter's stale commentary makes me want to smash something fragile.<br /><br />Dexter is identified as a sociopathic killer with one truly remarkable trait:  he only kills truly evil people.  This sounds like a great plot, so how on earth could someone botch a story so badly?  Lindsay writes with less depth than a Cheetos commercial.  His characters look like one-dimensional stickers that he moves from one part of the book to another with repetitive descriptions that usually focus on a single aspect of the person that was only interesting the first time it came up.  It's almost like the author thinks he's writing for an audience with memory problems... Readers do not want to be introduced to the same character in the same way each time he or she enters the story.  A reader can't connect with any of these people. People like to read about other people, so the more believable and interesting characters that can be devised, the better.  Epic fail!<br /><br />What's worse, this was the beginning of a series of books.  I have lost faith in society for good.  Many reviewers note that the TV series is much better.  Not interested, no thanks!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoy playing mostly all of the mystery object games so far I have played 2 and enjoyed them both and will continue playing them.
B0036MDNN0|5.0|in case you did not know, this figure is based on the pachyrhinosaurus from Disneys Dinosaur, and it evean matchs the color of the ones from that movie.  The design of the creture in that movie was helped created by David Krentz,  a man who knows his dinosaurs. The dino in the film was farily acurate and so is this model as a result. It would certainly make a good teaching aid when it comes to teaching about dinosaurs,on top of that its crafted with Papos signature attention to detail.
B00821OX98|5.0|this series is exciting and never has a dull moment and is very well done with the special effects. good job!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is great because it tells me everything i need to know about my kindle's battery. Overall great app that tells you everything you need to know
B000OJFV4C|5.0|lots of great acting, adventure, intrigue, suspense, sexy&#62; i would highly recommend to anyone who wants to watch how the english used to live and fight.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game very much. I play it everyday, mostly to wind down. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's close to impossible to get all the pieces.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so great they just had an update and you can spawn animals. I would give this game1000 stars if I could
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Oh my gosh!! Doesn't this app look a lot like PewDiePie's Brofist. Lol. I haven't tried this app, but when I saw that it looked like PewDiePie's Brofist, I had to check it out. By the way, PewDiePie is a YouTuber.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but this is an amazing story written so uniquely well.  I've never read a book and laughed from beginning to end all while riding the roller coaster of a romance novel.  Five glowing shooting stars.  This goes straight  to my favorites I'll be reading this again and again for sure. Do yourself a favour and buy this book.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Finely, a book that has concise instructions that are understandable, and reasonably easy to read.  Sorry, but usually when a company puts out instructions, even Amazon, they are hard to read, boring, and not very instructive.  This book words things just right for me.
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|Just a few songs that I liked. Good for those listeners who like mellow sounds. Music arrangements were just average.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sandberg's book is partly educational and partly inspirational.  She encourages women to step forward and become comfortable as leaders.  I recommend this book especially to women ages 18-35, but it is a good choice for women of any age (I'm 74)
B00407PNY2|5.0|This is as fine an example of a police/crime suspense thriller as I have ever seen.<br />Director Peter Yates's cinematic techniques are fresh, innovative, and out of the box. He mixes and melds them to a fast-paced rhythm and injects an infusion of authentic, rock-solid \\"cool\\": the person of Steve McQueen as a tough police lieutenant who unflinchingly challenges authority in order to get the job done; a really great jazz score; filming in color on location in the San Francisco of the '60s.<br />My favorite of Yates's techniques is what I call his \\"cinema verite\\" style. Mixed with the outside shots that are obviously on location are inside shots that, if they are not actually on location, SEEM as though they are. There are several hospital scenes, one in the ER, one in the OR, several on the wards, one in the morgue, where I felt that they might really have been shot in a hospital and that some of the doctors and nurses were not actors. This gives the film further energy and a feeling of immediacy.<br />Great movie!.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Our family sits down to watch with a big bowl of pop corn. It keeps you on your toes as they solve the crimes.
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|First, why doesn't these games come with an instruction on how to use them?  Second, when I finally figured out that I had to wave my new Kindle Fire all over the place to maneuver the aircraft, I said, \\"Nuts, to that!\\"  I'll have my kindle broken right out of the package.  Therefore, strike fighters gets shot down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I purchased this game for my son, and I must say that it was one of the finest investments I have made on his Kindle. He's getting ready to turn 8 (don't let that fool you, he reads at a 6th or 7th grade level), and he had an absolute blast with this game, as did I the few times he needed help. It really reminds me a lot of the old PC game Myst, though considerably shorter (looking forward to the next chapter in this series), and I really can't recommend it enough for any age group. Kudos to Fireproof for producing an exemplary gaming experience on this platform.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|There was only one song that sounded like the original Justin Timberlake. Mirror was the best song on the album. The rest were just average.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Terrific acting, especially the oldest son. I knew the story ahead of watching, but still very emotional and rewarding. Recommended.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Very happy with android. Life is getting easier all the time. Amazon products are available for services i want and quick to download. Glad I added this app
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so irritated that I am writing my first review. This was supposed to be a trilogy!! I cannot believe they left the devoted Crossfire readers hanging like this. I will NOT be buying the next book. I hope the author and her publishers are happy with all the readers they have angered.
B0026QC0YU|2.0|I used to enjoy the Mission: Impossible type &#34;gee whiz&#34;, but I no longer think such goings-on make good entertainment.  I'll take a good, done-to-earth story any day.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Enjoy the story line and action.  I always wished they would have more episodes that included exploring the city and more episodes flying in space to diferent worlds.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A good book, with a &#34;feel good&#34; message.  The movie was actually a bit better, but the book had things in it that made it a great read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show. Good actors and actresses, humor, and drama.  What more can you ask for!  Give it a try!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I cannot believe all the drama in this book. Can't wait for the next. At I hope there is a next one
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is not an enjoyable book. It is filled with violence and inhumanity. Owing to Shin's horrific past, we can never know the truth, only his truth.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like the way this game is designed with progressive upgrades to meet the challenging levels of play.  And so many items to upgrade.  A delightful concept and I'm having loads of fun.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|thank for it, i like it but wanted more, not bed, so i am glad to get it. thank you
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love the show.  Unfortunately, the download process took so long it was not worth trying to watch it.  It would download a few minutes or seconds of the show, then stop for a few minutes and then start back up.  Made viewing frustrating, so I cancelled my order and will just have to be patient for the discs to come out in August.
B0091XI3YM|5.0|We love this movie and it is even better in high def which is why we bought it.  We had only saw it on VHS before.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Have always loved Rod Stewart songs and this CD is WONDERFUL. Will probably order another one for friends, maybe soon
B00AAAKH80|5.0|you can listen to the whole cd over and over and never get tired of it. Great Job Flordia Georgia Line!!!
B00BMR5HOO|1.0|This app never could find my location (large city) so worthless to me.  I have enough weather sources as it is.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I enjoyed watching this with my g/f. I've sat through worse movies, this one was watchable enough with enough laughs
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed this authors style of writing<br />Loved the characters and how you could visualize there thoughts<br />Now reading the other two
0865479186|5.0|I bought this book a couple of years ago but just got around to reading it. Glad that I finally picked it up. The author takes the media, big business, and stupid people in general to task. He goes after everyone from make-up companies to popular education methods to those who ignoring AIDS evidence with dire consequences.<br /><br />For the most part its entertaining, and you will definitely learn a lot. I already knew that I didn't like homeopathic medicine and that there are serious problems with the nutrition advice today, but this book will help show you why. Better yet, he also gives you the tools to evaluate things yourself.<br /><br />A few things I learned:<br /><br />* I had never heard of Brain Gym, but it sounds ridiculous.<br />* Learned a lot about the placebo effect (for instance, two placebo pills works better than one . . .)<br />* Statistics are very misleading, which we all know. Goldacre shows you exactly how they are manipulated.<br />* MMR vaccine hoax is dissected. I already knew it was false, he shows you how it happened and why.<br />* The nonsense du jour chapter will point out four key errors that people make when evaluating health claims. Very helpful. He uses antioxidants as an example and makes a case for why they are not as good as everyone assumes they are.<br /><br />This is an eye-opening read and well worth your time. One of my favorite books that has changed the way I think about advertising, food, and what is healthy is [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health]]. This is close behind it, and gives an introduction to many different topics.<br /><br />One point about some of the negative reviews complaining about ad hominem attacks - in a book of this size and scope, the only way to write it is to single out individuals. Clearly Goldacre could not take on the entire nutrition industry in the space of a chapter (or a book for that matter) but he can take on a single nutritionist and use that as an example and a tool that others can use to evaluate for themselves.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.nutritionist and use that as an example and a tool that others can use to evaluate for themselves.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a wonderfully refreshing book! LOVED that it was from his point of view most of time. The first page really sucked me in because I had to find out what happened. I was truly laughing out loud & my kids probably thought I was crazy. I am eagerly waiting for the second book! Thanks so much for writing such an enjoyable book!!!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|great game it like a mobile c.o.d and the multiplayer is fun too use perk unlock guns just like c.o.d highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|The show continues to give even in it's fifth season!! Can't get enough of it! David Duchovny is a brilliant actor and perfect in this role!
B006G2124E|5.0|I watched this movie for about the 40th time tonight, and i was really thinking about it. i am from Australia and the treatment of our aboriginals is pretty dismal. But I was trying to imagine living in such fear, fear of the violence that happened to these black people simply for their skin colour. I was imagining going to bed at night, not to sleep peacefully, but in fear that you would be attacked. What a horrible way to live. This is such an important movie. And apart from the message, it is such an entertaining, fantastic movie. Love it.
0440237688|4.0|I read this paperback version (teeny tiny print, by the way, bring your glasses!) to my 8 and 10 year old children.  I like to read books like this, books that really rely on the reader to give it some life. They can read the words, but to really understand the text, chapter by chapter, really needs an adult pushing it along.<br /><br />So we began with \\"The Giver\\".  We had just finished \\"Wonder\\" and were blown away with the message of the book, and Amazon had suggested this as something we might like.<br /><br />You can tell from the other reviews what the book is about: an alternate place in time where people do not have pain, grief, or see colors, for that matter, where people are controlled by a select group of leaders.  More to it than that, but that is the general gist.  So there is this \\"Giver\\" character which is supposed to be someone who is chosen to keep all the memories, all the good, the bad, and if he/she is around and doing that, all the others can basically rest easy and enjoy their easy life.<br /><br />About 75% of the book is very positive, families talking to one another every night at the dinner table, telling about their feelings, basically never able to go to bed angry.  Very grown up stuff.  But then this 12 year old boy is chosen to be the next \\"Giver\\" as the older one is \\"retiring\\" (we find out later that isn't really the case) and he is now needing to be trained to take over.<br /><br />My issue with this book and my reading it to my kids is at the point where there is some out and out violence, death in fact, and it is dealt with so matter-of-factly.  It really struck my kids and shocked them, to the point where they were looking at me wondering if what I was saying was true!  And I simply think that the writing was implausible, no matter how fiction this book was, that they would be killing each other this deep into the book and that it wouldn't have come up earlier.<br /><br />So I am taking off one star.  I didn't think it went with therest of the story line.  I think she could have come up with a better explanation to this section of the story.<br /><br />Otherwise a well written book, and might be better for the 12+ crowd.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It's a good story gone bad with too many twists. Additionally I found that I disliked both main characters which led me not to care how the story turned out.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I cannot give you an honest answer or rating as I haven't had the time to really get into using it yet
0061950726|5.0|The Orphan Train: A Novel.....so interesting, it is a good story, kept my attention, has a good ending.  Couldn't put it down and when I did I couldn't wait to get back to reading it again.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Downloaded this gem in one swipe, devoured it in a half one.<br />Man, UR good.<br />A bit crazy, but that is a prerequisite for being halfway interesting anyway.<br />You have, you do, and you will change my life - too many insane snippets and musings to pass over unnoticed.<br />Keep at it.<br />Gotta run - do my practice !<br />p.s.: let me know when you have 20 minutes at Bucks to kill - together could be more fun.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|The movie is fantastic, being a fan of this franchise I am extremely pleased by the outcome of the finished product and hope to see more animated films based on this storyline in the main future.

B00CWVGBEO|3.0|The coast and national guard have rifles to shoot at engines to stop boats and cars. They are meant tobe helicopter mounted. But you wouldn't have a movie then.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Fans of the original show and its many seasons as well as newcomers to the Collins clan will be equally disappointed.  There was nothing particularly terrible about the movie, but absolutely nothing commendable either.  Bland dialogue, scant plot elements that barely hold the scenes together and a crippling lack of memorability left me wondering how a movie with such a great cast (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Elementary's Johnny Lee Miller, etc. . . ) could still manage to be utterly without charm.  The film manages to look stylized, like most Tim Burton projects, but it also lacked the truly unique and over-the-top artistic flourishes of Beetlejuice or Edward Scissorhands.  I would compare this movie to the Addams Family sequels in terms of quality and style, but it didn't even live up to the sentimental charm of the first Addams Family movie and maintained the made-for-TV quality predominantly due to the mediocre plot and dialogue.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|This was recommended to me by my dad, who has tried several other hearing aid products. This one was the best for clarity of voices. I bought one for my father-in-law, who was skeptical at first, but once he tried it, he was thrilled. He was looking forward to being able to talk to his kids on the phone again (by putting them on speaker phone).
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|We could not get the free game to work it only stayed on first part. Might like it if we could play it.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I've been playing this game for awhile and I have one MAJOR complaint, any time I try to move any of my habitats or buildings the controls suck! Either it doesn't move at all, moves too much or the screen jumps to some random place that isn't even my territory yet! Sometimes it even just turns blue like it's in the damn sky!  I don't understand why it does this and it truly needs to be fixed it or would be a 5 star game. Loses two stars for me because of the aggravation from this issue!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game to play on my Kindle Fire! You do need WIFI to keep up with your facebook postings, but you can play the game and it holds your scores. When you connect to the WIFI it updates and gives you more points. I play the game when I am away from my computer. It works great no skips no download issues.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This is the first such review I have written and hopefully the last. Though Miss Harris is a poor writer, having ripped off many of her characters and plot lines from her more talented predecessors, I found the series struck a fond chord with me.  I found myself loving Sookie's simple nature and penchant for country hospitality.  I found myself loving Eric, like many of the series' fans.  He was strong, dominant, commanding.<br /><br />It is to this point that I will base my review because it's obvious that CH gave up putting any effort into this series after book 5.  Just as it is also obvious that this book, at 172 pages, is a deplorable example of a novel, much less a finale.<br /><br />Now, forgive me if I sound like a disgruntled fan, but I have been perplexed since I heard CH's demeaning comments about her own creation.  Unlike Anne Rice who has been in love with Lestat from the beginning (and probably always will be), it is almost as if CH modeled Eric after someone she loved and (somewhere around book 6) started to despise.  That is the only explanation I can fathom for why a writer would leave such a striking plot hole in her series.  Why introduce Eric, write-in the fact that his heart's desire is Sookie Stackhouse and then turn him into a glorified sex slave with a lack of self control and no more care for Sookie than for a favorite goldfish?<br /><br />While you certainly don't owe anyone anything as an author, don't lie to your public.  Your little written dedication to us as fans is as much a slap in the face as it is a bold faced lie.  I am nearly certain this is not how you intended to end this series.  I think that, for some odd reason, you despised your own creations so much in the end, you saw fit to punish all those who had the gall to care about them.  And again, while you owe us nothing, while you are no artist in the true sense of the word, you should have some integrity and some pride in your work, pride enough to see it through.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Engaging reading. The story keeps unfolding brilliantly. Will Robbie becomes the hunted man. There are plenty of clues about this. Will Robbie, however, has no clue who is after him.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It's good to be able to see at a glance how much battery I have left.  This is a handy app.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this app. No more having to wonder how much time I have left to read or watch a video!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|absolutely no reason for this book. it was pointless and i am so disappointed. this series was my favorite and i was so excited to read this book. now i just feel like i wasted time reading it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is hours of fun for young and older fans of the show, I play it all the time
B00785P2QC|5.0|I enjoy playing this game because the energy bar is much larger than any other and is similar to sims city
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Fascinating reading about a little known segment of North Korea which I first found hard to believe until i recently saw an interview with someone who had escaped that environment.
B004V6SME0|5.0|Every song on here is good. Light, but not too light. Poppy, but not silly. Witty but not overly dramatic. Perfect in many ways.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I do not know what to say but READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!<br /> It is amazing and interesting and I could not put it down!!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I was recommended to read this book as I reenter into the work force and I am so happy I did.  I appreciated how the book was written as far as target areas. I am married without kids.  The chapters on kids did not relate to me but I could appreciate the additional struggles mothers go through.  This is a MUST READ if you want to get to the CEO or COO level or at least close to it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was a little apprehensive when I saw the negative reviews but I'm glad I continued on with the series.  It was great to see Eva & Gideon grow together and learn to trust each other.  I liked the mini plots within the book that I think will really pull together in the next book(s).  I noticed many of the reviews based their low rating on the fact that this wasn't the end.  Sylvia could write 4 or 10 installments and I would read them all!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I never play games on my mobile devices, but I tried this and it was terrific. A perfect balance of mind bending puzzles and spookiness.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I think this is stevie nicks at her best!! I've always loved her, I grew up with all her songs. And to hear her now older she is still GREAT!
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Cinder is a retelling of Cinderella, but other than the evil stepmother and stepsister, this story is nothing like Cinderella. It's set in a futuristic world where there're androids and cyborgs and a civilization on the moon. When humans are in a terrible accident, sometimes the only way to save them is to mechanize parts of their body and turn them into cyborgs. Cinder is a cyborg and they are considered second-class citizen. I hated how cyborgs are treated in this book. I don't know how humans can rationalize treating cyborgs as non-humans, because cyborgs are humans to begin with. Just because parts of their body are now machines doesn't mean they don't feel.<br /><br />Anyhow, Cinder is the best mechanic at New Beijing. She provides the only source of income to her family, but because she's underage, everything she earns and even she is owned by her legal guardian. So technically she has no rights. Cinder was a really likeable heroine. A lot of times she hates herself for being a cyborg, which is understandable considering how people treat cyborgs like bugs. But at the same time she stands up for herself and fight back as much as she can. She did make some stupid decisions and took some unnecessary risks, which I attribute to the fact that this is a YA book and the story wouldn't move along unless someone acts stupidly. Overall, I think Cinder is a resourceful and relatable heroine most people will like.<br /><br />I'm not feeling so much the same about Kai. I mean I liked him all right, but I think most of the book he's pretty powerless. We see a lot of the anger and hatred he has for Queen Levana, but he can't really do anything about it. Also, while some of his comments are meant to be sarcastic and funny, when put into context of where he is and who he's talking with, they do come off as childish and whiny. In addition, I don't really feel the connection between Kai and Cinder. I don't really know why Kai likes Cinder. Some chapters are told in Kai's POV, but those chapters are entirely political. Never once in those POVs do Kai think about Cinder. I'd think if Kai really loved Cinder, he'd at least think about her occasionally in his POVs. Kai was honestly kind of disappointing and very bland after reading so many raving reviews about him.<br /><br />The Lunar people are much more interesting. They are a race of humans who moved to the moon and eventually evolved after centuries to have new powers. They can brainwash people by making them see and feel however they want. I like that Meyer had a scientific explanation for it instead of just chocking it up to magic. However, I'm still kind of confused as to how the Lunar's glamour really work and how they control it. I hope most is revealed in the next book about Lunars and we see more of their power in action.<br /><br />Overall, the book has a fast pace and very interesting world-building and set-up that kept me hooked throughout. Though the story was over before I know it, on second thought not a lot of stuff happened. There were a lot of big reveals in the end, but that's only a few. It just wasn't as exciting as I'd have hoped for, especially in the romance department. However, I still really enjoyed the story and I will be reading the next book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read all three books 3 times. You can say I am a little obsessed but what can you say, they are great reads!!!!
0385342071|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Poppy is a likable and the story is lots of fun!  I have read several books by Sophie Kinsella and this is one of my favorites along with Twenties Girl and Remember Me?  It's not overly thought-provoking, but it is a light story that is fun to read.  A perfect book to bring on vacation this summer!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so disappointed in this book! It was a waste of my money and time..Sylvia Day had the perfect storyline to continue and completely dropped the ball..the book had no point..Great sex..but I need more..Book one and two were awesome but three is a failure..Doubt I'll bother with book four!
B0065GC0BA|3.0|There was no continiuty of the story some of the chapters did not cotinue on with the previous chapters.  only rate it 3
B002N44XSG|5.0|It kept me in suspense. I loved the series and I hope the diaries are just as good. Praise Rick Riordan!!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|OMG. I'm speechless. Excuse me for a second while I just sit her in stupor from the awesomeness that is this book! It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of the Psy-Changeling series by Nalini Singh, but this book is beyond even what I expected from her. If you notice, there's no mention of the hero and heroine in the synopsis and I shall not spoil it for anyone either, as I spoiled it for myself, so I shall only refer to them as hero and heroine.<br /><br />This is the twelfth book in the series. All the conflicts from the previous books come to a head in this one. There're a lot going on with the Pure Psy and the fracturing Psy society. I love the idea of the Psy and this unique race that Ms. Singh created has to be one of my favorite paranormal races. Our hero and heroine's story is deeply intertwined with the survival of the Psy race. For our hero is one capable of destroying an entire race if he had lost the person most important to him. The survival of the Psy depended on the survival of the heroine.<br /><br />To the outside, our hero is ruthless and cunning, the perfect produce of a Silent Psy. To others, his allegiance changes fluidly as he sees fit, as long as he gains power and control. However, our hero only has one allegiance and one goal - to find the girl who was callously taken away from him seven years ago. All his actions are to find this girl, our heroine. Our hero was raised by a monster, tortured and beaten. His guardian did everything to try to break him, and we can see the monster in the hero, but he's not a monster. He has a heart. He says he has no empathy, but he cannot condone the wrongs done to the innocent. Like the heroine, I wept for the little boy that our hero was and wished that someone could've saved him. Even though he says he's Silent, we see that he feels deeply, especially for the heroine. The gentle way he treats the heroine shows that he's not hopeless and is not a monster at all despite all that he suffered at the hands of his guardian.<br /><br />It takes a strong person to stand torture without breaking for seven years. When the hero found the heroine and saved her, she was a mess. Her mind was vulnerable and weak and her mind was hidden behind a labyrinth she'd created herself so that she didn't truly lose her mind and break under her torture. Despite all that she suffered, her capacity for love amazes me. Ms. Singh wrote an amazing heroine who withstood the worst that the world had thrown at her and still came out on top. I love how strong she was, and how accepting she was of the hero. I'm a sucker for second chance stories, and this is definitely the best of those as the heroine slowly remembers her past with the hero as she fell in love with the hero again in the present. Their story definitely had me in tears as I thought about all the things that could've been for our couple, instead of everything that did happen.<br /><br />I didn't want this book to ever be over. I don't know what I'm going to do with my life now that this story is over. I'm having trouble starting another book because I can't stop thinking about this one. All I can say that if you haven't started this series yet, go do so now!! Yes, not every book is going to be your favorite, but this is one of those series that stays consistent book after book, instead of having a sudden style change like many other series. And I can say the reward is worth the 1 or 2 books that may not be as great as the others!!
B00CBRAD2A|5.0|I'm NOT Keen on Schwarzenegger's Political Views but he can still deliver a blockbuster movie.  It's truly an Action Packed film that has Everything.  It is every bit as good as any movie he's ever done.  Political views aside my hats off to him on this one!!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a great story about one man's patience and ability to endure, and the deep friendship he makes along the way.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I LOVE Footloose!! Never ceases to amaze me!! Everyone should see this movie!! Music, dancing and just raging fun love it so much!!!!
0545405777|5.0|Beautiful look.....mysterious and ominous. Makes the reader excited to see what this book is about and also looks excellent on the book shelf.
B00003CXCT|5.0|had this on VHS and wanted to own it on DVD but didn't want to spend too much.  Bought used and the discs were in mint condition.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|Just a good action movie, and not a bad plot either. Die Hard still delivers a lot of action and entertains, granted those looking for a drama won't be a big fan.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|good game. good graphics. good time waster. I love it. I would tell my friends to play. very entertaining game.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a great idea, great writing and plot.  This would make a great movie instead of another super hero flick or CG fest.  So many great books out there.<br /><br />You really root for this guy even with all the disappointments that keep knocking him down.  Could see it happen in real life.
B000WN7NEQ|5.0|I love this movie so much. It always brings a smile to my face cause the dancing is hot and so Is the music
0061743526|5.0|Nice re-issue....great gift. Very nostalgic cover and size. It makes a nice gift for those who have never read this classic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic series.  I am hooked.  Cant wait to see what is next.  I am  intrigued with the style of clothes and the way the people lived in that day and especially the social hierarchy back then was so final.  No room for independence as a person. Anyways, Love this series and can't wait to see what happens next
158270208X|2.0|I was expecting a book to read with some space for annotations. This is more like a empty notebook with just some inspiring phrases in some of the pages. Not much directions in what to annotate in those spaces either. I anyway kept it as I just recently bought the book called Magic and use this to write the things from Magic here. But it was really a lot more cheaper just to buy a blank notebook for that. If I would have paid the full price fir it I would gave immediately return it. Not worth it!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|The puzzles are cute and just challenging enough. Love the pudding garble, and the way they pay attention to what you are doing with their one eye!
B008OM0EDO|4.0|This is a good satire on the despotic life of middle-eastern dictators. You can help but think of the lavish excesses of Saddam Hussein and Mummar Qaddafi when you watch this. Sasha Cohen is excellent at giving us an over-the-top view of the oil rich dictators and what the world must look like from their skewed perspective. Def worth watching.
B001AG52AG|4.0|I like the movie but I really hate the ending it was the worst cliff hanger ever, also they didn't even bother to make another one
B00AEBB97S|5.0|This is an amazing movie! It has been years since we had seen this movie. It is such a unique movie!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is a typical Tom Clancy book wiht Jack Ryan Jr. as the main subject of the book.  As such, it is one I liked reading, but I had to realize this is one book of a series of books about the Ryan's.  Still, it had good action and that is what the Clancy books about the Ryan's are about, therefore I liked it overall.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Sutter has a great story line going with characters that are well developed.  If you have not seen SoA at all start from season one and you won't be disappointed.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|This edition is great because it contains the blu-ray and DVD discs to experience it on both formats and the movie is just Great!! Unfortunately the digital copy is not available for my country so I could not have the movie in my tablet.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|very smooth controls, creative puzzle game. so far I've enjoyed this quite a bit. zeptolabs has proven themselves to be a leader in the gaming apps genre. kudos
B005WUHAX8|5.0|my granddaughter uses her case all the time. She loves taking it to the pool and taking pictures underwater. Just be careful not to loose the headphone plug.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I HAVE SPENT HOURS ON THIS GAME AND SEVERAL OTHERS. THE HIGHER YOU GO THE HARDER IT IS. Sometimes it is a challenge.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great app! totally worth the 7 dollars! You want this app if you have &quot;gaming thumbs&quot; and a creative mind!
B000HL0EEE|1.0|Complete disregard for any history already predetermined in previous series. Awful, I can see why it was canceled after 4 seasons.
B002AT4KA0|5.0|I really like The Fast and the Furious saga and I had to have this social edition of the movie!!! Totally recommended!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Another great book. Made mistake of reading his next Puller book first. Now I'm caught up. Filled in a lot of holes.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a game that I played over a couple of weeks, but only because I forced myself to put it down! There is a great mix of hidden objects and puzzles while putting clues together to solve Objectives. The objectives are basically chapters of the overall mystery story. I enjoyed the story but it was pretty corny in a few places. would have liked to see less animated story-telling and more puzzles. Definitely one of the better ones out there though. Must try!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone that has always wondered if our dogs really know what is happening in our human world!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|It was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Could not have asked for a better storyline for the main character. When I first started the book I was excited to see who it was about as I had steered clear of any spoilers and it was totally worth it. Nalini does it again. Can't wait to see what is in store for the installment.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show just keeps bringing you deeper and deeper into how humanity would act when presented with such an astounding apocalypse.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|This movie is well done and it makes you stay in your seat all the time! Unfortunately the digital copy is not available for my country so I could not have the movie in my tablet.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Its so cool to have so many books and they fit in my phone! For young people this is no big deal but for us more &#34;mature&#34; users it's great! I can have books of all kinds at my fingertips and even the page I left off on is saved. Technology is a great thing :)
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I hate that I waited so long for such an abrupt ending and a horrible cliff hanger. Probably wont read the next one.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I remember this show airing for the past couple of years and even tried to watch one episode a while back. However, I had no clue what was going on which demotivated me from watching it any further. When this series became available for Prime users I started watching it from the very beginning and instantly became hooked! This show is a MUST. The writer and all the creators of this show are impeccable!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Oh<br /> Mr DeMille, you always amaze me-! This book kept me reading all night! Another great cast of characters, great story and just enough humor to make the most hard-core reader crack a smile!  Thank you for another great read!
B009X2CRMK|4.0|Well written original story. I enjoyed this book very much although at times it was a bit difficult to distinguish between Cassandra and her grandmother. I look forward to reading more works by this author, her books have that &#34;can't put down&#34; quality.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This edition is great because it contains the blu-ray and DVD discs to experience it on both formats!! Unfortunately the digital copy is not available for my country so I could not have the movie in my tablet.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I liked the realism of this horse but got bored with it after a while. It was fun to watch it run and grooming it was too. A good app if this is as big a commitment as you can make to an animal.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I like that they are using the original stories to base the episodes on, even though it's set in contemporary London.  Great acting, I especially love the rapport between Holmes and Watson.
B001BANK32|4.0|I've enjoyed King 's novels from a much younger age and now that I'm older I see what drew me to him. Suspense, comedic punches, originality, all I find in this books. I read this so that I could have a better sense of Danny and his history as I anxiously wait for Dr. Sleep to be released.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|I feel like I suffered &#34;side effects&#34; just watching this movie.  I felt like I was given a dose of bad medicine.  Not the least bit suspenseful to me.  I couldn't wait until it was over.  This movie was a tough pill to swallow.  The producers should be hit with a malpractice suit.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|It was a good movie, good story and good history. A little long and very wordy, but Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We have seen the first two seasons; missed the TV episodes for several of the 3rd season; but completely enjoyed all three. Maggie Smith's lines are witty, sometimes &#34;biting,&#34; but always delivered with her elegant touch. I'm glad she has an appearance in each episode. We also especially liked Shirley MacLaine and look forward to her appearance again in season 4. She was delightful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downtown Abbey is set at just the time that I find fascinating.  The story line is captivating, the clothes are awesome, the acting is superb and I can't wait until the next one comes out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great! it rocks! I cannot believe it is free! the grafiks are so realistick and the horses seem real
B00AAX68HG|3.0|the game is fun but can be a little tricky. i thought i would try it since its made by zepto lab and i think free is a good price for it since it can get a little boring.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|All I can say is that I loved this movie.  It might be geared more for a female audience though.  The entire cast gave brilliant performances.  Should have gotten the Oscar.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book is like the other Dan Brown books I have read. It is hard to put down once I started reading. It is a work of fiction but it has several factual events and places worked into the writing. It is certainly a fun book to read.
B0094M4NBW|4.0|Just to watch it again I bought it. I am not sure that this movie is for everyone; The ending wasnt great, too contrived.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was a great follow up, don't get me wrong.  BUT, I thought that this was the last one in a trilogy, and I found at the end that I was wrong.  I am like so many others, I am tired of trilogies.  I want to read A book and know the whole story.  Shame on you Ms. Day.
B0016CVN02|4.0|What's not to like?  Well, the stones had so much great music in that era, there's no way they could have put it ALL on four album sides.  this could easily have been a three disc set and still been super.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey is even better than Season 1. This series is very entertaining series with a wonderful cast.
B00BF11STU|1.0|My first complaint about this movie was the performance by Jessica Chastain.  My second complaint was the weak plot.  Would not recommend.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|In fact, I think I will start using the line &#34;get off my lawn&#34; because of this movie. Lots of subplots, but dont miss the important one if youre over 50.
B008GJV8BW|5.0|I saw this movie listed for a while but wasn't too interested. Finally gave it a shot figuring I would get some work done while watching. I had to stop work and give it my full attention! Great storyline, great acting, I would watch it again!
B007Y36K46|5.0|This is a B movie.  Right at the top of the B list.  Very good special effects and good action movie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This app is a great time consumer, and fun to play. Your city rapidly grows. It is a little annoying when you run out of resources (  investment point thingy).
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I had higher expectations for this movie considering all of the hoopla surrounding it at Oscar time.  In my opinion, the movie was average and boring.  Should not have gotten the Oscar over Silver Linings Playbook.
B008OB1QFK|5.0|Gets better each listen. Chris Knight cannot really be classified and, thankfully, does not appear to worry about what the latest fad might be.
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Calling is one of the best biographies/autobiographies of first had accounts of WWII that I have ever read. Franz's description of how tough it was to be in the Luftwaffe towards the later part of the war, especially in North Africa, putting up with the arrogant high command of Air Marshal General Goering. A must read for anyone who wants to know both Allied and Axis true experience. The chapter where Franz nearly lost control of his ME 262 and the comical end had me laughing. It rates in someways better than Erich Hartman's autobiography as is Franz personal stories of life in the waning days of Nazi Germany is more revealing. I am glad that for whatever reason Franz did not meet up with the 466th BG 787th squadron, they were B-24s and although Franz showed compassion for that devastated B-17 that day, Franz also reveals in the book that B-24's were a favorite target of his due to the proclivity of the fuel lines in the bomb-bay to ignite, my father was a B-24 ball turret gunner. I disagree with a previous review giving only three stars because most of the book emphasized Ace Franz experience. It does not bother me that 3/4 of the book is spent on Franz, he was after all, the complex mystery fellow that made the book what it was in the first place, it was his dignified chivalrous valor that day that was most certainly part of a higher calling in his character. I agree with any others that believe making a movie based on this book would could be fantastic.I only wish Franz and Charlie would still be alive to watch it together, well, maybe they will from above.
B0015AARJI|5.0|About half the price of a new controller from Walmart.  Works great and had no scratches, but it didn't come with a charging cord.
030758836X|5.0|Suspenseful and clever.  Enjoyed every minute of reading it. I will certainly see the movie and I wish that I could find another book as well written as this one.  Did not want to put it down and then again I did not want it to end.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Excellent movie!  One of the best I have seen in a long time.  Natalie Portman gave a gripping performance.  Would definitely recommend for mature audiences though.
1439153663|5.0|What a great book. The story grabs you from page 1 and does not let go. I couldn't put it down and finished very quickly. Must read!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Most character pieces like this take significant time to develop and usually lag at the beginning. This one was engaging from beginning to end. Characters were all very well cast. Loved it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|What can you say, it's Facebook. Everyone needs to be able to get it anywhere's they would want. Love it
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is not a DVD, this is a world-wide experience. Everytime I watch this DVD, I realize exactly what Jesus did to save me and,as painful and hard as it is to watch, I love HIM even more. It's not for the faint of heart, it's not the traditional family movie. It is however a very essential DVD to receive as your own personal copy because it teaches you things through words and actions no other movie can teach you. I hope all who gets it appreciated all the effort taken to keeping it authentic in language, events and the message being told. Contrary to what happened to the director, this is his finest work. A masterpiece and a classic.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I really love this show. The characters are really engaging. And the story is addictive. If you like Downton Abby you'll like this.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|What more could be said about this book that has not already been said. No matter if you have read comics and want to see one of the classics or just want to know why everyone talks about it, this book is worth the read
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Fun game good way to kill time. I just wish you could find jewels instead of having to buy them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's not very challenging but it is relaxing. I've gone through all the freebies and might go ahead and purchase other packages. I like the color array.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Kind of slow in some spots but I love these books.. Why'd it have to be Peeta though (Team Gale)
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Baldacci never lets us down but keeps us reading long into the night when we should be sleeping.  You got to love it.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Characters well developed and actors great!  Always looked forward to the next episode.  Look forward to seeing how the plot was developed in sequel year.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Good show. Great casting. Very cool to have prime to watch most of the seasons. It's very different yet redundant due to the historical story. Great cinematography
1616550414|5.0|I ordered this book due to it's pre-order discount and because of how sturdy the book looked.  I figured it could hold a door open for hours uninterrupted. To my chagrin, the cover is much to slick and the tome isn't terribly heavy.  Sighing heavily, I opened the book to find it some nerd's wet-dream of a collection of Legend of Zelda related art, design prints, lore, and letters by Shigeru Miyamoto and Aonuma Eiji.<br /><br />Needless to say, I poured over the contents for hours, gaining ancient, forbidden knowledge.  Would recommend.
B009SH5JS4|1.0|I have tried this in all three of my DVD players (blue ray) and there is nothing on this disc. What a rip off!!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a great series and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I love the series The Good Wife.  I like it even better being able to watch it on my Kindle at any time of the day or night.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|A lot of fun. Easy to get hooked on for both my daughter and I. You can fly on the jot air balloon.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Works flawlessly, and I really enjoy the no time limit.  Allows me to look away without losing stars or something for it.  This developer is one to support.  Have not seen a bad app yet.
B000HL0EEE|4.0|Story plots are good. Carries out the theme of the old Star Trek series very well. I highly recommend it.
159463176X|3.0|Too much time between opportunities to read this book caused me to lose the thread at times.  I needed to go back to re read and identify characters.  That is because I lack familiarity with the given names and some customs,  I enjoyed the style and do plan to go back and read the story again.
B005FITIIC|4.0|I like this movie but I think for someone who doesn't have much interest in the markets it would be a hard sell.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Riveting, & chilling, although you could start to put it together towards the end. Can't wait to start on the next one.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Do NOT install on Kindle Fire HD!!! I thought people were over-reacting about the add-ons but it makes you not be able to see any webpages after use! Shame on Amazon for promoting it as app of the day.<br /><br />Really a shame because the app itself is amazing at guessing you character.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|The reason Hollywood keeps making garbage like this is because so many people liked it with 4 or 5 stars on here.  When will I learn to quite trusting the masses. I wish I was aloud to give it zero stars because now it looks like I thought it was worthy of a 1

B00AEBBAEU|5.0|I saw this movie 4 times in theaters and loved it. While there were many people who did not so if you are interested I would watch a trailer before buying.
B000IZA9NU|4.0|I enjoyed it from beginning to end, Had a very good plot, very good interaction between the characters. The only thing I didn't enjoy was when Data sacrificed his life. But I guess that is the only way it could work out.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|It was just okay.<br />It dragged along.<br />If you want to multi-task and have something on in the background, this is your movie. Few good moments but I read a magazine at the same time.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|soothing and inspiring.  However, I will never be bale to hit those high notes.  As an aspiring singer songwriter, I enjoy delving into his process and methods.  I believe this is the album that he spent 3 months in the woods creating.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I was first introduced t to this game by the kids I baby sit. I loved to! I bought it on my I touch and when I bought my.kindle it was one of my first games. It is so addictive.  Teenagers and adults have fun styling the hair, ask.do preschoolers, and it helps children with their motor.skills. this is a game I would recommend to anyone. :):):):):):)
B000SVZIOE|5.0|This easily became one of our favorite movies. It is clean fun for all ages and I would recommend it.

0738737909|5.0|The Tarot Illuminati by Erik Dunne, his first published tarot deck had taken the tarot community by storm and surprise. Those who followed Erik and the deck's birth on Facebook got to see a masterpiece be born online. Finally the deck has been \\"birthed\\" into the world and what a deck it is!<br /><br />This is a deck, which in views has skyrocketed to the top and has almost unanimous embrace as a masterpiece and is a deck, which can be placed on the level of Ciro Marchetti's decks. I will mention that the art style is not the same of C.M as the two styles are different the reason the tarot illuminati can be placed on such a high pedestal is due to the quality, attention to detail and eye popping color.<br /><br />Tarot Illuminati has nothing to do with the Secrete Society that bears the same name. Tarot Illuminati is about the process of illumination and enlightenment of the Self.  The central theme is of Light and the use of Light in the deck and the descriptions in the accompanying book refer back to Light concepts and references.<br /><br />Some of the decks in the first production run had damage, missing cards or other problems. Luckily my deck was not one of those so I will not be addressing any complaints by others. Buy the deck and if you get a defected one get a replacement it is simple as that.  The quality of the deck is top notch for a mass produced deck published by Lo Scarabeo. The cards are borderless with gilt edges. The cards are wider than normal Lo Scarabeo decks. The card stock is firm, not flimsily. The color reproduction is great, it stays true to what I think Erik was trying to express in his cards.  Images on a computer will always look better than a printed image, that is a fact because a computer screen projects the image with light while a printed image reflects light to our eyes, thus a difference in appears. Don't forget the reproduction on papers uses ink, not computer pixels which have a wider range. With that said the images are still stunning and eye popping, true tarot eye candy!<br /><br />The artwork is lush and luxurious, flowing with textures, elaborate customs and  over the top realness this deck stands apart from the rest. However as wonderful as this is, in some cards this can make images look a little too busy with too much for the eyes to take in. This may be due to the shrinking of the images to card size from the original larger images. The Hierophant for example has a small head and hands compared to the rest of his body. Maybe the clothing is meant to be larger and puffed out? I am not sure of the creator's intent however this is something I noticed. Despite this, which is a minor comment and the only \\"flaw\\" I can see.<br /><br />Some of my favorite cards are Temperance, Judgment, The Fool, 2 of Swords, all the aces, 10 of Cups, 8 of Swords and 9 of Pentacles.<br /><br />Overall I cannot stress enough how much I love this deck, it is a masterpiece!tunning and eye popping, true tarot eye candy!<br /><br />The artwork is lush and luxurious, flowing with textures, elaborate customs and  over the top realness this deck stands apart from the rest.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had already seen the third season.  This collection filled in the blanks.  I just love the series.  Can't wait until 4th season. By then I will be filled in with the previous activities at Downton Abbey
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Will never forget this book.  I was not expecting what read and I think that was the best part of book.  There is so many emotions that ran through this book that it is hard to describe.  It is a must read.  Please put this on your list to read.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|i feel like i got dragged along to a really bad intermission of a book. i never go out to buy a book at a store or make a review but i am so dissapointed. i love these two characters stories..but i didnt want tohave to go through the whole book and get to the last two pages to get something out of the book. i waited forever just to read about a love story that contained  two ppl confined to one room in the book getting no where, i mean really you had to have the main character hiding away the whole time! huge dissapointment!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is really awesome guns looks real authentic and the gun shots sound so real. It is definitely a must buy for people who liked the fist.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie brought tears to our eyes. The realism of the folklore-type story was great. Story better than expected. Animation the best we have ever seen. The Blu-ray showed the huge 3D depth. Colors bright. Each character had their own style. Not sure how far children would be able to accept this story with arrows flying at the black bear and then death. It might be difficult for children to cope with depending on whether or not they have learned about life and death. We plan on having Amazon send our brother a copy. It's that good.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very well written and interesting. I highly recommend this season and its better than the second adylum.jessica lange is top notch
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. I truly do. This game has so much effort  into it. My one gripe is that Amazon doesent get the latest updates like apple or android. THEY GET IT ABOUT 2-3 weeks later!!! It makes users feel left put so i hope amazon fixes that issues. I recommend getting this app!!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb racing is tons of fun! It is a very addicting game:-) my kids love playing it every single day

B003UBTX7C|5.0|one of the  best of the camel club.  really held my interest. I hope he will continue the series.  i just finished the book and I miss the characters!!!
B00004TDTO|5.0|I know it's on tv all the time and I had seen it to death.  So after several years of not seeing it at all I finally bought it and sat down to watch it as movies were made to be seen, without commercials.  What a great movie, scary, funny, dark, and more.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I really enjoyed the first book in this series. The second was good. But i found this one rather chaotic. It makes me think that this is a neverending series with each volume a little slower than the last.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|very worthwhile to pass some time. frustrates you enough, that you are determined to keep going until your brain hurts.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|When I need to handle fraction problems I know where to turn! I definitely think it will be nice when I am baking or measuring things!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Typical of Lee Child, this book starts you off in one direction then spins you around fast enough you aren't sure where you are headed until the last page. A great read.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is great! We use it to put our son to sleep every night!! and naps too, I put it on his ipod and on my phone so if we are visiting someone and he needs a nap we can use it on my phone! You can customize how it sounds and get just the mixture you like! Many choices!
B002CNK1MK|5.0|Perfect pairing with Cruise and Hoffman. The movie deserved every award it won. Hysterical, touching, and informative. Will be a classic for many decades. Definitely recommend watching if you are 16 and over.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the convenience of checking weather from my tablet.  I love that this app shows weather by the hour and by the day and the week.  Love the accurate radar.  Definitely recommend this app!!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This one kicks as* in my honest opinion . It sounds just as good , if not better , than the last few to me . But each person has their own views and opinions , and I respect that as well . I'd love to see them on this tour !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|even better than the first! a bit harder at first but a nice new challenge with interesting new features. a definite buy.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|This CD is a good easy listening CD, who doesn't like to listen to Michael's music.  It is soothing and satisfying.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|The app works well with my device it just doesn't have a usage graph and that's my only complaint  with it
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Not really a game player but this one is great game to pass time and can be addictive. Good for beginners like me that are looking for uncomplicated games
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I FOUND THIS VERY INTERESTING AND LOVE THE GRAPHICS IS TO FOLLOW I would recommend this game for yourself and your kids!! Family friendly and fun for all!!
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Justin could have played it safe by reprising his last CD but has chosen to continue to push the envelope of R&B/Dance music to new heights yet always being true to &#34;his sound!&#34; Repeated listenings will reward with new found depth to his writing and performing abilities. Definitely worth a listen!
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I show this the last week of school for high school juniors and seniors.  Not only do I love it, they do as well.  It's a great look at how various cultures interact with and raise their children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm like addicted. It is a lot of fun to play and build your own world. Everyone should pay it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is a definite must have download for your kindle fire hd!  Now I know when my kindle is about to shut off, giving me enough warning to either shut the app off or find the AC adapter.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|This review is not about the book, story or author - I will not buy this book on Kindle without Text to Speech. I am a busy reader that needs to keep a story going during my commute when I can't read - and then pick up reading when I have a break - publishers should be more concerned about selling books than limiting the medium of my unabridged consumption.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Keeps the reader on their toes anticipating what will happen next. Highly recommend the series and can't wait for more!  Excellent read.  Thanks Sylvia!
B001EJIMUG|4.0|Great plot, suffered terribly until she decided to gather her life and live it. A must see for all the ages

B00669MFA2|3.0|It's hard to choose good actors when so young.  They aren't that good.  I hope and can't wait for a remake.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I have not read this book yet but I am anxious to start. You require an answer for many products but this is the only reply I can give you at this time.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|To bad it was cancelled after only one season.  The quality of the plots varies a little by episode, but they are generally good!
B00BU18U82|3.0|This is not as good as the PC version of FS.  The controls are a little weird and jerky.  It worked okay on my Kindle Fire HD and is an okay way to kill time.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I know I'm dating myself, but the Beatles were at the forefront when I was in my teens, and their history was &#34;current affairs&#34; for me instead of history. The compilation of songs and performances are great in this anthology, and I watched it in two sittings (5 hours each!) I remember all the &#34;scandals&#34; and all the hype (that I never believed) that surrounded them (Paul is dead, they ignore royalty (Imelda Marcos, etc. - Please!?!).<br />The quality of the DVDs is good and they are informative. I wasn't aware of the anthology until my 32 year-old daughter mentioned it on a phone call (she was watching them with a roommate), and I immediately went to Amazon and found and purchased it. Like I say, they were two full days to watch, but were edited well and not at all boring. I did learn about the Beatles  history prior to their Ed Sullivan show appearance, which surprised me they had been together (and with other band members, too) for a lot longer than I had realized. All in all, I would say this is the definitive work if you want a complete history of the Beatles.
B00340I4KG|5.0|This movie is has action and was great.I would tell my friends about this movie. I give it two thumbs up.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Great Charger<br />Extremely easy to connect and even easier to use.  I no longer have to worry about batteries wearing out.  It just sits there when I am not using it and keeping my mouse charged.
B008220BP2|4.0|Goofy, funny and surprisingly cute (in a good way), \\"Warm Bodies\\" manages to be surprisingly endearing and fun. \\"R\\" (Nicholas Hoult from \\"X-Men: First Class\\")has the typical life of a zombie--shuffle aimlessly, groan and eat.<br /><br />Yes, this film does reference Romeo and Juliet (isn't it obvious?) but with a much different outcome for the star crossed lovers.<br /><br />SPOILERS: When he meets Julie (Theresa Palmer)things change; \\"R\\" finds his humanity returning his language skills expanding and he decides NOT to eat her. He does, however, end up eating his boyfriend. You see eating brains allows these zombies to experience the memories of those they kill and that only adds to the allure of Julie. He saves her. The only problem is that her dad (John Malkovich) is the lead zombie killer for their protected community. With the support of her best friend (Analeigh Tipton who steals every single scene she's in--someone give her a starring role quickly), Julie faces the challenge of convincing her father the zombies need their help to become human again and stop killing them while avoiding the boneys--zombies so far gone that they are feared by the regular zombies--and her father just isn't buying it.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />As a combo genre film (romcom/horror) \\"Warm Bodies\\" could have been a disaster but the director and writer of the script do a very good job of balancing all of these elements with the comedy flowing naturally out of the story and characters.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a detailed, rich presentation. There's a healthy amount of film grain and the cool colors of the film look very smooth. The Boneys--the main villains--are pretty scary looking although I feel that as good as they look, they could have been better integrated into the film. The lossless audio sounds marvelous with a terrific 7.1 mix that is very immersive.<br /><br />The special features include a terrific audio commentary featuring the director of the film and actors Hoult & Palmer. It's a fun, informative listen.<br /><br />There are a total of nine featurettes on the making of the film and they are informative covering everything from the airport the film was shot at to the creation of the creatures for the film. Actor Rob Corddry who gives a great performance as the friend of \\"R\\" (named \\"M\\")appears in the featurette on acting like a zombie. Corddry is a highlight of the film (and clearly deserves more screen time in films and, perhaps, his own TV series--he's a terrific character actor)and amusing. He's also a highlight of the gag reel.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />The nine deleted scenes that are included are a nice inclusion but it's pretty clear while most were cut--they don't add all that much to the film and, in fact, detract from it in most cases.film and actors Hoult & Palmer.

B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Very well done.  Don't know how true to life this was, but it was very enjoyable and revelatory for those of us who remember Alfred Hitchcock, as well as, &#34;new-comers&#34;
B008SVFX96|5.0|I bought this after seeing Richie Sambora on Craig Ferguson's talk show. Until then I didn't realize that Sambora had any cds other than ones with Bon Jovi, which I also enjoy. I really enjoy this cd and am glad I found it. I plan on looking into getting more.
B000I8HIV8|4.0|Oh yea go and see it it is really good but scary for little ones.  Robin Williams and the special effects make this a real winner.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Love this old time classic. Charles Dickens is a great author and my all time favorite Christmas movie to watch during the holidays.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A little short but it kept my attention. I enjoyed playing it, I just wish it were free to continue and complete the game.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Very captivating and well done! A surprise around every corner.  So glad I took the chance.  My husband and I both enjoyed watching this one
B00005JLIU|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theater years ago, and it's still just as good now as it was then! It's funny and entertaining. How could it not be with Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore and Carol Channing?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting, keeps the reader guessing. Love some of the descriptors.. &#34;dancing monkeys&#34;, defining &#34;unconditional love&#34;, and the relationship of &#34;Able Andy&#34; to &#34;Able Andie&#34;.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|the weather channel gives me all the info on my local weather, I love it.<br />I don't have five more words to say I love it.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I purchased this app last year (version 6)  now that version 7 is avilable I cannot run the verson i puchased.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I have had several recommendations for this book.  However, I did not take to it near as much as I expected.  I think that the actual story line is a great one, but in this case, I was not impressed with the execution.  I feel that there is a gross over-use of never and always... 'never be happy again,' and 'that picture will always stick with him.' I understand he's a teen, but after everything he's been through, I would hope he wouldn't constantly over dramatize that bad; especially since in the story, usually when he thinks I.e. I'll never be hungry/sad again, it's barely one page later that he's eating/smiling again.  Additionally, at 48% through the book, the story was still trying to explain the new vocab words we heard from the first conversation out of the Box.  Why drag that out to halfway through the story? The plot moved a lot slower than I would have preferred.  Finally, things were over foreshadowed.  I would figure out one of the mysteries/workings and it would be another 30, 60, sometimes over 100 pages further before it would be revealed in the story.  I know this is the type of story lots of people would like, and it's a relatively short read with a great underlying plot, so I still recommend giving it a try. .. it is just not for me though.  I will not be continuing this series, despite my desire to know the full evolution of the story plot.
0451169514|1.0|A lot of balderdash keeps this book afloat until the blessed final pages. The \\"horror\\" for what it is straight derivative from all those EC comics King claims as inspiration. And it shows. For \\"horror\\" we have \\"rotting corpses with their mouths filled with wet leaves - the kind of leaves you find after a storm.\\" There are mummies, werewolves, etc. but, in my mind, nothing that would count toward leaving the reader with a shudder. I never enjoyed King's work, apart from The Shining.
B000687M48|5.0|I am so in love with Amy Lee and now I have the opportunity to spend every night with her. She is the most down-home, real person I've ever seen. Her voice is beyond words. I love the concert, only wish the video didn't jump around so much. Spend more time focusing on A.L.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|so far the music being played is ok, but I like more up tempo music.<br />I prefer artist like van halen, billy idol, guns 7 roses, aerosmith, steve perry, u2.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great review of what is important in life. Best book I have read in ages.  Loved the perspective and everything except the ending..
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Moving story and hard to put down. Great book that tels an amazing story. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B0044XV684|3.0|I found this book in the children's non-fiction book section of the local public library and took it home to look over.  It is interesting since I like HP and never have looked into English cooking. Also, each recipe is from a particular HP book and chapter and these are noted for every recipe.  Several recipes are pretty straight forward.  Other recipes would have benefited from a picture.  I have made the derby savory \\"pudding\\" and pease porridge.  Both were tasty, and I would make the savory pudding again since my whole family enjoyed it.  I would try a few others, but like other reviewers have noted, there are probably better English/British cookbooks out there.  Fun to look at, fun to try.

B001N3GUIE|5.0|..the sets, the special effects, the soundtrack, the story, the cast ( Anne Francis is purr-fect ),the color, and of course, Robby the robot, make for a movie that thrills, teases playfully, and totally satisfies your space age movie thirst. Rare quality in this type of film.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I never watched before but have just started. With my amazon prime account it is free and I am enjoying it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good bug very dramatic at times. Good show to learn lawers jargon. Very good actors/actresses. I'm looking forward to watch season 2
B00BVYKWJI|4.0|I love The Borgias! Season 1 was a little better than 2, imo, but that's not uncommon. I'm really bummed they're probably cancelling it. Hopefully they will do the 2hr movie on Showtime the producer was talking about to wrap things up.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have a very small knife collection relatively speaking and this sharpener has done a fine job of maintaining a nice edge on all of my pieces. I still can't believe that such a small affordabley  priced little tool does such a great job compared to some of the much more expensive alternatives available (if you have a buddy or someone that has one of the higher priced ones go ahead and compare them and I think you will be surprised).
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Wow! this game is great if you are a creative person! build a car with rockets to blast across the ground or a super helicopter the limit of building vehicles is amazing there is so many different combinations good game!!!!
B001PJRAUS|1.0|To reform a book for the needs of a film it is ok. To kill a book like that is ... a crime!!!<br />Who loves J. Austen, never but never, has to see that movie. For sure he will be very angry !!!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|There are no words that can do justice to what Shin endured and likely will always contend with.  The author, however, delivers a concise and riveting account of Shin's nightmare and struggle to make sense of his experiences.  One can only hope that this book and Shin's efforts will bring more resources and attention to the atrocities of the Kim-led regime in North Korea.  It is near Impossible to fathom that some humans can continue to be so senselessly ruthless and completely callous in this modern world.  Many thanks to Mr. Harden and Shin for sharing this incredible story.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My grandson loved the movie..he hid his eyes a little at first but then saw the humor in the monsters..can't wait to take him to the movies to see the second one.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Well done SF series that doesn't make the viewer sit through 10 episodes before the aliens are seen. Good cast and well-written episodes make viewing a pleasure.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very good game it teaches how to care for a horse.it is A vety good children's game it teaches responsibility. Very good game.
B00B0A5XQU|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a fast read and it had a great story line identifying the many personalities that can come together if you give it a chance. I liked this novel very much.
B003NRYMZQ|2.0|With the exception of two or three episodes, the entire first season is utterly disappointing. How did the original Torchwood team ever get together to begin with?! They don't respect their boss Jack, they don't work well together, they, to a person (except Jack), are out for themselves and do the most STUPID things imaginable for a group that supposedly are professionals and have dealt with aliens and alien technology for at least some time. Gwen, at least, has an excuse for being stupid - she's new and she can get away with it for a few episodes, but neither she, nor any team member have ANY growth or maturity over the entire first season. Almost every problem situation they bring on themselves for being plainly reckless and stupid. The potential for a terrific series is there, but the writing rarely lifts the show beyond marginal sci-fi. If the writers think that because this is a BBC show shown and advertised as 'adult', that by making almost every cast member omni-sexual, adding colorful language and bedroom scenes that this could possibly lift the drama out of the quagmire of painful writing and ridiculous story lines - they are SO mistaken. It's too bad, I actually like the cast, the show looks great in HD, the Torchwood set and locations are nice, the directing is good - but the writing cripples what should be an enjoyable earth-bound sci-fi show. Let's see if season two can redeem the show. If you want to see the show at its best in season one, check out Countrycide and Random Shoes. Then follow that with Captain Jack Harkness and the finale End of Days (although pretty awful, it gives the minor tie-in at the end to Captain Jack's re-appearance in Doctor Who - for you DW fans, like myself).  Skip the rest.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Pretty much every great band/artist, no matter how good they have been over their career, will eventually release an album that just plain sucks.  This album, I'm afraid, is that album for Daft Punk.  Every album from that point forward tends to be worse than the last.  However, just like with every other band/artist, people will refuse to admit that their beloved favorite band has actually released a bad album.  They will defend it to the end, saying that the band is \\"breaking new ground\\" or \\"evolving their sound\\", rather than just admit that the new album sucks.<br /><br />I have been a huge Daft Punk fan since I first saw the video for \\"Da Funk\\" on MTV's short-lived \\"electronica\\" video show called \\"AMP\\".  Since then, they have been one of my favorite artists.  I own all their albums, including the Tron soundtrack and their live albums.  I have watched the video of their live performance at Coachella at least a dozen times.  But I have to face reality: this album blows.  Daft Punk have always created ground-breaking house/techno/electro with a distinct \\"retro-futuristic\\" vibe that only they have perfected.  This album, on the other hand, sounds NOTHING like Daft Punk, other than their signature vocoder robot voices which appear intermittently in certain tracks.  The rest of the album is a completely generic sounding mix of pop, disco, and r&b, with a tiny bit of danceable house/techno elements.  It could easily pass for a Justin Timberlake album.  And unlike previous albums, rather than make you want to get up and dance your ass off, this album is kind of a downer, with a lot of slow, \\"lost-love\\" type of songs.<br /><br />The local pop stations where I live play \\"Get Lucky\\" constantly.  No other Daft Punk song has ever had wide radio airplay.  This leads me to believe that Daft Punk is trying to \\"cash-in\\" with this album, so they don't have to work as hard at trying to be innovators.  I'm guessing that each album after this will continue to get worse and worse until they finally call it quits.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've tried many solitaire card game apps and this one is by far the best. Even though it is just a single game instead of a bundle of many, it is so well made that it beats all others hands down. It is akin tho the windows card game that used to come pre-installed on computers  many years ago. Also try the Free Cell and Spider cards games by this company...they are very worthwhile too.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|It was fun at first but then my friends kindle fire shut it down and will not turn on .SHAME ON YOU CRESCENT MOON GAMES SHAME TO YOUR COMPANY. IF YOU DO NOT FIX THIS PROBLEM I WILL GATHER ALL MY FREINDS AND FAMILY TO RIGHT BAD REVIEWS OF YOUR APP SO FIX IT OR BE DESTROYED! sorry for my over reaction but please fix it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this game to be the most intriguing game I have played in a long time. My brother played it and cannot wait to see what the next game will be.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|We've come to the point where all these novelists are breaking these stories up into multi-book series just to get money.  I had this book on my wish list because I had read the first two.  I was excited to get closure.  Instead what I get is another cliff hanger that to be resolved will be another $10.  This romance is over and I hate to say this but I'm not longer going to bother with any book that is broken up into 5 different books.  I want to pick it up, take the journey and be done.  Man I had so much hope for the Crossfire TRILOGY.  Maybe we need to demand the end of this piecemeal practice.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I really love this show and I will miss it when Season 5 ends. All of the charactors are very well written.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Just started watching...love it!! Streams with no interruptions on my kindle hd and also on my roku. wish I had watched sooner.
B0086700CM|5.0|MY kids LOVE this game!!! IT is awesome as they put it.  They say the game is realalistic and the graphics are awesome too,  They play all the time great choice in games!!!
B00683JK9K|3.0|It is okay but not enough puzzles in the game.  The scenes are really pretty and from all four seasons.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|A great study of human nature at its worst and best. I like this whole series...its hard to stop at watching only one show at a time.
B005544V6A|4.0|I started watching this show on my Kindle Fire and I watched all of season one and I plan on buying the second season this summer.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|So far so good decent graphics easy game play with plenty of levels. Just started the game a few hours ago so still learning the game
B007WFTFG6|5.0|All of us love this great little coloring book!!!!  We all color on it it is like we are all little toddlers!!! It is great!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it!  However, a number of word requirement for a review is annoying and doesn't help in getting the point.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Thinking Fast and Slow should be required reading for managers, leaders, politicians, parents, children, students. teachers - in fact just human beings generally who make decisions and weigh risks and probabilities on a daily basis (all of us). It shows clearly how we think - and explains how and why we get it wrong.<br />Kahneman explains how gut feelings and intuition can get it so right and so wrong and why although rational thought is more accurate it is also lazy. He shows how we get fooled - either intentionally or unintentionally (and I suppose how we could fool others if we were inclined).<br />If you're interested in how you and everyone else thinks, this book has amazing and juicy insights. It's not surprising Kahneman won the Nobel Prize.
0425263924|1.0|I am thoroughly disgusted with everything.....with the poor execution of this third book to the way they are trying to string readers along for another book....I bought other Sylvia Day books whilst waiting for this third crappy book...I refuse to purchase any more of her books, not even the next chapter of the Gideon and Eva so called trilogy.......
B0042TV4IW|4.0|This show is well written and acted, and I love just falling into a world that is slow paced and full of interested characters.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical drama.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|So funny, we love it all of us do.  This little cat is so funny! We tell everyone about this funny tom cat all of us play with this cat all the time!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|After the game changed from Tokyo to Miami I am no longer able to connect to Facebook, even after uninstalling and reinstalling. Otherwise it is a fun and exciting game.
B004QX07G4|5.0|i loved that it made me laugh like seriously. i would read other books and just laugh in my head. but this one i couldnt hold that laugh in. Ellen needs to make a 4th book. i love her random chapters here and there, they keep me entertained. This book is a must in your iBooks, Kindle, Nook, or book case!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Thank you Ms. Harris for bringing Sookie to such a wonderful closing. I am so glad I read your books before True Blood, I think by not following your story line they have ruined Sookie. So, if you have loved all the previous books, you're gonna love this one, it is superb!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love to listen to this type of music!  It makes everything right with the world.  Looking forward to more releases!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!!  It is great them little birds are great!  What more can u say! we all love them crazy little birds!
0670014893|4.0|It was a little like the old LeCarre (I've read them all). A little dark and no real heroes. He has always been my favorite author. I thought his age was catching up with him, but this was really good.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|When I first heard that Sweeney Todd had been made into a musical...I thought that was really, really weird.  I was imagining the lyrics, &#34;I'm going to slit your throat and make you into a pie! I'm going to eat you with a tumbler of ale and a spot of Grey Poupon while I watch American Idol!&#34;  There are just some things you cannot imagine being made into a Broadway musical.  Little did I know, until I watched the special feature, that actually Tim Burton had made a movie about something that was already a musical.<br /><br />I was really surprised that it was actually a very good movie.  The men were easier on the ears than the women.  However, the acting was superb...and I was actually willing to sacrifice singing perfection for acting perfection.  It kept a good pace, which can be a problem in musicals.  The lyrics were not ridiculous, though I don't know if the songs really &#34;grab&#34; you.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter play roles that we are accustomed to seeing them play, and yet it doesn't seem people ever get tired of seeing them play these parts because they just are so good at it! I don't know if I would want to meet them in real life, but I will always watch their movies.  Alan Rickman always impresses because he is very versatile.<br /><br />Is this film for everybody?  No.  The singing will chase away some people, and the gory topic will chase away others.  However, for a small minority, I'm sure there are some that can appreciate it.
B00AG297GK|5.0|This movie is very preposterous but that what makes it funny. It reminded me of the Austin Powers movies, but from the view of a middle eastern dictator. It is not for young kids, because there are some gruesome scenes.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Love to watch movies like this!  It stayed pretty true to the book.  We're Just waiting for the next release!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son loves this game!!!  The graphics are great!!!  HE tells everyone about the game!  My other two daughters also play the game too.  It is just AWESOME as they say.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was an instant obsession, I could not stop playing.<br />I just wish it would update with apple devices.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|At first I thought that Diary of a Wimpy Kid books were not the best, now I can't stop reading them!!! I mean why did I not start reading them in the first place. THESE BOOKS ARE AWESOME!!   That is the truth about all the books by Jeff.
B000002KXO|4.0|This 4th studio album with the Nicks-Buckingham duo of FM is simple and straight forward. It's absolutely no groundbreaking phenomenon like &#34;Rumours&#34; or experimental outing like &#34;Tusk&#34;, but to me is most like a marriage of the two. It's a good bit of poppy, radio-friendly material with a unique writing approach that was definitely beginning to be seen in the late 70s/early 80s FM material and especially Buckingham's style in the 80s. The tracks that stand out most to me are Nicks' &#34;That's Alright&#34;, and a couple of Buckingham tunes: &#34;Book of Love&#34; and &#34;Oh Diane.&#34; If you're a fan of Fleetwood Mac, you will most likely enjoy this brisk album, but it is best to understand that it is an album wedged between an experimental album (&#34;Tusk&#34;) and a return-to-popular radio album (&#34;Tango in the Night&#34;), thus making it stand in a category on it's own that can be difficult to enjoy because it fails to stand up to previous (or upcoming) albums in any way. Still a good listen.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|If you have not checked out Daft Punk's new album yet, I am here to tell you that you are missing out on a GEM of an album.<br /><br />Random Access Memories is an amazing blend of their already amazing musical art with 60's groove and 70's funk. Their music on this album is not as strictly \\"techno\\" as it used to be, so if you're looking for song styles mirroring \\"Technologic\\" or \\"Around the World\\" you won't find it on this album. However, in a musical world that's been permeated by tehcno-dance remixes and dubstep, I strongly believe their decision to give a new twist to old school styles saved them from being just another dance record gathering dust on the shelf.<br /><br />I know a lot of reviewers on here are saying they think Daft Punk is going \\"mainstream\\" because they have one song on here that's gotten some radio play; but honestly, if you listened to the whole album and came away with that thought...then, not to be rude, but you need to listen to it again because you didn't get it. This album is far from mainstream. It is an album that showcases their growth. It reminds me a lot of how some fans reacted when Linkin Park released their album A Thousand Suns - a lot of people whined because they didn't sound the same as they did when they made Hybrid Theory or Meteora. But if a band doesn't grow and try new things, they'll only become stagnant and gather dust somewhere in a fanboy's closet.<br /><br />Daft Punk has proven two things through this record:<br />1. Their art is timeless because they can adapt to the times while remaining true to themselves and their style.<br />2. Absence does make the heart grow fonder (this is their first studio album release since 2005, not counting collaborations or soundtrack work).<br /><br />If you have not listened to this album yet, give yourself an audible treat and do so.<br /><br /> Here are a few standout songs from the album for those looking for a good sample (but honestly, the whole album is pretty amazing) :<br /><br />-Beyond<br />Holy cow, what can I say about this song?<br />It starts out like an orchestra musically describing the doorway to a fantasy world and morphs into an amazing musical and lyrical journey. Just check out these lyrics to the end of the song:<br />\\"You are the night, you are the ocean<br />You are the light behind the cloud<br />You are the end and the beginning<br />A world where time is not allowed<br />There's no such thing as competition<br />To find a way we lose control<br />Remember, love's our only mission...<br />This is the journey of the soul<br />The perfect song is framed with silence<br />It speaks of places never seen<br />You hold your promise long forgotten,<br />It is the birthplace of your dreams.\\"<br /><br />The lyrics alone are proof of Daft Punk's growth in this album.<br /><br />-Give Life Back to Music<br />This song is probably the closest to their old style, but definitely has some new grooves goin' on.<br /><br />-Fragments of Time<br />If you're a fan of Earth, Wind & Fire, I'm pretty sure you'll like this song. It has a heavy 70's funk influence throughout the song and is all around a groovy song.<br /><br />-Instant Crush<br />I had an instant crush on this song, so it's aptly named. It's a great song for relaxing - very mellow beat and good guitar riffs.<br /><br />- Motherboard<br />This song is completely instrumental...and completely wonderful. If you were a fan of their work on the soundtrack for Tron: Legacy, you'll probably like this.<br /><br />So if you're ready for a musical ride, download this baby and get ready to jam! :)><br />-Beyond<br />Holy cow, what can I say about this song?<br />It starts out like an orchestra musically describing the doorway to a fantasy world and morphs into an amazing musical and lyrical journey.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Really!!! Come on sylyvia day? This is what we been waiting for. I didn't eveving buy the book, I purchase a free sample and new that was some bull!! It started with the same bull, he's so hot, and his body is perfect really!!! sylvia day. You made people wait for this, I hope the taste of seduction is worthy.

B00BI73CVI|5.0|I love this musical..it is my favorite I believe everyone should watch it! Very heartfelt and sad as well as uplifting story
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|... not so much. This mouse functions perfectly, precise tracking, fast responses, and good overall design. The latter is where I have a personal issue - the mouse isn't that comfortable for me. I'm coming from a Logitech MX, and was hoping for a mouse a bit larger in design, or at least a bit taller (yes, I read the specs but was expecting the stretched design to be optimal). Also, the plastics feel very 'thin' and insubstantial - lots of smooth, high-gloss surfaces (no textures)... this can be a comfort issue since it feels a bit sweaty/slick after some use. Also not helping its lack of 'substantial' feel, is the lightness of the mouse in general (again goes back to thin materials), and I added every weight they offer - but it really doesn't change the feel at all. Overall good mouse, and probably great for those that the mouse fits well and are looking for value, but for me... meh, 2.5 stars at best.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|It captures with amazing sound the Queen songs and Fredy energy on the stage, even is an old concert the image is good enough
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Angry Birds is great.  It is a very addictive game for everyone!  It is for everyone no matter what age!  we all enjoy the birds
B008KP6ENE|1.0|This app IS A VIRUS! I downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire, played the game for a while, and my Kindle Fire FROZE! It didn't turn on for HOURS! DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!! B.T.W. the app is boring anyway.  SO DON'T GET IT!!!! :O
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this app. But my brother has it for the iPod touch, and I have it for the Kindle Fire. He has 0.7.1 and I still don't have 0.7.0. Please make it so that they get the updates at the same time.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Writing my first book was a pleasure and I hope to do more. It was fairly easy, not like falling off a log, but doable.
B008SOS63S|5.0|After discovering Joe Bonamassa earlier this year on youtube, Live from NY, I went to his concert in Philly.<br />Great Album, great Guitarist!
B005HED11Y|5.0|It is relaxing to see the way shows were made in years past.  Shows of today are of low standards.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|I bought this CD mainly for the song Rock Bottom I had heard on the radio, but wanted to listen to some of their other music as well. The guitars on this album are fantastic with Michael Schenker and mainly bought it for that reason and wanted to add more metal to my 3400 song library on my iPhone. I prefer to buy the CD's with usual enclosed artwork and booklets that come with them rather than mp3 downloads. On Amazon you can get great prices on new and used CD's and usually take advantage of Amazon's Prime shipping when possible. I've bought used CD's in like new condition from other vendors too for as low as 1 cent plus the $3.99 shipping......still a great deal! Have had nothing but good  experiences with all the vendors I've purchased from on Amazon and buy all my music here. They all seem to really want to satisfy their customer!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a really fun strategy game.  Kill a little time without killing brain cells!  Challenging enough to not get boring, but simple enough to still be relaxing.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I have seen just about every episode even some of the home made custom ones,some of the carters species are out of time sync, Note this was my first in theater 3D movie I have ever seen, the last movie I got to see in theater was the 2009 ver before 3D tech and in HD
B00475AYJQ|5.0|There is very little that I can say in this review that hasn't been covered by others. It is a delightful book. One that is consistently charming and delightful, despite the huge scope and great length. It is also a book that marks a departure from current fantasy tropes and styles--that tend to the dark, even pitch black, and very cynical (starting with The Black Company and continuing through current fiction like Abercrombie and Lawrence) and can, at times, seem like a race to the bottom to depict the darkest sides of the human condition.<br /><br />In contrast, Rothfuss' cleaves to a different tradition, older (and more timeless?) than his modern compatriots. The clearest progenitor of his work I can think of is Patricia McKillip's The Riddlemaster of Hed, and the books of Lawrence Watt Evans. Perhaps early Tad Williams, although Rothfuss' is much more intimate and tender in his portrayal of events, even when those events have a wide scope.<br /><br />Rothfuss' tale continues to be character driven in a way that few are these days. Kvothe, arrogant, ambitious, heedless, and charming drives the story entirely. I can think of no other modern fantasy tale that revolves so entirely around its hero to the exclusion of all other stories. And in this the author succeeds. Wildly so.<br /><br />As a result, the novel is surely one of the highlights of the last few years, in every way living up to the promise of the prior novel, The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />Just read it. Soon.<br /><br />And a quick postscript: for those wanting answers to the central questions of the Kingkiller Chronicles--you will not find them here. And, if I had to venture a guess, you will not find them in Book 3. It seems apparent that the third day of storytelling will deal with the fall of Kings and nations at war. I highly doubt that amidst all this, Rothfuss and Kvothe will find a way to deal with the Chandrian. My guess is that arc will be the topic of a second trilogy. Just a guess, and a bit of a warning to those that feel they need satisfaction sooner rather than later!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a new favorite, definitely the best film I've seen this year. Very well done and superbly acted, I highly recommend this to all types of viewers.
B00009MGGI|5.0|My all time favorite series; Ian Richardson is magical to watch; it's set the bar for perfection I can't find anywhere again. Great.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I have always wanted to spend a couple years in Europe's Middle Ages.  This beautiful, imaginative production engages the imagination even if the storyline weren't as captivating and compelling as it is.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This CD was bought as a birthday gift for my mother and it was quite enjoyable and fun to listen to. Mr. Buble is this current generation's version of Frank Sinatra, but with a style and technique of his own. This music is ideal for social gatherings such as holidays with the family or if you need to unwind after a long day at work or you just want to unplug yourself from the world and in need of quiet time. You won't go wrong with listening to Michael Buble.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It's great to see Arnold back at it again.  He does this kind of movie well and he certainly doesn't disappoint here.  Last Stand is not a bad movie, but falls fall short of some of Schwarzenegger's past works, such as Total Recall, Terminator 2, True Lies and Kindergarten Cop.  Perhaps the greatest short-coming of this film is that here we have a Sheriff with a thick Austrian accent working in a border town near Mexico and we are asked to believe that.  Still, The Last Stand is an entertaining, albeit very dumb film that you might find yourself enjoying the absurdity of it all.  We are, after all, talking about Arnie and he is, much to my own enjoyment, at least, back where he belongs.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great reading,just finished reading for the second time and will read again and again, but for now am on to reading book 2.<br />Deborah please keep this series going.........
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book was worth the wait. I can hardly wait  for more books from the shifters,or the arrows  . Bring it on!
B005X5XIL0|5.0|I bought this gift for my mother as a Mother's Day gift and she was overjoyed and happy with it. Andrea Bocelli is one of my mother's favorite performers and this item is worth every penny.
0399165274|3.0|I saw the book and wondered why I had never read one of his books, though I had been aware of him for a long time.  Possibly a long time ago I did read Day of the Jackal.  However I think I very quickly found out why I had not read anything else of his.  I started reading and wondered when he would get to the story.  If you would cut out all of the character development the book would be a short story.  I couldn't care less of the life story from birth of Kit Carson, for example.  I saw where another reviewer said the book was boring, and I agree.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|the plot of the book i found suspenceful and unusual.Showing a man capable of killing, to for an attachment with this unusual  mature young girl.  Again a thriller from Baldacci
0345525558|4.0|This book really opens your eyes to the foster care system.  Learning about flowers was a bonus! Very enjoyable but predictable ending
B003Y5H4Y8|1.0|A real disappointment - great actors but a real let down of a storyline.  I kept waiting for the movie to get better and that never happened.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|i liked this movie only because i saw the first one (before sunrise) and plan<br />on seeing the current movie of the trilogy.  less action than the first movie, just<br />a long walk thru paris..........
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I was disappointed that the acting was stiff and scenes that should have been magic seems not to have much imagination.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I watch this every time it is on my PBS station.  Was tired of all the interruptions so now I can watch this magnificent performance straight through  Talking about the DVD not the mp3
B00C27LB20|5.0|I was relatively skeptical because he is a suggested artist on mtv, and in all honesty, mtv can have have, does have, questionable taste in music.  But  despite that, his music is a good balance of Indie, folk and country. He sounds different, even though he reminds me  sometimes of Dylan and Simon &Garfunkel. I see a classic sound to his work that possesses longevity, meaning, his music can stand up to the test of time or so i believe. And his song, Simple as This? Hands down one of my favorite pieces ever.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|This show is fantastic, hands down. To me, it was a breath of fresh air in terms of plot and acting. Definitely not your run of the mill television show. Every episode it great, and it's worth having on DVD to watch again and again.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is at times frustrating but always exciting. Besides the fun of bingo itself, the chat feature has helped me make friends from all around the globe.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love uno.  It is such a fun and challenging game.  I usually play when I am getting my nails done--doesn't require much technique!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Music is relaxing... game isn't easy but also doesn't put a big you lose if you get stuck... lovely game... totally worth it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I must admit I was disappointed at the end of this book but not because of the contents... I was angry that this was the final installment and that there was no more... I read all of the books in a matter of days and loved them from start to finish! I recommend for anyone who likes dystopian literature!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I only wish there were more than 5 seasons. With the ability to &#34;Change&#34; their world - this really could have gone on for many more seasons.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This is a great series. Dexter delivers season after season. Give this one a try.... I know you will love it!!
B0079XPUOW|2.0|Yes, yes, this is a fun idea that quickly loses all of its inherent humor and goes sideways into a not that interesting story.  Sorry, I like much of Scalzi's work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read it in only 3 days after reading the first one and its almost as good as the first! Keeps you on the edge of your seat while reading.
B006QV7YN8|5.0|The book itself is great, of course.  But this review is primarily concerned with formatting of the kindle edition.  This is very well done, with footnotes easy to access.  The only criticism is that it would be good if notes which link to a previous note (as in &#34;See Note to 7:56&#34;) were also hyperlinked to that note. But this is a minor quibble.  Good edition.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The acting is incredible.  The law cases are interesting.  The family drama is gripping!  It's hard to stop watching...my husband and I find ourselves having 'The Good Wife' marathons!!!

B005GFPZYK|4.0|A good story but was more about Chris's life and experiences than the intricacies of a sniper. His life going through sniper school would have been awesome. A Great War story.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Its a book I haven't read this cause it won't let me read kindle fire.. 123 let me read ok...
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Too many glitches.  My game no longer links to my facebook account, and I have lost my progress twice. I no longer enjoy playing this game.
B004XE0TDW|5.0|If Sting (from \\"The Dream of Blue Turtles\\" era) sat in with The Dave Matthews Band (during \\"Crash\\") this would be the result.  If they decide to put Bon Iver's Austin City Limits performance on DVD and/or vinyl, THAT will be worth 6 STARS.  I came across them channel surfing and was instantly glued to the tube.  They are absolutely phenomenal!!  I was a huge DMB fan until their stuff got a little too overproduced and slick for my taste.  Sting left a bad taste in my mouth after selling out to Puff Daddy (\\"I'll Be Missing You\\" anyone??).  Anyway, The live performance of this album evokes early DMB & The Police/Sting and fills the void left.  Sadly the only way you can see or hear it is on a PBS re-run or Youtube.

B008Y79IUE|1.0|While I appreciate the need for an artist to express one's opinion, this movie was so depressing, I found very little value for me personally.  If you don't want to see the ultimate downer, than stay away from this movie.  If on the other hand you enjoy this kind of stuff, rent it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best app I have. Get it. This is a great game with good updates. Get it at all costs. Love it.

I set it to allow permission for them to use the camera but they can't access the gallery to make changes.  This app is a must have for every parent that allows their kids to use their devices. LOVE IT! Thank you 2 guys with no budget for marketing! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|So I skimmed through the reviews before I finished reading the book, and most reviews say the end is horrible.  I rushed through the book and paced back and forth when I reached the end thinking something awful would happen.  Don't believe the hype.  The end wasn't bad at all (it definitely wasn't as good as the ending for Reflected In You).  I think what upset readers the most was the fact that the series was initially supposed to be a trilogy and everyone wanted to see Eva and Gideon have their happily ever after.  However, there will be two additional books added to the series.  There were many unanswered questions, but those questions did not revolve around the nature of Gideon and Eva's relationship, those two are SOLID AS A ROCK despite the MANY issues that are thrown their way.  Even if this was the final book, I'd still be pleased because Eva and Gideon have gone through so much and have still bounced back proving their love can't be broken.  Not many books have held my interest to keep reading but this one did.  However, I'm not going to be on pins and needles anticipating book #4 but I will be happy to read it once it comes out.  My suggestion is to read the book for yourself and judge.  But overall I loved the book, the ending was a little weak but I think Sylvia will bring it on home with the next two books.
B009AZZ6H8|3.0|I guess they have to shake off 16 years of rust.  I'd be cautious buying this if you loved Badmotorfinger/Superunknown etc.  This one is only for diehard fans :/

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This has represented a quest for almost half my life...and only represents the end of the path of three years in the book's time. However, it was a good ending to an epic story, resolving the disparate ends of the Wheel of Time. Rand, Egwene, Mat, Perrin and Nynaeve meet their future and fates at the battle to end the age. I love this series, and although I'm glad I know the ending, I am sad that it is ended.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|not much of a plot, good if u need to kill time and don't want to think,good for destruction,blood no guts

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Everything about this movie is well done. Great acting. Great storyline. Great suspense (even though you know the ending...you still grit your teeth at moments and are anxious) All around great movie that leaves you with good old fashion American pride. (If you're American, that is)
0767903862|5.0|I enjoy Bryson's writing very much.  this is a laugh out loud book.  I put this book down knowing far more about this expansive nation.

B00785P2QC|5.0|Feel like the game does take a while to gain lots of points and credits, it's a virtual city, and it takes time to get money in real life.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Good read but disappointed with the anti_climatic ending. I didn't get some of the characters, they seems very \\"run on\\". Guess we'll hear about a follow up soon. I needed an ending.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|But a fun read nonetheless.  I enjoy the writing in these novels, and I'm excited to see where the next one takes us.

B0061PEAUY|4.0|I started reading this series year's ago when I stumbled upon one at my local library and thought I'd give it a shot. I love to learn as I read and Kathy Reich's sure does provide us with a lot of knowledge.  I have enjoyed each of the books I have read this far with the exception of Spider Bones. I found the hard back on sale and found it to be very predictable. I only finished it to prove I was right about who did it. When amazon had this novel for the kindle on sale I decided to give it another go. I was not disappointed this time. Another great book by Ms Reich's.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Like a lot of people, I've heard the hype about Hugh Howey and Wool, so I couldn't resist picking it up. It is an original concept with engaging characters and is written in an easy-to-read style that both fans of sci-fi and people who don't normally read the genre would find it entertaining. The only detraction is that there are a few times in the book when it feels like things were stretched a bit to meet a word count.<br />Overall, I'd recommend Wool to anyone.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Item was delivered quickly and in good condition. The story is a timeless love story that highlights Nicholas Sparks talent for this genre. The actors capture their characters perfectly and the story leaves you feeling every emotion associated with a deep love.

B009MEEZXI|5.0|Well, I always enjoy accurate biographies which are inspirational... this one does not disappoint. As a high school teacher, this movie inspired me to continue to reach out to my autistic students and encourage their success, as well as being open to what I can learn from them. I am also very interested in stock animal behavior. Watching Temple Grandin opened new \\"doors\\" of understanding for me. A must-see, I loved it!

B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is a show I never get tired of watching. I never miss it and I've watched the reruns more times than I can remember. Even now I will have the USA channel reruns on in the background while I work around the house.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|I was disappointed that the vampires didn't feature much in this book at all. It felt empty without them.  Having said that, it was a very good way to finish the series.  We all wondered how it would end for Sookie and I don't think Charlaine Harris could have done any better for our Sook.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|This is a fun game.  The graphics are good and the music isn't bad.  It's easy to learn, but challenging enough to keep your interest.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I love the originial Star Wars movies. I remember going to the theater when I was 8 years old in 1977 to see the Star Wars, A New Hope. I desperately wanted the movies on Blu Ray and I am glad to get these but, I do prefer the original no the re-mastered and tinkered over editions. I would have given this product 5 stars if it was my beloved original versions.<br /><br />Still, it's good for a new generation as my kids, nephews, and nieces start to watch them!
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|I chose this because we did a lesson for school on the author of Beatrix Potter. The students were able to determine fiction and non-fiction
B001DUKHXQ|2.0|The shipping and delivery were smooth, but the vinyl disc itself has sound issues.<br /><br />I don't know if I was the unlucky one to get a bad copy, but even if it looks completely clean, it has a lot of clicks like if I just put an old, dirty record. It also has this weird issue were every time an S is pronounced, it sounds like static, although I am not sure if this specific problem is caused by my sound system.<br /><br />All these issues are more evident on Side B. Beat It and Billy Jean jump at a few places, always on the same spots, so my record player is not the issue. The aforementioned weird S noise is more evident on Human Nature and Pretty Young Thing.<br /><br />After eagerly awaiting for this disc to arrive, I've been disappointed by the sound quality.<br /><br />I would request a replacement or a refund, but sending stuff back is a bit of a hassle to me, which in this case, I'd rather avoid.
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|I may reveal a MAJOR spoiler in my first paragraph.  It would probably be best to only read my review if you've already seen Looper.<br /><br />Looper has amazing special effects borrowed from the Matrix obviously, but the storyline is REALLY confusing.  It's a science fiction flick about a man who works as a mob hit man protecting a farmland woman and her supernatural Village of the Damned-inspired child from a 30-year old version of *himself*.  Do you follow?  Because it's extremely confusing.  In other words, Bruce Willis returns 30 years later to communicate with -and prevent- the younger version of himself (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) from making the same horrible regrettable mistakes that cost his Asian wife her life as a result of a mob shooting.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes is *nothing* but confusion, but as soon as Bruce and Joseph meet up at a restaurant (after the realization that Joseph *shouldn't* try killing his older self at every immediate opportunity) this is when the storyline improves.  It's sort of funny to me however, when Joseph was simply standing in a cornfield pointing a gun at an empty blanket waiting for Bruce's character to appear so he can shoot him, lol.<br /><br />It's sort of annoying that the writers didn't make Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt one and the same.  In other words, they should have simply either disguised Bruce as a younger man during the segments that involve Joseph, or disguise Joseph as an older person during the parts that portray the older version of himself.  Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt look *nothing* alike.  Hard to follow I know, haha.<br /><br />Looper is also loaded (overloaded) with abrupt and VERY direct gun shootings of the violent variety.  Be prepared for these or you'll be knocked through your roof in complete shock.  They are always LOUD and very sudden, but the actual talking/conversations taking place between the characters throughout the film is really quiet.  Not a good combination.  Throw in an Asian woman who's presence never made sense to me (I *thought* I was beginning to make some sense of this storyline 30 minutes in but I was wrong- wasn't Joseph's character supposed to find *this* girl and protect her?  Why did he stick around the farmlands and form a relationship with the other woman instead?) and you have a very bizarre movie.<br /><br />I think it's also strange that the action in the beginning takes a dramatic turn later on and mellows out considerably once Joseph's character falls in love with a farmland girl.  This portion of the film takes up the entire second half.  Really strange.  Overall, one of the most confusing science fiction films you'll ever see.  You know now that I think about it, I normally have trouble following mob movies, and science fiction films can either be really easy or really hard to follow (no in between) so... now I know why Looper made a loop around my head, lol.
0425263916|5.0|I love, love, love, this book! Kept me coming back when I had things do to. Stayed up late finishing it. Couldn't put it down. Very sexy.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A very good book for children, whether being read to ones not yet able to read, together with ones beginning to read, or by ones able to read by their self. The solid growth of affection by the characters could not but convey itself to any reader.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|ThIs book was recommended by a friend and it was better than I expected. Defending Jacob grabs you at the very beginning and it is a book you don't want to put down.  Love it and will recommended to others.
1781162646|4.0|Okay, so I'll be honest up front and say the only two reasons I got the book in the first place was 1.) It's Stephen King and I love his stuff and 2.) I needed something while I waited for Doctor Sleep in September. That's the one I'm really looking forward to. I had some hopes and expectations, but overall the description didn't grab me and make me go \\"Ooooo...I want to read THAT one!\\"<br /><br />But am I ever glad I did.<br /><br />King just has one of the best unique literary voices out there in my opinion which makes a lot of his stuff just fun to read. Joyland was no exception. All of the characters were great and I don't think there was one that was unnecessary to the plot. If you read this, you'll meet some interesting folks...carnies and non-carnies.<br /><br />Devin Jones (Jonsey to his carny pals) was a wonderful narrator and easy for me to identify with. There may have been a few times where he was a bit too much the Boy Scout for believability reasons, but not excessively so. I think what makes him a good main character/narrator is that I WANT there to be more people like him out there in the real world. We could sure use a few.<br /><br />The carny/amusement park setting was pretty fascinating as it's become fairly unused these days, though as I understand it there used to be a lot more \\"carny crime\\" books many moons ago. Perhaps not a surplus, but enough for it to have it's own category.<br /><br />The other thing about this book in particular was the ghost. There is one, but it sort of takes a back seat in this story. This isn't The Shining or Bag of Bones where the haunting is the main thing, i.e. it's not the plot but rather an important plot device. I'm a lover of ghost stories (having written [[ASIN:B005MF8AYQ A Ghost of Fire (Ghostly Elements)]] and [[ASIN:B008WJDJN6 A Ghost of Water (Ghostly Elements)]] with two more on the way) and I was hoping for more of a straightforward haunting story...but you know what? I wasn't bothered by the way it worked out. In fact, if it had been a more straight forward ghost story, it might not be as effective of a story. Joyland isn't about the ghosts. It's about the people.<br /><br />I recommend it. It's a great human tale of transitioning from youth to adulthood.ked out.

B00BEXB18M|5.0|Being a long time Megadeth and all forms of Metal fan (except for Glam and Nu Metal), I must say I really loved the Super Collider CD! I started to listen to Heavy Metal and Hard Rock in the seventies (Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Kiss, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Nazareth, Rainbow and Rush). I was there in the early eighties listening to Iron Maiden (NWOBHM), Def Leppard, Scorpions, Dio, Lita Ford, Ozzy Osbourne, Yngwie Malmsteen, W.A.S.P., etc. Then the Trash Metal movement came in (mid 80's) and that was a special gift of the Gods for me (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax and Testament). I love the \\"Big Five\\" bands! In fact, I have all the CD's from the \\"Big Five\\"! Late eighties, early nineties saw the birth of Death Metal and I love Death (+ Control Denied), Sepultura, Amon Amarth, Children of Bodom, etc. During the nineties we also had Pantera (groove metal). What an amazing band!... It's also great to listen to \\"younger\\" bands from the \\"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\\" and Metalcore like Lamb of God, Trivium, As I Lay Dying and Mastodon. As you see, I've been listening to metal for almost 40 years (I'm 50 years old now). I'm not and have never been affraid of enjoying new sounds and new genres of Metal and Hard Rock. And that's what Megadeth bring for us with the Super Collider CD: something new!!! Don't be scared! Dave Mustaine is trying to do something different, but heavy! Really heavy!!! \m/
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was an AWESOME story! Her husband got his in the end. The letter left for her to read made me cry. Her friend was just a ghost pushing her in the right direction. They made a great couple. She interacted with his children wonderfully. Good job, Julianne!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is like Temple Run but better according to my seven year old. Lots of fun for kids. Very entertaining for adults as well.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|this game is pretty cool. I like the hidden object games in order to obtain necessary objects and how you get to play the part of an investigator. it is so awesome!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Well, I finished \\"Entwined with You\\" last night and I wasn't impressed.  This left me disappointed.  The only real substance was the last 5 chapters.  I felt like this book was just a way to prolong the series, which is fine with me.  However, the author could've done a better job.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I can't even believe how amazing this cd is. Emeli Sande is out of this world talented. Next to me is just the beginning. You must add this album to your collection!
B0042IDMPG|5.0|I this is an amazing album & band. I can't compare them to anyone. They amazing super aliens that make awesome spacey music.
B009NY43NY|1.0|For the last two to three books I should have know that I was reading trash. It took this book to really finalize my conclusion that this series was not going to get any better and everything in this book was not thoughtful, interesting, or anything the first eight books were. Relationships were contradictory, characters out if character ( in the worst way) and the plot made my mind numb in the first two chapters
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is the best show on TV right now. I was a huge fan of pushing daisies. Hannibal is well written and visually stunning.
B008Y6SLL2|5.0|Gripping, tense thriller that zeroes in on some of the reasons why the crash happened, and the greed that tried to cover it up.  And points out how expendable the people are when the ones at the top need someone to throw under the bus.
B00AW28HF6|3.0|I am not a fan of political books but I did enjoy reading this book. The pace of the book is quick and the chapters relatively short so it is an easy book to be able to read, even if you are busy.<br />Kafira and Zack are top agents required to work deep under cover. The plot centres on their relationship both professional and personal; as is the case with Kafira's handler and step mother.<br /><br />If you are a fan of political plots the this one will not disappoint.<br />The plot is twisty and intriguing. But I do not want to give the book away by telling the end!<br /><br />My criticism would be the 'personal' dialog is a bit stilted at times. Some of the scenes described confused me a little as I couldn't see where, some things as a reader that I was been told, fitted in. The book does jump about a bit, but I could cope with that to a certain extent.<br />The story ended a bit abruptly but I do hope that is because the story continues.<br /><br />So all in all this book is worth a read. It is enjoyable to read and the main characters are deep and interesting. They have the capacity to be explored more deeply as their story infolds in other books.

1439181780|5.0|I actually read the whole thing on my iPad, but loved it so much that I just had to own the hard copy as well, and I'm glad I did. The look and feel of this book is unlike any other. It's absolutely beautiful, and the pages are nice and glossy. Looks very high quality much like the content of the book. I'd definitely recommend this as well as the two other books, The Secret and The Magic, if you're looking to give a splash of inspiration to your life.

B009UNGYHG|3.0|I had an original Plantronics Voyager Pro and still love it, but I liked some of the features of the new Legend (caller name announce, etc.) and when I ordered it, I also ordered this case.  It might be useful for those who don't charge their earpiece often enough, or if you travel and want a protective case.  But I WEAR my earpiece when I travel, that's the whole point of it...and I charge it every night when I'm using it, so I don't need the extra 2-charge battery this unit offers.  Further, when I take my earpiece off and want to charge it, I just clip it to the cool new magnetic charging cable without having to fold or change the angle of the earpiece. With this case, you have to fold the earpiece to fit exactly into the molded tray or it doesn't fit, doesn't charge, and the lid doesn't close. It works, and there's nothing wrong with it... I just wouldn't buy it again.

I watched it with my 14 year old and he was &#34;blah&#34; about it in the beginning but it didn't take long and he was completely engaged with the movie. I'm glad we watched it and will revisit it again in the future.

B005HED08I|5.0|The characters are interesting and entertaining. The episodes are interesting. I watched a couple of episodes just to see what it was about and pretty soon I had watched the entire first season and started on the second season. It is a great show with a great mix of comedy, drama, and adventure.
0739343718|4.0|INTRO - \\"They were young, educated and both virgins on their wedding night, and they lived in a time when conversation about sexual differences was plainly impossible....\\"<br /><br />Prior to starting this audio book, I really had no idea what it was about, as I had downloaded it to my iPod when it was first released in 2007 and hadn't thought much about it since.  When I first started listening to it, I knew immediately that I would be wishing that I hadn't waited so long to try this one.  (5) hours and fewer than 200 pages, I really liked it.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1962, a time when it wasn't all that unusual for women and even some men to be virgins when they married --Florence Ponting and Edward Mayhew are such a couple.  They come from very different backgrounds, Edward is a historian and the son of a school master and, Florence is a lead violinist and the daughter of a wealthy industrialist and professor.<br /><br />The couple is honeymooning at the Georgian hotel on \\"Chesil Beach\\". While Edward is extremely anxious to consummate their marriage, he is also very worried about pleasing his new bride.  Florence on the other hand, is frightened and almost disgusted about the thought of sex.<br /><br />QUOTE ---<br />'The idea of being touched  \\"down there\\", by someone else, even someone she loved, was as repulsive as, say, a surgical procedure on her eye.'<br /><br />Florence had read the \\"wedding manual\\" which outlined what to expect on the wedding night. She knew that first, they would dine and have a special meal, but no way was she prepared for what was to happen later that night.<br /><br />I wonder if the author intended for this novel to be one that would make some modern day readers laugh? I just couldn't keep the smile off my face at times.  I found the writing to be so well done and even tender at times.  Learning all about the couple, their background, their hopes and their fears made them seem all the more real.  The 60s setting, prior to the sexual revolution, seemed to showcase realistically both sex and class in England during that time.  Another thing I liked was that the author was able to pack a punch in fewer than 200 pages. He was able to show readers that every event in our lives, even something that might seem insignificant at the time, can really affect us for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />If you haven't read this already, you should try it. I hated to see it end.the sexual revolution, seemed to showcase realistically both sex and class in England during that time.

0385349831|3.0|This book was just OK for me. There are some (many) nuggets of wisdom here, but they're really not cohesive and, as one other reviewer noted, the author quotes from the Bible without citing chapter/verse...minor thing, but irksome. Still, there is a lot here to recommend. It's just not what you might expect.

B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Taking a page out of the \\"Toy Story\\" book, \\"Wreck It Ralph\\" is about the characters that populated our childhood, and what they do when we're not watching. (Unlike Woody and Buzz, however, these guys don't give a darn if the kids who play with them like them or not. It's just a job.) Ralph is the bad guy in a video game titled \\"Fix It Felix, Jr.\\" that occupies space in an old-fashioned arcade - the kind that actually took quarters and was managed by a guy wearing, for some mysterious reason, a referee's striped shirt.<br /><br />When the arcade closes and the kids go home, the characters' lives go on. But Ralph doesn't have much of a life, because he's a bad guy, and everybody in his game hates him. The rest of the characters throw a party, but they don't invite Ralph. Instead, he goes to a Baddies Anonymous meeting, where he commiserates with Zangief (from \\"Street Fighter\\") and Bowser (from an endless number of \\"Mario\\" games) about how hard it is to be a bad guy. Zangief reminds him that \\"just because you are Bad Guy, doesn't mean you are bad...guy!\\" Their motto as a group is \\"I'm bad, and that's good.\\" The meeting doesn't help Ralph much, maybe because he's not the one that needs to hear it. What they really have is a PR problem; instead of sitting in an Anonymous meeting, these bad guys really should be taking their message to the streets.<br />Ralph decides he's going to win a medal, just like Felix does, and thus win the love and respect of the folks in his game. So he sneaks into a HALO-style first person shooter and steals the medal from the end, in the meanwhile setting off a chain of events that threaten the existence of the entire video game sub-world.<br /><br />This all happens in the first half hour, and, if this were just an average movie, I would be able to guess the rest of the film at this point in it. Ralph would spend the next 60(ish) minutes trying to clean up the mess he'd made, and in the process, he would save the video game world, and at theend, just when he thinks of himself as a bad guy for real, everyone would see him as a hero and they would give him the medal he so badly wanted and tried to steal.<br /><br />But this is a better, more interesting film than that. Ralph gets himself into trouble, and is plunged in to the candy-coated world of Sugar Rush, a go-kart racing game where nobody is quite what they seem. He loses his medal to a punk kid voiced by Sarah Silverman, and is forced into an agreement with her where if he helps her win a big race, she'll give him his medal back. But then King Candy, the ruler of Sugar Rush (voiced by Alan Tudyk, doing a spot-on and very entertaining impression of Ed Wynn from \\"Mary Poppins\\" and \\"Alice in Wonderland\\") pulls him aside to explain that if the kid is allowed to win the race, it would spell doom for the entire game, as well as certain death for her. What's Ralph to do?<br /><br />\\"Wreck It Ralph\\" does an excellent job of layering its exposition, so that a seemingly throwaway comment in one scene suddenly becomes an important plot point ten or twenty minutes later.  That's a pretty simple storytelling principle (though it's far too often ignored in Hollywood,) but what's really impressive is that these comments never feel like they're being dropped on purpose; it's never obvious that the screenwriters are telling us something we'll need to know later in the story.  That takes talent, and it's on display here.  \\"Wreck It Ralph\\" creates and inhabits a clearly unbelievable world, but it's written so well that it feels more believable, more lived in, than some movies that purport to exist in the real world.  Contrast this, for instance with \\"Looper;\\" that movie did a lot of things right, but the hints it dropped were so clunky and obvious that they broke the illusion; I knew what was coming well before it came, and spent nearly the last half of the film bored.<br /><br />Another of the things that I loved about this film was that both main characters' questfor actualization puts their respective worlds in jeopardy.  When Ralph is absent from \\"Fix It Felix, Jr.\\" the game can't function, and the real world owner of the arcade (the guy in the referee shirt) prepares to junk it. The punk kid (I've been avoiding her name, because it's such an unholy mouthful, but for the record, it's Vanellope Von Schweetz) feels in her bones that she's a racer, but following that impulse threatens to bring her whole world down around her ears.  Their problems look like personal problems, but really, they're community problems; for both of them, the perspective of their entire community is going to need to shift before things can be restored to order and harmony.<br /><br /> That's an awfully academic paragraph about a kids' movie.  But \\"Wreck It Ralph\\" isn't your run-of-the-mill kids' movie. It passed the kids' test in my house; my 4 year old likes it, though she thinks the bugs are too scary. I like it, too, because it offers something deeper, meatier and more nuanced for adult eyes.  And I'm not just talking about the '80s video game references that go right over my pre schooler's head.  This is one I won't mind watching over and over again.<br /><br />Random Notes:<br /><br />A lot of critics complained about the \\"Sugar Rush,\\" segment of the film, saying that it was nauseatingly bright, aimed at drawing girls into the movie, and rife with product placement.  But go-cart racing games are ALWAYS like that.  Mario Kart exists in a cartoon world, that's part of what makes it so fun.  So does Diddy Kong Racing, and CTR, the two I played the most (and love the best) those college days I was supposed to be writing essays about Kierkegaard.  As a twenty something male, I would have played Sugar Rush.  I would have obsessed over it.<br /><br />If I have one complaint with \\"Wreck-It Ralph,\\" it might be that the voice actors are a little TOO familiar, if that's possible.  Jack McBrayer makes Felix basically the same character as the one he playson 30 Rock.  McBrayer's a funny guy, but it's disappointing he doesn't have more range.  Same with Jane Lynch; she's basically playing Sue Sylvester in an armored suit, right down to the weird verbal stylings (\\"Fear is a four letter word, ladies.  If you want to go pee pee in your big boy slacks, keep it to yourself\\" is totally something Sue would say.)<br /><br />I have to admit - the nostalgia kicked in.  I had to stop the film multiple times to Wikipedia video games I had forgotten about but had spent countless hours playing when I was a kid.<br /><br />One thing Ralph gets wrong: Asteroids and Centipede are two of very few games from 30 years ago that are still around.<br /><br />Would Skrillex really play \\"Celebration\\" by Kool & the Gang at a party?  Hard to believe.<br /><br />They seem to be intentionally messing with gender stereotypes in the gamers.  A little girl plays Hero's Duty, and it's two jerk boys who tell her they're going to spend all day playing Sugar Rush.<br /><br />One thing that's always bothered me about \\"Toy Story.\\"  How in the world can Buzz not be aware he's a toy if he has to go rigid and plastic every time Andy walks in the room?  Does he just black out and not remember being played with?

B00CATSONE|5.0|This thesis dispelled the view that great inventors were motivated by advancement in science more than personal recognition and financial reward. Obviously the former is fueled by the latter. Advancement requires benefactors who are risk takers. Kind of justifies capitalism,but not in an altruistic sense.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|Caught an sample of this band on the car rad-ness.  The tune (Feels Like We Only Go Backwards) has a ging and snap that haunts you.  Rushed home to search the rad stantion's playlist to identify it.  After playing a few sound samples, I ordered all of Tame Impala's CDs.  Richly layered tunage that brings to mind many tunes from decades ago, yet refreshingly contemporary its own right.

I wish I could be more definite about it, but one month later I can barely remember the characters or the plot points, except that this is the umpteenth variation on the Oliver Twist plot that seems currently to obsess fantasy writers. Style OK as far as I can remember. O yes ! The main character's name is deftly written into the plot. This I remember.
B001E9641K|5.0|The TTR series is a family favorite.  This edition of the game is for two or three plays.  (The original is best when played by 3 or 4 players.)  This is more challenging than the Switzerland (expansion board).<br /><br />We have at least four versions of Ticket To Ride, but this has become my favorite.

0756404746|2.0|This is the only fantasy book I've read besides the Lord of the Rings Series and A Song of Ice and Fire. I agree with most of the criticisms you see from two-star reviewers. It's weird how, at times, the author winkingly admits how cliched some of his characters or plot developments are, but seems to make no attempt to innovate. Mediocre writing with distracting cliches (two characters are described as laying together like \\"spoons in a drawer\\"). The book is doomed by the author's decision to frame most of it as a first-person flashback. Who wants to listen to someone tell a long, flattering, story about themselves for 600 pages? Why have a book that starts out with references to a supernatural invasion and ongoing civil war suddenly shift to a bunch of stuff with no apparent connection to those conflicts? It reads like an unnecessary prequel to a better book.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I know I was expecting a lot for the final book in the series, but this was a total let down. Happy about who Sookie ended with and glad to see some of the characters return, but it was a pathetic contrived story. Glad I still have the TV show to watch. For once I can say the show is better than the book.

There is something on this album for all types of Megadeth fans !
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have been waiting for this book and now I can't wait for book 4!<br /><br />I loved that Gideon was more open in this book. I will totally agree with some of the other reviews that Eva needs to say \\"good-bye\\" to Brett once and for all! And Corinne......that woman should've succeeded in the overdose because she has been on my last nerve since book 1. WHY does Gideon always go running to her?! I don't understand that! That would be a deal breaker for me over the good sex, engagement/marriage, all of it! If you love someone else so much, you don't go running to another woman for anything! Ever!<br /><br />Cary's storyline had me rolling my eyes. Don't like Tatiana, but I do like Trey. So now there's supposedly going to be a baby?! We'll see....maybe it's all a ploy from the devious b to keep him to herself.<br /><br />I can't help but feel that something big is coming. There's something we still haven't learned, so many secrets between Gideon's mom, now Eva's mom, why does Corinne have such a strong hold on Gideon, there's something more to the Anne Lucas story too. The Russian Mafia thing was unnecessary....really? My suspicions are on Gage (no one has met his girlfriend yet right?), Stanford's nephew (his name has left my mind)...interesting how he just keeps popping up. Now Megumi has gone MIA. I would almost bet that Clancy or Angus had something to do with framing someone else about Nathan's murder. Now there's a sex tape with Eva and Brett?! The video alone should've been enough for her to never speak to him again! Deanna needs to be bitch slapped and gone....especially after the charity dinner, when Eva came back to see her sitting there with Gideon! Um, no, she needs to be gone.<br /><br />I'm hoping we get some answers to these questions in book 4 and that we don't have to wait a year for the next one! I read this book in 3 days and need something else to kill the time until book 4 comes out!

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I really am enjoying this show and recommending it to others.  It has great sub-plots and arc stories as well. I like the characters but also it has a great group of actors that make this a great show to watch and the best part is that the whole family can watching and no swearing.<br /><br />All around great show, but I wish it was more than 4 seasons!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|It's heart breaking to read about this young men's life and how he managed to survive the only way he knew how. Even if that meant betraying his family for death. Hopefully more people will become aware of the horrific condition of north Korea and do something to save many people's lives in those horrific prison camps.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|I tell you what, if Helen Hunt isn't one of the best actresses of her time, I don't know who is. My wife and I both were blown away by this movie. The trailer doesn't do this movie any justice. While it has its moments of humor, it is all in the story as it unfolds. How does Fargo win an Academy Award while little jewels like this picture are never even considered.<br /><br />Yes, there is full nudity in the film! Yes, there are scenes of a very sexual nature. But that is what makes this movie. The movie could have easily been made without the nudity and scenes of very realistic sexual intimacy. But it would not have been the movie that it is.<br /><br />I have to applaud William Macy's role as well. He kept it real and grounded while adding a mixture of humor and his very own sense of awe and wonder as he met with Mark as a priest, but also as a cheerleader of sorts. How many would have imagined a priest, looking up at a figure of Jesus, and tell Mark that \\"God would give him a free pass\\" in his endeavor to experience physical sex and love, yes love.<br /><br />While the movie may not suitable for most children, it could be a valuable lesson to a child mature enough to understand, but with a parent to guide him/her through the real story being told.
B00023B1LC|4.0|To say that Jason Bourne is similar to James Bond is something of an understatement and a very underrated claim at the same time. I mean, they even have the same initials! Some might say that it is just being cliched to compare the two, but in my mind, it truly works. Where Bond is suave and impressionable, Bourne is direct and doesn't really care what people think of him. Of course they are similar, but if one keeps a cool head and doesn't get too critical, both franchises can be enjoyed without any trouble. The film definitely departs from the source material, but not to its discredit. The film manages to transcend the genre by taking the places and names from the books and create its own original story. It follows the baseline of the books, but crafts a world for our main character which is plausible and modern enough to not even appear dated. The performances are all top-notch; as it should be, the persona Damon creates as Bourne is by far the best role in the film. I would say its absolutely one of his best roles - what one would call a tour-de-force performance. However, ample support is supplied from the rest of the cast also. Potente is especially good, and even though Cooper just seems pissed off all the time, it really is a testament to his acting abilities if one watches his other movies and understands his immense range. Something that only just recently came to me about these films is the diversity of the cast. There is Bourne, who is a definite loner, even when he's with Marie. He can never get over the changes that his experiences have forced him to make, and he is therefore incredibly tortured by conflicting emotions and thoughts all the time. So no matter who he interacts with, the focus is always on Bourne. He functions in all situations the same, and deals with everybody (except Marie) more or less the same. He is what he is, and you either love him or hate him - no gray area. Then we have those who are tracking and/or trying to kill him, and theyhave their own separate part of the movie that only sometimes interacts with Bourne. Because of all this, everything is literally on Damon's shoulders to carry the movie, and that is why he is so great. Just like Bourne, Damon has to stand out. If he doesn't, then his role means nothing, and the viewer doesn't care about what happens. This is much like what happens in \\"Unknown\\", the fairly recent Liam Neeson vehicle, which has a very similar storyline to the Bourne films. The movie also fits in rather nicely with the other two, and creates a viable trilogy. One might say that they prefer Liman's directing simply due to the fact he doesn't use choppy editing like Greengrass did, but I understand the need for both methods in their element and could not imagine either one to be any different. As with all three of the Bourne films, the action is astonishingly simple once one gets used to it, and anyone is more than welcome to freeze-frame and follow the choreography. Some have said that the way these films compose the action sequences is unnecessarily fast and showy. I disagree. The films' choreography is a symbol for the character of Bourne. The action is literally so fast it's over before you even realize, much like it is from Bourne's side of things. Due to his amnesia, he doesn't understand what he's doing either, per se. It's a reflex for him to react the way he does. He just does it, without hesitation or remorse, which is exactly why he's so good as an agent. I will say that for me, the franchise's only disadvantage is for anyone who's never seen the films before. When I first watched the films, I didn't really understand it either. It was all too complicated for me at the time. But after watching all three of the Damon films (haven't seen Legacy yet) several times once I got older, I have progressively understood what is going on within each one. Once I understand what's going on, it's a piece of cake to invest myself in the story and characters. But for thosewho are beginners like I was at one time, the films probably seem horrible. That's when I would say to stick with them for the long haul - watch them all again, if you have to. I love these films, and I would strongly recommend them to anyone. Don't underestimate the awesomeness of Bourne.

B00BT0ZS52|1.0|Awful. I am typically easily entertained. Just looking for an hour and half of escape. Doesn't take much. I can't remember the last time that I could not make myself finish a movie. It happened with this one. I've never reviewed a movie before but I wanted to save you a few bucks and about 3 hours that you will never get back.<br />Awful. Just an awful movie
B003E8P9G0|3.0|I am a mid forties reader of kids adventure books.  I am a Percy Jackson fan and a 39 Clues fan.  As I was reading The Red Pyramid, it felt like a mash up of those two very successful series, but not as engaging as either of them.  My twelve year old son had the same reaction, and I could not get him to finish reading the book.  I finished the book, and found it to be decently enjoyable.  It did not compel me to read further on in the series though.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Mr. Buble continues to impress with all sorts of goodies in his recordings.  I am always amazed at the control and mastery of his selections on his recordings.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I was so happy to find this app.  There was a previous piano app that didn't quite cut it but this one is fantastic.  I have already spent more time than I should playing my 'portable piano'.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Shows you how battery is charged and how much time left. Great app with one click. Don't have to go to device to get info.
B009R659L8|5.0|I read all of her books and love them.  She never puts sex or swear words in them.  They just don't come out fast enough
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|Nice.  I could have used some more!  Mr. Anka is a very talented musician who is very capable of success in any style.
B0027Z9C2I|5.0|I keep looking at it to see the lyrics and try to learn from them. The plot is interesting and it is a great experience.
B0012C7ET0|5.0|UNLIKE THE GARTH BROOKS ALBUM WITH THE AMERICAN FLAG ON THE FRONT, WHERE SOME UNKNOWN SINGER SINGS GARTHS SONGS, THIS IS STEVIE NICKS ALBUM IS GREAT!  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF HER MUSIC!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I quickly learned that &#34;Hill Climb Racing&#34; is not racing but finesse handling and driving. The entry vehicle is a Jeep and has no difficult controls to manage - you have a brake and accelerator. But don't let the lack of controls fool you . . . have a heavy foot and you are back at the starting line. As you accumulate driving points you have the opportunity to add stability to your vehicle. Hill Climb Racing may be a simple game but it is addicting - Each time I start up my Kindle I find myself wanting to click on the Hill Climbing Icon. Unless you are an extreme gamer you will enjoy this game.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a very funny enjoyable read from the male POV. I haven't read many books like this from the guys POV so it's refreshing to find one.  What I really liked enjoyed was this book made me LAUGH and LAUGH out loud.  I found it very easy to get caught up in the story, the characters and the romance.<br /><br />The author writes well and I would definitely read her next book.<br /><br />If you want something funny to take on a trip or take you away for a few nights, read Tangled.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|One of the best movies to come out in the recent years; cast and story were fantastic. I'm glad to add this movie to my collection.
B001PO53IO|5.0|The droids are funny they sound funny and act funny. The first of five seasons you will want them all.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|It is very useful, very portable folding later.<br />Led me to take it every day in summer.<br />But why so heavy?
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I had been waiting for the next installment of the Crossfire series.  I found this book a very good read though it seemed a little slow at first.  It definitely picked up and doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />I did find some relationships still had a lot of unanswered questions so I can see where there is a definite need for another book and I was surprised by the ending as I thought it was the book of three.  Well, a 4th is something definitely worthy of waiting for.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Don't need an alarm that often.  Having fun trying to decide<br />on the face.  Partial to wordy and the hands.  Need the brain<br />in the family to see if I can get the digital off military time.  No<br />reading glasses needed.
B001GQSY64|5.0|may the force save baby jabba. this is excellent story about Anakin Skywalker and his new padawan Ahsoka Tano trying to rescue baby jabba.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is  a waiting game but it is very fun. It was a very good game to download. Cool  game
0425263924|1.0|I can only assume that the reason why Sylvia Day has extended the Crossfire series is because of the money! Not because there is a genuinely interesting story line or any substantive characters to build on.<br /><br />Conclusion: this 3rd book is terrible, terrible, and terrible!<br /><br />I'm finished with this...
B0053O89KG|5.0|What can I say, it's a toss-up between this Series & NCIS!  Love them both. Once you watch them, you're Hooked!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's my favorite game.My sister got it and I just had to down load it.I definitely give it a thumbs up!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|It is fun because it is intense and addicting. Now that is a awesome day. I love it so much
B00AV68GOA|4.0|This book is the screenplay for the series and it pretty much exactly follows the first season.  I enjoyed it as I believe that Downton Abby is the best Drama to come along in years.  If you are looking for more insight into the characters you will be dissapointed.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Surely one of the Better Series I've watched, and between my Daughter & Myself, We take turns buying the next one!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|downloaded this so I could put Mickey Mouse on for my daughter. it didn't work at all. got error messages on loading. uninstalled and reinstalled with no change.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a lot fun. Easy to play but challenging never get bored playing.  Love the new weekly hunts and boards. Only complaint is it freezes sometimes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is a game full of adventure and fun. This is a great game for everyone that likes challenging game. Subway Surfers has different themes which means even more FUN!!!
0786948523|4.0|As the title says, I like the 4e MM, however, I am one of those weirdos who reads a bunch of D&D books but never actually plays the game. I would much appreciate a good chunk of info with each listing of mobs regarding ecology, background, further info, etc.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Charlaine Harris, you should be ASHAMED of Yourself! What a load of Crap! The ending was drab and Totally Anti-climactic. It's like she just wanted to wrap everything up and be done with it. It was just plain lazy sloppy writing. I wish I had NEVER even started it!! So Disappointed!!! So VERY Disappointed!!!
0385349831|4.0|this book is written in a different style it was good and has a lot of good lessons, the first half of the book was intriguing and held my attention, the second half started to wonder and was started repeating the themes.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|A must-have for my video library and a fine and final tribute to the fabulous Michael Jackson, whose work and music will live forever.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVED this book! I can't believe it ended the way it did.  How long till the 4th book of this so called trilogy comes out?I
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Love this--it can be used in so many positions. I read in bed, whle on my exercise bike and don't need my hands.
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|I needed a long lightning cable to charge my iPhone and iPad during the night. I needed a longer cable because of the location of the electric sockets in my bedroom. This cable is superbly constructed. It is heavy and thick and the connection from the wire to the lightning Jack seems very very solid. I am very pleased with this purchase so far. I was so happy with this purchase, I purchased one for my office.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A wonderful movie -- I saw it in the theater and felt I just had to own it for future viewing.
B000QCTNIW|5.0|It has been a long held belief in science that brains wire during the formative years and then they pretty much stop changing. Phewie! The Brain that Changes Itself shows a number of case studies about dramatic ways our brains can change at least until we're 80 years old.... Nice!<br /><br />It is well written and accessible for the laypeson, too, since I don't happen to be a brain scientist.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|It caught me as few novels they have caught me.<br />The only one fault that I find is that it has too many characters and that, the nights in which I continued reading until evening it seemed to me that some names were lending to confusion as Mikael and Martin, that on having read rapidly, beginning both names with the letter M and having the same quantity of letters, I had to move back a couple of lines to give more attention to know if he was speaking about Mikael or about Martin.<br />I recommend it to all that they like that kind of tales.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I just happened to watch the movie because my brother told me I'd like it and I did.  What I really liked was the music as done by these people!  I didn't even know Tom Cruise could sing!
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I watched Upstairs /Downstairs after watching Downton Abby and so it was very easy to watch another family and thier<br />troubles.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Sounds nerdy but it is very addicting and I can't put it down!!! It stinks it needs internet though. I recommend it. Very easy to catch on to.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|my uncle recommended this game to me so I started playing it and I couldn't get off it!!! that's tow addicting it is to me!!! I need to thank my uncle for telling me about this game!!!
B00A81MV3U|3.0|It's okay, not what I expected for all the hype it got!<br />It was kind of disappointing!  Hope others liked it better than I did!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching all the episodes of \\"Suits\\"! I am totally hooked on Harvey and can't wait to find out who he will challenge next to be his gal. Love the show!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesomest app ever. Super addicting and a lot of fun. I wish it was updated like the Xbox and pc but still amazing.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This is an amazing movie.<br />Brand new<br />Even though it came a day late, but that doesn't matter because it was worth it. I love this movie :)
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|As I've said several times in this little box, I'm happy to click on the stars, I'm not interested in typing into this box.<br /><br />Please stop sending me annoying emails expecting me to do this. Or change your rules so I can just click on 1 or more stars and go back to what I was doing, which is ALWAYS much more important than wasting my time typing stuff into this box.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book. I can't wait for what is coming next! Sylvia Day keep it coming... I need more Gideon in my life!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season three is chock full of drama, emotions and surprises. I hate spoilers so I won't ruin one delicious moment except to say this season, in particular, tore out my heart and stomped on it.  I loved every minute.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|Product broke within 2 days of use.  Don't buy this product.  It is cheaply made and poor quality.  You are wasting money.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal is, suprinsingly good. Tumblr convinced me to take a look at the show and, the moment Mads Mikkelsen appeared on screen, I was hooked. Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen make the perfect Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter, respectively.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|a very funny game, and i can play it for free! thanks developer and amazon app store. Why can i just give rate without leaving comment?
0345803507|5.0|This series of books kept my interest. I would finish one and couldn't wait to read the next! It is a must read!
B0083Z614S|5.0|When I was younger this was my favorite, and being nearly grown it is still among my favorites. The focus shifts from the main character, Mary, to a young man who you severely love. You want him to achieve his wildest dreams and see him and Mary succeed with everything they do. This book brings out the best in you. Stunningly beautiful with its awesome imagery, I'll say anyone can enjoy this, be it a small child or a stressed out adult. I hope if you're reading this I've convinced you to read this, because in no way is this a regretable decision
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Facebook used to be real good and fun. It sure isn't now! They makes changes THEY want and with no prior warning!! We don't get any say-so or a chance to choose or anything!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app ever &middot; It is so fun I can never stop playing it&middot; Although  it is so much money just for a app
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great way to unwind after a long day. Puzzle are fun and challenging. What more is there to say. Thanks
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Good quality and super fast shipping! I am very satisfied with the product. I love the show and recommend it to all zombie movie fans.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The journey of Eva and Gideon just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait for the next installment. Hopefully the wait won't be too long!!!!!
B00A4AI17A|5.0|If you love Verdi you should get this set. It contains some of the best recordings ever including some real epoch making gems such as Aida with Nilssen/Corelli/Mehta, Otello with Vickers/Freni/Karajan or La Traviata with Scotto/Kraus/Bruson. The set tends to emphasize recordings with Domingo and Muti with are also great. I am very happy with this collection and I highly recommend it.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I started to dislike eva in book 2. I already thought she was selfish in book 1 , but allowed for that fact because of her mum, childhood etc.All the stuff with brett in book 2 was really annoying me , especially the kiss. Book 3 set my blood boiling . I had to stop reading it and get myself together .  Now I really dislike Eva, she does not deserve Gideon, and Im wondering what kind of friend she is to Cary. I would have thought she would have told him everything no matter what . Next door !!!!! please !!I dont think I want to SUFFER through books 4 & 5 , so I'll give them a miss. Hated the stupid ending.<br />Love Sylvia Day as an author.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It's a great game but I wish I could plants in stock otherwise it's pretty good game that's the only bad thing about the game
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Great series - once you start watching you can't stop and end up wanting more. Bought the series . A must have
0066620996|4.0|Good to Great was written by Jim Collins as a follow-up of Built to Last. In the Good to Great, Collins explored the essential that a company needs to become a great company and sustain the greatness. Collins described in details some distinctions that the great company owns, such as the existence of level 5 leaders, having the right people, hedgehog concept, and having a culture of discipline. Collins mentioned that all level 5 leaders shared something in common, which is the combination of humility and will. They were also ferocious, determined, fanatically driven. One big concept in this book that caught my attention was the hedgehog concept. Collins explained that a company should focus on only ONE thing that they believe they can best at, they are passionate about, and also drives their economic engine. I think it's interesting how we can also apply that concept to each individual. People should figure out what they like and they are good at before they decide what they want to do. When our idea are scattered, we can reach the ultimate goal smoothly. This book is not only good for managers, supervisors, or CEOs of company but also for anybody who wants to learn what it takes to be a great leader. I recommend this book highly!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so muck I just build what my imagination tells me Im making a sever for this game ounce the update on kindle comes out
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really like this game but it really does not update so that means I don't get milk or cake eggs and bucket to craft as much thing so I got really mad ,but on my brother nexus his updated but it is a fun game but I wish it would update.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After months of waiting this is what is released This book reaked of money grubbing. The story was not there and I should have listened to my gut and not finished. I don't usually scan through pages in a book but this one I did. More than once!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Captures you from the first page.  I didn't put it down until I finished it. Teen story but reading for anyone.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watch it! Great acting and character development. Chicks are hot too. Makes me wish I was able to go to Harvard and become an attorney.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I read some pretty bad reviews of this last book in the series but I liked how the writer wrapped things up. Some times you need to just take things as they are and I was satisfied with this ending.
B00005RIKI|5.0|instant download, fast shipping of cd. This will always be the greatest rock band of all time. Little brother is the perfect voice for the one we all loved.
0446693804|5.0|I've loved every book that Nicholas Sparks has written and this one is definitely on my list of top favorite books by him. It makes you think about your own life and the things that we can take for granted and as most of his books was quite the tear jerker.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love that they made a pocket edition of minecraft. The best game I have played by far. My only complaint is that it takes amazon forever to get the updates in the app store. Other than that amazing!!!!!
B007REV4T8|1.0|This film was bad.  Who are these people giving this movie 5 stars?  They certainly aren't Bond aficionados.  Bond films have a familiar and much-loved pattern that gives them their cult following.  We know we will see a handsome, debonair James Bond along with clever gadgets, clever dialogue, fast cars and fast-paced plots set to the great original music accompanied by beautiful Bond girls. This film had none of these.<br /><br />I have loved all the Bond actors...however,not so much the Roger Moore films because they made him foolish.  I even liked Daniel Craig at first, but his last two films were sadly lacking.  Who writes these movies?  A bunch of 7th Graders?  Why wreck the wonderful character of James Bond?  Invent a new character and make him say and do stupid things.<br /><br />Hollywood isn't very good at coming up with anything original...everything is a re-make.  Take someone else's good idea and ruin it with poor writing, casting and directing so you can say you made a movie.<br />I keep hoping that the next installment will bring us back to the authentic James Bond...but I'm beginning to worry...I think it might be too late.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It doesn't update on the day of the update for the Kindle.<br />But it is the best survival game out there. It was worth every penny of that<br />seven bucks. Arrow 2001 from YouTube. Expect glitches.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds is just entertaining and challenging enough to keep your mind and attention occupied. Hard to put down after you've started playing it.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|Don't think your gonna hear Steve Morse kill it,but this album works good as a whole album,and the Purple rythem section just slays,fun album to put on in the car and just let it play.
1781162646|5.0|I'm not going to do a plot synopsis or give anything away and I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying this is a very sad<br />and melancholy reading experience. The publisher pretty much admits this on the back cover of the book anyway.  While I read<br />each King book and often times read them over and over again, I doubt this is one I will ever return to because I found it to<br />be simply too sad for my taste.  Again, I'm not giving anything away here, the book is sad from the start and never truly escapes<br />that mood although there are a few bittersweet fun moments in this novel.  I'm glad I read it and thought it was a very good book<br />but I don't think I want to feel the way I felt while reading this book again.  Very well written and an intriguing story, but<br />too sad for me and perhaps others.  Sure lots of King books have been sad but this one really sort of hit me over the head and made<br />me cry (which of course says something about what an excellent writer King is).  Just don't want to do it again.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I don't watch much television, but this series has been wonderful.  The characters are complex and the story lines are always interesting with surprises.  How did the writers know my first mother-in-law?????  I love the story lines around the children as well as the legal cases.  The acting is terrific.  I can hardly wait for the next season.
1883217040|5.0|I bought this book which was chosen by a member of my family who is studying Jazz, and he loved it!
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|First off i like the fact they changed the name,it has the Thin Lizzy vibe plus Scott is always great to hear on the guitar,really good band and they kind of have their own vibe as well,if you like Lizzy and have an open mind it is great.
B00CO8D3G4|1.0|Another US-oriented inspirational reading for US-born, well-to-do people with extended safety net or personal charisma who can successfully and repeatedly raise capital to become successful entrepreneur, after a lot of failures, raising money again and again.<br /><br />For those with no money, no safety net, for whom fundraising don't work, or located in other countries with different laws, it's no more than entertaining reading to flex your analytical thinking muscle.<br /><br />The book is a mix of healthy way of life, New Age beliefs of attracting prosperity to your life, and \\"yes, you can! just believe\\" type of books. In a cruder way (jargon). By the way, you will need to search the web for \\"how to\\", and proper terms to use will be \\"bowel cleansing\\" and \\"liver cleansing\\".<br /><br />Similar, but stronger books that come in mind are: [[ASIN:B009P4MH26 Think and Grow Rich: The Original 1937 Unedited Edition]], [[ASIN:1439167346 How To Win Friends and Influence People]], more than decade old seminars of Donald Trump, and any of New Age books on The Law of Attraction (for example, [[ASIN:B00642W5JM Attract Abundance Now: with EFT and the Law of Attraction Volume 1]]).<br /><br />You have nothing to loose at this price ($5), but don't expect something new, apart from flashing names and spent millions in your face, a lot of this, though.<br /><br />No, I'm don't need a refund, which author offers, thanks.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|When I downloaded this game, I was surprised to see it was really fun. However, I couldn't find a way to exit the program other than forcing it to close.  Therefore,  I give it a mix result.

0714834491|5.0|I like this book. Either by reading or just browsing through it and looking at the numerous pictures and drawings.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Brand new just as described in the description!  My boyfriend has all the previous 007 and wanted to keep his collection up to date!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ THIS YEAR!  Emotionally riveting!  I have recommended this book to friends and my family.
B005544V6A|5.0|Yep-Smart Alecs earning a living doing what they can do very well.  Good show. Entertaining and well written. Definitely not boring. So, I gave it 5 stars cause I like to see smart guys try to outsmart each other. And besides that, they are cute.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  From the first page to the last, it doesn't disappoint.  I ordered the second book when I was half way through this one!
1400052181|2.0|I was anticipating New Yorker level writing;  I got something closer to People.<br />Waaaaay too much about Rebecca Skloot in this book.  (Might have been more accurately titled the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks and Rebecca Skloot.)<br />Also waaay too much repetitive writing about the offspring of Henrietta Lacks.<br />At the end of the book, there's a bunch of filler including something titled \\"Case of Characters\\".<br />Very disappointing.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is really a great game. I haven't had any problems at all on my Kindle Fire. Even the sounds and music are entertaining. There is no timer which really adds to the relaxing game play. Most games of this type have some kind of timer in them that always lowers your score if u don't solve the level in a certain amount of time. This one doesn't which I think is wonderful!<br /><br />This game is very entertaining sand can be played by almost any age level. The graphics are well done for what the characters are - blobs of pudding and furniture that the pudding bounces off of. Great fun, and even some learning for the little ones as some of these puzzles require a lot of thought.<br />My only complaint ---<br />If one simply can't solve the level then the game will allow the player to purchase the answer. That's just wrong. Come on developers what's up with that??? That is why I only gave it 4. stars. I seriously considered giving only 3 stars because of that.  But this game is really entertaining and I haven't reached my frustration level so I gave it 4 even tho I think its VERY awful to charge for the game AND charge for the answers.  That's just down right GREEDY &amp; WRONG!!<br /><br />Overall this game would be 5 stars if the devs weren't so greedy about it. Other than that its a great game and I def recommend it. Def worth the 99&cent;. Thanks!
B0085TJUGI|5.0|This is a beautiful account of a divine healing after a miraculous near death experience. Anita's story touched me deeply and helped me to see how love is vital to our lives and how fear, if we let it, can wreak devastating effects.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Definitely a must see for anybody comtemplating the afterlife.No little accidents for me after this movie-lol<br />a must for any collection.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Has been in use for several years and no problem look for it to last as long as the TV or longer perhaps.

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Love the action in this game.  I don't usually play this type of game.  Its fast and fun.  I'm. Still getting the hang of it.
0143143492|5.0|Very well written and explains everything you ever wondered about the universe. Very amazing thing is that it actually improves your life when you apply the message of the value of being present. In future years this book will be right up there with the Bible as a Divine Source of knowledge. I''m sure we will get there some day.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|fast paced action movie, bought it on my kindle to watch on a plane and it kept my attention which I cant say for most of the movies that have been coming out lately.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friends iPod has the update but my kindle does not have it. Can you UPDATE it Mojhang.I have bean waiting so long for the update.
0307352153|4.0|If it were possible, I'd give 'Quiet' 4.5 stars. My book group just read this, and it led to an especially lively discussion. Validating for the more introverted among us, and thought provoking for everyone along the spectrum. It's certainly helpful on a personal level, to help better understand yourself and the people you love and live with, but also applicable to education, the workplace, and elsewhere. The author brings a strong body of research while also bringing great humanity to the topic. Whether you identify yourself as more of introvert, an extrovert, or somewhere in the middle, you'll find a lot of value in this book.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Very positive and uplifting book. I wasn't sure I really needed to read such subject matter, but after seeing the woman speak on PBS, I was curious. Highly recommended for anyone alive and aware they will deal with this some day. Very loving and positive message.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|warm bodies is a really cute spin on the normal zombie franchise!<br />I found it very enjoyable and made you really root for \\"r\\", and his buddy zombies.<br />I will share this movie with my whole family.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It is a work with a great balance of history and personal stories.  Ken Follett does it again!  Can't wait for the next book.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This was not as good as the other two by Khaled Hosseini. It starts out with a heartbreaking story of a brother and sister torn apart from each other and just wanders. The chapter on Markos could have been its own book and didn't have much to do with the rest of the book. After reading the Kite Runner and A Thousand Spendid Suns I was hoping for at least a little bit of a happy ending but this was very sad still. Overall, I would recommend it because his writing is so great but don't expect to be enthralled like the other two novels he's written.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Awesome good looking movie came in a good condition feels good i love the movie is worth buying to enjoy such an awesome movie
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|A fantastic film that is packed with action.  007 is faced with a few new circumstances we have rarely seen him in and we are reintroduced to the series as new actors take on the characters we have come to know and love.  A great film.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Cohen is not a fool.  He has riddled his movies with hypocritical insights of the caucasian and middle eastern varieties.  The one common theme and quite possibly what he draws his most humor from throughout the entire movie is the second class position of women in modern society regardless of nationality.  His intentions are not completely virtuous.  He pushes the limits of sexual exploitation to commit his humor and his theme to one's memory.  I found myself rolling my eyes at his story telling quite as frequently as chuckling at his humor.<br /><br />Note: there is something in this movie to offend everyone, hence the R rating.
B001KT6JPA|1.0|I couldn't even finish this thing.  I guess Anthony Hopkins had a contract to complete.  Otherwise, why would he do this?  Jody Foster was luckier.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|It is a little smaller than I expected. But it's comfortable and excellent quality. Very portable and good design. :)
B007EECSFA|5.0|Several of us were reading at the same time.  I pride myself on being able to figure out how a book ends.  This was surprised me and I can't help thinking about it.  I feel like I have to read the book a second time now that I know the ending.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|now i can see what i recorded almost in real time. as a skydiver a can tell u that this item is a wonderfull tool to be used specially when u are sharing magical moments upthere
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I like this cover / holder. It works just like it said it would  The  stand works great even on your lap.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|I like the game except when you die, YOU DIE. You have to go back to the very beginning of the game. Which I think is weird because there is check points in the game. So why don't you start again there?? It's also really slow, it's like hey I want to get this coin, it's right in front of me, I'll take 5 minutes to get there at top speed!! Honestly, it's very frustrating.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|love it- it's a replacement for an 8 track we had in high school!  Nice to have the tunes back.
0062082353|3.0|must read it. it's a very interesting product for knowing more about what happens behind real action special commandos life. i really suggest to get it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A graceful, simple and a powerhouse of a book! Loved it. I don't know if can sit through a theatrical version of this book. With all their magic they won' t come close to capturing its life. I know anyone who reads this will be disappointed in the movie. So pick your poison because you won't get both.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is seriously addicting.<br /><br />PROS.  :D<br />.cool graphics<br />.cute characters<br />.super addicting<br />.reminds me of my little pony!<br /><br />CONS.  D;<br />.super addicting<br />.the classic &quot;joystick&quot; is a little hard to move
B008S0IJAM|4.0|I am a big Aimee Mann fan.  This album maintains her high standards for songwriting and melody, but nothing hear truly soars like the best songs of her earlier CDs.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Unique take on all the zombie stories. It had a little more of a human element to it. I highly recommend it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|really like it - but dictionary has to be purchased separately<br />  some ebooks are too expensive and can buy the book cheaper
B000FA675C|5.0|I found this to be a really great book, it was full of intrigue and really made me think what if...
B00CS65JS2|5.0|When I first heard this CD, it reminded me of the classic 70s albums that cohered together around a theme, yet the music is so now.  I  know that it is about a robot becoming a human, but it also totally works if seen from the perspective of a person trying to feel/live again.  As far as the music goes, it as creative as any CD this year.  As far as the highlights go, Touch is the best song of the year.  Bravo to Daft Punk for so profoundly transcending the dance genre in which they have been pigeonholed!
B0094M2SCI|5.0|There is nothing else to say about this movie. a true modern classic vampire werewolf film. Kate is smokin' hot!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|fell asleep halfway thru<br />the whole daddy/ son thing was done with Spielbergs' War of the Worlds to ad nauseum<br />Enough already !
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are fun and a good balance between easy and hard, but others aren't as fun and either too easy or too hard.
B008Y768XO|4.0|This story was so touching; it had me crying historically. I haven't cried like that since I was a child watching Old Teller.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|I never saw another presentation of this opera, so I have no parameters for comparison, but I love  Jonas Kaufamn and I believe that his interpretation of the aria &#34;Pourquoi me r&eacute;veiller&#34;  is one of the best in the world. So it is worth buying the dvd.
030789701X|4.0|I have a 14 minute video review and unboxing uploaded on my YouTube Channel. You are more than welcome to watch it. Channel is NiZZULiVE (NIZZU).<br /><br />Taken from my review.<br />\\"The map has the same (high-gloss) finish that the poster does. The one thing I don't like about this finish is all the fingerprints. Especially when the background is black, you can basically see everything. I wish they would start giving these maps (referring to most guide books) a matte finish or print them on a higher quality paper.\\"<br /><br />\\"The only guide book you need for Skyrim. I cannot complain about the content of the guide book at all. It's the most comprehensive and exhaustive guide out for the game at the moment and might even be the last.<br />My only complaint is about the cover. I know they were probably trying to keep cost down given the size of this book but I wish it had a better cover. A leather cover perhaps, or a cloth cover? Some embossment would have been nice. Maybe they could have issued two versions of this guide in the same fashion as the original game guide? A paperback would have been too difficult... maybe this hardcover and the choice of a more elaborate and expensive cover? To be honest, this cover feels and looks like some of my cheaper game guides and it's hard to say, just by looking at it, how long it would hold up under normal use.\\"
0439882826|5.0|After seeing an exhibit of Reinhart and Sabuda pop-up books, I was hooked.  I decided this would be the perfect birthday present for a Star Wars fan.  Neither  of us were disappointed.  Totally awesome book.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Songs are sexy, fun, and meaningful. Great album! Great for summer! Even better than last one. More mature and you can tell he was in love when he made this.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I love my cloud drive. I resisted one for years, but knowing things are safe and away from hardware, that can crash is a great relief!
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Daft Punk plus Pharrell equals smoking hot dance track. This track makes you wanna move. Can't wait to get the rest of this album!
B005544TRQ|4.0|It was a fun and enjoyable show. Easy to watch and listen to. The characters are interesting and it makes you want to know more about them and how they will interact with each other. Can't wait for next season
B00004WNFZ|5.0|This is a great vinyl for any collector!  Great album filled with a great variety of songs!  My favorite album from Portishead!
B00000DQWT|5.0|Enjoyed the music as much as the movie.  Music was actually better than the movie. Worth the purchase of the CD.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Having just come off finishing up all the seasons of Rescue Me, I was sure there couldn't possibly be any more testosterone left in the universe. I was wrong! The Shield, season one, makes Rescue Me look like a bunch of outgrown college boys making jokes around a stolen frat-house keg. I'll be honest; I almost didn't make it through The Shield's first season. The characters seemed one-dimensional and I felt like I didn't really care about them at all--I was at that point in serial-viewing where I cut my losses and move on, or I bite the bullet (pun intended) and stay with it. Metal has a tangy taste! Near the end of season one, I felt the urge (not necessarily the addiction) to continue. The story lines become more complex, and the characters have ALL experienced issues or events that have made them evolve. I'm a middle-aged female college professor, so I need more than &#34;mere&#34; ethical dilemmas and a couple of fancy guns to keep me watching. The Shield brings with it smart writing, talented casting, and edgy filming techniques. I'm nearing the end of Season 3 and it just keeps getting better!
B00456H5LC|5.0|This CD fits a lot of tastes and is just a good thing to have around when you're about to have... \\"adult time\\".
B000N2HCM4|1.0|This book is mostly fictional. The events he potrays in this book are mostlyfabricated or ideas or expierences from someone else. Writing is another thing he has no business doing!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Are you kidding me?  Love that we have been sucked into another book.  Keep them coming, but faster please. Awesome read but now have to wait.  Ugh
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great follow-up to Bared To Me, so in love with the story & how no matter what he loves her.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its really cool. you've got the survival mode, and creative mode. you've got the awesome crafting recipies and BUDDER!!!! ha, and you have mobs like zombie pigmen, spiders, the origanal creeper, and zombies and skeleton. some people think and ask, why is it not like the full version? well, for one thing, the price is too low. well, why wont they just higher the price? well, then it will be too much. the full version is 26 bucks. Nd that's too much for an app store. and another reason itsnot like the full version is that if you own the full version on the computer, you know that you have to download different packs in order to play other peoples games they made. witch will increase the milibyts or gigabytes used on the game.if it gets to be more than the device can hold, then it might completely erase the app,or even apps. that's why its probably the best app in the app store.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|this is a terrible movie. I believe it is movies like this that is destoying this country.Mr. Moore is very capitalistic in his large home and body guards.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Loved Pillars of the Earth, but this is really more of my genre. Would have given it five stars, if the bad guy won. Will eventually read all of Follett's books in this genre.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I had already purchased Avatar but jumped at the chance to buy this package.<br />Seeing it in the theater in 3D made this my first Blu-ray DVD purchase.<br />Gave my regular DVD to a friend for their birthday. I hadn't opened it yet.<br />Excellent movie with several meanings to think about.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|Lazy last novel, Sooky easily escaped every ordeal with which she was faced.  Too many holes in the plots etc etc, glad it's over !
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book!  Just when you think you have it figured out the author throws in a twist.  Great attention to detail an enjoyable read.
0316044407|1.0|Me, being an aspiring writer of these type of books, wanted so bad to love this book!!!!<br /><br />I LOVED the movie!!!  I am so freaked out by pedifiles and wanting to get all of them off<br />the streets.<br /><br />When I first started reading it I was so confused by how everything was worded and then<br />to find out that in the book she said they found her &#34;elbow&#34;... seems unbelievable, an elbow?<br />That's made up of several bones - like the end of the ulna or radius, right?<br /><br />I feel bad about not liking this book and I think Alice Sebold is awesome, it's just for me, it was shoddy<br />and all over the place.  And at least she has the guts to get her book published- unlike me, I am so<br />critical on myself I can't finish one adult novel!! (have 3 childrens books written but zero adult ones).<br /><br />Maybe I should just write and not care about it being perfect and see if others like it, what the heck, if<br />this was made into an awesome movie!  You did something right Alice :0)
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I have not read the fourth book of the series yet, but this one is excellent! Paolini's writing matured so much with this one. Love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I usually pick my books based on the reviews that people have made on them. This book is no exception.  It is well written and hard to put down.  If you are looking for a detailed review it shouldn't be hard to find. I recommend this book and I am excited to read the next one!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is a fun game! I have tried an tried to slip one past him but he guesses everyone. It's a great game!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I am an aspiring writer. I have a few childrens books written but after submitting my first one<br />and getting rejections I kind of stashed them away and forgot about them.<br /><br />I am in the process of getting myself prepped to write some adult novels and was really<br />curious as to Stephen King's inspirations and background is all about and I have been<br />pleasantly surprised by it! It is quite funny reading about his life and what made him think<br />about when he was inspired by Carrie.<br /><br />I feel like I am reading about myself when he talks about &#34;peeling his rubber suit off&#34;, etc.<br /><br />Stephen, if you are reading this review, I have a lot of great ideas for books for you!!!!!<br /><br />Call me !!! :0)
0425263924|5.0|I love this series.  I can't wait for the next two books.  I highly recommend all the books. HOT READS
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I was wary of a new Muppet movie after &#34;Muppets from Space,&#34; but this movie hearkens back to the older movies.  It's full of charm, humor, and awkward transitions!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Loved the story it was well written but I was hoping it would be a little longer but I still enjoyed it
0792846443|5.0|We have a nice sized DVD library with a lot of scary movies but when my husband reminded me<br />of this one I was surprised we didn't have it!<br /><br />I purchased it here on Amazon and we watched it. It is one of those really good movies that<br />everyone should have in their cabinet. A good one to watch every once in a while. One of my<br />fave Stephen King movies for sure.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Hope they don't cancel it - it is the only good show on TV and so scary!  Definitely my must watch!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I loved this book and it's silly notations to robbers and pirates and I loved It's interesting turn and twists. Great book I recommend this book to everyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh my goodness!!! I have to wait for another another book??? I am so involved with the story of Eva and Gideon that waiting for more of their story has me in a tangled mess!!!  Thank you Sylvia Day for bringing this fantastic story of soul mates and lovers to life!
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Live or recorded, it's all Stevie and great music.  The live version is some of best concert material ever produced by Stevie and Double Trouble!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't understand why it is taking so long for Amazon to push the update out. I can wait for it, but I guess this is why I got it for $3.99? 4 stars for the game(PC version is 5 stars), but Amazon's dropped the ball, it's odd because they have always been exemplary in every other service since I joined in the late 90's.<br /><br />Here's hoping it comes soon, back to the PC, but I would like to play on my phone when I can't be at the computer.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Got as the free app of the day and would spend money to get it again.  It's fun to try and stump the Genie, I'm amazed that it can guess some &#34;off the wall&#34; characters.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Two authors, fifteen books, an ending that makes sense.  What more could you want? When is the sequel, &#34;The Wheel of Time Continues to Turn&#34;?
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I don't know but I think the story is really good.  Robin had to come from somewhere with a history.  This give you the early years and the latter both.  Great Movie
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This album has a slightly darker sound to it, but still classic Queens of the Stone Age feel. Dave Grohl's drumming is awesome.
B005V2S7FW|1.0|The idea of linking this app with my other devices is appealing. However, while the pc version is free, the android version requires a subscription fee. Call me cheap, but I call the tactic deceiving.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This was the best fiction I have read since Lord of the Rings! Absolutely spellbinding, addictive, and you are able to immerse yourself in it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't like this one so much. It took to long to build up to the point. The thing with the father coming to the house. Just not my way to a end
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is entertaining for children of all ages.My kids get excited when they are able to upgrade and get new characters when the theme changes. The theme changes every month. It is good for traveling and takes know internet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Traditional, true, but always enjoyable, can't miss entertainment.  In a waiting room or an easy chair this GAME is always a friend to come back to.  Have always loved it, always will.
B00005AAFS|1.0|It is good these beasts \\"sing\\" (better mutter, hiss, growl, grunt) in German, and I do not know German. The music is boring, repetitive, crass, crude, and lewd. I do not want to know what they are saying. What they are playing is vile and vicious enough.<br /><br />I was given a full refund for this. That is good. No more Rammstein--ever.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I am just learning my Kindle and I have no idea if this is even what I need or want as again I am learning
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This documentary keeps you informed about where our food comes from and how it's handled. I will show this to my whole family because this documentary can literally save your life!
B004GYY714|5.0|Good music and easy to find music off all types. No matter what style of music, you will<br />find it on Tunein Radio.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Why would you send a free video of a Blu-ray I just ordered?  I have no use for this video! If you wish to give me a free video, why not send me one that I don't have on disk? THANKS FOR NOTHING.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I loved this game, but passed all the levels and now wish I could add more to my game.<br />Great fun!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I'm 11 and I think it is so addicting. I don't know about you but do you enjoy it as much as me!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game that keeps the kids entertained and actually playing nice together ;) amazon really does need to be more on the ball with updates though because my kids that play on my kindle cannot play with their siblings on the iPods. Even the android app store has the update. :-) Things like this make amazon/ kindle seem like a poor choice at this stage, compared to other tablets, especially since you are stuck on the amazon app store when you have a Kindle.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Many, many twists and turns. Many characters introduced, mostly with any real purpose. This book and the one before could easily have been combined and edited down to be shorter than either individual book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a fun game that I enjoy playing and can easily pass playing with two different colors, but the kids can have fun with just one.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great way to pass some time i have always loved hidden object games i really like it i like that there is a story line to it
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this movie ,It's a great movie, I found it at a great price,delivery was great.I would buy again using this service
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Simple but challenging.Great for family or friends night. It is a quick but addictive game. We always seem to play &#34;just one more&#34;!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing solitaire on my Kindle and phone.  it is a fun game and it moves quickly<br />and is fun.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I could not put this novel down; a bit disappointed but only because I did not wan it to end!  You`'re such a TEASE Sylvia; I cannot wait for the next novel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You  should get this  game because it has 4 persons you can play as and has some new things jump over. IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!:)
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod outdid himself this time finally new songs from him not singing other people's songs. My wife and I have been fans since the 70s. He only gets better with age
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is not just for children. In fact, most kids won't enjoy it as much as adults because of the subtle references to American pop culture of the last 30 years.  But you get all of the nostalgia of the 1980's, with all of today's awesome graphics and smooth control interfaces.<br /><br />On the surface, the game looks very similar to Mario Brothers.  True, it has buttons instead of coins, but the teleport tubes are there, and it even has mushrooms.  As you play, you'll be reminded of Calvin and Hobbes (monsters), Bomber Man (another foe), Donkey Kong (the movement, playing field and controls) and many other old-school cultural and video games.  I like it better than Mario, though, because there aren't as many levels, and it won't take me months to get to the end of the game.<br /><br />The first level includes tutorial screens.  Be sure to take the time to read the screens as they pop up so you can learn how to use the controls and gain useful tips.  If you don't want to read them, you can jump over them. If you find the three paperclips hidden in each level, you get a bonus.  That's very practical for a paper world! LOL<br /><br />From the main menu, there is a little dressing room where you can change outfits.  It's always nice to be able to change your clothes to suit the day's planned activities (or your mood), isn't it?<br /><br />Games offered by Amazon Digital Services, Inc. tend to include wonderful graphics tinged with humor, and \\"Paper Monsters\\" is no exception.  There are so many great things about the game.  You control the game by holding your device in your hands, and using your thumbs to create action.  The interface is very responsive to touch.  The worse thing I can say about this game is that the music is a little annoying because it is repetitive.  Since the music can be muted, that is really a non-issue.<br /><br />This Free App of the Day (FAOTD) is truly a treasure in what can sometimes be a junk pile of FAsOTD.  If it's free download it, get it now and explore it later.  You will be glad you've added it to your library.  If it's not free, then this is one of those rare games worth paying for.<br /><br />Who knew that paperwork could be so much fun?<br /><br />Extremely highly recommended!get it now and explore it later.  You will be glad you've added it to your library.  If it's not free, then this is one of those rare games worth paying for.<br /><br />Who knew that paperwork could be so much fun?<br /><br />Extremely highly recommended!
B00992CF6W|4.0|When I was trying to update to 0&middot;7&middot;0. Alpha it would not let me get yet it  is a good app if you have kindle fire you might get frustrated you should get it.
B000068CNX|5.0|Its friends. got it for my son who has now discovered the series. loves it<br />Watches over and over again
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is good to play while watching TV and passing time during commercials.  It can become addictive though because I kept trying to figure out how to bounce the balls off the sides in order to pop bubbles that were blocked.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is a pretty cool little app. I would love to get a bigger Kindle just to be able to have more keyboard to work with.
0425263924|5.0|It took me but a day to read it. I could not put it down once I got it. I can't wait for the next one to come out, but I know I wont preorder it as it takes to long to get to me. i will go buy it  in store so I can read it sooner.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Perfect game, but an update to v0.7.0 would be nice on Kindle Fire as well. Don't forget about your customers here!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft the only thing is the updates are almost always late. the apple divices always get the update before us and its not fair.
B00AG297GK|4.0|Completely inappropriate humor............but very funny.  Watch it but never tell anyone that you liked it.<br />Not for small children or mature adults......just a guilty pleasure.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|The graphics are OK but I can't see my tracer bullets too clearly to see what or IF I'm hitting target but again its a free app.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So happy I finally got to read the next installment of the Crossfire series! Sylvia Day rocked this book! I absolutely loved it. A lot of people are upset that it ended on a cliffhanger, but I am much happier that it is 5 books instead of 3. I hate when a love story is rushed just so it can be wrapped up in the 3rd book. I feel like Gideon and Eva have a lot of demons, and that can't just be wrapped up in 3 books. So looking forward for Book 4!!!:)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|awesome app would like to see back function work better for kindle fire.put the word out thanks still need a few more words ok then bye
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I read this series with a friend and I am so sorry I did! I didn't like the first book, the second was much better and it gave me hope for the third. Disappointed is not strong enough to convey my feelings. I agree with another reviewer in the fact that it read like a bad porn. The dialog was, at best, like a teenager trying to talk dirty and erotic. Horrible! Ms Day needs a thesaurus! As for the next book, I'm done! I will not waste another penny on this series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun to play because you can build what ever you want and do what ever you want. This game is addictive and hard to stop playing!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A very addicting game. I can't play it enough. Probably the best free game I've played in ages.Try it and I think you will like it.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|It's cute and fun. Levels aren't terribly challenging. One or two take a couple tries, but still engrossing.<br />La la la.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Every song these ladies sing is perfection.  I would also like to credit the highly talented people in the background that work equally hard in turning out this CD.  I listen to it over and over.  Most the music in America cannot compare with songs on this CD.  Give it a listen and you’ll see what I am talking about.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Usually I get the free version before going to a paid app, but since this was an app that I knew I would be using a lot, I decided to jump in with 2 feet &amp; bypass the free version.<br /><br />As reluctant as I was to pay $4.99, it was definitely $ well spent.  The only thing that I wish it had in the recurring appointments screen was a setting for a specific date on the list.  (Ex.  Yearly, every 4th Thursday.  I couldn't get some of my holidays to repeat for this very reason.  Thanksgiving was only 1 of the days.)<br /><br />Excellent app, very easy to use.

B0025WX2YW|5.0|GREAT SERIES!  WE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT AND HATED TO SEE IT END. I WISH THERE WERE A SERIES THAT WOULD PICK UP FOLLOWING THE FINALE AND TAKE IT FURTHER.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|A disappointing end to a great series. I feel Ms Harris took the easy way out to end a very complicated story.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So hooked. I blew through all of the books in a couple of weeks. Can't wait for the next book. The waiting is the hardest part.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Been a fan of Qotsa since 1st album. Actually been a fan of Josh's guitar playing in Kyuss before he created Queens. Back then one of the first songs from Queens was Born to Hula on a Mans ruin album split with Kyuss.<br />The sound was fresh, exciting and different.<br />Like Clockwork does the same. I like the group of musicians on this album. The album feels dark. But the other songs balance it out like \\" I sat by the ocean\\" great song. Slide guitar is brilliant. Buy it you'll like it.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|this was a good flick. entertaining, easy to follow, and well thought out. Another winner for my boy Cruise. When I watch this, it almost feels like the Tom Cruise that I love from Top Gun, and Days of Thunder; not the later slightly creepier roles he did. This is a good American classic. God bless America
B000FCKGPC|5.0|So hooked. I blew through all of the books in a couple of weeks. Can't wait for the next book. The waiting is the hardest part.
0425269205|5.0|I really love the Sookie Stackhouse novels. Although you might want one ending, it isn't always what you expect. I think Charlaine could have made an exclusive story for this final. Sometimes it was short and it all went too fast. Nevertheless, the novel is amazing and I love the ending. Worth every penny.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I love the music, and the videos are incredible! This is a great cd, and a lot of content for not much money.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I can't wait for the next one to come out. My friend lent us the season 1 DVDs. I started to read the books. Whatever you think is going to happen is totally wrong. No characters are safe. Brutality!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My daughter's school used this as a way to teach that everyone has gifts to bring to this world.  Watch it with your kids and then ponder with them what gift they might have to make this world a better place.  Someone once said where your greatest gift meets the worlds greatest need this is your calling.  Enjoy!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|the people seem so real and she fit them together so well i enjoyed how he learned to love his half brother and picked the woman of his dreams
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Read all of the books in a few weeks. Right before the third season started our friend loaned us the first two seasons on DVD. I was hooked. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  The filming of nature is worth getting this movie, the scenes are so moving.  Most of all this film attempts to answer the nagging questions we all have within from one man's story.  The movie is full of suspense so you might not want to watch it right before bed!  As I said earlier though I watched this movie twice in one sitting, it is that powerful.  Enjoy!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Preferable to charging with PC - faster - able to finish a book when battery low. I  highly recommend this for anyone who is anvid reader.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Grabs your attention and does not let go.  The storyline follows the formula of his other books, which makes it predictable but also a quick and entertaining read.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great relateable characters, believable relationships and wrapped up in sci-fi. A geeky girl's dream come true. It's a pity that it didn't get picked up for a second season. They really missed the boat on this one. The good news is, there is the movie!
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This is a great game that is fun and visually appealing!<br />My kids will love it and my wife might actually play and enjoy this one. It's challenging enough to not get bored, but easy enough to not get frustrated.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game brings out my inner child.  I didn't think playing a game like this would be so much fun but it is very enjoyable.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Here's the thing, it's a movie about a family that survives a Tsunami. The tsunami scenes are very realistic, very loud and very long. This is good and bad of course. And of course you'll want to smack the husband at some point during the movie. This is an incredible true story and interesting to contemplate such a disaster but very hard to watch.
0385349947|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who works in the corporate world as an HR Director.  She read it over a week end and thoroughly enjoyed the author's incite and personal journey up the corporate ladder.  She highly recommends it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really liked the way thing ended so, go ahead and enjoy the last book in this series, but I sure hope she writes some more!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I really did not expect this to be more than a hokey thriller but it was much more than that. The story was intricate and interesting and plausible. I don't think you'll be disappointed in watching and I am surprised there has not been more press about this well crafted movie.
141659521X|5.0|This book is vintage Flynn, with Mitch Rapp getting rid of the bad guys as only Rapp can.  For followers of Rapp, Stan makes an appearance, too.<br /><br />Topical as ever, this book takes Mitch to Afghanistan to take care of business.  He fights corrupt Afghan officials who are more interested in feathering their financial nests than in building a free and secure country.  He also encounters treachery at every level while he is solving the disappearance of the in-country CIA chief analyst who has intelligence information in his head going all of the way back to the Cold War.  When this captive succumbs to the torture which is sure to follow his abduction, CIA operatives all over the world are at risk and in danger.<br /><br />There are more twists and turns in this Rapp book than in most of the others, with excitement pouncing on every page.<br /><br />A truly professional job, as always, by Fylnn and an exceptionally good read.<br /><br />Warren
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|The iPad page for Wreck-It Ralph indicated that I could download it to my TiVo. I have done this with other movies, so I rented the movie.<br /><br />The iPad page for my digital library indicated that my TiVo was not configured for downloads. It is.<br /><br />When I view the page in Safari on my Mac it indicates that I can download Wreck-It Ralph to my Kindle Fire. I do not own a Kindle Fire. Anyway, I want to watch it on my TV.<br /><br />I have previously tried to watch movies on my TV through Amazon Instant Video on my iPad. The app indicates that it does not support passthrough.<br /><br />This is the second time this has happened, and my third problem renting instant movies from Amazon. I would be smart to give up.<br /><br />If it worked, and were reliable, it would be good.
1878424319|4.0|Some of the points are very powerful.  It is not fully consistent with my Christian beliefs. The core points of the book are very powerful.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This is a fun game but new areas coins disappear too easily in battle. I would prefer they ask require a confirmation prior to purchase. The battles don't make much sense but otherwise fun strategic game.
B005I64U5C|3.0|This in my opinion a very good movie.I seen it in standard definition 1st and loved it so when I seen it was available in 3d I was excited to see how good the graphics were.The best way I can describe my disappointment is this.Through the entire movie I kept checking the 3d settings to see if it got turned off.This title has the potential for being an awesome 3d movie like the avengers if you could actually tell it was 3d.Anyway it is a really good movie and you should buy it in standard definition but don't waste your money on 3d cause its just not there:(
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I really enjoy this series.  It is well acted, well scripted and most enjoyable.  I am watching the second season and think it is also very good.  Another 5 stars!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is very useful.  It is nice knowing your battery status I would recommend this app.  Thank you very much
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Although I had some struggle with myself to stick with this story in the beginning, I'm so glad I did.  Perhaps other readers were not surprised by the ending as I was, but I did not at all expect it.  Some of the descriptions of 86's sufferings were very hard to read, they were necessary to the story.  The description of Jamie's unfortunate meeting date with Lydia had me laughing  out loud.  My only criticism of this story would be that I would have loved to share in Jamie and Lydia' s joy as th they learned to live life in the warmth and comfort of newfound family.  I didn't want the story to end.
0385344228|5.0|Great read especially for anyone who has a 14 year old boy. This could be anyone's life. Disturbing but worth reading. A real page turner
B000FA675C|5.0|A fabulous story that was extremely well told. Could hardly put this book down til I'd read it all. Plot development exc as were the characters and the story. Lots of guessing as to how this would unfold happens. A surprise ending.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is an enjoyable match-three game, and as you level up you get to create your own aquarium of fish, decorations, and accessories.
0345455681|2.0|Unlike the previous book, New York, by David Rutherford, I found this very hard to follow the story line. It did not flow and stay interconnected through the decades as did New York. I gave it 350 pages and then I gave up. I was really looking forward to digging in with this huge novel and vanishing for several hours. It didn't do that at all.
0307454568|5.0|My only regret is that I read the back of this book before I finished The Girl Who Played With Fire.  Awesome, action-packed page turner that I would recommend to everyone!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Almost as good as his best. Complex characters and the moral dilemmas he does so well. I look forward to the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was better than the movie...Exciting and didn't want to put it down...I think anyone who enjoys fiction will appreciate thighs one!
0374275637|5.0|Kahneman does an awesome job explaining the two modes of thinking (essentially fast and slow, as in the title), and other similar dichotomies of the human mind, referencing groundbreaking studies of his own and others.  The number of applicable life scenarios that the ideas of this book touch is too extensive to list.  These ideas can help you answer the question of whether or not to trust the services of paid professionals, of how to make (seemingly) difficult decisions, and how to temper the understandable limitations of the human mind.  Although we are not wired to understand statistics instinctively in making rational decisions, Kahneman identifies many of the common logical fallacies and the types of situations in which they arise so that readers may consciously counteract the influences which all-too-commonly cause us to make irrational decisions, and he does so using studies, anecdotes, and an interesting vocabulary to label the various modes of thinking at play.<br /><br />Read it!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Every season is a good one . never disappointed in an episode . Great plot and not over done as some shows are
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|this album is def not for kids. the music is amazing and the lyrics are hilarious. if you like 80s rock n roll and have a vulgar sense of humor then buy this cd.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Too bad additional seasons not available.  Maybe wait till they are and then you can see several seasons at once
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Although I have come to love and enjoy the characters and story line I had to only give this book a 2 star rating. I am totally DISAPOINTED that after the long anticipated and long waited end of what was supposed to be a trilogy,  we are now forced to AGAIN wait for yet another book. This was supposed to be a 'trilogy' not a series! Even more disappointing because book 3 wasn't even a good read. It seemed rushed and poorly written, like the writer was just grasping for any thought to somehow extend the trilogy further and just get the book released.... so now we wait for book four and then another book that will become redundant. This trilogy had the makings of an awesome love story, now totally ruined by the writer for only one reason.... making more money from readers. Totally unfortunate! I would had preferred to wait longer for the release of book 3, paid more $$ and have this supposed 'trilogy' be a great read and have it conclude as it should had been.<br /><br />Mrs. Sylvia Day please don't make the wait time for book four another year. We know Eva and Gideon are soul mates, please mend their broken characters by placing responsibility on those adults that neglected to protect them as children... Gideon's mom, Dr.Lucas to name a few. Let Eva's mother have closure by seeing her daughter finally happy. Ship that sorry ass Corinne back to her French husband or do whatever with her character (no-one cares!). Give some dignity to self-destructive Cary and let him see that Trent is the person he should be with so he can finally dump that idiot/catty/self indulged Tatiana. Let Brett just move along with his band. AND just solve the mystery of who is helping Gideon get over with murder. Perhaps another good idea would be to continue with short novellas on these different characters, and offer readers a glimpse of Eva and Gideon lives as the move forward.... but just end this supposed trilogy with book 4 please.<br /><br />END OF STORY!
B004DTLK8A|5.0|I love this album it has a very 80s future vibe to it. if you love journey and dragon force look no further.
B00881PTRC|5.0|the hung man is surly silly, he cries, and makes pleading gestures,  all witch makes this is a fun game try it
B00296A4F4|5.0|Gotta love the dancing and singing. Pretty good for a story line. Easy to follow if you watch in order.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I watched Smash!  I really got in to the story line and enjoyed seeing the intricacy of the making of a broadway show.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I didn't like it.<br />I was entertaining, a light reading, but It's supposed to demonstrate that you can achieve anything with your thoughts, but the experiments didn't work for me.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I found this the other day while looking for a show to watch.  Decided to try it and now cannot get enough!  Wish there were more seasons
B006TJXZ30|1.0|This app shows only the past 30 days of activity. For older you have to log onto Outlook through the browser which is a nightmare to use. To scroll through messages you have to use the scroll bar which is tiny and disfunctional. I often get a blank screen when logging on. The screen is jumpy, especially because of ads. I can't even contact MS about the problems because their &#34;contact us&#34; pop up won't allow me to type in the problem. (If there is a &#34;mobile page&#34; for Outlook, I see no way to switch to it.) Anyway, about the app, why only the 30 days.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I like the construction of this cable. It works great with my 2.0 amp charger for the N10. I wish the N10 did not have a direction-specific construction for this port, it's just a little annoying. Can't wait for Apple's patents to expire so we can see this feature in a port that is not so big.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|This app loads and works like it should.  It's easily avaliable to check out places  in a new city quickly
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I just received the Darius Rucher CD True Believers and it is great. I love it, especially the songs Wagon Wheels and True Believers. I love every track of this CD. I also was pleasantly surprised to be notified that this CD as well CD's I had previously ordered were now available in free MP3 version to download to my computer and iPod. Thanks Amazon.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|We rented this movie one evening while friends and family were visiting.  We were searching for a flick that would cater to a mixed crowd in terms of age, gender, and movie genres preferences.  This movie fit the bill nicely.  The fact that none of us neither disliked it nor loved it is testament to its wide appeal. It's probably not one that I'd watch again, but am glad to have seen it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I downloaded this to my kindle and I love it.  It is very easy to use.  It is very user friendly.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|And The Mountains Echoed is another in a fine line of well written novels of heartbreak and despair. Hosseini tells the tale of a multi-generational family saga that is set off with the traumatic decision of a family to sell off one of their children.<br />Brother and sister Abdullah and Pari are inseparable after the death of their mother. Their father remarries and in their poverty, makes a decision that will impact his small family for generations.<br />Now living separate lives, And The Mountains Echoed follows the pair and the people who are impacted by this one moment in time. A moment so powerful, no one will quite ever recover.<br />Another awesome read from Hosseini.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I absolutely love Dexter and am very sad that it is coming to an end soon.  Such a great series!!
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Christopher McQuarrie's adaptation of Lee Child's No 1 Best Selling novel series featuring Jack Reacher. This mystery crime drama is adapted from `One Shot', #9 of 17. As an ex-military policeman turned vigilante drifter is called in to help investigate after an expert sniper takes the lives of five random victims. The prime suspect Barr (Sikora) insists upon his innocence and believes he's been set up and asks for Jack Reacher (Cruise). Barr's lawyer (Pike) asks Reacher to investigate the shootings, Reacher is led to believe there is an unseen force pulling the strings of the investigation and he's determined to get to the truth.<br /><br />Fans of the Reacher series have voiced their dislike of Cruise playing Reacher, who is a bigger broader and taller character in Lee Child's books. But Lee himself has said, \\"Cruise doesn't soften the character and will grow with the film adaptations.\\"<br /><br />As reviewed in the May 2013 issue of An Cosant&oacute;ir (The Defender) The Irish Defence Forces Magazine by Sgt Wayne Fitzgerald - dfmagazine.ie - military.ie
B000FCKGPC|4.0|In this fourth novel, Martin contains himself to the telling of King's Landing and the Lannister's who after the murder of Robb Stark and the death of their own King Joffrey hold tenuos power in the kingdom.<br />Cersei is in control but as usual she is her own worse enemy. In the Iron Kingdom a new King is crowned and they look to make themselves feared now that they no longer bow to the North.<br />We also follow Brienne as she still seeks to find the lost daughters of the Stark family, Arya and Sansa; we follow the plots of Petyr and there is an immergence of a new house and their desire to align themselves with the Dragon queen while paying homage to Cersei.<br />But the major change and factor in this book is the growth and change in two of the main characters, Jaime Lannister and Arynn Stark.<br />Jaime, who's sole desire was to return to the sister he loves now sees her through unclouded eyes and feels his love for her waning. As much as Jaime Lannister can, he is growing a conscious.<br />Arya is slowly becoming the tool that will avenge her family. Do not get attached to any of the characters in this series though, Martin has no problem killing any of them off.
B002O2THRO|4.0|All star cast and director but too much liberty taken with the plot.  Added severe themes that were not in the book.  I actually liked the A&E version better because it gave more opportunity for imagination and suspense.
0061433063|4.0|Pratchett casts his spell, and I go under! The magic he reveals has a way of revealing something about ourselves as well. That's a pretty good trick for mere entertainment!
B0015DROBO|5.0|It started a little slow with a lot of background, but once you get into it, it's a real page turner!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Good quick and easy way to know how much charge is left. I go it for the free app of the day
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Even though I knew how it would end, this brilliantly directed story put actors talents together for a masterful thriller.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|This was not the usual mass slaughter movie this  made the movie better and provided a better plot, one that a person could be entertained with
B004K583KA|5.0|I love this set...I have about 2/3rds of Suzuki's set and maybe half of Harnocourt/Leonhardts and have heard a dusting of the Gardiner set. They're all special really; I love the spareness, beauty and angst of the Suzuki set, and the bare passion of the Harnoncourt set and now here's the Rilling Set.<br /><br />After listening to about 2/3rds of it I'm loving Bach all the more. I hate to saw it's a more 'comfortable' set because that makes it sound boring so I guess I'll just say Rilling produces a beauty and richness I find very compelling. Rilling's not trying to go anywhere fast, he's settled into his groove and its a lovely groove indeed.<br /><br />My favorite? If I listened to 40 discs of the Suzuki set I imagine it would be my favorite but this is Bach, Rilling's a master in his right and this set at this price is easily the greatest steal in my collection.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field were not the only superb actors.  The entire cast should have gotten awards.  I learned that the feud between Democrats and Republicans is nothing new!  The command of the English language and eloquent arguments cries to be seen over and over. This film is more than a lesson in history, it should be watched by everyone on the planet.
B008VPDD6O|4.0|This entry in the series of Final Destination movies is worth adding to your collection. It has the 3D and regular versions. I have a 3D laptop and the effects are worth checking out.
B005DKLPF6|4.0|Mastodon is a progressive metal band, my favorite type of metal. Their crack the skye album is still my favorite, but this album offers some good tunes. A little heavier then the previous album but still finds a balance. Dislike, the simplicity of the lyrics.
B009KWU6Q2|3.0|This is a fun family movie with jokes both above and at child level.  Somehow the picture quality suffered or I would give it another star.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|Great classic movie bought it to watch in 3D but was very disappointed as the 3D froze alot and the quality was very poor. Was better to watch in normal 2D.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|This game makes me feel like I'm playing real pinball. Everything about this game is great. It's a great game to kill time and best of all it's free. The only thing you need to pay for is more pinball tables I recommend you get this game.
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|The movie was beautiful and I loved the costumes. And I liked the story but they spent A LOT of time explaining it when they didn't need to.  We got it already!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Loved the story line the 3D is amazing the best 3D movie that I have seen. Highly recommend you will enjoy.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I consider this to be one of bruce willis's best action funny movies I have ever seen..Not to mention thee all star cast...
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Mystery, intrigue, romance, action, comedy, horror, sci-fi...this show has it all.  Probably not for young children, but everyone else will like Fringe.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is full of adventure and action the best book u will ever read. Full of romance and love
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a good game. I would get this if some one has not.it's not  a bad game try it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was clever and inventive. With a few moments that even made me jump. A great game for a lazy day at home.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Great episodes. The doctor never fails to deliver. The HD quality & sound component of the Kindle FIre HD makes Doctor Who come to life.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I liked it a very much because the relationship between Bruno and his friends for life was so cute. Everything about Bruno was adorable . The only thing I didn't like was the ending was how it was some what unclear, but anyone that knew anything about world war two should have known he died.<br />I give this book a 9.5/10
B009LXEBD4|5.0|kelly is a guilty pleasure for me. i really enjoyed this disc as it is packed full of fun music and is a great value
B0085YOD1A|1.0|theres nothing on here that is not already on my kindle fire. Do not get it even if it is free.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I just just enjoy the PAC-Man game so much. Back when I was a kid and now! Thanks for the fun app!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|This app is a good tool to have, but kinda funny in the way of what you can do. Otherwise a great app
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book was easy to follow. It gave information for the subjects I needed to know about and it was easy to read.
B003VPUX9O|5.0|The Kill Artist is well written - never dull- never rambling.  I bought it as a gift for a friend (read it first) and he is going to 'pass it on'.  Good books should always be passed on.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The writing and story draw you in and the conflict, corruption and intrigue keep you reading for hours on end.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I was so looking forward to this book but it was a big let down. You could have started this book in the middle because not much happens. The second half was better until you get to the end and its not the end. Come on Sylvia it was a 3 book deal now how many more are you going to add to the trilogy.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I went into Entwined With You with the attitude that, if this book did not blow me away... I was not going to continue with the series. I don't know if it was the book being pushed back 2x! Or the fact that I wasn't that huge of a Gideon Cross fan. I always said, yes I would enjoy a night in the sheets with Gideon. But, to make him an official book boyfriend? Nope, I wasn't ready. His mysterious attitude and the fact that I did not feel a strong connection to him outside of the magic he can do in the bedroom, Gideon was just Gideon to me.<br /><br />...Until<br /><br />6/4/13 at 5:30pm when I was at Starbucks reading Entwined With You and officially got my life!<br /><br />Talk about putting pressure on an author. When I was on page 1 I said ,\\"Dear Book Gods please let me blown away by this book!!Please\\" Lol I have been doing ALOT of reading lately but nothing has BLOWN me away great stories but not BLOWN!<br /><br />Well, right  within the first 25 pages I was already panting and in need of water (with ice please).<br /><br />Gideon Cross = INTENSE<br />There is nothing simple or cheesy about him. He's a balls deep kinda man (look Ma no hands, pun intended) . Not just the construction work that he does in the bedroom. But everything about him is intense! The way he talks, walks and speaks. He says it, does it and that's it. Shut up, take it because he is Gideon Cross B#$$h !  \\"<br /><br />\\"You opened the door\\" he snapped \\"We're walking through it.\\" p. 21 -SAY that ISH Gideon!<br /><br />His name alone commands respect. In Entwined With You I really fell for Gideon .I got to see a side of Gideon that I didn't even know existed and it's all thanks to Eva. All the fighting , running and arguments between Gideon & Eva really have matured and blossomed them into this growing power couple. In Bared to You I felt like their relationship was forced and I didn't feel it had a strong foundation outside of lust.<br /><br />Well now i'm a believer! Gideon + Eva = FOREVER<br />Entwined With You was exactly what was missing for iffy Crossfire fans like myself (in the past). The story starts exactly where Reflected ended and does not skip a beat. Literally while reading Entwined With You the outside world didn't matter. I needed to keep reading because I was loving all the conversation and banter happening. We got to see Gideon interact with Eva's family, friends and of course the most beautiful thing their interactions with each other.<br /><br />\\"I hate to freak you out...But you've got it real bad for me.\\" p. 31<br /><br />The primary purpose (IMO) of Entwined With You was for readers to get to know the characters. There was so much lust in book 1 and drama in book 2 we needed a break! Lol now i'm not saying there isn't lust and drama in book 3 theres plenty of it BUT a major difference is there's actually conversation!<br /><br />Who could've known that Gideon could be so romantic?<br />\\"You were with me... Wherever I am whatever I'm doing. I belong to you.\\" p.32<br /><br />\\"You don't ow me anything...My love for you is not an obligation.\\" p. 60<br /><br />\\"Day one of my life was the day I met you.'\\" p.66<br /><br />\\"I'd stop the world from spinning for you.\\" p. 164<br /><br />There is one particular scene in the book all I have to say is \\"airplane!!\\" WOA I mean literally I went through so many emotions in those 2-3 pages. Anticipation, Steam, Fear, Excitement and then Satisfaction, Revelation and Grief. Ugh ladies I can not wait for you to read that part so we can talk about it.<br /><br />Michelle describes that scene the best<br /><br />@Michelle6803 she wanted to show him her love for him,nothing is off the play with them, esp. in bed.<br /><br />The love that Gideon and Eva have for each other is dangerous, explosive and real.No one understands them or why they love each other they way they do but thats okay because they understand. I love how they are unapologetic about their love.

B001R0O9K4|5.0|I have taught &#34;The Irish Experience in America&#34; and showed this film in class because you have to understand the Irish experience first. Julia Roberts is very convincing as an Irish woman (her middle name is Fiona--which is VERY Irish) and Liam as the Irish fighting leader is perfect. Although there are 36 million Americans with Irish roots, very few seem to know many details of Irish history, which is sad. I was in Dublin not long ago--hard to imagine what was going on there in 1920 or so. This film shows it with reasonable accuracy.
1400069807|5.0|A GREAT Book is the result of GREAT investigative reporting and this is one of those books. Others mentioned it and so will I, it's not a Diet book nor a how to eat properly book and it doesn't make such a claim. It does describe in part how the processed food industry works and the over reliance of the 3 ingredients in the title. The 3 ingredients have their own section clearly describing the benefits of their use to both the consumer and manufacturer. The sections are also presented in their level of \\"dependency\\" ranging from the least dependent to the most (apologies for difficulty in articulation). You'll learn alot about the industry and it's a bit scary. The part of the book that truly scares the HELL out of me deals with Nestle and how they produce some of the worst processed foods on the planet and on the other end how they're producing \\"food-drugs\\" to help deal with problems resulting from those very foods and their foray into medical industry.<br />SICK<br /><br />He uses & cites excellent sources many of whom worked in the industry and were members of the Senior Leadership at their respective companies.<br />He does a good job - IMO - of being objective and presenting what is factual information. You'll draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />A few things I noticed throughout the book are:<br /><br />1. All about making $$$ for these companies and nothing will stop them w/o one hell of a fight.<br /><br />2. Marketing at a level many of us are not aware of nor thought was possible.<br /><br />3. Despite the fact that the excellent sources he uses believe that the companies they worked for are good places, you only need to<br />see the result of their work and ferocity they'll fight to keep those products on the market to know that these are not good caring about consumer companies.<br /><br />This book will probably do more in motivating you to change your eating habits than most diet books, movies, etc..<br /><br />Definitely read and share with others when you get a chance.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another glance into the ever growing yet complex relationship of Gideon and Eva. I'm just as in love with them as I had been at the end of Reflected in You, but praying the 4th book is about finished!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|There wasn't one boring sentence in the entire book.<br /><br />This is unashamedly both an unconventional, yet conventional love story about a pair of love-struck misfit teens that buds in the most unforgiving place ever - the school bus.<br /><br />The school bus is like a micro eco-system representation of life in school, with the resident bully, the sidekicks, the mousy kids that stay under the radar. And then there was Eleanor and Park. Eleanor with her big, big red hair and Park, who is of Asian descend. They might as well both have been wearing a clown hat and rode a unicycle.<br /><br />Misfits as they might be, they are extremely likable and in love. I like how Rainbow Rowell have written them to be extremely individualistic characters that are so different in every way, but as a reader, you root for them all the way. Despite everything that the world (and at times their own hormones) throw at them, the pair fights valiantly to stay together. Their desire to just be close to one another makes me wish I could pen my desired ending, and this is testimony to how much I love the characters.<br /><br />This book sets the pace from the beginning and doesn't let off throughout. Pages turn furiously as the reader embarks on an exciting, funny, smart, relatable and at many times, extremely moving adventure in a book that has easily (and without pretension) made its way into my all-time top 10 list.<br /><br />I strongly strongly recommend this one. :)
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Acting was great but story seemed to be dragged out, it would make a good history lesson and the scenery was exceptional
B00D2ZF24O|2.0|This is a rather disappointing science fiction film. The movie consists mostly of Will and Jaden Smith. Man leaves Earth. Will becomes a hero ranger fighting alien monsters. He can also sense &#34;graviton expansion in the hull.&#34; Seriously? After the ship is forced to crash land on a hostile earth, Will, who is more commander than father, is injured and must direct his son remotely to retrieve the distress beacon from the tail end of the ship, 100 km. away. I felt I was watching &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; meets &#34;The Bone Collector.&#34;<br /><br />That's pretty much it. The trek had some numerous encounters with danger, but I found myself getting bored. Sorry Jaden. For a planet that freezes over every night it sure did have an abundance of green vegetation and animals. Anybody else scratching their head on that one?<br /><br />On the plus side, this science fiction incorporates advances based on discoveries with nano technology. It is the next step in science fiction writing. Jaden's suit could sense a predator and would change color similar to my Nokia Morph concept phone sensing toxins on my apple.<br /><br />Honestly, the Asylum mock buster had a better plot. Wait for the rental.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.

B006ZNRD06|5.0|This player will play all the videos I have tried so far. Other players only play some videos.  Also it will let you stop the video and start again later in the same place. It will let you change the orientation so you do not need to have the power wire on the bottom of the kindle HD. You can easily fast forward or back up in the video. Videos ar easy to find in the directory. Some players do not even alphbetize the videos in the video search. It has lots of extra options also.  This player is worth getting!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This has to be one of the most poorly written books i have read. I never review books but this one is just atrocious
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Not bad, I'd recommend this for anyone under 20, it's a nice escape from the real world. It's very clean and easy to read as well. I believe being 22 and reading this forces you to look at too deeply into the story and miss the point.
1401207529|3.0|I really can't stress enough the impact that Miller's \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" had on me and my continuing fascination with comics. I've stumbled upon it sometime during mid-nineties (yeah I'm young, so kill me) in some translated version parts of which somehow came to be in my possession. I don't remember details like these anymore, all I do remember is how I felt afterwards. In mid-nineties all I could say about Batman was that I knew of it (Croatia was never big on US superhero scene). I watched Burton's movies, television broadcasted that Adam West show from the 60's which I was a big fan of at that time, I've known about key points of the character and that was about it. As far as I was concerned, Batman was all about a guy fighting colorful criminals while wearing weird costume (to this day, one of the better short descriptions of the main topics of Batman is \\"wealthy man assaults mentally ill\\") and having cool gadgets whilst doing so. Even in Croatia, there were constant arguments amongst school-going crowd about who would win in a Superman vs. Batman situation. In every scenario we could think of, Superman always emerged as a victor. I mean, guy is made out of steel, and Batman can't even fly. That's how much lore we were aware about at that time.<br /><br />Anyway, Miller's DKR came to be before my eyes and I was astounded. I couldn't really grasp what was going on (main reasons being age and the fact that these pieces that I had weren't a whole book) but I could feel the power. I could feel that there is something different about that comic (I mean, old Bruce Wayne, dark, noir-ish atmosphere in total contrast with Adam West show which served as a key source for all our Batman related knowledge) and when I think of it now, I think that reading those few pages of DKR was the singular moment in which my subconscious mind understood that comics could be more than adventure stories about exotic places and guys fighting crime. I understood this in a more rational way at the later point in my life, but at the time that was a revelation. Rather important one as it turned out.<br /><br />In following years, despite the effect of DKR, I never became a Batman fan. You know the type - the one that obsesses about continuity, key points of the character, storylines and whatnots. I've conditioned myself to read every Batman (and every superhero story) as a singular event, as if nothing ever existed prior to this or that story, and as if nothing will ever come after it. Every Batman comic is a universe for itself and if that universe works on its own terms than I couldn't care less what it does to continuity. Instead of becoming Batman fan I became a Miller fan. Still am, despite that craziness that \\"Holy Terror\\" is.<br /><br /> I was telling you all this so you can better understand where I come from when I say that I was neither inspired nor excited by Batman: Year One. It's a rather straightforward narrative which borrows from the cult of Batman, just like DKR did, and tries to build upon it. What has been built though is nothing more than an origin story which is fine if you like that sort of thing but is utterly bland if you're not big fan of maneuvers like that. Where DKR used his characters and setting in a symbolic manner that reflected time, space and an entire discourse in which it was being done, Batman: Year One does nothing of the kind. Gotham is corrupt, and here comes the avengers that'll do something about it. Marvel at them and clap your hands if you recognize them. Mazzucchelli's art perfectly captured this kind of disintegrating Gotham, but Mazzucchelli is no Moebius and his art couldn't take you away from Miller's story which - if you read it now of course (it might have had a different effect at the time it was published) - turned out to be rather simple. There are few crowning moments of awesome (as TV Tropes would put it ) I must say but apart from that there's not much here that would appeal to someone who isn'ta Batman fan already. I sincerely doubt that Batman: Year One would have the same impact on me as DKR had if I have read it in mid-nineties. So, dear reader, be advised - despite what you might've heard, despite various laudations and cries of excitement - Batman: Year One is much more fan-oriented, much more \\"core-superhero-style-done\\" and much more insignificant than his more famous predecessor is. By reading Batman: Year One you're emerging yourself into just another Batman story. If that works for you, than that's fine. There are far worse of those out there.a Batman fan already.

B009NY43NY|5.0|I am not happy that this will be the last time we get to hear from Sookie. I will miss her
B00ATP24SW|4.0|Yes, this is a positive review. This is by no means a terrible album. That said, it just isn't the quality that I usually get from this band. As an album alone, by any band, this is a very good album. As the follow-up to [[ASIN:B004DTLK8A Elysium]], by Stratovarius, this album falls slightly below my hopes. However, the band really sounds focused in their playing. Lauri Porra is laying down some intense bass lines, Jens is using more keys than ever before, and Matias is doing his usual god-like guitar work, but it's less complex as opposed to the previous two records, which I won't complain about. Rolf Pilve is welcomed on as the new drummer. On some songs, he plays it like Jorg, but with a different twist. On the good songs, he plays very heavily and gives the band a unique drum backbone. The real time to judge his playing, though, will be their follow up to this album due to the change in direction on this one.<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />1. Abandon- This one starts the album off rocking! This is one of their best opening tracks (only beat by Deep Unknown). This song is one of the album's best songs. Rolf's drumming on this is so intense! I can honestly say that this song's drum track is one of their best ever! Matias is shredding it up on this song. Timo is really singing well on this song as well! This song sounds like classic Strato, but with stronger drums. This one doesn't have a lot of the synthesizers that are going through the rest of the songs. Maybe that's why I instantly liked this one. The solo part is phenomenal as usual and this is just a great song. I wouldn't want them to change a single thing on this one. I'd love to see this one played live as well!<br /><br />2. Unbreakable- This is what my first taste of the album was. This is the first single and I heard it back in December. While it has grown on me since then, I still don't like it. I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. It has a good melody, a good beat, and it's light spirited, yet it still has enough of a drum/guitar edge to headbang to. I just don't like it. It does get my head moving at times, but ehh...the chorus is what ruins it for me. The verses and the prechorus are actually really good. Same quality as the opening track, but the chorus, as one review stated, is kind of silly to sing along to. As usual, the music is top notch, and the synths on this one are tolerable. They don't annoy me. The chorus just makes this song a let down for me. It's a decent single, but there's a song later in the album that could've been a better single.<br /><br />3. Stand My Ground- This song initially irritated me because of how heavy the synths were. However, they are only heavily used in the beginning. The music here is actually really ambitious and heavy. This is definitely a song that stands out from the rest of Strato's catalogue. It's really heavy and almost a thrash/power metal mix in the verse and then the chorus is a slow, power metal anthem that really entices you to sing along. I actually have to say that this is a very good song and it's brilliantly executed. I wouldn't say it's one of the album's best, but it's probably number 4 on the list of songs from best to worst. I really enjoy this song.<br /><br />4. Halcyon Days- Well I found the worst song on the album. I don't know what it is about this one that just makes me dislike it so much. I guess the synths kind of make me not like it as well as the vocal processing. The chorus though is another one that I just feel silly singing along to. I guess if you took the synths out, it would sound like a Tolkki-era song. Because literally, it actually does harken back to those days. I think that's a step backwards (literally), but it's not a good one. I love Stratovarius as a whole, but I find them to be making higher quality music without him. This song is an exception because it honestly sounds like something Tolkki could've wrote. I'm not a fan of this song. I think it's easily the worst thing they've done since 2005.<br /><br />5. Fantasy- This song is a classic power metal song. It's got some lyrics based in fantasy (never would've guessed from the title), but it rocks. I do like this one. It's not one of the album's best, but it certainly does rock! The chorus is good. I like it. It's a good tune to sing along to. This one isn't heavy loaded with synths either. This one also has some good guitar crunching, but not a lot of melodic work save for the solo. This song does have a key/guitar dueling solo section though. The keyboard counter-melody in the last chorus is really good. I honestly love that little counter melody :D Good song.<br /><br />6. Out of the Fog- This is the one song that sounds like what we've been hearing from Stratovarius on the previous two albums. This one has the progressive metal influence in it and it's easily one of the album's most intense songs. The riff is just intense! I must say that at first I didn't know what to think of this song, but now, it's easily in the top 3 songs they made on this album. This song almost has a groove metal-type riff going through it. It honestly isn't a power metal riff. It's between groove metal and progressive metal. The chorus though is absolutely power metal, but done in an epic tone. Not the happy Eagleheart type song. One notable thing about this song is the writers; It was co-written by Timo Kotipelto, Matias Kupiainen, and Jani Liimatainen (ex-Sonata Arctica). The solo section here really shows off the band's skills and Rolf's drumming through this section is really shown. In fact, Rolf shines in the instrumental section. He's a very worthy replacement to Jorg Michael. This is a song that Dream Theater or Symphony X fans should check out!<br /><br />7. Castles in the Air- This one starts off slowly on the piano and Kotipelto sings over it. Then the rest of the band comes in and it's an epic-sounding song. However, it just doesn't do much for me. I'll give kudos to Matias' guitar work onthis song, but overall, it just slipped off my radar. The chorus is also really good, but I think this song is just a bit too long. I know, heresy for thinking Stratovarius made a song under 7 minutes that's too long. I just have mixed feeling on this one. It's good, yet I still don't like it, yet on some days I do jam along to it. It's a good song. I'll just let it grow on me.<br /><br />8. Dragons- This one starts off on the keys as a fanfare and then boom! The band comes in and I can hear the emotion coming through Matias' guitar in the intro, yet he's still riffing/jamming! Great! The verse is a harken back to the Tolkki days, but the chorus is totally different. The emotion in the solos and guitar don't sound like Tolkki in the least bit, but the first verse sounds similar to rockers like I Walk to My Own Song. I can honestly say this is one of the album's best songs and this NEEDS to be released as a single. This CREAMS the two singles they put out from this album. This is definitely one to check out as well! GREAT song!<br /><br />9. One Must Fall- This is a first for Stratovarius. This is the first song that Matias Kupiainen has written single-handedly. He is the sole writer. And the result? This is another GREAT song!!! I really enjoy this song! However, it's not typical Stratovarius (maybe that's why I like it, because it's a new sound for them). It's a slower heavy song, but nothing like we've heard before. This has a crunchy guitar part and some rather heavy drumming and some small progressive elements in it. I honestly love this song, yet I don't know how other Stratovarius fans will react to it. It definitely proves the Matias CAN indeed write songs without Kotipelto's help. Overall, this one is epic!<br /><br />10- If the Story is Over- This is another Liimatainen-co-written track. Honestly, it's a very pretty song, it's very well done, but it doesn't do anything for me. I'm a ballad-loving person too. Yet I just don't really like this one that much.It's not that it's bad, because it's really not. I do think it might be too long though. A 6-minute ballad, no matter who made it, is long.<br /><br />11. Nemesis- As the title track of this album, this song is pretty important. Especially when being compared with previous title tracks, specifically Elysium. So how does this compare with Elysium? It's much shorter obviously and it's more of a heavy rocker. It's good in it's own right, but I like Elysium better. This song does however close the album off well. Matias' guitar work harmonizes with Jens throughout the verses and music here is VERY well done. This song is another one of the essential songs from this album! I will say that the chorus is what really gets me into this song. The melody is unique and it just grooves when they add in all the extra counter melodies and the drumming work. The solos in here are great (what else would you expect?) The instrumental section isn't anything exactly new, but it is still notable. It's very well done. It just grooves and the melodies soar. The last vocal part in the album goes out with a bang! This song's last part with vocals is an intense jam. I really like this song's use of Kotipelto's voice. I would love to see this song performed live as well. It's one of their better ending songs!<br /><br />Verdict- If you like the previous 2 albums, give this album some time. You may not instantly like it, but overall, it's a good album. I think this album is an overall step in a new direction, but the keyboard presence of Polaris is back and some elements of the Tolkki era pop up in a few songs. But even so, it is still an evolving path. Obviously this album is good in its own right, but Elysium is still the best album they've made to date. I hope this prediction is right; I think that they changed directions again and their next album will build on this one and be a masterpiece like Elysium. That's just my prediction and my hopes. Again, this is a good album, but it didn't live up to my expectations in some aspects. If you like Stratovarius at all, buy it. It'll please Tolkki-era fans and the new fans.

B008QOH1NG|5.0|I bought this video simply because it was something like $1.99 so I figured I'd spend $1.69 on a Coke so I decided to buy it!<br /><br />I've only heard about this band since the 80's... May have heard &#34;to hell with the devil&#34; once in the past 20 years?<br /><br />I know none of their songs.<br /><br />I watched it and thought the production was very well done. The band sounded good, the camera work was fantasic and the mix of the music seemed correct.<br /><br />That's about all I can say since I know almost nothing about this band... If you are a Stryper fan, I would think you would like it? If you would like to know more about Stryper, I would think this is a good place to start, if you're just lookin' to pick up a video for casual browsing, I think this video has the balls.<br /><br />It's a very good video!

B002JVWRAO|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it as soon as i got it, Best show ever. You love super natural *hunting*, ghosts, witch and just wiered things all together you'll love this show.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I played this for a time this morning , and it is easy to learn and fun to play. Just a small word of caution, but not enough to remove a star -- if you are like me and certain games give you motion sickness, this is one of those.  I can play it for a while, then must put it away.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Fun movie, fine quality even at SD.  The whole family loves it.  The bug-type things are a bit scary for the little ones, but they get over it and love it.
0307165485|5.0|I had this same book when I was a kid, and it never got old.  I ordered this book for my 2 year old grandson, and he absolutely loves it!  It has so many pages with so many characters that your kids will never get tired of it.  I am sure it will be their favorite book.  You can't beat the price for a hard cover book with 200+ pages of fun stories and great artwork!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Director: JJ Abrams.<br /><br />Writers: Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof.<br /><br />Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Bruce Greenwood, Benedict Cumberbatch, Alice Eve and Peter Weller.<br /><br />Running Time: 132 minutes.<br /><br />Rated: PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Sci-Fi Action and Violence.<br /><br />There's something I really enjoy about JJ Abrams style of filmmaking. Yes, its flashy and fast and it may come off as a bit shallow, but there's something about it that gives off a spark that really gets me engaged. He can get establish a lot within the first 15 to 30 minutes of a movie, which would take most filmmakers quite a while to build up. Everything from the big action scenes, to the core characters and their motivations to what they do - He knows exactly what he's doing behind the camera.<br /><br />A prime example of this would be when he did Super 8. Within a half hour, we know just about the entire cast, what the kids are doing in the movie, the big awesome train crash that was so publicized happens and it happens at full force and it never feels like its overstuffing its self.<br /><br />Which brings us to his take on the much loved Star Trek franchise. These films of his really cause some weird reactions with people. They make nice amounts of money and get excellent reviews from critics, but if you went to a random forum on the cesspit that is the internet, you'd probably find the opposite reaction. Almost like as if Abrams and co. spat in the face of everyone's mother and other relatives.<br /><br />Personally, I actually really liked - hell, maybe even loved - his reboot of the Trek franchise. Great visuals, excellent chemistry, fun dialogue, fast paced, awesome music - It did a lot of things right, even if the plot was a bit confusing, with the alternate universes, black holes and what not.<br /><br />Something that puzzles the hell out of me is why did the sequel, Into Darkness, take so long? I know Abrams was busy with Super 8 but maybe he should have put that off (as much as I love that film) in favor of doing this. It probably would be doing better business at the box office and critics than it is doing now.<br /><br />Now, in the event you are wondering if I'm attacking the film or am going to spew out negative thoughts on the film, let's get this out of the way:<br /><br />I'm not.<br /><br />While Into Darkness certainly has its problems, and we'll get to those latter, its a worthy sequel to the original and one of the most entertaining things I've seen this year. It still has all the elements I loved from the original with a few new things thrown in.<br /><br />Set a few years after the original, the Federation has come under attack from a terrorist by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), a former Starfleet officer out for revenge after he felt that Star command screwed him over in the worst ways possible. The crew of the Enterprise, led of course by Kirk n' Spock (Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, respectively), are sent in to take him down by orders of one Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller). But while the plot may seem simple, things are not as they seem.<br /><br />I feel the need to get the bad stuff out of the way first, like in the same way a bratty child is forced to eat his vegetables before he can get to the good stuff. One of my main complaints of the film is that I feel it goes on for far too long. While Abrams's previous films have sported great pacing, Into Darkness kind of mess up a bit. There's filler in the movie that could have been seriously cut out and it would have been all the better for it, like bits where good ol Scotty (Simon Pegg) gets drunk off his ass or the bar scene between Kirk and Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood and yes, I know its done to show their Father-Son-like relationship but it came off as forced).<br /><br />Another thing that film does that bothers me is that it suffers from being unpredictable to predictable. There's some twists that caught me off guard but there's some stuff that can be seen a mile away. I think it may have to do with the fact that it had 3 screenwriters doing it, the first two being the scribes from the previous film Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman while the third scribe was divisive Prometheus and Lost writer Damon Lindelof. I always get this weird feeling like whenever Mr. Linelof is involved, the product always ends up spawning weird reactions with people. Eh, moving on.<br /><br />As for the good stuff for the film, a lot of the things that made the first film great are still here. The visual effects and set design are better than ever, ranging from seeing things like an incredible fight in hyper-space in which we see all sorts of people flying out of the hull as things explode left and right, to the now famous scene in the trailers and advertisements where we see a Starfleet cruiser crash into a sprawling metropolis. Michael Giacchino's score is still nothing short of incredible, bringing out some true excitement and wonderment to the universe and some of the music is bound to get stuck in your head after its all over.<br /><br />The performances across the board are quite good as well. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto continue to show they have their characters down pat and never ceases to stop being amusing from watching them be bros one moment to bickering about the rules and personal approaches to how the current mission on hand should be accomplished. Or how Karl Urban, who will always be Judge Dredd in my mind from now on thanks to to the excellent 2012 adaptation, continues to be the best replacement for Bones McCoy, with his quips and grumpy attitude.<br /><br />While some have had problems with the character of Dr. Carol Marcus, a doctor who pops up on the Enterprise under a different name (Don't worry: No spoilers), and her actress Alice Eve, I never really had a problem with her. I thought she did well with the material that was given to her, especially her scenes between her and Bones.<br /><br />But special mention must go to Benedict Cumberbatch as Harrison. Charismatic, intimidating, fierce and methodical are just the few words to describe his villain. One moment, you can go from being fascinated and even wanting to see him defeated, to feeling incredibly sorry for the guy. Quite a performance here. He's a true threat and makes the villain of the previous film, Nero (Eric Bana), look like a chump. No disrespect to Mr. Bana, who played a very fun and dangerous villain, but you look like old stuff compared to Cumberbatch. Kinda funny how the guy who has a ship with the ability to create black holes looks less threatening than one man with superpowers.<br /><br />One might ask me: \\"Is Into Darkness better than the original?\\" I cannot say no, as due to the problems I've mentioned here that were not or at least weren't as big in the 2009 reboot. Star Trek 2009 was incredibly fresh at the time and sadly, with this, some, if only a little of the polish has come off. But that's only minor. Both films are pretty much on the same plane, with Darkness coming up just a tad short.<br /><br />Into Darkness is bound to piss people off, as with most \\"sacred\\" works in nerdom, like whatever Joss Whedon pumps out or live action adaptations of Anime (which always almost suck). But even with the problems that the film has, there's still a lot to like here. If you can get past the pacing issues and the predictability of the film, you're in for one fun summer movie.<br /><br />Now that all that is said and done, two questions remain: How will Abrams take on Star Wars turn out and what will Paramount do with the next film in the Trek franchise? I've got high hopes for his take on SW, but I'm not sure what to think the next Trek film will turn out. I just hope they get someone who's just as confident and energetic as Abrams is.rom being unpredictable to predictable.

B00COHAUD4|4.0|I really didn't want to see it, but I did.  It was actually very good.  The ending was a little strange, but the movie as a whole was very good.  I creepy scary which is so much better than bloody scary.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Fell in love with the movie from the beginning shots!  Bethany's strong Christian faith and the closeness of her family is what makes this a great family movie.  I think this would make a great movie for a youth group to watch and discuss how even in some of the darkest moments of her life, she never stopped loving God.  Even when she asked why God allowed the accident to happen, she did it in a way that showed she respected His authority to do what He saw fit.  The extras at the end that showed the real Hamilton family was a treat!  Will watch this movie over and over!
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|Having read the others, had to get this one.  Clarke continued to amaze me.  Another great read.  Required reading for all Clarke fans.<br /><br />.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I love both of these games.  ICO feels like the grandfather of modern games like Uncharted and Tomb Raider.  The graphics are much improved, but it is still a very old game.  Great story that will stick with me for a long time.  Great gameplay and really great puzzles.  Some are very difficult, but very satisfying once you figure them out.  Great value for two of the most unique Playstation games ever.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This book is about the restaurant kitchen and the lives of the professionals who work there. Preparing food for the public requires physical stamina and definitely the ability to multi-task. It requires good judgement. It also requires being able to work with some deranged people, under pressure, yet still produce a superior product. Some people, especially immigrants,  work there because they must. Others are in the kitchen because they love the life. The book is sometimes scary, a great memoir. It took me a while to read, because I was savoring the story, like good food.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I had been wanting to read Fearless for a while.  When I saw I could get the ebook from my library I jumped at the chance.  I was not disappointed. I don't read a lot of non fiction, but am glad I made an exception for this.  You get to the point where you wonder how much Adam can overcome, yet time and time again he prevails.  He is very real, very human, and very extraordinary.  My only mistake was reading the last few chapters in a public place.  I may have known what was coming, but still cried for Adam's death and when Kelly is notified and the funeral.  Tears come even thinking of the sacrifice Adam and many others have made for my freedom.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Very nice graphics and cute story plot.  I definitely recommend it for any one!  Especially for mothers who let their children play on their Kindle.
B000YMDQQ4|3.0|I realized on the third story that i had read this book before. Which was very disappointing. It meant that it wasn't terribly memorable, in the way that many of his other writing is.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I road tested this charger for four days on a cross country trip in a rental moving van, followed by four days in a rental car. It performed superbly under these challenging conditions, keeping two iPhones and an iPad charged. The coil cord is long enough but not too long and the Lightening connector is sturdy and fits easily into the phone, even using a protective case (Switch Easy). I'll keep it in my own car now, for peace of mind on road trips as well as driving around town.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a really fun game. i love the fact that you get to level up and interact with the ponies-they're not just...there. yeah. oh! and it keeps up to date with updates and such. the only glitch i had was fixed, so im happy.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Sackboy and Mario have done explaining to do.<br /><br />I haven't yet played through more than the first few levels, but so far it is amazing
B00633W614|5.0|Am anxious to get the 3rd book in this series. In each book the reader in left in a quandary - What is going to happen
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I liked the book, although the presumably-accurate dialect made me feel like I was dragging an anchor through the pages. The story line made me start wishing for a resolution about halfway through, and soon after that the writer's solution was a little too heavily dabbed in with foreshadowing. It's starting to sound like I didn't like it but I did, I did.<br /><br />In a word, it was... quaint. That's good once in a while. A refreshing read, in its way, and a historical note at the end was a consciousness raiser on an important historical subject.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I knew this book was going to be about sex but, at some parts of the book it just gets to the point where you're like okay let's get back to the plot. Towards the end they actually give you some plot. Overall I would recommend it.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|This is one of my fav books of all time. I have read an re read it. When I realized my hard copy got donated in my last book binge I chose to down load the e-copy. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />This is a great take on an old legend. It makes you question the roots of religion an what makes someone a bad guy.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My kids really love this movie and it provides a very good context to discuss mother and daughter relationship, regarding acceptance, tolerance, consensus and love.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|If you're a fan of the series this will not disappoint.  The characters remain consistent and the relationships progress.  The murder plots have never been high intrigue and nothing changes this season.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Good movie, great action and characters. I did not like the ending very much (won't give it away though) but it was a very good movie.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|I could not stop watching, hoping for an answer for two lovers to make it to true happiness.  I sometimes wish I had been born in that time period, but they really were strong on tradition and the poor were really discriminated against.  I know the aristocracy is ashamed of the way they treated servants and poor just as we are now ashamed how we have treated blacks in the not so far past! This was a short series very much worth the viewing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game, got it on Kindle Fire. First got it because some friends had it and now I'm slightly addicted! I love how the theme changes and how I feel I have to go on it every day for the daily challenge. Also, it's great to connect to Facebook and see who's got the high score out of your friends and try and beat them. Overall great game, a must have for children and adults!!!
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of this show. Always seemsto surprise and amaze! WOuld watch it again.Awesome job to the director,high five to you!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I would like to see those planes in Melita fort to become drive-able. And more maps would be nice. And I wish they would give prizes or crystals to those who play more than one day like in Galaxy Empire. Other than that the game is awesome!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am enjoyed this book, it held my interest through out.  I found it difficult to put down.  It was different than what I normally read, however very enjoyable.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really into this book but as I got closer to the ending I realized I would be disappointed.  And, I was.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|I love all the Bernie Gunther novels and this is no exception except for perhaps a tad more descriptive violence.  Bernie's character seems to be slipping more and more into suicidal depression and I wonder if the author is going to end him soon. (I certainly hope not.)<br />The author includes the suffering of all - even the Germans- in a suspenseful novel with a twist in plot.  Enjoy.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app works. It was free so the price is right.  It's basic but it shows me what I need to know.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Who would have thought that Russell Crowe could sing. Hugh Jackman is another story, his voice was pitchy and I don't think he ever hit the vocals on the mark. The flick is a great story about the struggles in France just before the revolution. Anne Hathaway has a great voice and Amanda Seyfried has the pipes to carry any movie she sings in, watch Mama Mia.
0425263924|1.0|Really awful. No story. No ending. Obviously the author has gotten greedy, so after promising an end, she decided to keep going so that she can make more money.  This book was so disappointing and didn't move the characters much beyond where they were after the first two books. She should be ashamed to charge so much for this episode of what has become a boring soap opera.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Best scifi show in a long time. Good original plot line. Out of the box ideas and great action sequences.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|The best WWII submarine film ever made. The camera work makes you feel as though your one of the crew. You feel the tight quarters the boredom, and of course the mind rattling blast of the depth charges.<br />This movies truly allows you to understand the dangers that the sailors of the Uboat service faced and why till this day they suffered the greatest losses of any fighting force in history.
B00AUA67GQ|2.0|This is another of several products that I consider good for the jobs they are designed to do. But, I have found another that is much less complex, and does just what I need to do. I don't think there's anything wrong with this one, just not what I need.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Need more of these! Read all 3  and could not put them down.  Amazing story, kept my interest throughout. Waiting the next book.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|There wasn't a preview so it wasn't what I expected. The grandkids liked it though. I would recommend it for children.
030758836X|5.0|Here's a one-word review that sums up my reaction to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl (Crown Publishing, New York, 2012): Wow! I liked the book so much I am inclined to pick it up and read it all over again. Now. If you are looking for a perfect end-of-the-summer read, this is it.<br /><br />Amy and Nick have been married for five years. Indeed, it is there five year anniversary, when suddenly, Amy disappears. Suspicion turns to foul play quickly enough. Divergent perspectives on the marriage unfold in competing narratives presented in alternative chapters. We read entries from Amy's diary, showing a marriage unraveling because Nick is an uncommunicative brooder bordering on violence. Nick's chapters reflect his coping with Amy's disappearance and the gathering circumstantial evidence that he did her in. Is he really describing the same person who wrote the diary?<br /><br />Nick is very much like Scott Peterson, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of his wife and unborn child in California. Did Flynn study the Peterson case for material in this case? If she did not, then all cases of missing wives really do tend toward the same dismal archetype: study the reaction of the husband, look for signs of marital discord, find the other woman, and then bend every circumstance in favor of a conviction. I forgive Flynn her reliance on a reported case. As a criminal defense lawyer I know a truth most readers do not: Reality is often far more bizarre than fiction. Indeed, I turn to fiction for an orderly presentation of the universe; the practice of law is as chaotic as science fiction.<br /><br />Midway through the book, Flynn changes perspectives on Amy's disappearance. The chapters still alternate, presenting the competing points of view of this uniquely unhappy couple. Soon it becomes apparent that although the facts about Amy's disappearance are simple enough, the meaning given to those facts is a matter of misinterpretation. Lurking beneath the easy narrative created by the press and police as they try to determine what has become of Amy is the primitive stuff of which we are made: rage, the all-consuming need to bend the world to our will and our purposes, the need to believe in a reality less grim than our simple imperative to survive, and the too easy reliance on simple stories, stories that obscure complex and messy realities.<br /><br />I do not give away too much if I tell you the book is a study in sociopathy. This young couple made vows to one another, vows that define a marriage. Yet what holds them together seems less a commitment to a life in pursuit of common goals. Need binds them. That need is sometimes destructive. Yet they keep on keeping on. They cling to one another the way we cling to life.<br /><br />What chills about the book is the sense that despite the deceit, the distortions, the lack of any moral sense, the couple differ only in degree, not in kind, from the rest of us. From time to time you wonder whether the action described was a reverie rather than a recollection of an actual event. Flynn has never practiced law, but she knows a lawyer's truth: We are all capable of just about anything. Her genius is transforming an ordinary marriage into a thing of horror. She does so in small steps, steps you hardly know you are taking until you look back and wonder how you could have missed the obvious signs of things going horribly wrong.<br /><br />Marriage and life are like that. I am reminded of Soren Kierkegaard's observation: \\"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\\"<br /><br />Gone Girl is must reading for criminal defense lawyers. Consider the first part of the book to be an illustration of the power of circumstantial evidence to deceive. Just because we demand answers to life's untoward events doesn't mean that the best answers we can find are true. The narrative drive has, I suspect, convicted many an innocent man.<br />The second part of Gone Girl is a cautionarytale. What if the conspiracy theorists really are right? How much evidence do we ignore simply because it is inconvenient, or does not make sense? I recall years ago a client insisting that we call the CIA on his behalf. He was an undercover agent, he reported. Not a car thief. He passed his competency hearing with flying colors. When the Defense Department called looking for him we began to wonder just what was going on.<br /><br />The book's final part illustrates the truth of a maxim I've heard wise lawyers repeat from time to time: \\"You can lead a client to the courthouse, but you can't make them think.\\" The claims of reason are overstated. None of us truly live in a universe composed of discrete bargains in the law's shadows. We are all driven by inchoate imperatives that make reason one tool among many. The choice of irrational means to our destined ends is, by definition, unreasonable; but that does not make the irrational wrong.<br /><br />I love this book. You should too. Read it once. And, if you are like me, you will want to read it again. I suspect it will be even better the second time.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game. I keep telling myself \\"just one more round\\" and I just keep on playing.  It gets more challenging as you progress but not too hard you want to give up, just enough to keep you interested.
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|Kate Hepburn is radiant in this, one of her best.  Cary Grant and James Stewart are smart, suave, and the witty banter will make you want to turn up the volume.  The scene where Stewart is drunk and comes and wakes up Grant who, bemused, attempts to advise him...hilarious.  Grant is doing his best not to laugh, and Stewart does everything he can to make him dump the scene.  Nobody should miss this gem.
B0082SU98U|5.0|What a precious story! I saw the movie years ago, but this was far better. I'm going to start the sequel as soon as I finish this :)
B009O07NDY|5.0|Another great album.  The kids loved the movie and they love the music.  They even sing along with the dwarves.  They often ask to listen to the album on car rides - amazingly, it keeps them quite as they enjoy the music (and so do I). Thank you Howard Shore!
B005P06AAO|3.0|Awkward is a different kind of tv show with a different look at the way high school can be.
B004UC4HCG|4.0|It's working. I was trying to downsize my Windows system in my office - I used to have a big OLD gaming tower, and don't PC game anymore - and this is the perfect size compared to some other small form factor cases.  Just make sure you get the correct processor type if you plan to use the on-board video - i missed the fine print about that, and thought I had a defective product.  Shuttle support was great at suggesting a newer video card to use since the list of supported cards is rather out of date.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Great ,love it love them , one of there best C D  congrats another winner in my book !!  CONGRATS LADY A !!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Seems cool, I just got it and like how it monitors the Kindle.  I only got it because it was free.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This game is the same as those played on computer and other devices. To be honest I wanted to find out what Angry Birds was all about. I'm not much of a game player and didn't have anyone to show me, so I really didn't get the benefit of playing. If you like Angry Bird's this is it.
0316113077|4.0|it's didn't give me anything new as I was expecting to, but it's usable...I am not sorry i bought it...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for kids of all ages it shows patterns and it teaches hand eye coordination fun levels neat charachters that you will love
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I usually go more in depth on my reviews but guys free app of the day is rarely going to get better than this. A beautiful platformer great controls no tacked on IAP. Honestly shows mobile gaming at its best. Great for all ages. Pick it up I promise you will not regret it.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Great movie about a critical period in US history. Portrayl of Lincoln seemed very accurate. I recommended this movie to my middle school grandkids.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm a follower of this series, and most reading this review are as well. (If not...stop reading after these parenthesis and buy the 1st book. Seriously do it!)<br /><br />I preordered the book after finishing #2. I generally LOATHE reading series which aren't complete as obviously, if the books are great, I want immediate gratification of what is going to happen, and waiting months to a year can be irksome. I will generally wait until all are completely written, THEN start reading. This series series however, while I still wanted to know what came next, I couldn't turn off the story switch as I have on a few other series. I had to see it through. And eagerly await what is next for an intriguing story.<br /><br />When this book was delivered I went to the reviews just to see the star count it was getting. I wish I hadn't. It almost ruined my reading experience as many people rated merely one star simply because they didn't like the ending. NOT THE Entire STORY or story line.... just THE ENDING. The whole book...great but because it didn't end an unfair one star. I didn't know what the ending was as I tried not to read the reviews just look at the ratings. After I finished the book I went back and read the full justification and was furious.<br /><br />So I spent the whole story waiting for a ball to drop with a terrible conclusion. Instead I got exactly what I received the first two books. Intriguing story lines, multiple plots and sub plots, great charectorization, in depth primary and secondary charectors, heat, passion, drama, clean writing and editing.<br /><br />When I reached the so called horrible end everyone was braying on about, it turned out to be simply the story wasn't over and we have another book coming. I don't see the problem. It's  a great story and I'm thrilled there is more to tell. Honestly I would've felt cheated if all of the complex and intriguing story lines that pre-existed this book and the new ones introduced had been gift wrapped up for me rapidly without the level of storytelling I've come to expect from this author and series.<br /><br />I think it's a great story and obviously our ride has not reached its conclusion. For all those reviews complaining the ending sucks...Reader meet a story...story meet a reader. Obviously you are fans of the work why not enjoy that there is more than less while there is still so many unanswered questions?  While If there wasn't anything left to be revealed I could understand a bit more...but not when there are as many stones left unturned as there are.<br /><br />While I've been a self proclaimed fan of instant gratification regarding series I must say that some merit the wait until fully published...others you can't wait to read. This book does in spades the latter for me.<br /><br />I'm not ticked off I'm eager. If anyone who posted that the ending is horrible and is not going to read the next...you're review, while I disagree with it, I at least can understand your motivation. If not, and you will read the next, you should be ashamed of your selfish review. It's not the story that disappointed you but rather that all the intriguing questions you have aren't answered. That is what most would call a good read if your eager to know what happens next. In any event...this reader calls this a great read and I highly recommend it to the people who enjoy the genre.<br /><br />This book is engaging and spell binding. I can't wait for the next one. 3 books in and still enough suspense, drama and main and secondary plots to keep the hampster wheel a rolling.<br /><br />I hope potential readers do not let misplaced feelings on reviews spoil what could be a great reading experience for them.<br /><br />Here's looking forward to the next ride around the bend with Eva and Gideon. Awesome book by miles.<br /><br />Also to all reviews who claim greed, could it be that there is more story in the author? Who am I to say what the authors creative inclination is. Seems to me a writer of a multitude of works with generally high ratings wouldn't risk her reputation for a couple more bucks when she already is a best seller. Perhaps she listened to her fans love of this series and since it didn't end as she created she continued. Besides it was public PRIOR TO RELEASE that this wouldn't be a trilogy after all.<br /><br />Raters should rate on quality of product as opposed to what they think may be motivation behind the book. I don't buy a meal or clothes because the seller wants to make cash or because I think they might. I buy based on if I like the product. Same is true for books. Good book is what this is and a 5 star one at that. My other comments are personal opinions at what I feel are unfair reviews. Especially those who say they will check it at library but gave it one star only. Guess the story wasn't that bad for those who are still going to read it after their one star rating.<br /><br />I urge those who agree to give feedback on those reviews that are hypocritical. If not let them be or vote accordingly to your feelings on if the review was truly helpful regarding the content of the book. Authors generally don't want to alienate readers...yet obviously some think it is a great conspiracy.<br /><br />Read and see if book three doesn't still leave you thirsty for more. I'm rather parched myself.er of a multitude of works with generally high ratings wouldn't risk her reputation for a couple more bucks when she already is a best seller.

B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like the app. It's easy to use but I do have one request. This app needs a history button. I like to keep track of what I watch and a history button would be great.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have already given this game 5 stars in another review.  Don't know why I'm given a second chance to rave about it.  Get it for yourself, even if you don't think you'd like it.  Risk getting addicted!
B0083L22U4|5.0|I was a huge fan of Ultravox back in the 80s, and followed Midge Ure's solo career afterwards; have all the albums. This is right up there with the best. So happy they're back.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've had to reload Kindle to my Android 3 times.  I nearly gave up.  Whatever you do, don't try to voice-call anyone at their help line.  Do what you need to do in Chat only.  That way you will have a record of what they tell you.  People don't realize there are other book loaders available who will spam you once you use Kindle, but don't be fooled..  Kindle is the original.

B004ELSDZK|4.0|it is very challenging and the further you go the more difficult it is...like the way totemo always kept encouraging me to try again..sometimes to the point of me saying...shut up already...lol
