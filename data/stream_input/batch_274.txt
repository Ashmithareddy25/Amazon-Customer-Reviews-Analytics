B00005U122|2.0|I really can't believe people think this is better than Pulse!  The sound quality is good, but the back up singers are too high in the mix (very distracting, and the camera man seems to be infatuated with them).  An electric guitar starting Wish You Were Here?!?  David Gilmour, where are you when we need you?  Given the fact that these are some of my favorite songs....this DVD was uninspiring.  The only good thing about this DVD is getting to hear Roger Water's voice again.  Hate to say it but Guy Pratt's (on Pulse) bass playing is far superior to Roger's in every aspect.  Same goes for all of the other musicians.  Release Pulse on DVD and we won't have to settle for .... imitations anymore!
B00006CXXU|5.0|When i got this CD, and listening to it.... She has really grown as a person and a women. What I love about this ablum is that she just don't have soul, but rock feel. I can really feel what she is saying in each song...and when i heard &quot;A voice Within&quot; and i really can relate to that song.<BR>Christina, do ur thing! :)
B00003CWNR|5.0|A sensitive and intelligent character-driven film, adapted from John Irving's novel by the author himself, which features truly breathtaking cinematography, a lush musical score, and uniformly excellent performances by a formidable cast which includes Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, Kathy Baker, Jane Alexander, and supporting Oscar-winner Michael Caine.  The main plot line centers around a young man (Maguire), raised in an orphanage headed by a charismatic doctor (Caine), who decides to venture out into the world and learns the hard way that life is not merely black and white, but many subtle variations of gray.  While this is hardly a unique theme, the characters in &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; are so exquisitely drawn, and the movie so masterfully produced, that everything which might in lesser hands seem overly familiar appears fresh, new, and distinctive.<br />The DVD offers a perfect sound and video transfer, and includes a nice selection of &quot;extras&quot;, including a documentary on the making of the film, the original Theatrical Trailer, and highlights of the television ad campaign.  Overall, the DVD is an exemplary presentation of a bona fide modern classic, and one that's well worth multiple viewings.
B000002HHB|5.0|I can't really say much about this, except that it's brilliant and I have yet to meet anyone who can hear &quot;Beloved Wife&quot; without being moved nearly to tears.
B000062Y98|5.0|I am a huge Bling Guardian fan, I have many of their other albums including Nightfall in Middle-Earth, Imaginations from the Other Side, Battalions of Fear, and now A Night at the Opera.<BR>This album has a perfectly blended fusion of melody and metal making it tied up with my other favorite album, Nightfall, the vocals with the awesome riffs and pounding drums make it a truely inspirational CD, which inspired me to start writing songs similar to Blind Guardians style.  I just couldn't get enough of the first four tracks, especially \\"Precious Jerusalem\\" which has just got a powerful epic sound to it, if I had the chance, I would thank Blind Guardian for being so great, and to tell them to keep up the good work!
B000002UJQ|5.0|In my book, there are only 3 rock albums that are worthy of a comparison to the magnificence Radiohead created in 1997... The Beatles' &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, Pink Floyd's &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, and U2's &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;.  If you want to hear the upper potential of rock music and how it can communicate human emotion and ideas, buy this now.  In fact, if you like rock music at all, buy this now.
B000068TP0|5.0|Being someone who can understand NOT A WORD of what Shaikra says -- I still LOVE this music!!  It's a wonderful showcase of her talents -- and the close capitioning helps with the translations!  Nice format on DVD -- perfect sound quality.  Not a trendy purchase -- enjoy this performance for years to come!
B00005TT77|3.0|As opposed to some of the other reviewers, I rather liked this album. True, not every track is good (a few are *bad*) but many are great. Ben Harper does a great job on Strawberry Fields, and \\"Country Boy\\" is wonderful. Though the original Blackbird will never be replaced, Sarah does a good job here. Rufus Wainwright's version of Across the Universe is alright, but they ought to have used Fiona Apple's, it's killer. <br />All in all, I'd suggest simply downloading a few tracks unless you really enjoy beatles covers as I do. Some are better than the originals, in my opinion.<BR>~14:30
B000075BFK|5.0|this cd is the best cd ever. so is 2pac, the best rapper of all time.
0064471837|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book! Sabriel by Garth Nix is a fantasy with a perfect blend of magic, action, and the slightest, tiny, minuscule touch of romance. Sabriel is a great female hero.  The idea behind this book is spectacular and the vivid descriptions pull the reader into the novel. The characters are all developed amazingly well and I praise this work of Garth Nix, being a very novice writer myself.<br />I have recently finished Lirael Sequel to Sabriel and am anxious for the release of Abhorsen.  I hope that I will be able to wait until January before I explode with anticipation!

And there's some might tasty stuff on &quot;Material World&quot; and &quot;Dark Horse&quot; as well.  All in all, there are better selections available to one who wants to explore the music of George Harrison.
0375703764|5.0|i was braindead for about a day after finishing this book.  it's just the way it works.  this book wraps its talons around you, sinks its teeth in, and never lets go.  never.  you become a slave to it, reading at the pace it sets for you. (you'll find out what i mean.)  i read it about two years ago and i still get chills up my spine when i think about it.  it's my own fault for not heeding the book's dedication/warning.  (definitely one of the only books i've read that distinctly told me not to read it).  yes, i speak of this book as an entity, because it is.  it's about a house.  the house knows that it's a house.  it also knows that it's in a book.  the book knows that it's a book.  it also knows that it's about a house.  it's also about a poor sap named Johnny who is driven mad by - you guessed it - the book.  the same book you're reading.  you'll identify with him - trust me.  this book will frighten you.  but you wont put it down.

B000003S0B|4.0|Curious album, this. Listeners and critics disagree about King Crimson's second offering. Many call it a sub-standard copy of debut, Court of the Crimson King (1969); others, erm, didn't.<br />There are admittedly quite a lot of similarities between the tw o, both musically and stylistically. In fact each song on Court... has a sort of sibling on In The Wake of Poseidon, though I can’t possibly imagine why that should be seen as formulaic music making.<br />For King Crimson beginners, this particular incarnat ion of the group (Lake, McDonald, Giles, Fripp) was no-holds-barred, meat-and-potatoes progressive rock plain and simple: storybook lyrics, pompous orchestrations, classical influences and - just discernible - a smidgen of late 60s psy chadelia. Oh, and a lot of Mellotron. I love it. Most importantly the songwriting is for the most part, spot on. Cat Food and Cadence and Cascade are superb, while the title track is, like its counterpart Court of the Crimson King, a glorious piece of work (they REALLY don't make them like that anymore). It's Side 2 which taxes some listeners' patience to breaking point. An instrumental 5-part epic track the Devil's Triangle is modelled on the theme from Holst's Planets (Mars), and it rocks big-time. A great, dark, brooding drama depicting scenes of a scale limited only by your imagination. And there’s quiet, gentle bits, too, to restore sanity and give you the chance to wipe the sweat and froth from your anguished, contorted features.<br />To sum up, Wake of Poseidon may not have had the commercial impact of its predecessor but it’s an album with bucketloads of personality and ye-olde-curiosity-shoppe charm. The music’s quite good, too..
B00004Y6NP|5.0|This is one of the few albums I purchased in the 80's that I still listen to. Of the 3 famous songs, 2 of them (&quot;Walk of Life&quot; and &quot;So Far Away&quot;) aren't even as good as the rest of the CD. It's the non-hits that make this CD so good. &quot;Your Latest Trick&quot;, &quot;Why Worry&quot;, &quot;The Man's Too Strong&quot; (amazing guitar work), and the title track are all spectacular. The only track that doesn't quite measure up is &quot;One World&quot; - it just doesn't have much identity. But the rest of the CD makes up for it. Pass on their greatest hits CD and just get this one - it's better.
0553208845|4.0|Gotama Buddha's original name was Siddhartha, so it would have been better to use some other name for this book and for the Samana who followed his own soul.<br />One very valuable learning from this book is that no teaching can substitute the process of 'learning'.

I understand Rebecca Bloomwood's passion for non-stop shopping. Becky is hillarious, passionate and witty. It's a light, easy read that will have you smiling and laughing out loud. She's a financial journalist with a shopping habit. You will love the book and will want to read more (&quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot; is fantastic too!). I'm definitely passing it on to my girlfriends. Keep writing about Becky, Sophie. I can't wait to read your latest book in March 2003!

B000009EAD|4.0|On a recent Saturday night around 2 A.M., I was zooming across the Pennsylvania border from Ohio for reasons I probably shouldn't get into here.  The closing trilogy from Iced Earth's Something Wicked This Way Comes was blasting from my stereo speakers.  Bleary eyed and exhausted from a long night of driving, I still couldn't help but be moved by the virtuosity of Iced Earth's classy power/thrash metal attack.  Banging my head and singing along, I ventured ever closer to the Steel City.<br />What's that?  You say Iced Earth are nothing more than Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Queensryche imitators?<br />I'm of half a mind to terminate this review right here.  With your callous comments about Iced Earth, you've managed to upset me and spoil my review-writing mood.  <br />Okay, I've taken a break to enjoy a meal at My Ngoc where I had the chance to relax and cool off.  I've thought about it and decided that I'm not going to let you get to me anymore.  I know I've said it before, but this time I really mean it.  However, for the record and for your benefit, let me state the following: Iced Earth are more than just derivative of their influences.  Sure they sound like they've been influenced by their musical predecessors, but name me one band that sounds like it has no influences.  Iced Earth use the inspiration provided by their musical heroes to create some of the highest quality power metal around.  Something Wicked This Way Comes is the sort of album I'd play with my metal-loving buddies over a couple of six-packs if I had any buddies who listened to metal and I didn't feel like I've been poisoned virtually every time I drink alcohol.<br />Something Wicked This Way Comes is one of those rare albums that peaks at the end.  I promise you, the closing 5 songs will leave you breathless and a little dizzy.  But just because the album closes so strongly doesn't mean you should skip right to the end.  No, there are some classic power metal cuts sprinkled throughout Side A aswell.  If you insist, I'll give you 3 examples: 1) \\"Melancholy\\" in which Michael Barlow wears his Geoff Tate influences on his sleeve to fine effect, 2) \\"Watching Over Me\\", a the touching paean to a fallen friend, and 3) \\"Consequences\\", the Holocaust history-lesson which features a brutal guitar solo that materializes out of nowhere and kicks you in the stomach.<br />The main weakness of this album is its excess of thrash-by-numbers cuts like \\"Burning Times\\", \\"Disciples of the Lie\\", and \\"Stand Alone\\" which will sound a bit tired to those of you with Anthrax albums in your collection.  However, even these thrash cuts are nothing worse than mediocre while most of the remainder of the album is nothing short of brilliant.  The operatic vocals and Metallica and Iron Maiden style guitar pyrotechnics provide a timeless quality to the album.  Something Wicked This Way Comes was released in 1998, but after listening to it, you'd probably believe me if I told you it came out in 1988 instead.  Simply put, this is the sort of metal that never goes out of style - epic power metal played with conviction.  It's comforting to me to know that someone in the U.S.A. still has the guts to play it.<br />Considering that the stellar cuts far outnumber the mediocre ones, this album comes pretty darn close to a 5-star rating.  It is the kind of album that reminds you time and again why you love metal.
B00005JKCH|5.0|The one great thing about Spider-Man is that he is the only superhero that can be real.  And now the film does justice to hardcore comic fans, non-comic fans, and people that complain too much about how fake superheroes are.  Sam Raimi's adaptation to the Marvel Comics classic is done right for a change.  With an update to Visual Effects, two minor changes (webbing coming from himself, and Green Goblin's metal costume), a great nerdy-type actor Tobey Maguire, a scary villian Willem Defoe, and the teenage angst story, you got one great adaptation that's as close to the comics than ever.  Others have failed before, such as The Punisher (Dolph Lungren with no skull on chest), Captain America (Unknown actor Matt Salinger as skinny Cap with Red Skull as an Italian guy instead of the original German Nazi villian he was), The ill-fated Fantastic Four movie (which will NEVER be released, yet you can find bootlegs on the web and in small video stores), and the terrible Batman and Robin film which eventually destroyed the Batman film Franchise.  <BR>Spider-Man is a great movie that belongs among the ranks of the 'better' superhero movies such as Superman I and II, Batman, Blade, X-Men, and Unbreakable.  With the superhero genre now in full force, Spider Man proved that it is safe to say that hopefully most if not all the hero films will stick to the original comic and not be ruined by studio execs with no idea how to make a superhero movie.
0380002930|5.0|People look at me funny when I tell them that Watership Down, a book about rabbits, was the greatest book I've ever read (I've read it 4 times, the first time when I was in the 8th grade).  In most cases, people refuse to believe me, so I buy the skeptic a copy.  In virtually every case, the skeptic returns and admits that Watership Down was the best book they ever read.  The book is simply fantastic from the first to the last page.  When my wife read it, she would only read about 5 pages at a time of the last 25 or so because she didn't want it to end. It is that good.  From the start your sucked into the world of rabbits and their struggles to survive against humans, natural predators, and themselves.  The parallels with real world fascism, evil dictators, and the quest for true freedom is all too real.  The last 100 pages will have you reading through the night with your heat pumping.  One of the most engrossing, fantastic stories you will ever encounter. The writing is lush and superb. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, it certainly deserves it.
1586210912|2.0|This book seems to be the most controversial financial book ever written by far. I read it while back, and to be fair, I will go back and read it again (along with Cashflow Quadrant, the other Kiyosaki book I've read) and see what I may have missed the first time. Honestly though, I'm not expecting any revelations. Many people who give this book negative reviews are criticized as being &quot;narrow minded&quot; and unwilling or unable to think differently about money, holding a job etc. Actually, in my instance, that is not the case, however I still need to find some value in something before I can recommend it. My complaint, like many other people is that this book has really no substance (IMHO). It is essentially a motivational book and while I agree one must get motivated to succeed, motivation alone is not enough. As I read somewhere, have you ever attended a rousing motivational lecture, got excited, but 5 minutes after the seminar was over asked yourself, &quot;that was great, now what the hell do I do?&quot;. <br />Mr. Kiyosaki doesn't elaborate on ANYTHING (and in some instances seems to contradict himself as well). A few examples:<br />1. He continually mentions building up your asset column and one asset he recomends is stocks. Though I wasn't expecting a specific list of stocks to buy, someone who claims to have so much knowledge might have wrote a bit about HOW he evaluates companies, what he looks for when he considers buying a stock etc.<br />2. He continually mentions how your home is not an asset. So what is his point, don't buy a home? Since you have to live somewhere you can either buy, rent, or pitch a tent in your friends backyard. I don't consider renting or camping out building up my assets column either. So what do you recommend Robert? <br />3. Become financially literate. This is repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated and...well, you get the idea. Must be important. OK, so what actually makes one financially literate? I mean what specifically should one know? Once you know the difference between a stock and a bond are you financially literate? Once you know how to calculate a  P/E ratio? Please tell me Robert?<br />4. He mentions Cashflow as being the most important thing in escaping the rat race. I don't hear much explanation about what specific assets produce cashflow except a bit that he mentions about real-estate ( and again, no &quot;How To&quot;). Stocks are definitely assets but how do they produce cashflow until you sell them (unless you have an exceptionally large number of shares in very high dividend paying companies).<br />Anyway, no need to go on, I think you get the point. I don't want to be so critical, believe me, I'd really like to read this book over and all of a sudden have something click and say &quot;thats it&quot;, now I see his point, but like I said, when your this vague maybe there isn't much point. <br />One other note, as of this writing, Mr. Kiyosaki has published at least 5 (maybe 6) books in this series. Couldn't he have said all that needed to be said in one longer book, or at the most two longer books. Probably, but it seems to be much more profitible pumping out a new book every six months or so and keeping readers coming back hoping to find the information that should have already been provided. I can't help but think Mr. Kiyosaki is a bit of a con artist as he is now on the infomercial circuit as well. <br />If you think I'm just being negative, do a search on Robert Kiyosaki and John T. Reed and take a look at his (John. T. Reeds) review of this book as well.

B00006F7S4|4.0|Many people think Mutations, is Becks finest work. Beck challenges that accusation with Sea Change. For a singer-songwriter like Beck, Sea Change is a gem. He composes stunning songs like \\"Paper Tiger\\" \\"The Golden Age\\" \\"Lost Cause\\" \\"Lonesome Tears\\" and \\"Sunday Sun.\\" Beck seems pretty depressed on this album though. In \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" he sings \\"It's only tears that i'm crying, it's only you that i'm loosing. Guess i'm doing fine.\\" Yet he pulls off the breathtaking symphonics of \\"Paper Tiger\\" with a backing guitar/symphony face-off. The highlight of the album is \\"Sunday Sun\\" with it's brilliant mellody that decomposes at the end with a breakdown that you'd think he borrowed from Thom Yorke. With the release of Beck's Sea Change, it could mark his Golden Age. 8.5/10 Highlights: \\"Paper Tiger\\" \\"Golden Age\\" \\"Sunday Sun\\" \\"Lost Cause\\"
6301247485|3.0|I have to start out by saying that I am very torn over what to rate this film. I want to like it, I really do, but I just can't seem to find all that much to like about the film. The sets/scenes and costumes were phenomenal, but I can't give a good rating based on that. I feel the major flaw in this movie was not the acting or casting (though I definitely have to comment on that later), it was the adaptation. I had already read the book a while ago, and it remains my favorite. However, for a school project we had to compare listening to a book on tape, to reading the book, so I chose The Great Gatsby. Having the words freshly in my mind, I also decided to try experiencing the story in the film medium. I've heard people praise the film for how close it was to the book, but I couldn't disagree more. Sure, it has the same gist to it, but everything is out of place. Dialogue is spoken in scenes far from where it was written, and many scene, especially in the beginning, were left out, which made me wonder how much a viewer who hasn't read the book could understand. <BR>   <BR>Now for the acting and casting reviews. First off, what were they thinking casting Bruce Dern as Tom?! I simply don't care if he acted the part well. It's just not right to stray that far from the author's obvious depiction of a character. He's a brute, upper-class polo player; not some sleazy used car salesman! I cringed when I first saw Dern as Tom. However, he did fine acting, so I have nothing against the actor, just the casting director. Next, the inevitable review of Mia Farrow's Dasiy. I have to quote my father on this one... \\"You look at Redford, and look at Farrow, and just think, nah... It wouldn't happen.\\" And I have to agree. There's no way Gatsby would have spent years pining after her, or the flat, shrill character she played Daisy as. Karen Black as Myrtle was fine I thought, though she varied from who I had pictured when I read the book, but that's a strictly personal thing. Whoeverit was that played Jordan, I can't seem to find her name, did a wonderful job. She was definitely not who I pictured in the role, but never the less she did well. I loved Redford as Gatsby, but who didn't. Last but not least, Sam Waterston or Waterston (which is it, could someone tell me, even the credits in the movie vary... it's Waterston it the beginning, Waterson in the end) was wonderful, delightful, and PERFECT as Nick Carraway. He was right on the money!<BR>   <BR>Lastly, I just have to throw in my comments about various symbols in the movie. Was it just me, or did the light at the end of Daisy's dock seem, well, just not as impressive as it did in the book. Maybe that's why it was shown so many darned times. Also, what on Earth was the director thinking with the sign of T.J. Eckleburg being shown so many times. You hear of it ONCE in the book, and I really don't get what he was going for with the eyes. Also, what happened to the owl-eyed man in the library and at the grave?! I thought that was an important part of the book, and something that meant a lot. <BR>   <BR>Overall, the movie is pretty good, but a horrible adaptation of the book if you ask me. I would rent it at least just to experience it, but don't expect too much.
B0000028VT|5.0|I bought this CD in 1994 after hearing &quot;Without You&quot; on the radio. Boy was i glad i got it! Mariah's voice soars to the sky on every song. My favourites are: Dreamlover, Hero, Music Box, Without You and All I've Ever Wanted. I got the the import which also includes a bonus track: Everything Fades Away, its one of Mariah's best ballads ever. Mariah's voice shines through this CD.
B00004Y62T|4.0|I'm one of those nostalgics who often claim things were done better and with more style in a long gone past I haven't experienced myself: the original Mini Cooper vs. the new one, publicity, design, music.... (Name me one song comparable to 2 minute-pearls such as &quot;Bus stop&quot; or &quot;No milk today&quot; made those last 5 years ???) Another of my prejudices is to think too often that modern American movies only excel in spfx and bold dialogs, while movies from the Old Continent stand for style and a more realistic and less bombastic approach. However, recently, I bought a copy of &quot;Plein soleil&quot; (VHS), a 1960 movie based upon the same Patricia Highsmith bestseller as &quot;The talented Mr. Ripley&quot;. With French superstar Alain Delon cast as Tom Ripley, understanable that my expectations were high while standing with my nose against the glass doors of the shelf in the second hand shop. Furthermore, the presence of singer Marie Laforet in the movie seemed to be an interesting bonus. Well, the 1999/US-version of &quot;The talented Mr. Ripley&quot; beats the French 1960-version in almost every way: a far better casting (f.i. Matt Damon: ideal mix of angelic looks and weird behaviour), locations and interiors with far more style... But THE argument why the remake definetely beats the original is the way in which it gradually builds towards its climax. This is done so well and subtle (slowly but NOT too slowly), that -according to me- this is one of the best movies in its kind of the 1990's.
B000002LBH|5.0|Well, what can I say? It's the Smiths. They are always good. Awesome lyrics, and dinstinctive, unimitable music. I love the Smiths...I really miss the Smiths. All tracks are WONDERFUL. The best tracks, the ones I play the most: Sweet and Tender Hooligan, Ask, Oscillate Wildly (oooooh, it's the best), Stretch out and Wait, Unloveable and the sad, haunting, beautiful Asleep.
B000003JDO|3.0|One of the most over rated albums in rock history. Not even Tull's best. I'll take &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;This Was&quot;, or &quot;Benefit&quot; over this. Some of the songs are quite good, &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; being one of my favroite Tull tunes.  However, I find the title track to be weak and lyrically trite.  This falls into the grand category of Led Zeppelin or Grateful Dead type ennui.
B000001OAA|5.0|Garbage rocks...good band, danceable music, fun to drive to, excellent to get energized and workout to. This band doesn't get enough attention and airplay. Treat yourself and buy this album. If they are featured on a tour near you...go see 'em. You won't be disappointed. I can't compare them to anyone musically but energy- wise they remind me of the Pixies...remember them?!
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is not an easy album to review. First, there are the opinions of the fans and the critics flying back and forth. Old Radiohead vs. new Radiohead. Radiohead with guitars vs. Radiohead without guitars. OK Computer vs. Kid A. Second, there is the English language's shortage of adjectives and descriptors that are a necessity when discussing an album of such breadth and scope. So, the question is, where to begin?<BR> As a followup to Radiohead's critics' darling (the sublime OK Computer), the band had the rather unenviable task of trying to top what many consider to be the absolute peak of guitar-based rock. So instead of trying to out-OK Computer OK Computer, they crafted an album that scarcely acknowledges its predecessor. Gone are the big, expansive guitar-scapes. Gone are Jonny Greenwood's slash-merry-hell-out-of-the-guitar 6-string solos. And (largely) absent are traditional verse-chorus-verse-chorus structures to the songs. <BR> The guitar only shows up on Kid A as one of many instruments, like one color out of many on an artist's palette, and when it does surface, it is often abstracted beyond recognition (on songs like The National Anthem, Treefingers, and Morning Bell). In place of the ever-present 6-strings of OK Computer, we have analog synths, filtered and processed Rhodes piano, cut-and-paste vocals, Charles Mingus-influenced jazz horns, gorgeously dissonant strings, harps, and harmoniums. In place of Jonny's endearingly abusive lead guitar work, we have him playing an instrument called an Ondes Martenot (a primitive synthesizer akin to a theremin) throughout much of the album. In place of verse-chorus dynamics, we have an album that flows beautifully from one track to the next, with an affecting cohesion that is rarely found in today's music. So where does all this leave us? With another Radiohead masterpiece. Fans and critics will no doubt continue to argue about whether OK Computer or Kid A is the best Radiohead album. Personally, my favorite is KidA. After a year and a half of owning it and listening to it, it still sounds fresh, and it still challenges and inspires me. Simply put, Kid A is seamless, uninterrupted brilliance from beginning to end. Admittedly, this is a \\"difficult\\" album. What it is not, however, is difficult for difficulty's sake. The payoff for taking the time to listen to it several times through, for letting it gradually reveal itself to you layer after layer, for letting go of your expectations about what Radiohead \\"should\\" sound like, is tremendous.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This is Madonna's best album ever. 1982 to 1985 Madonna's music ruled the clubs. I never get tired of playing this cassette. (Yes, you read it right, cassette). Unfortunately, beginning with Material Girl on into Like a Virgin Madonna just got bad, bad, bad. She became an uninteresting, lyrical-babble, pop icon. Nothing wrong with being an icon...but pop---ICK!<br />I'd better buy the Madonna CD before my tape breaks.
B00004YZFQ|5.0|Rock videos mean very little to me, but Gimme Shelter has a real story to tell. I always had a thing for intelligent horror movies, and this has to be one of the best. It actually resembles Lord of the Flies in the way it shows a crowd of civilised people gradually reverting to savagery; but it's even better because it's live footage of a real incident. <br />Recommended for people who enjoy A Clockwork Orange or Aguirre, The Wrath OF God.
B00005R23S|4.0|it still sends thrills upon my spine when I watch this DVD... Its simply marevellous.
B00003CXXS|1.0|Oh my god! This can't be happening! This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Let's look at why:<BR>1. The story- unbelievably pathetic. Sure, I understand why 2 worried parents go on the island to find their lost annoying son, but the way they all get out of the mess is so STUPID it made me wanna scream! I mean, a CELL PHONE!!?? How can a cell phone possibly get any reception on a deserted island full of dinosaurs?? Oh save the phone, it's our only hope! gag!!! <BR>2. The characters- Sam Niell looked through the entire movie as if he wanted nothing to do with it, and I can't blame him! After an amazing performance by all of his costars and him in the original, he's now teamed up with a group of the dumbest, whiniest people on the planet. They were all just SO STUPID! Not to mention the horrible acting! I mean, it did have a couple of decent big names, like Tea Leoni and William H. Macy, but even they didn't seem to look as if they were trying <BR>3. The Dinosaurs- the whole thing was amazing in the first, and still cool in the second, but by this time everything just got really old, and the writers trying to come up with something new like \\"thinking dinasaurs\\" was like something they pulled out of their [rear-ends] after a 5 minute meeting. <BR>4. The Ending- Oh my god! The end of this movie is like an angry Jack in the Box, it comes out of nowhere and slaps you right in the face saying \\"get out of here! We're done trying to entertain you!\\" <BR>Who wrote this movie??? I'd like to get a piece of that guy!...The last 2 Jurassic parks were at least 2 hours long, this one had a running time of about 1:30 min, blatently showing us there really was no script at all in this rushjob paycheck of a movie.
B00005QFHG|4.0|When this movie came out, I really wanted to see it.The location and actors are beautiful and well-chosen. The acting was high quality as well. <br />So with so much going for the movie, why was I disheartened by the ending? The charactor of the mayor is stilted. He is a moral man who loves his city, the city's people and feels strongly that he provides leadership through example. Having been left by his wife in a time when divorce was not available, he treads the higher moral ground by not speaking ill of his missing wife, and by not bedding a woman that clearly cares for him, in spite of the fact that he is still coming to terms with the loss. <br />Toward the end of the movie, the mayor is shown in the chocolate shop, rolling around in the chocolate. This seemed very inconsistent with a charactor who feels so strongly about morality. While some have suggested that this scene reveals the mayor's hypocrisy, I think that the makers of the movie lost their focus at this point. If they were trying to say that morality should not be equated with a joyless life,they did not show this in the chocolate-rolling scene. Frankly, the scene makes the mayor look crazy rather than open to new ideas. The makers of the movie would have done better to show morality being combined with the joys of life, instead of making those with morals into the \\"bad guys\\". In fact, after the mayor's \\"awakening\\", he is shown making friends with the woman who cares for him. However, it is appears he plans to just sleep with her rather than the movie's making a point that he is divorcing his wife so that he can move on from his loss,yet maintain his morality. As a result,the movie celebrates his fall from morality as a good thing. <br />So, the movie celebrates the single mother who is sleeping with a man she just met as a hero, and makes a fool of the man whose strongest desire is to live a moral life in spite of hardship. <BR>As a result, I walked away from this movie feeling cheated of the \\"feelgood\\" ending I expected and was disappointed in \\"if it feels good do it\\" moral of this story.
B00006JDVV|2.0|I was really excited about this one when I saw the previews for the movie in the theaters, I never got a chance to see it so I rented it when it came out. It's not very good.<BR>First off, the film is severly lacking in the action department. This is supposed to be an action movie, and when watching the previews you get the impression it's going to be a nonstop blast fest with the humans vs. dragons... it's not. Only 2 dragons die in the whole movie (one in the middle, one in the end) and these scenes are REALLY COOL, too bad they only last about 1 minute each. There is no real war between these 2 parties as I expected, although there could've been, and if there was this this still wouldn't be near oscar worthy but at least it'd be fun. <BR>Second, it's severely lacking in the characterization department. These people are just humans, and they must preserve the human race, but they're all like cardboard, no personalities, no conflicts, nothing! They just fight (hardly anyway), so any dialouge scenes just become completely uninteresting. <BR>There is only one redeeming quality in this movie, and it's the special effects, they truly kick [butt]. Unfortunately that's not enough for movie goers nowadays because we actually want action, a story, and good characters to go along with it. <BR>Give it a rent if you must, but you'll be dissappointed.
B000068OSK|1.0|These two know how to rock!  Blues inspired punk rock with a hint of the 60's.  A stripped down sound with great lyrics, some grit and intelligence.  After listening to all three albums, a progression in style and some polish result in a great line-up of albums that never stop keeping me interested.  It seems that whenever I have them on my car stereo, someone asks me \\"who is that?\\".
B00000255X|1.0|Very weak album by Dylan. Totally lost. only &quot;HURRICANE&quot; is great track, altough een this one is tediously, overwhelmingly long!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Most albums released these days contain the same old stuff that the last one had - some guy, angry with his parents or his girlfriend, singing amidst a lot of technical DJ record skips and sampled sounds.<br />Not on Audioslave. True to Rage Against the Machine form, Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, and Tim Commerford create an amazing backdrop of solid Rock to which Soundgarden's Chris Cornell adds his powerful, moving vocals. This CD is not a fake, there is no added bologne or polished twinkle on the edge of the music. This is raw rock and roll at it's best.<br />Listening to this CD, I felt that I was listening to something different - and that doesn't happen very often these days. I would recommend this CD to anyone who gets tired of listening to DJs and MCs mixed into their rock music - or any fan in general! It's incredible and not in the same style as, but right up there with a few of this years other fantastic releases: Silverchair's Diorama and Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head. Go out and get this CD today!
B00003CXZ4|1.0|HEre we go. THings are funny sometimes. Only because a director chose to tell the history BACKWARDS, people say it´s a masterpiece!! Go figure why!!<br />This is a silly movie, witha lot of bad taste, with an evils kin around it. Pearce´s character is obnoxious, as almost most characters he plays. THere´s absolutely no dificult to follow the backwards plot, it´s just annoying. Blergh!
B000075BFK|4.0|With the debut of \\"Better Dayz\\", there was a ton of criticism revolving around the mixing in of vocals from various artists.  these r artists 2pac would not have recorded a track or even mixed and mingled with in the public.  Nas was the main vocal point of pac fans that knew his relationship with the rapper was not a friendly one.  this was obviously illustrated in prolific track, Bomb First, from his sixth album Makaveli-the 7 day theory.  I 2 had my doubts, but made a promise 2 myself 2 push the skip button on my cd player whenever the track that featured Nas came on.  The first cd features many songs that sound generic, clearly displaying the work of a producer that laced pac's vocals with beats that we r not acustomed 2.  many of the tracks have have been rendered but seem 2 feel more like tampered, bcuz the originals were so much better.  I give the 2nd cd props, with the selection of tracks that were prsented.  they sounded fresh, especially with the fact that many featured only pac and the outlaws, instead of all these other fake marks.  i give it a thumbs up, but not a classic, only 4 the fact that i knew it would have been better prduced and orchastrated if pac made it.  better producers and features is basically wat it would have consisted of, example daz, dre, johnny \\"j\\", digital undergroung and many others.
B000066NW0|5.0|On most reviews i have read on here, they say that Avrils cd 'let go' is rubbish. but i personally think it is very good, at least she writes her own songs and doesnt just sing along to back ground music like kylie etc. she actually plays the guitar in a lot of the songs too (in her live gigs). I know that not every one likes her but thats the same with everyone, not everyone likes robbie williams.<br />so i think it is a good buy if that is the kind of music you are into.
B00005JLF5|5.0|YES! Considering TNN reruns Next Gen to death and other syndicated channels do the same with the disappointing Voyager, and Enterprise is just a rehash mostly of what went before, I'm so happy that DS9 is finally coming out on DVD. It truly is the best series trek ever did and although it started out slow, it is the only trek to ever get better and better and better with each and every season. By the fifth season, it was already the best trek ever and it got even better in the sixth! It was gutsy, innovative and the only series where you ended up really liking and caring for every member of the cast as opposed to three or four tops. This was the series that more and more, went where no one had gone before. -Rick
B00001OH7J|5.0|It's hard to describe a work of this magnitude without resorting to hyperbole. This, along with the follow-up album Top Priority, was the finest hour of one of the great musicians in blues/rock history. For anyone who is unfamiliar with the man's music it's a perfect place to start. For those who love his music but know little about the man, check out Dan Muise's book on Rory (plus Marriott, Derringer & Trower). It provides great insight into the sorrow that seems to have fuelled much of the songwriting. The book implies that Rory had a heartbreak in his life that he never fully recovered from. You can hear and feel the pain in songs like 'Overnight Bag' and 'Fuel to the Fire'. But there is also a lot of energy and joy to be found here, like on 'Shin Kicker' and 'Brute Force and Ignorance'. As for the guitar playing, it is nothing short of incredible. Gallagher was one of those who prove that when you have complete command of the instrument, you don't have to play at 200 MPH to be thrilling. His solos can take you to faraway places in your heart & mind. I know, I know, the hyperbole. But listening is believing.
0440219078|5.0|Everyone talks about how they want a \\"perfect world.\\" The Giver centers around just that. But, it isn't what you think it is. This \\"perfect world\\" is nothing more than a prison where conformity is the golden rule. I happen to like the ending. It give room for you to think, instead of forcing on an ending to such a mind-boggling thing. There is an article out where the author, Lois Lowry, explans why her ending is like it is. She wanted people to form their own ideas and if she had given a definite one, there wouldn't be discussions about it. About writing a sequel: She feels that since some people feel that Jonas dies on the hill (there's this stage before you freeze to death that you see things and fall into a dreamlike state). There wouldn't be a sequal because he's dead. Btw, I'm one of those people that feel Jonas dies. It just seems like a tragic ending and you just gotta love those. And it's the only one that seems realistic to the story.

B00003CXCK|5.0|Schinlder's List is the only movie I have ever seen in a theater where everyone there didn't move during the movie and stayed through the credits. The movie is so moving and powerful words can't do it justice. Spielberg for all of his great movies: Jaws, Close Encounters, Raider's, ET ect. None compare with the masterpiece that is Schilder's List. Not even Saving Privite Ryan, while being as powerful, the movie doesn't hold together as well as Schinder's List. Spielberg threw his heart and soul in this movie and you can tell. The Holocaust is one of the most tragic events in human history, and no movie can ever relate the horror of what happened. But in Schindler's List Spielberg comes as close as one can. The film is shot in Poland on some of the actual sights the real events happened. The true story of how a German businessman/war profiteer saved over 1100 Jews in WWII. With great performances by Liam Leeson, Ben Kingsley and a truely horrifying performance by Ralph Fiennes. This movie tells a story of the power of the human spirit.

630438551X|2.0|I watched this film in English class in addition to the Zefferelli version, which I can reccommend much more. At least see it, or read the play, before you see this. This would be a really cool, artsy film. However, Lhurmann tries too hard to be prolific, when he doesn't realize that the story itself is prolific enough.<br />For those of you who already know the play: The Capulets are decked out in leather and spurs, while the Montagues wear hawaiian shirts, that, for the most part, stay unbuttoned throughout the film. That's one bit of advice I might add: Keep your shirts on. Also, the opening sequences, indeed, everything till about the balcony scene, is cluttered, crazy, and hard to follow, unless you already know the sequence of events pretty well. Once everything calms down, you can really enjoy the symbolism of the film.<br />Also: A few characterization problems: In the play, Benvolio is more of a peacemaker. That seems to be forgotten in this film. Also, making Mercutio into a drag queen was just too much. It means nothing to the actual development of the plot, it's just there for...I'm trying to decide between entertainment and further confusion, so I don't really have an answer to that right now.<br />In conclusion, whether you're a shakespeare person, or a movie person, you'll find that this film, though the idea has good potential, was executed in a way that was, perhaps, just a bit too over the top to make it good.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I bought this CD wary that it might be smooth jazz.  But I was wrong; in fact, it is not jazz at all.  The only thing jazz-like about this cd is that Blue Note issued it.

0151008116|5.0|A boy, a tiger, and the ocean. Let me tell you the true story of how this book led me to a very strange discovery. <br />I found it in the living room of a friend, when my wife and I were over for his birthday dinner. I have never been a very social person, so while the others were chatting around the fireplace, I started reading Martel's novel. I felt so transposed to a different land, something inside me was awakening to an intensity I did not remember having experienced ever before, and I had to restrain myself from shouting to the group that they should stop their chat and listen to what I would read to them. But then I didn't. I did, however, take &quot;The Life of Pi&quot;, of which by then I had already read close to two hundred (of the about three hundred and fifty) pages, home when the evening was over.<br />The next morning - I swear - my highschool sweetheart, whom I had not seen in 11 years, stood in front of my door, holding a copy of &quot;The Story of Pi&quot; for me. &quot;You have to read this&quot;, she said. She had read it herself, and from the scene early in the book where the boy meets his mother on an island, in a very irrational way - because there is no story linking myself or my mother to an island - she could not stop thinking of me. I invited her in, but she had to go, and she said it would be better if I didn't know her address. In the nights that followed, my dreams were filled with scenes of the book, of the tiger that teaches the boy how to love, of the seagull that whispers to him in a woman's voice, and of the band that plays on the other side of the ocean, its songs carried over the water at night.<BR>One week later, I got a note from my ex-girlfriend's (the highschool sweetheart's) sister, informing me that Aline had died in a taffic accident, and that I was included in her will.<BR>Needless to say, I was profoundly sad and shocked.<BR>When the will was read to me, I learned that she had left me her tropical getaway, a rudimentaryhut on a pristine beach in southern Sri Lanka. During this year's summer vacation, my wife and I flew there. In the hut, which was looked after by a boy from the fishing village nearby, we found a toy stuffed tiger, as well as an envelope. The postage stamp on the sealed envelope was October 9th, 1961. Inside, there was a note saying that my wife and I (she was mentioned by her maiden name) would stand in this hut near this beach on this day.<BR>Call me at (604) 933-8787 if you don't believe this story.
0151008116|3.0|Okay, first I must say, this book reminded me of my younger years...when I always seemed to be confused and lost in this big world. Never knowing who to turn to for help, until I found religion. The 60's were the best time to live, everything was free (much like this book was to me)...and the Acid, oh the 'cid. It was my saviour!<br />I guess this is why I related to this book so well, it's like the author was reading my mind during the 60's, taking notes as I experienced life...either that or Martel was stoned and hallucinating in a basement somewhere when writing this book.<br />Pi, the main character, is a pretty sweet little kid, sitting in a lifeboat with a bloody tiger. A TIGER! Who would have thought of that?<br />As Pi and the tiger travel across the ocean, they experience a multitude of assinine adventures and realizations. None more blatantly crude than the bludgeoning death of the poor Zebra for the simple, sarcastic comment \\"eat me\\".<br />I would recommend this book if you are seeking to revive your glory days with your drug of choice, however, if you are expecting to read this book and actually finish it without puking, I'd suggest taking Gravol at regular intervals.
6304711905|5.0|To say Tombstone is a great western is not at all to do the movie justice.  To say Tombstone is unbelievably good is to trammel it down in the muck.  What you've got to do is grab each person you know by the lapels and shake them back and forth while screaming in their face that they absolutely must see this film.  Friends don't let friends not see Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday - easily the most inspired character in all of fiction.  I will stack Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday up against any other character that has ever been created by an artist.  He will win.  Hamlet?  Come off it love.  Who do you think you're fooling with this Shakespeare routine?  Certainly not me and probably not even yourself, as you yawn and scratch your way through yet another &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  Why don't you make a clean slate of it and just admit to yourself finally that Shakespeare bores the crud out of you and his plays are irritating beyond belief?  But Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday... now THERE'S literature!  Stack him up against Hamlet and he'll blow his brains out with his ivory handled revolvers.  And as Hamlet gags and sputters and reels and staggers Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday will yell, &quot;C'mown, Johnny, C'MOWN!&quot;  And he will advance solicitously, full of adroit concern as Hamlet collapses, saying, &quot;Oh you're no daisy.  You're no daisy atall!&quot;

B00005JL96|5.0|I won't bore you with yet another summary of the movie itself - even if you haven't seen it, you're probably familiar enough with the plot from numerous Disney adds in the past year, and if you're not, there are (as of this writing) 160 other reviews that will undoubtedly break the plot down for you.  Instead, I want to look at the DVD itself and the type of movie (and DVD) Disney has made here.<br />First of all, the DVD is excellent - the picture and sound are wonderful and the extras for both adults and kids are surprisingly good.  For kids, the main extras are a \\"DisneyPedia\\" of Hawaii - a focus on the six biggest islands of the chain with a talk about various aspects of Hawaiian culture and nature prominent for each island, the \\"Create Your Own Experiment Game\\" - essentially a quiz on the movie narrated by David Ogden Steir's Jumba, a faux \\"Stitch Through the Years\\" documentary, and the \\"I Can't Help Falling in Love With You\\" music video, as well as the usual DVD-ROM links.  It's not jam-packed, but it's pretty decent for something that's on one disc and doesn't have \\"Special Edition\\" stamped across it in big, bold letters.  For adults, there are behind-the-scenes documentaries on the making of the film, the Hawaiian music from Kamehameha Schools, animating the hula and a half-and-half music video/behind-the-scenes look at Wynonna Judd's rendition of \\"Burning Love\\".  There are also half-finished deleted and alternate scenes (three in all, with lead-in commentary) and (my personal favorite) the four \\"Stitch Invades Other Disney Movies\\" teaser trailers.  When put together, it makes for a really excellent DVD on Disney's part.<br />As for the movie itself, it's the best one they've done since at least \\"Pocahontas\\" and probably since \\"Aladdin\\" - it's got an excellent offbeat humor to it, it hits the right moral notes without descending into preachiness.  Likewise, it shows Hawai'i surprisingly effectively.  By having all the action on Kaua'i (the next island northwest from O'ahu) and The Big Island, they bypass Honolulu and much of the touristiness of the islands (although they do give tourists the occasional sardonic nod) in favor of the color, diversity and open acceptance that Hawai'i is, more often than not, known for.  Likewise, while staying firmly rooted in the silly, it strikes a very impressive balance between care and humor that seems to be harder to find with each passing year's new Disney movie.<br />I really can't recommend this DVD enough.  Along with the quality of the movie itself, it's got a really impressive slew of extras.  Hopefully Disney can take a message from this movie that you don't need to threaten a limited shelf-life, plaster words like \\"Uber-Diamond Edition\\" across the packaging, or stick it in a limited edition tin to sell a good product.  Whether or not you've seen it, it's worth owning, and - for the price - it's the best DVD Disney's done so far.
B00006CXXW|5.0|At first, before I bought this CD, I thought it was just going to be like the other pop artists who completely changed their image because they didn't want to have the 'bubble-gum pop' shadow on them. Christina's album isnt poppy, but it isn't such a drastic change that we can't recognize the sweet, soulful singer with great hits like \\"I Turn to You\\" and \\"Come on Over\\".<BR>(Instead of listing ALL the songs, I'm just going to list my favorite ones)<br />1)Stripped: I thought this was a good introduction to her CD. I thought she was like what the people on the track were saying about her, but after listening to all her songs, I realize that she was overlooked and judged by people who didn't know her.<BR>2)Can't Hold Us Down: This is a good song - I love the beat. She really gets the point across and I agree with what she's saying!<BR>3)Walk Away: This is an okay song, very jazzy and soulful.<BR>4)Fighter: This is a little different from the other songs, its more rocky and the beat just makes my head automatically go with it!<BR>5)Infatuation/Primer Amor: I'm taking Spanish, but not enough to understand what she was saying in Primer Amor. Infatuation is a nice song with a good beat. Can't help to think that she's talking about her ex Jorge..<BR>6)Impossible: With Alecia Keys playing the piano.. it's a nice jazzy song. A lot of the songs on this CD are jazzy.<BR>7)Beautiful: This is a truly beautiful song and one of my favorites. When I listen to it, I feel what the chorus says. \\"I am beautiful no matter what they say/Words can't bring me down.\\"<BR>8)Cruz: Nice song, good acapella in the beginning.<BR>9)The Voice Within: THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE WHOLE CD.. it is so touching and beautiful. I listened to it while looking at the stars one night..and i was so moved by the lyrics.<BR>10)Stripped pt.2: This is a good truthful piece. It's a continuation, and it also made me realize how many people misjudge her. It made me respect who she is.<BR>THE OTHER SONGS ARE ALL REALLY GOOD TOO - THESE ARE JUST MY FAVORITES! SO GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have not enjoyed an album so much since Marshall Crenshaws' first album about 20 years ago. He is an excellent wordsmith and has created terrfic hooks to make each song memorable almost immediately. I used to buy a ton of CD's, but with great digital music channels on cable I hardly do any more. I am glad I got this one. There are at least 5 singles that could be released off this disc, I hope radio gives him a chance. Marshall's first album had the hit &quot;Someday Someway&quot; you will know, but many more could have been a big hit too if he got the chance. I hope John is around a long time.
B000065V41|5.0|You would have to have the heart of a Scrooge to not enjoy this DVD! They did a masterful job at presenting the well-known story in a format that would be fun for kids and yet appealing to adults too. Some of the sly humor will go right over your kids' heads, but will make you laugh! This is really quite fun, and has become a traditional favorite in our household for holiday viewing.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I have just read all the reviews and I could not agree more, DS9 is the best Trek ever.  Without DS9, there is no solid \\"back-story\\" for all the Trek that has followed including Voyager and the movies.<br />Aside from great comedy and pathos, I LOVE the episodes with Quark and all the Ferengi, DS9 is the the most relevant series to today's world.  It deals honestly about war and terrorism and freedom.  <br />I read this in a Trek mag about 1 year ago, someone wrote in to point out a scene in one of later seasons-- 6 or 7, I think --where they have been testing people's blood to see if they are shapeshifters, and it gets to be a real impact on people's freedom.  And Sikso is advocating to stop this and says something like-- they may want to destroy our world, but we don't have to help them.<br />Anyway, now that season 1 is out and I've pre-ordered, I recommend that everyone who is interested in DS9 to see it from the beginning to really appreciate it.  My son who is 13 and has seen (almost) every episode of TNG and Voyager, missed out on DS9 and I can't wait for him to see it all.  <br />If we don't show a big push for DS9, Paramount might think it is not worth it to release them all-- So I say, show your support up front-- BUY SEASON 1 NOW!
B000002U82|5.0|When I first heard Dark Side of the Moon, it sounded like the most creative, inspired, fresh piece of music I had ever heard. <br />What makes this observation amazing is that I did not encounter the album until the mid 1990s,  some 20 years after its original release. <br />The durability and timelessness of this album is a testament to its awesome power and beauty.  Listen to any other piece of music from the early 70s and then listen to this album; there is absolutely no comparison. With the exception of one or two brief moments, none of the sounds on this CD are in any way dated or tired.  I have no doubt that DSOTM will be attracting new young listeners in another 30 years as well.<br />If you are put off of DSOTM by some of the Floyd's other, lesser works, don't be.  Their other albums range from unlistenably awful to very good, but none of them before or since can touch DSOTM.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo & Stitch is quickly becoming one of my favorite movies.  It will undoubtedly gain popularity as I'm sure straight to DVD/VHS movies will follow and I can't wait.  This is so much fun for everyone in the whole family.  Heck, I'm 22 years old and I love it.<br />The music is probably my favorite thing about it.  Not only is Lilo a virtual Elvis Presly expert, but it's perfect that the home of \\"Blue Hawaii\\" be the setting.  The songs are some of his best and they are superbly woven into the story.  I love the island music and the accurate and respectful treatment of of the legendary hula dance.  It is so much fun to hear this toe tapping music with infectious rhythms.  I have the soundtrack and it is ESSENTIAL summer music.  I love cranking up Hawaiian Roller Coster Ride and rolling down all the windows.<br />The voices are perfect.  Daveigh Chase is so adorable.  Tia Carrere is the perfect voice to put to Nani, they're practically twins.  Jason Scott Lee is great as David.  His character and Jason's voice go together like pieces of a puzzle.  Kevin McDonald as Pleakly is hilarious.  I loved him on The Kids In The Hall and I love him even more as that goofy alien.  David Ogden Stiers is stellar in the role of Jumba.  He is a big cuddly alien, though evil genius he may be, but he's so funny, especially when Stitch is \\"very persuasive.\\"  Finally, who else could you hear as Cobra Bubbles than Ving Rhames after seeing him on screen.  <br />The water colors for background and just about everything is so fitting with the setting in Hawaii.  The sky is so beautiful and it's just like looking at a great big painting, an ever changing always moving painting.  This could easily have been made digital as is every other animated movie today.  But thankfully, the rounded characters and the all hand drawn and water color utilization is a nice throwback to the classic cartoons of old.<br />The extra features are great and plentiful.  The explanations for deleted scenes is nice.The create your own alien game is fun even for someone twenty two like me.  The learning to hula featurette is very interesting and enlightening.  The sing along with Wynona and A-Teens featurette and video are fun.  I love the mock trailers with recent Disney films and the \\"Stitch Through the Years\\" is cute.  This is an excellent DVD if you are a fan of getting lots of bonus features with your purchase.<br />The story is great.  It's full of comedy and action and adventure and drama and suspense and romance thought the end looks bleek for Stitch and Ohana, it has a very happy ending that everyone can enjoy.  It is the most original and unconventional Disney film since Toy Story.  It's characers are lovable and memorable.  The music is great.  The picture is great.  The voices makes sense with their characters.  I love this movie and give it my highest recommendation.  It is appealing to young and old, sense of humor or not, lovers of animation or science fiction.  Stitch is going to be the next great enduring Disney character you won't be able to get away from.  Once again, this, one of my favorite films, one of the most entertaining and enjoyable for the whole family in A LONG TIME, get's my highest possible recommendation.
B000069HK2|5.0|I have never listened to a CD for as long as this one without getting sick of it.  I bought this CD in July and it is still the only CD I have been able to listen to all the way through since.  I am still showing it to everyone I know.  <br />I saw them live at the Paramount in Seattle when they opened for Box Car Racer and H2O.  Aside from sounding amazing (even better sounding than on The Warped Tour and Ozzfest), the crowd put a 4 foot hole in the floor during &quot;Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; because they were jumping so hard.  The Used had to stop their set after 5 songs.<br />Trust Me.  <br />Buy this album...and then go see them live.
B00006GFAB|5.0|The only word that I can say is: BUY IT!!...
B00005K9QP|5.0|For those of you who really want to hear the early works of Eric Clapton, than this is the album to purchase. &quot;All Your Love I Miss Loving&quot; is a classic which helped catapult this guitarist into rock-god status. This ablbum will help listeners understand the driving force behind clapton - blues.
0517118297|4.0|I love Jane Austen and of course all the novels contained in this set are fantastic.  However, if you really love Jane Austen I recommend just getting your favorite novels separately.  This book is so large and unwieldy that I kept having to quit reading because the only comfortable way to read it is if you are not holding it up.  It's kind of a pain, to be honest.  But content and price-wise, this is a great collection.
0679777547|5.0|This outstanding novel is neither high literature, nor a cheap dime-store paperback. But there are times in consuming this book you would swear you were reading both. Far from the current climate of overdone and overly dramatic (read: depressing) \\"serious\\" novels of the day, this book is full of action, intrigue and mystery without ever sinking to the pedantic plot twists that let the reader know the author is hoping he (or she) is writing the next blockbuster movie script. It is a book for lovers of books and it is spectacular. <BR>   Lucas Corso is an odd and refreshing protagonist as he is something of a (literal) literary mercenary both as a dealer of rare books and an authenticator of manuscripts. Early in the novel he finds himself in the possession of an original chapter of Dumas' Three Musketeers at around the same time he is commissioned by a patron to verify the authenticity of one of only three copies of an occult tome entitled \\"The Book of the Nine Doors\\" which is purported to have the power to summon the Devil himself. Both pieces begin him on a quest for which he is not prepared (and which he often resents) full of mystery and murder and intrigue and things that go bump in the night. Corso scowls his way from clue to clue, trying desperately to finish his quest and return his life to its pragmatic norm all the while being sucked further and further into a dark and alarming world that spirals out of all control. It makes the very good point that the man (or woman) who quietly appreciates a novel like \\"The Three Musketeers\\" from the comfort of their living room may very well resent having to live that adventure out in everyday life.<BR>   Steeped in literary tradition and reference, this book is a treat not to be missed. Blending elements of Dumas, Doyle, Christie, Eco, Rice and a generous heaping of originality and wit, it is an \\"old school\\" book that makes you seriously miss the old school (and makes you wonder why you have wasted your time with the trite flavor of the month). It is smart, it is fun and just when you think things have wound down to a satisfying conclusion, it socks you with things you have forgotten and becomes grand. The last page had me howling out loud and putting this book on my \\"must re-read forever\\" list. It will certainly have you hunting up more books by Arturo Perez-Reverte.<BR>   As a quick aside (and since I mentioned movies in the opening paragraph), this book HAS been made into a movie by Roman Polanski entitled \\"The Ninth Gate\\" staring Johnny Depp (the books cover copy tells you so). Skip it. It is a disappointing travesty that little resembles its source material. I was offended by its banality and wished I could recover the two hours of my life I spent watching it.<BR>   But this is, as always, simply my opinion.
B00006ALGL|5.0|it`s very simple, you like the new Beck??<BR>you like such artists like Nick Drake, John Mayer, Duncan Sheik, Tim &amp; Jeff Buckley, The Counting Crows, Bob Dylan?<BR>Then this one`s for you.<BR>It`s simple but beautiful.<BR>Acoustic Folk.<BR>Well written Lyrics, great Voices (both Damien &amp; Lisa) and ten absolutley lovley songs.<br />my advise: buy it now and even order a second copy if your first gets destroyed by overplaying.
B00000I8UF|5.0|This is so good and I highly recommend it to anyone including those who are just beginning to get into jazz. Art Blakey's drumming on this CD drives the rythym very forcefully on every cut. The trumpet playing of Lee Morgan from the very first notes on the very first tune will grab you. The guy was just magnificent in these sessions. I've become a big fan of Lee Morgan from listening to this as well as THE BIG BEAT by the messengers. He is an absolutely astonishing improvisor with a beautiful tone. All the players on this set are in top form This and THE BIG BEAT are my favorite sets by the Messengers and This lineup just cooks..Check it out.
B00005JL2O|5.0|I've seen the other two Austin Powers movies, and though I thought they were fine fun, I have to say I got the most enjoyment out of Goldmember, Austin's third installment of the 007 spoofs. Sure, the title character Goldmember (of course, played by Mike Myers) is not that entertaining, and I was not all that impressed by Beyonce Knowles' movie debut, but there are so many other things to enjoy about this movie, including, of course, Mini-Me, who really takes an emotional beating in this one; and many surprise cameos from famous celebs (the opening sequence was just great, but the Osbourne cameo later on just made me want to scream). This is slap-stick comedy at its best. Sure, it uses some of the same jokes, and sure it has some potty humor to appeal to the younger crowd, but it's all great fun. I didn't think it was possible, but this is a film franchise that doesn't seem to get worse with each movie - in fact, I think this is the best one out of the lot. I went to see this film two times at the theater, and at 8 bucks a ticket, I don't do that too often these days. And I laughed just as hard the second time I saw it. If you like Austin Powers at all, you've got to own Goldmember. It's groovy, baby.
0451207521|2.0|I was so excited about getting this book after reading so many wonderful reviews, but I found it so hard to finish.   I read 2-4 books a week, and I have to admit once I put this book down, I could not remember one thing notable about it.  Use your valuable time reading something more interesting!
6300267881|5.0|Just go see it. THE SCARIEST FREAKING MOVIE EVER MADE, AND THAT'S THE FINAL WORD!!...
B00000HZHS|4.0|Nirvana came out of nowhere when 'Nevermind' took over Michael Jackson to be the #1 band in the world. 'Nevermind showed the world that you could be a hard rock band; and still make pop records with this vagrant energy that would not scare away hard rock fans. You could say that 'Nevermind is Nirvana's 'Revolver'. <br />If 'Nevermind' is Nirvana's 'Revolver'; the 'In Utero' is their 'White Album'. Just like the Beatles; Nirvana wanted to change their sound; but unlike the Beatles, nirvana seemed like they wanted to scare away theur pop-punk audience when they released their landmark record 'In Utero'. The first song on the recod contains the line; 'teenage angst has paid off well/now i'm bored and old'. remarkable; for it always seemed to me that Nirvana were sort of turned off by their success; and that they sort of saw it as funny. <br />Think of it; 3 guys who grew up in a dismal town in nowhere, USA; get together; form a punk rock band; mix it with a sense of pop; get signed to majors; sell over 10 milion records, and they are turned off by it. So they change. And that change is 'In Utero'<br />The record has a sense of power an angst that was not touched on in the same sense on 'Nevermind'; with more distorted guitars, avant-garde lyrics and sure power. Key tracks on this record include: 'Heart Shaped Box, 'Dumb', 'Frances Farmaer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle', 'All Apologies', and the amazing 'Tourettes'which is the hardest Nirvana song with no real lyrics since tourettes is a disease that causes uncontrolable noises to come from the person who has the disease. This is a record with sure genius quality to it; a harder record than 'Nevermind' but arguably better.
6303114946|5.0|This is one of the greatest, and most popular movies you can find. Although it's about 10 years old it's great. Some parts of it are even humorous, and most parts are exciting, from the part where Josh Waitzkin, (Max Pomeranc) starts getting taught by Bruce Pandolfini, (Ben Kingsley) to when he competes for the nationals. One other thing: I have no idea why this movie is rated PG. Anyone can watch, and love it. Along with Monsters, Inc. and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, this is one of the movies you can watch over 32 times, (I've watched all three many more than 30 times), and not get sick of. You don't have to know or like the game of chess to enjoy every minute of this VHS.
B00006690G|5.0|The new cd is awesome. eminem is going into a rock feel to his rap vocal sound. this cd is showing how he is growing as a artist. by far his best and there are no in-between stinkers on this cd. i wish there was a better than 5 star rate for this cd for i would give it a 10. way to go eminem
6305949980|5.0|I saw this film when it came to the theater back in '93, and I loved it.  What makes the Special Edition such a treat is the Behind the Scenes track, where you get to meet the mastermind (Tim Burton) and his talented crew.  Watching it, I was awed by the painstaking detail they went through to produce this film.  Anyone who is studying animation shouldn't miss this segment.<br />As for the deleted animation scenes and storyboards, there were a couple I wish they could have included.  I was glad they left out one storyboard with the Evil Scientist revealing his \\"true\\" identity.  That, I felt, was an overused plot idea.<br />I had put the previous DVD edition on my wishlist, hoping to get it for my birthday or Christmas, but that didn't happen.  I'm glad I didn't get it, because I would never have had the justification to buy the special edition.  It was well worth the wait.
B000002UUX|5.0|This speed metal album is the finest thing Megadeth ever produced, and if you could turn all the heat and destructive power of a nuclear explosion into music, this is what it would sound like.<br /><br />Not only is the music mind-blowingly good, but the lyrics and political message therein preconfigure the current world political and military situation by about 12 years.  Songs like Holy Wars, the Punishment Due, and Take No Prisoners somehow predict the madness of war and the clash of religion and culture that is defining the opening years of the 21st century.  Dawn Patrol summarizes the effects of global warming that were barely heard by the public back during this album's release in '90.<br /><br />I've listened to this album countless times over the 12 years I've been listening to it, and it never seems to get old, like a lot of stuff.  This is definitely the best of Megadeth, no questions asked.  Well worth purchasing.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins<br /> equivalent of a nuclear explosion.
B0000009SY|2.0|When the album works, it's fun. You can always enjoy the title track, or Catholic Girls. And Outside Now helps reaffirm what made Zappa a guitar legend. Aside from that, especially with the constant expositions from the Central Scrutinizer who keeps sticking his nose in (sorry, Frank) through the album, I found the album gets dull pretty fast. It's a concept album that goes all over the place.
0736041850|5.0|You'll find yourself frequently referring to this book when you exercise.  Beautiful illustrations show which muscles are used.  Many exercises are covered for all body parts.  I keep my copy with me while I workout.<BR>Variations of an exercise are also covered.<BR>However this book by itself may not be enough to explain a step-by-step way to do an exercise.  Good when combined with 'Muscle Mechanics' or 'Target Bodybuilding'
B0000009SI|4.0|This was certainly the album that made Zappa more known in the mainstream.  What's more impressive is not just his awesome guitar work but his band arrangement. You won't find a group in rock playing more complicated music so tight. Plus it's pretty darn funny. &quot;Yellow Snow&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Debris&quot; are staples of the Zappa catalog making it worthwhile on it's own. For the collector, if you're lucky, you might want to seek out the original Rykodisc release (RCD 40025) which had Apostrophe and Overnite Sensation on a single disc (until they realized they'd make more money selling them seperately, damn capitalists!). Otherwise, Apostrophe is a must.
0451169514|4.0|Wow. This was the first Stephen King book I've read. Now, books never scare me and I've read a lot of horror books. This one gave me nightmares. It took me a while to get into it and it was slow reading for a bit but then I realized I was halfway done. This book will scare you. I used to laugh when people said that.. but it's true. The images are so graphic and gory. The plot & characters are so well done that many times you feel like you're right there with them. I was disappointed with the ending though.  I'm confused as to who or what the entity was.  Don't be turned off by the size of this book.. it's well worth the read.
B00004Z459|5.0|OK. This is one of the best albums that I can actually listen the whole way through. Here are reviews of my 5 favorites:<BR>1. Papercut-Awesome. Aside from ITE, this song is the best on the album.<BR>4. Points of Authority- This song is da bomb. Not quite the best, but it's still awesome. If you get Reanimation, this remix (for this song) is gnarly.<BR>8. In The End- So awesome. This song was the first song by these guys that I've ever heard, and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best they'll ever release.<BR>10. Forgotten- Da bomb junior. This song is great. Again, this one has a nice remix on Reanimation.<BR>12. Pushing Me Away- Nice way to end the CD. A great song. Its remix changes it alot.<br />Grade:A+<BR>What that means: BUY IT AT ALL COSTS.
B00006BXI0|4.0|Symphony X, is very much rated as Progressive Metal Band, With thier distinct taste of Classical Music. They intertwined/mixed classical music and hard rock music. I think you should have a glimpsed of this band if you really liked progressive rock music. I very much like the &quot;Of Sins and Shadows&quot;, &quot;Sea of Lies&quot;, &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; and &quot;The Accolade&quot;, all have very good sense of rhythmic lapses, lyrics w/c are very orthodox in style, and story. All these years I think of Yngwie Malmsteen as a core of this incorporating style of crossover from rock thru classical music, I'd never think that Symphony X would sound much better than yngwie. When I hear Micheal Romeo in the Rush Tribute album, I was amazed by his style of guitar playing, he sounded like a classical guitarist and much pronounced notes as Yngwie. I heard him play the &quot;Analog Kid&quot;, by Rush, and from then on, i really love his style. And The general sound of the band is whoooh!, very much pleasing thru the listener, cause it has a balance of instrumentation. Now, I would like to encourage you guys out there to support the symphony X, to continue the story of progressive lyrical music, a band would sound like an Orchestra with choruses. Hope Symphony X, would continue bringing music to the world. (IV-subdominant - I-tonic) &quot;AMEN&quot;.
B000069HK2|5.0|I would definitely have to rate this CD 5 stars. Everything about every song is great. If you're a fan of emocore, punk, or any subcategories of those two, you must buy this CD! I could go on for pages about it, but I wont. All you need to know is that this CD is made of 12 strong songs. Any of The Used's songs could easily be a single. Enough said. Buy the CD.
B00000I9P1|5.0|Of all the albums released by Survivor I would have to say that When Seconds Count stands as their all time best.  Theres not one bad track or filler to be found on this CD at all. This is one of those CD's that you can pop in and play over and over and never get sick of it.  I've owned this CD for years and I still enjoy it to this day.  I've always loved how Survivor blends their Keyboards and Guitars together, which gives them their signature sound, and its all found right here.
B00005BCPC|3.0|It is really infuriating that Jane Austen's most profound book has been turned into two very frustrating movies.  This most recent film version of \\"Mansfield Park\\" has Frances O'Connor playing Fanny Price as we perhaps wished Austen had presented her.  She has some spirit; she's able to stand up for herself; she's much more her own person than she was portrayed in the BBC version.  The only problem is, this is not Austen's Fanny Price.  (Fanny was portrayed in the other extreme in the BBC version by Sylvestra LeTouzel; she was so whiny, holier-than-thou, judgemental and obnoxious in that film that we were left wondering what anyone could find attractive in this person.)<br /><br />Not only is O'Connor's characterization not Austen's Fanny Price, this movie is not Austen's \\"Mansfield Park\\".  Patricia Rozema took some appalling liberties with Austen's book; here we have Lady Bertram as an opium addict, which is supposed to explain her perpetual indolence; Sir Thomas is Simon Legree redux, and Edmund, who at least had some personality in the BBC version, albeit a moralizing, sanctimonious snob, is little more than a cypher in this film.  And Mary Crawford, depicted by Austen as a kind, generous, sympathetic character, is shown here as nothing more than a conniving little gold-digger.<br /><br />Austen tiptoed around the fact that the Bertram family's fortune came from the blood and toil of the slaves on the family's plantation in Antigua; Rozema shoves it right in the viewer's face with graphic images of Sir Thomas raping and abusing the hapless slaves.  Austen was well aware that the slave trade was an abomination, but she didn't go into it in her book, and it doesn't belong in any movie that purports to be based on the book.<br /><br />Taken on its own, the film is a fairly enjoyable period piece, and Frances O'Connor is a winning heroine; but no way in the world does this movie deserve the title of \\"Mansfield Park\\".<br /><br />Judy Lind
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I had one of the best cinematic experience of my life by watching &quot;Memento&quot;. It blew my head off. Great script, great story, great directing, acting, editing. Brilliant.
0802130208|1.0|If &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; is the world's longest Hallmark card, &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot; has to be the world's longest suicide note.  Only someone trapped in the grip of despair could create a character, a character as near to being unredeemable as any other that I've found in literature.  Perhaps Dickens's Uriah Heep comes close. At the end of &quot;Dunces,&quot; I felt sullied, yet also sad.  I feel as though I'd watched a crime take place -- no, several crimes take place -- and yet could do nothing to stop them. This book, along with &quot;Foucault's Pendulum,&quot; perhaps the most pretentious book ever written, are the only two stories I've read that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend to anyone.  Life really is too short. Having said this, any readers of this story, whether they liked it or hated it, might wish to compare it to either the comic burlesque novel &quot;Gargantua &amp; Pantagruel&quot; or the play &quot;Ubu Roi.&quot;
B00000J7JO|5.0|I think Californication was the Chili Peppers best album to date period!!! They have something for everyone on this album and if i was the peppers i would probably take this as a blueprint for all other chili pepper albums. I think that every track on here had to be a hit all in its own. Yeah blood sugar sex magik made its mark but you just cant deny that Californication was the peppers \\" growing up\\" album. All of my friends whom had listened to this album agree that this had more element than even \\" Mothers Milk\\". I love the chili peppers because they have their own style of music that can't even be categorized and if it was up to me, they would be inducted into the rock n roll hall of fame only becasue they have had such an impact on todays youth and pop culture............rock on Red Hot Chili Peppers we all love ya!!!
0066620996|5.0|I suspect most people who pick up the book will do what I did-- look for the bottom line, the summary of findings.  Reading the summary is not enough.  When I read the summary, I thought the advice was too general and I was disappointed because I wanted  specific information-- I wanted to know each step I needed to take to reach success.  Fortunately, I read beyond the summary, read each chapter in full, which you must do in order to absorb the excellant business logic found in this book.  The book teaches you how to drive the bus toward a successful business.  I learned that just as in driving a car, when you drive a business, you must find the right focal point-- a point not just in front of your front wheel, but far enough ahead that you clearly see the best route to get where you want to go.  The ideas in the book are inspiring and apply to all businesses. My only disappointment was that I did not find a million dollar cashier's check stuck between the pages.
B000000H4V|5.0|i've been a sepultura fan for a few years now and i still find myself discovering new songs by them on various albums. the more i listen, the more i like them. their musicality is amazing and only a person trying to recreate their music can see just how difficult it really is. <br />anyway, listening to chaos a.d. and trying to figure out whether it really is their best album can be difficult but in my opinion it is. not to put down their earlier thrash roots, but songs like slave new world and manifest are amazing and put them at a whole new level. this style of metal really makes you feel like your at the site of a war right during the peak of battle. no other bands that i recall have accomplished that (u might be thinking slayer but thats more like the sound of hell then war). <br />recently max opened up the possibility of reuniting with the band. i find it really interesting but i dont think it'll happen. they're so damn locked into darrin's singing (their new singer)and it really [stinks] because he cant even be compared to max. anyway by this album, you will be happy
B00005NG9Z|5.0|When I first watched this DVD I was pretty hammered and thought it was sweet. Since then I've watched about 15-20 times liking it more and more everytime. Not only the videos but the live scenes and scenes in hotel rooms. It gave me an idea of what they were likeoutside the studio (although I had a slight idea). The videos are still sweet, and if I ever need a reminder of what Layne was like I can pop that sucker in. Need I say more.
B0000636UN|4.0|I loved the &quot;old&quot; Crow albums. This one I've &quot;come to love.&quot; On the first listen I thought that the songs were syrupy and empty, but on the second I began to see a real coherence to the album, and to appreciate the more &quot;ballad&quot; side of Crow. I thought the duet with Henley was great: love lost. I think it is a really strong album. If you give it more than the cursory listen, you will too.
0060523794|2.0|In order to appreciate the essence of Gerstner, I would recommend you first read chapter #12 ('A brief history of IBM').  It's actually much more about the IT industry, or at least Gerstner's understanding of it.  The man admits more than once that he came to IBM knowing nothing about IT, but that he should pen a chapter so littered with errors when leaving IBM is truly lamentable.  For example, contrary to what he writes, IBM aimed the PC at businesses, not 'hobbyists and students', right form the outset.  Contrary to what he writes, IBM was not a 'one-product company' in 1984: highly profitable products like the System/34, the Selectric typewriter and the Displaywriter had been around for years; even the IBM PC had been around for three years.<br />It confirms what many in the industry suspected: that Gerstner never understood IBM's product lines.  That's the main reason why he gave so few interviews -- it was virtually impossible to find a journalist who knew less about IBM's products than he did.  If it was to be an open-ended interview, by the time the journalist got to the third question in any line of inquiry, Gerstner would be embarrassed and humiliated.  He could do the occasional Comdex keynote speech, but there you don't have to take any questions, and anyway your speechwriters draft the text for you.<br />Anyone wondering why the immensely successful AS/400 line fared so poorly under Gerstner will be none the wiser.  He mentions it just once in the book, and then it is just in passing, in a list of products in an appendix.<br />Gerstner complains in this book about other 'outspoken' CEOs like Gates, Ballmer and Ellison, but frankly he could never dare to take them on in open debate, because his understanding of any of the technical issues was so poor.  In this book, he says that every decent CEO must be intimately acquainted with the finances of his or her company, but I cannot believe that a decent CEO should be so distant from the company's own products.  Maybe if Gerstner hadn't spent so much time on public education and non-executive directorships in unrelated companies, he would have had more time to understand the product issues that drive strategy in the IT industry.<br />So what does a bully do when he arrives at a company dominated by products and technology architectures?  Answer: the only way he could begin to level the playing field -- i.e. to reduce the daily embarrassment -- between himself and the existing IBM directors was to shift the focus away from products.  That's why Dennie Welsh's plan to massively expand IBM's services empire became so attractive.  And it's why the whole e-business thing became so attractive to Gerstner in the mid-1990s.  But IBM benefitted little from its e-business mindshare; by then IBM just didn't have the products, and so the main beneficiaries of the Internet boom were Sun and Microsoft.<br />Gerstner admits in this book that, under his direction, IBM now plays the IT markets on a portfolio basis, quickly getting in and out of businesses as the hoped-for profits come and go.  But, in the face of Microsoft, this approach is a disaster for any company with long-term aspirations.  Microsoft is known for its tenacity, for trying again and again with new generations of products until it dominates markets -- witness the desktop market, the office suite market and the handheld markets.  Currently Microsoft is playing the ERP market as a 10-year game.  IBM now gives up on a market after two years; Microsoft almost never gives up.  Which is the more successful?  Indeed there are some who say that the installation of Gerstner was a Microsoft plot to destroy IBM from within -- to get IBM to ditch OS/2 and all its other proprietary architectures, under the &quot;open systems&quot; banner, in order to hand over the highly lucrative server market to the company that realised that to create value, you have to offer differentiated, proprietary products protected by patents.  We'll never know how many Microsoft shares Gerstner held; certainly he dumped much of his IBM stock over the years.<br />This book proves what we already knew: that Gerstner is neither an entrepreneur nor a technocrat.  He is a destroyer, not a builder.  When your company is in trouble, you need someone like Gerstner for 2-3 years to take the really tough decisions about which businesses and assets to sell off.  But it is too much to expect such a person to continue at the helm when rebuilding and rapid growth is needed.  Gerstner stayed at IBM about three years too long -- his dismal revenue record in Appendix C shows this.
B000059QY3|5.0|This is my favorite video recording of 'La Traviata'.  Lopardo's introduction to the &quot;Brindisi&quot; in Act I, and his acting in the fanale, lend a humor and humanity to Alfredo that is rare on the opera stage.  Gheorghiu especially shines an Act II; watch her hands.  With her hands on stage, she could have phoned in the rest of the performance.  This was Georg Solti's last video and his conducting showed a sensitivity that will be the finest testament to his own career.  The sets and costumes are up to the usual high standards of the Royal Opera.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband and I rented the first part one Sunday night from Blockbuster.  Needless to say, once the first part was finished, we had to run back to Blockbuster to get the next tape!  We ended up watching all six tapes in a matter of three nights!  The stories were incredible and we were so sorry once they all stopped.  I recommended them to everyone I have run into.  I have never been so moved by a movie, and to think that someone actually lived that life is so hard to comprehend today.  These are amazing men and we can thank them for our freedom.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I started collecting Cash music over 30 years ago.  Every time I have gotten one of his new albums, I thought it was his best ever. No exception here.  Cash's ragged voice is well suited for the selection of songs.  I bought six of these CDs.  Four for family members and two for myself.  I keep one at home and one at work. Best tracks are &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; and &quot;Hurt&quot;.  These two songs are worth the price of the CD, the rest is free.
0395389496|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best children's books ever written by anyone, anywhere, period.<br />The Polar express is about the spirit of Christmas.<br />It recounts a young boys trip to the North Pole on Christmas Eve to receive the 1st gift of Christmas.<br />The story is heartwarming and the illustrations are exquisite.<br />My son is 20, my daughter 16, and to this day our family tradition is to all sit around our tree and read this book just before going to bed on Christmas Eve.<br />For those who yearn for the spirit of Christmas, this is your book.
1559409002|5.0|Ordered this Criterion DVD strictly by the reviews here on Amazon.  Would like to say I was not disappointed.  I did have the end figured out before the closing frame, as others have indicated, but was still genuinely frightened for what was happening to Mary.  It has been said that Candace Hilligoss's performance caused you not to care about the character, however I did not feel that way.  It was quite an unsettling experience.  As usual, Criterion done an outstanding job on the picture and sound quality, and the box art was really nice.  If I were to say anything negative, it would be to ask \\"Does one really need two versions of the same movie, especially when  we're talking a mere 5 minutes?\\"  Highly recommended fright film to anyone who doesn't need buckets of blood, or gallons of gore.
B00003CXI0|5.0|Despite a few shortcomings, I have to say that this is a good adaptation of an excellent book.  If nothing else, watch the scenes with Alan Rickman as Professor Snape; you won't be disappointed.
B00000F3KL|5.0|Unlike conventional \\"thrillers\\" that depend on car chases and well-timed explosions as their high-points, this movie has as much \\"action\\" or more than any of these, and yet offers much, much more. No, it's not really a thriller, but for those who go to movies to see people get shot up and blown up, you will not be disappointed by seeing this one. <br />While you're there, you'll also be treated to a terrific handling of action in the context of an entire movie. Instead of the conventional \\"let's drop the plot for awhile and have a chase scene\\" scenario, this movie relentlessly puts you in a battle situation where there is the unending possibility of getting whacked any second. And the \\"good guys\\" in this one seem to lose as much as the bad guys.<br />But while excelling with it's portrayal of violence, where it shines is it's plot setting. We in the U.S., while cruel to say, are getting such a regular diet of newspaper articles talking about masses of people getting wiped out in foreign countries that we're actually getting jaded. While sad, it is human nature, and with AIDS ravaging a lot of Africa, and the Middle East dominating the newspapers, many would be pressed to even explain what the big deal about Somalia was<br />But with all that, what is most astonishing about the film is that there seems to be no practical way to stop this. While we would love to be heros and rescue the world, we find that without massive resources committing time, money, and lives, there isn't much we can do about it. The frustration of the soldiers is well shown, but as the residents of that country put it, \\"It's our Civil War, and you don't belong here\\". When the American troops find that the enemy they greatly underestimated is indeed far more armed and committed than they expected, you have to sadly conclude that they might be right.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park sold out w/its remix album, remaking these brilliant songs into cheesy pop songs to a)get more radioplay w/o having to put out an actual album b)for the sake of more money (the definition of selling out)...still, what theyve done since doesnt change this album, and truth be told, it is a rapcore classic, and showed great promise...<br />Linkin Park, while a rap/metal act, does more than just rap over guitar riffs...theyve put together a combination of music in a way few other bands have been able to...the melodies in the songs are great, Chester's piercing vocals jumping to the forefront of their thrashing guitars and drums...Mike's raps serve as mini-interludes under the vocals and are even featured a few times, and really stand out on this album...the two of them are excellent lyricists, and are better than most out there at what they do...\\"Papercut\\" is a very introspective (though that can be said about most of the cuts on this CD) song...in \\"By Myself\\", LP asks the question: \\"do i trust some and get fooled by phoniness/or do i trust no one and live in loneliness\\"...the melancholy desperation present in many of the lyrics on this album are perfect angst-ridden anthems for jaded teenagers, but these lyrics can manifest almost anyones personal fears and anxieties...\\"Pushing me Away\\", the last cut on the album, is an amazing example of the genius lyrics on this album...<br />still, more than lyricism, LP is a great instrumental band...for proof, listen to the keyboard intro to the radio single \\"In The End\\", listen to the metallic sounds of \\"Papercut\\", or listen to the instrumental \\"Cure for the Itch\\"<BR>featuring keyboards, and turntables...<br />Linkin Park has gotten a bad rap from \\"true\\" metalheads as a \\"poppy, wannabe hardcore\\" band or another \\"generic nu-metal\\" band, while in truth they are an intelligent rap/metal band...though they sold out, this album is a classic, mainstream or not and should not be ignored...hopefully Linkin Park will wake up and elaborate on their potential shown in this CD...check it out...peace
B00005UW7V|5.0|It seems like everytime a movie from either Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg comes out it's either loved or hated. Both men have made some of the most amazing movies ever and of course each film that they do has to live up to everyone's expectations and be just as huge as their biggest hits. Eyes Wide Shut wasn't A Clockwork Orange, 2001, or Full Metal Jacket but it's still one of Kubrick's greatest films and what a final film it was, love it or hate it. Spielberg is the genius behind many of the biggest films in movie history. This is the guy that has brought you films like the Indiana Jones trilogy, Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and many many others. For me Spielberg has has had some off moments in his carrer but the moment that A.I. ended I knew that I just witnessed something amazing. I'm only 24 years old but I was lucky enough to see E.T., which is one of the greatest films ever along with the Star Wars films in the theater (it happend to be the first movie I ever saw in the theater). I don't rmemeber seeing it but I do recall seeing it many times since then. After viewing A.I. I just was in awe and couldn't saw anything. It was such a breataking, heartbreaking film much like E.T. was 20 years earlier. To me this is Spielberg's sequel to E.T.! Speilberg has become such a serious film maker since E.T. and this was such a treat and proves that Spielberg is one of the greatest film makers alive and can still bring that magic to the screen. Many people who are fans of Kubrick feel that this film would've looked alot different had Kubrick lived to make this film and many have bashed Spielberg for destroying Kurbrick's vision but it's not like Steven Spielberg just stole his ideas. Kubrick was working with Spielberg on this project and as a tribute to the great film maker he finished it. I do think that this is what a collaboration between these two greats would've looked like. This movie is a little bit of both directors visions and i'm damn glad this film was made. Like it or not but this truly is a film that has to be seen. Like all of Kubrick's projects this will continue to be judged. All of his other ideas are either understood or missunderstood to the point that the viewer just dislikes the film, which is a shame. As for the acting in the film I think it's top notch. I've always disliked Haley Joel Osment's acting (I lothe the overrated garbage that is The Sixth Sense)but in this film he truly shines and makes you feel for the character that he's playing. Bottom line..this is what you get when you put two visionaires ideas together. The end result it one of the greatest films in movie history.Like it or not but this truly is a film that has to be seen. Like all of Kubrick's projects this will continue to be judged.

0385474547|4.0|I read this book as part of an assignment for a cultural diversity course, and it really makes you think about the spread of Christianity and non-Christian religion.  The title is very fitting, as you read, you see the life of the main character fall apart, no matter what he tries to do.  It is also an excellent view into tribal African culture.  Very easy to read, and not too long!
B000002UC5|3.0|Here is my review of what I think of Paul's first solo album. It just gets three stars because it's not great, but it's not bad...<br />1. Lovely Linda<br />The album starts of with this half-minute warm-up. &quot;The Lovely Linda&quot; lets you know right away the direction this album will take. If you're not grabbed in by this one, you'll probably not warm up to the album as a whole. McCartney strums an acoustic guitar and recites lyrics that seem to come out of the spirit of the summer of love (three years earlier!). He sings &quot;la...la...la...lovely Linda, with the lovely flowers in her hair&quot; and abruptly ends the song with the last guitar chord and a silly giggle. The fun is just beginning!!<br />2. That Would Be Something<br />The second song, &quot;That would be something&quot; reminds me almost of the off-the-cuff numbers from the White Album. Paul moves over to electric guitar for this song, and again, sings minimal lyrics over his little riff. The drums are simple but creative, with hits to the cymbals and patting and thumping on guitar cases.<br />3. Valentine Day<br />The first of several instrumental. This one is very short indeed, and could easily have been the type of song he would put somewhere in the White Album. The first three songs on McCartney are the simplest, weakest and most &quot;made-up&quot; sounding on the whole album. He could have put &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; FIRST, but he chose to put it in much later. <br />4. Every Night<br />The first &quot;real&quot; song on McCartney. He has performed this song serveral times in concert over the years. This is the simplest and most original version. Definitely has the &quot;home&quot; sound to it. How it COULD have sounded done in Abbey Road with a few session musicians?!?<br />5. Hot As Sun/Glasses<br />Yet another instrumental. I guess Paul had all these little melodies floating around in his head and decided to record them and get them out of his head once and for all. &quot;Hot assun&quot; has always sounded to me like a little Mexican ditty. The acoustic guitars have almost a latin feel to them. <br />6. Junk<br />The first song on the album that SOUNDS like the McCartney we had come to know and love from those dozen Beatle albums that preceded this first solo album. This could have been on the White Album. A sweet and tender ballad, the kind Paul is famous for. <br />7. Man We Was Lonely<br />A throwaway, but a darn good throwaway. Linda really sings on this one. Had Paul kept this song another year or two and recorded it for Ram with session players I still think it would not have been much of a song. I guess he could have made this song into a medley with &quot;Smile Away&quot; and passed it off as something. Who knows? It has charm, I'll give it that. <br />8. Oo You<br />Having come off Abbey Road just months before, it's hard to believe Paul was writing stuff like this for his first solo album. <br />9. Momma Miss America<br />Another instrumental. This one actually shows off Paul's chops. <br />10. Teddy Boy<br />This could have been on the White Album. It has that sound to it. Nice and acoustic. Nothing fabulous. <br />11. Singalong Junk<br />Just an instrumental version of the song earlier on this album. We didn't really need this, but it does have a nice melody and is pleasant. Certainly as decent as &quot;Martha my dear&quot;<br />12. Maybe I'm Amazed<br />The best song Paul has ever written. <br />13. Kreen - Akrore<br />The worst song Paul has ever written. <br />Well, that's it. That's my review, telling it like it is. If you like the filler stuff on the White Album, you'll like this album. If you like Abbey Road, skip this album and go straight into Ram. Ram picks up where Paul left off on Abbey Road. The McCartney album picks up where the White Album left off.
0452270073|5.0|Pat Barker's magnificent trilogy is not only a profound contribution to our literature on the First World War - it is also one of the most distinguished works of contemporary fiction in any genre.  Barker doesn't skirt around the central issues with a po-faced patriotic reverence, but rather tackles them head on: the agonizing contradictions of patriotism and protest; the politics of social and self-surveillance; the homoerotic undertones of trench camaraderie, especially among the war poets; the horrendous physical and psychological costs of war; and the sense of personal duty which drives us, nonetheless, to fight.  These are big themes, but Barker's talent is to handle them in a way which makes her novels feel like an easy read.  They are accessible, engaging, seemingly simplistic in their style - but in the end profoundly moving in a way which only the highest literature aspires to be.  The trick is that she makes her characters so real for us - Prior and Rivers, the consistent protagonists, are completely human.  She makes us experience a world-historical incident on a very human scale.  Harrowing, intelligent, moving and funny, Barker has crafted a fictional epic that will stay with you forever.  Walking through Sydney's Central railway station months after finishing these books, I came across the honour boards listing the hundreds of railway men and women who died in the Great War.  Barker's books made the war real for me, made these lives - these deaths - real.  If they do nothing more than that for you, they've succeeded.
B000069HK2|5.0|The first song I heard before buying this CD was &quot;Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot;, and let me tell you, that song alone blew me away. I generally don't buy CDs after hearing only one song. But, I made an exception for The Used. And that was a good thing.<BR>First off, Bert's vocals are so freaking raw. His scream is high and powerful, his singing voice is melodic and beautiful...and his super-octave singing voice is incredible! How can a guy sing so high without...well, never mind.<BR>Second, the album displays such a diversity in each song, it makes you wonder (and look forward to) what will happen next. From soft, heart-felt love songs to aggressive, beat-you-in-the-face songs to emotionally tormented songs, The Used keep you pumped up and satisfy your hunger for raw, talented new music.<br />NOTE: The bonus video for &quot;Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; is also pretty cool, as is the clip of the band during recording, which displays a very amusing side to the band.
B000002UJQ|5.0|From the opening guitar grunge on \\"Airbag\\" to the wailing `slow down' of Yorke on the last song, Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" possesses a unity and completeness that is rarely found nowadays. This album is, arguably, one of the greatest, if not the greatest, albums of the 90's. My favorites are... actually I can't name any, because they are all incredible and all add to the mood of the album. The album would not be complete with any tracks missing; each paints a separate picture that blends into the whole that is \\"OK Computer.\\" If you need further proof, check out \\"Strung out on OK Computer,\\" a string arrangement of the CD that really brings out the mood.
B00005T30L|5.0|Actually, I don't know what was more fun - watching Thora Birch's excellent acting in this movie, or reading the one-star reviews posted here on amazon[.com] from people who didn't like the film.  I agree that 'Ghost World' is an acquired taste.<br />The one scene that sticks in my head is the series of encounters Birch's Enid has when she decides to give it go as counter help at a movie concession stand.  Her snarky, jaded look at the world results in a series of hilarious \\"customer friendly\\" interactions.  And...she's out of there.  It's a perfect set of takes by Birch.

This is an excellent book for some one who would like to learn something about life but is affraid to ask.
0066620996|4.0|The book is great and provides rational insights into how business can be successful.  Very factual based and well researched.  It is an extremely interesting read.  It has many pearls of information, but no diamonds.  For diamonds, look at the strategy and tactics of pricing.
0553573403|4.0|I guess that one of the reasons why this series is so addicting is that it does not succumb to the normal storytelling dynamics (though some storytelling maniacs could probably fit the template as they usually do... ;)  )<br />Anyway, the many small stories in which we follow the different characters adds a lot of suspense to the books.
0060512806|2.0|The paperback version is more than 1100 pages, printed on thin paper in 8-pt. type. No kidding. It's difficult to hold in your hand, even, like an overstuffed sandwich. It's also difficult to slog through because it's so slow and irrelevant in so many places, has many anachronisms (careless on research other than endless tech details), and filled with overwritten, convoluted prose. Some of it is interesting, much of it is clever, all of it should have been cut by half.
B000006OS2|1.0|Boy, do I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this DVD. I love this story, but the video quality is so poor as to take away from the enjoyment of the movie. Far too many scenes are out of focus or the color is off.   It would be nice if the original producer of this movie would put it out on DVD, because I would jump at the chance to replace this piece of [trash]

B00003CXRM|5.0|This is an all-around great movie -- music, cinematography, and particularly the acting.  As for the people that say the Southern accents are bad, I'm from Mississippi and lived there at the time they filmed the movie.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear how authentic the accents were as compared to other Hollywood attempts.  In general, people from Mississippi seemed to be very proud of this movie at the time it came out (this should really say something given the manner in which the state has historically been depicted in movies).  <br />The cinematography was gorgeous, and the music moved me not only to buy the soundtrack, but also the companion CD \\"Down From the Mountain\\" (I also attended the concert).  It's been amazing to see the resurgence the film has single-handedly brought bluegrass music.  In fact, the film should almost be treated as a musical, because of the important role it plays throughout.
B000069I1H|3.0|Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) is a hard working detective for the LAPD who cares about the job and the responsibility that comes with it.  When a drug bust goes bad Mitch is ordered to work with a TV station that wants to make a reality cop show in order to prevent a $10 million law suit.  The incompetent Trey Sellers (Eddie Murphy), who only cares about his acting career, is going to be his sidekick.  These two characters face a new threat on the streets, which can be extremely fatal to the police force.  Showtime is an humorous action comedy with contrasting characters which add to the entertainment.

Lilo & Stitch is a film about family, belongingness, and love that is experienced through hilarious laughs and serious thoughts.
0345448898|1.0|After I finished the last book I was annoyed at best. What a waste of time, both Pullman's writing of them and my reading them. How was I to know that the whole series would be based on the same old mistake that uninformed people have been making for nearly 2000 years. They think that Catholics are Christians. Sorry to disturb your atheist fantasies, but Catholicism has ALWAYS been anti-Christian. Pullman is right about Catholicism. He doesn't know anything about the Truth contained in the Bible.Oh yeah, neither do Catholics.<br />As for comparisons to Tolkien...get serious!!!
B0000029AP|5.0|That's what Toys In the Attic is. Every single track is signiture Aerosmith rock n roll magic. If your new to Aerosmith's music, this is a good album to start with because it really shows there true colors, unlike Big Ones.  Toys In the Attic was the album that broke Aerosmith into the mainstream with songs like &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way.&quot; But if you've heard enough of these songs, despite their masterpiecefulness (I love making up words,) as I am, there are AWESOME songs like the title track, Uncle Salty, Adam's Apple, No More No More, and Round and Round that are simply classic. If you dont have this album, you gotta get it, its as easy as that.
0786867973|1.0|Nigella is a beautiful and intriguing creature who honestly makes cooking look fun and pleasurable. Unfortunately, this book is a sour disappointment and makes even &quot;accomplished domestic goddesses&quot; frustrated and disgruntled. On more than several occasions I have tried to make different desserts from this book and every one of the recipes have been some degree of terrible to okay. For example, I have tried the &quot;simple&quot; almond cake, white chocolate raspberry tart, snickerdoodles, and black berry galette and all of them have been disappointing. The almond cake did not rise, the snickerdoodles were dry, the chocolate tart was extremely bitter, and the blackberry galette contained too much cornmeal and was mushy. Now, while I am not a gourmet chef, I do know my way around a kitchen and follow &quot;recipes&quot; everyday as a scientist, leading me to believe that my experiences with Nigella's recipes are not simply attributed to technique. Therefore, I must conclude that either there is some discrepancy in the ingredient quality between Britain and US, the measurements given, or the equipment used (or sadly, that the recipes are just bad). I am sorry to say that I will not buy another Nigella cookbook but will spend my money on dependable recipes from authors such as Ina Garten, &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot;.
B000000OTU|5.0|I am a huge Aerosmith fan, and of coarse I own Big Ones.Its a great album; has all of those songs that everyone knows, (Janies Got a Gun, Cryin, Crazy, Love In an Elevator, Dude (Looks Like a Lady)). There all masterpeices, and as people in other reviews have said, I really recommend this CD for someone who doesn't really know any Aerosmith songs.  If you really want to get a great album with signature Aerosmith [awesome]... rock n roll, unfortunately, this is not for you...you should try Toys in the Attic or Rocks. Furthermore, if you want a greatest hits type collection, all of the songs on this CD are classic, but if you get the new \\"Oh Yeah Ultimate Aersomith Hits\\" you will get a better idea of what its all about.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Hello! Playstation 2 is alot better than the xbox because you have to wait for ever for the xbox to load up!! In the playstatation 2 it only takes like 30 seconds to load up so then you can start playing as soon as you want to. In the xbox you can get a memory card but you will never know when it will forget the stuff you saved on it. On the platstation 2 you will Know because it guarantees that the memory card will not lose the information and can hold as much data as you want it to. I have a playstation 2 and it is the coolest! You also get better graphics than on the xbox. My friend was talking about how great the xbox was and i told him that it wasn't that great and I told him that the playstation 2 was better and why I thought that. If you have alot of games that you play on the xbox get a playstation 2 and you will find out that I am right. So viewers get a Playstation 2! Bye now!(:
0694003611|5.0|I was skeptical about the merits of this book at first as I read it to my daughter (1 year-old at the time, now 18 months). I was looking for some kind of cute plot and message, which is the format of most kids' books. However, I soon found that this was the book that she wanted out of the dozen or so that we read to her initially. It worked without fail to hold her attention, whereas other books left her looking around the room and squirming. I do believe that the alternating sequences of black and white and vivid colors, along with the very brief wording and soft word selections are masterful. This author somehow tapped into the psyche of infants and toddlers. The result? My daughter calls for \\"Moon\\" almost every night. And I'm glad to put her in a peaceful mood as she goes to bed.
B000065AQU|5.0|To begin with, I LOVE this cd; however, when I purchased 'Toxicity' I was expecting all of the tunes to have the harmonies present in Chop Suey! and (the song) Toxicicity.  That was not the case.  Not all of these tracks are quite as catchy (at first) as the songs getting radio play.<br />With that said, this is an incredible cd!  It'll definitely be on your list of cd's that make you drive about 80 miles/hour on the highway without even noticing.  This cd has some heavy material on it, great for unwinding after a long day.  There's some serious intensity on this disc that I can't describe in words.  I picked up the disc after hearing Chop Suey! and Toxicicty and it's been in heavy rotation in the car ever since.<br />PLUS - You get the bonus DVD with the Toxicity Video and 3 live tracks (Prison, Chop Suey!, &amp; Bounce).<br />If you're looking for somthing heavy, pick this up. But just know that it's not all &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; and &quot;Aerials&quot;.
B00005JKBB|2.0|Couple of problems: First, one cannot help compare the movie with Redford's \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" which was about a thousand times better.  <br />Second, I agree with the other reviewers who can't understand why we should feel sympathy with Brad Pitt because he's fallen in love with a British leftist who is openly sympathetic to terrorists, if not one herself.  And for that reason, they can't understand why Redford would risk everything he has - life savings, career, et.al. - to save him.  Wasn't Redford's character right the first time?<br />Ask yourself this: if the British terrorist had not been played by the beautiful, soft skinned Catherine McCormack but rather by Roseanne Barr, would you sincerely believe that she was worth breaking out of prison?  Call that remark cruel if you like, but remember that it's Tony Scott who's truly insulted the viewers by suggesting that murderous, terrorist tactics are not so bad so long as the girl supporting them looks good and says things like, \\"and I have to live with that.\\"<br />Still, the scene at the end with Redford racing the vintage Porsche off the CIA grounds is pretty cool.  But cool scenes, cool cars and cool sportcoats can't complete a film.
B000007177|5.0|I probably have been listening to Jethro Tull for over 25 years now. I was a professor in India and I am teaching in a private college now in Auckland, New Zealand. My dream come true experience was when they played in Madras, India and I was one among their 1000s of fans in India.It's amazing how they manage to do what they do! I wonder whether its Ian's genius in brewing such complicated but fantastic tunes, flute/vocals or Martin's acoustic and electric guitars or Barrie Barlow's drumming or Jeffery Hamond's bass that makes JT (Jethro Tull)so unique. It also facinates me how they manage so many live concerts in many parts of the world. It's pure dedication and professionalism guys. Its not easy. <br />I have been listening to other rock bands like Led Zep, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Uriah Heep etc ..but they are no comparison to the Jethro Tull's genius.<br />I have to go now <br />more later<br />Cheers<BR>Dr. James
B00006RU5B|2.0|How wonderful was it to see the band of RATM back together minus Zack. However I was disappointed in this album because I expected the intensity and energy that Zack gave to Rage. It is just not present in this album with the new singer. I am also biased towards the lyrics of Rage. Don't buy this album if your expecting something along the lines of Rage because it doesn't measure up.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus, being the first Tool album I bought, utterly blew me away. I saw the video for &quot;Schism&quot; on late-night MTV and have been hooked since. Maynard's hypnotic voice, Adam's seamless riffs, Justin's perfect bass, and Danny's stunning drums combine into quite possibly the best album I have ever heard. I have also purchased a few of the older titles, and they are amazing as well, but I think Lateralus is the best yet, and I hope Tool's next release is even more stunning !
B00005JKG9|5.0|GlenGarry Glen Ross is a cinematic masterpiece!<br />The movie tracks the competition between 4 real estate salesmen and their dealings with their boss.  As the movie begins, all of the salesmen are fired for their poor performance.  In order to get their jobs back, a sales contest has been created.  As Alec Baldwin put it in his chilling speech in the beginning of the movie &quot;First place is a Cadallic, Second place is a set of Steak Knives.  Third place is....You're fired.&quot;<br />The remainder of the movie tracks the efforts of the salesmen to get their jobs back.  There is competition, backstabbing, deceit, and everything else that you can imagine.  <br />The most striking aspect of this movie is the dialogue.  It is incredibly well written and this cast is first rate.  Here is what you need to know:<br />**Alec Baldwin - The super sucessful salesman from &quot;downtown.&quot;  He drives a BMW and is sent on a mission of mercy to try and get the other guys to produce.  He only has about 10 minutes in the movie, but his part will leave you stunned.<br />**Al Pacino - The young guy.  Spends most of his time trying to smooth talk bar patrons into buying real estate.  He is the up and comer and an extremely smooth talker.<br />**Jack Lemmon - The has been.  Shelly &quot;the machine&quot; Levine spends his days clinging to his long lost glory.  He used to be a major producer, but has hit a streak of bad luck and is in danger of losing his job.<br />**Ed Harris - The complainer.  Spends most of his time complaining about hot he is not getting the good leads and that he has done everything he can with the leads he is given, but fails to produce.<br />**Kevin Spacey - The spineless office manager.  Has no consideration for his employees and just does whatever &quot;downtown&quot; tells him too.<br />Buy this movie and watch it!
B00005YU1O|5.0|Let me start by saying that this film is a visual treat of the highest order.  Right up there with the best of the best in animation, and should be in every serious/artsy DVD collection for its incredible visual artistry alone.  I would like to personally congratulate all of the animators.  The original score, too, is very worthwhile - rather than assembling a collection of the alterna-pop du jour, Linklater wisely chose an acoustic troupe whose boudouir-Bartokian richness and lyricism lends a new layer of sophistication to the experience.  Purely in terms of sensory bravura, &quot;Waking Life&quot; offers more than any of Linklater's other films.<br />But, in terms of the story, &quot;Waking Life&quot; falls a little short of Linklater's brilliant feature debut.  If you've seen and absorbed &quot;Slacker&quot; as many times as I have, you can clearly see the roots of this film with one viewing.  It's a return to the original inspiration, with a nod to the commercial perspiration (a la Delpy and Hawke).  The familiar Austin backdrops remain visible to the discerning eye: the Drag, the Capitol, the UT Campus, and the trendy coffee-houses.  Several characters from &quot;Slacker&quot; make an appearance as well, sometimes in similiar roles, sometime radically shifted.  Linklater attempts more narrative coherence in &quot;Waking Life&quot; by casting the impossible-to-dislike Wiley as a central protagonist around whom the chaos revolves, but it's the chaos itself that's not as interesting.  It just doesn't hit as hard in the post-Terence-Mc-Kenna age.<br />There are cogent discussions (by a UT professor on the positive and pragmatic modes of Existentialism, a spiritual linguist on &quot;Byzantine&quot; discourse semantics, by a crackpot driving emcee on post-capitalist revolutionism, and by a redheaded pixie on the ant-like behavior of socialized humans).  There are also the moments of violence that Linklater has always felt the need to foreground, but in WL they are sometimes handled not as skillfully.  And, inevitably, there are some quite banal, repetitive, or otherwise not-so-hot ideas and emotions being tossed around.  It seems as though the characters are trying too hard, the script is too tight (whether consciously or not), and the result is a series of &quot;my twenty cents&quot; moments rather than a story that emerges from a true creative chaos.<br />All of that aside, the film will indeed make you think and perhaps even dream.  Give it a chance.  The messages within &quot;Waking Life&quot; are essential as an antidote to consumer culture.  If the experience of the film opens doors, writes question marks, and begs us to dream just a little bit more, then it has done its due.  The struggle of maintaining one's dignity and individualism within an increasingly complex universe is the essential one faced by both everyman and the intellectual who doesn't simply want to cave into the forces of late capitalist culture.  Reinjecting humanity, creativity, and even magic into our everyday life is the film's urgent message to me, and I think that message is communicated quite well.  If, for example, we can take the film's own embedded interpretation of the filmic experience itself as a &quot;holy moment&quot; (rather than holding it to the same standards of judgment as we do written discourse), then perhaps my criticms are beside the point.<br />All in all, I am glad the real Linklater is back.  When someone pushes the edge as hard as he does with this film, and pulls it off with confidence and panache, he deserves our support and kudos for a long time to come.  He certainly has mine.
B0000028P8|5.0|For a few years before his EP was released, all of the music industry claimed that Mariah Carey was a studio production.  BOY, DID SHE PROVE THEM WRONG!!  Not only did she blast her critics, she rolled them over.  Getting down to the basics: drums, back-up singers, and piano, allowed Mariah to showcase her voice.  The song &quot;Make It Happen&quot; on this EP is better than the recording on the album &quot;Emotions.&quot;  My friends didn't believe me when I said she could sing live &quot;Vision of Love&quot; just like the recorded version.  Well, not totally alike because there are too of her on the album version.  But, listen to the last 20 seconds of the song and tell me if that doesn't sound the same.  I didn't think you could.  I great album to buy if you love hearing singers sing live (for real).
B00005YXZH|1.0|hard to believe records companies are spending millons of dollars<BR>to prevent coping this stuff!Not worth the plastic it's burned on
B00002E23E|3.0|Zep still pack a punch 30 years on. The best part of this DVD is the live performances, the songs from Houses of the Holy sound better now than they seemed to then, particularly the Rain song and No Quarter. Unfortunately the fantasy sequences now seem pure Spinal Tap, but ok, it was the seventies. The lengthy Dazed and Confused is total excess and Whole Lotta Love sloppy. One poignant moment in the intro to Stairway to Heaven when the camera shows the New York skyline and the Twin Towers...<br />Good reissue even with poor sound.
B00006F83Y|4.0|I got this cd not knowing a thing about this band. I purchased it because I am a huge fan of Dave Grohl behind the drumset. The man is just a wizard on the drums. I was very pleased with what I heard. Josh Homme's guitar and singing are top-notch and Nick Oliveri is a madman with the bass. He also has a sweet Fu Manchu!!! If you like fun, funky, hard rocking music, then this cd is right up your alley. Crank the volume and sit back for a good time.
B00000IPAX|5.0|before i start this review, this cd isn't for you if you're scared of listening to something sounding vaguely like pop, you are pretty pretentious and think you care about quality song writing, snub your nose at 3 chord songs (i'm pretty sure though that sure more than 3 chords are used in most tracks!), or you think blink \\"sold out\\".<br />ok well i got that over with. this is one of the best cds you'll ever hear. it's fun, easily accessible and will stick to your cd player for weeks on end! if you haven't any blink cds already then buy this one, you'll later find yourself owning the whole blink catalogue of cds.<br />buy it now !!![...]it's [...]very well spent.
B00004Z400|5.0|With the deftones third album, \\"White Pony\\", the band takes a different approach to their music. Usually when a band does this their album ends up [being bad]. Not this one tho. Even tho the songs on this cd are slower, they are just as good, if not even better, than those from the previous two albums. White Pony is a very moody album, with dark, haunting lyrics, accompanied by the equally dark and haunting voice of Chino Moreno. Stephen' guitar surges through the whole album, mixed with Chi's bass, Abe's amazing drumming, and especially Frank's turntable samples, to create a very moody and eerie atmosphere that will be sure to interest the listener the whole time through. Tracks like \\"Digital Bath\\", \\"Knife Party\\", and \\"Passenger\\"(one of my favorites) showcase this quality. But dont assume the whole cd is made up of mellowed-out songs. There are heavy ones like \\"Street Carp\\", \\"Elite\\", and \\"Korea\\"(the hardest song on the album) that show the deftones can still rock. So if you good alternative metal that is intriguing and just awesome at the same time, make sure to check out this cd. Im also looking foward the release of their new (fourth)album, which is rumored to be the heaviest of all their albums...

0679734767|4.0|Equally entertaining in it's own right, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde maintained my interest. However, since it is not the slang I am used to in speech and in text, the language was difficult for me to comprehend at first.  But as the story progressed, I was able to keep up with the extensive vocabulary and sentence structures. The story line captivated me, being mysterious and well put together. Dr. Jekyll is a jolly man who is well liked and well respected, and with good reason. Initially, I was fond of this character as his lawyer, Mr. Utterson, described him throughout the book. Yet, when it is revealed what Dr. Jekyll did, my opinion of him becomes shady and unsure. This character is essential and puzzling in this story, causing one to wonder his credibility. Mr. Hyde, on the other hand, is a man who is easily dislikable. He shows no reason to be admired most notably when he does the unthinkable. Murder, mystery, missing links and possibly psychotic scientists ... and that's just the beginning. This book obviously had no trouble intriguing me.
B000006045|5.0|i have approximately 1500 cd's spanning almost every genre imagineable. and this is the one of the best cd's ive ever had the pleasure of owning. From an objective standpoint the work on this cd so perfectly reaches its aim that while listening to it (from the first track) you can tell how flawlessy it has been engineered... subjectively, there is no way to describe it. it fits in no genre. its almost like a mirror of the rap-rock 'movement', except instead of rap there is singing from several different vocalist (most notably elizabeth frasier from the cocteau twins) and instead of rock there is guitar distortion, moogs, keyboards and a slew of undefinable sounds. <BR>definate chill-out music <br />the final product is smooth, dark, sly, uplifting and entrancing. the replay value for this cd is a perfect 10 out of 10. <br />The last bit of info i can give on this cd is this, its the only cd i own that EVERY SINGLE PERSON I HAVE PLAYED IT FOR HAS GOTTEN A COPY OF THEIR OWN... and if your into this one check out portishead, ruby, massive attacks previous album protection, tricky, bjork, everything but the girls 95' album 'walking wounded', and peter gabriel (especially the new one: 'UP'...
B00006CXSS|5.0|Simply the Best series ever done - period.  Words can't describe how well done this is.  You can't describe it to people in words.  It's about as close to being there as you could get. The acting is incredible, the story line is real, and the photography and realism is beyond belief.  You feel like you are right there with them.<br />The extras are very interesting and the DVD transfer is flawless.<br />What more could you want?  Go out and get another one before you wear your first copy out.
0618002235|5.0|The Two Towers is an awesome novel.  The first time I read the Lord of the Rings, I thought the Two Towers was the weakest of the three novels.  Since then I have read it again and believe it to be much better than The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Rings.  After I finished reading The Fellowship of the Rings for the second time, I remember thinking, &quot;Hopefully the Two Towers won't be too dull.&quot;  I got my wish.  In fact, each page of the Two Towers built my enthusiasm and anticipation.  I could not put it down.  The Fellowship of the Ring creates a masterful plot, and the Two Towers magnifies it.  <br />The Two Towers recieves it names from the towers of Orthanc and Minus Morgul.  At Orthanc the deeds of Aragorn, Merry, Pippen, Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas are performed.  In Rohan they bring about the destruction of Isengard.  The latter part of the novel returns to Frodo and Sam and their journey across Mordor and Ithilien to Minas Morgul.  The book closes with disaster approaching the quest of the ring and war coming to Minas Tirith.<br />Tolkien is an awesome author whose imagination and skill has inspired my own imagination on many journeys.
B000066NW0|5.0|I was reading these reviews saying all these bad things about Avril, and it really annoyed me.  The people writing the reviews probably don't even know her!  I think the CD is great, and if you're thinking about buying this, I can tell you that you will absolutely love it.  I've had the CD ever since it came out, and I still listen to it 24/7.  Don't listen to people who tell you Avril is a bad person because it doesn't matter.  Her music is what matters.  If you want to hate her then fine.  But if you want to judge her music, don't say it's bad because you hate Avril.  I would reccomend this CD to everyone who likes music.  Those bad reviews aren't true.  So go ahead and buy the CD because you will be VERY glad you did.
0066214122|5.0|I have been reading Michael Crichton since I read Jurassic Park ten years ago, which soon became one of my favorite books.  Since then, I have avidly read Crichton's entire fiction collection as well as Travels, and Crichton has become one of if not my number one favorite author.  His eloquent, chilling, enthralling, and most of all unique books are second to none.  Released almost three years after his previous book, Timeline; Prey is another well-researched, cutting-edge, techno-thriller.<br />    Prey is considerably different than Timeline, besides the common link of a science lab in the middle of the desert.  I want to say Timeline is a bit more exciting than Prey, because up until the 40 or 50 page climax, the antagonist(s) are relatively intangible.  Those familiar with Crichton's works will notice many more similarities with The Andromeda Strain (also in a lab in the desert) and later in the book Jurassic Park and The Lost World.  Like The Andromeda Strain the bad guys are microscopic and constantly evolving, but this time there's a twist, and possibly by the end on Prey, it may twist beyond all scientific possibility (I don't know, maybe not...hell, his last book was about time travel...it is science fiction), which to me may have be the only flaw for those who try to approach the book as an essay in a scientific journal and not as a novel (which the earlier portions of the book will temp you to do).<br />    Throughout the book are the ever-more-concrete evil nanoparticles (little robots), driven by programming intended to simulate artificial life (not, Michael Crichton emphasizes, to be confused with artificial intelligence...at least until late in the book where the vacuum left when the science disappears is filled with action), and so-called \\"emergent behavior\\" engendered by genetic, evolutionary, predatory behavioral algorithms...strait out of recent advancements in computer science.<br />    ...I know to most that may seem like a foreign language to those whose faces would go blank if I told them to obey me, because I am root, but in fact the book is very readable, and the science and pace make the concepts interesting and within the grasp of most readers.  The book's action scenes are very exciting, but can be a little repetitive, nothing compared to his dinosaur evading, medieval battling past books.<br />    The strongest point of this novel are Crichton's characters who are much more human than most characters in his past books.  This is amplified by his choice to use 1st person, which he has not used before in anything I have read of his (not counting his autobiography, Travels of course).<br />    The rights to make the book into a movie were bought by 20th Century Fox around six months ago (extremely early...it came along with the announcement of the book's existence), and with good reason, as the book is very cinematic and I look forward to it as well as Paramount's upcoming Timeline movie, and hopefully Disney will take advantage of its $10 million investment on movie rights to Airframe (another wonderful Crichton book).  When the plot comes together, and the theme expressing the dangers of these rather new and unexplored areas of science, you will realize that this is a very good book, one of Crichton's best.  His message is clear, the book is very fascinating, the action is innovative and exhilarating, and the pages fly by, and I cannot emphasize enough how strongly I recommend this book to any fan of thrillers, science fiction, or just plain science.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was recommended Norah Jones by Amazon, and I fell in love with the first song I heard. I had to have the cd. She is the perfect blend of folk, country, soul and jazz. She puts me at ease and I just love this cd. Definitely deserves 5 stars.
B000070WJE|5.0|Robbie Williams new CD is excellent!! Once again he completely changes his image, in his attempt to keep his music new and meaningful. By infusing his typically witty pop lyrics with a rock funk, Robbie's newest evolution is truly remarkable. From fun tracks of excess, like the amusing &quot;Hot Fudge&quot;, to his sensitive introspective tracks like &quot;Feel&quot;, Mr. Williams gives hope to music lovers stuck in a world of thong clad blondes. His new CD is truly a triumph.
B000066NW0|4.0|Frankly I highly enjoyed this album. I enjoy alternative and this is NOT alternative in any way whatsoever, but that's okay. It's melodic radio-friendly &quot;adult contemporary&quot;. It's along the same lines as Vanessa Carlton, Michelle Branch, and a whole other slew of singer-songwriters. There are some really beautiful songs on this album. Unfortunately, a lot of people dislike my favorite song, on the album, &quot;I'm With You&quot;. I think it's one of the more beautiful songs to come out in a the past few years, and it really shows her impressive, nasal-free vocals. <br />Unfortunately, this album is occasionally dragged down by look-a-like songs. &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot;, &quot;My World&quot; all are distinguishable, but not by much. The tempos and melodic arrangements are very similar, and to put it gently, bland. <br />However, songs such as the aforementioned &quot;I'm With You&quot;, the first single, &quot;Complicated&quot;, the quasi-ballad &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, and vulnerable &quot;Naked&quot; make this album worth buying. <br />Also a comment: I can deal with the whole &quot;quasi-punk&quot; persona she puts on, as it doesn't affect her music. However, the song &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; is the real example of her sometimes laughable lyrics. I mean: &quot;I'm not the milk and Cheerios in your spoon&quot;. Say WHAT? Anyway, besides that dissapointing white-rapper disaster, the album is refreshingly simple and melodic, with some sparkling vocals and occasionally impressive lyrics, not to mention impressive, soothing vocals. I would recommend this album to most people, there's something here for most people to enjoy.<br />[Off Topic Comment to Those on These Reviews]--Please could everybody stop digging for insults? We *get it*. Also, why on earth would you say Avril Lavigne is not her real name? It's not exactly catchy or anything, a horrible stage name. Also, &quot;Avril&quot; is French for April, and she hails from Canada, so it's very likely it's her real name. Feel free to complain about her music, but this is not a discussion board for your anger at her quasi punk image. This is to discuss her music. If you feel like warning people this is not punk music, go ahead by all means, but why must we all be so immature as to get personal? Why insult her name, or call her ugly/cootie-face/similarly kindergartenish name? Let's all be grown up, shall we?
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I say, \\"Christina,\\" Aguilera comes to everyone`s mind. Now, what follows after her name is mostly just hate-talk. (Trust me, I used to be one of them.) I can argue about her image and how she tries too hard to look [] raunchy. But for <BR>me to partake in all this hate-talk, when the least of my problem is to add further gasoline into the blazing flame of on-going critisms about today`s singers, is really just too redundant and meaningless. Then, what IS meaningful? <BR>I`ve gotta say one of her singles, Walk Away on her new <BR>album, Stripped, really struck a chord within me. I confindently guarantee with my reputation as an alternative fan at stake that you`ll agree with me 110% on this. Be sure to lend the song your ears, not your immediate jump to conclusions.
0784011710|5.0|There are those who like private ryan and those who like the thin red line and there are those who like schnidler's list and those who like sophie's choice. I am of the latter category in both cases. This art house look at unmatched tragedy during the second world war is a great work of art. Meryl Streep is beautiful and shines in every way.
B000002LEU|5.0|Shadow that stood by the side of the road<br />Always reminds me of you<br />--Komakino<br />I bought this CD on an impulse yesterday from the local used music store. Prior to that, I'd read lots of hype about Joy Division and heard maybe one or two songs always meaning to check out the band, but never did anything about it. Now my only question is, what took me so long to discover this amazing band?<br />As I listened to the music unfold the story of isolation and haunting melancholy, I was carried away to another time and place. This album is like a soundtrack because it truly paints a picture of what was going on in Ian's life, and even though I haven't heard a lot of details about his life story, I listened and felt that some songs were prophetic of his demise. Yet I couldn't be depressed while I listened--oddly, the music seems therapeutic and comforting. (Maybe some of these emo kids need to learn a thing or two from Joy Division next time they feel like writing some whiny sad song...)<br />My favorites after one listen are Autosuggestion, Atmosphere, Warsaw, From Safety To Where?, Komakino, She's Lost Control, and of course Love Will Tear Us Apart. But it's really hard to separate any of these songs from the rest of the collection--like trying to choose favorite strokes on a canvas. You need all of them to get the whole picture.<br />Highly recommended--already I know this will be all I listen to for the next month.
B00006SFBD|5.0|for those who dont appreciate this cd, i would say give it time becasue like all other opeth cd's this one is just as rewarding. rock music at it's best.Period.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is absolutely spectacular.  The best I have heard in a looooooooooong time.  I'm not even a huge CA fan.  I mean I've always liked her &amp; her voice, but this CD has changed it all.  I am now a certified 32 year old CA fan. &amp; please stop comparing her to the rest of the pop world.  CA rises above all the rest &amp; I have a profound respect for her.  She is an extroadinary talent &amp; involved herself in every facet of composing this record including writing, producing, &amp; composing which is very unlike the other so called pop &quot;artists&quot; who have other people write their music.  This CD is a real personal &amp; emotional songbook.  Every song is outstanding.  Awesome lyrics and beautiful inspirational music.  Every song on this CD is spectacular.  Oh, I cannot believe people are so uptight over the song DIRRTY.  It's a great club/dance song.  I admit the video could have been better; however, the rest of the music on this cd is unlike DIRRTY.  The music is beautiful &amp; inspirational &amp; her voice soars to the Heavens.<BR>GO BUY THIS ALBUM.  TRUST ME IT'S THE BEST OUT THERE &amp; I OWN ALOT OF CD'S &amp; in different musical genres.
0316666343|5.0|I read, on average, two to three novels a week, and not often do I come across a book as haunting and beautifully written as The Lovely Bones. For a long time I didn't read the book, though it had been recommended to me and I'd read the reviews. As a rule, I do not read that many books where the storyline includes murder, especially in this case where it's a young girl who is killed, because I find no pleasure in reading about such topics. However, once I began reading, it was so different than I expected. The book focuses much more on the emotional pain of the girl and the family who is left behind. It was so different and really special. It was harrowing, but it was so reverent, Sebold's writing is so careful, and the narrative is so personal and direct, that I was touched in a way I never had been by a book with a similar plot. I never feel she's going overboard. It is easily one of the best books I have read in the past decade, and I would not at all be surprised to see it win either the Pulitzer or the National Book Award this year.
B000001GPX|5.0|I just had one comment about this symphony. The first movement of Beethoven's 5th is a great example of how the master could take melodic material apparently uninteresting in isolation and that is hardly a melody at all, and yet employ it to good effect. It's really just a four-note motif, or \\"idee fixe,\\" as the French would say, but he was able to build an entire movement--in fact, one of the great symphonic movements--on such a minimalist four-note pattern. There is no greater testimony to Beethoven's genius.<br />Beethoven of course made many other important contributions to music. Besides his many compositions, he made contributions to the areas of both musical harmony and musical form. He increased the complexity of harmony, in terms our ability to move around the circle of fifths in new and unusual ways, and he also further developed and extended the symphonic, four-movement, sonata-allegro form. For example, his codas are often perorations and themes and variations on the material of his development section, not simply a winding down of the movement.<br />There are many other things Beethoven did and was notable for, not the least of which was his sense of humour--such as when he stuck a Turkish military band melody with a picolo in the middle of the 9th symphony--making it in fact the key theme of the entire movement; or his piece, Ich Bin Der Schneider Cockadoo (I Am the Taylor's Cockatoo); and the scales the string sections run through in the Lenore Overture number 3.<br />I could go on for a while about Beethoven and why his music was important, but I'll leave it at that for this little review.
B000002H33|5.0|If you think heavy metal is all about how long your hair is, how tight your spandex is, and how high you can scream, I suggest you go out and buy Master of Puppets right now. It will change your mind about heavy metal forever. Metallica have been on top of the heavy metal world throughout most of their career, but its albums like this that make them legends. From the beginning of the opening track, \\"Battery\\", you are warned by the layers of acoustic and spanish guitar harmonies that this is not your typical heavy metal album. But the brilliant symphony of guitars is soon taken over by a storm of distortion, and rips into a galloping thrash metal riff that makes \\"Battery\\" a thrash metal classic, paying tribute to Metallica's old time friends on Battery Street in San Francisco. The next track, \\"Master of Puppets\\", is my favorite song ever. It takes off from the first power chord and doesn't turn back. The faster-than-fast riffing makes the first half of the song a real bruiser, but its not over (not for another 8 minutes!). The maniacal guitar work soon gives in to an acoustic interlude followed by a chilling double-guitar solo. The serenity soon builds back up into one of Kirk Hammett's most brilliant solos ever, putting the finishing touches on one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time. Next is \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", Metallica's first attempt at downtuning. A slow, lumbering cruncher, this tune is one of Metallica's heaviest. Lyrics inspired by Horror/Fiction writer H.P. Lovecraft add to the dark theme. The next song, \\"Welcome Home(Sanitarium)\\" is the album's closest thing to a ballad. The soft intro suggests an easy ride, but the crushing chorus and speed-metal interlude section suggest otherwise. Touching lyrics about the feelings of a mad-man who's been locked away make this song a classic. The highly-overlooked next song, \\"Disposable Heroes\\", is another epic at over 8 minutes. This song touches upon the cruelty of war, and the mistreatment of soldiers. The guitar work sounds as if came straight from the battlefield as well, with its thrash metal speed and heaviness. The following track, \\"Leper Messiah\\", is much like \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" musically. A strange time signature accompanied by heavy, staggering riffs give this song an evil feeling. The lyrics touch upon corrupted evangelists who would do anything for money. Next is this album's instrumental, the brilliant \\"Orion\\". This song is bassist Cliff Burton's claim-to-fame, with its bass oriented middle section. Complex and speedy riffs accompained by dazzling solos break away from stereotypical heavy metal and show a more intelligent and mature side of heavy metal. The final track, \\"Damage, Inc.\\" pulls out all the stops. With its mafia, 'once you're in there's no getting out' theme, Damage Inc. ranks as one of the fastest Metallica tunes ever. It's nothing but pure metal until the final bars, but a perfect finish on the greatest metal album ever. Don't skip a single track. You won't want to miss a second of this masterpiece. This is Metallica at their very best.
0385508417|1.0|My friends said to read this book... So I did, and TBH, I have to categorize it as \\"the worst book I have read all year\\" (and trust me - I read a lot). I am *so* glad I didn't buy this or I would have been furious.<br />The characters are flat, insipid, and uninspiring. The plot is unbelievable and as another reviewer stated, is tailored for a made-for-tv movie, the ending is just plain moronic and to top it off, there's even a little racism for good measure.<br />Thoroughly disappointing. Save your time and your money.

0151008116|5.0|Novels about animals run the risk of over-anthromorphizing the creatures, which can make the book sappy or manipulative (emotionally speaking).  Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" manages to craft a story built largely around a 16-year-old boy and a Bengal tiger.  Not a fluffy, Tigger-like companion, but a real-life 500 pound, hungry tiger.  You're stuck with it on a 23 foot long raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  What do you do?<br />Martel packs quite a bit into the book: Are zoos awful places?  How do you tame tigers?  How do you catch fish in the middle of the ocean?  Do animals get seasick?  Can you be a practicing Christian, Hindu, and Muslim at the same time?<br />Not only that, Martel writes with a true wit.  In describing how the main character's dad ended up going from being a hotelkeeper to a zookeeper, Martel writes: \\"In many ways, running a zoo is a hotelkeeper's worst nightmare.  Consider: the guests never leave their rooms; they expect not only lodging but full board. . . .  One has to wait until they saunter to their balconies, so to speak, before one can clean their rooms, and then one has to wait until they tire of the view and return to their rooms before one can clean their balconies; and there is much cleaning to do, for the guests are as unhygienic as alcoholics.\\"<br />The book sparkles with observations like that, making it very difficult to put down.  Once I got into it about a third of the way, I keep reading until I finished it.  And that was while I was on vacation in Las Vegas!
B000075BFK|3.0|I have to say i disagree with everyone else. This is one of 2pacs worse albums. Not because of the lyrics but because the music is made by different people and in most songs is total [junk]. On a 26 track album I like 3songs. And I am a huge pac fan!
0066214122|4.0|After the dismally pretentious \\"Timeline,\\" Michael Crichton took three years off before coming back with \\"Prey.\\"  And the time off did his writing a lot of good.<br />For the first time since \\"Rising Sun,\\" Crichton writes in the first person, and while his narrator seems little different from, say, the protagonists in \\"Rising Sun\\" or \\"Disclosure\\" (i.e., white male, 35-40, dad), the style works here for a number of reasons.  First, his slowly building suspicions carry you along, propelling you into the narrative.  Second, the reader is not subjected to the pages-long pedantic asides that plagued \\"Timeline\\" (and even \\"Jurassic Park\\").  Of course, there are the techno-touches that make it a Crichton novel, but these are integrated much better into the story.<br />The plot is described well above, and in brief, is as follows: Jack Forman, former Silicon Valley computer programmer, is now a stay-at-home dad while his wife Julia works intense hours at a nanotechnology company.  But Julia is really moody, not to mention, absent much of the time.  She keeps working late, and Jack starts to wonder if she's having an affair.  When she is home, she yells at the kids and at Jack, and then apologizes, only to blow up again later.  Is she cheating on him?  Is she on drugs?  That's only the beginning, as Jack ends up getting called out to the nanotech factory, only to face even worse problems.<br />\\"Prey\\" has something of the feel of a good Dean Koontz novel, like \\"Midnight\\" or \\"Fear Nothing.\\"  In other words, it could be put in the horror section of the bookstore, but isn't really like Stephen King horror.  It's more up the alley of another story about BIG SCIENCE gone bad.
B00005NWM3|3.0|This CD isn't bad, but it's not great.  Nickelback did a pretty good job on this album.  My problem with it is that I only like about half of the songs on it.  The songs &quot;Never Again&quot;, &quot;Too Bad&quot;, &quot;Good Times Gone&quot;, and &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, in my opinion are the best songs on it.  Other than that, the rest of the songs are decent, but they lack something.  I'm not sure what it is, but they are missing something.  I think that &quot;Hero&quot; is the best song that Chad Kroeger has done.  Overall, this is a pretty good CD.
B000002LIM|5.0|i absolutely love this score..because Danny Elfman once again hits no. 1!!!His scores rock!!Every Tim Burton film he has done,<BR>he delivers an outstandingly rousing score!!!Like Mars Attacks!,<BR>Batman Returns,Sleepy Hollow,Edward Scissorhands & the list keeps on going!!!<br />Once again...this score is ace!!!
B00006RAKP|4.0|Sad but true, this collection is supposed to be his last album  until things start changing in the music industry.  At least he'll be going out on a good note though.  This Collection really is great.  I think this is his best album yet.  It's all of his Greatest Hits... What more could you ask for?  I don't like all of the songs on it, so that is why I only gave it four stars instead of five.  Don't get me wrong though, it's still a great collection and a great price.  If you like Elton John at all, buy this set, it has everything an Elton John fan could want, and compared to his other greatest hits collections this one is a lot better.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|This movie is so great. I should spend much more time talking about it than I am going to. If you are frustated by watching this movie you need to see it again and pay careful attention. It is hard for some people to understand but is very rewarding after you grasp everything that is happening. Christopher Nolan was saying alot of things with this movie. Mainly, that we as humans decieve ourselves for our benefit. Do we really want the truth??? I was disturbed by the review that one person gave saying this was the worst movie they had ever seen. There are many films that I have not enjoyed but had to admit that others may enjoy the same movie very much. Memento may not be the movie for a particular person but should not be called a bad movie. Bottom line: Memento is a wonderful mystery. Even after you have solved it you will be able to gather more clues with every viewing. Enjoy!...
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've been an on and off again fan of Christina's. I'm not die hard fan in any means. But her voice always got me....anyhow I didn't know what to expect when I heard this CD....I honestly was expecting \\"dirrty\\" type songs. BUT DAMN was I shocked.......I cannot stop listening to everyone of these songs.....and everyone that has listened to the CD has said the same thing and we're talking about I hate aguilera people and my own mother............everybody is now commending her......My favorites are definitely \\"I'm OK\\" & \\"Walk away\\" My god what soul in those songs..........................The entire cd is great!!

B00000AFWZ|4.0|It may depend on what time period you grew up in to determine whether you will like this compilation or not.  I turned on to rock &amp; roll in early '66, just a month or two before I turned 10.  The best songs on these 4 CDs are not hard to come by.  Songs like &quot;I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)&quot;, &quot;Dirty Water&quot;, &quot;A Question of Temperature&quot;, &quot;Talk Talk&quot;, &quot;Little Girl&quot;, etc. are great rockers.  If you have never heard these songs before and like 60's rock you are going to rock out big time.  The booklet that goes along with this set is good.  It explains why these groups were deep sixed and we ended up having to listen to all the bland, toothless, spurious stuff that came along around 1970.  Not that there weren't good sounding rock songs that followed this era, but still, the originality and creativeness of this era was gone.  The airwaves are more restrictive now.  If you want to hear something different than what you've been hearing the last 10 to 20 years you're just going to have to play it yourself.  What &quot;era&quot; influenced all the rehashed, remixed garbage on the radio in the present day?  I bought a double album called &quot;Wild Thing&quot; over 20 years ago for about 10 bucks.  There are 33 songs on it.  17 of them are on the Nuggets collection with additional songs like &quot;96 Tears&quot;, &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, &quot;Black is Black&quot;, &quot;Gloria&quot;, and &quot;Kicks&quot;.  So if it comes down to the songs on this CD that most people are not familiar with I will say that some do really sound good but some I don't see how you could call garage or punk.  And would someone please make a compilation without &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; on it?  Nearly every 60's various artists CD has this song on it.  What's wrong with &quot;Lil' Red Riding Hood&quot;?  If you want to get all the good rockers from the 60's you're going to have to buy more than this and that's if you don't count the Beatles andStones.  There are songs on these CDs I don't ever remember hearing and some I remember vaguely and some of them really do sound good.  I can appreciate Bill Inglot's desire to be a purist and &quot;present [these songs] in their single form&quot; and &quot;that means mono&quot;, but I for one would rather hear them in stereo.  I say if you can make them sound better do it.  But like I said, the best songs on these 4 volumes I have on about 2 or 3 different CDs that were not hard to come by.  Lots of the songs on here you may never find anywhere else and probably haven't heard of either.  I remembered a few that I hadn't heard since back then and liked.  I can appreciate now what it was like to be hearing these songs when they first came out.  Some of them like &quot;Talk Talk&quot; and &quot;Dirty Water&quot; were rough edged, hard rockers for the time and sounded better to me than all that sweet no. 1 stuff like &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Happy Together&quot;, &quot;Kind of a Drag&quot; and &quot;Somethin' Stupid&quot;.  But be forewarned:  If some of these songs are your old favorites they may not sound as good on this CD as they will on others because they haven't been &quot;stereoized&quot;.  But to all purists I say, enjoy!
B00006F2TV|5.0|I did not have the chance to go see this at the movie since I was moving from Fla to Tx at the time that it was released.. Which does make me sad.. I would loved to have seen this audio/visual extraveganza on the silver screen!<br />First.. I heard that lots of people ditzed the movie for being corny.. And my answer to them is.. Get a grip.. obviously they have never read or seen the original comics.. The humour and dialogue where so Stan (the creator of Spidey)..<br />They could not have gotten a better spider man.. Seems that Jerry must have done some research on the character.. or was himself a fan of the wall crawler..<br />And speaking of the comics.. I am soo glad they chose the Green Goblin as the first villian.. it was outstanding the way they played out the interaction between these two long time enemies..<br />In the long run.. if you have not seen this movie and you are a fan of spiderman the comics then you must do it.. rite now!  You will love it as much as I did..<br />All hail Peter Parker!
067144901X|5.0|This has been my favorite book for my daughter to date!  It is fun to read and she loves it.  She is an easily distracted girl, but she stays with this book and wants to start it over again!  I read the first words, and she fills in the blanks with the animal sounds.  She has so much for with the part, where it says, \\"NO, NO, the pig says . . . .\\"  It is an absolute JOY to read, over and over and over again . . .  And sometimes we recite it even without the book.  Fun!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Well I went and watched phantom menace at the theatre when it first came out and I was just excited and happy to finally see the prequel to my beloved Star Wars..<br />And what I got was a very well done movie that showed the start of Darth Vaders end and the beginning of Obe Wan's legacy..<br />The battle scenes are well done in CGI.. and the costuming and casting is superb for this.<br />There are two reasons that this movie received a 4 instead of a five.. One I felt that they dragged the intro of Anakin out wayyyyyyy to long.. there are a few things that could have been done differently to move it faster.. Second reason.. This like the first movie features actors that are not quite comfortable in there roles and it does show at times..<br />Besides that this is a credit to the original Star Wars Series!
B00006CXSS|5.0|WIth this series, Hanks and Speilberg make &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; just a scratch on the surface of what the whole world should know about WWII.  What makes Band of Brothers most interesting is that these are real accounts based on actions and stories by real people.  The included documentary, featuring interviews with real Easy Company veterans, provides the supporting sense of realism captured in all ten episodes.  Band of Brothers will make you truly admire and respect the men of Easy Company, and all other soldiers who fought the great wars.<br />This is top-notch stuff, particularly the action scenes that stop at nothing to make you feel like you're living the experience. By the end of the ten episodes, you feel like you've developed a bond with each of the characters.  It's that good!<br />Band of Brothers serves as an excellent reminder of a part of our history that should never be forgotten.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|First I will say that I loved the first MIB.. and I was in line the first day that the original movie came out.. On the other hand I am glad that I never saw this in the theatre.. <br />While this was a very enjoyable movie to watch it lacked some of the witty humour of the first movie.. I laughed very few times and in fact at times was like.. what the?  Specially the flush scene.. Cute but, what the heck was up with the cheesy dialogue at the end of the scene?<br />it was nice to see our two agents back in action though.. They came equiped with bigger guns.. and a broader cast of good guys (the worms are back in here)..<br />At times though you do get the feeling that the Director had no idea where he really wanted to go with the movie..
B00001ZULV|3.0|Covers all the bases and then some, one HUGE omission.  Left out No Reply At All which is a top 5 song in My opinion. Little obscure in places for me ie. &quot;Wardrobe&quot; &amp; &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot;
0671015206|5.0|It seems that everyone has a stereotypical view of what a \\"millionaire\\" is.  We see someone drive down the street in that just-came-out-yesterday-brand-new SUV and we think they are very wealthy.  Better yet, we see someone walk out of that exclusive clothing store with a few bags and then hop into that certain SUV.  When we see that person, we assume they are well to do, perhaps a millionaire.  What is so great about The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D. and William D. Danko, Ph.D., is that all of these stereotypes are completely dismissed.<BR> The authors do a great job of illustrating right from the beginning, and even advertising, that everyone is very competent of becoming wealthy.  The main examples of the book came from an interview/survey done by the authors of the book.  The subjects were millionaires, multimillionaires, billionaires, in essence, very wealthy people.  Throughout the entire book, statistics are given that show where these millionaires live, what they drive, what they wear, where there children go to school, etc.  The whole point of this seemed to be that, everyone can accomplish this.  That is where the seven factors to being wealthy come into play.<BR> At the opening section of the book, the survey results are summed up into seven factors that can describe the typical millionaire.  These factors were very eye-opening as each factor is not hard to accomplish.  The completely illustrate in detail each factor; there is a basically one chapter per factor that explains and give examples of how to achieve and how others did achieve in their own personal lives.<BR> Many of these findings seem to be very surprising at first, but in the end, the entire book seems common sense.  This by no means makes this a bad book, if anything, it means it did its job.  The Millionaire Next Door simply shows the obvious ways for anyone, no matter what occupation or social status, to accumulate wealth and become a millionaire.
B00006LPER|5.0|This is not an artsy film.  It's not The Red Violin, Amadeus or The Turning Point.  It is more an intelligent Fatal Attraction without the sensational violence.  The movie explores behavior hidden behind doors:  self-mutilation, masochism, honest sexual desire;  all against a backdrop of classical piano instruction in Vienna.  While the film is graphic at points, this helped me to understand the aforementioned behaviors.  I need to have a better understanding of children who cut themselves, girls that starve themselves, and teens who commit suicide.  This film is a cinematic, daring start.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I love the fact that both the original theatrical release and the &quot;special edition&quot; are included on this DVD (hint, hint Steven Spielberg when it comes time to re-release ET).  There is something magical about the original film--it is truly the most beautiful cartoon ever--but I also love the addition of &quot;Human Again,&quot; a fav tune from the Broadway soundtrack.<br />The quality is fantastic, the extra features are great.  The &quot;tale as old as time&quot; looks and sounds better than it ever did on VHS.  A must for any Disney fan.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Despite some amateurs complaining about this film being in full screen (and not widescreen), please note that widescreens were only invented in 1953 - movies like this one (produced in 1950) were shot in a classic 1:1.33 format, thus naturally filling your old square TV screens. Releasing it in widescreen would actually cut image from the top and bottom, not show more image on the sides. Fullscreen, in this case, is spot on.
B000002GHH|5.0|There is a reason why every review gives this album 5 stars.  If my review can make one more person buy this album than I have contributed to society.<BR>There are songs on this album that survive based on the music alone, with a great backing band to support Hiatt.  But the lyrics, oh! the lyrics!  Noone can express himself as well as John Hiatt.<BR>This album is better with every listen, and believe me, I have listened to this gem at least 500 times.  It contains our wedding song, rocking grooves, touching ballads.  It is a disc you need to spend time listening to, examine the lyrics, enjoy the music.  It would be the best $15 you can spend.
B000069AUI|2.0|coldplay makes bad music. music should be EMOTIONAL. music should make you feel things. also, music should have SOME sort of display of technical ability. these guys' producers are better than they are. anyone can be good if they have good producers and a lot of money.<br />coldplay's music is melodramatic and whiny. their music is devoid of any emotion, because it has been sucked out by excessive production and WAY too many layered tracks upon layered tracks.<br />furthermore, they are very similar to radiohead, too much to ignore... which is a shame, because radiohead is such a great band. the difference is, radiohead can a) actually play their instruments well, and b) actually write really good songs, instead of trying to make up for their lack of songwriting with production and cheesy string sections.<br />the only reason that coldplay deserves two stars is that at least they're not nu-metal.
B00006CXXU|4.0|If you are looking for another pop-driven record with dance beats and twink inspired ballads from Christina Aguilera, don't hold your breath.  This is definitely different from her self-titled debut album.  This is more of a rock chick driven album, using producers like Linda Perry (4 Non Blondes, Pink), and even collaborating with Alicia Keys.  Although her debut album was kind of tame, this album will eventually establish her as a vocal powerhouse with the likes of Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and even Aretha Franklin.  This is definitly a grown-up Christina, addressing adult issues, and even using a little adult adjectives!  Overall, this is a coming out of a shell for Christina.  I think it is going to be a classic, because it is so personal of an album.  It is worthy to be in your personal collection, even if it has to share a place with Eminem!
B000003TAR|5.0|Singer, songwriter and guitarist Kurt Cobain was obviously an unhappy and troubled soul for many years. His bipolar disorder, intense stomach pains and drug addictions wouldn't help to make things any better. So here, on _In Utero_, Kurt Cobain lays his troubled soul bare, as he and company make an intense, abrasive and uncompromising album - from start to finish. It's very painful to listen to this - especially when knowing that Kurt would take his own life just months after this hit the shelves. \\"Serve The Servants\\" is an abrasive rocker with bittersweet melodies and hooks. \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" features some disturbing lyrics and Kurt's enraged screams. \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" was the big hit of the album. It features interesting plays-on-words (\\"She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak\\"/\\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\"). \\"Rape Me\\" was the controversial track on the album - which possibly earned _In Utero_ the latent \\"PARENTAL ADVISORY\\" sticker on some pressings. There is no profanity, but, I believe the track has to do with Nirvana's reluctance to enter the mainstream, but they were \\"raped\\" when their smash hit _Nevermind_ took them right where they didn't want to be. \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\" contrasts soft and explosive moments with a haunting and ominous melody sung by Kurt (\\"I miss the comfort in being sad\\"). For anyone who doesn't know who and what the story is with Frances Farmer - here it goes: She was an actress who was sent for a long stay in a mental hospital by her parents (rumor has it that she really didn't belong there in the first place). \\"Dumb\\" is the short, mellow and cello-laden track. \\"Very Ape\\" is a short rocker with groove. \\"Milk It\\" is the only track on here containing profanity  .... \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" almost seems like an unconventional ballad. Features very poignant melodies underneath the edgy guitar parts. \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" is an ominous, abrasive and experimental track featuring a large amount of distortion and feedback. Kurt Cobain even makes a lyrical reference to his illness (\\"Bipolar opposites attract\\"). \\"Tourette's\\" is the most 'punk-ish' on here - a short, fast-paced rocker with Kurt Cobain yelling indecipherable lyrics. Strangely - buried underneath all that chaos is a melody reminiscent of old '50's rock 'n roll music. \\"All Apologies\\" is seen by many as Kurt Cobain's 'curtain call'. The haunting line \\"married, buried, married, buried\\" seems very ironic.<br />_In Utero_ is a difficult and painful album to listen to - especially (as I've noted above) after knowing Kurt Cobain would be gone very shortly after this album's release. It's abrasive, intense, violent, angry, sad, haunting, ironic and poignant - all at once. However, this album is a good indication of what was, is and always will be - Nirvana.e amount of distortion and feedback.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|I teach fine arts in a high scool, and they thought theatre would be uptight and boring.  This proved them wrong.  It made believers out of them in the magic, beauty, &amp; awe of theatre.  They didn't want to go to see the play locally because it was during a holiday &amp; they didn't want to spend the money on somehting so &quot;useless.&quot;  Now they're begging their parents to give them tickets as an early Christmas gift!  They loved it.  If it can convert pessimistic teenagers, it's gotta be good!
B000002AP1|5.0|The rumor about this album is that the Stooges blew their advance money for this album on drugs, and in an impaired state, accidently mixed everything except the vocals down to one track during the mixing process, then called Bowie in to try and salvage it. I tend to believe that story because that's what RP sounds like. I did an A/B comparison with this VS the original. and like this one better.
6305078181|4.0|it's amazing that langella doesn't once use fake fangs in the movie, yet still completely manages to emulate the count (based of course on vlad dracula/vlad tepes/vlad the impaler) in both bloodthirsty nature against enemies and noble public image.  his acting style bridges the gap between the fictional count dracula and the real prince dracula of walachia.  although the other actors/actresses also performed magnificently in their roles, the special effects were by no means able to compete with modern technology, yet the theatrical-style performances by all actors (langella mostly) gave the film a much more truthful sense to it.  i must admit that despite the special effects found in modern renditions, i tend to still prefer this older version of dracula as the most \\"realistic\\" portrayal and closest interpretation of the real dracula portrayed as the fictional count.  my thanks to langella for his (again, counting theater)entrancing performance as the count.
B000001E7T|5.0|When I buy this album I not listen so much, because is freak in compare to other pj's albums. But time pass and slow down this cd is one of the favourite in my colection. It's sad and intense, the dark side of harvey probably. This \\"to bring you my love\\" it's necesary in every music fan collection.
0375823360|5.0|I recently received the boxed set as a gift and quickly devoured it. An amazing little triad about two youngsters stuck in an epic battle between the good of wisdom and the evil of willful ignorance. And if you ever wanted an answer for the problem of evil, here it is in a nutshell. In fact, Pullman's god is probably more consistent with reality than any pseudo-god of the Bible. Christians will be left wondering: but if there's no \\"God,\\" what's there to hope for, how can I live my life, how can I make sense of anything? And that's exactly the point of the books: reality is big and complicated, and the only thing we have to count on is reality itself. For parents, these books will provide many hours of stimulating conversation about religion, ethics, and so much more. They will prove valuable, too, in tying in the horrors of the mythical church in its pages to the long, sordid history of Christian destruction in this real world (and current day scandals). So too can the books lead to an appreciation of the good some believers have done in this world in things like art and literature (Milton is, after all, the source of the series title!). For children, it will be a wonderful fantasy full of magical creatures and powers and cool adventures. It will make Narnia seem like a drab Saturday morning cartoon (sorry Mr. Tumnus). One warning though: the books are more suited for teenagers and precocious pre-teens. Some of the writing and vocabulary can become dense and there's plenty of violence.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is a band whose music is pretty hard to label. They've been called everything from metal, to numetal, to alternative and progressive rock/metal. While they exhibit attributes to all of the aforementioned genres, it's pretty safe to say that they've created a kind of music that's timeless, transcendent, deep, mysterious, forbidding and intriguing - all at once. To me, their name sums up the music they make perfectly - a \\"tool\\" for exploring the mysterious depths of the human psyche. The music usually explores darker themes like pain, anger, frustration and guilt, then regurgitates them into a volatile, yet beautiful and alluring catharsis.<br />How do I describe Tool's music?<br />I'd say they have the dark aura and minimalist experimentalism of King Crimson, the philosophical bent of Rush and the hypnotic, alluring quality of Pink Floyd - without really sounding like either of those bands. They possess their own distinctive sound.<br />On _Ænima_, Tool creates a 77-minute gargantuan slice of thought-provoking art-metal, which mainly encourages people to look deeper and think for themselves - whether it be looking beyond the surface of cliched beliefs (examples: what people are taught to believe in church, or what's seen and absorbed from television and more). When the mind is open to 'too' much outer influence, the mind is 'dead' - therefore, you lack your own thoughts and \\"you\\" no longer belong to \\"you\\".<br />Musically, the album is dark and given to adventurous, elaborate and spatial instrumentation - along with eerie and mysterious interludes. The opening track \\"Stinkfist\\" is a heavy and fairly straightforward rocker. Maynard James Keenan has one of the most distinctive and ethereal voices in rock today -- displaying the innocent, sad, poignant and reflective quality of Joni Mitchell one minute, then exploding into a frighteningly explosive scream the next, which can evoke Chucky, the doll (see the horror film \\"Child's Play\\", voiced by actor Brad Dourif). \\"Eulogy\\" begins with some spoon-like percussion and eerie guitar lines (which evoke King Crimson). It then turns into an explosive rocker. Maynard's vocals are particularly beautiful and impressive here. (Note: if you're new to this, don't make the mistake of thinking the percussive opening lasts forever - it doesn't). \\"H\\" showcases guitar ambience, tribal-like rhythms (from drummer Danny Carey) and explosive sections. \\"Useful Idiot\\" is the short interlude (which sounds like an ending of a scratched record) that segues into \\"Forty Six & Two\\", which is probably the most popular Tool track on this album. \\"Message To Harry Manback\\" is an interlude of an angry immigrant badmouthing the American nationality (which I find quite hilarious). \\"Hooker With A Penis\\" is pure confrontational metal at it's best. I think lyrically, this has to do with the music business (and the whole \\"selling-out\\" thing). It may have had something to do with a fan accusing Tool of doing just that. \\"Intermission\\" is a short keyboard piece (evoking that of a sports/arena anthem). It's actually a short 'keyboard' version (or opening) for the next track \\"Jimmy\\". This along with the rest of the tracks are the most \\"elaborate\\" on the disc. \\"Die Eier Von Satan\\" (German for \\"The Eggs Of Satan\\") is a recipe spoken in German. The backing music sounds almost industrial/death metal-like, containing shrieks and sadistic \\"slaps\\". \\"Pushit\\" is a heavy rocker, which shows off Danny Carey's complex, precise and intricate rhythms on the drum kit. Some of Maynard's vocals here reach ranges that weren't heard anywhere else (on this disc, or on any other Tool album). His Gaelic-ish vocals near the end (backed by a guitar/bass progression of 5th's) are truly poignant. \\"Cesaro Summability\\" sounds like guitar/amplifier feedback - fronted by baby screams. \\"Ænema\\" is a profane, dissonant heavy rocker, with snaky rhythms galore. Maynard James Keenan describes the city of Los Angeles - and says that it should receive an \\"enema\\" -- flushing it all away. \\"(-)Ions\\" is an eerie, dissonant and whirry interlude. I personally find this ethereal. \\"Third Eye\\" probably sums up what this album and Tool's music stands for in general -- thinking for yourself. The beginning dialogue features a sample taken from one of comedian Bill Hicks' standup routines. He says that many people denounce drugs - yet drugs have done something powerful for us - they've helped 'some' musicians provide us diehard music fans with what many of us consider \\"the best music of all-time\\" (examples: The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Who - these are only a handful of 'revered' bands that have had certain members of each use drugs before). The 'third eye' is referred to as the human brain. Like the actual human 'eye', it absorbes and processes things (for benefit or detriment). When to 'open' (take in, absorb, believe) and 'close' (neglect, reject, refuse) the organ is our choice. The music on here features many instrumental and experimental twists and turns throughout it's 13-minute playing time.<br />_Ænima_ is an album that can take weeks, months and years to decipher. The lyrical and musical complexity is nearly infinite - to an almost unfathomable degree. It's an album you can listen to for years and still find new things to discover -- lyrically, musically and thematically. Tool has created music that can only be called timeless, transcendent, infinite and futuristic. _Ænima_ is a timeless masterpiece. Highly recommended.\\"enema\\" -- flushing it all away. \\"(-)Ions\\" is an eerie, dissonant and whirry interlude.

B000002HRE|5.0|I simply HATE primitive people. They are writing Metallica off, because Metallica changes, as the band is getting older. My God, do you all live in the '80s? It is not that I do not enjoy early Metallica albums (Ride The Lightning is their best album, I think), but I get sick of stupid reviews that say Metallica have sold out and they are not doing speed or trash metal. Of course they are not doing speed or trash metal - they are almost 40 years old and have already played a lot of hard music in the '80s. Now they are trying something different, and that is great. (Although Metallica have never ever made two albums that are not completely different!). I don't like people comparing one Metallica album to another, each album is different and that is what makes this band so great. Go listen to stupid headbangers like Slayer, Pantera or Marilyn Manson. These bands express no emotions, they play hard, heavy music and that not good, because after the 2nd, the 3rd or the 15th album it will get very monotonistic. These are called \\"classics\\", hahahah, even Godsmack are far better than these mindless people. Metallica are by far the greatest band ever, and Load and ReLoad prove this.<BR>And about Napster. People swear at Metallica because they were against Napster. Well, that's the right thing a band should do when their music is spread illegally. That's it. Now about ReLoad:<br />I have always been wondering why is it that Metallica are the one and only metal band on Earth, that can make people, who have never listened to metal before, love their music. The answer is quite difficult to find. I think almost every Metallica song has a FEELING that overcomes you while you are listening to them. This feeling is easy to discover: the incredible riffs in Master Of Puppets, the chorus in The Four Horsemen, the beginning of Battery, and so on... Load did not lack this feeling and I am glad to say ReLoad does not as well! Just listen to Fuel (\\"and on I burn\\") or Fixxxer (\\"can you hear what father's done?\\") or Low Man's Lyric, one of the BEST METALLICA SONGS EVER (\\"the trash fire is warm\\"). Who cares Slither and Bad Seed are songs that have really never been heard from Metallica before (in their style, I mean)? Who cares Better Than You is just an old-school rock song? (Actually, it is not, just listen to it carefully - and of cousre, with Hetfield singing, it CAN'T be a bad song).<BR>Shortly, this is a great album with many new elements in Metallica's life (Where The Wild Things Are is a goodexample) and with fantastic songs like Low Man's Lyric, The Unforgiven II, Fuel, Fixxxer or Carpe Diem Baby.<BR>Once again, if you think Metallica are not true artists and are selling out (and my favorite: they're writing radio-friendly songs) then go listen to those bands mentioned above. The future of metal music is what Metallica are doing right now. Be glad that you can buy their new albums and you can listen to them live. They are living history.
B000066NW0|5.0|When Avril first came out with her song &quot;Complicated,&quot; I really enjoyed listening to this on MTV.  The music video really showed how people live and how they like to do the weirdest things (kind of sounds like myself....lol).  Anyway, then Sk8er Boi came out and really showed some destructiveness in the world, but I enjoyed the song, and still do today.<br />Now, what happens when Avril's upbeat music hits into her Ballad &quot;I'm With You?&quot;  I loved it!  After listening to these three songs, I finally decided to get the CD, and I haven't been disappointed at all.<br />Each song has its own special type of flavor that really sets it apart from others.  Here are the songs in order and how I like them (1-5 stars):<br />1) Losing Grip: This definitely sounds like Avril's style.  It has a great music base to it, and it really talks about people and letting others down.  5 stars.<br />2) Complicated: Uh, we've all heard this song, so I don't need to explain it.  I love it still, though.  4 stars.<br />3) Sk8er Boi: As I said before, I loved the song, especially the message behind it.  5 stars.<br />4) I'm With You: This is one of her more mellow songs (as I said before), and it sounds really good.  Has a good meaning on its lyrics as well.  5 stars.<br />5) Mobile: Still has the same sound as normal, but isn't as catchy as her others before.  3 stars.<br />6) Unwanted: More punk rock involved in this track, and it sounds very upbeat and has a great melody to it.  Probably one of my most favorite songs on the CD.  5 stars.<br />7) Tomorrow: A little more of a ballad song, and has a good sound because it's more acoustic than punk.  4 stars.<br />8) Anything But Ordinary: ....is a good song as well, but I usually skip this song.  2 stars.<br />9) Things I'll Never Say: Yeah, I guess all the songs can't be the greatest, and this one has a good melody (especially the chorus), but it's not my most favorite either.  3 stars.<br />10) My World: Typical rock, butisn't like her normal songs.  It has more of a catchy rock sound to it, but it's almost too peppy...lol.  4 stars.<br />11) Nobody's Fool: I like this song because the verses are spoken, not sung, and the chorus has a great melody to it.  And Avril really knows how to speak on this one.  5 stars.<br />12) Too Much To Ask: Not the typical Avril song either, but this is probably next to Anything But Ordinary on the CD.  I usually skip this song.  2 stars.<br />13) Naked: This is probably one of the best songs on the CD (next to Unwanted and I'm With You).  It has a good meaning to it and a good music feel to it.  5 stars.<br />Overall, this CD is definitely worth your money.  I hope she comes up with another one later in her career.  She rocks!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is an amazing piece of work and proves that Christina Aguilera is a major talent. This album has everything, pop, rock, soul, r&b and even gospel. I know most people will be turned off by \\"DIRRTY\\" and think Christina is another trashy pop [singer],but it is not the case here. Although i must admit DIRRTY is my favourite track(i wish it had done better in the U.S),i defintley was not expecting such a mature adult contemporary sound,with songs that have alot more meaning than her previous teenybopper tracks(What a girl wants,Genie in a bottle),the songs on this album really show Christina's feelings and emotions about herself,her past and her present. Producing a sound in some songs that is very different and unfamiliar to her usual pure pop hits,we get to see what Christina Aguilera is really made of. There really isn't even one song that is bad on this album,each one has its own style. STRIPPED defintley proves Christina's talent and shows that she has finally broken the teenybopper phase.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin the best band in music history.<BR>Led Zeppelin IV the best album of zep.<BR>LZ IV the best album in the history of music.<BR>Is an album miscelaneous in intensity, it just climb a mountain and down again, you climb with \\"black dog\\" and \\"rock n roll\\", and down that with \\"four stick\\" or the epic \\"the battle of evermore\\" (the only song in the zepp carreer that singns a women in chorus) and climb the mountain again with \\"misty mountain hop\\" and you keep up with the fantastic \\"stairway to heaven\\", and one of the best zepp songs, \\"going to california\\". The album end's with the hard rocker \\"when the leeve breaks\\". <BR>If you are a recently led zeppelin fan, this album you must to buy, because is the best..
B00006CXXU|5.0|My cousin bravely bought this album as I was taunting and teasing her all the way through the checkout, and let me just say, I began eating my words the moment we listened to it.  I am NOT a fan of Christina's nor Britney's nor any of the boy bands...but this is not crappy or plastic like those typically and generally annoying so-called musicians...no, this is an amazing musical experience that sets Christina apart from her peer crowd!  I guess i was expecting cheap, trite,  stereotypical and demeaning lyrics, but this CD is QUITE the opposite!  By the third song I felt extremely empowered!  Thank god for women who tell it and sing it like it is...so passionate, feisty, and beautiful!  The sound is also incredible...the entire album was mixed very well...it splendidly shows off Christina's amazing vocal talents.  For all of the Christina loathers or anyone who is not quite sure they want to take a chance on this album, I strongly suggest giving it a listen.  You just might be surprised.
B000002HMH|5.0|I do not want to talk anymore about foolish things like Metallica are selling out and that this album is weak and not metal and so on... go read my review about Reload to see my opinion about these mentioned above, this is going to be a short review.<br />Load is a great album. It contains a very wide variety of songs. True heavy ones like Wasting My Hate or the fantastic The House Jack Built. Many songs are difficult to categorize (Until It Sleeps, Ronnie, Poor Twisted Me) but still sound perfect. There is no weak song here, and the best song in Metallica's history is on this album: The Outlaw Torn. You have to listen to this song at least once in your life. I recommend the S&amp;M version for second listening, then you can decide which is better.<br />That's it, Metallica have continued their string of fantastic records with Load. Thumbs up for the best band ever!
B00005YUTD|2.0|I agree with the other reviewers, Baby Mozart is the best of the series.  The problem with Baby Bach, Baby Santa's Music Box (the two others I have seen so far) is that there are scenes with children in them.  My daughter is not at all interested in the people scenes for some reason.  She loves all the movement and all the toys, and in the Bach series, there simply aren't as many moving toy scenes.  (Same goes for Baby Santa which is definitely the WORST of Baby Einstein.)<br />I think the thing that bothers me the most about Baby Bach is that Julie Clark puts her children in it, and frankly, I find it to be the MOST annoying part of the show, thank goodness it's only for a few minutes.  Trying too hard to be cutesy, believe me, it's not at all cute.<br />In buying the Baby Einsten tapes / DVDs (in general) I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised at my daughters reaction.  She is captivated by the (moving) scenery, it's amazing to see a five month old so interested, I almost want to videotape her watching it, yes it's that cute.  And I think you will be thrilled, too, when you see your child interact.<br />Should you buy this one?  Sure, it's one of the better Baby Einstein tapes, but it's not the best.  I think the original Baby Mozart is by far the best.  They should stick to the original format.
B00006YXEK|4.0|First, the music.  This album feels like a parting gift from George to his loyal fans.  There is not a hit single, and nothing jumps out as a classic, but these songs are precious nuggets not will not disappoint with repeated listenings.  It's a calm, steady, relaxing album - no surprises, no disapointments.  It's hard to even pick highlights, but Any Road, Rising Sun, and Stuck Inside a Cloud are my favorites.<br />Jeff Lynn's production is, well, Jeff Lynn's production.  I've never liked his production style, but with his involvment with George, the Wilburys and the Beatles, I've had to acquire a taste for it.  For the most part, it does not interfere with the pure simplicity of Harrison's performances.<br />As far as using the word \\"bonus\\" with this edition, well, let's just say that it is the record company (and maybe the Harrison estate) that is getting the \\"bonus\\" from us, the buyer.  The DVD runs just about as long as Hey Jude, and the \\"poster\\", pick and sticker are certainly not worth the bucks, but nice to have all the same. Still, for all the extra money, all but the most fanatical would be well-advised to stick to the CD-only version.<br />Despite the reservations expressed, this is not a posthumous cash-in collection.  This is a first-class release, worthy of both the man and his legacy.  His music will no doubt live on, and the Brainwashed album will be a vital part of it.  His final music is transcendent, as near a message from beyond as can come from one who was living between two worlds, still among the living on earth but knowing he was soon to take his place in Eternity.  More than any of the other Beatles, more than almost anybody, George's work was always filled with an integrity, depth and spirituality that was his alone.  I'm now listening to the album for the third time, and it grows on me like a beautiful sunset, fading in the twilight.  Very peaceful, flowing, yet supremely challenging. Rest in peace, Mr. Harrison.
B000075BFK|5.0|We love 2PAC and his new album is the a must have, from Ghetto Star( a realistic look at what Thugz think about plus a hot track) to still ballin', disc 2 is ok, but disc one is hotttt. All toghether this album is very much worth getting.
0446677450|5.0|The principles espoused by RTK in tnis first of the Rich Dad series are fabulous if only you will open your mind to new information.I was opposed to RD/PD at first too because it went against everything that I was taught in my formative years. But then I realized that nobody who taught me the &quot;normal/conventional&quot; way of getting ahead were doing all that well themselves.Since reading RD/PD I have started my own business and begun an investing program in equities and real estate.Great book Mr. K. Keep them coming.
B000063S6Z|5.0|O. K. I just bought this CD and I am in love. I have never bought a Moby CD before but I will be sure and  go back and buy more. Yes,  it is more swaying music than say dance,  and yes it is spritual but most of all it is magical. How can he be compared to Eminim? Why would Em even take stabs at  Moby? Em must have ego issues. This music is up lifting, healing, and pure star dust.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I heard wonder boy and was hooked instantly to Jack black's voice and kyle g's melody (well both of them)<BR>this cd is fantastic im a 17 year old girl and i just love it.<BR>very clever for being so-called gimick performers.  They sound better than the &quot;Real&quot; (whatever that means) rock bands<BR>anyway i would recommend it is very good.

B0000004WM|4.0|Ah, Samantha Fox. She was an 80's pin-up queen, notorious for her days as a topless Page 3 model in the UK. She's also quite notorious for what could only be called 'sleazy cheese'. Campy pop songs with a naughty vibe in them sung by a naughty girl.<BR>   Naughty Miss Fox opens the album up with the thumping club cut 'Hurt Me! Hurt Me! (But The Pants Stay On)'. Silly and sleazy is the tune she's playing here, and she plays it so well. Fun continues on with a medley of the disco classics 'More More More' and 'Love To Love You Baby', done in true Fox style. A clubby pop cut 'Don't Wait Up', is a good track too, and is followed  by the title cut, which is a funkier R&amp;B attempt.<BR>   Sam's next track sort of reminds me of Janet Jackson's 'Escapade', and is called 'Pleasure Zone'. The rest of this album all falls along the same vein as these tracks, fun club pop from the early 90's. More good examples of this includes 'Don't Cry Wolf' and 'Saving It Up', the latter of which reminds me of the Pebbles single 'Giving You The Benefit'.<BR>   Now there is one chunk of rather stinky cheese wedged in this fun little collection. The not necessarily bad 'Spirit Of America' is weak, in it's attempt at faux- patriotism. Sam's a Brit babe, why sing an ode to us? Very odd really. Not bad, but just, well, strange.<BR>   I think it'd be really fun if Samantha Fox made a comeback. Hey, crazier things have happened. Fun little pop effort.

Ever since they burst on the scene a year ago with the wonderfully assured Parachutes, they have won legions of followers with their heartfelt songs, beautiful melodies, and just all-round refreshing musicianship. With their sophomore effort, A Rush Of Blood To The Head, Coldplay have refined their songcraft. Not nessecarily by making it more accsesible, but by making a more mature record which keeps you listening for hours on end, subtleties being revealed with each listen ('Clocks'). The CD isn't that short (around 55 minutes) but one feels as if the record has barely started when the lush piano chords of the last song 'Amsterdam' hit. Chris Martin has polished his voice, to the extent that any Thom Yorke comparison should immediately be put to rest. The lyrics, as well are definitely a step up from Parachutes (\\"you were an island and I passed you by\\"). Jonny Bucklan's work, in particular, is fascinating. He adds an unmistakeable texture to Coldplay's sound. For further proof, just listen to \\"God Put A Smile On Your Face\\". Each song could be a single, it's that good. To illustrate my point, I shall give a track-by-track listing of this album<br />Politik - This one song encapsulates the growth of the band since their last record. A \\"it-will-grow-on-you\\" song, pretty impressive lyrics (though the \\"open up your eyes\\" chorus DOES sound cliched). A terrific album opener, sustained violins and metronome drum beats being the driving forced behind this song.<br />In My Place - In my opinion, the weakest song on this album. How this song was chosen as a single is beyond me. It is the one song, where the band does not display any growth at all. Yeah, I suppose the guitar figure is slightly charming, but nothing beyond that. Doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the album<br />God Put A Smile On Your Face - One of my favorite songs on the album. One of the very few songs on this album without piano. A simple guitar figure kicks this song off,but Jonny Buckland's amazing electric guitar work, Chris Martin's soaring vocals (you cant help but sing the \\"..your guess is as good as mine\\" part along with him) and the unusual but highly effective basswork from Guy Berryman lend the status of \\"standout\\" to this song.<br />The Scientist - Another absolutely gorgeous track. Chris Martin accompanies himself on the piano, before the band joins him. A wonderful melody lends this song a certain poignancy. You can't help but wonder what the band was doing by not releasing this song first up as a single, instead of \\"In Your Place\\"<br />Clocks - It took me some time to get into this song. An inventive piano figure first up, with pleasant harmonies supporting Chris Martin's rather somber lyrics. Martin uses his falsetto brilliantly in the chorus. Another standout.<br />Daylight - The drone of a 12-string guitar starts of this uncharasterically busy track. Despite some awkard phrasing (like a newborn/chiiiiilldddddd-uh), the melody of the verse and the propulsiveness of the chorus make this a particluarly memorable track.<br />Green Eyes - With a lone acoustic guitar and Chris Martin's echoey vocals, this song has a bare, sparse feeling to it. Not that that's bad, but the lack of any noticable hooks or climax makes it a rather forgettable song, and you'll find yourself pressing the 'skip' button. I know I did.<br />Warning Sign - Another one of my personal faves, and another example of Jonny Buckland's exemplary guitar work. Wonderful, sing-along melody. I just love the way the band jumps in without warning after 4 bars. An obvious standout, and one of the two songs (the other being 'God put A Smile On Your Face') to abstain from piano. Why Chris Martin didn't want this song on the album is way beyond me.<br />A Whisper - Another one of the 'busy' tracks. Nothing special about it, but nothing ordinary enough to make you skip it. Nice, melodious chorus.<br />A Rush Of Blood To The Head - An under-rated track, in my opinion. Contains one of the best choruses of the year.<br />Amsterdam - Can you say 'perfect album closer'? Truly wonderful song, Chris Martin sounds as if he's going to cry any minute. The track has a spacey, atmospheric feel. Wonderful harmonies, a perfect track to end an excellent album<br /> All in all, with the exception of 2 tracks, this is an absolute gem of an album. One that you can listen to casually, or study in detail. It keeps your interest to the very end. Those who want to download some songs before they buy the album, I would reccomend starting with 'God Put Smile On Your Face', 'The Scientist', 'Warning Sign' and 'Amsterdam, these being the obvious, and most accessible highlights.<BR> Buy the album, one of the best of the year..
0553573403|5.0|In my top 0.3% of all books read out of around 1200 or so.<br />Enlightened.<br />If you like fantasy, this one is hard core.  <br />Probably for mature readers.  Realistic portrayals of human behavior.  <br />Gritty, yet beautiful.
B00006CXXU|3.0|a lot of these reviews say \\"i never thought i'd like this, but i did\\" and i guess i feel the same way. if you'd have told me a month ago i was gonna listen to christina and like it enough to buy it, i may well have smacked your mouth. i always thought she was a good singer, but didn't like her songs.<br />STRIPPED definitely has its moments, thanks mostly to some wise production choices in the studio and help from great songwriters & musicians. \\"beautiful\\" is probably the greatest track here, and i can't think of a better title to describe it. it is simple and its message touched my heart. i picked up my guitar and learned it after hearing it, it's one of those great songs. incidentally, it was written by linda perry, who in addition to helping write several other songs on STRIPPED, was responsible for writing pink's MISUNDAZTOOD album.<br />other shining tracks are \\"impossible\\", which was co-written with alicia keys, and boy can you tell. \\"soar\\", another catchy tune written by perry, is radio-friendly and even resembles something you might hear someone like faith hill do. \\"fighter\\" sounds like janet jackson's \\"black cat\\" and features guitar by janes addiction's dave navarro. the roots' amir \\"?uestlove\\" thompson plays drums on a few tracks as well (get d'angelo VOODOO or nikka costa's EVERYBODY GOT THEIR SOMETHING for more of his incredible drumming). \\"walk away\\" sounds like a watered-down version of fiona apple's \\"shadowboxer\\". \\"cruz\\" is christina's shakira-like song.<br />this album at the very least demonstrates several different styles, even if they're not so original-sounding. i liked that, and i think christina is headed in the right direction. she just needs to learn restraint like the classic singers have (listen to cassandra wilson or jill scott) and quit the endless trilling. she could learn a lot from amir thompson about how to play \\"in the pocket\\".
B00005RFQ5|1.0|Prince has always mixed outstanding music with trite, embarrassing, or just plain silly lyrics. He also has an unfortunate predilection for twisting knobs on the mixing board to speed up or slow down vocals, or add distracting textures or effects to songs that would sound much better without the extra flavors. Usually it is possible to ignore the decoration to get to the music. Not this time.  Paradoxically, some of his best music in years is buried under and made unlistenable by lugubrious voice-overs,recording tricks,and his most tediously didactic sermon ever. In the immortal words of Father Zappa, \\"Shut up and play your guitar!\\"
B00006879E|5.0|This cd is really really cool, and a really good cd to chill to.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped was a very good album.Not as bubblegum music as the first,it's more of a real album.I enjoyed it.I relate to it in a lot of ways.Everyone buy this album
B000002ADT|5.0|'Kind of Blue' is one of many truly great Jazz albums, and there is no doubt that Miles brought something totally original into the world with this album(Modal Jazz, yes, but it goes beyond that, somehow). Having said that, all the hype about this album gets a bit annoying, and I think that it actually decreased my appreciation of the music. For example, on the back of the cd case, it says &quot;If this is your first encounter with 'Kind of Blue', be forewarned that its likely to become an indespensible part of your life&quot;. I'm sorry, but if you have not listened to the album yet and you read that, it pretty much kills the mood. It is an increadible album, however, and I simply love Coltrane's solos. If you do not like Jazz music, however, I don't see how this album will make you like it. You really do have to have a deep appreciation of good music in general to understand what the musicians are trying to convey.
B000000WA4|5.0|YET ANOTHER GODLY PIECE OF WORK BY THE CHICAGO FOURSOME! How does such an amazing album get created? SP is spread out completely. You have Hardcore, Ballads, Hard Rock, Metal, Dance, and Pop-Rock all in one. What other band does this? No one! Well, maybe The Beatles. Billy Corgan has such a stunning voice. Every time I hear it, it's completely recognizable, and I say &quot;Amazing!&quot;. James Iha's guitar work is off the wall, with D'Arcy's bass lines to set everything up, and Jimmy on the drum to crash everything down. The singles are some of the best songs on the album I'd say, but every song is completely different than one another. The fact that a double-album was perfected is a rarity in itself, and should not go unnoticed. The award for best Progressive Psychadelic Rock band without a shadow of a doubt, is rewarded to The Smashing Pumpkins. Can't wait til Zwan's album comes out January 28th!
B00005J73X|5.0|ONE WILD NIGHT LIVE is a great collection of live recordings from throughout Bon Jovi's career. It starts with \\"It's My Life\\" from the then-current CRUSH album, and goes on to include material from all of the group's tours up to that point. There are also a couple of surprise cover versions- \\"Neil Young's \\"Rockin' In The Free World\\" and Bob Geldof's \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\" (which features Bob himself). This is a better introduction to Bon Jovi than CROSS ROAD could ever be.
B00006RU5B|1.0|The breakup of RATM represents the critical flaw of progressive politics in the US--countless bickering and infighting weakening the ability to educate via a powerful mass media channel. Opportunities RATM had only come once in awhile. Their inability to set aside their personal differences for the good of their political agenda is truly a causality for progressive politics in the United States. It truly saddens me to see the rise of an &quot;Audioslave&quot; and the demise of a &quot;Rage Against the Machine.&quot;
B00005JL96|5.0|Trust me, parents, Lilo & Stitch is a treat. This is one to own. It is an adventure across the galaxy.  It is a lighthearted tale of a fuzzy little anti-hero and moral lessons learned. It is a spectacular watercolor.  It is a celebration of the beautiful Hawaiin islands and their culture.  It is the best animated Disney summer blockbuster since the Lion King.  <br />Stitch is Experiment 626, an alien designed to wreak destruction and chaos.  He is a little too good at havoc  so good that the Council has decided that he is too dangerous for their society.  Before they can exile him on an asteroid, he escapes his makers and takes refuge on Earth (which is a wildlife reserve where his pursuers must capture him without harming the locals or making a scene).  There he takes up with Lilo, a cute little Hawaiian girl with behavioral problems of her own.  Pretty soon they become an adorable pair of holy terrors around town while bounty hunters lie in wait for an opportunity to reclaim Stitch.<br />At first I was skeptical that Lilo & Stitch could be any good after a string of box-office bombs from Disney in the last 6 years.  Well, whatever creative slump they were in, the writers and creative forces have redeemed themselves at last.  Returning to a softer visual style with vivid watercolors and rounded designs seems to have worked well with the peppy little story here.  Stitch himself is just too cute, despite naughty hijinks aplenty.  And even though there is a sentimental steak running through the film a mile wide, I never once found myself wishing for that bucket.  <br />The DVD version has some fun bonus material, including deleted scenes which have some delightful raw sketches in areas, as though a ghostly afterimage was infused with life and action. Dont miss the trailers (the Aladdin version is a hoot).  There is an educational bit about Hawaii and Hula dancing included, and we are treated to a behind-the-scenes making of the film through all stages.  Finally,a DVD rom game is waiting.   Dont be afraid to buy this DVD, it is sure to return your moneys worth in entertainment.
B000069CWE|2.0|First thing I have to say, &quot;What a disappointment&quot;. During the beginning of the summer of this year, I was sooooooo impatiently awaiting the release of this album. Ever since the Spring of 2001 (When I first saw the video for One Step Closer), I was obsessed with Linkin Park. Personally, I think they are the best nu-metal band to ever emerge (maybe next to KoRn). But, something went wrong. It's a thing called exposure. I blame this album's problems on the record industry taking advantage of such a great band. When the single &quot;In The End&quot; came out, it was a pop sensation. That's where it started to go down hill. When you have a good band play their music on TRL or pop-radio, it is giving the message &quot;Hey, I actually have talent instead of everyone else that is played on this station, listen to me&quot;. That isn't a bad thing. But, the misinterpretation of that is. Now, Linkin Park are on the same wavelength as *N Sync. It's a sad site to see. Now on to the sadness of July 30th, 2002.<BR>On the night of July 29th, I was dreaming in my sleep of getting this album first thing tomorrow. I picked up the album at about 5 PM the next day. I listened to the CD a few times. Hey, I will give them credit on diversification and high production value. But the credit ends there. I personally despise rap and hip hop, techno is only bearable to me if it mixes with rock (NIN!). Most of LP's fans, including myself, personally see Linkin Park as a ROCK band. Not a RAP then ROCK band. I could also blame this album on some of the band members's personal tastes, because they picked the people to remix this, or so they say. LP said this record was for the fans. Which fans are they talking about? The second wave of fans they mentioned earlier. The true fans of this band know this was a mistake and should be corrected.<BR>I am awaiting this band's new release next March. From what the band says, it's nothing like Reanimation. That is a sigh of relief for myself. Tokeep yourself occupied, I suggest you listen to Tool, NIN, Nirvana, and Smashing Pumpkins. All great bands that will never disappoint you.
B00003OO3O|5.0|FORCE IT is a great UFO album. The opening one-two punch, \\"Let It Roll\\" and \\"Shoot Shoot\\", really rocks hard, but the centerpiece of the album is \\"Too Much Of Nothing\\", which describes a person trying to keep well in a world as disordered as any. There are other great tracks here as well, and any serious fan of rock music should get this one if they can. Now, if only Chrysalis would reissue this one domestically.
0684874350|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a beautifully tragic book. Frank McCourt's style of writing is unique and fresh. His ability to remember such detail from his childhood gives the book added depth and emotion. The hardships and sufferings he endured as a child humble the reader. Just from reading his remarkable story, I have come to realize how fortunate I am. The book serves as a wake-up call for those who take simple luxeries, like clean bathrooms and electricity, for granted. This book deserves the Pulitzer Prize and whatever awards that are avaliable. My praise to Frank McCourt for this classic.
0060920432|4.0|Personally revealing to me. Opened my eyes to why I enjoyed some things that I did not think I would and pointed me in the direction of setting myself up to enjoy more.
6303020089|5.0|you must see this movie its excellent see this movie. It's one of the best movies I've seen. It has a very good cast including Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones as main chracters. Its must action and Harrison Ford/Tommy Lee Jones fans or fans of the original series.  Buy this movie you won't be disappointed.

B000000W5F|5.0|this has been my favorite 80's Stones record to date.  It has all the essentials for that classic Jagger mouth/lip action.
0790734850|5.0|LA Confidential is an utterly engrossing look into the seamy side of the 1940's \\"City of Dreams\\".  All the actors are brilliant, especially Crowe, Pearce, Spacey, and Basinger in the lead roles.  And James Cromwell is just dynamite as Captain Dudley Smith.  But the real star of this film is the fantastic screenplay, as well as the great cinematography and direction. Curtis Hanson and crew have created a modern masterpiece.  Any fan of film noir, detective movies, or just great filmmaking should see LA Confidential immediately.
B00006V9A0|2.0|I guess you can't really criticize this release too much, for it is practically impossible to make a Nirvana greatest hits compilation that would satisfy everyone.  Because for a Nirvana fan almost every song would seem to have a potential to be on Greatest Hits.  Besides, Nirvana did not release too many albums altogether, so if you are a new fan in my opinion it's better to just go and get their albums, and if you are an old fan then you already have all those songs, except &quot;You know you're right&quot;.  That song is OK; I wouldn't say it is one of the 'greatest hits', and I would just suggest downloading it instead of buying the whole disk and contributing to record companies' undeserved unspeakable wealth.<BR>Of course, the great thing would be a (preferably two disk) compilation of rarities, bootlegs, live versions, etc etc.  But the record companies would never release such thing, wouldn't they...
0425173755|4.0|It was a pretty good book because it kept me wanting to read it.
B000059XUI|5.0|THIS HAS TO BE \\"THE\\" BEST INSTALMENT OF THE SUPERMAN SERIES.<br />ALTHOUGH THE FIRST FILM WAS GOOD, IT DOES NOT HAVE THE FUN CHARACTERS OF GENERAL ZOD, URSA AND NON AS THE KRYPTONIAN BADDIES.<br />I FEEL IT IS THESE CHARACTERS THAT MAKE THE MOVIE ALONG WITH THE PERFECTLY CAST MARGOT KIDDER AS LOIS LANE.<br />STARTING WITH LOIS BEING STUCK UP THE EIFFEL TOWER AND PLUMMETING DOWNWARDS ON A LIFT, ONLY TO BE SAVED BY THE MAN HIMSELF.........SUPERMAN IN HIS TIGHTS!!!<br />BUT POOR SUPERMAN AT THE SAME TIME RELEASES HIS ARCH ENEMY GENERAL ZOD FROM THE PHANTOM ZONE ONLY FOR ALL HELL TO BREAK LOOSE.<br />ONE OF THE SCENES THAT MAKES THE FILM IS WHEN OUR BADDIES ARE IN SPACE AND CONFRONT NASA SPACEMEN.  THE FILMSET LOOKS FALSE AND CHEESY AND THEN THE OH SO POWERFUL ZOD APPEARS WITH HIS MOTLEY CREW ONLY TO CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS.<br />THEY RIP A SPACMEN TO SHREDS AND WATCH HIM CRUMPLE UP, SNAP THE AIR SUPPLY OF ANOTHER AS HE FLOATS INTO OUTERSPACE AND CRUSH THE SPACECRAFT OF THEIR FINAL VICTIM ALONG WITH THE SPACEMAN.<br />MUCH ACTION FOLLOWS, BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT, YOU'LL NEED TO BUY IT!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is very good.  I agree with one columnist who said: &quot;Unlike Timberlake, Christina grasps the spirit instead of copying the style of the best of the King of Pop&quot;<BR>With that said, this album is very different from her debut album. &quot;A Voice Within&quot; resembles her old work the most and it's very good too.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is kinda what i call good ol classic rock.The guartarist is just great and everyone in the band does a great job. I myself has to say that i really like Rage Againest The Machine alot more (As you all know Rage Againest The Machine Broke a pretty long time ago and the lead singer quit and the rest of the band found a new singer and started the band &quot;AudioSlave.&quot;)that was just a history leson for those who dont thoe this bands history. Anyway I think Rage Againest The Machine was alot more active and insane. I think you should first buy a Rage Againest The Machine like the album The Battle of Las Angelous. This is my opinion of it so this is why im giving it a fresh rating.
B000002J6F|5.0|I bought this album on Vinyl when it first came out.  I was a huge C,S,N &amp; Y fan and gobbled up everything they were on.  Some great (Crosby's solo effort &amp; Young's After the Goldrush &amp; Everybody Knows This is Nowhere) to fair (Nash's solo work and the second Stills album).  This album totally blew me away.  The depth of the music and the quality of the musicianship was incledible and inspired.  Unfortunately, the advent of the CD age caused me to totally for get about this album.<br />Imagine my surprise &amp; elation when this CD was finally released on CD.  It is great to here so much great music again.  I truly believe the journey Stills takes here needs to be listened in its entirety and in order.  It all comes together and tells a story about a group of musicians' quest to make a statement about the wonders of the many musical genre's heard hear.<br />I love so many of these songs and agree with most of the reviewers in that this is truly one of the great musical treasures of all time!
0061040967|5.0|This is a wonderful book full of amazing illustrations. Leonardo da Quirm's sketches are amazingly detailed and the characters appeared just as I imagined them to be. Any one who has read 'The Pratchett Portfolio', also illustrated by Kidby, will be delighted to _see_ the charaters in action.<br />The story, while shorter then most of Pratchett's novels, is still highly enjoyable. I love it when characters from different novels have a chance to meet with each other, and the interactions between Rincewind, Captain Carrot, Leonard and Cohen are great.<br />A must have for every Pratchett fan :)
B00005OAIE|3.0|I know that since 75% of the people who will buy this CD are melodramatic teenage girls, and that calling a CD boring may be unheard of to them--but even his first hit single was quickly played-out, and the rest of this CD is no exception. He has quite an original sound, for at least music of late, and his voice isn't too bad; it's just that the songs are redundant, all sounding pretty much the same. I know we all wish Mayer would make more listenable music with his style, but this CD could have been a lot better, it comes off reminding me of Eagle Eye Cherry. He had one of the most played out songs of '98 and is probably one of the biggest one-hit-wonders of the past 5 years, what did the poor souls who bought his CD expect but bland filler--same goes with Mayer. Skip this CD, if you're in to this type of music check out David Gray and British artists such as him, they all have a pretty similar bland boring sound, you'll be blown away.
B00007E8V4|5.0|If you just love Heavy Metal like Disturbed and other bands this is a great album for you.The First Song i heard (F**k The System) Was 1 of my favorite songs right of the bat! The guitarist the drumer... every one in the band just is fantastic in that song!Streamline is also awsume! Its ok if you dont like spenden money on cds when you have a computer to download songs but me myself is a collecter and i just like showen to my friends how many cds i have! I really think System Of A Down has done just a faboulous job on this cd. I think you probably will to.
0786868694|4.0|Another wonderful book from Nigella. A very good read. I just wish she had included all the recipes from her series &quot;Nigella Bites&quot;.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins investigates several companies that have gone from being mediocre to excellent. He finds that they have been able to create a set of characteristics, including the following, which enabled them to go from good to great.<br />Level 5 Leadership - Level 5 Leaders are driven, humble, modest and more concerned about the prosperity of the company than their individual success.  They resolve to do whatever it takes to make the company great, no matter how hard the decisions are.<BR>First Who...Then What - Using a bus analogy, Collins claims that great companies first get great people on the bus, then decide where to drive it. According to Collins, the right people<BR>are your most important asset.<BR>Confront the Brutal Facts - but don't lose faith. These companies believe that they will prevail in the end, but also have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of their current situation.<BR>The Hedgehog Concept - Good-to-Great companies do what they can do best (not what they want to do best), what they are deeply passionate about, and they focus on what drives their economic engine.<BR>A Culture of Discipline -Discipline means that there is little or no need for hierarchy, bureaucracy, or excessive control.<BR>Technology -Technology has little to do with the transformation from good to great. It may help accelerate it but is not the cause of it.<br />For a detailed summary visit my site via my 'more about me' section.

B00005OM4N|5.0|Hey there...I just wanna let you all know that this CD is my fave from all of her 3 Albums...WHY?Well it shows how Britney has grown-up from a girl to a woman...its fantastic...the songs are totally different from her last to albums which are more \\"POP-ish\\" but this one has mixture of pop and r'n'b..!My fave single is \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" even though many people hate I like its sexy tune...\\"Overprotected\\" very grown up and real life song...\\"I'm Not a Girl,Not Yet a Woman\\" I dont like the tune but it shows Britney vocal abilities,\\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\" fantastic wonderful real ROCK N ROLL! and lately \\"Boys\\" I love the tune and beat...I really like the remix featuring Pharrel Williams from NERD...its really great cuz both boys and girls can sing it...so if you're not a Britney fan then I advise you to buy it..and if you are then you have to add it to your collection.I really feel that Britney should release a CD containg all the remixes of her \\"Live In Las Vegas\\" songs and a \\"Best Of\\" CD....well thats what I think anyway...
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a must buy CD.  It is Christina at her best.  She tells all...her real self shines through.  There is something for everyone in the diversity of her songs....Fast, slow, latin sound, funk, hip hop....... This is the best CD I own now and I play it daily. I never liked her until I heard this CD.  She will go far.  This CD should be a number one best seller in a few months...she will rise past Madonna &amp; Janet Jackson...watch!
B00005K9LN|1.0|Columbia is not too great about remastering. The sound is not improved to any degree. The running order is altered and the album dosent sound right with the current running order. The original discs are superior. They have sound that is just as good, and who really cares about bonus tracks? I know this review will be torn to shreds by Priest fans, but keep in mind, I am a huge Priest fan. If I was not, I wouldn't have written a review. I would seek out the first edition discs. Remastering rarely improves sound from cd. Cd is already as good as it gets. Remasters are just ways for record companies to revive slagging sales on artists back catalogs.
B000066NW0|5.0|Like everyone else out there, I also thought that this CD would [stink] completely. I was very wrong. This girls voice is unlike anyone out ther. She is also a very talented songwriter. I already had fallen in love with the song, \\"Complicated\\" but then when I heard the title \\"Sk8er Boi\\" I was like, \\"I'm never going to hear that, what a dumb song\\" at least I thought. Then I heard the rest of the CD and fell in love all over again. What a completely great CD. One of the best out on the market. If you want to buy a great Cd with good vocal stylings, this is the perfect CD to buy.
B00006690G|5.0|This is definitely my favorite album by Eminem so far.  He gives his fans a glimpse into the mind of a superstar, and it's more than a little disturbing.  (Hey, what do you expect?)  The whole album reflects a much more human side of Em, and he gained some respect from me.  Musically, and lyrically, it is the best album of the year.
B00005V1WO|4.0|Sometimes what is real is much more disturbing than what is make - believe.  This movie is a good illustration of this point.  Viewing \\"Gothic\\" with no foreknowledge of the history and background of the story is like watching a blood fetish porno with a plot.  What makes it a great movie though is that, although it seems too fantastical to be real, there is little make - believe.  The night when the Shelleys, Byron, his physician and his mistress (a relation of M. Shelley I believe) got together was more than just a gathering of writers.  It was a laudanum soaked Carnival.  Although a great amount of the story is melodramatic and fictional - especially toward the end - many more elements of the plot are real or are based on actual accounts of the writers' character.  Byron's aversion to blood and his fetish for the women in his wife's death mask for example are rumored to be true, so is Polidori's extreme Catholic persuasion, Shelley's hysterical laudanum fits, and Byron's skull.  Watch the movie, read in detail what happened that night, study the characteristics of each writer, than watch the movie again.  I guarantee a lot of the things which originally seemed ridiculous and out of place will be horrific and make for a great thriller when you realize they are not just bad screenwriting.  When you realize that some of the characters are acting strange and almost inappropriately (such as Percy's ever wide eyed look) it also helps to remember too that these people were all on a handful of different drug combinations including opium, liquor, and probably hash  so they are naturally not going to be acting normal, per se.  As a viewer you are also meant to see the events in this film as an onlooker to the party which includes watching them hallucinate and at times be drawn into their hallucinations (it should be noted though that some thing which appear like poor acting probably are).
B00005QZ7U|5.0|it has never been easier to know in advance if you will like a movie or not. stay away from the &quot;moulin rouge&quot; if you<BR>a. get seasick or easily suffer from motion sickness<BR>b. are uncomfortable with bright colours<BR>c. are uncomfortable with musicals (mind you, so am I generally)<BR>d. detest grand gestures and poses<BR>e. are bored by melodrama<BR>f. are not willing to unabashedly indulge in a feast for all senses<br />for those who are left now, you are in for a ride that will grasp you. this movie consists of so many things that usually don't work for me, but it is an unbelievable achievement of all involved in the making of this jewel, that it really works.<BR>the singing, the use of (countless) contemporary songs in a period setting, the flashback technique, and the mixing of comedy with melodrama.<BR>has any movie ever made you so aware of the fact that anything you'll ever see, you have seen or heard before? hardly anything about &quot;moulin rouge&quot; is new. it's actually the conscious use of this device that makes the movie so unlike anything before.<BR>postmodernism has never been so captivating.<br />i watched this movie for the first time, 4 days before my boyfriend broke up with me. today, with his voice still ringing in my ears, i have watched it again. what can i say? i firmly believe that healing can only start once your wounds are wide open and bleeding. medicine it was, in the most gripping way. anyone who has ever been in love will appreciate the sheer sentiment of the movie. today, i know what i've lost. the movie tells me that i shall not stop seeking it again. a fool who believes that there is reason where there is no heart.
B000005HN6|5.0|Each time I go back to listen to the album, I never listen to the vocals or the Lyrics. The music sets the mood and does the talking. Overall, my favorites are \\"Silhouette\\", \\"Forest Of October\\", and \\"The Apostle In Triumph\\". Definently needs to be apart of your Opeth collection if you don't have it already!
0140177396|4.0|I HATED The Grapes of Wrath, so I thought that Of Mice and Men would just be another boring, overdescriptive Steinbeck book, but it wasn't!  The plot was intruiging and the characters really drew me in and it wasn't over descriptive to the point of annoyance the The Grapes of Wrath.  I thought that I hated John Steinbeck's writing style, but I guess it's just the style he used for The Grapes of Wrath because Of Mice and Men is not at all the same.  It is 100 times better!!!!
6305095566|5.0|Evil Dead is the best series of Horror movies ever. Not one other movie has scared me as bad as the first Evil Dead. Sam Raimi (director) really knew how to lay down the blood and gore, and also puts in some very wierd camera angles that put more scare factor into it. Best in the series.
6303461484|5.0|&quot;Citizen X&quot; is a fascinating, disturbing, riveting film with stunning performances by Stephen Rea -- a brilliant actor -- and Jeffrey DeMunn, a marvelous character actor. I read the book and have to say that the film is better, although it does deviate from the story rather markedly.<br />Rea plays a Soviet forensic investigator who gets put in charge of the hunt for the most prolific serial killer in Russian history. A dedicated man, he is continually frustrated in his effort to find the murderer by Soviet red tape (literally?). Working by instinct because his resources are limited, he doggedly pursues DeMunn's killer. After nearly ten years, Rea triumphs, but at a heavy cost.<br />I can't praise Rea enough for his performance. He may very well be the best actor working today. His investigator takes us into the frustrating world of the little man struggling against great odds, and through his deep brown eyes and everyman's face we feel all of the emotions his investigator feels. By the end of the film, when he finally triumphs, I was crying.<br />DeMunn is utterly fascinating as the killer, a man neglected by the world and out to make it pay. You know this guy: he's the quiet, staring man on the train, the one that gives you chills and makes you stare at your newspaper so you can't see his eyes. Yet DeMunn somehow manages to convey a sense of pity at the way he had been tormented throughout his life. Not many actors could make so repellent a character that compelling.<br />My only complaint is Sutherland's perofrmance. It just didn't work for me. But his character plays so well with Rea that I didn't really care. <br />Get this movie! You'll hate yourself if you don't.
B00005AR3G|5.0|One of the best movies i have ever seen! I lauged until my sides hurt. It's a great disney movie but is great for everyone. Its one of the only movies i will never ever get sick of! if you like funny, buy this baby!!

078062999X|5.0|OKay so here is the story about Hamlet by Kenneth Branagh.  #1 you get the whole text of Hamlet in the movie.  This is a better version than any other Hamlet I have seen.  It is amazing.  The movie is beautiful and it brings the play to life. #2 Kenneth Branagh understands Shakespeare making his verison phenominal.  It is amazing.  I think that you will enjoy this version.
0688101364|5.0|My roommate owned this book, but is not much of a cook herself so she gave it to me. I have made at least half of the recipes and they have all been fantastic! Also, I rarely make anything from a recipe without a picture, and this book has multiple beautiful photos of EVERY COOKIE, so you always know what your getting. Due to many moves, in addition to the one my roommate gave me, I have re-bought this book twice, and I absoultely do not regret it. It is a staple in my collection!
B00005JKBC|4.0|This is a well written, well acted, very well filmed movie that we have enjoyed multiple times.  The extras are well done and enjoyable.<br />There are two aspects to this movie that add particular value.<br />1. Having the main thread of the movie told at the CIA offices permits very quick visual and texture changes when the scene switches as Redford's character reminiscences about the action he's been involved in.  This definitely helps with the pacing.<br />2. The fact that Redford's character anticipates his opponents' actions and plans for them.  One of my favorite lines - 'When did Noah build the Ark? - BEFORE the rain, before the rain'.<br />Enjoy!!
B00007E8V4|4.0|The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 is because of the fact that it just doesn't meet the same standard that Toxicity set.  Granted, I love every song on Toxicity, but every song on this album is at least decent, with a lot of excellent ones, as in better than ones that are on Toxicity:  InnerVision, A.D.D., Mr. Jack (If you think Spiders is awesome, listen to this), I-E-A-I-A-I-O, Highway Songs, Ego Brain, and Roulette (Was anyone else amazed with Daron's acoustic skills?)
0792837614|5.0|Give me a break--this is cinema--not DOCUMENTARY. Those viewers who feel that the dancing made this seem unreal obviously have trouble with fiction.  Hello . . .there is no YODA, either.  This calls for suspension of belief.  It is an artistic reinventing of the Shakespeare tale.  Do the lovers fall in love too quick?  Yes . . . would you rather the film take a realistic 3-6 months for an everday romance to blossom?  I think it is sad that some folk lack the imagination to be able to understand literary devices.  Please, dont go to the ballet--most people dont dress up as swans and swans don't dance anyway . . .
0525946284|1.0|This is the exactly the kind of thing I watch out for with very successful writers.  He either got lazy or he let someone else do most of the writing.  I can't understand how the others could have reviewed this so highly; the premise is good but the writing is awful. I don't demand that a book be realistic, but it has to feel real to bring a reader in; this one does not come close. Ken Follett has written some incredible books.  This is not one of them.
B00006V9A0|3.0|I am a huge fan of Nirvana,and when I heard that they were going to release a best-of album,I got psyched.I didn`t care if &quot;You Know Your Right&quot; was the only new song,i was going to buy it.Well that was a mistake.I own all of Nirvana`s released material,so I wasn`t impressed to hear songs that have been played on the air over and over again.&quot;You Know Your Right&quot; is a great song,but imagine if all of their previously unreleased material was on this album.This album could have been great,but now its just a starter album for people who have never listened to Nirvna`s music.Too bad for this band,because if they were around longer,they had the possibility of being the best band ever.
0316666343|5.0|I am 15 years old and when i look for a book, i like to read somthing funny like Bridget Jones and such, and thoes books have very bright covers, thats what caught my attention! Anyways! this book was incredible. Some pages you would hold you breath just waiting for the next page. It was perfect from beging to end. It had the right balance of drama and a few laughs in the book. It ended beautifuly and the only thing i can complain about is the fact that there cannot be a sequel :( <br />- another note....the writing style of the author was so original! ive never read anything like it....<br />i recomened it to  EVERYONE, even males can appeciate this book.
B00001MXXH|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of my most favorite comedies ever for 2 reasons. One, it became a text book teacher for all of us once we got to our senior year and it also taught us that when you skip school, MAKE IT COUNT! The other reason was that it was just plain funny. Broderick (who normally isn't all that funny) was really funny in this. Of course he had some help from Alan Ruck but still, the movie made you laugh.<br />Like most comedies from the 80's, you have to take it as it is. Ferris Bueller is about a kid who skips school, runs around downtown Chicago on a day of fun, museums, hot tubs, fancy restaurants, prank calls and when you're in Chicago, a Cubs game at Wrigley Field is always nice.<br />I'd recommend this one to all comedy lovers, a definite buy. Also, if you're into 80's comedies check out FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. That movie will seriously crack you up.
B0000028RR|5.0|No other band has started off making such an impact from the beginning. Rage is undoubtedly one of the greatest bands ever. To this day, this album is still reguarded as a masterpiece. Not many artists are willing to express their beliefs, and even if one doesn't agree with them, there is no denying the tallent and masterfull work behind &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot;.

6304509154|4.0|Undisputably the best of the \\"Poltergeist\\" trilogy, this original from 1982 manages a good olf-fashioned spook with an intelligent and probing concept of death, namely that it's consciousness on another level. Produced by Steven Spielberg, directing duties went to Toby Hooper, too often not credited despite his earlier success with the TV production of Steven King's \\"Salem's Lot.\\" The film's cast, from Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams and the late Heather O'Rourke, along with the late Dominique Dunn (daughter of the famed \\"Vanity Fair\\" writer and crime show host), are magnificent in projecting the terror they live in trying to rescue their youngest member, snatched away by the evil force of the \\"other world.\\" Do yourself a favor: to appreciate the full impact of the film, if you haven't already, don't bother seeing the two sequels. They go from silly to sillier and serve only to diminish the impact of the original.
B00006WUWQ|3.0|These are not very good movies.  The first is funny, but Mike Myers falls into his own trap of repeating the same gag multiple times.  He did it in Wayne's World 2, and he did it in both Austin Powers sequels.  He even makes fun of himself my threatening us with them.<br />Although there are mixed feelings about these movies, I'd say that if you do like them, get all of three.  I admit, each does have their moments, but if you were to only get one, get the orginal one.
B00005T7HG|4.0|Critics have maybe unkindly lambasted Madonna in her few film roles since this one, but \\"Evita\\" easily remains her best screen performance. Adapted from famed Broadway producer Andrew Lloyd Weber's long-running stage play about Evita Peron, the charismatic late first lady of Argentina, the movie treatment attracted much casting speculation and critics wrote with some wariness at the decision to cast Madonna. But she portrays the enigmatic Evita with a magnatism that projects from the screen, and Madonna shines in conveying the emotional distance that the real-life lady apparently projected. Madonna handily earned the Golden Globe best actress award she won but was passed over, perhaps unfairly, at Oscar time. As compelling as Madonna is, though, she is nearly upstaged by Antonia Banderas in a surprisingly masterful singing role. As the narrator commenting on behalf of Argentina's devastated working class in the early 1950's, Banderas is simply astonishing. You don't have to be a Madonna or Banderas fan to appreciate this film their vocal interpretations of the songs in it, highlighted by the stirringly emotional Oscar-winner, \\"You Must Love Me.\\"  Visually stunning, the film's leads also pack a tremendous acting punch, and Madonna especially manages to give us a clue as to what made the real Evita tick.
0060930187|4.0|In reading this book I became very depressed.  Esther didn't have any thing good to say about anyone.  Everyone was ugly in some way.  There was always something wrong.  Of course, the shock treatments she had to endure would make anyone negative. What were those people thinking?  The Bell Jar echoes madness from start to finish.  The entire book was difficult to take.  I didn't want to read time after time of Esther trying to end her life.  In fact her life was really just beginning.    <BR>The author Sylvia Plath puts her descriptive writing to great use.  She chronicles Esther's life with great style.  Esther just didn't have such a great life.  Her boy friend, Buddy, was nothing but a thorn in her side.  I think Esther felt she was above Buddy and rightly so.  It's too bad Esther had to go mad during the time that she did.  If this were to happen now there would be a lot better cures for her to turn to.<BR>I think it's difficult to read a book about going insane.  I guess because it make you question your own sanity.  The pressure that was on Esther was mainly the fact that she was an over achiever.  The author wrote that she studied too much; she didn't really know when to quit.  I think it was a very sad book.  Too read about someone with such an enormous cloud over their head.  Really more like a bell jar over their head.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Room for Squares brings the rare combination of soulful, creative writing together with unprecidented musical ability and talent in the form of John Mayer. You'd be a fool not to buy multiple copies of this album and listen to them everyday.  Recently, John has achieved pop stardom as an MTV favorite, but John's music is anything but the type Carson Daily would introduce on the TRL countdown.  Mayer is an incredibly talented muscian, as i have seen for myself at the Greek Theatre in LA.  John puts on a show like no other artist i have seen and would recommend going to view a live performance anytime...as long as you dont get my seats.
B00006RU5B|5.0|After reading less than stellar reviews for Audioslave from some of the main publications, I went in thinking this CD would do nothing for me.  I am a big Soundgarden and Rage fan, but I thought that these two forces would not mix well (maybe I was influenced by the bad press???).  After listening to the CD many time and reading the lyrics I have come to my own conclusion.  This is one of the better CDs in recent years.  But I am most excited about the potential of this group.  This first CD while great may have just been a feeling out process.  Better stuff may be on the way.  So my advice with this CD is to go in with an open mind.  It's not Rage.  Its not Soundgarden.  Get over it.  It's something different.  Stop the comparisons.
B00005JLF5|5.0|This is just to warn you that if you have not already seen the ENTIRE DS9 series, there are comments below, presumably made made in the heat of enthusiasm, that give away many story-arc twists and developments.  <br />I missed most of DS9 after Season 3, and I unfortunately read things below that I did not know would happen.  Partially ruined it for me.  But it's not too late for you, if you don't want to know!  So -- read them at your own risk!
B00004TA41|5.0|Wow. My uncle is a Coltrane worshipper like myself, and also a jazz drummer, a really smart and wonderful man, but he quits on Coltrane after 1965. We argue about this music from time to time, he refers to it as idiotic or says it doesn't make musical sense, but he's calmed down because he knows how strongly I feel about this music. My ex wife would leave the house every time I put this record on. I confess these points of view just astound me. Here Coltrane breaks through yet again into musical territory that is virgin soil, he was the first here, and really no one has come close since (With all due respect mister Dorward I don't think the Prevost/Parker recordings come close, I love those guys, and I love that recording, but man this music is just too far ahead of anyone else. All the same I agree with you though that people should check those and their other works out too). From this record alone I will say Rashid Ali is the greatest drummer to use a Western drum kit I have ever heard. He doesn't play like a drummer, he plays like a pianist,like Cecil Taylor really, he is concerned with sounds, with novelty, I could listen to a thousand drummers and know him every time, he never really repeats himself, never finds a recurring beat and always sounds new and interesting (it's a shame he never recorded with Derek Bailey or Sonny Sharrock my god what that would have been like!). This record is a duet between Saxophone and drums, how bold is that? Not a sax record with drums keeping the time, but a true duet, with each musician changing, moving, making sounds of beauty, new tones, new rhythm, new space, new moods. Yes, the drums make moods, they even have a sensitive side! My favourite of the pieces is Venus, but I love them all, some of the sounds Coltrane made that are dearest to my heart are on these recordings. God bless John Coltrane and Rashid Ali for this music, it is demanding, intricate, difficult, but it is worth the effort. Back to Prevost, he demands you listen to his \\"metamusic\\" and AMM the same way you would read a book,give it your total attention and focus, not a new idea, but to those who view music as entertainment or a mood enhancer/alteration it is good advice. Listen to this music carefully, clear your mind, hear each event, let it speak to you, move through you, let go of all the preconceptions about music that have been put in your head if you haven't already. It doesn't have to communicate verbally or obviously, it doesn't have to have the structures codified by Europeans five centuries ago or time restraints that date back to the running time of a 45 rpm record. Give this a chance like this, just as an experience, it's not meant for entertainment, but for enlightment. Rashid and Coltrane transcend their egos on this one, it can do it for you too, Coltrane beleived the listener was part of the process. And beleive me, the music of John Coltrane can change your life forever. Even if you don't get it at first the effort alone will do so much for your soul and your life. This is one of the key works of Coltranes, and is essential to any record collection, for it is an essential piece of the music of humanity.
B00006LPEY|1.0|I saw Akira for the first time in 1994 and really liked it. It was not available for a long time and when I found out it was going to be released on DVD, I got exciteded. I bought it the day it came out and I was very dissapointed with the new dub. My opinion is that the original was much cooler. The new dub trys to hard to be politically correct. Listen to the way they say Akira. God, I wanna kick in my speakers. Also listen to the stupid accents on the girlfriends voices. They sound cliche or like some fantasy. Quiet, passive, stupid, etc. In the original, they sounded like they were from Brooklyn and it worked really well for the english language. The music, which is really cool and a major part of the film, is my final complaint because it is so faint compared to the original. The voices were mixed to high and you have to keep a close ear open for alot of the memorable and haunting scores. <BR>    Anyway I was lucky to find a copy of the original video in a pawn shop recently and I enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. I didn't watch more than 30 minutes of the disc and I promise I would have accepted a new dub if it'd been done to any acceptable degree. I really think the original english dub done by Streamline Pictures inc. was done that much better and i'm not just saying that to be bitchy. Maybe pioneer should stick to DJ mixers and home audio. <BR>    The picture on the DVD was, well as good as you expect. To bad there's already a D VHS with six times the picture quality of current DVD and an HD DVD is on the way so I hope enough people will complain and maybe Pioneer will include the original soundtrack on one of those formats in the future. As for any review of the story. Find an old one on e-bay. I really believe the soundtrack makes that much difference. This story is not coherent to any passive viewers. They said the new soundtrack was supposed to make the story more clear. Maybe for your mom, but not for me. You must really embrace Akiraor it will completely bewilder you and you might want to stick too MIBII or National Lampoons Van Wilder if you can't identify with this genre of film or you don't have the time. I think It's one of the few Japanames that doesn't rip off themes from Blade Runner, and other great SciFi classic films. It was made long before the shelves were abundent with a mass market of japanese cartoons produced for the cartoon network watching audience.
B0000047CX|5.0|Buy it. You will love it. I've played it for juvenile delinquents who even got off on it. It's that good. Gilberto is the greatest guitar player alive (and I am a respected expert in the field), his playing is like an organ and a harp and a drum and a dancer all at once, the inventor of Bossa Nova who could even sing like no other. And of course Jobim, the greatest songwriter EVER, playing piano on his own tracks, the great Astrud Gilberto and Stan getz, who I've never liked but even he can't ruin this.It lives up to the Desert Island music hype, just like A love supreme and the Coltrane/Hartman record. The record that started it all, the greatest pop record of all time (it outcharted the beatles and knocked them from the number one spot at the time).
0440237688|4.0|I thought this was an excellent book because the author, Lois Lowry, made the statements come alive.

B000003N7K|5.0|Johnny Hartman could sing! What an understatement. He and Coltrane make such a great pair, oh god why couldn't there be more? Please let there be another lost tape waiting for Ravi or Alice to show up with of these two making the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard! The definitive record for \\"setting the mood\\" I've never met anyone who I played this for who wasn't astonished at it's delicacy and beauty. No one can live without this after hearing it, \\"They say it's wonderful\\" as recorded here is the most amazing love song I have ever heard. Flawless, blows even the mighty Ballads and the Ellington collaboration Coltrane did at the time out of the water, even if you don't think you like jazz ballads you will like this record. I personally gurantee it, there should be a money back satisfaction gurantee on this c.d., Amazon wouldn't be at any risk because no one on earth in their right mind would ever dislike this record. It is dangerous though, it will make you want to fall in love with everything around you, it is cupids arrow, and could be used as a tool for seduction by the less principled. I listened to it probably half a dozen times before I even noticed what Hartman was saying, I was just lost in his voice. I fell in love with and too this record.

B00006LIRI|4.0|Just like U2's &quot;The Best of 1980-1990&quot; was missing crucial tracks such as Gloria, I Fall Down, Seconds, Two Hearts Beat As One, and In God's Country; &quot;The Best of 1990-2000&quot; is also missing a few tracks that would have made this compilation a five star release instead of only four. Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, Elevation, and Walk On are wrongfully deleted here. These were all huge hits that should have been included. Other deleted mini-hits include Zooropa, Lemon, If God Will Send His Angels, Last Night on Earth, Please, and The Fly (which apparently is on the UK release). But perhaps worse than the deletion of several key tracks is the re-mixing/mastering of several included tracks. If people want re-mixes of the hits they would have bought the CD singles to get all the b-side re-mixes. The point of a &quot;Best of&quot; album is to give the masses all the hits (as they heard them played on the radio), so people don't have to buy all the singles or albums to get all the hits. These re-mixes were never played on the radio, so therefore they're not hits and shouldn't be on the so-called &quot;Best Of&quot; album in place of the originals that WERE played on the radio. No doubt this was done so that the record company can release another version of a &quot;best of&quot; album later on and make even more money on the same rehashed songs. This release should have been a two-disc album so that ALL the hits could have been included in their ORIGINAL format. THEN, it would have been a five star release. As it stands, there are still tons of great songs here, so even though the song selection merits only three stars, the quality of the songs forces me to give it four stars. But it could have been so much more.
B000002NJS|4.0|Usually I am not a big fan of electronic music which relies heavilly on special effects.  However, the tone of Madonna's Ray of Light CD has me very intrigued.  In between all the special effects(which are used quite creatively)there are some well written songs.  The one two punch of the first two songs(Drowned World/Substitue For Love, Swim) are very mesmerizing not only by the Material Girls touching lyrics but by some good singing, intriguing techno beats and surprisingly good guitar passages.  Frozen is a first class ballad with unusual passion comming out of Madonna's voice. The synthesizers just add to the mood.  Other songs like Little Star and Shanti Ashanti add some new age elements which are indeed quite pleasing and a bit unusual in the pop world.  Still other tunes are great to dance to particularly the title track and Candy Perfume Girl.<br />I never imagined that I would like this Madonna recording based upon several one and two star reviews here at Amazon[.com] and several bad commentary at other music sites.  I am pretty neutral towards Madonna and figured that a greatest hits compilation would be best for my collection.  But I figured, why not borrow this disc and open my mind to something out of my usual realm.  Fortunately I kept an open mind and discovered between all the electronics there is really is a lot of substance on this CD.
6305470464|5.0|I loved this movie.  I had to buy it so I can show all of my friends who never heard a word about it.  There is one actor in it who isn't a raving star (some black woman you always see with Randy Quaid's character) and she only has a few lines.  I think they spent so much on the talent, they didn't have enough money left to market it and we all missed out.  The plot is excellent (twists and turns, some that will leave you sobbing, some laughing- all of which easily identified in your own life) and the most amazing thing is, it all works.  Perfectly.  It all fits together and you end the movie just the way you started.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|I tell you these days its not easy finding quality music that is honest and raw yet loaded with enough modern tones to make it appealing to a wide audience.  Lenny Kravitz certainly succedes on all the above accounts and is a passionate vocalists and compelling guitarist as well.  His songs speak from the heart and soul and are so varied. Fly Away, Let Love Rule, Always On The Run, and Are You Gonna Go My Way rock with abandon while It Aint Over Till Its Over is a funky passionate soul piece.  Stand By My Woman is a beautiful ballad which is reminiscent of Sly Stone's work.  The saxaphone solo is just stunning.  Can't Get You Out Of My Mind and Again make good use of the acoustic guitars.<br />I would have liked to see Circus included on here instead of one of the lesser tunes like Black Velveteen.  And I never was crazy about Lenny's cover version of American Woman.  Its OK, but Lenny's phrasing just does not compare to the passion Bert Cummings brought to the original.  Nonetheless, this is a good compilation with better things to come from this rising staras evidenced by his recent release entitled Lenny.
B000066NW0|5.0|What can i say this CD is amazing.  At first I only listened to the songs that are on the radio and really popular.  But eventually I got too lazy to switch songs and I realized THE WHOLE CD IS AWESOME!!  I love some of the songs that aren't playing on the radios yet even more than Complicated and Sk8ter Boi.  This is one of the first CD's that I can listen through the entire thing and not get sick of the songs!  If you are considering buying it BUY IT B/C ITS AWESOME.
B00007E8V4|5.0|man, as a girl who loves SOAD, i knew i had to review it....this CD...is so good. An awesome mix of their heavy rock tilts, and gorgeous/grating vocals. I own Toxicity, which is awesome, and this CD did not disappoint in the slightest...It's very much in the SOAD style, some songs are reminiscent of \\"deer dance\\" (one of my fave tracks on Tox.) and others, and all of them are great....I love all the tracks, but expecially Roulette, Streamline, A.D.D, Mr. Jack, F**k the System, and Ego Brain...Get/Steal this Album, and listen to SOAD!!!
1586210912|5.0|I am 34 years old and someone I was working for/with came to me with some eye opening information. After we discussed these things he recommended this book along with Cashflow Quadrant. By the time he explained what it was all about, I couldn't wait to order them. Now that I have read both, I am researching, reading the books that Mr. Kiyosaki recommends, and have decided to change my back-to-college-plans from going to beauty school to business management/accounting, instead. You will see why once you read these books. These books are for EVERYONE and I urge everyone to at least read Rich Dad, Poor Dad. It will change your whole life for the better. Most of us are guilty of being lazy about learning to handle our money. We think maybe someone else can do it if we ever save up enough to invest in some way. My favorite quote so far is, &quot;If you don't know how to handle your cash flow, you will work for someone who does.&quot;

B00005JLF5|5.0|Before Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated, Vedek Bareil died.<br />Before 9/11 exposed questions about intelligence failures and whether we need to be intervening through 'black ops,' DS9 introduced \\"In The Pale Moonight\\" and Section 31, as well as two memorable intelligence agents: Cardassian former spy Elim Garak and Section 31 Federation agent Luther Sloan (one of my absolute favorites!)<br />Before the crisis in the Catholic Church...there was Ben Sisko, Emissary of the Prophets.<br />Before Dark Angel and Alias...there was Kira Nerys, the ultimate tough cookie.<br />Before our prejudices against Arabs...there was a vision of a non-fanatic, non-terrorist, Dr. Julian Bashir (my other favorite.)<br />Before the war on terror, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and after the great sacrifices of WWII...there was the Dominion War.<br />Before TV degenerated into a slough only brightened by \\"Law and Order\\" and the new Twilight Zone...there was DS9.<br />Kristin Johnson<br />....
1400031346|5.0|&quot;Mma Ramotswe had a detective agency in Africa, at the foot of Kgale Hill. These were its assets: a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone, and an old typewriter.&quot; So begins Alexander McCall Smith's charming novel, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.<br />Precious Ramotswe grew up in Botswana, an African country that has known relative peace compared to its more unlucky neighbors. When her father dies after a hard life as a miner, Precious inherits a decent sum of money left her by him. Mma Ramotswe invests it all in a rather unusual business-a detective agency proudly named &quot;The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency.&quot;<br />Business is brisk for Mma Ramotswe and she gets right down to it with a trusty &quot;detective manual&quot; by her side. In real life, however, it is not simply bookish knowledge that matters. Ramotswe is a special combination of resource, intelligence, and will. She solves her cases with ample common sense and bravery.<br />Smith's novel, set in the Africa of the 90's, is no hard-boiled thriller. Instead most of Ramotswe's cases depict the many foibles of the human character-cheating husbands, insurance scams and even distrustful fathers. The book's language is wonderfully simple and direct. The individual &quot;mysteries&quot; are good stand-alone short stories in their own right.<br />Interspersed amongst them are pictures of a beautiful country, Botswana, and the quiet grace of its people. Mma Ramotswe's everyday interactions with her fellow citizens are captured wonderfully. Ramotswe meets life with smart sensibilities and a wry sense of humor. She is comfortable in her ample frame (a size 22) and proud of her Africa. She &quot;did not want Africa to change. She did not want her people to become like everybody else, soulless, selfish, forgetful of what it means to be an African, or, worse still, ashamed of Africa.&quot;<br />In a crazed rushed world, Mma Ramotswe stands for everything right about a less frenetic paceof life. In her, McCall Smith has created a perfect embodiment of Africa. Mr. Smith, who has enjoyed some schooling in Zimbabwe but is a Scot himself, has done a great job both in portraying Botswana and in creating a beautiful portrait of a strong woman. I enjoyed the trip immensely. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is just the right book for a lazy weekend afternoon. I especially recommend it with a side of Mma Ramotswe's favorite drink, a steaming cup of redbush tea!
B000002A46|5.0|I got this album as a gift for christmas way back in 1994 and never stopped listening to it ever since! It's the ultimate christmas album anyone can wish for! Mariah's voice is amazing and the songs here really showcase her grat talent. Her rendition of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; is mesmerizing, one listen and you're on the floor! Celine Dion's version of the song is downright horrible (well, she should know you do NOT sing a song already sung by Mariah, it just won't work). The standouts on this cd are undoubtedly the songs written/composed by Mariah, &quot;all i want for christmas&quot; and &quot;Miss You Most&quot;. The first an uptemop, fun song that became a huge hit all over the world and the latter an amazing ballad about missing someone especially at christmas time (it's my favorite on the album). <BR>Don't miss the opportunity to enjoy this excellent cd, especially now when it's christmas!
B00006LSM3|5.0|Similar to Laura Nyro's passing who then left us with the incredible \\"Angel in the Dark\\" CD, George Harrison departs and leaves this posthumous gem, \\"Brainwashed.\\"  The CD pulses with energy and joy.  \\"If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there,\\" George sings on the powerful opener.  \\"P2 Vatican Blues\\" is a sweet shuffle where George acknowledges his impending death as a \\"concrete tuxedo.\\"  \\"Pisces Fish\\" is easy to overlook, but is one I've come to really enjoy, particularly because of George's background vocals giving the track a full feel.  \\"Looking for My Life\\" has a full feel with the interesting lyric, \\"I'd only hung around birds & bees; I never knew that things exploded.\\"  \\"Universe at play inside your DNA; You're a billion years old today,\\" George sings on \\"Rising Sun\\" as his classic slide gives such an emotional wallop.  The instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\" is such a magical melody with Marc Mann's tasteful orchestral touches flavoring rather than overpowering the track.  Buy the CD for this!  \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" is a sweet midtempo track with Jeff Lynne's electric guitar weeping a lot like George's.  \\"Run So Far\\" sounds like Dark Horse period George, while \\"Never Get Over You\\" echoes a sentiment many of us feel about Geroge.  \\"Devil & the Deep Blue Sea\\" is a sweet vehicle for George's ukulele.  George's dobro slide gives \\"Rocking Chair Hawaii\\" an exotic Caribbean feel.  The CD concludes with the blockbuster \\"Brainwashed\\" as a laundry list of hypocricies that fades into the loving Krishna chant.  All though I loved them all, I always say George was my favorite Beatle because he was like the soul of the band, not the one you heard most often, but the one who gave depth.  I was on the way to my mother's funeral in November 2001 when I saw the headline about George's passing on the front page of the Richmond Times.  Tears upon tears that day.  Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy comes with the morning.  \\"Brainwashed\\" is that bright morning for those of us still here in the material world.  Thanks, George.  See you later.ng for those of us still here in the material world.  Thanks, George.  See you later.
B00006RU5B|4.0|For anyone who likes either Rage Against the Machine or the former Soundgarden sound, they will ove this new Audioslave CD. Some songs sound quite a bit like Chris Cornell's huge vocal range chiming over vintage Rage melodies, while others are more toned down and reminisent of classic Soundgarden songs. The former Rage rhythm section backs Cornell's vocals wonderfully. Anyone who expects to hear Chris sing over Rage's sound will get exactly what they ask for.
B000001FQI|5.0|I will put it simply: this is by far the best pop album of (at least) the 1980's at all fronts. Many may disagree, many may doubt it, but that's all they can do about it. It's just a fact. TFF is not my no. 1 band (they were at a time), but this one even beats Simple Minds' Street Fighting Years and Michael Jackson's Thriller. A stunning musical achievement. A masterpiece. A must have. Go for it.
0553278223|4.0|I'm a freshman in high school and about a month ago we reciceved Martian Chronicles. A majority of the students say the books boring and some of upper classmen(sophmores,juniores,seniors) say this is the worst book in the freshman level. Actually it's not that bad. I like how they have mini stories in the book even though it gets confusing. It's pretty funny of how in 1999 people can go to Mars, but Bradbury had a good imgination.<BR>  If you are an African-American who gets offended easily by racial slurs. I'm not sure that this would be the book for you, because in a mini story there is a white man who just criticizes and threatens a character,who is black and uses racial slurs.<BR>    Anyway I'll keep this book, it's a book I'll remember for some time.

0060920432|5.0|Very rarely do you see authors go into the level of detail as did Mr.Mihaly! The book is small and is packed. If you intend to read it in a day and get everything what he wants to say, it will be as difficult as spelling his last name:)[One of the 1-star rater called it a \\"rediculous spelling\\". eeee! The spelling of \\"ridiculous\\" is not \\"rediculous\\" buddy]. The only drawback is that it combines a self-help and a textbook into one but nevertheless its good!
B00006LIRI|4.0|I'm not exactly a fan of U2 or their recent music in the past decade but I found this compilation in the used cd bins one day. I was intending to give it to my brother and his wife for Christmas but after listening to the cd, I think I might have to keep it. The band's music from \\"Achtung Baby\\" up to their last studio album isn't as bad as I originally thought. I still don't care for songs like \\"Discotheque\\", \\"Beautiful Day\\", and \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\". Those songs never did anything for me still there are a lot worse songs out there nowadays. The songs I do like are: \\"One\\", \\"Stuck in a Moment That You Can't Get Out of\\", \\"The First Time\\", \\"Miss Sarajevo\\", \\"Electrical Storm\\", and \\"Mysterious Ways\\". I was surprised that \\"Walk On\\" wasn't included on this best of compilation. Although I do enjoy this cd immensely, I am still not convinced that the band lives up to the hype that surrounds them. I know I am going to draw the ire of diehard U2 fans but the greatest rock band they are not, that title goes to KMFDM in my opinion. \\"The Best of 1990-2000\\" is better than I thought and it has dampened my criticism that I have always felt for the band. If anything, this cd is a good compilation for casual U2 listeners.
0743216458|5.0|Band of Brothers is a true story about a bunch of paratroopers in E Company, 506th Regiment, and 101st Airborne. They go from the D-Day to Hitler's Eagle Nest.<BR> I would recommend this book to people, like myself, who like WWII. I read this book, because I liked the movie, I've seen lots of war movies and books, but this book stuck out. It stood out because of the way they banded together to fight and there friendships. They were willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. They had a lot of confidence in their comrades. This company went through a lot of difficult tasks that I wouldn't want to do. Band of Brothers almost tells these men's stories from the beginning of the war all the way to what their jobs were and when some of them died.  The book gave more details than the movie, so I would recommend people to read the book and watch the movie.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a truly unique film.<BR>It has the most strange, funny, wonderful, and outstanding story. Richard Kelly made his directorial debut with this excellent film. The entire mood for this film is completely outstanding. The acting. The music. It all gels together like magic. <BR>Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie. He is living in 1988 with his two sisters and parents in the suburbs of Virginia, when a jet engine throws his whole life into a strange universe...<BR>This movie is unforgettable. <BR>The DVD has excellent features. 20 deleted scenes. Commentary w/Richard Kelly, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Commentary w/Cast and Crew, The book of Time Travel, website images, drawings, the 'Mad World' music video and so much more.
B000002LR6|5.0|WOW!  What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said?  This is one of the VERY FEW albums that I enjoyed from beginning to end.  Every track is as good as it gets?  If you were expecting another 'Twitch' or 'The Land of Rape and Honey', you are in for a big surprise! <br />Even though their early efforts were unique in their own way, they have been slowly turning it up. Since 'The Land of Rape and Honey', Ministry has been adding a crunchy, guitar driven tune or two on their repertoire.  With Psalm 69, they refined their sound and found their niche (so to speak).  Every single song is guitar driven.  All the usual industrial music trademarks (heavily distorted guitars and vocals, strategically placed loops, pummelling drum machines, etc) are here.  It's a very unified and solid effort.  One of my Top 10 albums of all time....EVER.
0790729725|1.0|Firstly to acknowledge this film as the best film in motion picture history and secondly and perhaps more importantly to give this film the credit it deserves with a real DVD! I don't care what anybody says DVD's should not have to be turned over and have to have some special features. I mean this film is amazing, the master of the gangster film genre why can't we see a DVD that celebrates this until that time stick to the VHS its all we have, ...
B00006ALGL|5.0|This is my album of 2002. It proves what a simple thing of beauty can be created by a voice, an acoustic guitar and an aching, heartbreaking melody. \\"Delicate\\" and \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" are absolute bliss.<BR>Damien Rice should become huge, but I almost hope he doesn't - I'd hate to see such a pure and precious talent corrupted by fame. Listen to this and see him live if you can, before intimacy becomes impossible. Treasure him.
B000002AS3|5.0|Where do i start. Well this is the best debut album ever, well ive established in the title but it is true. Seriously Oasis are a great band but having to stand all of their other albums against this masterpiece would frighten anybody. The album far surpases Whats the Story, anybody who says otherwise is wrong and needs to listen to this album again. In writing this review i know already that most people have got this album im on my fourth copy now! The Songs, oh the songs Live Forever, Slide Away, Columbia Bring It On Down - these songs are amazing! While I acknoweldge that this leaves out many of the singles i'm not bothered because this album has it all, they do not make albums like this anymore. Their only album that mounts a serious challenge to their debut is the masterplan which i think sums up the band, arrogant and cocky - but ill let them off! Listen to this album again and again and nothing will ever stand up to it, i know it makes other albums obsolete but i really do not care

B000002L68|5.0|Wow! This is among the best albums I Have. It is simply that good. Every song on this album is a gem and no wonder it became such a big hit. It starts out with Lets Go Crazy a great opening and continues to surprise with such songs as Computer Blue , Darling Nicky, The Beautiful Ones and of course the dance friendly When Doves Cry. Prince and The Revolution outdid themselves and it payed off. This album is a mixture of funk, pop,rock,eaarie sounds, electronic beats and great vocals and lyrics. Its daring, Its Funky and erotic and I enjoy every minute of it. Every time I Listen to the album I feel like im in another place and it feels with a lot of Princes albums. Princes purple rain becomes one of the most exciting and memorable albums in rock and roll history and is definately worth every praise it has gotten.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I have been a Britney fan since her first cd. I really think this is her best it.The songs are ALL great and don't get old like some previos Britney songs. Also the the booklet to the cd has some very [good] shots of Britney.All you people who think Britney is fading you are wrong I mean come on look at Madonna. If you like other Britney stuff you should definatly buy it.
B000001DYD|3.0|Dont get me wrong. I Like this album And I think its good.<BR>the only thing that bothers me is that you cant hear everything <BR>Polly Jean says on the album and sometimes it gets a little <BR>fustrading trying to hear what she says because there are no lyrics with the album and two songs on this album about Man-size annoy me sometimes but overall this is a good effort. The production is somewhat well you can hardly call it that but it gives good space for the melodies and the music which has to be the main keye of the albums aclaim. This contains raw emoitions, great guitar riffs and very interesting version of Bob Dylans track Higway 61 revisited. Overall a good effort that any real music fan should have in their collection.
0393039765|5.0|A MUST READ. What a riveting book, As an avid reader,not many authors can touch me this way. After viewing the movie, I was so affected that I hopped right online to Amazon.com and ordered the book. Chuck Palahniuk has reached into the very depth of all dissaffected,disillusioned inneffectual males who are spinning their wheels trying to stay afloat in this trash laden chemical waste pit we call corporate america.He says its alright to not want IKEA furniture and SUVs and that it's not alright to accept things the way they are. \\"Holden Caufield Grows Up\\" is what Chuck is saying. Fight Club is definitely a grown up version of \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" by J.D. Salinger. If you liked \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" when you were a teenager you will LOVE Fight Club as an adult. If we were to see Holden mature into adulthood we would have witnessed him joining Fight Club. Imagine Holden bloodied and battered standing over another poor bloody pulp he's just beaten down at Fight Club. You cannot change the system but you can always fight...How do we rebel,we have been raised to believe we would all be millionaire rock stars and we truly have no outlet when we discover the hard cold truth. The intensity of modern life today is enough to drive any man to extremes. I thought that Chuck Palahniuk has captured the pent up feelings present in a lot of us these days, the complete rejection of all things politically correct and disgust with the \\"normal\\" corrupt modes of business that we tolerate in his world. Fight Club is Nihilism at its very core. Being an avid  reader of all genres, I devoured each and every word of \\"Fight club\\" Its alway great to find an author that really relates to your view of the world... I wish Chuck Palahniuk a long and successful career.

B000069HK2|5.0|Wow, I cannot say enough about how amazing this band is. Not only is The Used's debut album THE best &quot;screamo&quot;/punk album to come out this year, it is one of the best albums to come out this year, period. The vocals &amp; lyrics are amazing. Bert can scream better than anyone I've heard, but his singing voice is equally as impressive, and he can alternate between the two effortlessly. His words have so much substance and emotion behind them too, which seems especially rare in so much of today's music. Quinn's guitar work is as versatile as Bert's singing, with powerful, driving riffs and beutifully melodic phrases (also a rarity in today's heavier music). A couple of the songs also have orchestral arrangements under the guitars which make the music even more dynamic. The underlying rhythm section with Jeph on bass and Branden on drums is a driving force throughout the entire album as well. Every song is so well crafted, I couldn't pick any in particular as my favorite. There honestly isn't a weak track on here, but I think the highlights are probably &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Noise &amp; Kisses&quot;, and &quot;On My Own&quot;. I could go on forever, but I'll sum it up by saying that the last time I was this impressed by an album was when I first heard &quot;Around the Fur&quot; by the Deftones. (and that came out in 1997!) This album is a masterpiece, and I can't imagine anyone finding it as a disappointment.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Thank God, good music is finally back. This CD is one of the best out there today. Cornell is back and incredible!! If you do not have it, get it already!
B00005RFVL|5.0|I don't know what to say...Well, Robbie Williams has done his share of good albums but to leave the regular popscene to make a Frank Sinartaish jazz album is just brilliant...in his case! This album is so good. All songs are of very high standard, they're not just a bunch of covers...Williams voice was made to sing jazz, he would fit right in with the Rat pack!<BR>The first song, I will talk, hollywood will listen is Williams own composition, a beautiful song! It was a very good year is a duett with the one and only mr. Frank Sinatra. It's really something!The only song I don't like is something stupid, with Nicole Kidman as his co-singer. I guess I don't like the song, but the original version is so much better!<br />All in all this is an album everybody should own who has the slightest interest in Robbie or jazz in common. Too good to miss!
B000069AUI|5.0|I LOVE this CD. I got it for my birthday a week ago, and haven't stopped playing it since. I don't have \\"Parachutes\\", so this was my first Coldplay album, and it is absolutely stunning. Chris Martin's voice- and some of the most beautiful lyrics and melodies you've ever heard- combine to make this record one of those albums that gives you goosebumps every time you listen to it. I too could say why each song is fantastic, but I'll refrain. This is an album where upon the first listen, you love it, and by the second and third times you're hearing it, you've fallen in love. A must-buy.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Like many other listeners, I first experienced Alison Krauss' ethereal voice in \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou.\\"  I promptly purchased the soundtrack, which incidentally still gets frequent playing time in my home.  Honestly, I hadn't intended to purchase Alison Krauss' work until until I caught a clip of this very same LIVE performance on television.  I was so impressed with her musicianship (live shows are good at separating 'studio' artists from the real ones), her poise, the immense talent of her band that I went out and ordered this CD shortly thereafter.  <br />Hands down, it's one of the recordings I've heard EVER.  With 99% of the albums I purchase, there are a select number of songs I like, and the rest is sort of filler material.  There is NO filler on this album.  Alison's simple, expressive, angel-like vocals (but boy can she hollar too, make no bones about that!) are reason enough to buy this album, but there are also very fine performances by her bandmates and one guest artist.  All in all, a perfect package. <br />Take it from one whose musical collection consists of anything BUT bluegrass or country, and whose musical training is centered primarily around opera, you will wonder why you haven't bought anything of Alison Krauss' before and thank your lucky stars for finding her now.<br />If you're still reticent, listen to \\"Maybe\\" on Disc 2.  Have your credit card ready.
B000002LCI|5.0|Continuing the bleakness of where 1986s Black Celebration left off, Music For The Masses is slightly brighter yet much colder than the previous album. The album cover perfectly portrays what the mood of the album is like; the hazy sunset portrays the bleak minor tracks and the bullhorns seem to portray the extremely experimental, and downright sonic bite of the music. <br />NEVER LET ME DOWN AGAIN-Who can ever forget the danceable \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" with it's bizarre instrumentation, metallic beats, buzzy synthesizers, harsh piano licks and stabbing sonics towards the ending. I would say that it's the most schizophrenic tracks on the CD. The loud melody would portray the sunny daytime feel, but the eerieness gives the 'sunny mood' an unpleasant feel like something is not right. As the song climaxes with the orchestral band in the background before gradually fading into a dreamy, hissing steam pipe sound effects which bring us into the dreamy haze of the next track. This is an unforgettable classic from an unforgettable band. <br />THE THINGS YOU SAID-This song is much darker, and more mellow and portrays a very dreamy haze of the monotony of the same old things over & over in adolescence and also the admitting of ones weakness and not keeping secrets. Musically speaking, the music itself perfectly fits the meaning.  I just love it's dark, dreamy, grey, hazy atmosphere. No idea why this wasn't made a single. :/ It's one of my favorites. <br />STRANGELOVE: Who can ever forget this track. Strangelove is one of the most danceable track on the LP. However, where the version played on the radio has the thumping, bass-heavy beat, the version the parent album has a much lighter beat, but it doesn't rob the song of it's power. True, I like the single version with the heavier, but either way, Strangelove is one of my all-time favorite songs from DM. I love that line \\"Will you take the pain, I will give to you, again & again\\". It perfectly fits how I sometimes feel about past lovers. The main song fades out except for a cold, dreamy, ambient outro chord which fades into a much darker minor note ending the track.<br />SACRED: The fourth track, Sacred, begins with the minor note intro that ended Strangelove and has an eerie, choir before it blasts into a bass-heavy danceable track.  Sacred is a much darker, more danceable track that, from my guess, is about religious doubt, although I don't think it's nearly as suicidal as Blasphemous Rumors is. <br />LITTLE 15: Little 15 is probably one of the most experimental tracks on the album. There are few synthesizer-like sounds like on the previous ones. Instead the song has a more, how would I say it, orchestral sound. There are some keyboard dabblings in the middle of the track. <br />BEHIND THE WHEEL: The song begins with the most memorable intro in my opinion with the sound of a rolling lid and then the beating drums come in with aggressive guitars. Ultimately frightening chimes are followed by pulsating beats and a gloomy feel to the music. From my guess, it speaks of not wanting to be in the center of the action at times. <br />I WANT YOU NOW: Whoa! DM at their erotic apex! A heavy breathing of someone breathing through a gas mask before a bizarre, disturbing track comes in about intense sexual longing and urges. This is one of the most experimental tracks on the LP and is almost like it's own genre of music. As the song fades out a Sci-Fi-like speaker voice effect  comes in then a disturbing low-pitched siren comes in. <br />TO HAVE AND TO HOLD: The disturbing siren brings us to what I consider the most frightening song that Depeche Mode has ever done in their career. The siren gives away to alarming buzzes and wailing alarm sound effects with a , lead grey storm atmosphere, and an extremely eerie mood to the song. As the beats stop, the disturbing siren sound keeps wailing until it's immediately cut off at the end of the track. <br />NOTHING: This song is probably the last `regular'track on this CD. It's a nihilistic dance song with a dark dreamy, hazy atmosphere and electronic guitar pulses and phat beats. A great song. After this, the album becomes more experimental until track 14. <br />PIMPF: Pimpf is a bizarre Gothic piano instrumental that feels more like a B-Side to a single and in fact, it was the B-Side to \\"Strangelove\\". The song becomes an explosive, Gothic wash of `Gregorian' chanting, and chinging bells before ending. There is a `hidden track' within it which is a bizarre sounding challiope with the sound of a basketball bouncing. <br />AGENT ORANGE: Could the title of the track be better? This is a very gloomy instrumental and probably the darkest song on the entire album. It begins with a cold, nuclear winter breeze and becomes a death-like ambient instrumental similar to Pimpf but with more oomph to it. <br />NEVER LET ME DOWN (AGGRO MIX): This is a remix of the original single with aNitzer Ebb like flavor to it and a totally different melodic structure before creeps of the original come in. <br />TO HAVE AND TO HOLD(SPANISH TASTER): This is a reworking of track8, but with a less frightening sound and more of an industrial dance vibe to it. <br />PLEASURE, LITTLE TREASURE: The album wraps up with this perky yet gloomy number. With it's ominous melody, pulsating beats, quirky keyboards, and acoustic guitars, I'd say that this continues where Stripped left off but a more danceable sound. I love the `Egyptian' voice effects at the ending. The voice echoes away and wraps up the album. <br />I cannever recommend this album enough. Sure, they had bigger hits and sold after this but from my perspective, Music For The Masses remains their masterpiece to this day. Buy it! It's so worthit!
B00005BL2A|4.0|To anyone who gave this less than 4 stars, you serioulsy need to rethink your music reviewing capabilities.  I am not going to say this album is comparable to Violator(of course not) or to 101 but hell, you tell me what other bands can deliver after 20 years?<br />Depeche Mode is an influential group that is based on pure originality and passion for what they do.  I am not aware of any other groups that after 20 years in the business can still sell out concert venues.  Lets face it, DM is going to be around a long long time even when they aren't around.<br />Anyone hear the new Dirty Vegas single &quot;Days Go By&quot;?  Recognize the beat?  Yep, thats DM.  From a song on this album, &quot;Dream On&quot;.<BR>Your Dirty Vegas, Moby and anyother &quot;electronic&quot; bands couldn't conceive of their existence if it wasn't for DM.
B00007E8V4|3.0|I swear a spelt originality wrong. Anyway! It is not a real album. Me rating this CD would be like rating a burnt mixed CD. But here is my view on it. All the songs connect together very well and flow throughout the CD like a funky unique screamo reggae vocal, jazz core, catchy drum beat journey. But in a way, all the songs connect like they all sound the same. It is filled with old and new System musical styles. All the songs lack length. All of them range around 2 minutes long. Then the longest song is around 4 minutes. I enjoy the CD a lot myself. But it isn't as talented as I would like to believe it to be. Ok. So one last thing I notice is the majority of the songs sound a lot like one or more songs off of both beforehand System of a Down CDs. Here is the list:<br />1. CHiC 'N' STu - Reminds me of that pizza song. &quot;I was a pizza, now I'm a mess&quot; but in a hardcore version. System style!<br />2. iNNERViSiON - Suggestions.<br />3. BuBBLES - Know, Soil.<br />4. BOOM! - Prison Song, X.<br />5. NuGuNS - Forest, Deer Dance.<br />6. A.D.D. - This song sounds too much like Forest. It is really really sad. But the lyrics are really good.<br />7. MR. JACK - X, Aerials.<br />8. i-E-A-i-A-i-O - Metro, Johnny, Aerials, X, Shimmy.<br />9. 36 - This song reminds me off a boot camp. You know the songs they sing. The very first part of the song reminds me of the robot song by one of the local bands here called Absence of Tomfoolery. It doesn't remind me of it actually, both songs sound exactly the same. The beginning part I mean.<br />10. PiCTuRES - Mind, Shimmy.<br />11. HiGHWAY SONG - Spiders, Know.<br />12. F**K THE SYSTEM - Suite-Pee.<br />13. EGO BRAiN - ATWA, Chop Suey.<br />14. THETAWAVES - Science<br />15. ROuLETTE - Amazing song! Very original!<br />16. STREAMLiNE - This song is good. I don't like it that much though. It isn't System like.<BR>~I know no one will agree with me on these but oh well. You may not understand what I am getting at either. :P
B000066NW0|3.0|Several people claim that Avril lacks originality.  It's hard to argue with that, but when you look at the facts it's rather easy to see why she lacks originality.<br />1. Her music is full of teenage angst.  Why?  Because she is a teenager full of angst.  Therefore, her music, which is personal to her, will reflect that angst.  The truth is that most teenagers are full of angst.  So Avril Lavigne is essentially writing from the view points of angst ridden teens.  We all know that's been done over and over, but that doesn't make it fake.  <br />2. Let's face it, how many different ways can you say that you are angry at the world?  Of course, it's been done before, but a lot of teenagers ARE angry at the world.  <br />I think that avril lavigne would have benefited from recording her first album in her early twenties rather than at age 16, but who can blame her for grabbing the opportunity while it was there.  So the end result is still an enjoyable listen to typical angstful teenage music.  <br />I think that over time her songwriting will evolve into something much better than it is today.  She has a lot of life left to be lived.  I believe that she will grow out of this \\"punk\\" stage as most teenagers tend to do, and by that time she may well have developed into a formidable artist.<br />As for this particular album, I personally enjoyed it, although it's not my favorite by far.  If you like Complicated, and Sk8er Boi, or the new single I'm With You, then go on and buy this album.  Chances are you will like what the other songs have to offer.
B00006LI4S|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD to watch when you are alone in a quiet house with a beer.  David's music heals the heart and soul.  I've seen the Floyd live, on and off, since 1975, when I watched rows of chained \\"hippies\\" get whisked off to jail by L.A.'s Chief Ed Davis, at the L.A. sports arena.  I've seen him play in Austria, in an airfield--oh the amazing stories I could tell about that concert.  But anyway, I've always secretly wished Gilmore would play, \\"Fat Old Sun,\\" live and now he finally has.  (I love that song.)  I loved his cover of Syd Barrett's songs as well.  (Wouldn't it be great if Syd sang on David's next DVD?)  There are so many other numbers I'd wish he'd do at such shows in the future.  I hope he does more DVD's like this one.  And Mr. Gilmour--if you ever read this--I hope you do \\"Granchester Meadows,\\" the beginning of \\"The Narrow Way\\" and I hope you do that wonderful, but neglected gem, \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore,\\"  Syd Barrett's \\"Golden Hair,\\"  and more things like \\"Sonnet 18\\" (what an incredible surprise).  Who needs Roger Waters, when you can co write songs with Shakespeare as your lyricist?  A big thankyou again to David Gilmour for this wonderful music.
068817776X|5.0|This book is an extremely well told story of a woman who, in order to survive The Holocaust, ends up marrying a man who ends up as a Nazi Officer.<br />Sorry to be crass, but this book is a real page turner.<br />Edith is an intelligent, warm & witty soul who had an extraordinary experience & luckily for us, has been brave enough to look back & write it all down.<br />It has an intimate quality, due largely to the fact that Ms. Hahn Beer has written it for her daughter who, born in a Nazi hospital, in 1944, wanted to know exactly what happened.

0618164413|5.0|My 3 year old twins (girls) are totally rivited by this book.  Yes, the stories are long (allow 15-20 minutes each), but they enjoy it so much, it is well worth it.  Hands down, this is their favorite book.  <br />As a parent, however, I think this book could use a little updating.  Some references are harmless, like referring to a record player (what's that?!), but others are what we would now consider politically incorrect or stereotypical: \\"fireman\\" instead of \\"firefighter\\", references to a \\"fat man\\", and \\"pretty nurse\\".  A few characters, including George, smoke a pipe!  <BR>All in all, I would not let this stop me from purchasing the book; it's just something to be aware of.
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril...let's see, how to describe her.  My personal opinion of her is not so great ... and it's really painful to go to a social event now and see girls my age wearing ties and Abercrombie shirts.  (True story.)  But this review isn't about her, it's about her music.<br />I actually like this album.  It's not my favorite, but it's okay.  It starts out with \\"Losing Grip\\", which is a slightly rambling, if good, song that gets boring after the first two and a half minutes.  The next is \\"Complicated\\", which I'm sure we've all heard.  Then comes \\"Sk8ter Boi.\\"  And if you think the title is annoying, you should try the lyrics.  However, the tune is pretty catchy and it's a really easy singalong party song (which can pave the way for several parodies you can write).  After this is \\"I'm With You,\\" which is one of the weaker songs in the album. I really dislike this one (it reminds me of Kelly Clarkson).  Next is \\"Mobile\\".  The tune is okay, but it does get old after four or five times.  Then is \\"Unwanted\\", which is the angriest song on the CD and features the stronger side of Avril's voice.  The anticlimax following this song, is \\"Tomorrow\\", which is very slow and very reminiscent of a Michelle or a Vanessa.  (I think Arista decided that we needed a break from Avril's idea of heavy metal.)  Track 8 is \\"Anything but Ordinary\\", which is actually one of my favorites.  Despite the rudimentary vocabulary and the irony of the song if you think about it (Avril Lavigne...singing about being unique...) it's got a pretty good tune and some attempt at deep lyrics.  Next is \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", a very bubblegum-pop, upbeat, and slightly wistful song.  A really cute one.  \\"My World\\" follows.  This song is...weird.  We learn all about Avril's hometown of Napanee and what she thinks about there.  There's really no point to this song, but it's okay.  Then comes \\"Nobody's Fool\\", which is probably the most painful one (\\"Dear God, she's rapping\\" was my first reaction).  Yes, folks, Avrilraps...and she's terrible.  The chorus is decent, but the rapping...*shudder*  The next track, however, makes up for it--\\"Too Much To Ask,\\" my favorite, in which Avril actually makes a connection to deeper issues (the song is about a boyfriend who's on drugs) and also sports a great sound to boot.  Last is \\"Naked\\", which, like \\"Losing Grip\\", is good but repetitive.<br />Bottom line?  Avril's got talent. We may need to unearth it a little more and give her vocabulary/grammar/spelling lessons (maybe she SHOULD have stayed in high school) but the talent's there.  Now if she'd only lose the arm socks and the tie...
B00007E8JP|5.0|As with any S.O.A.D. album, these songs are absolutely wonderful. This CD may not be as *perfect* as Toxicity was, but how they took these songs off the cutting-room floor and re-did them as beautifully as they did is amazing. System has changed their sound in some of the songs (&quot;Ego Brains&quot;, &quot;Roulette&quot;) but it shows how their music is changing and growing for the better.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|NUGGETS was originally a 2-LP set released in 1972, celebrating the sixties phenomenon known as &quot;garage rock&quot;. Further volumes were promised but never emerged, until Rhino in 1998 released this four-disc set. The original NUGGETS is on disc one, with three more volumes of almost-forgotten rock classics as well, for 118 tracks total. For the uninitiated, garage rock was what happened when thousands of American youngsters, inspired by groups like the Beatles and the Stones, took to forming bands and playing - no surprise - in somebody's garage. The music is, by and large, somewhat simplistic, played in a reckless, amateur fashion, with much more emphasis on energy and attitude than on professionalism. And that, of course, is what makes it great. Some of these cuts are psychedelic, some are more bluesy or folk-influenced, some are pure pop, and many of the best tracks are hybrids of these styles. There are too many songs to comment on them all, but I can say that each one has something interesting about it. Some of these were chart hits; many of them weren't. (It's a testament to the oft-confused music industry that the ones that didn't chart are often as good as, or better than, the ones that did). Predominantly, the songs are presented in mono (OK, there are a few in stereo, but who cares). It's a crazy, exciting, enlightening trip, and well worth it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|If you're a big fan of Monty Python, then you're already familiar with their style of humor. If not, this is a perfect place to get acquainted with the boys, as I know many people who know little about MP except for this film, and they all love it!<br />Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on British television from 1969-1973, is an original, funny, TV experience. The latitude that the group was given in terms of creativity is amazing. However, if one digs deeper, he/she learns that sometimes the BBC put the kibosh on some of the gags. In short, the Flying Circus shows were a testimony to the comic brilliance of John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, and my personal favorite, the now deceased Graham Chapman.  The other Python films are all great as well, including The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life. But in the end, I think we all keep coming back to this film as the first and funniest of the Python movies.<br />I'll not try to navigate through the \\"plot\\" as it would be futile.  Instead, I'd like to show what an excellent DVD this is. Not only do we have the film in widescreen (that's a must---don't even try to get me to watch a film in \\"pan and scan\\"!) but there's also some great extras including a 45 minute documentary where Michael Palin and Terry Jones revisit the old locations in Scotland where the film was shot. Who knew that the vast majority of the movie was shot in one old castle built in the early 14th century? Not me. There's also a neat little 17 minute BBC production called \\"Film Night\\" that shows on location interviews with all of the Pythons.  You can also sing-along to all of the musical numbers and there's a Lego version of the \\"Nights of Camelot\\" sequence (It is a silly place). <br />There are a lot of other extras that I'll let you find out about for yourself. Above all, this is the kind of DVD that serious film fanatics and collectors drool over. One that has a great movie in widescreen and a lot of great extras.
B00000I1OY|4.0|I bought this video used for [cheap] on a whim, never having seen it before, reasoning that the pretty blonde on the cover would be worth the price even if the rest of the movie was a dud. Was I ever right to buy it! The story seemed incredibly boring at first, but I persevered, and when the final scene came, it was a slammer! That's when the viewer suddenly realizes that everything that has been viewed up to that point is to be reconsidered in a much different light. That's when I watched it again. And again and again. Each viewing uncovers more hints as to what was really going on, especially Ned's comment that if you believe in something hard enough, then it becomes real to you. Note the significance of the one person's name that Ned forgets, and that the closer he gets to home, the more unfriendly the people seem to become. I wouldn't say the film has become one of my favorites, but it's a good one to pull out every once in a while to experience again. I liked the feel of the film altogether: Ned's creative brainstorm in the beginning, his optimism and contagious enthusiasm, his suave demeanor and initially positive interaction with everyone, the nostalgic sadness about old friends and rediscovering a cart from childhood, the ambience of swimming pools and upper middle class society, and pretty Janet Landgard (the blonde on the cover) running about in a blue two-piece swimsuit. The film does have some weird '60s touches and it gets progressively sad as the story evolves, but it's an unforgettable movie worth seeing at least once, especially in the summer, especially if any of its attributes appeal to you. There are also several important psychological and social issues brought up in the film. I later read Cheever's original short story, and I think the film is an improvement that fills in many gaps and human touches whereas the written story seemed like a brief, sterile synopsis of the film.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This album is great when I'm not in the mood for hard-core, loud stuff.  Nora Jones has a very distinctive voice; not overly showy, but great for this type of music.  This is good music to fall asleep to at night.

0066214122|4.0|I love reading Michael Crichton novels. He seems to be the only author that I can breeze through with little effort and in a reasonable time. The reason for my inability to put his novels down is the suspense and the technological depth. I'm kept on edge while being fed an intriguing thesis. Prey is no different, in fact it uses exactly the same formula as his other hits.<br />If you're looking for an \\"A typical\\" Crichton novel, one that introduces you to a collection of top level geeks, who find a scientific problem, and work as a dysfunctional team to disarm threat after threat, then this book is for you. I know what I am getting when I buy a Michael Crichton novel. Not a literary classic, not an analysis of characters, but a techno thriller.<br />Jack Forman is a house husband, unemployed because of his strict work ethics. His wife, Julia, works for Xymos, a company on the edge of breaking new ground with Nanotechnology. Just as Jack believes that his marriage is on the verge of complete breakdown, with his wife acting like she is having an affair, she has an accident. Jack is then drawn into Xymos as a contractor to oversee his old team that developed his agent based program that is at the heart of the Nanosystems Xymos manufacture. The suspense spirals upward as Jack is drawn into a battle with \\"Nano-Borg\\".<br />Prey reminds me of a mix between Sphere and Jurassic Park, with the threat of a touch of Disclosure thrown in for legal good will. Locked in an isolated fab plant, cut off from the rest of the world, with an engineered threat, while dealing with a family emergency that could end up in the courts. Talk of the latest anti-male threats of \\"Alienation of Effection\\" makes me wonder if there isn't just a little autobiographical material thrown in. I loved both novels, so it made it easy for me to enjoy Prey.<br />With Timeline and Jurassic Park The Lost World I couldn't help but see him setting up scenes for a cinematographer. Prey, on the other hand, didn'tread as much like a movie. I guess it is always in the background, especially when the rights were purchased by Fox before publication (see \\"Fox Snag's Michael Crichton's PREY\\"), and he is well know for his movies. It just didn't distract like the others.<br />As usual Crichton explorers some of sciences latest areas, artificial life and nanotechnology. Jack led a team involved in creating distributed processing, creating computer applications that spread the workload across a number of agents. The field has explored swarm technology, the same processing that a colony of ants or bees use to work together as a team. Combined with nanotechnology the possibilities explode. As do the potential problems. Science is truly on the verge of all these possibilities, with Gaak the escaping robot, a robot that learns how to fly, and a circuit that reinvents radio, all recent scientific creations. For anyone with a passing interest in the future, Prey is fascinating reading.<br />Prey certainly seems to be the pinnacle of Crichton's mountain of suspense. He builds layers as any breakout novel should. Don't pick it up expecting literary or character depth, but as an easy to read suspense filled novel it is hard to put down. If you've enjoyed Crichton's novels or movies, then Prey will be an enjoyable read. As a primer, it is worth reading Bill Joy's paper in Wired Magazine, \\"Why the future doesn't need us\\". Combine them both and it becomes evident that we have to be very careful with what we do with science. We may have learnt much in the past few decades, but we don't know near enough.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Words cannot describe this album.  I have looked through all the negative reviews of it and am astonished at the ammount of contradiction that takes place.  People have called this album everything from over-rated too an attempt to \\"emulate Coldplay.\\"  Come on now, this album isn't over-rated.  It was anticipated due to the amazing releases previous.  There are some poor tastes out there, and this album won't appeal to those tastes.<br />In my opinion, the album flows perfectly.  There is a clear theme, and there is subsequent emotion.  Other reviews have said they dont like the album because they don't understand the lyrics.  Well, York's vocals are used maginficently to convey the angst and fear present in this album.  You may actaully have to listen to this album to understand it, and some people just may not want to take the time to do so.<br />Quite honestly, there is not a song on OK Computer I don't like.  The opening song, Airbag, is amazing and pulls you into the start of this broodening, eerie and reflective album.  Another reviewer wrote about the poor lyrics in this song, and well, screw him.  This song is almost a highlite by itself.  Following is the widley appraised song Paranoid Android.  Everyone seems to like this one, so if you haven't heard it, well, this is a place to start.  It's followed by a marvelous tribute to Bob Dylan, with Subterranean Homesick Alien where gentle, rhytmic guitars play somber melody to rather depressing lyrics.  One of my favourites.  I could go on and on about all the other tracks, but that would take up to much space, so let's just right to the major contraversy.<br />There is a lot of complaints about Fitter Happier, but I think it suits the album.  I honestly cannot see this album without this song.  It's not really even a song, but more of a message.  That's what makes this album marvelous.  The artistic integrity involved.  Fitter Happier is not a highlight of course and I doubt even Radiohead themselves could expect you to get as involved in this track, as compared to others.<br />You will not like this album if you like pop music.  You will not like this album if you enjoy heavily commercialized music.  You will not like this album if you don't enjoy interpretive art.  Because that's what this album is.  The entire album is a reflection on life in the 20th Century, and there is emotion in the lyrics.  One of the top albums of the decade, and don't be fooled into thinking otherwise, by poor, tasteless review.  This album has integrity and character, which is says far more in comparison to other \\"five-star\\" albums on amazon.  If you do not have this album, I highly recomend you get it.  This is an album you can go back to again and again, and it only gets better.
B0000039QA|5.0|I am impressed with this rapper flow and music. I really can't understand why he was taken so early in his life when could of been alive recording more album like this and his debut album Ready To Die which is a classic album just like this one. Sky's The Limit is a persong and so is Kick In The Door.

B0000039PW|5.0|this is a great classic debut album from the Illest rapper in his lifetime and ours. I love this album because it's a universal message from the rapper telling how it is thru his stories and tales of the wrold which turned on him. Juicy is the best track ever, he loves hip hop and so do I because of Biggie Smalls
B00006RU5B|3.0|I was disappointed with this album. While it is hands above most anything else released in rock recently, that doesnt necessarily mean much, considering the junk thats being put out anymore. Chris Cornell has a great voice and it does shine on this album, other than the first song in which he is almost unrecognizable and sounds like Brian Johnson of AC/DC. The problem that I have with this album is once the songs get going they all sound the same. The guitarist from Rage does do some interesting stuff with his guitar, but every chorus to every song he seems to play the same thing or a variation on the same thing. There is a difference between having a distinctive style and doing variations on it over and over. There are some great tracks, particularly the first half of the album, but the rest is just a rehash of things we've already heard. People were very excited about the possibilities of this album and I think because it didnt [dissapoint]its getting alot more credit than it deserves. Hopefully the next album will have a little more variety and I'll be able to differentiate one track from the next
B000059MEK|3.0|I remember when I first got this, I couldn't stop listening to &quot;one more time&quot;.  I just thought it was the best french disco house to come out in a long time.

0151003084|5.0|Throughout the short time it took to read this delightful book, I wondered this: Why am I not disgusted and horrified? Why have I not returned this book, or at last complained about it? Why am I...enjoying it?<BR>    The book seems surprisingly wrong, with twenty-six little children meeting their demise. However, the whole thing is darkly comical, and worth reading. However, many would think that a small book consisting of twenty-six pages of print would be a waste of money, and it would be, if it were not for the eerie, scrichy drawings. The drawings are hauntingly disproportionate, drawn in a stylized manner that will have you marvling at their twisted magnificence. <BR>     Some say that this book is horrible. I love it
B00005JKCH|5.0|What a great film....look, with almost 700 reviews written, there's hardly much I can add, it was just very nicely done and a great family movie I think. I never read Spiderman as a kid but it doesn't matter, I highly enjoyed the movie, well worth a buy!!!<br />I've heard many true spiderman folks not find this film a good adaptation at all.  Well, considering the movie made $400 million at the box office and 2 more sequels are in the works, surely somebody thought it was well done!  <br />Kirsten Dunst is truly cute in this movie and Tobey McGuire and her seem to have this little shy connection between them...do they get together in the end?  I can't tell you of course and the nice surprise at the end makes this for a fun film to watch.
0151008116|3.0|Life of Pi is a vivid and entertaining story of a boy lost at sea. But it did not live up to it claims of  &quot;making me believe in god&quot;. In fact other than  recognizing the boys wide expanse of religious faiths and his miraculously long survival in the Pacific this book sparked little spiritual introspection.<br />If you want a survival story read this book if you want spiritual enlightenment read the Bhagavad Gita.
0553296981|5.0|I read the book in middle school and I thought that it was excellent. It has led my 8th grade class to more and more research and it is a great topic. This was very sad and It is easy to relate to.

Let's just say that due to Marla's wonderful ideas and constant support via daily emails, on December 5 my Christmas shopping is finished, my gifts are wrapped and under my tree, the house is completely decorated, my Christmas cards are mailed, my cookies are baked, and for the rest of December, I am going to do nothing but enjoy the wonderful holiday season.  If you need a break from your perfectionist self, set a timer for 15 minutes and check out her website...you won't regret it!
0060934700|3.0|The thing about short story collections is that, if one story doesn't grab you, another will. While some of the stories are hits, others are misses. But fans of Gaiman's other works (particularly Neverwhere) shouldn't miss this one.
6305508550|5.0|This is my favorite movie EVER.. if you've ever thought \\"man i'd just like to do nothing, and not go to work\\"(Which is everyone) you will LOVE this movie!! I watch it like once a week. and have for the past 5 years!It's so funny!!
0525946284|4.0|I wasn't planning to review this book, but I decided I had to when I saw one reviewer mention that the sex diluted the story. That's absolutely ridiculous! There's one particularly descriptive scene, but other than that it does nothing to hamper the plot.<br />This book was highly enjoyable. I found myself reading chapter after chapter even after I had decided to stop reading for the night.

0676973779|5.0|This is one of the most powerful novels I have ever read.  It begins with a section that builds up the main character flawlessly.  Then it shifts to wonderfully written story of survival, exploring almost every angle of human nature in the face of adversity.  It delves into relationships in the most interesting of ways, and makes one think twice about their own.  The third and final section of the book brings a bit of a twist in the plot; it left me enjoying the book in it's entirity even more.  It is one of those feel good books, which I could not put down.
0140177396|5.0|Aside from its stature as a classic of American literature and a masterwork of one of the 20th century's most significant writers, there is a reason why OF MICE AND MEN is an ubiquitous part of high school literature courses. This novella follows the structure of Fiction Writing 101 perfectly: Characters are introduced in broad strokes and allowed to fill in their personalities on their own. There is a completeness of scene, so much so that the story reads almost more like a play, with no action in any of the chapters taking place outside of the setting where the chapter began. (In one instance, the characters run off set, but the narrator leaves the reader's \\"camera\\" on an unpopulated stage while he describes voices and shouting outside.) Most of all, the story follows the perfect three-act structure so neatly that, in a 100-page copy, the characters are all introduced by about page 33, and the turning point happens almost precisely on page sixty-seven.    But if the mechanics of Steinbeck's storytelling make this perfect for eighth grade teachers looking to fill out a lesson plan, it's his story that has put it high on the list of Books Everyone Should Read. All of the characters are given a fair chance to be sympathetic. (Only one, the violent, jealous, bullying Curley fails to accomplish that, but he fails on his own terms, not because the author needs a cardboard heavy.) The most memorable, however, is Lennie, the hulking, gentle-natured behemoth with the mind of a child, a victim swept along towards his tragic end by ironic twists of fate he could never possibly hope to understand.    With characters this richly layered and one of the easiest storytelling styles Steinbeck would ever have, particularly in comparison to such later, more impressionistic masterpieces as THE GRAPES OF WRATH and EAST OF EDEN, it's not hard to see why OF MICE AND MEN is one of the rare examples of a novel written very much about its time that has nonetheless proven to be timeless.
0517189542|4.0|I thought the book was rather good. It was kind of easy to read and easy to follow. I also liked it because it was about four sisters. I think books with sisters it in are good for children to read so they no what other ppl think its like to have sisters. Then ending was really cute too.
0679601686|5.0|This is a wonderful book with a wonderful theme that is a good lesson for everyone to learn.  I loved all of the characters and even if I didn't love their actions, I loved the artful description of them.  Though in the beginning I really did not like Mr. Darcy, by the end he was one of my favorite characters along with Elizabeth.  The ending was great and I was very satisfied with it.  It had a great plot and kept me looking forward to the next part.  Another great thing about, while it was described wonderfully, it was not confusing and I was able to follow the story the whole way through the book.  I also thought that the whole time period back then, though it had many bad aspects like a great rift between the very rich and others, was still a great time period with manners and etiquette that we in this time are lacking.  Overall I really loved the book and am looking forward to reading other Jane Austen books.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I was skeptical about this album for alot of reasons. I am a fan, but her last album wasnt exactly grammy materia. This one is. She has gotten out of that over singing every little note phase and is now showing how versatile and talented she really is.  I think alot of people expected a second album some what like a certain  \\"singers\\" third, where she was supposed to seem different but it was the same [stuff]. The albums best songs are nearly all of them. She got a little out of hand in \\"dirrty\\" the video but dont judge stripped by that. Buy it...you will love it.

No one will go wrong with this system, stay at home moms, working moms, single people, if you have kids or not...anyone and any age will benefit from this program.  It is simple, uplifting and fun. It makes you look forward to starting the next day and gives you a whole new attitude on life.

This is the answer you have been looking for.
B00000IN5G|5.0|I must hand it to Alexi and the lads...Hatebreeder was a huge transitional album for my metal listening career, bridging the gap between metal beginnings (such as Metallica and Rage Against the Machine) and true metal insanity!<br />When I first heard \\"Warheart\\" and \\"Downfall,\\" I thought \\"this is the most outrageous stuff I've ever heard!  The 'singer' sounds like he's got a dying toad for a voice the keyboards are annoying.\\"  Oh, such a shallow thing can a first impression be!  Something oddly drew me back to these songs time and again.  I didnt know why I was lured back time and again to play these songs on my computer, but something about the outright savagery and amazing talent this band has pulled me right in.<br />Before I knew it, I had bought the album and became a diehard COB fan.  Despite the speed, harsh vocals, and plentiful brutality, this album singlehandedly got me into underground metal; not of any one particular classification though...\\"death metal\\" alone isn't enough for COB.  The vocals and keys are quite blackish, but the superbly constructed neoclassical elements give it roots in melody and the guitar-drum attack is powerful thrash.<br />From the moment you put this CD in, you'll be drawn in to the masterfully built savagery of Alexi Laiho.  The speed of \\"Warheart\\" and \\"Silent Night...\\" will break your neck while the heavy groove of \\"Bed of Razors\\" puts you fresh in a killing mood.  Laiho is a superb soloist and could well become a new 'guitar hero,' assuming his keyboardist Janne Warman doesn't become a 'keyboard hero' first.  Laiho and Warman often duel during solos and the result is mesmerising.  Backed by melodic-thrash riffs that gain their power from the skill of their crafting instead of the velocity of pure speed and the tight, yet manic drum barrage, you end up with a truly powerful record.<br />I recommend Hatebreeder to absolutely anybody who's looking for something beyond the undeniable, but limited power of Metallica and wants to taste the bounty that lies in the underground European metal scene.  In addition, their first album Something Wild is equally powerful, if not a bit short, though Hatebreeder's follow-up entitled Follow the Reaper is weaker. With Hatebreeder, Alexi and co. will smash your virgin brain to little gory pieces for the Reaper to harvest and leave you wanting so much more.  This is definitely the metal album of the year.
B00006LFGD|4.0|Who is to blame:  Barbra?  SONY?<br />DUETS is a nice idea for the casual fan or for the fan who has no idea what to get his parents for a stocking stuffer.<br />The Groban duet is wonderful (you actually feel Barbra trying to sing as opposed to snoozing her way through the Manilow song; or her last few albums. . . ).<br />The insult is that the magnificent medley of ONE LESS BELL/A HOUSE is cut off at the end by about five seconds.  This was the problem with the first CD release of BARBRA JOAN STREISAND, the 1971 album from which the track comes.  This gross error coupled with her brief tribute to Peter Matz (the conductor of the track) in DUETS is a crying shame.  I am sure Mr. Matz's family is not thrilled with this sloppy mistake and I hope it is corrected.<br />So much for artistic integrity. . . <br />Otherwise, if you have a handful of her work and need a CD for the car, go buy it.  Just don't RUN WILD. . .
0812550706|5.0|This has got to be the best book I've ever read. Although it has a bit of mature language and fighting, it's a great book. I'd say that people around 13 would understand it best. <br />Ender lives in the future. He is tested, and passes, to join the Battle School. It is a school that trains kids in combat for careers in the military, to fight the buggers. The Buggers are an alien race that threaten humanity. Ender is the best hope they've got. But he's just a kid. <br />It's a really neat book, and I think anyone who understands it will like it. If you like it, like I do, then try the other five books in the series. Read this one first, though, or else you won't understand any of it.
B000005ILF|4.0|Five records along, Sting has successfully dethroned his image as the &quot;King Of Pain&quot;, sounding more optimistic (with one exception) each time we hear him. Even so, he still has a serious side, but his tempering of that with his unique jazz-rock sound make it an increasing pleasure to hear. &quot;Mercury Falling&quot; is one of the more multifaceted gems in the former Policeman's collection, and the variety is what keeps the audience tuned in.<br />The album opens with two jam pieces, the lonely, slow-burning &quot;Hounds Of Winter&quot; and the penitent, solo-driven &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;. On &quot;Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot&quot;, Sting is appropriately backed up by a choir for an uplifting advising of faith for the downtrodden. &quot;I Was Brought To My Senses&quot; drones through a moody intro, and then a happier vibe flows from the romance-laden verses. The album is anchored in the middle by the R&amp;B drenched &quot;You Still Touch Me&quot;, where he sings about feeling the spirit of an absent lover, and his belated lament on a failed marriage &quot;...I Can't Stop Crying&quot;, whose country-flavored motif was echoed three years later in &quot;Fill Her Up&quot;. &quot;All Four Seasons&quot; is a variant on the score of &quot;When We Dance&quot;, but it has a more appealing jazz flavor. The rather low point of the album would be &quot;La Bell Dame Sans Regrets&quot;,  difficult to appreciate for those who don't speak French. &quot;Valpariso&quot; is a beautiful sea ballad which would have fit nicely on &quot;Soul Cages&quot;, and simple, confident lyrics combined with a danceable acoustic beat makes &quot;Lithium Sunset&quot; a worthy finale.<br />As usual, the album gives us few clues as to what we'll hear from Sting next, but getting there has always been the heart of a musical experience, something Sting remembers when many others don't. No matter how far the mercury falls, it seems apparent that this is not the winter of Sting's musical evolution. What's to come will probably only sound better!n. What's to come will probably only sound better!
0553382179|5.0|I was convinced that I needed to buy a new (bigger) house, but once I realized I was living in CHAOS (and that somebody knew what that was and had been there too) and that before I rushed right out to buy that new place I had some decluttering to do -- I got right to it.  15 minutes at a time over only about a month (long enough to establish a habit) I discovered that my house was plenty big enough -- I just needed to stop housing all that clutter and instead decide that the rooms needed only to hold essentials -- and that the only true essentials were my family and me.  <br />Now, the effects of the book are reaching into every area of my life -- my Christmas present selection (I don't want to give something that will just be clutter in the hands of the recipient), my purse, my budget, my exercise, my diet, my LIFE.  <br />It is absolutely amazing.   Yes, there is a certain amount of &quot;religious&quot; content.  I just substitute the word epiphany for God Breeze -- and keep on reading.  <br />The website (and the daily flow of emails and testimonials) are amazingly wonderful.  The best part of the book and of the system is -- we clutter-maniacs are not alone and just knowing that someone else has suffered the pain of being so messy that you are afraid to have anyone see your house is comforting -- and inspires us FlyBabies to get moving for the next 15 minutes to make one little spot just that much better. <br />Also, I would like to reply to the &quot;irreducible chore and it MUST take a certain amount of time&quot; comment:  If when I get up in the morning and in using the bathroom sink while brushing my teeth just happen spend time wiping the sink and counter (time I would be standing there anyway) -- is that time spent cleaning or time spent brushing my teeth?  I realize that it is both, but that is just one tiny example of how that &quot;certain irreducible amount of time&quot; can be handled.  <BR>If in cooking dinner you clean up along the way, is that cooking or cleaning?<BR>If in clearing the table nothing gets stacked in the sink (where it pauses for a week before it makes it to the dishwasher) but just goes straight into the dishwasher, is that clearing or cleaning?<BR>If you know what you are going to wear tomorrow because you have laid it out the night before (and have noticed if the skirt needs hemming or the blouse needs to be ironed -- and so handled it in a few minutes that night), is that just being prepared or is that cleaning?<br />Above all -- I have discovered that I have too much (and don't need to buy or receive any more) -- and I have discovered the blessings that come to me from giving my too much away to people who have too little.  <br />And all from this little bitty book.  BUY IT or go to flylady.net!
6304076517|5.0|If you haven't read William Shakespeare's The Tempest, this film will likely confuse you. That being said, it's probably one of the most elegant and rich films I've seen. The Tempest is my favorite Shakespearean plays, so to see it done in such a clever and non-traditional way was refreshing.<br />The film is ripe with colors and sounds and movements that make you feel as though you are surrounded by the spirits which are so abundantly portrayed in the film. At first I was a bit confused by the purpose of a multitude of naked people with seemingly little purpose, but once I fell into the rhythm of the film it made perfect sense. The film was able to capture, as a staged version of this play couldn't, what it was like for Prospero to be constantly surrounded by spirits and faeries (i.e. the naked people).<br />If you are a lover of Shakespeare, or merely well done film, I highly recommend this film. Sir John Gielgud gives an outstanding performance and proves why he was, and remains, one of Britain's top Shakespearean actors.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is another bizarre cruise of a story, and it will suck you in and not let you go until the very last moment. Like Jeunet's great early effort \\"Delicatessen\\", this movie is filled with some pretty weird characters, and the story evolves from a mosaic of moments that are little story gems in themselves. The main character of the movie, Amelie, is a waitress in a typical Paris bistro, but her solitary life is far from ordinary, as is her upbringing. Bent on the mission of helping people (in her own twisted way), she sets out on several adventures. The discovery of a small metal box hidden behind one of her bathroom tiles by a child some forty years ago sends her on a chase to find this person and reunite him with the lost treasure. At the same time she chases her own luck and love by engaging the guy of her fancy in a chase across Paris. All of the above does a limited if not poor job in describing what goes on in this  bizarre, yet fun and highly entertaining movie that will involve you completely if you allow it to. The cinematography is wonderful alone. Let Amelie into your life and imagination, you won't regret it.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a book that depicts a \\"perfect\\" world starring the 12-year-old Jonas, who is a normal and completely perfect boy. He is living in a normal and completely perfect world, living a normal and completely perfect family. There are no lies, no deception, no dishonesty, no hate, no war, no illness, no evil, and no good. Everything is gray so there is no racism, and everyone looks the same. Among all of these identical blobs of gray is Jonas who- on his twelfth birthday awaits to be assigned a job form the community. He finds he is different than many of his friends who where chosen as workers, doctors, nurses, and laborers. For Jonas was the new Receiver of Memories... In which only the giver, and elderly old man, can give to him. All he can offer is memories of relaxation, of pain, of color, of light, of good, of bad, and of a different Utopia other than the only one Jonas was used to.<BR>Jonas was different. He (as the receiver of memories) was allowed to lie, he could manipulate, and he could see color. Like the red of an apple or a patch of wheat blonde hair. In a world where there is no emotion the giver exposes Jonas to love, and to hate. To fear and pain and the cold and the heat.  It is with this understanding and this emotion that he understands he must overthrow the community. He realizes the true insanity of the world around him, and the pure evil of his brainwashed friends and family. This book strives for individuality and freedom of self.
B000002AZ8|2.0|I love &quot;Corduroy,&quot; and &quot;Not For You,&quot; &quot;Better Man,&quot; and &quot;Immortality&quot; belong on a hypothetical Best-of collection, but the rest is a confused, disjointed mess.  It's impossible to listen to this one from beginning to end.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I have seen reviews for this flick that go both ways. Here is my take. I watched this film expecting nothing. -SUPRISINGLY- I found this flick entertaining. Do not rent this expecting a horror film. It is simply a movie about a video game. I will warn you that this is a film that starts kind of slow. Be patient for the first 15 -20 minutes. When the team finally gets to the red queens lair you will have been suprised once. I will not ruin it for you. Pay attention to what the teams mission is and try to figure out the relationaship between the two people (Jovavich and the guy found on the train). Try to figure out who is the \\"badguy\\". This is a enjoyable film if you go into it not expecting it to be the best film of the year (although hollywood is producing less and less competiton each year). This film does have kind of a cool ending. It is not your typical hollywood movie ending which is nice to see once and awhile. Enjoy!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Finally. It has been a long time since a CD that rocks as much as this was released.  If you were expecting a Rage sound, you may be disappointed.  If you're a Soundgarden fan, you will definately not be.  If you like both, even better.  Cochise (first single release) sounds the most like a Rage song than any other track on the CD.  If you have heard only this song and no others, don't judge the CD by it.. Not that Cochise is bad, but there's some songs on here that really rock.  Songs like Exploder, Gasoline, and Show Me How to Live...awesome.  This is a must have CD for any Soundgarden fan.

B000002J20|2.0|Hearing a live version of &quot;Revealing Science of God&quot; on Keys to Ascension cleared up a lot of my confusion about Tales from Topographic Oceans. The problem with this album is that the music needed to be road-tested before it was recorded. &quot;Revealing Science&quot; on Tales sounds disjointed and cobbled together to me--the overall dynamic is unclear, the instrument tones do not mesh well--while the live version on Keys I sounds like a coherent piece of music and stands up to repeated listenings (and is now one of my favorite listening experiences). The version on the album comes from exploratory sessions in the studio and basically amount to demos, while 25+ years of live playing have helped the band discover the true dynamics, nuance and tonal continuity inherent in the music but not brought to fruition on the &quot;demoed&quot; studio version. It's not the music and the length, I now realize, but the production and the way the album was recorded and pasted together in the studio. Go for any live versions you can find of this music instead. I really wanted to like this album, but I now realize the production specific to this recording really does not do the music justice.
0553382179|5.0|For some people, this may be yet another book that they buy in hopes of finding some miracle solution for helping them clean their messy homes. But unless you put the suggested routines in place and actually get off your &quot;franny&quot; and do something, this book will not be the cure. However, if you are truly ready to learn to love your home and yourself, this book is  for you. <br />What I loved about Sink Reflections was the fact that it seemed like Marla Cilley was talking directly to me. She doesn't berate the reader for being a slob, but instead explains how the perfectionism that some of us strive for actually stands in the way of our progress. We have to learn to take &quot;baby steps&quot; and do a little bit at a time and be happy with our progress, even if it is slow.  <br />Although some of the suggestions, like always wearing lace-up shoes, and shining your sink may seem silly and pointless, once you begin doing this, you will see how much of a difference these things make. <br />One of the biggest helps I found in the book was the concept of decluttering. I have always been a pack rat, saving things I might be able to use someday or feeling like I had to hold onto stuff because I spent money on it. The FlyLady system inspired me to get rid of so much stuff that it has been easier to keep the house much cleaner just by donating or throwing away items I no longer loved or needed. <br />And finally, the biggest thing that the FlyLady teaches us in Sink Reflections is that it's all about your attitude. You have to believe that you are worth it and that you want and deserve a clean and happy home. It's amazing how all the other chaos in your life (finances, scheduling, relationships) also begin to fall into place, just by applying some of the principles found in this book. <br />Get the book. Read it. And then begin your flight. You won't be disappointed.
B000002LIM|5.0|The title says it all.  This is not only Danny Elfman's finest work, but it's one, if not the, best score ever.  It was the first score I ever purchased (like most teenagers, I hadnt even heard of scores before this), and now I am a collector of movie scores.  This is heart pounding, wonderful, and very fun music.  You can't call yourself a music buff and not own this.  Brilliant job, Danny Elfman.
0151008116|4.0|This book was a surprise even after reading the reviews and descriptions.  Martel created characters, both human and otherwise, who were believable and consistent with themselves and with nature in general.  He treats all of his characters with great respect for their natural integrity.  I expected at some time an unreal breakthrough, warm and fuzzy, but it never came, as it rarely would in real life.  This is not warm and fuzzy! Parts are very brutal, but THE LIFE OF PI is never boring nor predictable.  Great book, especially for animal lovers.
B00005JKBC|2.0|This film is so full of unnecessary camera shakes, pans, dollies and zooms that after a while it all becomes a rather pointless eye exercise. Also the fast paced music never stops for an instant, which seems to be the copyright of so many bad action-thriller movies cropping up recently . If it was a 5 min. music video this I could endure, but at 2 hours it made me want to puke. Also I tried not to fall asleep watching more than half an hour of pointless and boring close up shots of ugly blokes in a darkened meeting room staring and squinting at each other, at documents etc. The totally unlovable character of Robert Redford made it impossible for me to identify with him, while Brad Pitt was same as always, not bad, not outstanding.
B000068QY7|4.0|People...Noel is the elder of the Gallaghers, and Liam is the younger.  This album is fantastic, and makes up very much for all of their shortcomings as individuals (ie Liam's public brawls).  However, many people seem to regard Liam as the better singer, but Noel's voice does not have that annoying whine that Liam seems to embrace.  I rather like Noel's voice and think that he should try to sing more often!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|honestly, this is the best album i've bought in a very long time.  if you're looking for some great semi-downer-rock, i can't recomend this enough.  best i can describe it is Gang of Four meets doors meets joy division (although the constant joy division comparisons are a bit unfair, Interpol definately has its own sound)  after you buy this, look up the liars.  new york is puting out some fine music lately.
1573229725|5.0|This really is a book that'll keep you up til you finish it.  I sped through the last chapter and didn't get to bed until after 2 am.  PLUS, as one blurb says happened to that reviewer, I did have a dream I was in a madhouse and that my roommate was the nurse in her bed.  Freaked me out.  It's a sign of how involving this book is.<br />One issue I had was reading that this was considered lesbian fiction.  Why?  It's a story of two people who fall in love and just happen to be girls.  We don't call other stories &quot;heterosexual fiction,&quot; right?  This is simply good literature.  No, it's *excellent* literature.  Read this book, and fall in love with the girls yourself.
B00005ATQF|5.0|This is by far one of the better war movies out there. Athough i have heard it can be confusing to the first time viewer it is an absolutly great film. Even though not a comedy, the film has humerous twist.
B00005YW4H|5.0|My father bought this CD about 6 months ago....and I had never heard of her.  Only upon hearing &quot;don't know why&quot; on the radio, did I ask him to borrow it.  To my surprise, my dad discovered something fabulous.  I absolutely love her CD...its jazzy sound is so relaxing and soothing. This would be a perfect present for the holidays...I guarantee that anyone with a clue about music will enjoy it as much as I have.
B0000640VO|5.0|My daughter and I watched this initally as a pay per view.<BR>Wonderful French based movie with terrific characters<BR>and mystery!   If you wanted to know where the Gnome<BR>in Paris VW commercial idea came from it was this movie.<BR>Very romantic and funny.  We will be buying this DVD.<BR>Too bad there are not more movies like this one out there!
B00006M183|3.0|Firstly I think this album is worth 3 and a half stars out of five. It is definitely an album worth buying and listening to, even for casual fans. However, having said this, I don't know whether this will remain as an album strong enough to listen to in five years time. I am one of those amongst many that have followed Pearl Jam since near the beginning, originally hooked on Daughter, and have since never looked back with them remaining the one band I constantly keep tabs on. Every album release I await with huge anticipation, and am always hoping for a tour, which is locked in for February for me now.<br />Riot Act is a solid album, and a big improvement on their last and worst album Binaural, but it certainly lacks in areas. Without wanting a repeat of Ten, Vs, or Vitalogy, I want to hear songs that have the melody and harmony that were displayed on their earlier releases. I think you can still be progressive whilst maintaining this type of standard. I don't want another Ten or Vs, I want Pearl Jam to reach the same musical heights of songs such Daughter, Elderly Woman, Corduroy, Betterman, RearViewMirror, Black, Smile, Alive, etc. What these have that the newer songs don't, is first class melodies and Vedder vocals so strong, clear, and well sung. It seems his more recent vocals are getting closer to being spoken than being sung like on songs such as Jeremy or Betterman. You can still be new, hard, and soft, but encompass it with true melody and strong, clear vocals.<br />Having made this point, I would like to name the high points on Riot Act. Save You, Love Boat Captain, Thumbing My Way, Get Right, and Green Disease are the pick of the bunch, particularly Green Disease which probably comes the closest to the melody and vocals I have discussed. I look forward to the tour in February which is always of the highest standard, the Rarities album next year, and their next studio album. Let's hope they can tighten it all up to produce their best album yet.
0380788624|5.0|This is my favorite of all of Neal Stephenson's works.<BR>It has two stories running in two time periods (WWII and <BR>present day).

B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave's self-titled debut is a thundering display of the talent that can be witnessed by the combination of superstars from two excellent, defunct bands.  An album that has sky-high expectations, Audioslave doesn't disappoint.  The opening track, &quot;Cochise&quot;, relies on Tom Morello's distinct guitarwork to pave the way for the rest of the album, reaching high notes on the tracks &quot;Set It Off&quot; and &quot;Exploder.&quot;  Overall, Audioslave's first effort, gleaming of the remnants of Rage and taking the listener back to the times of Ultramega OK, is a lovely album and is a must-have for rock fans.  -Big Nick
0553382179|5.0|This book is fantastic.  If you're one of those people who were not born organized, this is the book you need to buy.  I always wanted a clean, tidy home, but I had a million excuses on why I couldn't do it.  No more!
6304698690|5.0|The Secret Garden is without a doubt in my list of top five movies, and will doubtless remain there for the rest of my life. Why it was never a big box-office hit baffles me, as it is nearly perfect in every particular. Adults are just as able to enjoy this movie as their children are (or perhaps even more so!) and though the main character is a girl, the presence of two back-up male characters make this accessible to the reluctant boys.<br />Mary Lennox is a spoilt, bitter ten-year old girl living in India with her neglectful parents. After an earthquake leaves her an orphan however, she is shipped to Misselthwaite Manor, the cold, gloomy home of her uncle, still grieving over the death of his wife (Mary's mother's twin sister). There she is put in to the care of the strict housekeeper Mrs Medlock (admirably preformed by Maggie Smith) and warned not to go poking about in the endless corridors and passageways of the house. However, Mary is used to doing exactly as she pleases, and with the dual finding of a secret passage in her bedroom and the friendship of the cheerful, sweet maid Martha, Mary is soon roaming the grounds of the estate. There she meets Martha's younger brother, the kind-hearted country boy Dickon who can speak to animals and a red-breasted robin that reveals to her a garden hidden behind a wall of ivy...a secret garden.<br />Untangling the mystery of why this sad and beautiful garden is locked away takes Mary back to the tragic past of the house and her uncle - to when her aunt Lilias fell of a swing in the garden just before she gave birth and died, leaving Lord Archibald Craven a broken man, who cannot stand the sight of the Spring, the garden, or his son.<br />This son, Colin Craven is who Mary discovers one night after following the sound of his wailing. Colin is convinced he is going to become a hunchback like his father and die, but with the opening of the secret garden and its rebirth under the care of the three children means that his health gradually restores. Now all the children want is to bring his father home for similar healing, and the only way to do it seems to be to call on magical forces...<br />The three child actors are truely wonderful - Kate Maberly manages to make a spoilt young girl into a likeable, even relatable character and her transformation from a child who couldn't cry even at her parent's deaths to one that breaks down when she witnesses her uncle and his son walk off without her is beautifully created.<br />Heydon Prowse as the impatient, ungrateful Master Colin is another child starved of love, but his obession with death, germs and diseases means he is suffering more in the mind than in body. His frequent fits (or temper tantrums, more likely) means that his mother's garden (that definitly still holds his mother's spirit) can help him also make the change from unloveable and sickly to healthy and strong young boy.<br />However, special credit must be given to Andrew Knott as Dickon Sowerby, who brings a warmth, kindness and mischieviousness to his character that brings joy to the entire movie. He is one of the few 'good-guys' from the very beginning, and in a way the 'Samwise Gamgee' of the movie, not just because he is a kind-hearted simple gardener, but because he is the over-looked hero that ultimately saves the day by just being himself. The fact that the last scene of the movie is of Dickon travelling across the moor on his white pony is a testimony to this.<br />The adult cast also hold up nicely, from Martha to Mrs Medlock, to Ben Weatherstaff to Lord Craven himself. Even the actress that plays both Lilias and Mary's mother has some beautiful scenes, the most poignant being her reaching out to Mary in her dreams, and Lilias's spirit calling to Lord Craven: \\"I'm in the garden! With Colin!\\" Each performance is outstanding work.<br />The photography, directing and set design of the movie is also beautiful and it boasts a lovely, haunting musical score that includes the song 'Winter Light' that has also become one of my favourites. There are themes galore within the movie whether it be the turn of the seasons, the difference between the restrictions of the upper class and the freedom of the lower class, the relationships between various parents and their children, the joy and furfullment that can be found from simple pleasures, and even life triumphing over death. I even picked up on a subtle love triangle - the scene with Dickon and Mary on the swing together while Colin watches from behind the camera is an intriging one - I kinda wish that the film-makers had developed this plot thread further.<br />All in all, this movie has my absolute highest rating, and is as close to a perfect movie you can possibly get. Watch it, no matter who you are or what age you are.er Light' that has also become one of my favourites.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Being a jaded 30 year old, I've heard lots, including the Joy Division and Pixies era and my is great to hear a similar sound again. Frankly, the album is brilliant in every facet. Great feel conveiance, amazing production, stellar song arrangement, and unforgettable melodies.  Not since Radiohead and +/- (Versus side project) have i been so moved.  Having seen them live a few times, they really hold up and them some- graet energy. I am racking my brain for criticisms, but cannot find any.<BR>The First track, Untitled, grabs you by the throat and lulls you. Other strong points are PDA, Stella Was a Diver..,NYC, and on and on.<BR>If they come to your city, I implore you to see them live, they start a 2,000+ venue tour in February. Now I'm of to see e'm in Asbury park, NJ. <BR>Imagine, this is only thier first album!
B00005JL78|4.0|I loved this movie. Storywise and from its flawless special effects, this film is sure to please anyone. I am somewhat of a Steven Spielberg fan, and he's showing no signs of slowing down in the way that he keeps on supplying great entertainment for the whole family.<br />I strongly recommend this film, mainly for reasons already mentionned, and for the fact that this is an original idea for once. See it!
B000002BQK|5.0|This album,with no doubt is Mariah's best .I don't expect her to top this, ever.Every single thing about this disc is perfect, the songs, the lyrics, the arrangements, and her absolutely incredible voice.Yes, who can deny the drastic change from her previous albums(all of which have a special place in my heart), whether in her music, or her new \\"falsetto\\" singing style. But I'm not afraid of change. If change is good, then all for the best. And rarely has an artist made such a drastic change, that sounded so natural, so real and so damn good.<BR>The sound of this album a mixture of r n' b,hip hop, and soul. Every song is heart-felt and beautiful in it's own way. Nothing sounds repetitive, redundant, or uninspired. You can tell Mariah put her all into this album.<br />1.Honey-A great upbeat song. I love the piano in the backround. A sexy,bouncy, and fun song.I think you've all heard it.<br />2. Butterfly- A beautiful,inspirational, mariah ballad.<br />3.My All-The ultimate mariah song. Laced with dark passion, and an undeniably romantic feel.And her voice just soars above all.<br />4. The roof-A mysterious r n'b song with a heavy,electrifying beat.Dark, and smoky.I love this song.<br />5.Fourth Of July-A soft,romantic song that always leaves me feeling uplifted.I really,really love this song.<br />6.Breakdown-Awesome r n'b song with a strong hip-hop element.Great tune, and bone'thugzn 'harmony really sound in place.Even though it's called breakdown, it's a pretty light-hearted song.<br />7.Babydoll-I LOVE THIS SONG SOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!~!!!No really, this is the best song. The verses start out dry, and soon you hear a chorus, which is a passionate concoction of soul/hip hop. How someone CANNOT love this song is beyond me.<br />8. Close My eyes-The only song which doesn't stand out to me as much as the others.Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty nice song, but it fails to grab you like all the rest.<br />9. Whenever You Call- Another BEAUTIFUL Mariah ballad.Except it's kind of strange hearing it WITHOUT Brian Mcnight, but even though I like the duet more, this is still a beautiful song.Her voice is as usual, amazing.<br />10.Fly Away (butterfly reprise)-It is meant to be a reprise, but it's really as full-length song.Kind of like a dance version of butterfly.It's ok, but it's pretty pointless.<br />11.The Beautiful Ones-I neverc knew it was a cover, until I started reading the reviews.The song is stunning, even though it's too long.Dru Hill sounds wondeful,and so does Mariah, although I wish there was more of her.All in all, excellent.<br />12.Outside-OH MY LORD!!!My favorite song on he whole cd!!It is a majestic ballad, that really does tear you apart.<br />I'm ashamed to say I didn't listen to this cd for years.I kept in a stash along with other cd's which I thought I would never need.I'm glad I gave it another chance, and discovered the treasure that lurked beneath.If you are a true music lover, then this is an album that you should not be without.How anyone cannot LOVE this album, I do not know.It is a landmark, and this album will live on forever in the name of mariah carey.
B000001Y42|1.0|My son made me listen to this. While I'm glad he was willing to share his interests, I have to say this is really awful. Really. Kids these days a so unfortunate. They don't get any good music or culture and they use this junk to fill the void. I don't even think my son likes it, I think he just wants to be popular. Isn't that sad? If only kids had music like Buffalo Springfield, which expressed angst and outrage in a sophisticated manner, instead of this destructive, ugly, hateful waste.
B00006879E|4.0|Take one sneak peak into new bands these days and if you want to find raw talent you have located Maroon 5.  The pop/rock/soul combination had made this band a complete first album. <BR>With there hit song Harder to Breath these 5 young guys who debueed 1997 with there album The Fourth World with the name as Kara's Flowers. Now as the band prepares to debut there brand new C.D. with a new name called Maroon 5. <BR> With quotes like, \\"Is there anyone out there, cause its getting harder and harder to breath.\\"  With there brand new video just realesed by Octone Records it shows the 5 members rocking out to there future. <BR> Though as the sound of music sounds just like what you will here on the radio stations like 91X and 933 every day, but there is something   unique about the band, it is not the usual boy band music. The CD contains addictive, energetic, innovate pure funk rock.

0446530573|4.0|One doesn't generally think of cookbooks as entertaining, but this one is.  That's just a bonus, however, as the fulsome, tongue-in-cheek, rambling escapades of the Soprano's and their &quot;associates' juxtapose against some very fine Italian recipes.  <br />I'm only a casual Soprano viewer but, nevertheless, I found the character spiels quite entertaining.  They are just wacky/tacky enough for entertainment without roaming into the completely absurd-or worse, boring.<br />We've tried several recipes and found all excellent. They are well and logically displayed, the instructions are clear, and the lists of ingredients complete.<br />The book does have one down side-these are not, on the whole, low fat offerings.  I suppose the \\"family\\" worldview is if we can't get you one way, we can get you another!<br />Probably snobby cooks will roll their eyes and pooh-pooh the whole thing, but for the rest of us these folks have created a wonderfully useful oxymoron-a fun cookbook!
B00006RU5B|2.0|Listening to these songs makes me physically uncomfortable.  It's not Rage and it's not Soundgarden.  The vocals and the instrumentals just don't mesh very well.  Throughout the entire album I felt like Chris Cornell and Tom Morello were each doing their own thing, without 'speaking' to each other.  Cornell's prolonged yells just don't suit the music very well at all.  It's obvious that Tom Morello is still brilliant, but some of the riffs sound recycled, and the rhythm section plays an uncharacteristically low-key role.  The tempo of the CD is unRagely slow -- mostly because Cornell's vocals are somewhat sluggish.  He certainly doesn't have Zack's agility.<br />On a different note, I looked at the Audioslave (the name's a little weak isn't it?) website.  Though the band attempts to keep one foot in politics, the content and selections just don't have the personalized, hand-picked feel that Zack's material had.<br />In a nutshell, it feels like both parties deviated from their extremes in an attempt to accomodate each other, and the result is a watery Frankenstein monster.
0553583182|5.0|This book can easily be also named \\"The power of the Spirit\\". I have read a lot of phsycology and self-help books for about 10 years and I find this one the most practical and understandable. As a christian men I see that it explains many biblical concepts the \\"occidental way\\". This book has opened my eyes wider and now I can read the Bible in a different, scientific and most accurate perspective. I highly recommend this book for those who really wish in their hearts to turn into a different and more powerful person for the good. Mr. Murphy was a real evangelist.
B00006V9A0|3.0|As a long time fan of Nirvana, I was very excited to get my hands on this compilation cd.  But I was a little disappointed While it's a powerful mix of radio air hits, it is lacking in its ability to embody the true force of Nirvana.  Since I already own all the other albums, I felt this cd was a convenient way to hear some of my favorite songs without switching around cd's.  But I would have been much more impressed with a release of some rare nirvana gems headlined by &quot;you know you're right&quot;...  <BR>   I do feel that this cd is in direct violation of Kurt's attempt not to give in to commercial merchandising, which is what this cd is all about.  This album can only be described as Cliff's Notes for people who are too lazy to enjoy the entire experience of Nirvana.<BR>   I think it's pretty clear that Nirvana fans are still a little touchy and a lot protective of one of the greatest and most influential hard rock/indie bands of all time. We do not want to see the band's amazing music to become besmirched by money hungry record companies.  <BR>   But hell, everyone can admit it would be very nice to see Nirvana back on the charts again.  And maybe, just maybe, it's a way to get the bittersweet taste of Nirvana into the mouth's of non-listeners.  We can only hope.
B000035P7X|5.0|This is by far one of the best glimpes of Dylan you can get on tape, minus bootlegs that are floating out there. If you are a devout Dylan fan or merely a fair weather fan (do they exist?) and have not seen this yet, you are in for a treat. There are so many amazing scenes that made me stop in my tracks, cooking, talking, smoking, whatever I was doing at the time a scene such as when he plays 'love minus zero no limit' acoustic, and I swear, chills and a tear of unexplainable emotion in rhetoric surfaced. And every time I watch this documentary, the same emotions arise in me...there is a scene where Joan Baez sings bits of, 'love is just a four letter' and 'Percy's son'.....just beautiful, I wish that she would have recorded a version of 'Percy's song' as well as the former on an album. In short, I have had 2 copies of this tape, both of which have been ruined somehow in the hustle and bustle of life, and currently I am living in a foreign country but suddenly wanted to watch this again, so I came to Amazon.com and when I was browsing the site is said, \\"Do you want to write a review?\\" and I thought, why not, I have something to say about this. If you are a Dylan fan...
0060512806|5.0|This book is simply amazing. Don't let its size prevent you from reading it. Stephenson is a very talented writer and I'm surely going to read other books he's written.<br />Now let me try to explain Cryptonomicon for someone who doesn't know a lot about the book.<br />First: the book is divided in two stories, told togheter through the book, although they are separated by fifty years. One passes in the present time, more or less (1998), and its main characters are a bunch of people involved in a project to create a data heaven (something like the Cayman islands, but related to information and means to provide a steady flux of that information) in a tiny sulatanate near the Philipines. The main characters in this part of the story are Randy Waterhouse and Amy Shaftoe, people in charge of implementing that data heaven. The other is set during the second world War, when Lawrence Waterhouse is the brilliant mathematician in charge of decrypting the Axis war codes, and Bobby Shaftoe is the semi-crazy all-terrain soldier in charge of an Army detachment sent on contraditory errands whose intent is not letting the germans and japanese discover that their codes have already been broken. It seems complicated and it is, but Stephenson's style of narrative adjusts well to the dificulties of telling such a strange story. The last names of the characters are, not casually, identical in both parts of the story.<br />Second: there is another division in the plot. This one is not time-related. Suddenly, in the present-time storyline as much as in the World War storyline, there begins a race to discover the lost gold the japanese and the germans were hidding somewhere along the Pacific Rim, involving characters of both timelines! And that's where I was impressed with Stephenson. He was able to write the same plot within two totally different eras. And all this is written in a very intelligent way; Stephenson lays clues of one time story into the other one! Amazing.<br />The characters are really well developed. Stephenson writes not only about what was supposesd to be in the book, but also of ancient computer systems, greek mythology, theology, and many other stuff, that, instead of transforming Cryptonomicon in a boring book, makes it really one of the best I've read in my life. But the eventual reader will have to take his time with this one. This isn't intended to be a fast read. This is intended to be a fantastic read, so go slow and always, and, in the end, you'll be rewarded.<br />Grade 9.7/10cters are really well developed.

B000003KCU|3.0|---<br />...with an unfortunate emphasis on the &quot;almost.&quot;<br />The acting and directing talent devoted to EXPLORERS is impressive, and the production values are practically perfect.  What gives this film a less-than-stellar place in the movie pantheon is precisely what most of the customer reviews condemn: those clownish damned aliens who are slugged into the third act in lieu of a climax.<br />All the tension-building so delightfully provided in the first two-thirds of EXPLORERS is wasted by a blow-off that fizzles in a fashion that gives new meaning to the word &quot;disappointment.&quot;  Instead of slapstick, the characters and their efforts warranted something serious, something as good as what you'll read in a *real* Heinlein juvenile (see HAVE SPACESUIT, WILL TRAVEL for the perfect example), making this a peripubescent &quot;buddy&quot; movie that would have been honest-to-ghod memorable.<br />Instead of what it is -- which is exceedingly &quot;almost.&quot;
0451191153|5.0|Rand has written a troubling, thought-provoking work. The novel is troubling in the sense that it skillfully and beautifully portrays the virtues of a philosophy of the self. Though I can't say that I subscribe to the notion that the great society is one dominated by individuals who are entirely (and exclusively) self-interested, I do believe that there is much truth to be found here.<br />For instance, the novel invites the reader to consider the relationship between his state of mind, the society in which he lives, and his own self-knowledge. I wholeheartedly agree with Rand that one must be an individual, that one must be more than the thoughts, the expectations, and the opinions of others. Rand's illustration of the importance of self-knowledge is magnificent, and seems to be more relevant now than ever before. <br />To those intereseted in additional readings on moral philosophy, I highly recommend Personal Destinies by David Norton.
0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse 5 is every bit as good as it's reputation suggests. It is witty, observant, humane, and clever. Vonnegut writes in a deceptively simple prose, but which must have been difficult to have pulled off: namely, the way the story flits from the present to the past and to the future, very often in a single page, but manages to do it without disturbing the effortless flow of the narrative. No mean trick for a writer. A favourite book of mine. I can also recommend some of his earlier books: The Sirens of Titan; Piano Player; Mother Night, and Player Piano. His later books are not so hot; but Slaughterhouse 5 is his masterpiece. Like Heller's Catch 22, with which it has something in common, it is fun to read. My only gripe is with the cover, which is dull beyond belief. Leo and Diane Dillon: We need you. Where are you?
B00007E8V4|4.0|Following an inadvertent lapse in collaboration, approximately two dozen System of a Down songs slipped onto the Internet during a summer press release.  Now, in response to the dispersal of the tracks, sixteen of SOAD's works have congregated on the surprisingly launched LP, Steal This Album!.  This time capsule of thrashing and crooning glory spans the group's existence.<BR>Half of the album's triumph is the distinctive contrast of System's early and present creations.  The acoustic tears of \\"Roulette\\" hail from the band?s creation nine years ago.  The Toxicity-era \\"Innervision\\" creates an incendiary track of torrential, bone-crunching guitar and cascading vocals.  \\"Thetawaves,\\" an obvious specimen from SOAD's 1999 self-titled debut, reflects a dark, detached and ominous attitude.<BR>Intertwined with their name brand power infusions, certain tracks serve as representative to the new sound which System is concocting.  Expect enhanced attention to melody as portrayed by \\"Streamline\\" and its flight-of-the-bumblebee bass line.  Expect a greater range of vocal control: Lead singer Serj Tankian transitions from piercing whispers to liquid harmonies to scathing screams, all seamlessly and all inside of the emotionally engaging \\"Highway Song.\\"  But, first and foremost, expect the unexpected.  Tankian keeps the listener's ears on edge with pure and utter irreverence to the concept of decipherable lyrics.  The chorus of \\"Chic 'n' Stu,\\" in a quasi-military drum march style, proudly blares about \\"pizza pie\\" and \\"pepperoni and green peppers, mushrooms, olives, chives;\\" \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O\\" spatters off rapid fire inanities, such as \\"Jimmy Carter fighting crime with a partner, Lois Lane.\\"<BR>For the unfortunate ones who don't own a System of a Down CD, Steal This Album! offers a panoramic collection of the band's multitude of talent.  For the loyal fans, System's never sounded better.  And, for those who have already \\"stolen\\" This Album, buy it? or steal it again.  The tracks whichoriginally leaked onto the Web were unpolished demos that hadn't been layered with additional backup vocals by guitarist Daron Malakian.  Regardless of how you obtain it, Steal This Album! proves to be the centerpiece of a prosperous hard rock staple.
0345428064|5.0|this is the first of his i've read, and i was suitably impressed. Nick Stone strikes me somewhat as a more realist, more modern James Bond, an ex-SAS man, he now works for the &quot;deniable operations&quot; unit of the British secret service. <br />The book is well written, and easy to read. the pace is fast, the plot is exciting and never lets up. the action is constant, and the ending is full of surprises. <br />Stone is a likeable &quot;hero&quot;, and seems very human. His relationship with Kelly, the young girl he is trying to save, is touching and at times very sad. The book has a fierce realism, borne from the fact that McNab has been there, done that. <br />I would reccomend it.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|When I heard the album, I was devistated by the beauty of it.<BR>What really made me cry, as a Beatles fan, was his cover of In My Life, this one will be played at my funeral. Lennon wrote this for Cash, it seems.<BR>But just buy the album, it is beautifull.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Some bands just can't be touched. Radiohead is a different type of music. They aren't like anything else out there. Its one of those bands that is just uncomparable. If you look at the way things have gone for this band, they've excelled a lot. And this record is proof of that.<br />OK Computer is not some spin off album from something popular. Its a genre all by itself. While many only know Radiohead for &quot;Creep&quot; there's more to this band than just that song. Don't get me wrong &quot;Creep&quot; is a great song, and Pablo Honey is a great record. The Bends, and Amnesiac and Kid A are all great albums. But Ok Computer is the best Radiohead album. I've never listened to something so somber. Its very sad.<br />Right from the beginning till the end, this record just depresses me. I don't know why. Paranoid Android is one of the best tracks here. All of them are great in their own ways. But I see these tracks as the best.<br />Paranoiod Android - The voice in this song is so powerful. The higher riffs aren't really needed IMO. but still a very strong song.<br />Karma Police - Very good song. This is a song that made them extremely popular. A good song.<br />Lucky - I think this is the best track on here. This song is just so true and so beautiful.<br />I highly recommend this CD. Its not for everyone, but its definitely something to pick up and at least give it a spin. Hopefully you won't regret it.<br />peace
B00005RDRO|4.0|This film has been one of my all-time favorite comedies! I have fond meories of watching this movie everytime it was aired on Television. When I saw it was available for DVD I bought it.<BR>The movie is great and that is why it should get five stars....<BR>but Scene 28 on both \\"Widescreen\\" & \\"Fullscreen\\" formats are missing sections of the film. Namely the shot with all the cars crossing the bridge home for a final time, as well as Peter Sellers last joke for the movie regarding the arrival of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson looking for the manor they were just at.<BR>I wrote to Sony Pictures....I hope I get an answer to my complaint.<BR>For those of you who haven't seen the movie...it is worth it...however if you want your movie's complete....well you know what is missing in this DVD.
B000002JSN|5.0|Another classic album from one of hard rocks finest bands, Led Zeppelin. The Album is very diverse n the tracks, but it shows excellance among themsleves. Robert Plant belts out (as usual) on the opener &quot;Custard Pie&quot;. This has their fair share of their styles like acoustic and melodic songs as well as hard and heavy rock songs, but one track shows that they had to be infatuated with Stevie Wonder or someone like him. The Song is Trampled Underfoot, which is like Led Zeppelin trying to be like Stevie Wonder. John Paul Jones has his usual keybord solos and together with Jimmy Page's electric licks give it a little bit of a funk mixed with hard rock. Very tasty indeed. All in all an excellant album, which gets my vote to being one of the best albums of all time.
B00001PE4D|3.0|This is a mildly entertaining teen-market reworking of \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\". Though appealing, it's not a patch on Stephen Frears' definitive 1988 version. Writer/director Roger Kumble brings considerable imagination to the transposition from eighteenth-century France to modern-day Manhattan, but the high drama of psycho-sexual manipulation - the crux of the story and the reason the Frears version succeeds - seems to have been left behind. Ryan Phillipe brings the appropriate predatory menace to his Valmont, and it's good to see Sarah Michelle Gellar playing a bad girl for a change. Reese Witherspoon is also quite convincing as the innocent but not-so-vulnerable virgin who becomes the object of their twisted game. The trailer promised something a little more edgy and quite a bit more arch. As it stands, the whole thing is played with such high-camp affectation that it ends up more comic than cruel. The ending completely - shattering in the Frears version - is less \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" here than it is \\"Dawson's Creek\\". It's helped by an enjoyable pop soundtrack that's often used to wring the requisite emotion from some rather casually written scenes.
B00006JKOM|5.0|This album displays a disregard for what the rest of the world is doing--let alone what is in style at the time.  As is too often the case with fashion, be it music, clothing, furnishing a home etc.  we let the &quot;experts&quot; dictate what is &quot;in&quot; and what is not.  Ray L. (Ian A.) determines for himself that he needs to be himself and not worry about what the rest of world thinks.  In the last frame of the comic, Ray made it big--again.  Just like Ian and Tull, they continue to move along doing what they do.
B000069HZP|4.0|Plagued by memories of his father's suicide, wealthy banker Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) lives in a gilded cage. His roguish kid brother Conrad (Sean Penn) promises a fabulous 48th birthday present which might just bust him out: an invitation to play a mysterious game offered by Consumer Recreation Services, a company dedicated to entertaining the top end of town. Nicholas's life promptly disintegrates. Is it all part of the elaborate game, or has he become embroiled in something far more sinister?  \\"The Game\\" not only plays with contemporary paranoia about upper-class, white-collar vulnerability to scams - it also neatly subverts audience expectations. By putting us in precisely the same position as Nicholas, the film doesn't let us solve the mystery before he does. Though Act 2 of the screenplay wanders, it's easily the best work yet from John Brancato and Michael Ferris (the team who also penned the hideous \\"The Net\\"), and David Fincher elevates it enormously with his slick shooting style and trademark noirish unease.  Douglas is great as the tormented conservative, harried into reclaiming his life, and Penn does wonders with his small but crucial role.  This is a great idea that could have been awful in the wrong hands. Thankfully, it's good.
1577311523|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's book is an insightful resource for living in the moment. I especially found the chapter \\"You are not your mind,\\"<BR>inspiring. Just by reading the possibility that I am separate from the constant positive or negative thoughts I have about myself, others or situations, I felt a sense of freedom. I am able to distingish myself from my thoughts and live my life in a sincere and authentic way. Not as a result of my mind's concept but as a direct expression of whom I am. The idea that Tolle presents of how living in the present moment I am able to discover that I am complete and perfect is also truly remarkable.<br />Another inspiring book about living a meaningful life is called \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work,\\" written by Ariel & Shya Kane. Enlightenment is no longer an elusive state for a chosen few, but has become a realty for many people through insightful and practical guide books such as \\"The Power of Now\\" and \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work.\\" I highly recommend both of these books.
B00006LFGD|3.0|While it's pleasant to have a fairly well-rounded collection of Ms. Streisand's many duets on one CD set, one can't help but hope this will be the last retrospective collection released in the artist's lifetime.  The two new vocal collaborations (with Barry Manilow and Josh Groban, respectively) are enjoyable, but seem to be little more than a commercial move to encourage Streisand fans who already have several CDs containing most of these recordings, to buy them yet again.  The much-anticipated &quot;40th Anniversary&quot; of Ms. Streisand's Columbia recording career turned out to be a colossal disappointment--a year of missed opportunities.  Fervent hopes for the long-delayed (more than 10 years delayed) &quot;Just for the Record&quot; video anthology, or ANY TV or live concert performances DVD were YET AGAIN met with disappointment.  Overall, this is a nice set for novice fans, but those of us who have been buying Ms. Streisand's music for 30 or more years have all the &quot;best of&quot;, &quot;essentials&quot;, and &quot;greatest&quot; that we need.

0743455967|1.0|There is little, if anything, about how to write (on writing) in this book. King recommends reading Strunk and White's \\"On Style as \\"a classic,\\" which is like me recommedning Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" as a classic. (News?) What is interesting about his book is the way in which King unwittingly (I presume) admits that he is a second rate writer, that he is embarassed by his writing, and that he would really like to be appreciated as an \\"Author,\\" rather than merely sold as a writer. He seems to intuit this distinction, and yearns for the higher title. (He spends a lot of time talking about how first rate novelists were often perceived as second rate \\"hacks\\" (King's category) during their lifetimes. And he cannot comprehend why Joyce wrote so few books! Dah.<br />For example, he writes that in high school and college, he took literature and poetry courses, but they weren't worth much--this attitude shows in his writing: sensibility counts. He writes, too, that his books are based on his early love of \\"B horror movies\\": this shows too: his novels are \\"B horror novels.\\" \\"On Writing\\" should be retitled: \\"Confessions of Second Rate Writer,\\" for the book does strongly suggest that this is how Mr. King evaluates his own work. The book tells us that he is embolden (even) to broach a serious topic (style in writing) because he is financially successful, but that there is no relationship between material success in writing and writing well (elegantly, seriously, and meaningfully). The book, then, is a good lesson in this difference, and how it can impact (even) a successful (financially) writer, a wanabe \\"author\\" of note. Financially successful writing is NOT writing well (any ad man can tell you this), and the financially successful writer is not an author and has little to say \\"on writing.\\"

6301963717|5.0|I'm a Coen Brothers fan.  While Fargo and O' Brother tend to garner the most acclaim, I firmly believe this is their finest film.  The characters are developed slowly and consistently, yet the scenes are short and witty.  The dialogue is somewhat film noir, and may sound a bit corny at first.  But you soon realize that this is a period piece and the jargon is true to the Roaring Twenties.  <br />I didn't find the plot complex.  It is intelligent and unpredictable.  Each time I watch it, I catch a new <BR>connecting detail.  The Irish music adds a wonderful flavor, and the entire film has a romantic feel reminiscent of the Sicilian scenes in Godfather II.  The more I watch it, the more I like it.

B000002JNJ|5.0|When Pantera released Cowboys From Hell, they started a trend that would eventually destroy grunge. Every Pantera album released has been worthy enough to buy and listen. Cowboys From Hell is one of those albums that you can listen to start to finish. With hard-hitting songs like &quot;Domination&quot; andthe title track will just blow you away, but then &quot;Cemetary Gates&quot; is guitarists Dimebag Darrell's best acoustic song. On the song &quot;Shattered&quot; singer Phil Anselmo's singing reaches a Rob Halford level. Vinnie Paul's double-bass drums are what kicked off the 90s with intense arena drumming. Overall this is one of the great hard rock bands of the decade and this record is their landmark. The follow-up is at the same if not higher llevel. This album is a must in any cd collection
0066214122|4.0|First off, I'm a die-hard Michael Crichton fan...absolutely LOVE his stuff...however -- 'Prey' is definitely a 'formula' novel...most notably a Crichton formula novel which borrow extensively from previous works like 'Jurassic Park' & 'Timeline'.  If you have read many of his other novels, this formula will become immediately apparent: Big corporation is messing with technology they don't fully understand nor appreciate, and in the process unleash something baaaad.  First it was the Dinosaurs when InGen toyed around with genetic manipulation where they shouldn't have...next we have a very similar company in 'Timeline' that wanted to send the elite on once-in-a-lifetime trips through time, using science again that was a bit beyond our control and now we have nanotechnology in 'Prey' that provides a frightening look at what *could* happen should this kind of near-future science fall into the hands of those who attempt to use it for all the wrong reasons.<br />Just because Crichton is using his 'formula' here, that doesn't mean he doesn't provide us with some great cliff-hangers and genuine surprises along the way...his writing talent is far too refined to have forgotten how to pull a few strings with the readers.  'Prey' begins with poor Jack, a reluctant house-husband with a wife who has quickly become one of the powerhouse leaders at Xymos (you guessed it, the 'big corporation' that funds experiments that go horribly wrong).  Her sudden and suspiciously odd actions make Jack begin to suspect that she (Julia) just might be having an affair.  He pushes this thought away every time more and more evidence begins to mount that this is no longer a theory and more likely a fact.  Her behavior seems erratic (at best), distant with him and the children and she tells small (but significant) lies which unravel the fabric of their relationship.  All this is shockingly interrupted when Julia is involved in an accident which sends her to the hospital.  Meanwhile an incredibly un-expected invitation by his former boss (who fired him under trumped up charges) is offered to Jack asking him to come back (sort of) to help Xymos figure out how to solve a problem with a program that Jack's technical team had designed some time before.  At first Jack is totally against going back under ANY circumstances...but as the problem with Julia becomes more of an immediate concern, he figures that maybe he could find out more about her supposed affair by accepting the offer.<br />This is where the rubber hits the pavement, so-to-speak.  This is where Jack becomes immersed in the world of nanoswarms, produced by Xymos for the Military to spy on the enemy.  As in all of Crichton's novels, nothing is as it seems, and the people who give the tours of the production facility know a lot more than they are letting on (always to the suspicion of those on the receiving end of the tour).  Jack has reason to believe Ricky (the tour-guide) is holding back crucial information on the little problem they have come up against.  It appears that the company has made a once-in-a-lifetime scientific breakthrough which has allowed them to begin full production of machines on the molecular level.  Millions of microscopic machines were accidentally vented to the Nevada environment and have a peculiar problem:  they won't come back...they seem to be multiplying on their own (which they just shouldn't be able to do)...they seem to be killing desert animals...oh, and they were programmed using a predator/prey program that Jack and his former team-mates created.  Just about everything that Ricky says turns out to be half-truths or outright lies from pretty much the beginning.  Jack almost immediately has a plan that nobody had previously thought about which will eliminate the nanoswarms...but if you know the typical Michael Crichton novel, you know that first, and even second plans usually go horribly wrong.  What exactly is Ricky hiding from Jack and just about everyone else?  How are the nanoswarms able to multiply?  How are they developing behavior that their programming says should be 100% impossible?  How is Jack's wife, Julia embroiled in all of this, and is she really having an affair?  And the biggest question of all: Can the nanoswarms be stopped...and if so, how?<br />Good questions and for the sheer fun of the story I gave 'Prey' 5 stars, but for re-telling a story told before in 'Jurassic Park' and 'Timeline' I give it just 4 stars.  Perfectly enjoyable even despite my reservations and I very much look forward to the future movie at the local cineplex, it ought to be a real nail-biter.e the nanoswarms able to multiply?

0783226063|3.0|I like the book alot . And I like this movie. David Lynch is one of my favorite living directors. Read the other reviews and you get the typical gamut of responses. I disagree with the hardcore fans of the book. There just aren't enough good sci-fi and fantasy films. Maybe this movie simply fills that vacuum and maybe not. I think not. I think it's a fine movie.  I enjoyed it in the theaters when it was originally released. I finally watched it again last year, after 15 years. I was surprised by how much I liked it. I watched it over and over again.  My only complaint (the reason I give this three stars) is that it could be even better: RELEASE A DIRECTOR'S CUT ALREADY!!!!!!! Make it six hours long or whatever it takes. PLEASE DAVID!!! PLEASE!!! DO IT FOR YOUR FANS. Perhaps my expectations are too high but I sense that the original cut of this, at four hours long or whatever it was, was better than all of the original Star Wars trilogy put together.
0783226063|5.0|This is movie is freaking crazy!!! I love it even though I know it isn't all that good.   Now I know it is harsh and that this movie has taken its fair share of [criticism] from scifi buffs over the years, HOWEVER thats because that in so many ways the movie doesn't attempt to follow the book <br />I mean its not a bad movie and it could have been so much better had they tried a little harder.  <br />My personal favorite part is in the beginning when Frank Herbert himself is narrating, that part was great.  This way we know what the hell is going on of we have never read the books before(something incredibly rare in movies) <br />Also I would like to add that for as much [criticism] as he got for acting STING did a great job.  <br />For example <br />As for those parts that they could have erased and it would have been a lot better <BR>Heart Plugs?<BR>The Stupid New Weapons? <BR>An Army using sound as a weapon?<BR>And the one word that ticked me off the most SHHHHAAA!!  I mean are any of us onvinced by this even for a second?(although I have to say the part with the Fermen riding in on the Sand Worms was very cool)  <br />Overall-OK movie doesn't deserve to be totally trashed
B000001ESF|5.0|Hello,<br />I view this as Rush's greatest album. The whole story is simply amazing and will truly grasp you. Neil Peart is an amazing drummer as well as a lyricist. Geddy Lee's vocals and bass are amazing as well, and Alex Lifeson's lead guitar work surely puts Jimmy Page to shame. I truly don't think there is anything wrong with this album. If you're new to Rush and would like to get into their music, than pick this studio album up or one of their three greatest hits packages which include: Chronicles, Retrospective I, and Retrospective II. <br />I also see 2112 on the same terms as the Who's magnum opus Tommy and Lifehouse(Who's Next), which doesn't surprise me since Alex and Geddy were Who fans. And if you check out Rush's homepage Geddy says that if they ever did a cover of song from another band it would be something by the Who. (Yes, the Who are my favorite band, with Rush coming in at number 2!) <br />Rush are one of the greatest bands of all time and should be listened to. 2112 is great, but I still prefer their 1977 album &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot;. All their concept albums are great. <br />Please, check this band out.

The drawings are very well done and the story is charming and care free - my son knows all the words without reading.

I just ordered two more of the series for Christmas presents.  A great book!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Japanese anime has a never-ending ability to surprise and refresh my concepts of that is possible in an 'artificial' format.  Perhaps this is merely due to my status as a rank amateur, but I seem to get more excited by this format than I have by any other in some time.  There is something in anime that reaches past the traditional limits of modern illustrative animation<br />For example, take 'Princess Mononoke.'  On the surface, this is not a complicated film.  Prince Ashitaka receives an evil wound while defending his village from a forest wild boar god that has been driven insane by poisoned bullet.  The village wise woman tells Ashitaka that he is doomed to death, and sends him on a quest to the home of the ruined deity, where his task is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hatred.'  And so, Ashitaka comes to Irontown where the need for resources has put the town in conflict with the natural world about them.<br />The beautiful Lady Eboshi leads the town on a perpetual assault against the forest.  There, with the aid of Jigo, the Emperor's representative, she plans to kill the forest spirit and give its head to the Emperor.  Opposing her is the wolf girl San, Princess Mononoke.  San and her wolves are fighting a losing battle to stop Eboshi and her villagers.  She has renounced her fellow humans and seeks to kill all who endanger the forest.  Into the middle of this steps Ashitaka, who tries to help both sides to survive, and receives few thanks for his concern.<br />Too often, this type of plot would invite a great deal of overacting and bombastic dialogue.  Yet that is exactly what does not happen in Hiyao Miyuzaki's delivery of this tale.  The viewer will come to love the villagers and can at least admire Lady Eboshi for her fierce determination and care for her own.  Jigo is driven by greed, but he is hardly unwise, and knows how to bend with circumstances.  Mononoke is angry, fiercely bloodthirsty as well as beautifully and tragically heroic.  Only Ashitaka is all of one color, despite a wound that threatens to turn him into a demon.<br />Instead of being a pretty film with a message, Miyazaki has created a film with many levels.  He turns his eye to many conflicts that have no clear resolution and allows them to retain the dignity of their context.  Thus, an animated film becomes more real than reality, where even the tragedy of change can become life affirming.  The naturalness of the translation and dubbing (carried out under the watchful eye of Neil Gaiman) will also surprise those of us who are used to having to watch the sub-titles to get a true sense of what is being said.<br />This film is extremely worthwhile, and watchable by any audience that can manage the unavoidable violence.  One that will stay in mind for some time to come, and that I will mention when someone asks me what I would recommend as an introduction to the complex world of anime.ll of one color, despite a wound that threatens to turn him into a demon.<br />Instead of being a pretty film with a message, Miyazaki has created a film with many levels.

B000066NW0|5.0|It seems to me that there's two general opinion of Avril Lavigne: a current and future musical genius or an over-merchandised, over-exposed, manufactured MTV blueprint. For those people that opinions are of the latter, you're wrong. I don't know if it's just me, but there is nothing Britney-ish about Avril. I think people are taking this whole &quot;she's not punk&quot; thing a little too seriously. Who cares? Remember Linkin Park? They're a mix of everything and it worked. Better yet, does the phrase &quot;Walk This Way&quot; ring a bell? A combination of different genres aren't that uncommon nowadays.<br />&quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; are the two hits off of this CD, but I found &quot;Things I'll Never Say,&quot; &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Losing Grip&quot; a bit more refreshing. &quot;I'm With You&quot; the third single from this cd is also a nice song to listen to. As far as I'm concerned, this is one of those CDs you keep in your car's CD player and listen through the entire thing instead of skipping from one good song to the other.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I am not a teeny bopper nor am I an old kodger, and I love John Mayer.  I agree completely with a previous review, that it is about time we get a cd from an artist who is truly an artist.  One who writes and plays his own music and his own lyrics.  I have found myself listening over and over to this cd, especially when I am on the treadmill at the gym :)  Being a single in this crazy world, I find myself relating to all of these songs in a deep way.  Dig below your superficiality and you too, may be touched by this man's incredible heartfelt talent.
B00000JMQE|3.0|Disney has owned the film rights to L. Frank Baum's sequels to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; for decades, and actually started preproduction on &quot;The Rainbow Road To Oz&quot; back in the '50s.  That film never got made, and Disney shelved the Oz books until the '80s when it released this film.  &quot;Return to Oz&quot; is based mostly on the second and third books in the series--the basic plot coming from &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (which is the story of Dorothy and Ozma rescuing the royal family of a neighboring kingdom, who have been turned into ornaments by the Nome King), with additional characters and episodes from &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (which is about an all-girl army overthrowing The Emerald City, and had already been loosely adapted as &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot;) added in, along with some original material.  The new material is the weakest part of the movie--I don't think Baum would have sent Dorothy for shock therapy--but Disney does well by some Baum characters and scenes, especially the Wheelers, the Gump, Tik-Tok, and Princess Mombi (actually a combination of two characters) with the detachable heads.  The Nome King was a big disappointment, though.  In the books, he's a fat, little troll (as a Nome or Gnome should be), but Disney decided to use the latest in computer animation, turning the Nome King into a talking rock-formation; they'd have done better to go with the original model.  He's less a character here than a special effect, and an oportunity to present Baum's humor which is totally lacking here was missed.  Fairuza Balk, however, is a revelation as Dorothy.  No, she's no Judy Garland, nor does she try to be.  She gives a faithful interpretation of Dorothy as written by Baum, and she is the glue that holds this picture together.  And, like Garland, she has a little magical spark in her that comes across on film.  Altogether not a bad movie, but Baum's wonderful books deserve better than this.  With a new Oz movie and a TV series which each present different/modern views of Oz on the way, it's a shame nobody will simply film the stories from the books.  MGM did it, and look what a success they had!
B000002UAX|2.0|One of the traits that attracts me to an album is the ability to listen to it from start to finish without skipping a track. If after doing so, the album has told a story, set a stage, or communicated a theme, all the better.  It is in the vein that albums such as Abbey Road (Beatles), Layla (Clapton), and Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) stand out, and it is the same reason why The White Album falls short.<br />A subset of this music could have been an awesome album if released on a single disk with some continuity. There are tracks that are great here, and that set the stage for what the Beatles were going through at the time, including Dear Prudence, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, I'm So Tired, and Revolution.  Additionally, tracks like USSR and Birthday could have given such an album a little levity.<br />Instead, beginning with Sgt. Pepper, the Lennon &amp; McCartney songwriting team no longer existed, and the Beatles served up either Lennon songs, McCartney songs, or the spliced together fare of George Martin like &quot;A Day In the Life&quot;. While such production made the success of the second side of Abbey Road (splicing together incomplete songs of Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, etc.) it was absent on the White Album.  Instead the album is filled with the incompleteness of Wild Honey Pie, and the sub-par Why Don't We Do It In the Road, Long Long Long, etc.<br />This makes for an album that is tough to listen to without skipping tracks, so it's tough to call it one of the best. Frankly I think of it as more of a landfill for built up Beatles material that needed to be dumped somewhere. <br />Ten good songs out of 30 = 2 stars, but BUY it for the ten gems.

There is really only one thing that bothers me about this CD and that is the &quot;muscle&quot;  or should I say greed behind it.<br />Courtney Love,her own band is something that was all but forgotten about shortly after the release of &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; and her acting career was better left to the talented professionals in Hollywood, so what is a &quot;woman&quot; to do?  Oh yeah, take her dead husband's fabulous work and sell it to make millions.  Not only has she exploited his music but she also decided to sell his journals, his PRIVATE JOURNALS, to the tune of four million dollars. Some things should be better left unknow.  I sure hope that Kurt is rolling over in his grave.
0618002243|5.0|The Return of the King is one of the best novels I have ever read.  This novel is so intense I could feel heart pounding.  At the end of book five, where Tolkien returns to Sam and Frodo's journey, I could not put the book down.  I read the remainder of the novel that day.  Suspense keeps building and building until the very end.  I actually find the ending to be sad.  The final pages and parts and appendix seem very sad to me.  I think the appedix is well worth reading.<br />The story of Gandalf and Pippen sets the stage for the battle before Minas Tirith.  The Witch King of Angmar leads his forces to destroy the White City while the men of Umbar sail against the Pelagir.  When all seems hopeless, the Riders of Rohan arrive, and Aragorn walks the Path of the Dead.  Sam and Frodo travel through Mordor even as the last battle is nearing its beginning.  The Nazgul fly from battle as the ring nears its destruction.  Will Frodo and Sam finish their quest?  The suspense is staggering.  <br />The Return of the King is amazing, but if you wish to learn more of Middle Earth, of Beren and Luthien, and of Feanor, read not only the Return of the King, but the Silmarillion as well.
0394800184|5.0|Growing up (all those decades ago), this was one of our family's favorite bedtime reads. We'd giggle with anticipation as Mom drew closer to the \\"You are not my mother, you are a snort!\\" page then burst into fits of laughter (hey, this was before cable). As a published children's author, I can honestly say that \\"Are You My Mother?\\" was one of the core books that inspired me to try my hand at this noble profession. The best part is now I get to read it to my three girls and they love it too. Guaranteed kid pleaser.
0312979479|5.0|I enjoyed reading this great mystery-murder novel by Agatha Christie. She keeps you in suspense through out the whole book and makes you want to keep reading on. I recommend it to everyone, as long as they can read, even if they do not enjoy mystery novels.
0060523794|4.0|As an IBMer who joined in the mid-1990s, I enjoyed the book as a light read and an accurate account of the cultural transformation which has touched all of us insiders in some fashion or other. I found particularly entertaining a short \\"IBM lingo\\" section, with many sayings that I had assumed were part of the everyday business vocabulary.<br />However, I would have liked more depth and detail throughout Mr. Gerstner's account.  Overall the book feels a bit light in many areas, with few references to anecdotes, actual examples, and names of actual people (other than the few who are praised). As a result, the narrative does feel a bit detached and fails to grab the reader emotionally... You can't really feel the \\"passion\\" and the \\"struggle\\" that must have permeated Mr. Gerstner's day-to-day life as he was moving to transform the company. <br />I would recommend the book, particularly since it can be easily digested over a couple of weekends and makes for an interesting and entertaining read.
0066214122|5.0|Enjoyable piece of entertainment. I haven't read any of his other books but after this one I'm sure that I will. Worth the money. Also recommend Evolution by Jennifer MacDonald. It's a stream of consciouness story that I found intriguing and a very unique read, again it was worth the money I spent on it.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|The first time I saw the film I said... FANTASTIC THRILLER! The second time I saw the film I said... I HAVE TO OWN IT!!! This is an excellent film to have and to watch over and over again. Bring your Sticky Notes (you just might need them). An extra treat is the cameo appearance by Irish-born actor, Larry Holden, in the role of Jimmy Grantz. Also, the film's director, Chris Nolan, put some hidden features on the Limited Edition DVD (My lips are sealed). The film's official site is also a MUST see. HINT: Just look for momento in the mirror and you will find it.
6305428522|5.0|This is a great film on so many levels...dialogue, performances, cinematography, editing...all supporting the central metaphor of the quiz show scandals as a watershed event, marking the loss of innocence and shattering societal changes that began in the 1950s and are still playing out today.<br />Along the way, many subtle symbols are interjected which support this thesis, and it is these elements that raise the movie to the same level as some of the best films ever made.<br />Here's my favotite example; one that most people probably didn't notice:  In the opening credits, we hear the bouncy 1950s hit-single version of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;.  Then, over the closing credits we hear the much darker 1970s version of the same song (which is actually a truer translation of the Weill &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; classic). Thus, these two &quot;bookends&quot; symbolize the loss of innocence and change of mood that take place during the course of the film's events.   <br />What an amazing element, yet so inconspicuous that it passes largely undetected.  &quot;Quiz Show&quot; is packed with these...making multiple viewings a highly rewarding experience.  Essential.
B00005JL2O|2.0|This movie is just not as funny as the first two. In addition, somehow number 2 is back, even though he died in the first movie. Austin Powers's father has a hatred for Dutch people that the movie doesn't explain. There is an attempt to get as many actors in this movie as possible. I regret not seeing this movie in the theater because I would not have bought it.
B00005JKZ3|4.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is back, and this time with a dog with even more attitude than before. But the the best actor has to be the computer graphics. Computer graphics is what they are: Computer graphics. But you don't necessarily call them only that if they do certain things to you:A: Frighten you. B: Make you laugh. C: Serve as something the guys who made the movie couldn't do any better. Because I am not, D: Impressed by computer graphics anymore.<br />But hey, this movie manages to be funny. Several scenes from the movie are quite cool, and just when I thought that &quot;Who lets the dog out&quot; song had gone out of style... It's exactly as short as it should be, it has a certain blue note on both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones's part to give the story a boost, but hey, it's Men in Black. <BR>Recommended comedy.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has the most soothing, peaceful, calming and alluring female voice I have ever heard, period. She is in a category all her own. What a captivating voice she has. I am addicted to it.<BR> <BR>If she and her people select and write the right songs for her (namely GREAT songs)...then she is destined to become a legend. I think it has been perhaps over a decade since an artist with this much pure talent has come along with the ability to easily be listened to 100 years from now. Do you honestly think that people will be listening to Britney Spears, the grunge stuff out now, the rap, etc. in 100 years? Not likely. Dave Matthews, perhaps. Norah Jones, definitely.
B00001PE4D|5.0|A brilliant film unfortunately hyped as a simple teen-flick, Cruel Intention is enjoyably dark as it focuses on the world of teenagers with the world at their fingertips, or in other words, the freedom to amuse themselves selfishly to the misfortune of their victims. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Kathryn) and Ryan Phillippe (Sebastian) are great to watch in their naughty schemes and sinister acts. Reese Witherspoon (Annette) steals the film with her portrayal of the innocent victim whom prevails in the end. The most entertaining however is by far Selma Blair (Cecile) with convincing, hilarious ignorance and foolishness. The charisma between Phillippe and Witherspoon is excellent, considering the real life situation at the time of production and following it most certainly should be. Glorious film, worth the commitment.
B000002HAF|5.0|If anyone has read my other reviews you will know that I have a habit of hating an album the first time I listen to it, but not this one!!! This is a great album, from the first to the last songs. A little surprise for any Bowie fans out there, David covers the song cactus on his latest album Heathen. Each song is very spirited. With all the new bands out there this blows them all away, and the cd is 14 years old now. So while the \\"yeah, yeah, yeahs\\", \\"The Donna's\\", The Strokes\\", \\"THe Vines\\" etc are all getting the press this is the cd that you should be listening to.
0345428064|5.0|After reading a fair number of thrillers, you can tell when someone is writing from knowledge and experience without even knowing anything about the author.  Andy McNab has learned much from being in the SAS, and it shows-- Stone is one of the most cunning and believable characters in thriller fiction.  I got the same feeling of excitement reading this book as I did when I first read Alistair McLean's early novels.  Highly recommended.
B00006LSM3|4.0|There's a note from another reviewer to \\"avoid 'Brainwashed'\\" because of the post-production work of Jeff Lynne.  Please give this music a chance regardless.<br />Much has been written here and elsewhere about the work Jeff Lynne did in completing George Harrison's final recordings.  When I first spun this disc, I had something of a disappointed reaction to what were clearly Lynne elements to the final production.<br />But it's a couple weeks now...and having listened to this music often, the lovely quality of George's final recordings shines through whatever mis-steps that Lynne committed.<br />From the wicked opening guitar solo of \\"Any Road\\", the plaintive refrain of \\"Looking For My Life\\", the haunting glide of \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" and especially the gorgeous \\"Never Get Over You\\" (that features the most wailing and sweet guitar work of the artist), this is a CD that deserves your attention.<br />Many don't care for the production style of Jeff Lynne.  Certainly there are a few things Harrison would NOT have done (the string section in \\"Rising Sun\\" for example), but I think, upon further listenings, that Jeff was respectful of the work and didn't insert himself too much into it. I think the worst thing I can say is that Jeff tried too hard to fill in more blanks than was necessary, to take these demo-type recordings into a more commercial presentation - but he followed his work habits, and it's hard to completely fault his choices, only his execution. Like - he put a bit too much pepper in the stew...<br />Given that Harrison's family felt that this was the best way to present George's final recordings to the public, this is all we're going to be able to get.  And the music, the songs, the voice and the wonderful guitar is hardly buried in any sort of post-production.  If you enjoy the music of George Harrison, you will find much to enjoy here, and it's worth a place on your shelf.<br />Please...do NOT avoid this CD.
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is a unique and brilliant contribution to music.  The album starts off at an ambitious level of quality, and, amazingly, jacks it up a notch, and sustains that quality almost without interruption through to the end.<br />All the ingredients are here.  The melodies are clear and interesting; the harmonies are complex and effective; the performance is top-notch.  In an era when so many bands get by (and even achieve huge success) with sloppy guitar work, murky drums, simplistic arrangements, and poor melodies, the Smashing Pumpkins are (or were) a heaven-sent balm.  Here is a band which not only knows exactly which notes it wants to play, but hits every one perfectly.  Every part of every song fits, and the performance is flawless.<br />Individually great songs, however, are only half of a great album -- the other half is how the songs flow together.  Here again Mellon Collie tops the heap.  The songs are mind-bogglingly diverse, yet each follows from the next organically, each transition seems natural.  Thematic elements and brief motifs recur throughout the album, never seeming forced, but always naturally arising from the music.<br />With great songs that fit well together, we have a great album, but Mellon Collie goes even beyond that in its truly astonishing diversity.  Albums with so many distinct musical styles are exceedingly rare.  No song seems to be a weak point.  This is almost impossible to believe, and it continues to amaze me each time I listen to the album.  One strong, original melody follows another, each backed by an astute and equally original arrangement.<br />This is a truly amazing album.  Even more amazing (and a bonus for the listener) is that this quality is sustained over TWO CDs -- not only do you get uncommonly superb music, you get twice as much of it as you would on a normal-sized album.<br />Sad to say, some people seem to be unable to enjoy this album, for some reason or reasons.  I cannot fathomthis.  Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is a landmark work;  I recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B000066NW0|5.0|Hey I wish People would stop saying such bad stuff about Avril! So she's a punk. So? Get over it! That's how she likes to express herself. Not everyone likes to be the same as everyone else. \\"...I'd rather be anything but ordinary please...\\" Give her a BREAK you guys! She's only 17! Probly the reason why everyone is talkin bad about her is cause she's so young and is more famous than any of us will ever be. But who cares? This is what she wants to do with her life so let her do it! If the punk thing she is doing bothers you, be patient. She'll grow out of it probly one day, but until then let her be herself. I'm not a punk or a Goth or anything but I still love her music. As a matter of fact she's my fave singer as of now! She's really good She writes all her songs and plays her own music. OK so she's not Michelle Branch (P.S. Michelle's really good too! I reccommend her CD!) and she's definitely not Britney! THank heavens she's not Britney! But she's a very talented girl! At least give her a chance, yall. I agree with whoever wrote \\"Leave Her Alone.\\" Her songs are really good! I am like hooked on her CD! My fave song is #1 Losing Grip. I love the guitars! She is so good at writing songs. Some of yall may think she's \\"immature.\\" She's 17. I mean Come ON! I love all the songs except #12 Too Much To Ask cause it's kinda slow and boring but it's still good. #4, #10, and #11 all have like one cuss word each in them and she coulda left them out but maybe that's just the way she wanted to express it. Yall should really consider buying this. I was happy with my purchase and my money was well spent! :0)<br />BTW, if you hate Avril's music so much, then don't LISTEN to it!
B00003CY6M|4.0|Like me, if you like romantic movies, this one is for you ...   especially when you love the titles like &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; (and its remake &quot;You Got a Mail&quot;).  Instead of Tom and Meg, you got John Cusack and kate Beckinsale, both of whom are really good.  But the story first.  <br />Jonathan (Cusack) and Sara (Beckinsale) meets at New York City's crowded Bloomingdale's just five days before Christmas.  Each of them, looking for a present for their own sweethearts, lay hands on the same pair of black gloves.  A lively conversation begins, which leads to joyful chatting over chocolate at the cafe &quot;Serendipity 3.&quot;  Then, knowing that they are going out with somebody else at home, Jonathan and Sara, as you know, fall in love with each other instantly.  But one proposal from Sara, who is reading Garcia Marquez's &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;, changes everything.  Perhaps she is influenced by what she read.<br />This is what she does.  Sara has Jonathan write down his phone number on a five dollar note, and without looking at it, she spends it at the nearby stand.  (Oh, I forgot to say that they didn't formally introduced themselves, so they don't know each other's surnames.)  In the same way, she writes down her name and phone number on the page of her book, and tells him that she is going to sell the book somewhere later.  Sara says; If there is fate or destiny; and if they are predestined to meet again, they will meet again.  Then she vanishes into the street of New York, leaving him behind.  <br />Cue to a few years later ... but I should stop here.  Imagine the rest of the story for yourself.  More cynical fans would think that everything is too contrived and impossible, and maybe they are right.  Some might say that it is all too predictable, and yes, they are right, perhaps.  But what is the point of watching films when you just want to see the better side of life?  Are we denied todo that simply because some people think reality of life is so hard?  Well, I disagree.<br />&quot;Serendipity&quot; is totally, absolutely, completely for the people with romantic personality, and that is all you have to know.  The two leads' parts are underwritten, and it seems sometimes that some part of the film are missing from the complete version, but John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are so charming that all those faults are forgiven.  The supporting roles are weak, so you cannot expect delightful comic moments too mcuh, but at least Eugene Levy as a most annoying clerk and Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's friend are recommended.  The photography is also great, capturing the best side of Manhattan.  Yes, this is another post-card New York, but still I loved the beauty of the film.<br />The healthy commercial success on US box-office chart means many of us love these romantic films.  You can say there is no such thing like serendipity ... but how can you prove it?  For those who believe in it, &quot;Serendipity&quot; would be an unalloyed, precious treasure.
B0000033TE|4.0|Well it's a pity for the excessive bombastic experimentations and technological effects of \\"Toccata\\" too; I'm a bit sorry for the long duration of the excellent suite Karn Evil 9, which is becoming more and more prolix after several listenings, expecially the second part...anyway the rest is enriched with some interesting solos taken from Ginastera and the beautiful epic theme of Jerusalem as well, another adaptation,arranged in a remarkable way!! \\"Still ... you turn me on\\" is a typical ballad according to G. Lake's romantic style ; instead \\"Benny the bouncer\\" is a classic jazz arrangement by Emerson, where Carl Palmer can show his ability at his jazzy drumming, reminding us of the exceptional work by Buddy Rich, his tutor and great friend too, with the B.R. Orchestra ...<br />Highly recommended!! But before this, listen to the incomparable \\"Pictures at an exhibition\\", their famous adaptation from Mussorgsky
6301790170|4.0|Forget the fact that this film was one of the biggest commercial and critical bombs in the history of cinema, as it has achieved cult status (just look at all the positive reviews on this website), with the likes of Stephen King and Harlan Ellison expressing their admiration for it.  Why the studio has decided to release a shoddy version on DVD is beyond me-- perhaps Friedkin's personality (not unlike that of James Cameron) has made him too many enemies.  Nevertheless, this is a gritty grimy film with some outstanding sequences that could never be equalled by computer generated imagery (the suspension bridge crossing is definitely one of the most suspenseful scenes in all of cinema) and a truly stand-out score by Tangerine Dream (which turned me into a life-long fan of the group).  Performances and editing are superb, though the film does have its rough edges (some awkward camerawork, too-obvious details like the bride with the black eye).  Still, it is a memorable viewing experience.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore.<BR>Trivia footnote: Friedkin put a portrait of Charles Bludhorn, chairman of Gulf + Western (parent company of Paramount) on the wall of the oil company.  G+W had many investments in South America, and Bludhorn was not pleased (to say the least) when he saw his picture in the film.
0316666343|1.0|This book goes from decent to bad to horrible.  The ending is one of the most contrived I've ever read.  The language is convoluted and lacks any grace, the characters are unbelievable and there are a number of story threads that fray throughout.  Save yourself some time and money and read something else.
0385508417|1.0|There was hardly anything that I liked about this book. All the characters are annoying, predictable and NOT FUNNY.<br />I particularly disliked the racist references about Enrique (Blair's boyfriend from Peru).<br />Most of all the story is booooring and simplistic.<br />Do not waste your time.
B000075BFK|5.0|...simple to explain, another great tupac album, every song just about worth listening too, not as good or even close to all eyez on me,yet better than r u still down &amp;untill the end of time<BR>highly reccommended for all pac fans...<br />one
0553382179|5.0|This book is for anyone who grew up having to cleaning house every Saturday and/or feels overwhelmed by keeping house.  The Flylady shows how to start with baby steps and FLY your way to an organized house that you are proud to have anyone see.  If you are living in CHAOS (Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome), this book is for you.  Fair warning though--no whining allowed.
B00000AD94|4.0|Well the fantastic INTRO was a promise, but soon there was a controversial question, because some derivative moments Genesis-like and the forced ones in the vein of modern rock style,created some question marks, above all if We make a comparison with another US band- Echolyn - of &quot;Suffocating the Bloom&quot;, performing a great album in the same period!! But the best instrumental breakthrough it's well worth checking out ... if They were less prolix (listen to the last mini-suite &quot;The water/the edge)this album could have been put among the best 20 prog albums ever...instead.<br />Recommended!! But before this listen to &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;
B00007E8V4|5.0|In one word.. AWSOME. SOAD has done it again.. bravo..
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I can still remember the first time I ever saw a commercial for Beauty and the Beast, while watchign my afternoon cartoons. Immediatly I was hooked. I hadn't even seen the movie! After much whining, groaning, and anticipation, I was taken to the theatre on its opening day. I can't remember ever being as enthralled before or since! I saw it 7 time sin theatre, and have watched the video dozens more times. This DVD has recaptured that magic so a whole new generation of children can enjoy it.  The DVD has three versions of the film all of which are a joy to watch. I was so happy that they included the original film version, and not just the new version. Theres somethign comfortable in familiarity. there is also a work on progress which is just fascinating. It really helps one understand the whole process. There are alos hours of bonus feautures, most of which I haven't had time to even watch yet. there is also a game that has entertained my younger siblings for hours on end. This DVD is a true Gen that brings Beauty and the Beast to life in sharper and more vivid color then ever! Don't wait buy now!
B00006LJ72|5.0|This box set is certainly designed for the fans of Enya - people who have heard the songs time and time again and now wants to reach deeper into the song. It is not recommended for Enya-haters who claim that they hate and still listen to the discs in the box set. The box itself is beautiful in its design and the mock velvet gives it an elegant touch. The colour booklet is brilliant and its contents make it a must read. The sound quality for certain songs seems improved, especially for the older tracks. While other rare tracks and equally beautiful songs are not included (which is a waste), it still possesses many of the finest tracks available. Not all the songs are as catchy as Orinoco Flow or majestic as Book Of Days. Yet, many of the slow songs would eventually sound splendid upon repeated listenings. The bonus multimedia isn't particularly fantastic but it is still wonderful. This includes a gallery and screensaver as well. The price makes it a bargain as well for 4 discs and 50 songs. If you are not one who can listen to Enya for a long time, listen to one disc at a time. No one asked you to listen to 4 discs at one go.
B00007E8V4|1.0|Only thing that really stinks about SOAD is that they have had 3 or 4 cds and they still sound the same. Having one CD pretty much means you have them all. <br />Song 1 - Little drum beat into the same heavy guitar riff. Afterwards, lower the tone into a snare 400 times, play a bass riff and sing very annoying like. <BR>Play a heavy chorus and repeat.<br />Song 2 - See song 1.<BR>Song 3 - See song 1. <br />Then they will have a song they tried to make sound different, but usually dosent make up for all the other songs on the cd. <br />System of a Down is a overrated, medium talented band. MTV, with the help of Carson Daily once again made another Korn band that everyone will think is cool because \\"MTV knows what is awesome\\".
B000002UAI|4.0|\\"Beatles For Sale\\" is often criticized, and probably rightfully so, for not being as good as \\"Hard Day's Night.\\"  Well, these guys had produced a hit record or original music, starred in a feature film, toured the world and been hounded by screaming fans.  You would have been a little burned out, too.<br />For Sale was also released around the same time as the single \\"I Feel Fine/She's a Woman\\" so the energy is still there.<br />With all the touring and hands on their time, The Beatles reached into their bag of covers on \\"For Sale\\" and many of these outshine the original Lennon/McCartney tunes here.  The performances remain professional and the energy pulls the listener through the entire disk.  Still, John Lennon remained in a very productive mode and his voice was in fine form.<br />\\"No Reply\\" moves from the puppy dog romance to a jealous lover dealing with a two-timing girlfriend.  There's a nice, strummy rhythm and harmony vocals.  Grade:  B-<br />\\"I'm a Loser\\" is a more complex love song, with Lennon displaying different emotions in his lyrics.  There is regret over losing the special woman.  I like Lennon's vocal performance and there are some nice lyrical couplets.  We also have a countryish feel, some nice guitar work by George and harmonica by John.  Vince Guaraldi of Charlie Brown jazz piano fame once covered this tune.  Grade: A-<br />\\"Baby's in Black\\" is a girl-jilted tune, and the twangy guitar line doesn't quite work for me.  The harmonies are nice but the song is just average.  Grade:  C<br />\\"Rock and Roll Music\\" is a Chuck Berry tune sung by John Lennon with great energy that I think improves on the original.  This is a classic college dance song.  Nice chord changes and cool boogie-woogie piano lines.  Super R&B.  Grade:  A<br />\\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" is a folkier acoustic number with Paul on lead vocals.  I like the simple lyric \\"but tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.\\"  The harmonies are more interesting here than many of the tunes on For Sale.  Grade:  A-<br />\\"Mr. Moonlight,\\" another cover,is often reviled as one of the worst Beatle covers ever, but it's delightfully cheesy in the vein of \\"A Taste of Honey\\" or \\"Besame Mucho.\\"  Lennon and the boys sing their hearts out.  Check out the organ solo.  This is a tune that parents of Beatlemaniacs back in the day could like.  I once saw a Japanese Beatle's cover band perform this tune.  Hilarious.  Grade:  C+<br />The \\"Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey\\" medley is a double-cover, another classic college R&B dance tune, with call and response lyrics and the aura of smoky basement bars.  Grade:  B<br />\\"Eight Days a Week\\" is the gem of the record.  The cool guitar intro, nice melodic roll, \\"hold me, love me\\" lyric and a phrase coined into the vernacular.  It's a puppy dog love song, but Lennon is back to his cheeful exuberance here.  Grade:  A<br />\\"Words of Love\\" is a dead-on cover of a Buddy Holly tune with nice guitar lines by George. Except, in this case, the original is better than this version.  Grade:  B<br />\\"Honey Don't\\" is a Carl Perkins rockabilly tune, and Ringo's vocal contribution to the album. I like the guitar lines, the stop and start rhythm, and the chord tricks.  Grade:  B<br />\\"Every Little Thing\\" is an overlooked nugget of a love song.  Not Lennon's best lead performance and lacking some energy, but a nice melody and harmony.  Cool low drum roll by Ringo and good guitar work by George.  Check out the cover version by Yes on YesYears.  Grade:  B-<br />\\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\\" is another countryish, twangy tune with nice harmonies but otherwise forgettable lyrics.  Grade:  C+<br />When you hear \\"What You're Doing\\" the first thing that comes to mind is The Byrds.  That shimmering twelve-string Rickenbacker inspired Roger McGuinn and a thousand imitators.  While I like the instruments and Ringo's drum rolls, I don't care for the vocal melody and Paul's vocal in particular is kind of irritating.  Grade:  C<br />The finale is another CarlPerkins' tune \\"Everybody's Trying to be my Baby,\\" sung by George.  You can only imagine him smirking while singing, \\"took some honey, from a tree, dressed it up and called it me.\\"  This is a great rockabilly classic, with excellent guitar work by George.  Grade:  B+Perkins' tune \\"Everybody's Trying to be my Baby,\\" sung by George.  You can only imagine him smirking while singing, \\"took some honey, from a tree, dressed it up and called it me.\\"  This is a great rockabilly classic, with excellent guitar work by George.  Grade:  B+
B000068PQ0|4.0|I've been a flaming lips fan for years.  Their sound has consistently evolved with each album, and Yoshimi is no exception.  Imagine, if you will, Telepathic Surgery melodies set to Casiotone electronic keyboard beats, with some rump-kicking real drums thrown in here and there, and FL's characteristicly weird &quot;story-lyrics&quot; and funky guitar, and that almost sums up Yoshimi.  If you're already a Lips fan, Yoshimi will probably not disappoint you.  If you're not- try one of their earlier albums first because, although this is a good album, it is better when taken in the contex of their larger body of work.
0553296981|5.0|The Diary of a young girl was a great  story .  The setting of  the story was in Germany from 1942 to 1944 during World War II.  Three main characters in the book were Otto, Margot , and  Miss Van . My favorite character was Anne Frank because she was a  innocent girl who was one of the millions of victims of Hitler . Hitler killed almost all the Jews in Europe. My favorite part of the book when  Anne was talking with her  friends and how  Anne named them.  I recommend  this  book to everyone kids and adults because it' s very , very  interesting . You  can learn about  Anne how she lived and how she suffered.
B00003Q43A|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent action and special effects.  Good strong imagery.<br />*Good film style and good production design.<br />*Storyline is engaging, filled with lots of drama and comedy.<br />*Very accurate to White House politics and military strategem.<br />*Lots of good characters.<br />*Lots of memorable lines.<br />*Okay music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little cheesy and cliched.<br /><br />This is one of the most entertaining blockbusters ever made.  It has loads of excitement, action, and special effects.  And it even has room for comedy, drama, and interesting ideas.  It's not a particuarly deep movie, but it's a lot of fun.
B000050XEI|5.0|I totally enjoy this album... Lots of English Lyrics to be able to learn and I also love the music itself. My daughter loves every song she has ever written. She is only 7 years old(by the way) We love every piece of her albums she has out so far. So far the only one we don't have is the one about Silent Night. We hope to find it in a store eventually.
0060278234|3.0|Admittedly, Lirael is a wonderful book.  However, I found the plotline flawed and somehow unsatisfying.  Sabriel was full of action.  Sabriel, Mogget, and Touchstone DID things.  They actually accomplished ends, made events happen.  Nothing like that was in Lirael.  So Lirael finally figures out who she is, after a lot [] killing and bad things.  Big deal!  It was a nice idea, to work so hard to set up Abhorsen, but to waste all that time...<BR>Also, I was totally upset over Lirael being the Abhorsen-in-Waiting.  What about Sam?  I really liked him, and plus he felt like another Lirael--completely cast out and different.  Never destined to be King, never destined to be Abhorsen.  WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM?  I mean, Lirael is already the Remembrancer or whatever... Nix seems to be treating Sam like a nuisance character, one he created on a whim with no real purpose, save to disappoint the reader and the other characters.<BR>About the characters... Where the heck was the amazing character developement from Sabriel?  You really, despite the length of the book, do not get to know Lirael.  I never connected with her.  Never.  Though I found myself liking Sam immensely, I never connected with him either.  They were both just... well... there.  Hardly any developement whatsoever.<BR>What I did like was the extension on the Old Kingdom and the Charter's past.  That was brilliant and well, magical.  I've been wondering how the Charter was formed and what keeps Free Magic alive... I guess we'll find the entire truth in Abhorsen.<BR>All in all, Lirael felt like a far too long, drawn out book with no real aim except to spend 600 pages setting up Abhorsen, when it could have been done in 300.
B0000025C0|5.0|The follow up to the bandfs legendary debut rock album in 1976 is a bit mellow and not having full instrumental tracks although gThe Journeyh make up for that loss a bit. Feel-good high-tone rock anthems like Don't Look Back and Feeling Satisfied surely extended the melodic rock genre fan base to music fans that feel for Boz Scaggs or Ambrosia. gThe Man I'll Never Beh is a ballad, which is bold attempt for rock bands, like Boston but excellently made.<br />Overall, the album is integral part of the year 1978 rock. Get it if you like Boston's latest Corporate America.
B00006JDVV|3.0|The Good Things<br />*Great concept, both in its story and the science behind it.<br />*Great special effects and action scenes.<br />*Great finale.<br />*Fairly well-developed characters, with lots of conflicts.<br />*Christian Bale is in it.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Conflict with the dragons seemed to be underplayed, and was drowned out by the conflicts between the characters.<br />*Strange, ambiguous ending.<br /><br />I generally like this film, especially with its main idea (dragons come up and destroy the planet!).  But the story seemed full of character conflicts more than physical conflicts.  It becomes dull towards the middle, but has a great beginning and a great end.  I would reccomend this to fans of post-apocalypse sci-fi, but don't expect anything overly fantastic.
B00005QG9J|1.0|this album is terrible, terrible, terrible. vaunted by teenyboppers and college kids as the future of rock, this band brings you nothing but whiny lyrics, derivative melodies, and all around sissydom. ... goooodbye incubus, nice to know you
B000023VR6|5.0|This is possibly one of the greatest rap albums to ever be released.The lyrics are hot and the collaborations are explosive.I own no other Dre albums,but this gets a lot of rotation in my c.d player!! There are not a whole lot of really good rap albums out there,but this isn't just good....it is the best!!! This is definetly a MUST OWN!!! It's hot....BUY IT!!
0066214122|4.0|Well, if I could have I would have given this book 4 and half, and I wanted to take a half away for two really shallow reasons. Although I really enjoyed this book, it's fast, can't put down reading, I really had no idea what Mr. Crichton was talking about most of the time!!!!I kept asking my husband questions concerning the science in this book, and well, that aside, I really enjoyed it. The second shallow reason I took a half away, was the ending. I wanted about 2 or 3 more pages, things wrapped a little more......but that's just me, because I normally like my endings like that. So...read this book, you will enjoy it.
B00000K0E5|5.0|This was the very first James Bond movie I ever saw.  Thus, I have grown an appreciation of the series, simply because this one was so good.<br />The action scenes are splendid.  There are many great stunts involved, including a bungee jump, and a freefall to catch a crashing airplane.<br />The story line is also enjoyable.  It is easy to understand, and has a good range of characters.  The characters themselves are well developed; the conflict between Bond and his old friend, Trevelyen, is a complex mix of love and hate.  This same love/hate theme also runs in Xenia's character, who strangles her...aquaintences...like a squid.<br />There are also numerous other characters in the film that add other elements to the story, ranging from a morbid dreariness to a lighthearted merriment.<br />The movie's style is a landmark to the Bond series.  It entails the same old elements of previous films (exotic locations, exotic women, casino scenes, etc.), but also presents new elements in its characters, action, and themes.  The movie represents the change of the world itself since the fall of the Soviet Union:  it's a completely new Bond in a completely new territory, where old enemies are friends and old friends are enemies.  There are interesting motifs of this theme, such as the statue park scene, where the relics of old Soviet statues are discarded.<br />Even the music of the film is different.  Tina Turner's title song is powerful, and Eric Serra's bizzare score is unique.<br />It's a good action film with interestingly deep political implications.  That is why I consider this to be one of my favourite Bond films (the only other rival is The World is Not Enough.  Between the two, I can never tell which is the best).
B00000JTB2|5.0|Quite simply one of the greatest blues albums available. The guitar playing is sonic alchemy from both Stevie Ray and Albert King and the sound reproduction is superb. Nothing else to say except-pass this CD up and you're a low down dirty fool!!!
B00005Q66T|4.0|I must say that despite the fact everyone considers Madonna *pop*, she is definetly not &quot;manufactured&quot; pop.That is exactly why this album is so good. This album proves that unlike most &quot;manufactured&quot; pop &quot;artists&quot;, Madonna really does have musical talent (meaning she can actually sing). These are Madonna's best songs stemming from the early 90's through 2001. The best tracks on the album are &quot;Erotica&quot;, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, &quot;Secret&quot;,and &quot;Take A Bow&quot;. Overall I would recommend this album because it really is a good album to listen to (a song for every mood). All tracks on this album are hot :-)
B00005U2JM|3.0|the first time i saw this band was when they were doing the mechanical animals tour. unfortunately manson had sprained his ankle the night before. about 40 minutes into the set i saw hejumped from a speaker onto the stage floor and curled up into a ball in painful agony. the show was brought to a screaming halt! HUGELY disappointing! on the heels of the cd of the same name i could not have been more amped for this show. it was everything and more i could have wanted. by the time he rolled around again with the show that the vhs tape im now writing about represents i had lost a lot of steam for manson. holywood was so-so. i attended the concert and was unimpressed as i found it to be EXTREEEMELY contrived!!! it was a parody of itself. see manson raise his middle finger and shout obscenities was just so jr. high school. give me a break. seeing him come out in pope gear was even more laughable. musically there were a few good moments but thats all. i can say the same for this vhs tape as its the same show i saw. the only real redeeming value here is the overall recording quality. the picture is crisp, clean and vivid. its not muddy or grainy whatsoever. the recording quality  is equally good. thanks for small favors. i sure hope manson reinvents himself...grows up and pursues artistry again as it looked like he/ they were really doing with mechanical animals. he chickened out fearing he would lose his original fan base when he went glam. it was a timely move as we were ready for a new glam movement. hey manson...move forward...not backward.
B000075BFK|5.0|I've seen some of the reviews and I don't know how anyone can rate Ghetto Star or Never Call You B**ch Again an 8/10 that's ridiculous, Ghetto Star is one of the best if not the best track on the album, Thug Love. The album is great.
B000002KD9|4.0|A solid early record by Neil Young.  It combines both the folksy acoustic and electric sounds.  There isn't much to dislike on this one.  While I prefer Harvest, this comes in a close second.  A record worth owning, even for the casual Young fan.
B000000WA2|5.0|This cd is absolutely brilliant. Among good songs on it there are \\"Charmless Man\\"(which is my all-time favourite song and definately Blur's best song), \\"Country House\\", \\"Mr. Robinson's Quango\\" (a really good song), \\"Stereotypes\\", \\"Best Days\\" and \\"It Could Be You\\". All of the other songs are very good but these are the best in my opinion. <br />If you don't have this CD, get it. You never get tired of it.
B00006ZSAD|5.0|my expectations of this disc were very high. i mean please...we're talking beth gibbons here! a genius writer and performer of modern music. incomparable, unparalleled, uncompromising. i knew intuitively that i would not be disappointed. im here to tell you...im not. this is a masterpiece! kudos must go to all who participated on this disc.the musical nuances/flourishes...an harmonica here, a brief running up and down the piano keys like a light rain there. a wah-wah guitar...subtle angelic background singers. the production values are so high. what you have here is a recording that is virtually distortion free. the listener is given a crisp, deep and expansive listening experience. beth is not only a virtuoso song stylist, but an actress as well. she seems to embody different characters as evidenced by various speech patterns and voices \\"they\\"have. we already knew this marvelous aspect about her artistry from portishead. the songs are a collaboration between herself and paul webb. these are songs that will haunt you. you may not be able to take this cd off your changer. i cannot stop listening and i have had it since november 12th! the first song, 'mysteries,' is like a lullabye. there are arrangements on this disc that harken back to old burt bacharach tunes. i love every song as each one is unique. this is not an easy feat to achieve within a listener. there are electronics used on beths voice that remind you that this is the same creative force from portishead.if i had to pick a fave it would be 'funny time of year.' this is a searing piece. beginning VERY quietly, then building layer upon layer culminating in what is arguably the most arresting and memorable song this year. in fact this for me is the best album of 2002!!you think ive made a case for this disc or what? you think i think you should buy it? how about RIGHT NOW!

0002558122|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a novel based on the misfortunes of Frank McCourt's childhood through early adulthood. McCourt narrates his poverty filled childhood in Ireland. Angela's Ashes became popular because of the way McCourt told his story. The book is full of humor accompanied by the horror, and is told in an emotional, vivid manner. McCourt's life begins in Brooklyn. His family is penniless, and moves back to Ireland, where he spends the rest of his childhood with his mother's family. Angela, the mother, is the backbone of the family. But even at home, Angela's family rejects her because of her marriage to Malachy. Malachy is from the Protestant North, while Angela's family is from the South. Also, Malachy is not able to hold a job, and frequently spends any money he earns on alcohol.<BR>  Young Frank can do little but sit back and watch as his family moves around and siblings die. As he ages, he begins to realize the situation he is in. The overall mood is distinguished by the dark settings. Every house the McCourts live in is in shambles. It is constantly raining. They were forced to beg for food and other necessities because they were unable to financially provide for their family. Frank endured poverty and starvation with only strength and his optimism on life. His schoolmates teased him about his ragged clothes. Through all the loneliness, McCourt manages to instill a ray of hope. <BR> Frank and his brothers and friends manage to find humor and hope despite of all their troubles. For instance, when the boys were playing outside, McCourt stated that the women stand because, all they do is take care of the children, clean the house, and cook. But, the men sit because they spend their time discussing the problems of the world and wondering what to do with the rest of the day (107).This is a humorous, almost satirical look at the traditional male-female roles in a family. His unconditional love for his father starts to be uncertain. Here, Frank decides that he will dowhat he can to escape this poverty and leave for America when he is able to do so. By the time Frank reaches his teenage years, he is the man of the house, and his dreams of going to America are closer than ever. <BR> Through perseverance and determination he eventually raises enough money to travel to America and break free from his depressing childhood. Frank learned to depend upon no one but himself, and with willpower he was able to achieve what he had dreamed of for so long. Frank is a bright student, and realizes that he can rise above the poverty and better himself somehow. Angela's Ashes is an inspiring novel with descriptive images that help to shape his fascinating tale from hardship to victory.
0790731002|5.0|The Batman Forever DVD is awesome! When watching ANY comic book movie you have to keep in mind it is a comic book movie and not Saving Private Ryan. It's visual, cool to look at and listen to, but it probably wont be an Oscar winner; if thats all you expect going in  ...  you'll be happy.  If the suit is cool, the car looks cool, and they're is at least one hot chick after the hero, then all the elements have been met. Granted, that Nicole Kidman kissing Batman while wrapped in a bed sheet is pretty sweet, its still a notch or two lower than Michelle Pfiffer's Catwoman pinning (Michael Keaton) Batman and licking his face (in Batman Returns). Great visual effects, the best Batmobile EVER, a Robin that doesn't look like wimp, and a strong soundtrack over shadow the one thing I didnt like, nipples on the Batsuit. Watch this movie as a comic book movie, take it with a grain of salt, and have fun with it.
6303855512|5.0|SMOKE....A NEW LEVEL OF ENTERTAINMENT!<br />If you thought your life was boring, meaningless, and without any deeper perspective than what you see on the surface...then you haven't seen SMOKE! This brilliant story was created by author Paul Auster and brought to life through the extroadinary talents of Harvey Keitel and William Hurt. Keitel plays Brooklyn tobacco store owner, Auggie Wren. Hurt portrays his customer/friend, Paul, a struggling writer,left emotionally devastated by the death of his pregnant wife and unborn child. There is so much to absorb in this film, but the show belongs to Auggie who finds some order in his disorderly life through photos he takes of his store front....at the same exact time...same exact place...every single day into the years. As time passes before him, the store front is the same, but life evolves into a procession of changing faces and scenes. This unique concept unravels to express the greater continuity of life and totally captivates the viewer. Exceptional photography adds depth to this startling level of awareness and totally captures your complete attention. Stockard Channing, Forest Whitaker, and Ashley Judd are perfect supporting characters in this intertwining tale of tales. Keitel's Christmas story is so thought provoking that characters and audience alike are perfectly connected in the rarest of moments. Sadly, the movie leaves many questions fully unanswered, but perhaps as in life itself, that is the final point to be made!<br />AN INEXCUSABLE OMISSION FOR HARVEY KEITEL AT THE OSCARS!
B00006IR5S|5.0|I really enjoy the soundtrack from the first film, but I think that I have found something even better.  I can listen over and over to this soundtrack and it never gets old.  I have several favorite tracks that others are sure to enjoy.  I remember #2 from the end credits, it enthralled me then as it does now.  3, 9, 11, 14, 19, .... I can't just name a few, they are all great.  I haven't heard William's music sound this good for a while.
0312305060|4.0|Although it took me awhile to get into this book, I ultimately found it to be a rewarding read.  For me this book was all about longing, longing for love (lost and current), longing for identity and self, and longing for solace.  Each of the three characters brings to the story similar and unique perspectives on these needs.  Although I felt for the characters (especially Virginia Woolf), there is a strong sense of aloofness and detachment with these individuals.  We are never fully allowed into their worlds, (especially with Mrs Brown) and we are given only minimal insight into the motivations for their actions.  This distance can leave the reader feeling somewhat unsatisfied (Why are these people doing what they're doing?).  But I think that's the point, it's up to the reader to make up their own mind as to what is going on here.  &quot;The Hours&quot; is thoughtful, pensive and open to a variety of interpretations.  A quick read but certainly not a &quot;light&quot; one.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I spent a good amount of time wondering if I could go through an entire review (albeit short) of this album without mentioning the obvious comparisons (Joy Division), and as you can see, I didn't have much success with that. Their 80's influences aside, Interpol's first full-length release is dark, gloomy, and strangely uplifting in a devious sort of way. One of the best all-time albums to play late at night for the lovelorn. The only downside here is the domestic version of this album doesn't contain the slow-building \\"The Specialist\\" (available on their self-titled EP or by importing a different version of the full-length). It's been awhile since I've heard such a confused, sexually deprived album like this one. I'm amazed I haven't completely burnt myself out on this album as much as I've played it over the past several months, yet this still manages to hold up well. And these boys are really snazzy dressers, too. Well, credit where credit is due.
0553382179|5.0|Well, I wouldn't have a clue wether those two would go together, because I'm not a christian. I also don't like people preaching at me about their god. But I've been on the flylady mailing list since May and my home is improving (slowly, because I sometimes still don't get my but into gear). I don't mind her Godbrezes, in fact I just read over the &quot;g-word&quot; and enjoy what she writes. She doesn't talk about god much actually and I would have noticed if she did (I really dislike people talking about god instead of telling me what I need to know). <BR>What I really love about flylady is that she's always encouraging us. She doesn't say &quot;you can do better than that&quot; or &quot;have you still not done this?!&quot; she can't look into our homes, but sometimes it really fells like she is standing right there telling me &quot;wow, just look at that shiny sink!&quot; and then I spread out the shining because it makes me happy! She encourages by praise and it works, unlike trying to encourage by putting people down for &quot;not having done enough&quot;. Shine your sink, even if you don't do anything else for the day it's okay. Just do one thing everyday to spready the shining and in a weeks time you'll see the difference. Even just one of her hot spot fire drills will make a difference (hot spot=an area where you put thing &quot;for later&quot; and later never comes, so you have one pile of STUFF that makes the whole room look trashed &lt;- mine is my desk :-( But I'm working on it a little at a time. Thank you Fly Lady)<BR>Well, I'm not perfect and I probably won't ever be that but I'm making progress! Thanks to Flylady who's always &quot;standing there your out of my sight&quot; cheering me on when I do something right and telling me &quot;baby steps!&quot; when I feel like I didn't do enough.<br />Flylady there's 5 gold Stars for you.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Each year, if you're lucky, there are those indelible moments when you experience a new album for the first time. You'll remember how you first stumbled across that album, what you were doing as you pressed play for the first time, and even what the weather was like that day. The album's entity becomes interwoven both with the music and the very fabric of your life at a particular point in time. Sometimes, moments like these aren't constricted to just new albums, but rather new bands as well. This year, I had the incredible fortune of discovering both Wilco and YHF for the first time, even attending one of their concerts this past summer, too. By the time I got around to seeing their black &amp; white film documentary \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\", one thing was certain: Wilco had released the album of the year. Combining tinges of alt-country with unorthodox pop arrangements featuring eerie sound samples, YHF requires several listenings in order to truly appreciate the genius moments that flourish on this record even long after you've thought you'd discovered all the concealed surprises contained here.
079073804X|5.0|I admit one thing. I have never seen everything of the Exorcist. I just cannot stand it. January 2001, I bought it on DVD, and sat down a dark winternight to watch it. Alone. I never thought it was that bad. When Regan`s face turned from a girl to the deformed, white-eyed gruesome being, I was afraid down to my bone. It is the worst(not qualitywise) thing I have ever seen, I had to take away the movie and turn off the TV. It took me 6 months just to get her face of my head, and it only prooves one point, The Exorcist is really the scariest movie off all time.<br />I later got my buddies to watch it, and I held my hands infront of my eyes in the worst scenes, so that I never would see her face again. <br />This is pure horror in its rawest form. Its the essence of what fear is made of, your own child being abused to the highest degree, and turned into a monster you cannot watch. <br />When I say that the Exorcist is the worst movie I have seen, I dont mean that it is a bad movie. It is the perfect horrormovie, but it isnt really a movie either, it is more like the perfect documentary and godfather of all that is evil. And when Regan stare at you with her white eyes, you will feel your whole sanity and life be shaken to the ground, from which it for someone...may never be restored. Such was the fact for me, yet I feel in a way scarred for life, but also glad to know that Horror movies will never die as long as The Exorcist is there. <br />I was 20 when I first watched it, back then in January, 2001. I have seen many horrormovies, and I am a big fan of the Genre. But nothing have ever made me cry of pure fear like that night I watched The Exorcist, and that alone makes it the perfect movie ever. <br />Quick note about the film. The Actors play incredible. They all bring this movie to such an reality that has to be seen to believe. The acting are superb, the sounds, the filming, everything is dead on. There is not a single bad point with this movie. For those who are interested in religion, it is certainly interesting, and for those who love the paranormal, it is too(I am an atheist, but I study the paranormal). It can be discussed wether or not this film is about God vs Satan, but no matter how you look at it, it is also about the nightmare every parents go thru when their child is kidnapped/abducted/abused. About how a safe home can turn into hell. How a little cute girl can turn into a demon. One could write pages up and pages down about this movie, but I really think words dont justify it. <br />Some people may laugh...but dont ever dare make fun of this movie. It isnt ment to be funny at all, in fact you will not find ONE moment, one SECOND in this film where they tried to be funny. If you find this movie funny, then you better pray someone will exorcise your demons, because there IS NOTHING FUNNY about it! <br />There, I said it. Sick of young kids and tough teens who blame this film for being stupid and funny. <br />The Exorcist is the greatest horrorfilm ever, and possibly one of the greatest FILMS ever too.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Perhaps the hallmark of a culturally important movie is its ability to inspire serious debate. On this basis,'AI' succeeds entirely. It is nothing less than the best film of director Steven Spielberg's career, the one that will be appreciated by generations of film enthusiasts.<br />The debate about this movie (on [Amazon.com] at least) appears to be about the morality of its technological premise. The fact is that experiments in creating intelligent machines have been going on for years. Anyone who has used a computer may understand this. For that matter man has been attempting to create a better version of himself for hundreds of years. The notion that we may one day create \\"lifelike\\" robots is not so far-fetched. Indeed it seems to be a mere matter of time before we see creatures such as David. After all, if the human mind is capable of dreaming of such a creation (and dreams are central to David's quest in AI) then to some degree mechas already exist. What is such a movie as AI than the realization of a vision of artificiality no different than organic man himself, sometimes even more so? You can see this in David's need to make himself as human, a quest that reminds one of philosophers such as Descartes, who famously stated 'I think, therefore I am.\\" In David's case it could be put as \\"I love, I dream, therefore I am.\\"<br />This is course a central conceit of the movie. In other words, what is the moral bargain we take upon ourselves in the quest to create? What are our obligations to intelligent machines? It's clear that David's mother is the vehicle through which we see this struggle. The enormous emotional strain put upon her is the example of how difficult it shall be to uphold this repsonsibility of acting as gods. Forget whether or not David is a real boy. To his mother he is: he is needy, loving, and imperfect. And if David is capable of those traits, and seeks like many to be loved and find his place in the world, then he must be human. <br />So what isthe point of this anyway? Nothing less than the paradox of existence, really. It may seem hard to believe, but in fulfilling Kubrick's vision of the future, Spielberg has come upon what it means be be alive, to exist, to have been. That is why the last 20 or so minutes of 'AI,' criticized as they have been, are crucial to understanding the intentions of the filmakers.  For it is not just our understanding of life, but what those decisions will lead to for future generations. The advanced robots who find David are humanity's very sons and daughters. They never would have existed without David, but ultimately they belong to man, the next step of \\"human\\" advancement, if that is what they can be called. Remember, it has been said that man cannot really understand God. Likewise, man cannot really understand what man creates. It is left to the future to determine the results of how we acted while alive. In this regard, creating robots who can love and reach out to others is not such a bad idea, after all. There are far worse gifts we could leave for the future.<br />Still not convinced? Watch it again and remember what happens to David when the day with his mother ends. He lies beside her, closes his eyes, and sleeps. But he can't sleep, since he's not human, right? Wrong. The cruelty of Kubrick's premise has come to bear out. The fate of humans, i.e. our foreknowledge of death, has been passed on to mechas; death has been our great gift to them, in return for the desire to love, and it's the ultimate form of self-consciousness. 'AI' is entrancing, mind-shaking and terrifying in its contemplation of life and mortality. Thankfully, however, the experience of living has not been without purpose.
B000001EHS|4.0|Its a tough job trying to cram in as many songs which represent  a career as wide spanning as Def Leppards, but this album does a fairly good job. However as with Bon Jovis &quot;Crossroads&quot;, material from the first two albums are very few and far between. Only the seminal &quot;Bringing on the Heartbreak&quot; makes it from &quot;High n Dry&quot; while &quot;On Through the Night,&quot; didn't get a single song!<br />Maybe I'm being unrealistic. The years from Pyromania to Adrenalize were when Def Leppard were one of the biggest bands on the planet and that was because they were writing outstanding pop/rock songs. It is hard to argue with &quot;Animal,&quot;<BR>&quot;Photograph,&quot; &quot;Armageddon It&quot; and &quot;Billy's Got A Gun&quot;, which incidentally has been inexplicably left off the album (don't get me started on the absence of &quot;Women&quot;). Enough bitchin - this album is full of great songs. Personal faves &quot;When Love and Hate Collide&quot; and &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad.&quot; (Joe Elliot said the latter was the best thing they had ever done to that point). Wasn't that taken with the inclusion of &quot;Action&quot; and I always thought that &quot;Love Bites&quot; was a sensational chorus around a whole lot a nothing whereas &quot;Rocket&quot; is just a whole lot of nothing. Did I say enough bitchin already? Ok. &quot;Two Steps Behind&quot; is a welcome addition and seeing &quot;Heaven Is,&quot; in there was a pleasent surprise and I'd forgotten what a great song &quot;Hysteria&quot; is. <br />Aside from the &quot;nothing from the years before we were famous&quot; track selection, there's nothing wrong with Vault. I suppose apart from making a double album any band with the wealth of great songs that Def Leppard had at their disposal when releasing this record would struggle to please everyone so I will leave you with this question... Why wasn't it a double album?

No magic in buying the book as there is no magic in buying a diet book BUT.. this is written and formulated for those of us who get off-track and spend much of our lives doing nice things but NOT caring for our home regularly every day. She gives a plan using small amounts of time DAILY! It becomes your motivation to check off jobs done and seeing progress made. MANY women have been helped and once again after new challenges in my life I am using a timer to tackle the big jobs 15 minutes at a time. The no whining and complaining attitude helped, too.There is peace of mind in order vs chaos. A worthwhile view of life.
6304005490|4.0|Funny, charming, romantic, is what I have to say about this film. &quot;Doris Day&quot; was a smash. &quot;Rock Hudson&quot; was suave and debonair, he played his roll very well. And what a handsome gent he was. &quot;Tony Randall&quot; was a hoot. He was the funniest of them all. Mr. Webster played by: &quot;Rock Hudson&quot; makes up a phoney Idea called, VIP; to throw &quot;Doris Day&quot; off his track in a business deal. He creates a commercial with a show girl, and calls her the VIP girl. &quot;Doris Day&quot; finds out that the product VIP wasn't a real business deal, and demands that Mr. Webster prove his product exists or face the court for false advertisement. A very funny romantic comedy. I recommand it for the whole family to watch.
B0000524CY|5.0|the director said it best when he said, &quot; a person brings to the exorcist what they are as a person and leave in the same fashion&quot;. In response to an earlier review about people laughing at it and saying it was funny, those kinds of people have nothing to bring to the movie. These kinds of people get lost when matters of faith and devotion come up, simply because they are of a character that does not understand such  ideals or values in life. So really there review is worthless. As far as the dvd itself. I thought the spider walk should have been kept in the original, soundtrack awesome, and i find the earlier scenes with reagan tie the whole progression of her possesion together a little more neatly. All in all, the exorcist is twice as scary as any other horror movie ever made, if only because of how it makes you look at your own values and morals in such a disturbing way.

0743455967|3.0|On writing is a version of Steven King himself as a child.  He talks about his mother and her jobs, plus most of the places he lived as a child.  He is a fowl-mouthed writher who gets right to the point.  Although, reading this book might inspire you into writing a novel, don't think it is going to happen in one day.  He describes a toolbox as useful elements in the writing process.  King also describes other writers in their ways of writing, such as H.P. Lovecraft, James Joyce, Harper Lee, and John Grisman to name a few.  <br />Writing is a true dedication in order to write a story you must have your mind set.
0553382179|5.0|Marla Cilley (The Flylady) has written a book that is slowly changing my life.  This book not only gives tips for house cleaning and getting organized, it is about changing your life style to avoid chaos (can't have anyone over syndrome).  I can honestly say that this book is one of the best that I have ever read.  Many say that to lose weight, you must change your life style.  This book has changed my attitude about house cleaning, parenting, relationships, work habits, and more than I can go into here.  I wish that I could give this book a hundred stars, it deserves it.
0767836286|3.0|This story is really engaging and the plot is good.  It is often hard to get this type of movie to play well on screen, often the personal interactions between characters only come across well in book form, but I think the tension between Bridges and Robbins in this movie come across as feeling real.<br />While not a really &quot;scary&quot; movie there are some scenes that do play very tense and make the movie a good thriller even though it is far from an action flick.<br />The story is one that makes you think and that fact overcomes the underlining problem of being a bit slow at times.  All in all it is a good movie and well worth watching.  Because of the twists which are only really fun to watch once and the lack of fast paced action it may fall in the rental category but it is definitely worth watching.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I AM NOT REALLY USED TO THIS GENRE IN MUSIC, BECAUSE I GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD THAT ONLY LISTENED TO ONE TYPE OF MUSIC. THANKS TO MTV AND VH1 FOR MAKING ME WANT OT ACCEPT OTHER GENRES OF MUSIC. ONE DAY I WAS LISTENING TO Q1043 IN N.Y., EARLY IN THE AM AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD A PINK FLOYD SONG, BUT I REMEMBERED HOW KEVIN SPACY'S CHARACTER IN AMERICAN BEAUTY LOVED THEM SO MUCH. SO SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND CAME ON, I JUST LISTENED TO THE LONG INSTRUMENTAL THAT WAS REALLY BREATH TAKING, AND THAT JUST TOOK ME TO ANOTHER LEVEL, THE SONG HAD ME DEEP IN AWE. AND IT WAS A DOUBLE PLAY TUESDAY SO RIGHT AFTER THAT THEY PLAYED HEY YOU WHICH HAS A GREAT MESSAGE TO IT. THE NEXT DAY I RUSHED TO THE LOCAL MUSIC STORE AND SAW ECHOES,THAT WAS THE ONLY ALBUM THERE SO I BOUGHT IT, LISTENED TO IT ON THE TRAIN HOME AND I JUST LOVED WHAT MY EARS WERE ACCEPTING! I HAVE TO GET THE ORIGINAL TRACKS! ALL IN ALL I LIKE THIS BAND A LOT, THE SONGS HELP ME OUT A LOT ON BAD DAYS TOO, WAY BETTER THAN THE RAP THAT I OFTEN LISTENED TO IN THE PAST. PINK FLOYED ROCKS FOREVER!
B00006F2TV|4.0|Very entertaining flick, even for those that aren't into comic books or super hero's.  I thought the special effects and the costumes were all well done.  The acting was good and the story basically made sense (although there were a couple of coincidences that were a bit hard to take).  This movie is definitely worth watching.<br />On the negative side I felt that it lacked the super \\"Blockbuster\\" appeal that certain movies have that make them watchable over and over again.  I am not sure that I can pin point why that is but I can make a few guesses:<br />The villain was too \\"convenient\\" (who he is and the timing are too coincidental) and he didn't have any evil cohorts.  The acting by Dafoe was excellent but the situations he was in and the surrounding story line just weren't as strong.<br />The transition from normal Peter Parker into Spider-man was a bit forced and making all the time frames work was obviously a problem.  This is also why the timing between the good and bad characters and how they meet was awkward.  Perhaps the film should have started with Spider-man being around for a long time already and simply just fighting evil.  Then Spider-man II could have been made showing the touching and romantic part of his growing up, the high school sweetheart part of the story, etc.  In X-men we just got Wolverine in action, right off the bat, and it plays better.  I don't remember a lot of background story in the first Superman movie either.  In other words, we already knew he gets bit by a spider...<br />The romantic part of the story was on the soft side.  Does every super hero by night have to be a sucker by day?  I guess it's part and parcel of the genre but I felt it was flat on screen.  Anyway, the acting was good and I am not being critical of the performances.<br />I recommend this movie, it is fun to watch, but it isn't on my \\"got to own it\\" list.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Legendary Director William Wyler chose Audrey Hepburn (little know actress & her first leading role - wins Best Female Actress Oscar!) to play a princess who sneaks away for a self proclaimed one day holiday, from her royal duties while visiting Rome.  She encounters American newsman (Gregory Peck - in a very believable comedy/love role) who finds out she is a princess in hiding. Peck decides to exploit the opportunity by selling his exclusive story for $5,000.  As all 1950's movies they end up falling in love and spend a very adventurous day site seeing in this outstanding motion picture.  Royal duties, diplomacy and reality bring this romantic encounter to an end. What makes this movie work is the genius direction of William Wyler & the genuine on screen chemistry between Hepburn & Peck.<br />This is a perfect Black & White Full Screen Format remastered digital motion picture with dolby digital sound.  An OUTSTANDING viewing experience.<br />Many Extras to include; Remembering \\"ROMAN HOLIDAY\\" documentary, Restoring \\"ROMAN HOLIDAY\\" featurette, Clothes Designer \\"EDITH HEAD - The Paramount Years\\" featurette, Photo Galleries, and Trailers<br />This is a must have for your family DVD library, especially for Hepburn & Peck fans!!!  Enjoy.
B000065U1N|5.0|watching this movie feels like youre watching CNN, only with much better camera work. dont get bogged down too much by plot or dialogue or even acting for that matter, because this film is about one thing: ACTION. i have never seen a movie quite like this one. the battle scenes (pretty much the whole movie) are simply amazing. you will be in awe of just how real this movie feels. it portrays war exactly how it is: crazy and gritty. i cant stop singing the praises of the way this movie smacks you in the head with both audio AND visual. turn off the lights, turn UP your surround sound, and prepare to be blown away!
B00005JL96|5.0|\\"Lilo and Stitch\\" is my favorite Disney movie.  That is cool that the Director and the voice of Stitch (Chris Sanders)  Made this movie and came up with the idea for Stitch.  This movie is way different from all the other Disney movies.  The DVD is great, but it doesn't have the part where Stitch says: \\"I'm not soft and fluffy.\\"  I don't know what is my favorite part.  Maybe the part where Lilo teaches Stitch how to Hula!  Or where Stitch picks up the car and says \\"Blue Punch Buggy!\\"  Or where Stitch says: \\"I like fluffy!\\" Or where he says: \\"Also cute and fluffy!\\"
B00000K31Q|4.0|10 Things I Hate About You is more of a say She's All That type of love story with a bit a comedy here and there. I wounldn't consider this a full scale comedy but it still a very good movie. <br />Julia Styles and Larissa Oleynick star as sisters under the chain of their paranoid dad. In a hasty decision, he decides that his girls can date... BUT only they are both dating and the younger Oleynick is under the supervision of her mean, boy hating older sister Sytles is there. So in figuring out her dad's loop hole, her love interest (Joseph Levitt) gets his friend (Heath Ledger) to date Sytles so Levitt can date Oleynick. <br />What I really like about this movie was that it was pretty much plain and simple in how the movie was going to be early. I hate it when comedies change up in the middle and throw you off. That and the parts that are funny, are really funny (like the prom). That and it has a really great date movie feel to it because it's funny enough to be an easy ice breaker but serious enough so that it makes an impact. <br />O would recommend this movie to younger viewers because it would be easier for say teens to relate to it. Older viewers will like it but it won't have the &quot;ooh ahh&quot; feeling that teens and younger viewers will get from it. Great movie and perfect for sitting back with a date for a laugh.

B000031WD9|5.0|American Pie in one sentence is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's about 4 friends who have never had sex so in a pact, they all agree to lose their virginity by prom night. <br />This movie was just funny as hell and I could not stop laughing! There are numerous hilarious scenes that will honest to God make you laugh until you almost pee on yourself. <br />I won't lie, some people won't like this movie because let's face it yeah, there's just a lot of fart jokes in it and that there is a little bit of toilet humor. But other than that, it'll keep you laughing.<br />Also, if you're going to get American Pie, don't forget to pick up American Pie 2 because that will keep you rolling. Enjoy!
6304211740|4.0|This is a fine version of JANE EYRE, and I loved the soundtrack and the actors...most of them.  Elle MacPherson must have had a connection somewhere to have scored the role of Blanche Ingram.  She doesn't cut it as a blonde, and certainly not as a high-society gal of the 1830's.  This is sometimes what happens when supermodels insist on acting.  Charlotte G. as Jane was totally believable.  She was plain and stoic enough to carry it off.<br />The sequence of events in the beginning was very rushed.  Within the space of a two days she fights with her cousins, is spirited away to Lowood School, foments a friendship with Helen Burns, and is with Helen on her deathbed.  In the book, all that unfolds within several months, not just two days.
6304106017|4.0|The first half of this hardcore action flick has George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino hijacking a mobile home to get across the border into Mexico. The second half is our heroes fighting off vampires in a strip club. The two don't come together very well, but both halves are executed perfectly with a cutting edge and some very cool dialogue. This film is all about blood, violence, and gore mixed with some T&A, making this a young man's dream movie. Constantly exciting and always taut, \\"From Dusk till Dawn\\" is the perfect movie for parties or just hangin out with the guys. The special effects are cool, the direction is slick and the acting is [excellent].

B000002U82|5.0|The album rode the charts for about 13 years, so you know it has to be good. &quot;Time,&quot; &quot;Money,&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage&quot; are the best on the album. &quot;On the run&quot; is probably the trippiest song ive ever heard. Every song is worth it. If you dont have it, u should.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Spawned from two bands who have never been known to compromise their sound, their principles, their integrity, or their creativity, Audioslave have managed to live up to the high expectations a collaboration such as this inherently merits. Morello's brilliance on 6 strings remains unparalleled in it's creative, aggressive, and sometimes simply wierd nature - this time incorporating more honest elements of himself such as blues and jazz licks throughout the album. Cornell fans won't be able to stop themselves from impersonating his \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" video while listening along. The seering soaring vocals never cease to amaze true music fans. The lyrics continue to be top-notch and will make you think, if you can. All in all, if you've seen the music video for \\"Cochise\\", look out for more incredibly intense music throughout, though every song isn't a total rock-out. The record is tastefully and wonderfully peppered with soon-to-be classic ballads as \\"Like a Stone\\" (most notably), \\"I Am the Highway\\", \\"Exploder\\", and \\"Hypnotize\\". Though some may find the songs \\"just a blend of the two talents\\", the album won't leave you unsatisfied in any way if you were a fan of Soundgarden OR Rage. This record has the ambition of becoming a defining album for the first decade of the new millenium and only true appreciators of rock music in general will live up to the title, \\"Audioslave\\" by becoming one themselves when they've heard it. The effort is the best the four musicians have created to date in their careers and should be extremely proud. I for one am extremely grateful the four are alive in the same soundspace, they truly inspire me.
B00005JK8K|2.0|Director John Woo, known for his talent in action films, creates what is probably his worst film with Windtalkers. The idea sounds great: A gifted director of action makes a war film full of battles. But the result is a mess of war clichés and run-of-the-mill action scenes.<br />The film follows a sergeant (Nicolas Cage) in World War II on an assignment to protect a Navajo-code talker in the midst of taking control of a Japanese-held Island.  But unfortunately the potentially interesting story never seems to break out from underneath the action.<br />What most strikes a foul chord, though, are the terrible, corny war clichés. One soldier hands his wedding band to a friend with instructions to return it to his wife if he dies. The next scene he dies. A hardened soldier who doesn't seem to care about anyone helps a poor Japanese child when he thinks no one is looking. Another racist soldier finds out his ways are wrong. Not one scene in Windtalkers is original, they're just cringe worthy. It's all been done much better before.<br />Of course, intellectual drama isn't Woo's strong point, his action is. So this war film must have great battle action scenes right? Wrong, wrong, wrong. They are boring, tired retreads of better action scenes from other war films. What was Woo doing here? Did he really direct this film?<br />There were a few glimmers of hope during some scenes, but they didn't last long enough to ever make this film enjoyable. The masses may see this film and think it was decent, then quickly forget about it because it really wasn't. For World War II action, stick with Saving Private Ryan.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album shows the diversity of the band. Its not Rage Against The Machine or Soundgarden. I think they can be one of the first bands to overcome their previous bands. Every song on the album is great. It's a new sound, and that's what we need!

B00006JDVV|4.0|What with computers making virtually (pun intended) every kind of special effect possible, it is really easy to make a scifi/fantasy film with terrific effects and no point at all. Happily this is not the case with Reign of Fire, a postapocalyptic film with a novel twist. Here is the thesis: a Very Bad Thing is released into the environment by accident, and as a consequence of human frailty and foolishness the entire race is treatened.  The implication is that this happened once before, and that the destruction then was so complete that there is no memory of the event, only legend - as a result of this accident, our worst imagined fairy tale becomes real. It will be no surprise to anyone reading this that the dragon is the legendary flying beast. They spread relentlessly and devour everyting in their path. Man is reduced to pretechnologic clans struggling for suvival, waiting for the dragons to run out of food and die off. The hope is that man will survive by default. Now arrives, if only a little implausibly, a guy with his high tech team that is trying to be more proactive; kill the only male and the species will die. Here then is the subplot, and the Big Picture. Which is the right path? Proactive or passive? Tech or spirit? The answer of course is the former, but the resolution of this, and the romantic accessory plot is engaging. The special effects are very good, and the premise is unusual for the postapocalyptic thriller. Face it, this isn't Citizen Kane, but it is worth watching, and is a cut above the average fantasy.
0553381709|5.0|Can it be a true?  A great fantasy epic not trapped to follow the opening sequence of LotR?  Where's the powerful magician coming to visit the town?  How about a mysterious stranger lending a life saving aid?  Someone whose name most resembles Tolkien (two middle names initial r. r.?) writes a great fantasy novel devoid of significant similarities (I mean how can any author not have similarities to Tolkien even a little while writing anything 'fantasy'?).<br />Well G.R.R. Martin certainly did just that.  As if on a quest to break the major rules of fantasy writing, anyone who's dead tends to stay dead on his series.  And the 'good' guys are not impervious to death either.  I find it refreshing for an author to be so definite and bold.  And his boldness doesn't in any way mar his great story.  Quite the opposite, it lends to the story and briskly carries the story along (and on some cases too brisk, but that's nit-picking).  <br />I don't know who started having more main characters then can be counted with one hands (Robert Jordan jumps to mind) but I do find it distorting to read couple of chapter about one character and to have it abrubtly end to start fresh with another.  I'll tell it straight off, I don't like reading about certain character's exploits.  On the topic of stating the cons, I've heard some people not liking this series due to its overt amount of sexual content.  Sexual content - more stronger then your average fantasy fair (ok, more so then ALL the other fantasy series) but I don't find it in any way to be 'overt'ly sexual.<br />Lovely series thus far.  Here's hoping GRR Martin doesn't make more then 6 books on this series.
B00005Y1Y3|3.0|I'm a hard-core fan so i didn't spent my money on this cd, i bought the two complete concerts and the rehearsal. 3 double cds that contains all that's on this one and much more. Of course, if you're just a moderate fan, this is a great deal but for a hard-core fans who wants everything and more, buy the complete concerts direct from bright midnight records, otherwise, you would be greatly disppointed to find out that there are complete concerts available and that you just buy some excerpts of the concerts. A hard-core fans buys anything, to be one of them, you must have at least 10 bootlegs like i do.

B000001FQI|5.0|The underlying theme of this album is society issues and attitudes - using music as a healing balm for humanity - a very deliberate attempt..which succeeds remarkably well. In true 'Tears for Fears' style.<br />'Woman in chains' is a brilliant beginning. Very soothing, it sets a pace which is ideal, and gets you thirsting for more.<br /> 'Look at your self/See all your life/your hands start shaking/and you dont know why' is a line from 'Badman's Song' which got my hands trembling, shaking all over. Oleta Adams is amazing and the piano is superb.<br />'Advice for the young at heart' sounds more commercial, but the theme meshes well and gives the album variety.<br />'Sowing the seeds of love' the title song has an energetic and racy feel, full of enthusiasm and light-hearted goodness.<BR> <BR>Third world sentiments are discussed in 'Standing on the corner of the third world'. I was transported, endorphins flowing fast through my veins. Same story with 'Swords and Knives' with lyrics like - 'When life begins/ with needles and pins / it ends with swords and knives'. Very satisfying.<br />'Famous last words' ends the album on a tender note.<br />The music is top class, a mixture of everything. It truly deserves every one of the five stars I have granted it.
B00006IR5S|5.0|Like the Chamber of Secrets Movie, this soundtrack may be a sequel, but it is new and refreshing in its own right.  While adapting music from the first soundtrack in 'Prologue', 'Harry's Wondorous World', parts of 'Meeting Tom Riddle', and 'Reunion of Freinds', it is the new material that distinguishes this album.  'Fawkes the Phoenix' is perhaps the best Williams theme I have heard since ET's 'Flying Theme'.  With sweeping strings, and powerful winds and brass, it is a beautiful theme that can't help but uplift the listener.  'The Chamber of Secrets' is a menacing tune that incorporates the feelings of unease and fear very well to the movie's theme.  'The Spiders' and 'Meeting Aragog' start out with a chilling descending motif that makes the skin crawl with the visualization of the eight legged monsters.  'Fawkes is Reborn' revisits the 'Fawkes the Phoenix' theme, but is now slowed and is given more developement in the middle, without hearing the rousing full orchestra rendtion of the original 'Fawkes' theme until the very end of the track.  Better than the first soundtrack in my opinion, highlighted by the miraculous 'Fawkes the Phoenix'.  The only thing I could have asked for more was a full 'Hedwigs Theme' from the first soundtrack reappearance like 'Harry's Wondorous World', but it is still an imporvement on already classic themes.
B00003CX8V|5.0|In \\"The Apartment\\", Jack Lemmon gets to showcase and stretch his acting ability like in no other movie, and that's why it's my favorite Lemmon flick.  Being a mixture of comedy and drama, we get to see Lemmon's raw talent and the ease at which he is able to accommodate the requirements of a given scene.<br />The 60's N.Y city setting is the perfect backdrop for Lemmon's attempt to climb up the ladder of success, by allowing his \\"higher-up\\" co-workers at the insurance company where they work access to his apartment for their various trysts and affairs.  While the whole thing started as more or less an accident, Lemmon (\\"C.C. Baxter\\") puts up with the many inconveniences of the arrangement because he quickly sees the value (\\"business-wise\\", that is) of his beneficent behavior.  And it seems to pay off when he finally receives a promotion, only to discover that his new boss (\\"Mr. Sheldrake\\", played by Fred MacMurray) also wants in on the apartment \\"action\\".  The plot then thickens when Lemmon begins to fall for an elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) who happens to be the girl that Sheldrake is having an affair with.....<br />The storyline moves quickly so there is never a boring moment and the viewer easily becomes sympathetic to Baxter, who ultimately must make the \\"career vs. integrity\\" decision.  As the movie continues, the funny lines and scenes (and they are top-notch) diminish somewhat and the more poignant moments surface - Lemmon is equally at home in both worlds.  MacMurray as \\"the villain\\" works surprisingly well, and although I am not a Shirley MacLaine fan, she is excellent in this movie.<br />The DVD quality is very good and far surpasses my old VHS copy, plus it's in wide screen format.<br />Directed by Billy Wilder.  The black and white works exceptionally well, creating an ironic sense of isolation and despair in the ever-bustling and often humorous world of unstoppable human.....progress?  Not only my favorite Lemmon movie, but one of my favorite movies period, and one I watch 2 or 3 times each year.  Highly recommended.
0066214122|4.0|not up to usual Crichton standards.  Like another reveiwer, I felt as though we got an abridged version.  The plot is engaging and the science is interesting, but this story could have been another Jurassic Park at the microscopic level but never achieves the grandeur of that great novel.  I felt cheated by this novel, mainly because I have come to expect so much from Crichton and this book simply does not reach the quality I am used to from this talented author.  Nevertheless, I still give it 4 stars because it is better reading than just about anything out there.
B000063CPL|5.0|Live in front of 250,000 fans. This cd is full of Maiden classics. 18 songs total, 6 songs from \\"Brave New World\\" 2 from the Blaze era. If you saw this tour then this is must have!! If you are getting into Maiden and want more bang for you buck, pick this up. I have gone through 2 copies of this cd already and I still have not gotten tired of it. It also comes with two multimedia peices, a good intro to the DVD of the same name.<br />If you are thinking of buying any Iron Maiden cd buy this along with Live After Death, you WON'T be let down!!
0385503954|5.0|there's nothing else like this book.  this is probably my favorite book at the moment.
B00005R23S|3.0|Side one was Fabulous!!,but side two<BR>except for \\"The Promise\\" was a big<BR>dissapointment. Born in the USA and<BR>Thunder Road were done in a sleepwalk<BR>no moving or life at all. The songs were made <BR>popular the way the original was done,not<BR>some new slow crawling version
0345448898|5.0|Never has their been such a series-<BR>spell-binding and magnificiant. A dark and thought-provoking tale that will have you begging for more. Some may argue that Pullman is an Athiest, but I feel that he is exposing teens to the harshness of the world. Rediculing the Church and suggesting that God is not the Creator can only broaden one's mind; in this way Pullman proposes thoughts and questions that very few dare to speak. People of all ages can enjoy these books, but since it is partly a coming of age series I would highly recommend these novels to pre-teens and teens. <br />After I finished the last book, I felt so profoundly effected by Pullman's words I just couldn't stop thinking about them, and I still haven't. Do yourself a favor, and buy this amazing series, which rivals that of Harry Potter!
B000065U1N|1.0|I am going to be to the point. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. WHY?<br />1) No features<br />2) Full Metal Jacket beats this movie<br />3) Acting so-so<br />4) Story okay but not good enough for you to spend full price.<br />5) It is too long and never gets to the point.<br />6) No minorities at least not enough and they were in a Africa(HELLO)<br />7) Leave no man behind? They left and made them run- patriotic enough for you.<br />If you are into war then buy it- but at least buy it for less. Go somewhere else and buy it full 50% off or something. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.<br />If you aren't into war movies- simply pass by.<br />If you are into war movies so-so buy something else.<br />Simple enough for you?
B00005TT77|3.0|At first, I thought this collection of Beatles covers was really good. Indeed, some of the songs are inspired, particularly the Eddie Vedder, but the collection, as a whole, doesn't age well at all. This has long been out of my regular CD rotation.<br />Oh, and who on earth thought of that song segueway on the end of the Ben Folds' &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;? Awful.
0553382179|5.0|Flylady has saved my life, my marriage and my family. Need I say more? Its not about 'cleaning' my house. Its about changing ME. changing my attitude and Finally Loving Yourself! She taught me things, such simple things, that Inever really thought about. Even my daughter knows who &quot;our flylady&quot; is!
B00004THAY|5.0|I haven't listened to either B.B. King or Eric Clapton's albums (like Tears in Heaven, which I still don't intend to purchase up to now) before.  And I do think the old original songs recorded by both artists won't attract me.  But the songs on this album, newly recorded, profoundly collaborated and excellently performed and jammed by the two great guitarists, is so great that even I don't know which one compose them, I listen to it again and again.  It's such a great idea to bring the two great blues guitarists together and produce en excellent album!  A classic!  Thank you!!!
0441172717|5.0|After I read the prelude, I thought that it was great. This book is far beyond great. Best book of the Saga so far, with lots of imagination and creativity. IT's a great twist about a boy named Paul Muadib, who might be the famous Kwistiz Haderach. The evil harkonnens plan on a plot an his family. He turns for revenge. Filled with adventure, action, and a great scifi story, this is a well reccomended book.
B00006CXXU|5.0|If I am ever asked 'What Is The Album Of The Year' I would say Stripped, but I would go even further as to say that it is 'The Best Album Ever'. In time Christina will have achieved the same status as Mariah Carey and you can tell with just 1 listen of this album.<br />01. Stripped (Part 1) - A Day/Week/Month/Year in the life of Christina<br />02. Can't Hold Us Down (featuring Lil' Kim) - This track is the girl anthem of the album, with guest vocals from Lil' Kim it shows the potential in a song when to Diva's join forces. The 1st of a number of up-beat tracks.<br />03. Walk Away - With the 1st listen I was hooked, Christina sings about how somethings are so good there bad for you, and you just can't seem to let them go. This is defenitley a stand-out track.<br />04. Fighter - With more of a Rock feel, Fighter showcases the fact that Pop isn't the only music style Christina can sing. With this song about the people who saw cash then told, it's no wonder Christina's mad.<br />05. Primer Amor (Interlude) - I have no Idea what's said in this song, but it's an Interlude so it really doesn't matter. :)<br />06. Infatuation - Packed with the ol' Latin style, A favourite from the 1st time I heard her sing it at the Closing Ceremony of the Winter Olympics.<br />07. Love's Embrace (Interlude) - As the title suggest's it's a Love Embrace.<br />08. Loving Me 4 Me - A slow jam, with sultry lyrics and a Jazzy voice.<br />09. Impossible - This song was penned by Alicia Keys and is defenitley another stand-out track, just picture yourself in a smoked filled room with this being done live.<br />10. Underappreciated - There's always 1 song on an album that is a let down, and this has to be it (for me anyway).<br />11. Beautiful - \\"I am Beautiful no matter what they say\\", if this isn't anything to go by then I don't know what is. This track has #1 HIT written all over it.<br />12. Make Over - When listening to this song the first thing to spring to mind is the band 'Hole', with a Courtney Love feel this is the one song that is different to everything else on the album.<br />13. Cruz - The opening words may put people off, but just wait until halfway through the song and you'll see how fantastic it really is. Defenitley my 2nd favourite track of the album.<br />14. Soar - Sounding like something Celine Dion would sing, a very uplifting track, This is the song where Christina really does show her voacl arrangement.<br />15. Get Mine, Get Yours - With 1 listen you know that it has a [] message that's waiting to be told.<br />16. Dirrty (featuring Redman) - Whoever says this is a letdown really doesn't know their music. With so much hype surrounding the video, no wonder the song failed to Blow up the charts in the US. This for me is the single off the YEAR..<br />17. Stripped (Part 2) - Christina tells it like it is, and if you can't deal with that TOO BAD.<br />18. The Voice Within - For me this is 'I Turn To You (Part 2)' with meaningful lyrics it's a song anyone can relate to.<br />19. I'm Okay - Cries Cries Cries, I absolutely love this song, The #1 standout track on the album, Christina tells the story of a troubled childhood.<br />20. Keep On Singing My Song - A very pleasant round-off to the ending off an album, time tells me it's time to Start all over again.<br />Over-all this is the best work I've heard in a long time.<br />If I were Britney Spears I'd be shaking in my boots, ain't no-one gonna come close to how personal this album is.<br />I wish I could give it more STARS cause it really does deserve MORE....
B00006LSCX|5.0|Almost a year after the UK release of Fever comes the new 2 cd set of her hugely successful cd. I bought this from Amazom.co.uk and this cd features the first disc of Fever. The main difference from the original Fever is the inclusion of the new radio mix for &quot;Come Into My World&quot; that is only on the cd single. The rest of the cd still holds up well and continues to sound incredible. The hits are &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot;(#1 for 4 weeks UK/# 7 US), &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; (#3 UK),&quot;Love At First Sight&quot;(#2 UK/#23 US) and the newest single &quot;Come Into My World (#8 UK). But there are still more hits off this cd if EMI or Capitol will see fit. To me &quot;More More More&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot; and especially &quot;Your Love&quot; could be huge hits. Then the cd comes with a second disc of mixes. You get the rare &quot;Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head(4:02), &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; (Scumfrog's Beauty &amp; The Beast Vocal Edit)-4:27 ,&quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; (Tim Deluxe's Dirty Dub Mix)-6:51, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; (Roger Sanchez Release The Dub Mix)-7:16,  &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;(US Radio mix by Ruff &amp; Jam)-3:46 and only a promo for US radio stations, &quot;Come Into  My World&quot;(Fischerspooner Mix)-4:17 and very electronica. The final track is the track from the Scooby Doo soundtrack the very catchy &quot;Whenever You Feel Like It&quot; (4:05).    This cd shows the strength of Kylie and hopefully she will continue to grow as an artist.
0140072187|5.0|Mason explanation of the preparation he undertook to improve his chances of success at helicopter training provide an excellent example of how to be successful at any endeavor.<br />A great read.  Worthy of purchase in hardcover and a treasured spot on your bookshelf.
B0000025JT|5.0|This album is a very personal album for me in that I got it as a birthday gift for my 10th birthday in 1980. I think this is the best album of her career. The huge hits include \\"Woman In Love\\"(#1 for 3 weeks),\\"Guilty\\" (#3),\\"What Kind Of Fool\\"(#10) and \\"Promises\\"(#50). The whole album is just incredible. From the non hits of \\"The Love Inside\\" to \\"Life Story\\" to \\"Run Wild\\" to \\"Never Give Up\\" to the EPIC ballad \\" Make It Like A Memory\\" which I swear Guns 'N Roses copied for \\"November Rain\\"-- the songs and the vocals are very emotional. Just an incredible job by Barry Gibb. He went on to produce huge hits for Dionne Warwick,Kenny Rogers and Diana Ross but none feature the emotion and beauty as the Guilty album. Incredible.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie Wonder is a musical legacy, a living legend.  His talent knows no boundaries as this wonderful collection is testament to. I have enjoyed his music throughout my whole life (yes, whole life!) and this double cd holds many a good memory spanning all that time! His ability to make you feel good and send messages of hope through his music is an amazing unique gift. I know many of his musical contemporaries would agree.  He's a one off, never to be duplicated, excellent musician and songwriter. Thank You Stevie!
B000070WJE|5.0|This album is so aweomse! I got it yesterday and I haven't been able to put ity away! the other people are way too cynical! This album, if it was released in the states, would so win the audience over. and! i mean it's awesome the whole LA things. But i do agree with the alienating the UK fans thing. He sounds more american now... BUY IT! all of the tunes rock! especially \\"feel\\", \\"sexed up\\", and \\"me and my monkey\\" which will make you laugh so hard.
B00004SYWZ|3.0|I rate this album 3 stars only because it's one that hasn't struck me with the same unique and catchy seduction the way that A-Ha's first album &quot;Hunting High &amp; Low&quot; did. I didn't even know A-Ha was still recording new music, and learned of this particular release after hearing &quot;I Wish I Cared&quot; on Smallville. I was smitten immediately, and had to find the source. The title cut is good, as well as &quot;Little Black Heart&quot;, and of course, &quot;I Wish I Cared&quot; is my favorite on the album. This album isn't the pop sound of A-Ha's first release, but I think it shows growth and versatility.
B0000017CA|3.0|the singer does sound like the guy from creed.
B000002L7Y|5.0|This was my first introduction to A-ha's music - back in the 80's when \\"Take On Me\\" was on MTV, and the subsequent releases from this album \\"Train of Thought\\" and \\"Hunting High & Low\\" came out. I knew I had to own it. I just recently replaced my original vinyl version with the cd version, so I can enjoy it again and again in my car. Morten Harket has an incredible voice, with soulful range and sexy growls. This one's a keeper for sure!
071484232X|5.0|This is the best J.W. Waterhouse book ever published. It's filled with tons of big color photos and information. I recommend this book to everybody who loves him.
B000002VCT|5.0|Pyramid is nothing short of a masterpiece.  But the Egyptian overtones and pyramid motif is just a surface, a tangible stage set, if you will. What this album really seems to be about, lyricaly and intellectualy, is man and his quest for eternal life and coming to grips (or not) with one's own inevitable mortality. Just look at the song titles... \\"In the lap of the Gods\\", \\"Can't take it with you\\", \\"The Eagle will rise again\\" \\"One more river\\" you get the idea.   Hammer dulcimers, timpanis, Egyptian flutes, a heavy choir, and other exotic instruments blend with rock instrumentation and the result is one of the greatest recording projects ever captured on tape. Recorded at Alan's home away from home, EMI Abbey Road studios London, it sounds like is was recorded in and around the pyramids with echo, atmosphere and grandiosity.  Colin Blunstone's sole vocal contribution on \\"Eagle will rise\\" is beautiful, un forced and sorrowful beyond description. One of the greatest vocal performances ever, to my ears.  The instrumental \\"In the lap of the Gods\\" is bold, dynamic, exotic, powerful and damn near overwhelming...Wow! turn up and test your audio system's abilities with that one my friend.  Pyramid is a complete (theme) album and I prefer to listen to it it's entirety from start to finish when possible.     Pyramid is like buried, forgotten (Egyptian) treasure. I bought the original vinyl album on a gamble as a curious teenager on it's first release back in 1978. Good move. I've never come across Pyramid in anyone else's record/cd collection since then(?)   Most people are duly impressed and curious when I slyly slip it into the car/home stereo. Personaly I never tire of hearing Pryamid and never will.  Even the un-remastered CD sounds incredible.  One of the greatest recordings of all time. A desert island disc without question.    \\"If all things must pass even a Pyramid won't last\\"
630027120X|5.0|Absolutely one of the finest portrayals of the founding of the Americas (Brazil).  I am a history buff who has been to Brazil many times and this film electrifys me.  My VHS copy has worn out because I recommend it so highly and lend it out so many times.  I will not buy another VHS: I have to have it on DVD.  Please Tell me when it comes out and I will spread the word!
B00003W8NM|5.0|The movie was great as is the book of Fight Club. All of Chuck Palahniuk's work should be made into movies. His stories have a great underlying meaning, which is usually about breaking people down to their simplest. I mean to the point that people are equal and that material posessions and common thought are not what they seem. The point is that his stories make you think beyond what we are traditionally accustomed to. His stuff is definetly not meant to be watched or read just once.
B000060MMI|4.0|After reading the other reviews I'd like to invite some of the overzealous reviews to settle down a bit.  I agree with some of the others here who liked Swagger better.  However, just like the others, I still like this album too (it's ok to have a preference...really, it is)!<br />While the lyrics don't seem to be as insightful and meaningful on this album as they have been on previous albums, the musical arrangements make up for it.  This album is just plain fun!  You might think it sounds like the Pogues (or even the Sex Pistols) and you might be correct in thinking that - but, it doesn't detract from the fact that this album is a blast to listen to.<br />If I were allowed to give a fractional rating I would give a 3.5.  I decided to round up just on the fact that this album has the best title I've seen in years!<br />And for the record - the young lady who blasted those of us who prefer Swagger to this album...Behind the Green Door is not their third cd - it is their first cd, folled by Swagger and Drunken Lullabies.<br />Love ya,<br />Noel<br />P.S. Dave, if you read this....\\"I tawt I was home....I tawt I was home...\\"

B00000JLWW|1.0|Powerful evidence that good actors can sell even the most ridiculous of scripts to audiences world-wide. Reading the reviews here, I've come to the judgement that those who hated *Titanic* are awfully hard on Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (the female reviewers even griping about Ms. Winslet's hair-color). This criticism is misdirected. If you think these two are bad actors, consider the possibility of such no-talents as Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt in the roles of Jack and Rose. The movie would never have been released, doubtless.  Heck, the actors -- and I include Billy Zane as the villainous, millionaire fiancee and his manservant, a hilariously dour David Warner -- made this film a success . . . at the box-office, at least. AESTHETIC successes end up drowned and lost forever by what is perhaps the most poorly-written dialogue for a major Hollywood movie in all history. Director-writer James Cameron is to blame. His first mistake is to assume that one of the most famous and metaphoric disasters of the 20th Century, the sinking of the HMS Titanic on its maiden voyage, somehow needed a PERSONAL touch, in the form of a pair of adolescent star-crossed lovers of the Romeo & Juliet mould. As if there wasn't enough \\"human interest\\" in this story already!  His ongoing mistake, in terms of the screenplay, is to allow his sheltered, nerdy view of romance in particular and women in general (Cameron's a sci-fi geek, remember) to run grossly rampant. Example? ROSE: \\"You have a gift, Jack. You really see people.\\" JACK: \\"I see YOU.\\" -- Or -- \\"You're no picnic, Rose . . . [but] you're the most amazing, astounding girl -- WOMAN . . .\\" Aw shucks -- on it goes in much the same manner. It recalls any 10th-grade boy imagining a conversation with the most popular cheerleader in school. Once the ship starts sinking, the dialogue eventually consists of little more than \\"This way, Rose!\\" \\"Jack, Jack!\\" \\"Come on!\\" etc. It's an improvement, I guess. (My favorite bit is when DiCaprio is forced to say \\"This is bad!\\" after the Titanic collides with the fateful iceberg.) Again, I feel I must stress that I don't blame Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Winslet for Cameron's deficiencies as a writer.  Everyone hates DiCaprio, but he's undeniably charming here, and it's easy to see how he won the trembling hearts of teenage girls the world over. Also, Winslet works very hard to seem credible  (perhaps TOO hard), and she's certainly easy on the eyes  (regardless of hair-color).  They convince us that they're mightily infatuated with each other.  However, their acting talents only serve to bring to garish relief the horrible writing. The THIRD mistake Cameron makes is framing the love-story / shipwreck with a modern-day treasure hunt, in which a 100-year-old Rose is brought back to the site of the shipwreck in order to shed light on a legendary gigantic diamond that supposedly went down with the ship.  This plot-strand adds a good half-hour or more to a movie that's already too long. It's illogical too: Old Rose recounts to the modern-day treasure hunters events which she couldn't have been privy to.  Finally: the special effects for *Titanic* were groundbreaking, and the ship itself is a marvel to look at; but so what? It's sunk by the script long before it hits the iceberg.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|I love this album! No album this year has been in such heavy rotation as this one. They're up there with Led Zeppelin, Stones &amp; Who as some wild rockers. I can't believe it has taken me this long to realize how great a band Faces was...and I know music! Rod Stewart is one of my faves, but he was definitely at his best with Faces. My only complaint was that &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed (Live)&quot; isn't on this. &quot;Stay With Me&quot;, &quot;Pool Hall Richard&quot;, &quot;Wicked Messenger&quot;, &quot;Ooh La La&quot; are my jams. Rhino records has put together the definitive Faces album. A must own for 60's-70s rock fans.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Pros: Lots of fun, Mike Myers in his great Scottish accent (remember 'Hed - paans nuw!') is great as Shrek and Eddie Murphy knocks some rust off his humor in a movie where he is neither Disney'ed down nor allowed to play more than one part...<br />Cons: Cameron Diaz's stiff acting could could take the animation out  of a cartoon - who knew?  After great work as a stright-woman for Jim Carey in the Mask and Ben Stiller in Something About Mary I had high hopes, but I think she had too many lines.  Or maybe they were written down.  The music was over-produced light rock that didn't add much to the work.<br />Still highly recommended.
0060934913|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It gives a realistic view of the frantic pace in the big kitchens.
0316779237|4.0|But it does make for a great &quot;Intro to Sedaris&quot; you can use to get your friends and family hooked.  Also a far more convienient size to  keep in the bathroom for the holidays....<br />A great stocking stuffer for anyone who might think there is definately something odd about grown people prancing around department stores herding other people's children.
B000069CWE|4.0|First of all, I am a huge fan of LP, but it's nothing like Hybrid Theory.  If you hate rap or electronica music, you'll most likely hate this album.  I on the other hand love all kinds of music, and if it sounds good, who cares what genre you want to throw it into, and that's where this album is coming from.  <BR>One Step Closer, Place for my head, Cure for the itch, With you and By myself are my favorites.  No matter what anyone says, it's a pretty good album, but not exactly a Linkin Park album.
B000000WGL|4.0|Keith Richards, sly old dogg that he is, serves up some tasty morsels on this '88 classic, which fits in perfectly with the metal genre of that awesome time period. While \\"slick Mick\\" dabbles in maudlin ballads, this guy just enjoys rocking out completely - way to go, Keith!!<br />I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Wymann, also, a gent who played bass with the Stones for many years. To me, both Richards and Wymann know the value of what makes a song last - good riffs, raunch-teased lyrics, and garage production that would make the Ramones proud! <br />If you dig REAL rock, I'd check this one out...P>HAVE FUN WITH IT!
B00005OWEG|2.0|Apocalypse Now is undoubtedly one of the most memorable and powerful films ever made.  However, the &quot;Redux&quot; version is completely unnecessary, with the extra footage greatly harming the finished product.  As expected, the sound and video quality of the DVD is superb, but as for the movie itself, the original version is far superior.  If you are looking for a much better companion to Apocalypse Now, try &quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse&quot;, which is basically a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary of Apocalypse Now.  Not only does it show you a great deal of the additional scenes in &quot;Redux&quot;, but it's an absolutely fascinating exploration of the process of making the film.
B00005NWM3|1.0|This cd is a waste of your time, and money. Nearly every song sounds similar to the other & they quickly become repetetive. forget these guys, along with those other bands (Default) & (Puddle of Mudd). No matter what the magazines & tv are saying, believe me, THEY ARE NOT GRUNGE! <BR> bands like Mudhoney & Soundgarden(real grunge bands) have so much more of an edge that these guys really lack, plus they're not so \\"wha-wha\\" (feel sorry for me) sounding like nickelback sounds. <BR> Save your cash & buy \\"bad motor finger\\" by soundgarden instead, it's a classic.
B000001ELF|5.0|This one is the best one in my opinion.<BR>It is more rockin than the other three.<BR>It also has a few classic Ace songs like one of<BR>his trademark songs is New york groove.Rip it out<BR>is an awesome tune and it's my favorite song on here.<BR>This one sounds like Kiss and I think this is what Kiss<BR>would of played if they didn't split up.They could have<BR>kept going and played rock n roll and not disco rock is <BR>what they called it.So when they got back together to do<BR>Dynasty and unmasked,I believe they lost the sound they<BR>had.Why couldn't they keep the sound they had when Ace<BR>came back? Ace's sound made the band in my opinion because<BR>when they were trying out guitar players and Ace plugged<BR>in they said,\\"This is it,this is the sound!\\".It was the<BR>sound Kiss was looking for and that was the space Ace!!<BR>Buy this album now,what are you waiting for.It's a must<BR>have for every Kiss fan.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Long time Trek fan here too. As a child I would stay up late and watch the original series reruns and be tired all throughout elementary school. Then I recall a new Star Trek coming out called Star Trek: The Next Generation. I reacted adversely to it. But soon over time was a great fan of the show.  And it was the same way with DS9 but even worse. I hated Star Trek Deep Space Nine the first few times I viewed it. It was only until years later I deceided to watch it starting off in episode 73 with the introduction of Worf. I was blown away by how great that season was and got hooked. Eventually, I saw all the seasons and to this day it is by far my favorite of all the treks. I have dreamed of Star Trek Deep Space Nine coming out on dvd and now its here. I also want to thank Paramount for releasing Deep Space Nine on dvd. I cannot wait to get my hands on every season as soon as it comes out. If you like or even love the other Treks, please due yourself a huge favor and get into DS9. LONG LIVE DS9 the best of all the treks ..each season is easily 5 out of five stars.. I too pray for a Deep Space Nine movie !!
0517189542|4.0|I actually liked the book Little Women. I am not  huge fan of reading, but for some reason i really liked this book.  It was sort of boring at parts, but other time you couldn't put it down.  There was also very upsetting parts and even happy parts which made u keep reading and keep wondering.  An ex. of sadness was when Beth passed away.  It was shocking when Laurie asked Jo to marry him and she said no, and then he asked Amy to marry him and she said yes!  A point of happiness was when Meg delivered her babies!  I would recommend this book o others, but prefeberly women because guys will not enyjoy it or get enought out of it!
B00003CWNR|5.0|Director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m joins his formidable talent with novelist/screenwriter John Irving and the results are so pleasantly literate and dramatically satisfying.  I haven't read the novel so I can't compare the two but films vs. their novels' comparisions are almost impossible anyway since each media of expression is so unlike the other.  For one, film is a collaborative medium whereas fiction writing is a solitary pursuit. Judged on its own, the film works perfectly. It revolves around a young man, Homer (Tobey Maguire), raised in an orphanage by its doctor (Michael Caine) who loves him like his own son.<br /><br />Homer eventually needs to go out into the larger world and experience what it has to offer.  He has had problems with the doctor's inability to see the black and white of right and wrong. In his exposure to the outside world, by working in a Cider House in Maine, Homer too is forced to confront the gray areas inbetween right and wrong.  Delroy Lindo, as the crew boss of the Cider House, does a formidable job playing the pivotal character from whom Homer will learn the inexact rules for living his life. Caine and Irving deservedly won Oscars for their work.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00006LSM3|5.0|I just got my copy of Brainwashed (Amazon) and I cannot stop playing it!  The music is the BEST and the lyrics are what you crave if you are a Beatles (and/or post Beatles) fan.  A \\"Must Have\\" for those who appreciate GOOD music.  When I listen to this I have mixed emotions: happy to hear everything, but sad knowing we won't have anything else but memories from George.  Thank god for those memories and his music.  He has become my favorite of the Fab Four . . . after all these years.  Rest in peace, dear one.

B00006NSZ5|5.0|Eminem does it again with the song \\"Lose Yourself\\", this song is truly awesome. My favorite song on the cd though is on the bonus disc, and its Obie Trice's \\"Rap Name\\". I for one cant wait to see Obie Trice put out his own cd, this guy has so much talent it seems like a waste that he hasnt released his own cd yet. So Remember to get the limited edition copy of \\"8 Mile\\" so you can be sure to get the song \\"Rap Name\\" by Obie Trice. You'll be happy you did. Well what are you waiting for?....... BUY IT NOW!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is absolutely the best movie that I have ever seen.  I saw it twice in the theater and have watched the video at least five times.  I have now ordered the DVD and will continue to enjoy it.  The music is spectacular and each of the actors are so perfect for their roles.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This film is most definately on my top 5. If you have not seen this, watch it now! If you have seen it and did not like it.. well, is that possible? I loved it.
B00005JL2O|2.0|The first Austin Powers movie was hilarious.  The second movie basically recycled the same jokes, but I laughed anyway, probably because I was reminded at how good the first movie was.  It was comedy by association.  I'm sorry, but I can't give this third movie, Goldmember, the same sort of pity laugh.  There were a few mild chuckles here and there, but it doesn't even come close to reaching the bar set by its two predecessors.  <br />I'd tell you about the plot of the movie, but I couldn't remember what it was even when I walked out of the theater.  Beyonce Knowles did a solid acting job, but it was fairly easy to tell that she was acting in her first movie.  Unlike Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham in the previous movies, Beyonce doesn't serve as Austin's love interest, so there isn't any of the playing hard-to-get that viewers found so funny in the first two.  She's strictly business, which isn't very funny.  There's also a new character added to this movie called Goldmember.  He's a disco-dancing rollerskater who peels off and eats pieces of his own dry skin.  Disgusting?  Yes.  Funny?  No.  And, of course, there's Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Mini-Me, and all the rest of the usual supporting cast.  They each have their funny moments, but not many.<br />I know several screen writers, and they all say that every scene in a movie is supposed to mean something.  In this case, every scene should either provide some sort of comedy or advance the plot of the story.  There were several scenes in the movie that didn't do either of these.  They were just there holding the movie and its audience in limbo.  Everyone in Hollywood is under pressure to meet deadlines and cut costs, and it was very evident that this pressure played a major part in the making of this movie.  I'm sure the movie studio knew that people were going to see this movie regardless of quality just because the previous movies were successful, so there was no incentive to make a good movie.<br />I have to admit that I'm a big Austin Powers fan, and if they make a fourth movie I'll definitely go see it no matter how good or bad it is.  Unfortunately, there are alot of other people just like me, and the movie studios know it.
1565847032|5.0|This is a very articulate reflection on US capital and state policy which raises questions few if any people have answered in the popular western media.  <br />Chomsky has an amazing mind, and that is an understatement; in his ability to quickly connect real and often disparate facts to explain complex ideas--that tie the systems of power.   With a respectably high scientific experience and method he has created a formidable legal, philosophical and concientious case against the structure of capitalism in our country and laid out a daunting and unexposed history that every student or citizen should be aware of.   <br />The book is easy to read.  It is transcribed from his lectures over the years and is stuffed with accurate and easily accessible citations that allow one to make one's own decision over their legitamacy.  Chomsky's writing is translucent and a voice that is far too unrecognized... <br />That I am the first person to review this book scares me. There are reasons why wars are fought and planes go crashing into buildings--and in many ways it has nothing to do with the interests of democracy or freedom or &quot;violent&quot; religions.
0553212443|5.0|A Christmas Carol is about an old bitter man named Scrooge, who in decades has not showed any compassion to any living creature for uncountable years.  Ebenezer Scrooge owns a firm called Scrooge and Marley - Jacob Marley being his business partner and sole confidant who passed away years ago.  On the night of Christmas Eve, while preparing to retire from his busy workday, he hears boisterous noises and frustrated and frightened answers simply by Bah! Humbug's!  Marley's ghost, tied to heavy chains, appears in front of the stupefied Scrooge and alerts him that three ghosts will be visiting him that night and he must follow and obey them in order for him not to suffer the same consequence as his partner Marly.  That night all of the three visit and show him his past, present, and future.  Scrooge, alarmed from his future outcome changes to become the caring, charitable, and socially conscious man he was years before.  Christmas morning he shocks everyone around with his Christmas spirit.  Later that morning he gives Bob Cratchit - worker of Scrooge - the honor of being his equal partner in the firm and gives Cratchit's children the best Christmas they'd ever been the witness to.  <BR> I enjoyed A Christmas Carol very much, I give this piece of Charles Dickens work five stars because it is a heart warming, extremely well written novel that anyone and everyone should read in their lifetime.
B000001Y2U|3.0|Maybe its me but I didnt get the album. First Im always told what its about but one thing fustrates me that is. I cant hear what MM is saying. Maybe mr. Warner himself wanted to make that somehow translate to something bizzare and mysterious. Musically this album is okay. However its a bit overproduced. Not that I have anything against that but when it comes to metal it matters. I am no hard Core metal fan but I do sometimes like hard music and I often find Hard Rock and Metal best when its not produced the way this album is. The music gets its share but the producer who may have focused to much on the music and totally forgot the frontman. He totally ingores his role in the group and that is singing. There are lot of flaws in this album and I dont what to count them all here, one may be that this album contains to musch filler. However the artwork and the concept was a brilliant idea and some of the songs are excellent. So Ill Give it three stars.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Ok, people complain about his lyrics. Yes he's not a good writer. That's obvious. But you have to think about the people who actually listen to his words. He's a good writer to those who listen to his words. I honestly don't care for his words either but overall, the beats of the lyrics, the guitar riffs, the drum beats it all comes together to make alot of good tracks on this cd. If you are looking for a good lyrical band try Smashing Pumpkins or Our Lady Peace.  But I love this cd, not for it's lyrics but for the music overall. Sure, they're not my favorite band and it probably might have alot to do with the lyrics and Fred Durst himself. But that's not what's important. Just listen to it. It's a good cd.
B000000WFU|5.0|Adiemus is one of those albums that is meant to be listened to on an overcast day, with a warm fire and a cup of hot libations at your side. It's a collection of songs that is meant to stir the mind and let your imagination climb to new heights...<br />Karl Jenkins conduction work and the vocal presence of Miriam Stockley blend with the London Philharmonic to produce musical imagry of incredible depth and span.<br />Notable are the tracks &quot;In Caelum Fero&quot; (to which the reviewer likens it as the background score to a mating flight from Anne McCaffrey's &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; books), and &quot;Kayama&quot;, with their soaring range and pounding rythums. Also, the more mellow cut of &quot;Tintinnabulum&quot; with it's soothing choral 'lullaby', is a rich compliment to the rest of the album.<br />This is a pure guilty pleasure of a collection of songs. Don't get this if you're looking for techincal tinkering or something to compare to the Great Masters of Old... Adiemus stands on its own as a signature CD, and is something that any true music connesuer should have in their collection.
B00004SZBU|5.0|I have not purchased this album before in cd or vinyl but of the few other sacd's I have had the pleasure to enjoy, this one stands out as my favorite to date, even though this was recorded from the original tapes rather than direct DSD technology as some of my other sacd's.  I think it's the music that stands out and this sacd multichannel format is a great way to enjoy it.
B00005RY7X|5.0|When I buy an album and try to figure out if it's good, I boil it down to several things:<BR>Are at least half of the songs good?<BR>Better yet, are there a lot of singles, songs that stand on their own?<BR>Is the tone consistent?<br />While good is relative, those who have heard the album know where I'm going with this. <BR>All of the songs are good.<BR>Every song is a work of art in and of itself.<BR>This is the most stylistically consistent album I've ever heard.<br />This album is so solid in the context of what has to offer that it makes artists that I truly admire (Flaming Lips, Depeche Mode, Matthew Sweet) sound like they don't know how to put records together. It takes a pretty magical level of artistic forthrightness and confidence to expose a musical idea, develop it twelve consecutive times and never meet with failure.<br />Plus there are outside considerations. Rock was seemingly dead two days ago, before I had heard of Andrew W.K. It was wallowing in a pool of its own irony and vomit, a toxic tank of self-awareness. Even superficially exciting music was done tongue-in-cheek. This guy has reminded us all of what rock was designed to do from the beginning: boil blood, fry brains, and let the fluids fly. Hence the title.
0800141660|5.0|My college roommate and I watched this movie one night when we were in the mood for a classic.  It was immediately one of our favorite movies!
B000002LQR|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers got indeed slightly \\"sold out\\" after this cd, but it is still a funky masterpiece, unable to be ignored.  The album has contains an incredible energy, from beggining to end.  Ballads such as \\"Breaking the Girl\\" and \\"Under the Bridge\\" not only give depth to the record but also in a way let the album breathe.  I mean, after four or five energy blasting songs, such a sweet ballad such as \\"I've could have lied\\" balances the album.  There are two or three mediocre songs, that really don't fit with the rest of the album.  Besides that, I must notes songs such as the unforgetable, incrediblily funky \\"Give it Away\\", followed by \\"Suck my kiss\\" and maybe \\"Sir Physco Sexy\\" and \\"Apache Rose Peacock) (bieng one of my personal favorites).  Anyways, I really don't recommend this album for soft souled pop fan... no way!  Stay with that N*Sync stuff, that's for kids.  For a rock fan who love every type of rock in this planet (like me!) this is a must have album.  For rock fans who are too picky, I'd just want to inform them, this CD is waiting for you, buy it, you don't know what you are missing!
B0000669JL|5.0|Easily one of the greatest albums ever released. Bob Marley alone, transcended modern day music as we know it, and<BR>his music touched millions. Before him, reggae was but a small<BR>music, that was listened to by it's native people of Jamaica.<BR>However, after Bob Marley, reggae is know well-renowned the<BR>world over. These songs are so powerful, and this man's versitility is unmatched. His song &quot;Redemption Song&quot; may be<BR>the greatest song ever written;<br />&quot;Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery<BR>none but ourselves can free our minds..<BR>have no fear for atomic energy<BR>cause none of dem' canno' stoppa de time&quot;<br />His voice is so beautiful, and his lyrics are clear..unlike<BR>many reggae artists. Bob Marley was a 20th century living<BR>revolutionary, and many in Jamaica perceived him as a martyr.<BR>If you haven't listened to this album yet...I highly recommend<BR>it, because it's the &quot;Greatest&quot; reggae album ever!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I remember going to the movie theater with my mom to see Beauty and the Beast over ten years ago. By the time we left the theater, I was so amazed by the whole movie. It was very funny and had an amazing love story. I have to admit that Beauty and the Beast turned me into a huge Disney fan again.<br />I was so happy when Beauty and the Beast was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Ever since then, no other animated film has been given such an honor.
B00006LSM3|4.0|This disc, while not a classic like \\"All Things Must Pass\\" ranks up there with George's best work -- in fact, it may be his second best album.<br />One criticism of the record that perplexes me is about Jeff Lynne's production.  I've listened to the record closely, and it seems to have been mixed and produced with meticulous care.  If you loathe Jeff Lynne, I guess anything he touches you wouldn't like.  But I think his contributions are tasteful and add to the record.<br />George also alludes to his impending death throughout the album, but he never comes across as maudlin or overly sentimental, much to his credit.<br />If you like or miss George, this disc is for you.  I just wish they promoted it better so more people could hear it.
0066214122|5.0|This is his best since the Andromeda Strain!  I sat up half the night finishing it; a real page turner.  SIX stars
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think christina's new album is so hot.  its a different sound for her and i like this new christina.  you can get to know christina just by buying this album, and i mean the real her.  Her lyrics are deep and real and she has the best voice out of most female singers today.  i love songs like \\"Walk Away\\" because it is such a beautiful song and it show cases the amazing talent the best out of all the songs she ever did.  i also like \\"Get mine, Get yours\\" because it is a sexy song and has a catchy tune too.  \\"OK\\" touched me the most and was such a sad song and \\"Can't hold us down\\" was one of my favorite songs off the album along with \\"Impossible\\", which alicia Keyes did an excellent job writing and producing it.  \\"Infatuation\\" was probaly my least favorite because it sounded too pop ish.  Overall YOU SHOULD GET THIS ALBUM CUZ IT'S A HOT ALBUM AND IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT FOR IT AND WORTH YOUR MONEY!  its one of the best album of the year and my favorite too.
B00003CXFV|2.0|Having heard all the hoopla surrounding this film, I was fairly eager to see it, so when my father-in-law gave it to me for Christmas, I didn't waste much time.<BR>I was pretty disappointed, though.  The title character, who I guess we are all supposed to see as a sharp, tough woman, seemed to me little more than someone with such a chip on her shoulder she was bowing under the weight.  Her law partner (who was excellently played by Albert Finney) was nothing but kind to her, and she was constantly accusing him of trying to cheat her or of going behind her back.  He gave her a car, for Heaven's sake, and she was still treating him like the enemy.  Her refusal to dress professionally wasn't funny, either..it was an indication to me that she was a person who was determined to be rude to others.<BR>Since seeing the film, I have read more about Ms. Brockovitch and discovered that the story in the film is only half of the truth anyway.  Many people in the town she &quot;saved&quot; found that their settlements were much smaller than the settlements of people who were particular &quot;buddies&quot; of Erin's..not to mention the fact that the chemical everyone in the film was so upset about is certainly present in Erin's cigarettes in far greater concentration than it was in the water, and that that particular chemical has STILL never been proven to do damage to people.<BR>An interesting film, I guess, but certainly not one I have a desire to see again.
B000075BFK|5.0|The album is worth buying it has some good and bad songs like every album, I like Still Ballin', Thugz Mansion F**k'em All and Changed Man, my favorite of the album is Ghetto Star it sounds so raw and uncut I really am kind of uhh about disc 2, over all it's worth getting.
B00006CYAD|5.0|usually i dont care about the whole punk rock thing i used to think it was too poppy. at heart i love linkin park and red hot chili peppers, they're great to express feelings, but simple plan has this laid back crazy jump as high as you want thing about them. after school(which can drive a person crazy) i turn up simple plan and it totally takes away every worry and gives you an stellar crazy feeling. i would recommend this cd for anyone who has stress pounding on them.
B00000I0XW|5.0|Any Andrew Lloyd Webber fan has to love this album by Sarah Brightman.  &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; appears to be specifically written for her (hmm, wonder why)...and is comparably better than Michael Crawford's duet with Barbara Bonney on his &quot;Love Songs&quot; album.  While this is not a review of Crawford's album, I can't help compare Sarah Brightman's strong, sweet voice to that of Bonney's weak, strained version of the same song.  Just as I listened to Eden and La Luna over and over again, I also listen to this album frequently.
0312265859|1.0|This is my first Stephanie Plum book, although, not my first Janet Evanovich book.  It will be my last Stephanie Plum book, that is for sure.  The 5-star reviews I read talk about this book being funny.  All I felt was insulted that a woman could write another woman being so incredibly stupid.  Bumbling was too generous a word to use to describe Stephanie and her assistants.  Stephanie was written as stoooooopid.  When somebody who is supposed to be an experienced \\"bond enforcer\\" just stands there and lets herself be shot with her own stun gun, how can you call it anything but stupid?  I am listening to a Recorded Books recording of the book, and maybe part of the problem is the narrator's rendition.  Maybe the humor is lost when it is read aloud.  Maybe part of the problem is I did not start with the first Stephanie Plum book.  I don't know.  All I can say is that taking time out from one's life to read it would be a serious waste of time.  Unfortunately, we were treated to 8 inches of snow today and the library is closed, so I am stuck with this book on tape until tomorrow.  Even as bad as it is, it offers some entertainment while doing chores where a television is not handy.  I am only 60% of the way through it, but it is so bad, I had to express my opinion...especially after seeing those 5-star reviews.  I recommend spending your time on something else...The Loop by Nicholas Evans was superb.
B000001FDQ|5.0|the best guitar album that has come out to date and simply the one that represents the epitome of technical excellence, this record its not only technical tough as is full of amazing compositions that makes you realize that music is truly the magnificent form of art it is, something one tends to ignore or forget given the amount of lousy commercial music one usually listens to on the radio. <BR>This is the best Yngwie release along with the orchestral one he recorded, no one can match Mr. Malmsteen technically, his speed is untouchable to this day and his then revolutionary neo-classical style was so innovative that deserves his righteous place in history annals along with Hendrix and Van Halen when it comes to rock guitar innovation.<BR>Something else, dont believe what someone just wrote in a review about some dude called buckethead saying he can outplay Yngwie any day of the week, that guy for sure hasnt listen to this record and most probably is brain damaged, that bucket character is a cartoon and his guitar style not only is well behind Malmsteen but its also horrible help out by a thousand effects and certainly with absolutely no melody.<BR>So what are you waiting for? buy this record at once.
B00005JL96|5.0|I was not going to write a review, having read the previous ones and found them to be excellent, until I got to \\"storyboarder\\" form the \\"good ol' USA\\". Wow. What a boring world it would be were we all to agree an everything, but this person (whatever gender) is way, way out of line. Yes, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but this review is so offbase and borders on complete lunacy. Not one word was coherent, accurate or in any way representative of what the movie was about or what the writers intended to convey; which, IMHO, they did superbly. This reviewer needs to stick to hard, accurate dramatic movies and avoid anything that even remotely smacks of fantasy, intelligence, kindness, love, heart and wildly unique adventure, all of which this movie possesses in abundance. I loathe the taciturn, negative spin this person put on this new classic and  resented even more the hubris that was so evident throughout the \\"review.\\"  We live in a time when there is a plethora of disasters, horrors and calamities; if this movie, by virtue of it excellence, can transport us from our worlds and bring us to a beautiful place, then so much the better, and the people who worked so hard on this movie have attained their goal and brought a great deal of happiness and joy to those of us who appreciated the fine artwork and unique story presented for your pleasure, not for the censure of some lone malcontent. I make no apologies for my apparent bias and anger at this one review; I must also have my say and urge those who have not yet had the pleasure of seeing this movie, to please do so and then judge for yourselves how much validity and accuracy this \\"storyboarder\\" has...I suggest he/she stay home and watch CNN 24 hours a day 7 days a week and let us choose to escape and enjoy ourselves, if only for a brief time, and reserve his/her vituperative verbal vomit for more deserving subjects, than this gentle, kind-hearted and beautifully rendered film...we all need some fantasy and beauty in our lives.eauty in our lives.
0441009425|3.0|If Arthur C. Clarke and Bruce Sterling were forced to collaborate while locked in an ill-lit Gothic cathedral, &quot;Relelation Space,&quot; Alastair Reynolds' first novel, just might be the result. <br />&quot;Revelation Space&quot; is a big, gripping novel that bristles with feverish detail, lavish alien settings, and an arsenal of ingenius Big Ideas. Reynolds' highly stylized cosmological detective story is conceptually fascinating and becomingly moody; the author whisks readers from the ruinous, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;-like urban wilderness of Chasm City to the vertiginous, rat-infested corridors of the starship Nostalgia for Infinity, revealing a future history as interesting and plausible as that of Ken MacLeod (&quot;The Stone Canal,&quot; &quot;The Cassini Division&quot;) and Peter F. Hamilton's sprawling Night's Dawn sequence (&quot;The Reality Dysfunction,&quot; &quot;The Neutronium Alchemist,&quot; &quot;The Naked God&quot;). <br />Reynolds' novel is weighed down by some ponderous factional infighting (however sleekly integrated), and the characters never manage to achieve the sort of full-bodied &quot;Turing compliance&quot; possessed by the artificial intelligences that populate his story. Nevertheless, &quot;Revelation Space&quot; succeeds. Sophisticated and gritty, Reynolds' vision of a not-too-implausible far-future is an excellent effort that infuses &quot;space opera&quot; with the reckless surrealism of vintage cyberpunk.
0553382179|5.0|Marla Cilley's book is great for anyone who has lived in CHAOS (Can't have anyone over syndrome).  Her methods and insite are worth the read and the time to implement.

B00005AXEL|5.0|Easily her best album since her 1981 solo debut &quot;Bella Donna,&quot; Fleetwood Mac lead singer Stevie Nicks' &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; is an ethereal, enchanting return to her rock, singer-songwriter roots. After the disspointing release of 1994's &quot;Street Angel,&quot; Nicks returned to the now-reunited &quot;Rumours&quot; Mac line-up, released the critically-acclaimed &quot;Enchanted&quot; boxed set, and kicked a debilitating addiction to painkillers. Perhaps &quot;Trouble&quot; is a sign of her newly-revived musical career, as it spans songs written in 1971, to some spanning almost 30 years later. Sheryl Crow jumped on board to produce most of the album, including the magical &quot;Sorceror,&quot; the hard-rocking &quot;Fall from Grace,&quot; and the tragic &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; where Nicks sings &quot;...If only love would come again/It would be worth the ride...&quot;<BR>Equally enjoyable are the singles &quot;Everyday,&quot; and &quot;Planets of the Universe,&quot; the remix of which hit #1 on Billboard's Dance Chart. Past Nicks collaborator Sandy Stewart contributed the track &quot;Too Far From Texas,&quot; a country-tinged duet with Dixie Chick Natalie Maines. Perhaps the most vivid point on the record is the closing song &quot;Love Is,&quot; a sad, musically-intoxicating plea that invokes memories of past Nicks songs like &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Leather and Lace.&quot; Also guesting are fellow Mac-er Lindsey Buckingham, Macy Gray, and Sarah McLachlan.

B00003CXI0|5.0|This is a movie that lives up the it's reputation with regards to the storyline.  Casting is great, the story is great, it does the book justice.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|ET - THE EXTRA TERRESTIAL is a timeless and fun movie. This is one of those films you can watch over and over and still feel the emotion. It was acclaimed to bring out the child in us all - but really it is a celebration of who we are.<br />Directed by Steven Spielberg (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List), the film real star is not from this planet. Designed by Carlo Rambaldi (Dune, Close Encounters of the Third Kind), this little alien made history by doing the one thing that everyone else on this planet has problems with, making a friend. By making this friend - we as an audience learn about loyalty and love.<br />Standout performance by Henry Thomas (Gangs Of New York, Moby Dick) as Elliot and of course who could forget the screen debut of six-year-old Drew Barrymore (Charlie's Angels I & II, Ever After, Titan AE). Dee Wallace Stone (The Frighteners, Invisible Mom) and Peter Coyote (Sphere, Patch Adams) have some special moments too.<br />The real star is of course ET himself. Although complete made of metal and rubber and operated and controlled by over seventeen people, the little alien could emote volumes of feelings and really didn't say that much throughout the whole film.<br />The DVD extras are the best ever. There is two versions of the film - the original 1982 release and the enhanced 2002 20th Anniversary edition. There is even a separate version of the movie with the musical score performed live with a 200 piece orchestra by John Williams (Star Wars, Raiders Of The Lost Ark) at the actually 2002 world premiere of the Special Edition.<br />There is a 20th Anniversary retrospective and a reunion of all the cast where they talk about the film and its production. There is even a educational section on the planets in our solar system. The DVD is a must for every fan of science fiction and every person who enjoys a movie about love and friendship. I can not say enough about this film. Everyone should have a copy of this one. (11-22-02)
B00005JLWL|4.0|Some say it's a cheaper Matrix rip-off.  But in my opinion, if you liked Dark City, Blade, Terminator or The Matrix, you are bound to love this film.  Equilibrium gives you what many movies these days are missing:  actors who can act, action that kicks [butt], and a plot that truly works for a sci-fi film.  With a storyline somewhat similar to the dismal Gattaca, this film takes place post World War III, where emotions are suppressed in an effort to dehumanitize mankind and prevent a fourth war.<br /><br />Hats off to Kurt Wimmer for a well-written courageous script and some fine directing.  Christian Bale gives an excellent performance that only he can.  His emotionless and intense John Preston is eerie. Yet the depth he later brings to his character is genuine and sincere. You \\"feel\\" right along with him.<br /><br />Watching this film, I didn't really know what to expect.  It was slow at first, almost tedious at some points, getting us used to the lifestyle and laws of the future.  I admit I went in half-anticipating a copycat Matrix, but what I got was a ballsy thrill ride.  This is one of those films that gets better and better all the way to the end, without a letdown. It's not perfect, but it's a whole lot of fun.
B00006G8HX|5.0|STAR TREK III:THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK is an excellent addition to your science fiction movie collection. The commentary by actor/director Leonard Nimoy (Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Brave New Wolrd) alone is worth it.<br />The movie picks up where Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn left off. Spock has died, or has he? The movie is the race to get Spock's mind back to his body. There is a dangerous planet that is evolving as Spock is but the end of this Genesis planet evolution is its destruction. The cost of saving Spock's life is the price of the Starship Enterprise itself. Nimoy did  a fantastic job creating a broad opera with heart and soul and some real moments of friendship and loyalty. DeForest Kelly (Gunfight At The OK Corral) really steps up to bat with his performance and humor as the doctor with Spock in his head.<br />The movie has drama, action, space battles and most importantly - humor. William Shatner (Showtime, Miss Congeniality) has some very special moments of Star Trek lore in this movie. Each of the supporting cast even have their moments in the limelight. Nichelle Nichols (Snow Dogs, Porgy And Bess) shines with Mr. Adventure and James Doohan (The Duke, Load Weapon 1), really shows what a crafty engineer can really do. This film also introduces Robin Curtis (Ghost Story, Making Contact) as Saavik (originally played by Kirstie Alley (Cheers) in Star Trek II as the Vulcan science officer assigned to investigate the newly formed Genesis planet with the late Merrit Buttrick (Zapped, Stagecoach) as Dr. Marcus.<br />The most outstanding performance however goes to Christopher Lloyd (Back To The Future, Taxi) as the Klingon commander Kruge. His energy and excitement and evil nature in the role made a great nemesis for Admiral James T. Kirk. Watching the two of them fight is amazing.<br />The DVD extras include a great commentary by Nimoy and crew as well as several behind the scenes featurettes with great footage of the film as it was being shot. Also there is a great docudrama about the exploration and planet terraforming of Mars ad other planets. What real space science is capbable of and shooting toward. A very educational piece.<br />This is a MUST for every Star Trek fan and a simply good sci-fi film for those who like good vs. evil, friendship and loyalty type movies. Get this and you will love it! (11-26-02)a great docudrama about the exploration and planet terraforming of Mars ad other planets. What real space science is capbable of and shooting toward.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|I must admit that Moulin Rouge isn't as spectacular as some have rated it as being. But, for what it was supposed to be (a wild ride of color and sound serving as a backdrop for a simple romance story) this film has hit its target. It was not meant to be a historically accurate documentary representing turn of the century Paris. The inclusion of contemporary pop culture only makes this movie more lively and appealing to a modern audience.<BR>As for Nicole Kidman's acting, she was convincing at times but at others she fell slightly short. Stiff and overdramatic when she should have been otherwise. Nothing extraordinarily bad, and nothing to mar the film.<BR>I found the high energy pace of the film combined with modern elements to be engaging. Although you will find no enlightening ideas or underlying meanings in this film, it is very entertaining (which is what a movie should be, right?).
B00005NMXI|5.0|1000 words aren't nearly enough to descibe the experience of Townes Van Zandt. I was only lucky enough to see Townes live once and that was through a antibiotic haze following a particularly bad dose of tonsillitis. Although he was tired and reflective it remains one the music experiences of my life. He performed to a pathetically small audience in the seaside town Southport (the one they forgot to close down)England, entertained us laconoically, sensitively and uniquely and was very confused that there was a &quot;curfew&quot; at 11pm. Enough memories and down to business. This is a must for anyone who loves music, enjoys legends, appreciates genius and recognises something special which Townes undoubtedly was and remains through the music he gave us. His emotion is raw, his voice unique but ultimately his legacy his his song which runs the gamut of emotion which defines us all. Perfect music beautiful man. I was lucky and privaledged to catch when he was around and glad I stayed to thanked him. As Nancy Griffith's father said &quot;he is the greatest songwriter ever from Texas&quot; and ranks up there with the best. He had the pose of a gunfighter and the emotion of a poet. The tragedy is that he is not around today to share his success but anyone who leaves this deep legacy is well worth shouting about - whether in your cowboy boots and from Bob Dylan's coffee table or not!<BR>Buy this and spread the word.<BR>Thank you Townes, Thank you very much.
B000002J23|4.0|After the lackluster &quot;Tormato&quot; went splat and Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left the band, Yes made the unlikely move of adding singer Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes from the two-man new wave band the Buggles (of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; fame) for this 1980 album.  And while Chris Squire has referred to the Horn/Downes era as one of the low moments in the band's history, the one album that came out of it is actually very good.  Horn makes an endearing attempt at Anderson's vocal style (though he strains at the high notes) and contributes his excellent production abilities, while Downes makes a credible keyboard wizard.  Their new-wave sensibility helped perk up the beats back to rock tempo after the laziness of &quot;Tormato&quot;, and by throwing a touch of pop back into the Yes mix, set the stage for the band's &quot;90125&quot; success.  &quot;Tempis Fugit&quot;, keyed by a tremendous Squire bass line, is one of the great Yes songs of all time, up-tempo and up-mood; in the Boston area, this song got Yes its most radio play since &quot;Roundabout&quot;.  By rights, it should be on any Yes &quot;best-of&quot; album.  &quot;Into the Lens&quot; takes the Buggles song &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;, from their &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot; album, and remodels it into a Yes epic, adding a repeated, soaring Steve Howe guitar melody over a stutter-stepping rhythm section.  &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; is another strong piece that allows both Howe and Downes to shine.  &quot;Run Through the Light&quot;, a relatively straightforward rocker, and the proggish &quot;Does This Really Happen?&quot; are weaker cuts.  &quot;Does This Really Happen?&quot; gives Alan White a chance to play vibes.  &quot;White Car&quot; is an excerpt from a longer keyboard piece (played in full on the tour) by Downes.  Perhaps it's the lyrics that Squire thinks don't live up to the Yes legacy?  Most Yes fans, myself included, have never had any idea what theheck Anderson was singing about -- these lyrics are no sillier than any of Anderson's.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)

B000002KFJ|4.0|Being a big Sabbath fan, I often have a hard time deciding which of the Ozzy-era albums should be deemed their best (excluding, of course, \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" and \\"Never Say Die\\").  The top spot in my heart often changes, and this album often nudges its way to that honor.  <BR>One of the things I like most about this album is the discernible difference in guitarist Tony Iommi's tone throughout the album compared to the first five recordings of the Sabbath catalog.  Yes, the big heavy riffs are aplenty on \\"Sabotage\\"--no need to worry about that.  But Iommi does some fiddling he failed to do on earlier albums--he brings in a crisp, high-end sound, while losing none of the heaviness that hooked in Sabbath fans to begin with.  The album, from beginning to end, is as heavy as any Sabbath album before or since.  <br />What may lose some people is the absence of  neat little structures of songs such as \\"N.I.B.\\" and \\"Paranoid\\".  A number of songs on this disc undergo a variety of tempo changes, almost creating songs within each track.  But, of course, that is a Sabbath trademark that true fans got, and passers-by did not.  \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" begins with one of Iommi's best tuned down (one-and-a half steps) riffs, then turns into a lillting, percussion-driven jam at the song's conclusion.  \\"Meglomania\\" and \\"The Writ\\"  slowly build from introspective, depressing dirges into all-out metal beatings.  <br />The Sabs also display some clever production tricks--the sad,  acoustic \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\" is mixed so low, it almost forces the listener to turn up the volume--which is a fatal mistake for fans as the huge riff of \\"Symptom...\\" comes out of nowhere to smack us square in the face.  The only place the band slips up on this album is with \\"Am I Going Insane\\", which brings the album to a screeching halt, and really doesn't belong on this album at all--it would have been better suited for \\"Master Of Reality\\".  <BR>Though certainly not as ambitious or varied as \\"SabbathBloody Sabbath\\", their previous release, \\"Sabotoge\\" should be appreciated as the last great album the group produced prior to the band's demise a few years later.  Sabbath virgins would be better suited to begin their initiation into Hell with \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"Master...\\"--this album should be saved until you've reached the understanding that your soul can't be saved.
B00000272N|5.0|Along with Soundgarden,  Alice in Chains was the heaviest of Seattle's grunge scene, and their music was simply the best of the genre.  The opener, which is the haunting, stripped-down \\"We Die Young\\", is surprisingly fast for grunge music, while remaining very heavy and showcasing the best of Jerry's guitar work.  \\"Man In The Box\\", the second track, is a bouncy, slow song about a guy with a seriously bleak outlook.  The rest of the album is typical Alice, with elements that composed Dirt, their next and best release.  This is, in a nutshell, the foundation that made Dirt great.  It you know Alice, get this one and you'll love it.  Otherwise, get Dirt.
B000000W5L|5.0|If someone asked me to recommend to them the dirtiest, grimiest, sleaziest rock album to start a true rock 'n'roll collection, I would, without hesitation, offer &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; as a starting point. Exile is a snapshot of the &quot;world's greatest rock n' roll band&quot; at the apex of their career. No,the album does not offer the diversity of other classics, such as The &quot;White Album&quot;, or even the eclectic Led Zep treasures of the early 1970's--but, to me, that is what makes this album so special. You can't help but feel as if you need to bathe after taking in this remarkable album. Exile is quite an odd bird, as far as classics go. Despite the fact it is a double album, you won't find many classics amongst the eighteen tracks packed into the record (&quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; and &quot;Happy&quot; are the only true radio hits off of Exile). The album's mixing is also a bit muddled--Mick's vocals are buried in the churning mass of rock, blues, and country gems offered up by the band-which is a shame, considering his songwriting skills shine as bright as any other Stones album before or after 1972. It's also a blessing, as it serves to represent the group as an entire unit, rather than Jagger's back-up band. You won't find any remarkable musical feats on Exile. But you will find the Stones fully meshing their blues-based roots with their own sneering, strutting, sipping-out-of a bottle swagger. To contradict my opening statement, I would not suggest this album to Rolling Stones virgins who are pondering their initial exposure to the band. &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot;, and &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; are better starting points. But Exile is most certainly an excellent point to end the Stones journey, as they never again captured the whiskey-chuggin', cigarette-butts-on-the-floor aura of this classic.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This compilation of songs conveys the incredible versatility of McCartney.  When I first heard this CD I was impressed by the subtlety of the songs and the richness of the lyrics.  The slower pace of this CD gives the listener an opportunity to absorb songs that are packed with quality in terms of lyrics, instrumentation, presentation and variety.  The style is most definitely not a repetition of the past, though undeniably it is Paul, and illustrates the unlimited talent of one of the greatest songwriters of all time.  If your interest is focused on a hard driving type of music, this CD is not the one to choose. However, for those who would enjoy an absolutely fantastic musical journey that invokes thoughtfulness, contemplation and beautiful sounds and lyrics, this CD fits the bill. I think that this CD reflects the fact that the great ones stay great!<BR>And Paul was great!  No doubt about it!
B000002KET|4.0|The release of \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\" put the band in an awkward situation--had Sabbath come out with another minimally-produced album of simple riff-driven rockers, the band would have been criticized for failing to break out of the comfortable niche it had carved with their previous four albums. On the other hand, an adventorous shift in gears could risk alienating some fans, and give music critics fodder for dismissing the band's attempt at creating more ambitious music. What Sabbath succeeded in doing, for the most part, was maintaining their heavy-rock identity while venturing into unchartered territory (for them). \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\" offers the best produced and most accessible release of their Ozzy-era releases.<br />The band, admittedly, was in a bit of a rut entering the sessions for what would make up this classic hard rock album. When Tony Iommi came up with the opening riff for the title track, however, Sabbath was energized and back on track. <br />Lyrically this is, without a doubt, the group's finest piece. While not a necessity for judging Sabbath's music, it definitely adds to the color of this release. \\"A National Acrobat\\" and \\"Spiral Architect\\" show Sabbath had a collective brain (or at least Geezer Butler did, as he penned most of the lyrics for this album, as well as most other Sabbath offerings). In addition, the band incorporates keys for the first time (\\"Who Are You\\"), and adds strings (\\"Spiral Architect\\") in a more effective way than their initial attempt at classical sounds (such as the tail end of \\"Snow Blind\\", off of Volume 4). To temper the enthusiasm, it should be noted that \\"Fluff\\" is a weak acoustic meander that fails to hit the right buttons that \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" did on their previous release. <br />This album showcases Ozzy Osbourne's vocals more favorably than any other Ozzy/Sabbath release. It also lassos Tony Iommi back in--his guitar work does not rule this album as it does other Black Sabbath records. This is a good thing, as Iommi was not the most talented member of the band--the rhythm section of Bill Ward (drums) and Geezer Butler (bass)should be praised as the motor that propelled the band to the atmospheric heights the group reached in the early to mid '70s.<br />Highlights include the title track, \\"A National Acrobat\\", with it's twin riffing a la the Allman Brothers, and \\"Spiral Architect\\", which, while not representative of the Sabbath sound, may well be the the most well-crafted and ambitious <BR>song of the band's career. <br />Critics actually liked this album as much, or more so, than any other Sabbath album. But don't let that discourage you (!)--this is a classic hard-rock album often overlooked by music afficienados, but apprecitated by true Sabbath fans.
0151008116|5.0|What a refreshing book!!! Very easy to read and thought provoking. How often have we all experienced doubt over known beliefs and questioned accepted facts? Martel presents novel concepts without browbeating or lecturing and makes for an intriging book...very hard to put down!! His knowledge of animal behaviour is impressive as are his descriptions of human reactions.Understandable that he won the Booker prize for this novel!
B000002BFZ|5.0|Perhaps the best band of it's generation, the gritty members of Pearl Jam, with the release of &quot;No Code&quot;, released an outstanding album that actually started a mild, but noticable, decline in popularity that lasted the better part of six years until their most recent release, &quot;Riot Act&quot;.  Originally hailed as a great record by music critics, fans just didn't seem to get it at the time of release, and critics have unfortunately adjusted their hindsight to match the reaction of fans when the album first surfaced.  <br />With the release of &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, their third album (in 1994), the band reached the pinnacle of it's popularity--at the same time, the band was able to experiment, and even thumb it's collective nose at the music industry with an album that occasionally gave the finger to those who expected a certain formula from the band.  In hindsight, the reaction to &quot;No Code&quot; may be more of a delayed reaction to some of the less-formulaic offerings of &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, than a comment on the virtues of their  '96 release.  <br />&quot;No Code&quot;, overall, is a much more accessible album than &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, though individually &quot;Vitalogy&quot; probably offers more &quot;hit&quot; singles.  The spector of Neil Young has regularly joined Pearl Jam, but &quot;No Code&quot; serves up a number of Young-like tunes, both acoustic, and in the vein of his &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; jams.  <BR>The simple, but pleasing chord progression of &quot;Smile&quot;, along with the simple, but pleasing  lyrics and melody, surely could have complemented Neil's &quot;Cinammon Girl&quot;quite nicely.  In much the same way, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; is composed of a rather simple simple chord progression, but shows (just like Neil), that simple can be good, especially with the song's conclusion.  &quot;Off He Goes&quot; and &quot;Around the Bend&quot; are a pair of acoustic tracks Young could have written at the same time as &quot;Harvest&quot; or &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot;.  <br />Where the band may have lost some fringe fans was with the world-music leanings of &quot;Who You Are&quot; and &quot;In My Tree&quot;, which , for true PJ fans and true music fans in general, provide some outstanding percussion and the usual introspective lyrics that Eddie Vedder and company create with more passion and integrity than any other band around today.  <br />Sure, the band may have lost some fans expecting the next &quot;Vs.&quot; or &quot;Ten&quot;, but we can be pretty certain Pearl Jam wouldn't have it any other way.
6305537321|4.0|Yes, Alan Reed, the voice behind Fred Flinstone plays the convict that Holly sees on a regular basis. This is the only movie I know of where Mr. Reed has a part, though probably there are others. I finally got to watch this movie a few months ago when my wife rented it from the library. Had always wondered what the big deal was about, especially since I grew up in NYC during the 1960's and never really saw an Audrey Hepburn flick before. Also have always like composer Henry Mancini's \\"Moon River\\". This movie was also mentioned on Seinfeld, the episode where George tried to cheat on his book club by watching the video instead at some strange family's house. The NYC locations, dress, look and feel of that era bought back memories of my own childhood. Being of Asian descent, I am deeply offended by the Mickey Rooney character, Holly's Japanese landlord , a negative totally not PC stereotype with his beady eyes, coke bottle glasses, bucked teeth and phony Asian accent who adds nothing to the story and film. If not for this demeaning, senseless, and insulting character I would have given this movie 5 stars and given it as a gift to my older sister. Hepburn does justice to all the acclaims and George Peppard looks really great in his pre \\"The A Team\\" days. Other than that I would also have to say that the wild party is the best part of the movie. The ending scene with the cab ride, Paul, Holly, her cat and the rain is also touching and very warm.

B000003TB6|4.0|Me being absolutely disgusted with 99% of all Rap that I have heard, getting to know The Roots was a welcome breath of fresh air. I got this CD used (someone got rid of it!?) and I must say I was delighted. This is something that may well be called music. They not only rap, they also employ some &quot;choruses&quot;, and the musicians follow with taste and swing. This is eons away from the usual hip-hop - the dull, machine made garbage that is drilled into your brain all the time by the media. This is a living, breathing, ORGANIC experience that must be heard to be believed. Sadly, this is but an exception in the field. If more rappers took a lead from stuff like this, then you would have something. But I think many of them are just not talented enough, or brave enough to deal with an actual band, because this would put a musical burden on their shoulders. Believe me, achieving this kind of synergy, this chemistry takes a lot of talent, and a lot of work. Whereas setting up a machine for a monotonous beat is a no-brainer. I deeply commend The Roots for being brave, for being musical and for being unique. Get it.
B000002LCX|5.0|Johnny and Morrissey consider this their best album and I have to agree.  Most Smith's fans would probably say The Queen is Dead is The Smiths best album, but I would say this because of how much more experimental it  was than the previous three.  Sonically,  this album was pushing the edge of the envelope. Look at the first track.  There isn't one single piece of guitar on it at all.    The last track has him playing an insrument which he had found on one of the studio window sills covered with dust.  Last Night I Dreamt. .  . is one of their finest moments.  Like The Queen is Dead there is really only one really \\"down\\" moment on the album and that is Death at One's Elbow.  What a great album, one of the best pop/rock albums of all time.  I would even be so bold as to put it up there with Rubber Soul and Let it Bleed
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is one movie I can stand to watch over and over with my cousins.
B000002G7G|5.0|The album begins begins with a haunting \\"Candy Says\\", and as soon as you hear it you know this album is going to be one of those \\"sit and stare at the wall and be depressed\\" kind of albums. Lou Reed displays his unique writing style, and he gives you a taste for how creative lyrics can be. Bass player Sterling Morrison is at his finest, as well as the very talented Doug Yule and Moe Tucker who gloss the album over with their tasteful musicianship. The greatests songs on here are Candy Says, Pale Blue Eyes, and Beginning to See the Light. But perhaps Reed's finest lyrics on the album were pennned for the song, \\"Murder Mystery\\"- which ranks highly on my \\"top 20 creepiest songs I've ever heard\\" list. There is not a bad song on this album, and to be without it is a musical sin.
B00005NB0H|5.0|What can I say? Along with Live and dangerous fron Thin Lizzy, the is definitely the way a live album should be recorded.

0060523794|3.0|IBM is still in awe of Gerstner.  In the 1990s, the board voted to award him ridiculously excessive retirement benefits -- such as the use of a company jet whenever he wants -- so you can bet that his words will continue to be treated like tablets of stone for years to come, much as those of the two Thomas Watsons used to be.<br />The joy for all of IBM's competitors, and perhaps dismay for IBM's partners and employees, to be found here are threefold:<br />1.  That IBM will continue to run its entire operation as a portfolio, getting in and out of businesses as soon as they seem unattractive, which in IBM-speak means one, or at most two years of declining sales.  This is almost the exact opposite of Microsoft's approach.  To succeed in the IT industry, you need to show exceptional commitment to your customers and partners -- to demonstrate that they can safely invest in your products because you're still going to be in that business for five, if not many more, years.<br />2.  That IBM will continue to believe that open is good and proprietary is bad.  Before Gerstner, IBM believed in open, standard interfaces between products; now in Gerstner's world, it says it believes in open standards within products.  One wonders how long it will take IBM to realise that if it pursues this belief to its logical conclusion, everything proprietary will be stripped out -- in other words, there will be no added value in IBM products that you can't get anywhere else.<br />3.  That IBM continues to believe its best strategy is as an integrator of other firm's piece-parts rather than as a creator of the best piece-parts itself.  More than once in the book, Gerstner says this is where he believes the IT industry is headed.  He needs to look back at IBM's history.  IBM kicked off the desktop PC industry by being the integrator that brought together the piece-part suppliers Intel and Microsoft.  What is happening now?  The original integrator, IBM, is slowly withdrawing from the desktop market, while Intel and Microsoft increasingly dominate the processor and operating system markets.<br />I strongly disapprove of much of what Gerstner has left IBM with.  However, unlike one reviewer here, I cannot criticise him for avoiding the topic of IBM's WWII involvement with the Nazis.  There is a common feeling among the IBMers I talk to that, though the involvement was awful and reprehensible, it cannot be blamed on today's IBMers, none of whom worked for the company during 1939-1945, and none of whom have gained from that terrible episode.market, while Intel and Microsoft increasingly dominate the processor and operating system markets.<br />I strongly disapprove of much of what Gerstner has left IBM with.

B00000J2SR|5.0|1983 proved to be an interesting year in music. As a junior in high school, Rainbow finally hit my ears on a metal compilation cassette I had purchased in a store. When 'Street of Dreams' moved through my headphones, my musical interests found a different direction from the new wave music that permeated the radio. Joe Lynn Turner and Ritchie Blackmore are inseperable on this album. Listen to the gritty yet melodic 'punch' of 'Stranded' and then ease into the classically tainted keyboard opening of 'Can't Let You Go'. The emotional intensity of Turner's vocals and Blackmore's guitar are complemented impressively by David Rosenthal's melodic and haunting keyboards.<BR>I found myself lost in the emotion expressed in the album's two wonderful instrumentals 'Anybody There' and 'Snowman'. The rest of the songlist provides variety in a hard rock direction, mixing guitar-driven rhythms and keyboard interplay.<BR>Don't let the other reviews mislead you..There is much to be admired here from the album as a whole and even though Rainbow no longer exists, this CD always finds its way into my player.
B000069AUI|5.0|To tell you the truth I thought  \\"Yellow\\" was a joke. By adding a color to an everyday action, makes a song brilliant and meaningful? It wasn't until I heard \\"Trouble\\" that my outlook on the band changed. I purchased  Parachutes, and realized these guys have a vision that the majority of today's music industry lacks.  In my eyes, Coldplay is a legendary band in the living. They proved this to be true with the production of \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" Their lyrical content is so simple, but arranged in such a significant manor. The instrumental, unlike Parachutes,  reaches new heights. Their composition is unique and different in every song on this album. You shouldn't pass it by.
B000066NW0|5.0|Personally, I love every song on this CD.  Sure, her &quot;punk&quot; image may not be correct, but the songs really are wonderful.  Avril is not at all a Britney, or anything like her, and she actually has a pretty good voice AND she writes her own songs.  Personally I applaud Avril Lavigne for trying and producing a pretty good CD on her first try.  Give Avril a break, and just talk about the actual CD in these reviews (you're not reviewing Avril herself!)
B00006V9A0|5.0|After hearing most of Nirvana's songs, you'll likely want to buy their greatest hits. Well this CD gives nothing but the greatest grunge music of all time featuring hits like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Heart-Shaped Box.\\" Nirvana is one of the greatest bands of all time and they will aways live on...
B000002JBG|5.0|This is a winner for the whole family. It's got great beat and a fantastic message for all ages. I highly recommend this soundtrack.
B00006RAKP|2.0|OK, this review is partly in reaction to the fact that most gave this glowing reviews, which the music itself richly deserves. But if you've been following this guy for 30 years like I have, you expected a lot more. <br />Elton is at LEAST worthy of a 3 disc &quot;singles collection&quot; like the Stones got and, I would say, more like a 4 disc compilation such as the great Stevie Wonder got a few years ago (I'd be remiss to point out that both these pianist/keyboard players have had long, prolific careers--take note guitarists, of which I'm one  = - ]  ). <br />Sure Elton had some slow times and times he seemed to be following the pack rather than leading or at least running with it, but I still LOVE stuff like &quot;Empty Garden&quot;, the couple singles from The Fox like &quot;Chloe&quot;, &quot;Kiss The Bride&quot;, &quot;Part-Time Love&quot;, &quot;Lady Samantha&quot; and &quot;The Simple Life&quot;. What Elton deserves is a complete overview of ALL his singles, whether he's proud of them or not. The sheer width and breadth of the material would surely astound every reviewer and casual listener alike and Elton could truly be judged by the whole of his output.<br />I'll be looking for THAT box once Elton finally slows down the hits. RIP Gus Dudgeon
B00005JL96|4.0|Lilo and Stitch is a lively, funny animated movie from Walt Disney Pictures. The animation is not done in the lavish style often associated with Disney. The movie has more of a Cartoon Network look to it. This visual mode fits perfectly with the delightful, ditzy and happily subversive story of an unhappy little Hawaiian girl who befriends an equally miserable creature from another planet. <br />Stitch is banished from his home planet to a deserted asteroid for good reason - hes a mean little critter who was hatched in a test tube. Clever Stitch manages to escape to Earth, where he crash lands in Hawaii. The authorities from back home are in hot pursuit. While hiding out in a local dog shelter, he is adopted by the rebellious, maladjusted Lilo, who takes to him even though hes the ugliest dog ever. At first Stitch does everything he can to wreak havoc on his new owner, her sister and everyone else who comes near him. Over time, though, he and Lilo establish a bond based on their mutual loneliness, which, for Lilo, is caused by the recent loss of her parents and, for, Stitch, by the fact that he never had any.<br />The movie covers familiar ground  the importance of friendship, loyalty, etc., but it does so in a fun, spirited, and never preachy way. Its a movie that many adults will find entertaining because its hip and doesnt ram the cute factor down ones throat. Children will be delighted because the movie operates equally well on their level. Lilo and Stitch is great family entertainment.
B000066C1N|5.0|Spirit is WAY better than the lion king and the music of the lion king can't even top spirit's!!!! I think the movie people had picked the perfect composer and singer(s) for the music!!!! Bryan Adams is sooooo perfect. And the way that the music spoke for the horses, that is a tough thing to accomplish and he did it so great, it is like...WOW!! Me, i listen to music every single day, and just listening to \\"Get off of my Back\\" \\"here I am\\" and soooo much more...i want to listen to it again and a agian...it's like no music that you can listen to on the radio or buy on a cd (which you can). It is just so..well....GREAT!!! AWESOME JOB BRYAN ADAMS!!!! ^_^
B00005JL2O|3.0|\\"Goldmember\\", the third in the Austin Powers spy spoof series, is, like its predecessors, hit and miss. I thought there are more misses laugh-wise in this one, but that may be because the series' novelty has worn off. I suspect its makers know that. They've made the bathroom humor even more over the top. Of course, there is a big audience for such jokes, as the movie's huge boxoffice take demonstrates. For me, though, the jokes got stale about halfway though. Could it be that the writers were under orders not to go anywhere the average thirteen-year old could not follow? <br />I did thoroughly enjoy the opening sequence, which is a movie within a movie. Powers [Mike Myers] is a technical assistant on the set of a film about his exploits. Lots of major, real life stars have cameos playing Powers, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me, etc. There is also a delightful spoof of the classic musical, \\"Singing in the Ran\\", as well as a hilarious run confrontation with Brittany Spears. None of this has anything to do with the plot, which concerns Dr. Evil's holding the world ransom by threatening to crash an asteroid into the planet. The opening demonstrates what a comedic genius Myers can be, and if the rest of the movie were half as good, it would be a gem.  <br />Perhaps Myers himself would have been happy to have delivered an R-rated movie, for \\"Goldmember\\" comes as close as it can to that rating without actually getting one. [It's PG-13.] In many scenes, you can almost see the censors' scissors. The dreaded `R' would have theoretically eliminated much of the movie's core audience, but at least it would have been a more honest gross-out comedy. It also might have been a better movie.
B000070IXT|2.0|Visually interesting. Alas, for a plot. Someone breaks into a high-security biological warfare lab, steals a new virus, & just for the fun of it, as he leaves, he tosses a vial of the stuff against the wall, breaking it; then he tries to get away.<br />Fearing contamination, the high-tech super-computer that runs the lab's security decides to kill everyone in the complex! Not only that, it offs a few people in interesting ways; but you're left wondering - what for? Surely such a complex would be able to isolate the affected area? Why'd everyone have to die?<br />Next, a specialist security unit has to get in to discover what happened. What they discover is row after row of coffin like containers, each housing one of the now dead staff members. And, of course, they're all brain-hungry zombies just waiting to get let out!<br />This film is garbage. Sure, there's some well secquenced fight scenes, & they way the computer tries offing the specialist secutirty unit is also interesting. Obviously this computer is highly original, and uses its artisitc bent in coming up with ways to kill people.
B00005JKCH|5.0|When Spider-Man was released in the theaters, I heard many people say that they didn't know why Tobey Magurie was cast as the Web Spinner. What they don't realize is that Stan Lee originally conceived of Spider-Man as an average sort of person with everyone could relate. As Rosemary Harris as Aunt May says in the film, &quot;You're not Superman.&quot; Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is of average height, underplays instead of overacts and is just as convincing at playing a high school nerd as he is at playing a super hero.<br />Kirsten Dunst, likewise, is terrific as Mary Jane Watson. With her looks (and body), it would be easy for her to simply physically match the character. However she also manages to embody the character's vulnerability that she hides beneath her confident and charismatic exterior. Having seen very few of her adult roles, I never would have pegged Dunst for the role. However, having seen her in the role, I can't see anyone else playing it.<br />There was much talk about the special effects in Spider-Man as there always seems to be with blockbusters like this. However, to me, the casting is the true strength of the film. Maguire, Dunst, Harris as Aunt May, Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne are all perfectly cast and show that a film can have all the latest technical wizardry, but still must depend on its actors to flesh out the characters and make the audience believe and care about what happens to them.
0066214122|5.0|Excellent book. Not Crichton's best, however. Read Sphere if you want to read Crichton at his best.
6305508550|5.0|I want to start by saying that I saw (years ago) the original &quot;Milton&quot; short that inspired this movie. Ok..now. This is a fantastic movie. It is also proof that Jenifer Aniston is still funny, even without the &quot;friends&quot; writers. This is amazing and refreshing to see something that is so funny and so true to reality. You must see it.
0792839730|5.0|Until &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; assailed our senses &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; was the best war film ever made. It manages to capture the great complexity of Operation Market Garden and its foolhardy expectations while still bowing to Hollywoods penchant for delving into the characters themselves, and their own personal conflicts. Considering this film was made in the 70's it is amazing it retains such credibility in it's realism.<br />Simply put, &quot;If you don't love this film you don't know what a war movie is supposed to be!&quot;<br />The only negative comment I can make is about the cast. This film is perhaps the most star studded group ever assembled. The credits list like a Hollywood &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; for that time. Robert Redford's performance, while good, seems much out of character. Sean Connery just is not Roy Urquhart. Many of the stars appearances were simply extended cameos that drove up the film budget.<br />I can simply say: Buy this, rent this, borrow this.... somehow see this film; It is MAGNIFICENT!

B00005221M|4.0|This is one of my all time favorites, and when I began DVD collecting, this was the first one I bought.  It's inspired me in my writing in so many ways, simply by stirring up the imagination.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with the story, the Last of the Mohicans is about Hawkeye, a white man raised by the Mohican people.  The story is set in the French and Indian war in 1762, and follows Hawkeye as he meets Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), the daughter of a soldier, and must save her time and time again. That's a very BRIEF nutshell of the story.  I could go longer, but this review is about the DVD, not the story.<br />Those of you familiar with the book you had to read in high school--this version is quite different.  In the book, Cora is a very bit part, with an unfortunate ending. The director has taken quite a bit of liberty, so if you're used to that story, this will seem like something out of a parallel universe to you.  It's still really good and very watchable.<br />What made this movie, in my opinion, were 2 things. First, the Mohican triad of Day-Lewis, his father Chingachgook (played by activist Russell Means) and his brother Uncas (Eric Schweig) absolutely steal the movie.  The 2nd thing is that this could not be a more beautiful historical movie! Everything is authentic, down to the clothing and guns, and it's obvious the directors did not skimp a dollar on the making of this movie. The scenery is gorgeous as well.  It's shot in the mountains of Virginia (I believe) and long after I saw this movie, the wonderful scenery stayed with me. The soundtrack is amazing as well. I can't say enough good things about it.<br />So why only 4 stars? Well, the DVD version nettles me a bit. If you saw the movie in the theater, you'll notice that this version is a bit different.  This is the 'director's cut' which means certain scenes were expanded, and others were modified or chopped.  There's no 'original version' included on this DVD either.  You get the director's vision or not at all. Me no likey.  Also, the extras are extremely lacking.  Other than getting to pick which scene you want, or if you want subtitles, you don't have any goodies to choose from. That really disappoints me as a huge fan of this movie, simply because I *want* to see all the little tidbits that didn't make it in. Oh well.vision or not at all. Me no likey.  Also, the extras are extremely lacking.  Other than getting to pick which scene you want, or if you want subtitles, you don't have any goodies to choose from.

B00006M183|5.0|Whenever a new Pearl Jam cd comes out, you can never know what to expect.  Every album is so much different than any pedesesing Pearl Jam album.  This is definately the case for Riot Act.  It takes the band to a whole new level.  The lyrics are amazingly deep and the entire cd has an almost nautical feel to accompany the lyrics.  Much like the Binaural release, which had an astronomical theme to it, hints of the theme are heard throughtout, but it never gets repetitive or played out.  The tempo and feel of the album take a little while to get used to, but once you adapt to it, you will love it.  This album is one of the best albums Pearl Jam has put out to date.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Don't listen to the nay-sayers about the picture quality of this one.  I've played it many times on both computer AND DVD player and there were never any problems with sound, picture quality, or anything like that.<br />I'd review B&B for you, but you already know what it's about! There are 3 versions of the movie on this DVD -- the original, the extended (that played in IMAX theaters last year) and the Animator's Roughs that was shown in 1992 at an Expo.  They're all 3 great!  The extended just includes one scene extra, \\"Home Again\\" which is a big song and dance production.  If you like those in Disney (your kids will) movies, watch this version.  Otherwise you're not missing much by watching the regular version.  The Rough version was just fascinating to watch, and I'm so glad they included it.<br />On top of the movie, there's a ton of DVD extras, especially for the kids. There's 4 games and a sing along, and they are extremely cute! My niece and nephew both love them to the point that I'm sick of seeing Chip!<br />The second disk of extras seemed to me primarily alot of animation 'behind the scenes' extras, which pleased me. Animated films seem to always be a bit mysterious, and this sheds alot of light on the process while making it interesting as well.<br />This was the best DVD purchase I've made in a long time. It's also extremely hard to find in most video stores and retailers, so I suggest you buy it here at Amazon.  Disney is going to stop making this DVD in January 2003 (next month) so I urge you to buy it while you can! You won't regret it.
B00000DGSN|5.0|Man, what is there left to say? I wish I would have gotten this album years ago! It's probably my new favorite live album (along with Iron Maiden's Live After Death). It makes my live Led Zeppelin albums look like jokes, and infact I've come to like Deep Purple more than Zeppelin. The energy level here is one of the highest I've ever heard...WAY better than anything out at it's time (except maybe Black Sabbath...I'll always love that band, although DP is every bit as good). Deep Purple was crazy, check them out if you haven't...this is great stuff.
B00006L3S3|4.0|John Lennon was an intelligent eccentric mind whose brilliance not only verged on the edge of madness, but occasionally playfully crossed that line from time to time as if daring sanity to leave altogether. The Nutopia concept is a case in point as was his marriage to the thing that still has it's claws in his second son and in his work. <BR>This record is probably the most fun-filled of his entire solo careen (the 'n' is 'n'tentional). Mind Games, Make Love not War, or whatever gets you though your life is the anthem of the Lennon mentality: Mind Guerrillas, Mantras and all. Tight As$ is a fun bit of Meatle-ania that struts it's stuff with mop-topped delight, although a bit wordier than the mouth can generally swallow. Aisumasen slows the pace into a bluesier mood of regret, whether for some minor indiscretion or merely as a public apology for the continued presence of Yokel Logo we can only surmise. One Day at a Time is so gentle it makes RAM sound heavy. I don't carry the sardonic wit of jealousy that Lennon flung at Paul's work so I can appreciate it's subtle charms without driving nails into it's butterfly like \\"Wings\\". Bring on the Lucie is more of the same anthematic Mind Games mentality but flies the Lennon flag in a heavier breeze. And a cool breeze at that.<BR>Yo-yo Lowblow exhibits her vast wealth of creative input in the Nutopian International Anthem. The gist of her entire creative musical output is contained within those few seconds, played loud and clear for all to hear. The writing credit given is appropriate, although all monies obtained for her own personal abuse should be donated to every citizen of that Nutopian Mindscape.<BR>Intuition is a McCartneyish guilty pleasure that is as slap happy as it is catchy. Out of the Blue has the change of pace of We Can Work It Out, that seems more directed to the writing partner of that song than it does the Oh-no of his life. Only People is another hook filled song of fun and games--mindwise and otherwise. Iknow (I know) is more catchy pop while You Are Here charts its course on such smooth sailing seas that it is in danger of capsizing under the weight of its own wistfulness. That being the only real low point on the record leads into one of the real highlights, the most Lennonish of the bunch: Meat City. It's raunchy, crunchy and full of your required daily dose of mitamins and vinerals. Read the label for more nutritional disinformation.<BR>The bonus tracks are useless additions. There are better variations of these songs that others have bootlegged elsewhere. The remixing is questionable, changing the feel of the songs that John originally intended, so you might be better served to seek out the original version if you wish to hear it as it was meant to be heard. As it is I think that Soho Nogo should have her citizenship from Nutopia revoked.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Let's get to the point, this album is awesome!! Here is a     run-through of the songs.<br />1. Chic 'N' Stu-Very, VERY strange,but........no just strange. I liked it because it had that SOAD feel to it.<br />2.Innervision-It has a real kool Chorus and also that SOAD kick to it.<br />3.Bubbles-I like it. SOAD worthy.<br />4.Boom!-An amazing display of Serj's political views. I agree.<br />5.N - guns-Something about genocide.<br />6.A.D.D.-Very disturbing vocals. Sounds like something off of their first album. Your government is using you.<br />7.Mr. Jack-Spooky intro, kinda slow, but still SOAD worthy.<br />8.I-E-A-I-A-I-O -I got 8 words for ya..woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop.<br />9. 36-Short and Sweet. Too bad is isnt longer.<br />10.Pictures-This is one of the best song on the album. You just have to listen<br />11.Highway Song-Thought provoking. Just like a SOAD song.<br />12.F**k the System-Very interesting. Sounds like the first album in one song.<br />13.Ego Brains-The second best song on the album. Soft but hard.<br />14.Thetawaves-Simply amazing.<br />15.Roulette-Probably one of the best songs on the album. An acoustic masterpiece.<br />16.Streamline-The guitar is insane. Perfect example of SOAD's creativity.
0671688782|5.0|I was introduced to Dr. Welch's ideas and Holding Time 10 years ago, when a psychotherapist colleague listened to my story of despair and suggested I read  Holding Time. I located a copy and hungrily devoured the book in a sitting, and started using holding time with my  3 year old son and my 6 year old son. The results were immediate, long-lasting, and transformational. Dr. Welch's method has saved me and my family, and I am more grateful than words will ever express. Now, after 10 years, all the members of my family are thriving, and my oppositional, rejecting, phobic, bed-wetting, learning disabled older son has<BR>developed beautifully. He is a brilliant, easy-going, witty, high-achieving, capable, loving, cooperative, handsome, healthy young man. We still hold.
B000000643|4.0|The original material here is mostly top drawer.  This record is worth having if only for &quot;Genesis Hall&quot; --- one of Richard Thompson's finest pieces, whose enigmatic title seems to suggest that its period-setting lyrics are in fact, a heartbreaking catalogue of the worst sins of the whole human race.  Also for &quot;Autopsy&quot; and &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes,&quot; two of Sandy Denny's finest songs.<br />But the Dylan covers aren't even top drawer Dylan, and sound rather odd in British translation.  And performing Dylan translated into French must have seemed very clever in the wee hours of the morning when the idea was probably born; it doesn't make for an impressive recording now.
B00002MZ12|4.0|A little jazzy, a little bluesy, but essentially Alanis all the way. <br />Put in a single line, I think the great thing about this album (as with any good piece of music) is that seems to come straight from the heart. Alanis sings like she really means it.
0375414053|4.0|I was immediately swept into the book based on the fact that Kate was up in the wee hours trying to make bakery bought goodies look homemade.  (As a Southern woman, I am more likely to be found dusting paprika onto the deli-bought potato salad, but the similarities were there.)  I found that Allison Pearson could reach into the deepest fears I have as a working mother and do it with humor and understanding.<br />I found myself often chuckling and reading passages to my husband.  He also chuckled.<br />This book is being purchased for women on my Christmas list.<br />I loved it--and look forward to an agent provacateur bra this holiday season.

0316666343|5.0|This is a book you don't forget whether you liked it or not.  It produces a challenging look at what heaven is like and really forces you to think.  Susie seems so much older than she is, but then she's been raped and murdered, and can now see all. A wonderful, frightening, delightful book.
1586210912|5.0|I made myself st down and read this book one weekend, and it is probably the best investment I have ever made.  The book was extremely easy to read, becuse it captured your attention right from the start.  I am probably not the most educated when it comes to Economics, but this book explained so much to me.  It helped me to understand the difference between an assest and a liability which is something that i will use for the rest of my life.  I also really enjoyed the fact that it was written in a story form. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that isn't extremely educated in economics, but it will get you excited to learn more.  It is a good start for along life, and I'm glad I read it when I'm still yung, because I will use it's lessons as I grow up.
0385508417|5.0|I had a hard time putting it down. It is filled with perfect humor that everyone can relate to. John Grisham did a great job with all of the characters.  I sure hope this one becomes a movie.
6300216209|2.0|well it's not. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and i don't absolutely despise it, but I do strongly dislike it it. Why?, well, first of all, the story itself is very unoriginal. It's all been done before. Poor little rich boy falls for the actual poor girl. Parents dissaprove, and then, in the end, the girl ends up dying, and the guy mourns. I'm sorry, I just donot find any sentimental value in this film.There is no real chemistry between the actors, and the try way too hard to be all witty. There are too many cheesy lines between the two main characters for this to ever qualify for a great love story. Love stories are full of sincerity, and life. Not sappy,overacted bull. That's not called a love story, that's called a movie.
B0000640SA|5.0|I think Memento is very well done. The backwards thing is a little gimmicky, and it gets a little tiring just up until the end... but what an ending! It makes the movie for me. The ending is incredibly sad and I feel for the main character every time I see it, even though I know what's going to happen.<br />You also get a whole new spin on the story. While people can whine all they want about the backwards thing, the movie goes backwards because it has to. If you watched it in sequence, it really wouldn't have much emotional impact. So, the movie needs the gimmick. If that turns you off, you probably won't enjoy the movie. Go see the new Bond or something if you don't think you can handle a backwards-running movie. Don't get me wrong; it's done well, but some people will probably be lost right from the beginning.<br />Lastly, it's not all flash and no substance. Great performances all around, and the whole Sammy Jenkis story is really interesting and works well grounding the viewer between the backwards scenes. As for this DVD set, it's not that great. The commentary is boring; Nolan keeps justifying the backwards structure, but someone should've told him that the majority of the people who will listen to the commentary already agree with him and would rather hear about something else. The menus, as fun as some people might find them, are an utter waste of my time. If I wanted mind games, Chris, I'd move back in with my parents. Kudos on the film, however.
B000075BFK|5.0|I thought that being so long after tupacs death the quality of his remaining unrealeased work must soon start to slip. Im a big tupac fan and have a collection of cd, video's etc.. etc.. But the thing that strikes me about better dayz is that in my view it is his best realease yet.... why wasn't this released before. The lyrics and the raw \\"realness\\" of his raps are touching and show a lighter side to tupac. (Im thinking i was a little hastey to say the bestr album he has released), maybe just the realist and gives a true reflection on what pac thinks and feels. The Thug Masion rap espically. This album is mind blowing. Great, buy it whoever ya r. Even to the peeps who arnt too fond of hip hop, this is somthing else.<br />***** 5 Stars ...... yerrr, and the rest.<BR>Note: Im dislexic but hope you can read this
0064407667|4.0|I purchased this book for my 5 year old nephew.  The story is very well written and even though bad things happen to these children one always senses they will overcome all the obstacles so it does not affect young children.  It took a little coaxing but my nephew started getting into it about twenty pages in.  The story was charming and the tension builds wonderfully.  But the ending is such a cop-out.  For a writer who claims to want to be realistic with children I was disappointed that he would choose such a fake ending.  It killed it.  Nevertheless my nephew enjoyed it and understood the story despite the big words.  Maybe I'll get him the next one, see if it's better.  It also has very few images (though they are fantastic), perhaps 5 or so in the whole book, something which my nephew would have liked to have seen more of, and perhaps would have helped captured his attention sooner.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I totally love this movie!  I am quite particular about what I let my children (8,6,5) watch, but I cannot see any reason to keep them from watching this.  There is some violence, but it's all bad guy against good guy type and no blood and guts, no cussing.  The hero, the damsel in distress, the bad guy, all make this a true comic brought to life.  Enjoy!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Jones has a lovely, sensual voice, excellent pacing, and a strong sense of timing.<br />The songs on the album have a distinct flavor - blues jazz touched with country - that comes off beautifully;  my favorite pieces are probably Nightingale and One Flight Down.<br />The major problem with the album is that the songs don't vary enough in tempo and range;  a couple good up-tempo pieces requiring extended range would have punched it up and increased the impact of the slower pieces.<br />But an excellent album and an excellent artist.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I loved this. Its was so fun. it has tunes you sing with and funny crockery, too. The teapot man is my favorlite. Deserves 6 of 5 stars!
B000006YYM|5.0|This was Gentle Giant's first &quot;full-concept&quot; album, and it was very impressive in its day. The story of the unnamed, newly elevated ruler, his initial aspirations for his people and his nation, his burgeoning love of power and rationalizations for his excesses, and his descent into rigid dictatorship was ambitious and riveting -- if one took the effort to follow it carefully.<br />The music was very much of the kind GG was known for, both before and after this album: complex, experimental and challenging, but never so outre as to alienate the listener who approached it with an open mind and ear.<br />The Power And The Glory wasn't Gentle Giant's high water mark -- I'd award that distinction to Octopus -- but it was an outstanding work issued at a time when a great malaiase had begun to creep over popular music. Even today, nearly thirty years since its release, it stands well above the mass of small-group contemporary music -- and it's an important foundation stone for much that followed it.
B00006GA48|5.0|On this, their third album, Grand Funk Railroad's own unique sound became fully evolved. The band had started with re-written and refined material from their days as another group when they debuted as GFR in 1969 with &quot;On Time.&quot; With their second album, &quot;Grand Funk,&quot; the band gave birth to a unique entity of music: a hybrid of edgy hard rock, quirky pop, and soulful blues. However, their music, though catchy, was still very infantile. It was clear that the band was still learning to crawl. With &quot;Closer to Home,&quot; they officially carved their niche into the musical world with a vengeance. The pulsating rhythms of Mel Schacher's bass, the primal yet deeply spiritual melodies of Mark Farner's guitar, and the much-underrated beat of Don Brewer's drumming came together to paint a picture of how society should be.<br />The songs, though sometimes mistaken for party fare, are very conceptual. One the A Side, the band examines the world as it was in 1970 (and still is today): a cold place where humanity is in danger of being wiped out by its own desires. On the B Side, Mark Farner's lyrics shift from an observation to a warning: that our best chance for survival as a species depends on adopting an attitude of peace, love, and mutual respect and tolerance for one's neighbors, be they friend or foe. This idea is slowly built upon until it reaches a head with the band's magnum opus: &quot;I'm Your Captain,&quot; a ten-minute tour de force of quiet yet explosive rhythms, and some of Farner's best lyrics. The band spends the last half of the song pleading with society to find its way back to the light (accompanied by a flutist and a string section, a first for the group).<br />What really makes these songs stand out from Farner's earlier efforts is more of a devotion to words with a meaning. In the past, songs that touched upon Farner's personal philosophy were often outnumbered by songs that had more of a pop feeling to them, as far as lyrics were concerned. His abilities as a songwriter matured, so that even on songs like &quot;Aimless Lady,&quot; the words and music do a better job of blending into a symmetrical whole. This idea is carried into the next song about a broken releationship: &quot;Mean Mistreater.&quot; This song is entirely about rhythm, as Mark Farner takes off his guitar and trades it for an organ. Combined with Schacher's bass and Brewer's fiery percussions, you won't even notice that the guitar is gone. As for the rest of the songs, there is a purity to the band's musicianship that is more refined than it was on earlier albums. Don Brewer manages to keep the beat without hitting the cymbals every five seconds, and both he and Mel Schacher feed Mark Farner a rhythm which Farner uses to sculpt magnificent chords on his guitar: every bit as edgy as the last album, but with just the right amount of pop. And as for Mel Schacher: if his bass doesn't get your feet tapping (especially on &quot;Nothing Is The Same&quot;), you might be legally dead. All in all, the band delivers more than just a message that people must learn to live in harmony. They're saying: &quot;Look out, world. We've learned how to rock, and we're not taking any prisoners.&quot;
B00006LJ72|5.0|Taken from Memory of Trees (circa '95) ... Nothing's even near!<br />A divine blessing to us all from heaven.<br />I can't play it often enough!!!! For a major motion picture to include this track for a love song, will sink the hook in the audiences' heart. Don't pass it by - I assure you!
B000068TPN|4.0|Real account of someone who actually was there to show it like it is. Watch the movie, then read the book. You will enjoy both. Mel Gibson words 'I shall not leave anyone behind' is so powerful and then he kept his word. I like to see patton say that. Anyways, this movie shows the family as well as those who fought so far away. Who wants to send death notices to their wives? No one but it needs to be done and this movie shows the emotions that go thru their heart of hearts. Were they prepare for whats to come?  No but they are men and knows how to fight with honor and fought as solders, not cowards. I recommend this movie highly althought one viewing is enough for me to last a lifetime. I cried at the end and i don't want to go thru it again....even more tearjerking then 'Saving Private Ryan' and i cried at the end of that one too.
B00005ASHM|5.0|There are few in the musical world, myself included who could overlook the exquisit genius that is Pet Sounds. Rubbersoul (which in my opinion was as close as the beatles ever got to perfection) inspired brian wilson to pull out every little piece of his creative talent to provide us with one special moment in music (13 if u count songs individually). Starting With Wouldn't it be nice we get a musical ride lasting all the way through until caroline no.<br />Pet Sounds and the followup song Good Vibrations would never have existed had Brian Wilson not had the emotional problems which led to him leaving the touring band. This allowed him to spend his time and creative energy proving to the world that he was the one true Rock And Roll genius and his talents were as unique as his personality. No one could ever do what Brian Wilson did on this one album.<br />This album I believe is more of a brian wilson solo album than it ever was a beach boys album has shown that even in the 60s when pop/rock music was still in its infancy that something can be created that the world would still marvel at 36 years after its original creation.
B000065U1N|4.0|What can i say, if u like shooting it up attack like the end of saving private ryan, then u would love this movie. It capture exactly what had happen and very convincable too. One thing i find not too convincing is that too many bullets were misses from both side but i assume that how it happen. It's sad to go in there without full support or intelligence to help. Do milatary personal say 'wupp!!' all the time? i didn't hear any of that in other war movies. So do i recommend this film for viewing? WUP!
B00006LFGD|5.0|Unbelievably awesome!  Without question this is one of the best albums I have ever owned in my entire music-listening years.  What an awesome experience to listen to some of the greatest singers of today (and yesterday) singing duets with THE greatest singer of all time.  WOW!!!  Words cannot describe what a treat this album is!  Once you put it into your CD player you won't want to take it out.  My only one complaint is (as shared by a number of other reviewers)I am disappointed that there wasn't more than just two new recordings.  For those of us who are die-hard Striesand fans, we already have most of these tracks on her previously recorded albums.  Nevertheless, it is still a delight to the ears!!!
B00005JKNF|5.0|Not truly a murder mystery, but a terrific social commentary on English life in the early 1930s.  Yes, as an earlier reviewer noted, the accents can be difficult for Americans to follow all the time (but after all, the characters are ENGLISH). Don't let that put you off - it's superbly acted and never less than fascinating.<br />I usually only make it through a few minutes of most director/producer/writer commentary tracks, but don't miss the one on this disk by the writer, Julian Fellowes.  It was unusually informative and the man really knows how to tell a story.
6301969251|5.0|the greatest story ever told is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. it is certainly my favourite film(along withking of kings, the 1961 version). but its a shame hollywood isn't really a Catholic cultural city, or this would've won best picture, best actor in a lead role(max von sydow) and best actor in a support role(charlton heston). max von sydow as Christ is brilliant. his sensitivity at Lazarus' death is a real great moment in movie making history. Also, Heston gives the most powerful and best performance of john the baptist ever. not only were the performances spectacular, but also the music. the Via Dolorosa scene, is definitely a great moment in moviemaking history, but also, the scene showing bar armand(van heflin)the cripple made well(sal mineo) and old aram(ed wynn) proclaiming the news that Jesus resurrected Lazarus is an all time classic and is the best moment of the film. the song \\"alleluia\\" i beleive should've atleast been nominated for best song. <br />this is one of the true classics, which is true to the Bible, and is highly recommended.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I don't need to repeat the story about Beck's now gone girl friend as his muse...so let's concentrate on the album proper.<br />This latest Beck album combines diverse musical elements in a wholly satifying manner. First, he takes an artwork and subject cue from Bjork and, circa Homogenic, Bjork-atizes the cover and interior. Bjork, as you may know, wrote Homogenic after a bad breakup with a DJ boyfriend. But this is all Beck's brand of atmospherics (and his Radiohead famed producer's). Where Bjork's Homogenic evokes anger, Beck's Sea Change chooses resignation, and each song explores that theme to some extent. Second, I hear lots of Radiohead in the mix, which isn't surprising. I only occasionally get the sense of deliberate injection of that signature sound -- In one track \\"Lonesome Tears\\" I hear that mixed with some melodies reminiscent of the Beatle's Sergeant Peppers (the stairstep progressions). Maybe Beck had been playing \\"When I'm 64\\" and listened to the whole album. Third, Some of Beck's delivery reminds me of Rufus Wainwright's flat nasal detached vocals (listen to \\"Milk and Chocolate\\" from his Poses album and compare). Beck has absorbed a compelling mix of influences. Lastly, I hear Nirvana's \\"Something in the Way\\" from Nevermind in the delivery style, too.  Listen to Kurt Cobain's vocals then listen to Beck's...similar, eh?<br />So, after that deconstruction, why should you buy this CD? If you like softer edge, more intelligent lyrics, more melodic vs. noise, instrospective rock, you'll like this album. Very well crafted. After listening to Sea Change, you might feel sorry for Beck's breakup.
B00006LHYC|5.0|This is the first time I'd heard of Laura Pausini.  I just happened to be browsing for some new music when I came upon this CD.  I was quite simply blown away by the sound samples.  I purchased it and now my co-workers are hooked.  Although there are similarities with Celine Dion, Laura Pausini is more understated--there isn't any of the &quot;let me show you how loud and long I can hold a note&quot; diva action going on and she'll appeal to a younger audience as well as us older folks.  Her style is more natural and up tempo. Laura definitely deserves a lot of play time on the radio.
0671721720|5.0|This book was even better than the first in the series.... it was awesome.  This was the second book I read by David Weber (On Basilisk being the first) and I keep repeating myself but it was just a non stop ride of thrilling daring do.  She is stuck with a planet of zealously religious chouvanistic poligimists and she must defend them from another planet of even more zealous religious nuts, who are worse than the Taliban ever were.  And she has to do it against odds that would make a 99 to 1 horse bet look like good odds.<br />... It's worth your time.
B00005A46T|4.0|First of all, I want to make something clear. Slipknot is NOT mere metal. They are metalcore. (They are not intense enough to be grindcore, so I hesitate to say that they \\"grind\\".) They are not heavy metal, they are not nu metal, they are not thrash metal; they are metalcore, and it is nothing like your MTV metal.<br />That said, with its loud, down-tuned guitars, this album is heavier than their self-titled, but it's not quite as fast. However, creatively, it is more refined, with some better tunes and less chaotic noise. Don't worry, though, the industry hasn't killed them despite their unlikely popularity: They are as angry and as frustrated as ever and do not hesitate to make this known, through the gutteral yelling, blistering drums, and crushing guitars.<br />The only thing lacking is the lyrics. They're not poetic or creative at all; just full of anger and bitterness, the motif of any metalcore band. But I don't think this genre is known for the best lyrics, so it suits me just fine.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's uplifting new album is, without a doubt,a winner. After all the critical acclaim they got with \\"Parachutes\\", the british band has managed to surpass such a hit, bringing out a poignant record drenched with powerful songs as well as the emotive ballads they're used to make. How difficult it must be for a band to do that? Well, very.<BR>Compared with \\"Parachutes\\" \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" is superior in various aspects: Is evident that the band has put more effort in the songs, the result is a more complex sound. Also the acoustic guitars are not a constant anymore, proof of that are songs with great guitar riffs (\\"Politik\\", \\"Daylight\\", \\"A Whisper\\"). The other difference is the mood of the record, there is happiness here (\\"Green Eyes\\", \\"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\\") so you don't need a kleenex everytime you listen, like in \\"Parachutes\\" (that's good, as much as I like to listen to sad tunes). <BR>But you still know is Coldplay.<BR>Chris Martin's voice is always communicating heartfelt emotions, moreover contributing with the piano in several songs. Many bands would kill to have someone as good lyricist and musician as him.<BR>There's a balance on this record in which songs flow naturally: \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Warning Sign\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" being my favourites and with \\"Clocks\\" and \\"In my Place\\" being very catchy.<BR>Lyrically emotive and sometimes rebel (\\"Politik\\",\\"Rush of Blood...\\"); musically with more textures helped by strings, shivering guitars and great choruses making this record a bliss to the ear. The music is very dynamic, so you don't get bored or fall asleep, far from it, you want more.<BR>In a market satured with pop, hip-hop, and nu-metal nonsense, \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" shines with own light showing these guys have a yet brighter future. I can't get enough of this CD!
6304341849|5.0|E.M. Forster's novel  \\"Maurice\\" and  James Ivory's film version have both taken heavy criticism for their sentimentality and lack of realism. It's true the suggestion that Maurice (James Wilby) and Alec (Rupert Graves) will live happily ever after strains credulity, particularly considering that they live in Edwardian England in the shadow of Oscar Wilde's disgrace. But really, are Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie any more believable, or any less purply drawn, than Maurice and Alec? Alec climbing into Maurice's bedroom window is every bit as thrilling for some audiences as Rhett sweeping Scarlett up the staircase is for others, and neither couple should be despised. Also, the performances of the very talented (and very straight) Wilby and Graves deserve all the praise they can get, as does that of Hugh Grant as a far more conflicted young gay man.
B00000ILDF|3.0|... the ALIEN 3 has been bashed for many years for being simply that; an inferior follow-up to two great first installments in the saga.  Certainly, everyone can concede that it would be extraordinarily difficult to match up to the sheer scare power of ALIEN or ALIENS, and ALIEN 3 deserves a second look on its own merits.<br />That said, this outing finds Lt. Ripley crash-landing onto a prison world, where she faces a cadre of lustful killers who -- in an odd twist of fate -- are already too late: a seed has been planted inside her, and it's her worst nightmare come true.  Ellen Ripley carries an infant alien, the next generation of horror, and thus ensues the race against time to battle both a full-size predator on the loose, the one germinating inside our heroine, and the evil forces of the company who've learned that there's still an alien out there for them to the world of business.<br />In one tidy little package, ALIEN 3 is a well-paced allegory for all that Ripley has feared.  Standing alone, it's a nice little film -- not a great one -- that probably has been stripped by fandom of its ability to be just that: one nice little scare.  Being part of a trilogy (well, until the next installment anyway) where the first two parts equal a sum far greater than ALIEN 3 could match, its swallowed up like prey.
B00006G8LB|4.0|The end result of a campaign that lasted almost 20 years, the movie was well worth the wait.<br />I noticed Willem Dafoe was doing an imitation of Jack Nicolson's \\"Joker\\" from Batman, but what can you say.<br />If you're going to steal, steal from the best!
B000002JS0|5.0|I had the good fortune of seeing AC/DC perform many of the songs from High Voltage live in concert ('77) at Comiskey Park in Chicago with Foreigner, Frank Marino & Mohogany Rush & Aerosmith, and I, and perhaps many others there, felt AC/DC won hands down.  It was a great performance, and for those of you who think Bon Scott's voice was a trick of computer engineering in the studio, think again.  A powerful singer with a great band to back it up.  This album highlights what most Bon Scott fans love most about AC/DC, or the old AC/DC I should say.
B0000669JL|5.0|This cd proves once again that Bob Marley is the true king of reggae!  Every component of the cd is better than ya could imagine!  Basically every famous reggae hit ever is on this album. Two words of advice: BUY IT!
B00006F83Y|5.0|Clearly, this is one of the best albums of the year.  It's motley blend of the best rocks sounds over the last 20 years make this album an auditory treat.  There is music for any type of mood on any day.  From the neckbreak speed of heavy Song for the Dead to the acoustic chant of the Mosquito Song, this is an extraordinary album in an era dominated by the cheap sampling that is current in hip-hop and crappy J-lo music.
B00004TKAQ|5.0|i liked the recording, and this is one of qms' best performances.  this release was remastered by EROC (who seems to be doing all the remastering on the repertoire label).  he used to be drummer in the german progressive band grobschnitt, who's solar music live is considered one of the best live progressive recordings ever.  so, it's a bit ironic that one great performer has remastered another great rock performance.  the booklet in this cd is very informative.  i highly recommended this cd release.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is one of those albums that fully utilizes the 80-min capacity of a music CD - over 78mins of playing time! <br />There is much to offer (20 tracks) in this album, but in NO way has quality been compromised by quantity. The music is very well-produced, complementing perfectly with Christina's amazing voice. Many of the tracks are worthy of becoming singles. Some tracks like \\"Beautiful\\" have strong melody and lyrics, these instantly grab your fancy...while others like \\"Fighter\\", with its loud, rock sounds may sound rather harsh at the first hearing, however, with repeated listening, the vigor of the music eventually catches on you. If realism is something to be desired of, in songs like \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", \\"Stripped\\" interludes and \\"I'm OK\\", Christina offers some realistic perspectives of life (people who put her down, family abuse). In fact, this album has covered several genres of music - latin, rock, r&b, gospel, soul, it could probably lead to some critics arguing for the loss of focus. Nevertheless, the crux of the matter is whether Christina has coped with the different styles competently. Fortunately, she appears to do so...very well. On the whole, the variety certaintly lends much dynamics to the flow of the album.<br />This album is highly recommended for anyone who likes powerful vocals. If you are not opposed to powerful voices (i.e. loud, bombastic, melismatic singing) you would have no problem with Christina's voice here. People who enjoy this album are possibly fans of other vocal divas like Whitney, Mariah, Celine. Her voice especially shines in the song \\"Walk Away\\". Hearing her transit from a low, purring voice to an emotional one at the chorus is truly fascinating. Do not, however, be quick to deduce Christina will be shouting, yelling for all of the tracks. In \\"I'm OK\\", she gives a refreshingly subdued, raw performance at the verses. <br />Although the image of Christina has been leaning towards that of 'trashy', it would be a regret to penalize such a well-done album on that irrelevant factor. Stripped truly deserves the 5 stars!

B00006SFBD|5.0|Why do I say that? It just seems to happen that musicians change as they age and their careers progress. New circumstances, new goals, new reasons for doing things, boredom, laziness, and other people's opinions show up in their music. It never fails. Sooner or later that world-beating, life-changing band you love so much will come out with something that disappoints you. (Ironically, that's usually the same time a band becomes popular.) Casual listeners can't tell the difference, but you know deep down when something is not up to snuff. <br />The annointed one who wrote MR, MAYH, SL and BWP still has the same name but he must be different inside. I heard him evolving through each majestic miracle in the Opeth catalogue. The stately harmonies and counterpoint of Orchid and Morningrise were Akerfeldt's string quartets, demonstrating that his first vision was delicate and intricate, not head-banging.<br />Ensuing works like My Arms, Your Hearse and Still Life brought on the full orchestra. Akerfeldt started to deftly deploy irresistible rhythms and snaky riffs to quicken your pulse. His impossibly orginal music surprised you and awed you and convinced you that Opeth was the best band you've ever heard, blessed with a sense of melody so rare you cried at the sound of its beauty. This was a band for the ages. Nothing else came close.<br />Blackwater Park polished the Opeth sound to a shiny finish, well-produced, with satisfying aural depth and cohesion. But BWP revealed the first clues that the band was slowly but steadily travelling away from their trademark distinctiveness toward the more ordinary. <br />There's no debate that Akerfeldt is a wonderful guitarist, composer and singer. Of special note is the way he weaves painstaking layers of tracks that remind you of full-bodied guitar orchestrations by Brian May and James Hetfield. Akerfeldt takes this technique to new heights of glory and power. He's in full command and always perfect.<br />Far from being a simple CDto rate, Deliverance has some of the best Opeth music and some of the worst. Listening to Deliverance tells me that there is another change coming, and I don't like to think about that. I hear masterful songs done in the now traditional Opeth orchestral vein, like Fair Judgement. I hear riffs that get instantly old, even [weak], like the intro of Master's Apprentice and the last measures of the title track. I hear less time spent on craftmanship. This is the album every band eventually records. The tired, patchy album. And it's almost always downhill after that, sad to say.<br />Please Opeth, I know you're human and will change, I only wish you wouldn't.<br />I've listened to Deliverance many more times and I would like to retract the \\"tired, patchy album\\" comment and other expressions of disappointment. The band has not only delivered another fine work, but also aims its might directly at the forehead of those lucky souls who are addicted to Opeth. Absorbing Deliverance and really understanding its heft only on the tenth spin, I cannot give this four stars any longer. It's easily a five. Like previous Opeth observations, the music on this CD calls into question every other band and every album in my collection. <br />I remember discovering Metallica with the same trembling awe back in the 80s when they were still underground. They went on to become a massive mainstream success. Disappointingly, the band threw away the magic that created the success in the first place and began to play music of quite a different character and quality. <br />Naturally, no Opeth fan would want to relive the loss Metallica addicts went through and my original review reflected that fear. My new verdict is that Deliverance is NOT the album every band eventually does, after all. It is simply brilliant. Thank you, Opeth.
B00006690G|5.0|When Eminem's first Album came out I new I had to hear it immediately.  Then his latest album went up the charts and there is no doubt about \\"The Eminem Show\\".  His unique tunes and lyrics are the bomb and will never explode in years to come.  So if your reading my review then I'd say go out and buy this album... cuz damn!!

0066214122|4.0|This book is good.  Similar  to, but not as good as Jurassic park.  It was like Jurassic Park in that it warns of a  technology that is within reach of our generation.  The only problem is that nanotechnology although just as plausable, is not nearly as exciting as dinosaurs. <BR> <BR>   I actually liked the first half of the book more than the second.  In the first half of the book, Crichton was showing his prowess for writing poignant commentary on the reality of modern day marriages in which traditional gender-roles are reversed.  He definately wants to make the point that men can and sometimes do stay at home and take care of the family.  The mystery of whether or not Jack's wife was cheating on him was VERY well done.  <br />   In the second half of the book I found myself saying &quot;hasn't this been done before?&quot;  It seemed like I was experiencing another movie that I had seen SO many times before.  Same situation as with the dinosaurs, different technology. <br />    That leads me into another point that I want to make.  The book reads like a movie.  Michael Crichton is SO good at making the reader feel like he or she is right there with the characters.  Reading this book, I felt like I was watching a movie.  I could not put it down, and I read it in 3 days.  I think this is the reason I wanted to read this book, and the reason I will continue to read Crichton's books.  He has a gift for this that is better than any other auther that I have read.<br />   Although the book did not leave me feeling particularly good about the future possibility of nanotechnology taking on a life of it's own and taking over our lives, it did provide me with exceptional reading entertainment and as with many Crichton novels, make me feel more informed on a subject and possible technological danger that I had previously known nothing about.  I particularly liked his statement for the tombestone of the human race &quot;they did not know what they were doing.&quot;
B000058BGZ|5.0|The first recording I heard of the Schoenberg concerto was the live Glenn Gould performance with the CBC Symphony (a great recording, despite drastic ensemble problems).  Ever since then, all performances were a let down, until this one was released.  Uchida gives a very intelligent performance of the piece, showing more clearly than in any other performance I've heard, the great emotional depth and romantic quality of the music.  The difference is clear right from the beginning, when she unifies the opening piano solo into one coherent, beautiful thought.  And the quality of sound is far superior to that of the Gould recording.
B000069HJL|5.0|I First heard and owned this collection when it first came out in 1980 on Cassette.  I listened to it until it wore out.  Now here we are 22 years later and this newly remastered CD version is here... The sound is crystal clear, as if it were just recorded recently... the performances, magical... I never did get to see Supertramp back then, but I could not even begin to imagine what it would have been like to be sitting in that adience and hearing that phenomenal version of &quot;Fool's Overture&quot;... Just listening to it on the CD gives me goosebumps.. The rest of the songs here are just as good, from the opening harmonica on &quot;School&quot; to the closing Harmonica on &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;.  Highlights along the way are &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Ain't Nobody But Me&quot;, &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, &quot;Hide In Your Shell&quot;, &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Rudy&quot;, &quot;Soapbox Opera&quot;, &quot;Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;Fool's Overture&quot; and &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;.  <br />It really is amazing how much each member of this band contributed to this effort...  The drums and bass are rock solid, it seems like most of the band contribute backing vocals, and they are excellent at reproducing the keyboard-heavy arrangements.  I'm thinking in several places, three of them are playing keyboards (including the end of &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; where there also is sax... so maybe Dougie is playing some keyboard too?).  Anyway.. if all you've heard of Supertramp are their late 70s hits from Breakfast in America, you'll be extremely impressed at how much these guys could accomplish... if you're more of a fan, there's no reason why you don't have this already... sit back, turn down the lights and enjoy... Bon Soir Paris....
0618077367|5.0|My own teen-aged children enjoyed this as toddlers, and now I have passed it onto my younger nieces, nephews and friends.  I recommend the version with the audio tape, as even the most wonderful book can be tiresome to read night after night, but children never tire of hearing Liam Neeson reading this wonderful story.  If you have a special little one that likes trains, it's an even better gift than you could imagine!  Enjoy! (and wait for the bell to ring!)
B000059HAI|5.0|Most of the other reviews have covered much of the good points and bad points, so let me keep this short:<br />Tora! Tora! Tora! was made by both an American and Japanese production team whose job was to put on film BOTH sides of the attack.  The DVD comes with a 20 minute documentary on the attack and the movie also comes with a commentary by the American Director Richard Fleischer and a Historian on Japanese Film Stewart Galbraith.  For a lover of history, both American and Japanese, this film will touch your heart with not just the cold facts, but is also with scenes of horror and humor, TRUE scenes, carefully placed into the movie by people who want to tell the true tale.  If you want opera and computer designed explosions, watch 'Pearl Harbor'.  If you want the TRUTH of the 'Day of Infamy' get this film.
B00004Z459|5.0|U can't by this cd and not listen 2 it every day!! I cant beleive some of those fruitcakes didn't give it 5 out of 5. The best song is One Step Closer by far (Who doesnt like a screaming song?). If u are gonna buy 2 cds they should be this and Good Charlotte - The Young and the Hopeless.
B000077VPU|2.0|I was so excited to see this out on DVD, I went right out and bought it without checking it out.  I've worn out 2 VHS tapes of the concert.  Why am I [mad]?  Because they cut out a good 45 minutes of music.  Three incredible Metallica songs, a very good Guns n Roses set, a fun Xtreme medley, and an amazing Def Leppard/Brian May version of Here I am.  Don't get me wrong, the other songs are also great, but why cut anything?<br />I can't believe anyone who has the tape or the VideoDisc could ever give this a good review.  This a big business trying to make a quick buck by ripping off people who don't know any better and impulse-buying dummies like me.<br />At least they could have put the remaining songs on the second DVD.  Don't buy this DVD.  There's plenty of new VHS tapes available on Ebay for about 20 bucks.<br />I'd give it one star...but for Freddie, I'll give it 2.
B000002PCS|5.0|The music fits perfectly with \\"Somewhere in Time's\\" story. The music enables viewers to feel the depth of emotions that the characters are feeling. The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. The music of \\"Somewhere in Time\\" truly stays with you through time.  There hasn't been one romantic movie that I've seen to surpass the quality and beauty of both the movie and the soundtrack. If you like baroque music and loved soundtracks  from movies such as \\"The Red Violin,\\" \\"The Legend of 1900,\\" and \\"Out of Africa\\" chances are you will love this soundtrack.
B00005QGAV|5.0|My review is simply this: Michael Jackson is incredible, I love him and if I hear someone make fun of him, being a huge fan, I get furious. I HATE anyone who doesn't like him. How can't you. The media people are against him because he can sing a song on stage and make more money than they do in a year so I don't think there worth listenting to. This and all of his past, present and future CDs are masterpiecses.  Anyone who disagrees better pray to god they don't run into me.  By the way I am female.  As if you hadn't guessed.
B000066NW0|5.0|First of all for those people who did not even HEAR the cd, dont write a review because you wouldn't know. Avril has talent and she doesn't call herself &quot;punk&quot; or her music &quot;punk rock&quot;. Most people are just sterotypes. She just speaks her mind. I enjoy most of her songs. Do not miss out on:<BR>1. Losing Grip<BR>2. Complicated<BR>3. Sk8er Boi<BR>4. I'm With You<BR>5. Mobile<BR>6. Unwanted<BR>7. Tomorrow<BR>8. Anything but Ordinary<BR>9. Things I'll Never Say<BR>10. My World<BR>11. Nobody's Fool<br />Those are in my opinion the best out of 13.
0385508417|1.0|Subject says it all.... I found myself rolling my eyes through the entire book and saying, &quot;Give me a break.&quot;  Almost stopped reading it because of how ridiculous and yet predictable it was.  I was hoping the end might redeem it, but it didn't even come close.<br />INSTEAD OF &quot;SKIPPING CHRISTMAS&quot;, try SKIPPING THIS BOOK.
B00006G8LB|3.0|First, I must admit, I have never been a fan of, or read <BR>Spider-Man comics, so I can't compare the comics with the film. In my opinion, this movie was so hyped up in such a way that it could not possibly live up to expectations, including my expecations. The storyline reminds a B movie.<br />The storyline concerns high schooler Peter Parker, who is definitely not on the \\"A-list\\" at his school. He is unpopular, and feels out of place as he tries to impress the girl of his dreams. Then, one fateful day, his life is changed forever when, during a field trip through a spider-breeding lab, a genetically altered spider bites him. He then finds that his physical body has been enhanced, and eventually, he becomes half spider. He harnesses the ability to climb walls and skyscrapers, and leap far distances. He also finds he is able to shoot extremely strong web strings. Then, an archenemy arises, the Green Goblin, who is determined to kill Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man. Meanwhile, the media going wild with news stories of strange appearances Spider-Man and the Goblin. Throughout the movie Spider-Man uses his powers to rescue his girlfriend from various dangers. The climax features a big showdown between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, a hand-to-hand combat sequence. The film ends with a somewhat bittersweet ending. The ending makes it obvious that the doors are wide open for a Spider-Man 2.<br />Although Spider-Man wasn't a movie that met expectations exactly, it's still worth seeing. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing it again. If you enjoyed B-type movies like Lost in Space, Independance Day, Godzilla etc, you will enjoy Spider-Man.
0780020685|5.0|First let me say that I am not comparing this to the Magnificent Seven. I have not seen that classic Western. But I have seen this film, Kurosawa's greatest. Most people get initially put off by the 3.5 hour running time. Trust me, you won't even notice. I was glued to the screen for the whole time. It was amazing. After hearing so much about this film and seeing it all come to life. There are so many lessons in this film for everyone, from any background or profession. There are so many emotions and feelings that flow through this film. You can feel the bonds form between the 7 masterless samurai as they defend a lowly village from attack. You see the oldest and most experienced samurai who gives himself a mark of dishonor(he shaves his head bald to look like a monk) in order to save a young child. He becomes the mentor of the youngest samurai in the group. Teamwork abounds among strangers. Love springs forth in the time of war. Courage is tested, lives are lost, and honor is salvaged. The very last scene was just inspiring and will pull on your heartstrings. Don't settle for anything less then the full 3.5 hour version. It is time well spent.
6304539282|2.0|Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome.  Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions.  The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development.  The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . . . . . . . well, that's pretty much it.  Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants).<br />The characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal Chewbacca show a sense of humour.  The sexual tension between Princess Leia and handsome scoundrel Han Solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe).  In a clever twist, Yoda the Jedi Master is not a Hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-Sesame Street.<br />In the Special Edition of Episode IV, A New Hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and added to 20 years later.  Fortunately the same is not the case in Episode V.  But why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically?<br />For fanatics The Empire Strikes Back is of course an integral component of the Star Wars dynasty.  Viewers with a more casual interest in the story could probably get away with skipping this installment altogether.
B000075BFK|5.0|owning all 6 of pac's live albums (2pacalypse now and me against the world are my favorites) and all 6 of his post-mortem albums(r u still down), i can honestly say that this is one of the best post-mortem. hearing until the end of time, i was very disappointed. suge waited until he got out of jail so he could control the releases content. it showed in the un-pac like chorus' that did not relate to the content of the tracks. regardless, this is not a review of until the end.  needless to say, this album casts an enormous shadow on until the end. save r u still down, this is his best post-mortem release. other reviewers criticized it for being contradictory. who are we talking about here? Tupac is the most contradictory artist of our time.  changed man, never b peace, thugz mansion, better dayz, and who do u believe in were the highlights for me. if you don't want to drop [the money] borrow it from a friend. believe me, it's worth it. another thing, even though it's with nas, the acoustic version of thugz mansion is amazing. hearing pac's words to that background is a whole different realm of powerfull (listen to \\"sometimes i cry\\" on \\"rose...\\"). anyway if you can afford it, pick this one up; it is well worth it...and remember a human is not a thing to be tolerated, but a being to be celebrated. peace,<BR>me<BR>p.s.even though i believe he is dead, here is a quick run down of the case for pac's life: it is legal to fake your own death in las vegas (he died there), there is no crematory report, and a hidden track on disc 2 says, \\"expect me like you expect jesus to come back. expect me nigga, IM COMIN\\". pretty coincidental in my view. anyway came to your own conclusion. but don't forget that for those who believe no explanation is necessary, for those who don't, none will suffice.
B000007T2Z|5.0|\\"The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel, and the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides, and a dark wind blows. The government is corrupt, and we're on so many drugs, with the radio on and the curtains drawn. We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death. The sun has fallen down, and the billboards are all leering, and the flags are all dead at the top of their polls.\\"<br />With this harrowing, deep-voiced monologue begins _f#a#00_ (I can't make the infinity symbol so I'm improvising), a cinematic masterpiece lacking pictures but telling a lucid tale. Long, dusty, lonely elegies of smotheringly morose music illustrate a world on the brink of apocalypse. This is Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s first readily available album (forget trying to find their debut...only 33 copies were ever made ::sigh::), and to many it was their first experience to this band's stunning power. Calm but eerie silences can be extremely disarming as crescendos and loud dynamics can creep up unexpectedly, then retreat with equal abruptness. The band has seemingly concretized into a nonet, but here I'm not sure how many musicians actually worked on this record (I've heard numbers from nine to seventeen). Needless to say this is not a conventional rock band at all. I'm not sure I'd call this rock music anyway -- the writing is so structurally unusual, stylistically diverse, and instrumentally the band works more like a mini-orchestra. Each instrument, from violins to guitars to percussion, is an integral part of an organic collective rather than different musicians working together. Erm, those might sound like the same thing but they really aren't.<br />Each track is a lengthy suite (16-minutes, 18-minutes, and 28-minutes long) languidly flowing through several movements. Taken individually, each section is remarkable in its own right but the full power of the music is the meshing of different passages to splash different undertows of emotion over a general mood. One could easily say the individual passages have nothing to do with each other and feel randomly spliced together, but I couldn't disagree more. Each movement carries on from the last with coterminous emotions, establishing a congruous whole encapsulated within each track. Perhaps the different movements don't make cohering musical sense (though I don't know who would be actually qualified to say such a thing), but they _do_ make emotional sense.<br />\\"The preacher-man says it's the end of time...so says the preacher-man, but I don't go on what he says.\\"<br />For all of GYBE!'s anguished dirges for apocalyptic endings, there is a faint sparkle of hope sluiced somewhere inside that doomed, lonely shell. This dichotomy of tone -- faint-but-defiant hope and crushing despair -- is emotionally twisting, uniquely powerful, and has resonated through me ever since I've started listening to this band. I'm not sure how long the feeling will last, but this stuff cuts deep. The crescendos this band peaks at are nothing less than utterly overpowering -- 11 minutes into track 2, \\"East Hastings\\", I come dangerously close to crawling into a dark corner, clutching myself in the fetal position, and whimpering , \\"mommy...\\"<br />\\"...hungover it's awful, the sound of trains collapsing back behind of here; outside there are distant birds circling in front of 7 miles of heavy cloud falling down, &from where you're lying one of those clouds looks like a hanged man leading a blind, indifferent horse...THIS IS MILE END MY FRIEND, the hollowed out ruins here &a train runs straight thru them... we made a record here in mile End...\\"<br />Those familiar with the band's mythic anonymity and vehement artistic credo may call them pretentious, but I'll be damned if they don't write some of the greatest music I've ever heard. Turn off the lights, crank the volume (this needs to be heard LOUD), and become lost in Mile End. It's a despairing, forlorn place, butyou may never want to leave.ut you may never want to leave.
B00003CX95|4.0|This is a very good story,a nd a good movie. Don't imagine you know about today unless you know about the past. Mel Gibson provided the motivationa nd resources to tell the lost story of Scotland, and provide those of us who are Anglo-Saxon another glimpse of our own rich heritage, soemtimes being lost today. Good acting, great camera &amp; effects work, and the feel of the reality it portrays.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I listen to this CD everyday like its some kind of perscription for dealing with life as a twenty-something out in the real world.  His music is amazing.  AWESOME lyrics, awesome voice.  This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I listen to each and EVERY SONG on this album, never hit skip.  My favorite song is 1983.  Anyway GET THIS ALBUM.
0738206679|2.0|If you read this, you will read about Barabasi's exciting work and the work of his friends.  You will read about the risks he and his colleagues take with their careers.  You will read about the incredible inertia in academia.  But, you won't find much insight into the principles of network dynamics?<br />I'm not sure the book delivers.  We get a 'report from the field', but not much detail or general understanding.  It's all too confusing and new, if I caught Barabasi's drift.<br />But, is this a good 'introduction' to network dynamics?  Based on the reviews here, it seems clear the prose appeals to many readers.  If this inspires people to read more, then great.  I am afraid they are attracted by the comforting tone and soothing outlook, though.  We get too much of Barabasi, the expert grant writer.  Barabasi foresees network dynamics leading us to Kurzweil's happy 'Age of Spiritual Machines'.  A more down to earth view suggests networks bring us Osama Bin Laden.  Barabasi is quite thrilled to find small world dynamics in his network research, but never connects them to the 'small world dynamics' of drug lords and suicide bombers.<br />I'm a bit puzzled by Barabasi's problems with the details.  For example, he does a poor job of explaining exactly what a 'power-law' distribution might be, though he uses the term over and over, again. How does one 'find' a power-law in experimental data?  Most people have probably gone through much of their lives never seeing a single one! If you find one, will anyone agree with you?<br />Offering a few examples that one could work with at home would go a long way.  For instance, Barabasi talks about the way wealth approximates a power-law distribution.  If you try to work with published data on this subjects, there won't be much that looks like a power-law.  In fact, the whole idea is rather controversial.  It confounds our intuitions and sense of what is right.  A power-law distribution of wealth has a few rich, a few more at the 'middle income' level and huge masses in the 'poor' bracket. We would rather have income distributed according to a 'bell curve', a few rich, a few poor and most 'middle class.' If you want to claim 1) natural is 'good', 2) power-laws are 'natural',  and 3)  wealth has a power-law distribution, why complain about a vanishing middle class?  A big middle class is unnatural!<br />These and other conundrums of the network await the reader's next journey into the subject matter.'middle income' level and huge masses in the 'poor' bracket.

0066214122|1.0|The only other book of Michael Crichton's I have read is &quot;Timeline&quot;. Okay but rather trite and predictable. This new one looked intriguing so I bought it before I caught a flight. It starts out very well and the tension builds quite well. Unfortunately, once in Nevada and the &quot;swarms&quot; start, it goes downhill. The suspense just isn't there. Page after page of &quot;explanation&quot; and shallow characters and the &quot;F&quot; word every third sentence, made me leave this book on the plane for someone else to use as a sleep-aid.
0066214122|1.0|Is this book just evidence to support his divorce?<BR>Does his x-wife get the rights , so he just wants to punish her?<BR>As usual , he is on the cutting edge of technology, but all he seems to want to do is write a mysogonists diatribe against women and mothers. I guess this book should be used in writing class to teach why someone going through a divorce should not write.

0330332775|5.0|Come on now- if you are out shopping for your next read and browse the first paragraph in this book you will understand that no, this book was not likely to be nominated for the Booker Prize, however if you are looking for some fantastic &quot;mind candy&quot; (not to be taken seriously, which doesn't take itself too seriously either,-just something to enjoy and to make you literally laugh out loud or at the least, smile or smirk) this is a great choice.<BR>The only flaw that this book now has (which is not actually a fault of the book itself) is that it was made into a mediocre movie that many people will likely have seen, therefore taking away from the Bridget you can enjoy in reading Helen Fieldings two books.<BR>Nonetheless, these two books are fantastic choices for Christmas presents for those friends, or sisters who enjoy a fun read.
0375703764|5.0|Well, as someone already mentioned, the book has a WARNING not to read it. Also, in the part where authors say this book is for so and so, this books says \\"This book is not for you.\\" This book can be confusing because the plot is about Johnny but in the midst of his footnotes there is Nadivson and some other information, written like an essay. Im not going to even TRY to explain it, its just weird. But lets just say that I'm kinda freaked out that my closet will suddenly be a huge, vast, infinite hallway. <br />The book was not scary like watching a horror film but it's very creppy. It has psychological fear because there isn't ANYTHING like it so you imagine everything and you have your opinion about it. The fear is in your imagination.
B000002J1F|5.0|Fragile, Yes' first album with Rick Wakeman on keys turned out being argubly their finest. This is easily one of those albums that should be brought up instantly when one debates over the greatest rock albums ever, along with Sgt. Peppers, Dark Side of the Moon, Zoso, Abbey Road, Sticky Fingers, etc.  <br />In this album each member gets to showcase their talents in a song. For example, Jon Anderson displays his vocal range in &quot;We Have Heaven&quot; which opens up for the awesome &quot;South Side Of The Sky&quot;. Steve Howe showcases his classical guitar play on &quot;Mood For A Day&quot;. Chris Squire shines on the &quot;The Fish&quot;, which follows one of my favorites in &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;. Rick Wakeman's keyboard style will leave one with their mouths open, especially in &quot;Cans &amp; Brahms&quot;. <br />The obvious and most known tracks on this album are &quot;Roundabout&quot; &amp; &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;, but also contains 2 more tracks which are easily as good or arguably even better in &quot;South South Of The Sky&quot; and the masterful &amp; beautiful &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot;. <br />I really can't find anything wrong with this album, well probaly except for Bill Bruford's &quot;Five Per Cent For Nothing&quot;, which i usually skip thru.<br />This album is a must for anybody!
B00005JL78|5.0|This is a bizare tale that in some ways the same strange universe as A.I. Artificial intelligence.  However instead of going into the strange world that was represented by Stanly Kubrick Steven Speilberg went about his own path in this case and created in some ways the surreal world of A.I., but with action of Indiana Jones, and the frightening atmospere that E.T. featured towards of the end.<br />This movie is about John Anderson, a cop whos job is to catch criminals before they commit the crime.  The criminals are spotted by a trio of psychics.  The story is about John Anderson who is the target of these crimes.  However in the case here he believes that he is being set up.  As he runs he must under go many procedures all for the sake of clearing his name.<br />This story is action packed yet tragic at the same time.  I would highly recomend this to anyone out there who enjoys an action film, a sci fi film, or incredibly entertaining film.<br />In the end this is well worth checking into.  Rent it or buy it this a must have film that proves that Steven Speilbrg still has the touch.
0385508417|5.0|This could quite possiby be the most funny story that I have ever read. This story left me wanting and searching for another just like it for this Christmas. In all of he stress of the holiday Grisham brings uncontrolable laughter in his story of a couple that decide to forgo the holiday rituals when their daughter goes overseas. Never dreaming that their neighbors would see this as an act of treasonous behavior. As if Luthers wife's apprehensions were not enough to contend with, Luther than has to eventually deal with sneaking around his own home to avoid the neighbors incessant attempts to get him to celebrate the holiday in the usual ritual fashion.<br />After reading the other reviews I have come to the conclusion that those who cannot see the wonderful humor in this light-hearted Christmas story are the ones who have lost the ability to enjoy all that Christmas can be. Yes, including all the crowds, the cost and the hassles. Grisham puts all these into perspective with the ending thought that what really makes Christmas so special isn't anything less than making the holiday special for those we care about most.<br />* Caution: those who choose to read this may find themselves laughing loud and hardy. Grisham's side-splitting humor will leave you ready to take on the world (or mall) with a whole new outlook.
B000065U1N|5.0|This has to be on of the finest war movies ever made.  From beginning to end.  The cast is excellent also.  Though i found it easier to understand it once i read the book, it is still a great film.  From Jamie Smiths death, to teh defense of the second crash you can hardly hold back tears. The best film of the year.
B00005YW4H|5.0|i'm a huge fan of slipknot and stone sour but i was looking for a mellow cd, a mix of the beatles and soft music. i saw norah on t.v. and i had found the artist i was looking for. she has a way with her music that makes rainy days seem perfect. i highly rate this cd a 5. if they had more stars i'd max it out. norah jones has a soft soothing voice and that calms you and makes you feel totally relaxed. the song 'come away with me', i feel, is a very good loveish song. the type of a song that you would play for your boyfirend or girlfriend just because you love them. the soft paino tunes on the cd are very calming on a stressfull day. a very good cd to put little kids to bed with, no loud noises on it, no screaming or yelling, just noarh jones soft motherish voice softly singing you into a state of total relaxtion. all in all an amazing cd!
B000066NW0|2.0|I must admitt that &quot;Complicated&quot; was a song that I sang almost EVERYWHERE.  After a while the song becomes too boring and you get to realise that the lyrics are meaningless and stupid. That's what happens with the rest of the songs too.  <BR>Avril's tough punk image is NOT at all seen in her songs.  Her songs are nothing but mournfull ballads.  Avril's voice is also HORRIBLE!  I can't believe she ACTUALLY got a record deal.  Her voice sounds rough and she sounds as though she is constipated.  Her songs like &quot;I'm with You, Naked, Mobile&quot; are ear throbbing songs.<BR>The CD does have SOME good songs too, like &quot; Things I'll never Say, Sk8ter Boi, Tomorrow, and My World.&quot;<BR>Don't be fooled by Avril's punk image cause her songs aren't what they seem to be.  At first I thought it was another &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; a CD I adore, but I was very dissapointed.<BR>If you like Sk8ter Boi and Complicated don't bother buying &quot;Let Go&quot; simply go and buy the singles, because Avril Lavigne is just another one hit wonder, by next year there will be a million Avril Lavigne look alikes, she'll be nothing but a memory.<BR>Avril Lavigne should &quot;Let Go&quot; of her dreams of becoming a 'famous' singer, cause with these songs she will go nowhere.<BR>And that is the truth....
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer is without a doubt is anyone's is one the greatest advances in mind the birth of metal(next to Black Sabbath,Metallica,Venom,and Death).Reign In BLood is the of of the heavyest albums ever.And for all of you that say they aren't talented try playing a double bass drum while flaming beat with the tempo at 200!it's not easy!I've been plaing for 3 years and I can't come close to Slayer! or guitar at 200!These are the kings of metal.And the lyrics are some of the greastest ever.If Slayer and the rest did'nt come along every metal rocker would be like Linkin Park and Avril Lavine(Possers!).IN short ladies and gentlemen this is a must have for anyone that wants heavy.Other bands you may like Venom,Death,Napalm Death, and Metallica,.Thank you.

B00005YW4H|3.0|Honestly, this is a decent cd but it's not one of those ones where I can just put it on and listen to it from beginning to end without skipping around. In fact none of the songs really stand out, except for &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; because of its radio play. Don't get me wrong, she has potential and is off to a fine start, and she is a welcome break from the pop singers out there, but the comparison to other blues giants is giving her too much credit. Just having a sultry voice alone does not make someone the next Etta or Billie.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Okay, as we all know Pink has been known for bringing lady anthems to the music table but she decided to go a whole different way with this soft and sentimental record. As it turns out, pink has a heart! Listening to this album I was stunned by the lyrics about her child hardships, lost loves and heartbreaks. Wow! she blew me away. I was already a fan but I never knew that Pink would ever do somthing like sing about her dad leaving as a child or feeling like her home was WW3. Her voice never fails to blow others out of the water and you can feel her and begin to know Pink on a whole new level with this Album. Yeah, there are some tight club songs like &quot;Get This Party Started&quot; And 18 Wheeler, but songs like &quot;Dear Diary&quot; &quot;Family Portrait&quot; &amp; Eventually&quot; gave the album that new soft side that she was going for. This is my favortie CD. Thanks Pink!

0060168366|1.0|.<br />I have recently discovered that this book is vastly overrated. In fact, I would now label it \\"trash.\\"<br />It sat mostly unopened on my shelf since its publication, until a footnote in another book I was reading caused me to follow its reference to the Johnson book. Writing about Thomas Jefferson, Johnson says:<br />...  From claret to concubinage, there was no delight<br />...  he did not sample, or rather indulge in<br />...  habitually. (p. 242)<br />...  So Jefferson's wife was in intimate daily contact ...<br />...  with her husband's concubine. (p. 242)<br />...  Jefferson's expensive tastes might not have proved<br />...  so fatal to his principles had he not also been an<br />...  amateur architect of astonishing persistence and<br />...  eccentricity. (p. 244)<br />...  It is just as well that Jefferson had no sense of<br />...  humor: he constitutes in his own way an egregious<br />...  comic character, accident-prone and vertiginous, to<br />...  whom minor catastrophes accrued. (p. 246)<br />...  As originally built his bedroom [at Monticello]<br />...  accorded him no privacy at all, a curious oversight<br />...  considering he had a passion for being alone and<br />...  unobserved. Thereafter the search for privacy became<br />...  an obsession in the many changes of design ...<br />...  Contemporaries assumed they were there so his alleged<br />...  mistress, Sally Hemmings, could slip in and out of his<br />...  chamber unobserved. (p. 247)<br />Now whatever one thinks of the supposed affair between Jefferson and Hemmings, and I believe it to be complete and utter BS, it is hard to get around the fact that Jefferson's wife died when Sally Hemmings was not yet nine years old. Suggesting that Martha Jefferson was in \\"intimate daily contact with he husband's concubine,\\" is alone sufficient to disqualify Johnson as a serious historian. I tried to follow some of Johnson's footnotes, but found them either irrelevant or dead ends for me. (My personallibrary does have its limitations.) As for the \\"contemporaries\\" description of Jefferson's quarters, I would offer:<br />...  His apartments had no private entrance not perfectly<br />...  accessible and visible to all the household. No female<br />...  domestic ever entered his chambers except at hours when<br />...  he was known not to be there, and none could have<br />...  entered without being exposed to the public gaze.<br />This is from a letter written in 1858 by a Jefferson granddaughter. ...<br />Regarding the snide comments like \\"amateur architect,\\" well I guess Johnson never visited the University of Virginia. Why would he have wanted to? There are scholars there.
B00006G8K0|5.0|I won't write a big review because most everyone has writen what I have to say about this film. It's just great and works on ever level that most all of Hammer's films would. For me Christopher Lee IS Dracula. He looks scary and evil, someone you wouldn't want to meet in the middle of the night on a dark street. I mean Bela Lugosi is great also as the Count, but his Dracula is more gentlemanly and dapper, not the animal that Christopher Lee's Dracula is. Now it's not the best Dracula film ever made ... but this is the best of all Hammer's Dracula films. I just wish that the DVD would have had some extras like it was planed to have had on it.
B00003CX5P|1.0|With the original \\"Star Wars\\" and its sequels, George Lucas didn't invent the dominant mode of filmmaking today, but he (along with Steven Spielberg) can probably be credited with perfecting it. That mode might be termed \\"whiz-bang,\\" where character and even plot are subjugated to spectacle and effects. What plot the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy had was essentially cobbled together in paint-by-numbers fashion from the work of Joseph Campbell, presumably in the expectation that recurring motifs in mythology represent universal metaphors of human existence and so can be used as templates for popular stories. If the grosses of these films were any indication, this expectation might have been right. Certainly the original trilogy had its moments, though it bears up less and less well as time goes on--the first movie, for example, while an occasionally exhilarating tribute to old sci-fi movie serials, seems to me now to be too filled with mindless, juvenile bickering; the second, grandiose in ambition but disappointing; the third, a puerile marketing ploy disguised as a film.<br />Unfortunately, \\"Episode I,\\" or \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" or whatever one wishes to call this movie, patterns itself more explicitly along the lines of \\"Episode VI\\" (or \\"The Return of the Jedi\\"). The most pathetic example of this is the land race between Anakin Skywalker and a host of strange alien creatures on Tatooine, which runs on screen (or on TV) exactly as one might expect it to run on a video game console, which of course is entirely the point. The only reason for the character of Jar-Jar Binks to exist is to provide an excuse for another action figure; after a certain point, the cross-marketing examples are too numerous to bother with any longer.<br />More disturbing is the pervasive racist stereotyping in the film. Much has been made of the similarities between Binks and the old negro caricature Stepin Fetchit, but this was less obvious to me than the similarities between the evil tradersand old-movie caricatures of evil Chinamen. The choppy Asian accents given to such characters were a little shocking to me, although it is possible to see how these characters were meant as an homage to (read: ripoff of) B-movies of the 1930s and 40s.<br />Overall, one gets the distinct impression that after taking the greatest of care with the digital animation and special effects, there just wasn't much time or effort left over for less important matters such as character or plot. Darth Maul is meant to be a sinister, evil figure; I know this is so, because he looks like a red demon, has the requistite horns on his head, and sneers at several choice moments. On the other hand, we are never given a real reason why we should believe he is so evil. My alternative interpretation of the film is that Darth Maul is a tragic hero.  Here, after all, is a hardworking individual so dedicated to his cause and loyal to his superiors that he will take on two Jedi knights singlehandedly just to help his allies in battle. Unlike \\"Episode IV,\\" where we at least got to see Darth Vader pull a few dastardly deeds, there is no real reason to believe Darth Maul is anything more than a dedicated servant to a misunderstood cause.  That this represents a plausible conclusion is one of the surest indications of utterly inept storytelling.<br />\\"The Phantom Menace\\" is a George Lucas creation and an integral part of a \\"Star Wars\\" franchise that will defy any criticism in its uptake of money. It is also, however, a terrible film with all the depth of a carnival ride. Its popularity is probably an indication of the expectations of its audience, which these days rarely extend beyond such transitory thrills. If a thrill is all you need, by all means hop on the \\"Star Wars\\" ride. If you are more interested in a good story, a good film, or (heaven forbid) science fiction, look elsewhere.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I sat through this movie while it was in the theater very frustrated at the amount of dialogue and walked away thinking it was the worst movie I had ever seen.  And yet, and yet: it is a remarkable accomplishment if only for the complexity of its dialogue and the abundance of its major characters.  Never before have I seen a movie that is so able to carry multiple story lines as deftly as Gosford Park.  Gosford Park is not a movie that one can sit through once and 'get'.  But those who put in the time to view it multiple times will be rewarded.
B000002MIF|5.0|It's a testimony to the outstanding songwriting talents of Morrissey and Marr that this hastily compiled collection of radio sessions , b-sides , and the odd single , is now rightly regarded as one of the seminal albums of the Eighties .<br />Perhaps it's the unbelievable vitality of the band , it might even be the black humour , and profundity of Morrissey's lyrics , or Johnny Marr's incredibly inventive guitar playing on such tracks as - William It Was Really Nothing , - Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now , and the awesome - How Soon Is Now ?  It might be the sublime melodic qualities found on gems like the heartbreaking but beautiful - Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want , ( without doubt the greatest sub-2 minute song that these music-drenched ears have heard ) , or it could be that these subversive , unorthodox \\" rock \\" songs are just so stunningly vibrant , but it's probably a combination of all these things plus the less tangible that elevates this collection of songs from merely very good material to great material imbued with real genius !<br />Very few bands have been blessed with the elusive qualities to achieve greatness , but The Smiths had these qualities in abundance as this collection proves . A rare talent indeed .    <BR>   The Smiths Is Dead - Long Live The Smiths !
B00004WGAA|4.0|The Carnival of Souls DVD that I own is the Diamond Entertainment version paired with Christopher Lee's Horror Hotel.  Both films are fully restored and enhanced.  Carnival is the real treat here-- a minor classic guaranteed to get under your skin, especially if seen in the wee hours of the morning.  Hotel is uneven, but still above-average.  Carnival is the original theatrical version (I believe-- 80 minutes?); though I do own a VHS (which gives the time as 84 minutes) where some goofy special effects (called Super-Psychorama) are added briefly to enhance some scenes, but just detract from the atmosphere of the film--avoid this version.  The print of Horror Hotel was especially satisfying as I own the Screen Gems VHS version where the print is so scratched up it looks like the movie was filmed in a heavy downpour.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  Major beef: The background information on the films is reversed, i.e., the information in the Carnival of Souls section is actually for Horror Hotel, and vice versa.  Heads should roll for this kind of blatant stupidity.

B00000APLB|3.0|After purchasing Flashpoint and Get yer ya yas out, I made the trip to my local CD store and picked up Love You Live and compared to the other 2, I was kind of disappointed. Sure, this isn't a bad live album, its pretty decent but outside of great renditions of \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", \\"Star Star\\", and \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\", there isn't much to write home about here.
B000003BEM|4.0|After learning that they weren't quite ready to start producing their own albums (Satanic Majesties...what a disaster!), the Rolling Stones came back with Beggars Banquet, offering further proof of why any serious music fan will consider them \\"The Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band of All Time\\". While not quite measuring up to \\"Let it Bleed\\" (the only reason I can't give this album a full five stars!), Banquet is outstanding from beginning to end. This record is a wonderful combination of their blues roots and the more amplifier-driven rock of the era, a trend that Mick and Keith quickly latched onto and eventually became the leaders of (until the appearance of another fantastic group, Led Zeppelin). It's nice to see Banquet packaged with the original cover, after American distributers originally objected to the image of a toilet. Like nearly everything from the Rolling Stones, Beggars Banquet is, quite simply, timeless. Only the fact that the band is once again performing \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" while on tour could possibly take some of the magic away from this album.
B00006X06U|4.0|I'm very biased when it comes to Joni Mitchell. For instance, \\"Shadows and Light\\" is THE desert island CD of my 1,000+ collection. and I have almost everything that she has recorded in her career. This CD is the next level of Joni's non-stop innovation journey, and yet is very much along the lines of the beautiful \\"Both Sides Now\\" from the year 2000.<br />The version of \\"Amelia\\" is just extraordinary.<br />If you are not very much into Joni, then I would not start with this one. It may look like a little bit repetitive and you may even think that a double CD has been a little bit of an overkill (despite the great quality of the edition, art, booklets, drawings, etc). But if you have been loyal to this lady -at least lately- you'll love this CD, even though big fans like myself may be missing the sound of the (late Jaco Pastorius' ) fretless bass in this version of \\"Hejira\\" and the inclusion of some key songs (i.e. \\"Blue\\").
B00005JLD2|5.0|Between 1905 and 1971, the Australian government had a horrible policy.  They forcibly removed all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools.  The grown daughter of one of these children wrote a book about her mother's experiences.  This film is an adaptation of that book.<br />The story takes place in 1931, when Molly, then 14, her sister Daily, then 8, and her cousin Gracie, then 10, are literally torn from the arms of their mothers, put in a cage, and taken 1,200 miles away to a school which is actually a sort of prison.  Here, they are forbidden to speak their own language, they have to attend a Christian church, and are taught the ways of the white Australian culture around them.  Led by Molly, the girls run away.  And most of the film is the odyssey of their trek back home, following the rabbit-proof fence that bisects Australia, constructed to keep rabbits out of the pastureland.<br />The villain is clearly the white director of the school. It is amazing, but he actually believes in the racial theories that were prevalent at the time. He believes he is helping them and plays his role well, coming across as stupid and misguided rather than evil.  The Aboriginal girls are all unknowns, and terrific actresses, as are the women who play Molly and Daisy's mother and grandmother. The courage and determination of the girls during their three-month journey, the people they meet along the way, and their efforts to dodge the trackers who have been sent to retrieve them by the school, is truly inspiring.  This is all set against the backdrop of the Australian outback; the cinematography certainly captures its beauty.<br />The film is 94 minutes long and moves quickly.  I immediately identified with the girls and felt their fear as well as their bravery as they made their way across the Australian continent.  In a postscript to the story, we learn more about their lives.  It did not turn out to be pretty.  But two of the girls have survived into their nineties, and we meet them briefly.  They are strong women with weathered faces, one of them walking with a cane, but clearly at home in their Outback surroundings.<br />The film is a lesson in inspiration and courage as well as a geography and history lesson about Australia.

0066214122|4.0|As usual, Dr. Crichton gives us a brisk overview of a complex subject and then cautions us about the potential Frankenstein monster lurking in the wings. All of this is a bit formulaic by now, as are his characters, and yet in some ways nobody does it better. As usual, it's real food for thought (and in this case we may be the food for that thought,both literally and figuratively!) The thriller/horror film blockbuster potential is also there, although as a real horror fan I'd rather they made a book out of Harry Shannon's rollicking 'Night of the Beast,' so there would be some more surprises in store. You know where this one is going every step of the way, although you still want to read it.

6303073107|4.0|I've heard about this 1950 Japanese film all my life and have even incorporated the word \\"Rashomon\\" into my vocabulary.  It means that the truth is elusive and people will remember things with their own particular spin.  When the film first came out it was nominated for an academy award and is still considered the masterpiece of the director Akira Kurosawa.<br />Shot in black and white, the mood is set right at the beginning, as there's a rainstorm going on and a priest and a woodcutter are seeking shelter in an ancient temple.  Both of them are troubled, as they have heard witnesses to a crime explain events that they just \\"don't understand\\".  When a third man joins them, they tell their stories.  Eventually the audience watches the reenactment of four different versions of the same incident.  At the end, there is still confusion.<br />The acting is done in classical Japanese style, which is more appropriate for a large auditorium than for a small screen.  The actors shout, they roll their eyes, and every gesture is exaggerated.  There's passion throughout and a great mythic theme.  It seemed all to be set on a great stage.  And the interesting part is that three out of the four people telling the story claim to be the killer.  The cinematography is also special, using the rain as one realm of reality and harsh sunlight as another.  The woods in which the crime takes place look hot and stifling, and the actors are all excellent.<br />However, once the novelty of the setting and the dramatic elements of this stylized film wore off, I found myself restless.  It was only 83 minutes long but it seemed much longer.  I do applaud its art and its message.  I therefore recommend it.  However, I just can't help the fact that it didn't engage me completely.
B000077VPU|3.0|I was trolling for Christmas gifts when I happened on the 10th Anniversary DVD release of the 1992 concert. My original exposure to this concert was a copy of the VHS tape that I borrowed from a friend, who had borrowed it from another friend. I was stoked!<br />Too bad. One of the most powerful distillations of rock & roll was contained on that tape. The DVD, inexplicably, has left off a significant part of the show, i.e., the daylight part. Coincidentally, this also eliminated much of the American bands' input. A killer lead-off set of 3 songs by Metallica - gone. Paradise City and Knockin' on Heaven's Door by GNR - gone. The tape was nearly 3 hours of music, yet the publishers felt it necessary to give us 2 discs with far less music and much more peripheral stuff. <br />The video part is a definite improvement on the scratchy old tape. The audio part, well, I'm not convinced it's better. The DTS sound is muddy and poorly balanced. Switch your receiver to stereo or direct output for a sharper playback.<br />If I'd never viewed the tape I'd probably give this DVD 4 or maybe even 5 stars as the concert was still one of the best ever captured on film...

0066214122|5.0|Let me start by trying to explain to my long-suffering editor why I started reading PREY, Michael Crichton's new novel, when I had a groaning table full of books assigned to be reviewed before that one. As I write this, I can see her nodding bemusedly on the other side of the e-mail ether as she reads my explanation which, although true, sounds lame-o, even to me.<br />All I did was pick up PREY and started skimming Crichton's introduction to get a glimmer of what it was about. The title of the introduction --- Artificial Evolution in the Twenty-first Century --- hooked me. So I read the introduction, which begat the Prologue. And the Prologue begat Chapter One. And behold, before I knew it, I was at page 20 plus 100. The temple virgins had extinguished the vessels and night had fallen. And I kept reading.<br />Just try to stop. Crichton does with PREY what he does so well, which is to take what's happening right now and extrapolate it to take a peek at what might happen tomorrow. Or this afternoon. Or maybe five minutes ago.<br />PREY concerns something called nanotechnology --- and we're not talking about devices to help your Italian mother. Nanotechnology, or molecular manufacturing, is something else. I'm going to really oversimplify it here, because I'm no good at all at explaining anything more complex than a soup sandwich, but here goes: We can't physically manufacture microchips any smaller than we currently do now, so we're going to grow them and make them self-replicating. The practical applications are enormous, mind-boggling and, as Arthur C. Clarke said about the Universe, more than we are able to imagine.<br />The problem is whether or not we are going to be able to control these chips. As they come into contact with more and more elements in the biosphere, the greater the opportunity they will have to interact, adapt and evolve. And what happens if they become deliberately and consciously opportunistic? Well, Crichton provides one possible scenario tothis and one possible answer. And believe me, you won't be more than a third of the way into PREY before you consider that your wacky Luddite niece may be worth listening to.<br />PREY is told through the voice of Jack Forman, a systems guy who is a victim of Silicon Valley intrigue. As he unwillingly slips gradually into the role of a stay-at-home husband, his wife, a dynamic woman who is vice-president of a technology firm, becomes more involved in a secret project and exponentially more distant. He initially suspects that she might be having an affair; by the time he discovers the truth, he'll wish it was that simple. In fact, his wife has been working on a method of growing molecules. But the blessing of its creators and in the interest of science, this project has spun out of control. One reading of PREY and you'll never look at a summer swarm of insects at sunset the same way again.<br />PREY is a cautionary tale, in the same vein as THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and RISING SUN. One reading and you'll find that the big, bulky eight pound laptop you're lugging around is quite small enough. Anything smaller might not be worth the cost.<br />--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
B000002HH2|5.0|I personally loved Debut with it's dance beats and its trippy lyrics, but Post is what turned me into a bona fide Bjork fan. The album, in my opinion, is brilliant. Throughout, Bjork brings an exotic and wild flavor to her music, which makes you want to tame it and become part of it at the same time. From the industrial \\"Army Of Me,\\" theatrical frollicks of \\"It's Oh So Quiet,\\" the lullaby-like-music-heard-on-a-radio-signal-from-another-planet,\\"Possibly Maybe\\" to the primitive feeling \\"Isobel\\" the album is unique, original, ahead of its time, thoughtful, emotional and breathtaking. Some may find Bjork's voice something to be desired, but just give it a chance. In my opinion, she kind of reminds me of an Icelandic Billie Holiday. Bjork brings so much emotion and character to her voice you can't help but wonder if she's acting out her songs as if being the star in her own futuristic musical.
B000002LMM|5.0|The damp, gray overcast scenery surrounding Twin Peaks is wonderfully complimented by this hauntingly misty score.

B00004XONN|4.0|This was the Number One album in the country upon the first week of release. This might lead one to the question, \\"What are our kids ingesting?\\" Radiohead are clearly one of the most interesting, and successful bands of the modern era. Their song \\"Creep\\" from their first album is the classic ode to self-denigration and served as a clarion call to their talent. Their next album, \\"The Bends\\" is melodic, powerful and superb. Their last 2 albums have been increasingly experimental and decreasingly accessible. Legend has it that the Grateful Dead created their album \\"Aoxomoxoa\\" while devouring nitrous oxide. It appears that Radiohead may have the same dentist. Much of this album is, to these ears, more 'sound' than 'music'. And the lyrics, though provocative, are enigmatic, to say the least. Nevertheless, there are more than a few snatches of melody on this to convey a quiet beauty which few albums equal. Occasionally driving rhythms appear and stir the soul. The mix of 'organic' and 'electronic' instruments are frequently brilliant. And Thom Yorke is one of the most intense and beautiful singers in Rock today. Headphones and an open mind are recommended.
B000002ULO|5.0|The reason why I love this album is because I am a big fan of Paul McCartney and I have heard the story and I thought of John when I heard it.I was 14 when it came out and shortly after it was released I went to the music store and got it and I just love all of the pictures in the book inside!They really took alot of time with it and when Ringo  and Paul's son James got in the album it had great meaning to some of the songs.Go get this album and you will see what I mean.
B00007BHOE|5.0|this is in the top 5 of my music dvds (i only have 5), and im not even done watching it yet. this is definetly one of the (sic)est dvds ever. buy this if u have sense.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|What is most amazing here is the fact that even if these 27 former #1 songs never existed, The Beatles would still be      considered the greatest rock band of all. Twenty             seven No.1 songs and what sticks out is what is                 NOT on here--nothing from Sgt. Pepper                           (considered by many to be &quot;the best&quot; album of                    the rock era), nothing from the White Album                   (considered by others to be &quot;the best&quot;), nothing               from Rubber Soul (our personal favorite), and                  only 2 songs (Eleanor Rigby, and the novelty                  Yellow Submarine) from the classic Revolver. No                &quot;In My Life&quot;, no &quot;For No One&quot;, no &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;, or countless other favorites. This album is just 27 songs that will jolt your memory, alert your kids, bond you to                 your neighbor, put a grin on your face, a swivel             in your hips, and joy in your heart. And that's<BR>                             not bad.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Do yourself a favor and buy the original Time Machine (1960) starring Rod Taylor.  It's a far better adaption of the HG Wells novel.
B0000048V8|5.0|This is a very gentle, beautifully done video. Definitely a Christmas classic. All ages will enjoy it. There is no dialogue, just background music, which is also very well done.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is my favorite album of the Stones' &quot;Classic&quot; period; dark, brooding, but with a deceptive sense of playfullness (Live With Me, Monkey Man), Let It Bleed is an absolute delight, and if you do not own it...well, you're missing out.<br />Additionally, this is by far the best this album has ever sounded. While Beggars Banquet's restoration seemed to get more press, it's clear that the tape used to create this CD is much, much closer to source than any that's been used previously. A little experiment: turn off the left channel of your stereo, and listen to Love in Vain. Hear the guitar bleed through to the other channel? Well, this disc eliminates that...it's so clear that you can hear what sounds like construction going on in the background of that track! <br />Get it. Along with Beggars and 12x5, this is of the triad of undisputed successes in the reissue series.
B00000263T|5.0|Accept was always in the shadow of the legendary Scorpions. This was their most solid effort. It might have not have been their heaviest, but it was their best. The band sounds great. The singing is not for people looking for Paul Rodgers or Lou Gramm. It's more like a cross between Brian Johnson and Paul Di'anno. This record sounds like &quot;British Steel&quot; era Priest. If you are a classic heavy metal fan(traditional, not thrash or speed), you will enjoy this album. If you do, make sure to check out all of Accept's back catalog.
B00006AW2P|4.0|For whatever reason, ABKCO chose to reissue the American version of their first album yet again, despite the fact that it differs by exactly one cut (\\"Not Fade Away\\" instead of \\"Mona\\"). Ahh, who knows.<br />In any case, while those expecting sonic delights should stay away--produced Oldham, intimidated by the use of multi-track on Come On, decided to record this album directly to mono--this is a prime slice of distorted, raw R&B; it's a far rougher start than the Beatles' Please Please Me, but enjoyable all the same. It's mythical reputation is perhaps slightly undeserved, but it still rocks.<br />I've always been puzzled, by the way, as to why the two original tracks here don't get praised more highly. Well, maybe that's only half true; \\"Tell Me\\" seems to have its followers, but nobody ever seems to mention \\"Little By Little,\\" an soundalike track that tends to impress me more than most of the covers on the album.<br />Finally, a little point of miscellany. ABKCO finally decided to bestow upon US listeners the 4:05 version of \\"Tell Me,\\" which had only previously been available on disc on long out-of-print German and Japanese CDs. Unfortunately, instead of the cold ending featured on those discs, we are granted the full 4:05 version, but with a gradual fadeout. Unfortunate.<br />Verdict: It's a bit of a ripoff at retail in this day and age, with its short running length and rough sound quality, but give it a shot; you'll never believe this is the same band that did \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll!\\"
0385501560|4.0|There are very few books and very few authors that have hooked me the way i was hooked by Chuck Palahniuk's &quot;Choke.&quot;  It is a truly original, no-holds-barred novel.  When future generations look back on the edgy, forward thinking authors of today, Chuck Palahniuk will surely be atop the list.
B00005JKDR|5.0|&quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; is a hilarious computer-animated movie just like &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. John Goodman is hilarious as James P. Sullivan (Sulley) same with Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski, Sulley's best friend. If you have a DVD player, please buy this DVD. It will be part of your collection and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B00005JL96|5.0|Fantastic movie! Fun for all ages and really sweet without being too cliched.  The DVD has some good features on it- worth the extra money just to see the cute trailers.
6303140157|4.0|This is a great film, and people who know how to connect with real folks understand that. For people who aren't raising teens or who just don't connect with kids, this movie may at first glance be trite and uninteresting. Take another look, because kids really CAN do this--it isn't just a cool idea for a film. What tugs the heart is watching it happen (plus the music is terrific). A variation on &quot;To Sir With Love&quot; or &quot;Mr. Holland's Opus&quot; or &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; or &quot;October Sky&quot;? Sure, I guess. But WHY do producers and directors keep creating these great films, and WHY do we keep loving them? In a time when the government wants us to hold schools and teachers &quot;accountable&quot; for the demise of our youngsters and our society, these stories show us what MANY real teachers--and students--are doing, and it gives us hope. Watch this movie and let these kids be real to you. Just knowing where your kids are and what they are doing isn't enough. Somebody (you?) will have to be there for them. THEN something good can happen.
B000002UAO|1.0|flop! what goes on sounds terrible! nowhere man sounds lousy!<BR>In my life and run for your life are acceptable,...<BR>the rest are in the garbage! this transition Beatle´s album is one of the weakest album in the 60.
B00006CXSS|2.0|Although the sound and special effects are very good the screenplay is almost near to a fairytale. The American soldiers apear more like perfect killing machines and the German troops like Sissies. Where is the documentary in that? For example: (An American soldier throws a grenade over 100 meters in a small window even being sitting behind sacks under fire!...)Wow! I didn't think Jordan could do it! I rest my case.
B00006NSZ5|3.0|This was a decent soundtrack.  It wasn't as good as I expected, but it certainly wasn't bad.  My favorite song is definitely 'R.A.K.I.M.'  ... His flow is INSANE.<br />It really isn't a bad soundtrack, but something is just...lacking.
B000063V8U|5.0|&quot;Relics&quot;, &quot;Tapestry&quot;, &quot;Rascals&quot;, &quot;True Q&quot; are just SOME of the great episodes you'll find in this series. Truly an impressive season!
B000066NW0|2.0|Avril Lavigne is one of those artists who believes that music and self expression is easily achieved, my belief is that, though such a loose evolving step in music ( like much junk out there ), the music is so easy to digest and  to listen that it makes an unfair attempt in reveal her true persona, personally, if i were to listening punk i'd listen Black Flag ( of course, that IS punk )or the Exploited or the Birmingham Crass, but anyway that's something people does not see and therefore does not understand easily, so, buy it if you want, but do not expect a manifesto or a political or mental revolution
B000067CPX|5.0|A beautiful blend of melody and rock. Every track is worth listening to over and over. This is one of those CDs that you put on &quot;shuffle&quot; and enjoy. I will never hear enough of &quot;By They Way&quot;, and it is easily one of my favorite albums.
0783226063|1.0|For anyone who has read Frank Herbert's Dune, this Lynch adaptation is an absolute farce.  The star-studded cast notwithstanding, there is nothing redeeming about this movie.  I find it infinitely perplexing why and how anyone (including many reviewers here) would find the movie worth 5 minutes of your time - I surmise that no one would give this garbage more than one star if it not carry the Lynch name.
B000001GPX|5.0|A little history: Several years ago, when I was first starting to collect CDs, I picked up one that included Beethoven's Fifth and Seventh symphonies, as performed by the Cleveland Orchestra and conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi (ASIN: B000003CUR). Though I am hardly an aficionado of classical music, I knew enough to tell that although the performance and recording were technically proficient, they lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. I played the CD for an old friend who's much more knowledgeable about the genre than I am, and he articulated what was bothering me: \\"I don't think it's the orchestra,\\" he said. \\"It sounds like the conductor isn't cueing the tympani and the double basses forcefully enough -  there's no PUNCH there.\\"<br />Flash-forward several years: a couple months ago, my wife and I purchased a new stereo system. Curious to see what different genres of music sounded like on it, one of the first things I played on it was the Dohnanyi/Cleveland recording. Even though this system is much better than any I had previously owned, the CD still sounded sort of... blah. Now, if you're even vaguely familiar with these symphonies, you'll realize that LAST word one would normally use to describe them is \\"blah\\". This is particularly true of the Fifth. It should sound like the Revelation of Saint John the Divine scored for orchestra - almost unbearably intense.<br />I thought to myself, \\"This won't do at all\\". I then got on the net to check out good ol' Amazon.com in order to see what my other options were. After searching around a bit, I found this CD, which seemed to be considered, by Amazon and its customers alike, to be the more-or-less definitive recording of the Fifth and Seventh. I made a note of it.<br />Flash-forward again, this time about a month: I'm browsing through my local public library's music section and come across (you guessed it) the Kleiber/Vienna Philharmonic recording of the Fifth  and Seventh. I checked it out, went home, and promptly poppedit in the CD player.<br />Words cannot describe my immense satisfaction with what I heard.    YES! THIS was the apocalyptic music I had been searching for! Not only were the tympani and double basses my friend and I had mised very much present and accounted for, but the brass! There are brass parts on this recording that I had barely realized were THERE on the other one! And that was just the first movement of the Fifth! I honestly never really appreciated how beautiful these symphonies are until I heard this CD. Particularly outstanding on this recording, I think, is the second movement of the Seventh - just sublime. The first time I heard it, I literally sat there with tears in my eyes and chills running down my spine.<br />I have not yet purchased a copy of this brilliant recording, as it is not my practice to buy anything for myself during the holiday season, but you can bet it's on the top of my Wish List.<br />PS Just a tip - if you do obtain this CD, make sure to play it LOUDLY. ;)
0553573403|5.0|So I read the reviews here and decided to pick up the book..<br />Even the glowing reviews here don't do this book (or the one that follows) justice. Simply one of the most entertaining and addictive reads I've come across in years. I'm not even a huge fantasy fan but the world Martin created has got me hook, line and sinker. I go to bed thinking about the characters and eager to find out what befalls them the next day. Pure entertainment of the likes you'll rarely see.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I have been a fan of system since the 98 release of their self title, and every CD they have put out since has been phenomenal. Even those hard to find songs that have been released only on soundtracks and singles have been classics. I have seen these guys in concert several times, and everytime they get better. For any fan out there these guys are at the top of their game, and I recommend for anyone to buy this CD.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This one and especially Beggars Banquet are the two best sounding in the remaster series in my opinion along with either Aftermath US & UK and Satanic Majesties just because it is a ten fold improvement over the '86 \\" remasters \\" although not a recommended record for the casual Stones fan.  And this is just in the regular CD layer and not the SACD layer which I hope a SACD player drops down the chimney this XMAS.  I like the early Stones records a lot but I feel that as they grew as songwriters they were at their peak starting with Beggars and got even better when Mick Taylor joined the band after Brian Jones quit/fired.  I'll take Country Honk over Honky Tonk Women any day and Monkey Man is absolute killer. You must crank it up to the bass intro by Keith ( not Bill ) and a killer horn arrangement by Leon Russell on Live With Me.  Midnight Rambler really benefitted from the new remastering.  For those complaining about these CD's not being able to play on PC's, I ripped this onto my PC using Musicmatch 7.5 using my CD/RW and played the CD using the same drive.  My DVD-ROM drive would not read the disc.  I do not know about DVD burners if they can read these remasters as I do not own one at this time. I own all of the new remasters excluding the Hot Rocks compilations and have successfully ripped all of them. I HIGHLY recommend this record and Beggars as a starting point and then the very early CD's.  ENJOY!!!
B00005NP04|5.0|WOW!  What else is there to say.  The absolute best of Martina and country. Every song on the CD is strong.
0790736314|5.0|Why? It fulfills its goal as providing perhaps the most dreadful film of all time (emphasis on the word dreadful). There are no salvageable or redeeming qualities about this film.  All you will feel is utter dread, completely and in the most certain of ways. In that way, the film accomplishes its duty, providing, without question, one of the most hellish feelings in movie history. God's men do not prove more powerful in this tale and the film depicts the awesome idea of the sheer magnitude and might that the devil has at his disposure.<br />We see a gentle child, a girl no less, being possessed by sheer evil.  Take note, this is not just a murderous type of evil; it is a combination of evils: perversion, anti-God vulgarities, and so on.  When you are done with this film, you will question your own faith and decide if you yourself are suitable to take on such a monsterous force like a demon - even if you are a good Christian.<br />Proceed with extreme caution, this film will provoke you to dread and make you question your faith and your own view on the spiritual world. It gets an A+ for invoking those fears.
B000000WCA|4.0|All of their singles had been world wide hits - so far. But on this album are not so many good songs. Just the singles are great but you can forget the rest.  ANd if you like the songs you'll also be dissapointed because there are only 10 songs on it. So why 4 stars? As I said I like the 5 singles plus another song <BR>Wannabe: You know their first song don't you. It's still great.<BR>Say you'll be there: I also like this party song.<BR>2 become 1: Their first ballad. Meaningful lyrics about safer sex.<BR>Love thing: This is the only good song here that hadn't been a single.<BR>Last time lover: I guess this should sound like R n'B. But it's just boring.<BR>Mama: As the title says a song for all the Mamas out there.<BR>Who do you think you are: This is a typical Girl-Power song. Not bad. I like it.<BR>Something kinda funny: Like \\"Last time lover\\"<BR>Naked: This was a highlight at their concerts because they have worn skincolourd suits and so they looked like they were naked. But you can forget the song by itself<BR>If you can't dance: They don't sound good in this one. I don't like it.
B000020617|5.0|Hi everyone! I believe that the Foo Fighters are awesome and have great musical talents! Ecspecially the drums. Wow, they're great.  I found out about the Foo Fighters from my favorite tv show &quot;Ed&quot; and after that all I listen to is the song 'Next Year'. It's a great song.  I hope you get the CD because it really is rockin'.  Also if you would like to hear 'Next Year' tune in to &quot;Ed&quot; on NBC on Wednesday nights at 8/7 p.m. Get going to buy this great CD!!<br />Thank you Foo Fighters for letting the series &quot;Ed&quot; use the song 'Next Year'. It has been a blast!
B00005JKZ3|2.0|Men in Black 2 plays it utterly safe.  Even the couple of very minor gross outs are wanna-be's (the new Harry Potter film has a couple of scenes that are edgier than this one).  Will Smith still has lots of charm and charisma, but he doesn't get much of a script to work with here.  Tommy Lee Jones enters the film late, gets a few dead-pan laughs and he too doesn't get enough to say or do that's very interesting. Rip Torn blusters well in a coule of scenes, Laura Flynn Boyle is skinny and cartoonishly menacing, though there's no feeling of danger or suspense to any of it.  You wait to see a cool alien or laugh... and you don't laugh very much, I'm afraid.  Rick Baker and his team come up with some cool aliens, but 90 percent of the film is re-tread and what's worse it's watered down re-tread.  The 10 percent remaining aren't enough to make me want to purchase this one.  Heck it was barely worth sitting through once.<br />The commentary track is a pretty spirited fun listen thanks to Director Sonnenfeld's sometimes blue frankness,  but he has no shame and after Wild Wild West, the bomb about the bomb with Tim Allen, and this one, he's miles away from Get Shorty or Addams Family Values.<br />The series shouldn't have been this tired yet, but it is.  I mean Ghostbusters 2 was 10 times the sequel this one was and it was no great shakes.
B000002JPA|5.0|Most people would say that this band would be considered somewhat esoteric, maybe even too complicated and lengthy written to even 'tap a beat' to...but those same people probobly haven't even scratched the surface of what it means to experience the raw power, excellent precision, and incredible songwriting skills of Dream Theater.<BR>    I was introduced to Dream Theater about only a year and a half ago with their 25-minute epic \\"A Change of Seasons\\", and I have never listened to music the same way ever since then. First time I listened to it, I was inspired and in some forms startled by the music that had touched me forever. <BR>    A couple of weeks later, I had not only memorized \\"A Change of Seasons\\" perfectly, but I became a forever follower of the brilliant, exotic, and shimmering fills, rythems, and percussive theory of their drummer Mike Portnoy. His music and expertise had changed me forever; for being an accomplished drummer and musician myself, the compositions of Mike Portnoy and Dream Theater had improved my studies and views of the language of music forever.<BR>    From \\"Images and Words\\" to their newest \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\", I have never experienced a dull moment with the wonderfull music that these incredible musicians produce. I have now learned and memorized nearly every hit song of theirs, and that includes all instruments and lyrics. <BR>    Writing about \\"Images and Words\\", in the beginning I was skeptical about this older album of theirs, thinking that they might have had less experience of songwritting back in old '92...boy, I was sure wrong. I had started out listening to their newer records, such in order of my experience as follows: \\"A Change of Seasons\\" to \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" to \\"Awake\\" to \\"Metropolis pt.II: Scenes from a Memory\\". <BR>    Metropolis 2 had especially interested me, because of their \\"story-teller\\" format of the album. I had then once again listened to the album untill it was imprinted in my skull;knowing it BETTER than the back of my hand. Then, I noticed the song title \\"Metropolis Part I\\" on their \\"Images and Words\\" cd, which I had not yet gotten arround to listening to yet. I had then listened to it, and thought one thought: \\"Pure-Genius-Songwriting.\\" Simple as that. An even larger appreciation for both albums grew inside me like a weed. A true masterpiece.<BR>    \\"Images and Words\\" had changed my perspective again: Slightly older recording, but same hybrid style as their other albums. Every single song on that album is a work of art all by itself...and then once again, I memorize it. I play it. I live it.<BR>    It is quite a shame that the music of Dream Theater is popularly labled as \\"esotaric\\" as some smaller jazz bands or of the such. If people would give it even a small chance, they will find that their music tells a story and even some valuable morals. I do, however, respect their desire to stay somewhat 'under-exposed', for they see how the 'guts can hit the floor' in the world of over-premoted popular music: That is most definitley evident, BUT, I can promise anyone (I cannot emphisize A-N-Y-O-N-E enough) that the music of Dream Theater can change their life. How am I soo confident of this? Well, lets just say it has influenced everybody arround me: my faimily, friends, neighbors,...everyone that I have exposed Dream Theater to...as well as myself. For that I say 'Thankyou' to my good friends Allen and Colin. <BR>    I hope the reader of this review takes my veiw into serious concideration: I promise you, it will change your life.<BR>    with up-most appreciation,<BR>           -Stephen<BR>            Dallas, Tx, U.S.A.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one of the rare CD's to come out thats actually enjoyable from start to finish. My over-used Skip button has only recently been pressed a few times while listening to a couple of the weaker tracks on this CD (\\"A Whisper\\", \\"Daylight\\"), but even these arn't bad, just so-so. <br />When I first started listening to this band years ago I never thought they would get so mainstream, with all the Eminem kind of [stuff] most people listen to, I didn't think this kind of mellow rock would work, but apparently it does. This new album is even better than the first in my opinion, and the first ranks right up there with Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\", Nirvana Unplugged, and a few select others, among my all time favorites.<br />I think \\"Green Eyes\\" is way underrated, and really a great song, perhaps because its one I can actually play, but also much like \\"Amsterdam\\" and other songs on here, its one you really have to listen to all the way through a couple times before you really appreciate it.<br />All in all, this CD is defenitlely worth buying even if you're like me and you dont buy CD's. And if you like it, you should defenitly give their Single CD's (\\"Brothers & sisters\\", \\"shiver\\", \\"blue room\\") a listen, they're quite good also.
B00005RGWQ|4.0|This remaster is definitely worth picking up. A huge improvement over Deadly Sting. All the songs have an increase in sound quality, in all areas. The only flaw is some static, which is pretty much in the same places as on Deadly Sting. Great liner notes too, talking about problems in the band at the time, the demands of the producer, and opposition to digital recording. If you've never had this album before, this is the version to buy for sure.
B00000IONU|5.0|The essence of the White Sripes are captured in Jack White's smooth guitar riffs and Meg White's childishly comforting drumbeats.  They are both released in this fantastic collection of classic white stripes songs and blues covers .  My personal favoite tracks on this album are &quot;Cannon&quot;, which features a great cover of Son House's &quot;John the Revelator&quot;, &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;, a great cover of blues great Robert Johnson's original, and &quot;Broken Bricks&quot;, featuring a fast-paced guitar rhythm by guitar master Jack White.  This album is a definite must buy for any White Stripes fan and any modern blues fan!  go buy now!
B00005Q66M|3.0|Don't think many people need an introduction to the album, so I'll go ahead with the quality. I believe I also placed a review earlier, but it might have been under the wrong version. Basically the sound quality absolutely kills Deadly Sting. Totally demolishes. The only problem is that the remastering exploses some flaws, and there's clicks in track 2 similar to those in some Priest remasters.<br />Hey You is also different then the old Rockers N Ballads cd. For one, it's cut to 3:40. The other part is that it sounds a lot less organized. It kinda goes all over the place, and the vocals sound like they're barely competing with the music. They're much easier to hear on the old cd. Hopefully that one will sound better when I get that remaster.
B00005JLEX|1.0|Greed and stupidity.  Those are the 2 reasons Seinfeld hasn't made it to DVD. In the old days Movie execs were afraid of Video, now they make billions off them, much more than they make of the theatrical releases.  TV execs are afraid that syndication deals will go bad if the DVD comes out. Think of the comercial bucks lost if we all have our own Seinfeld versions.<br />  Note:  I would give this DVD a higher rating if it existed
B00005Q66M|3.0|I originally typed a review out for this, but mistakenly put it under the old US remastered version. I'll give a shortened one here. The sound quality is a HUGE improvement. It kills Deadly Sting. It's much louder, bigger, more clarity, and a huge improvement in bass. The only drawback is the same kind of clicking present on some Priest remasters that appears on track 2 during a couple verses. It repeats and is somewhat distracting, probably more total clicks on this song then all the clicks combined from the whole set of Priest remasters. There's also the standard static and tape hiss flaws that seem to be showing up on remasters done after 99.
B000066JES|4.0|Manowar's the one band you can always count on to never overthink themselves. Every time I want to just have a good time and rock out, I'll reach for a Manowar CD. Who cares if they say metal or die every other word... they're freakin Manowar they can do that.<br />Warriors of the World is alot better than Louder than Hell, relying on the old 80s formula... huge choruses, heavy riffs, and lots of cheese. Warriors of the World United has to be the best song they've come up with since Hail and Kill... look at how big it is in Germany. This is no frills 100 % WARRIOR METAL and a cool album.<br />I could do w/out the lame opera covers and the American Trilogy tripe though.
B00005Q66N|5.0|I'm new to the pre-Savage Amusement portion of the Scorps career, even though I've owned Rockers N Ballads and Face the Heat since 93, and then Crazy World, Savage Amusement, Live Bites, Best of the Ballads, since 95, and Pure Instinct in 96. I did have some of the old albums on LP, but never paid them much attention till recently, and decided to get these remastered cds.<br />The sound quality kills on this album, absolutely destroys Deadly Sting, which I recently bought off [online aution] for $... It literally jumps out at you. The fact that the band is absolutely on fire and full of energy also really helps these songs come alive. <br />This is probably one of the very few consistent Scorps albums. All the songs are at least good, with quite a few great ones. Cool liner notes too. Highly Recommended.
B000002IRL|5.0|Horrorscope is one of those rare albums where each song is as good as the last. There are so many thrash classics on here that naming them all is pointless.. Thanx for Nuthin, Horrorscope, Bare Bones, Coma... even the power ballad (Soulitude) rocks hard. And not to mention their cover of Frankenstein. <br />My favorite thing about Horrorscope though has to be the killer production. The guitar tone is suitably crunchy and Mr. Verni's bass rings out clear as a bell. <br />Most fans seem to agree... Horrorscope rules.
B000002A3T|4.0|When first hearing The Division Bell you get an awkward feeling because it's not quite like the other great albums.  This album is different and you must warm up to it.  Many people will try to say its not that good because it was made in the 90s or other reasons but this album is very good.  It shows just as much musical talent as Dark Side of the Moon with less effects.  It's a cleaner Floyd album but never the less it's great.
B000002ITM|3.0|Keep in mind that a band with a pedigree like Testament's worst album is still better than most metal releases. The Ritual was their response to the early 90s trend of swapping thrash metal for a more user friendly direction, ala Metallica and Megadeth. In the 80s Testament were just short of mainstream success achieved by their &quot;big 4&quot; peers, and I suppose the Ritual was a (label influenced??) attempt to capitalize on metal's newfound marketability.<br />Electric Crown is a killer song with a great chorus and solo, but unfortunately one of the most upbeat tracks on the album. This is my main point of contention w/ the Ritual... it's too slow. The riffs are there, but they drag along and don't hold my attention long enough. <br />Return to Serenity is the second high point of the album, an amazing ballad with beautiful guitar work, perhaps Testament's shining hour songwriting wise. After the Ritual they booted Alex Skolnick and released &quot;Low&quot; the heaviest and arguably best record of their career, avoiding the downwards creative spiral suffered by those two &quot;M&quot; bands <br />Testament rules
B000002BYD|4.0|On pearl jam's 5th album we find doing a more grounded,more old shcool style album. Unlike the experimental elements of \\"vitology\\" and \\"no code\\", with yeild we find a more mellow version of pearl jam, with the exception of 6 some odd songs. Of course yeild has it's share of duds, it has it's share of in my opoion, pearl jams best tunes to date. Yeild not only being one of my favorote rock albums and my 3rd favorite pearl jam album starts off with tunes such as \\"brain of J\\" and \\"faithfull\\". What better way to start off a rock/alternative album with two very impressive tunes? While \\"no way\\" reminds me of something off of vitology, that song really to this day does not impress me. But \\"given to fly\\", well besides from sounding eirly like led zepplins \\"going to calliforinia\\" is awsome, with full of emotion vocals from ed vedder(as he now calls himself)and very rythimic guitars. While the middle part of the album pretty much falls into very mellow ballads, mostly acoustic oriented. Tunes such as \\"whishlist\\" \\"pilate\\", both of witch are pretty good, and wishlist as being probably one of pearl jams most flamboyant songs next to \\"even flow\\". Then you get into the later half of yeild and goes pretty much with the same formula, but definetly has some very nice tunes such as the laid back ballads \\"MFC\\" \\"lowlight\\" and \\"all those yesterdays\\". While \\"in hidning\\" as being one of my all time favorite pearl jam tunes with it's mellow/rocking formula and at the end a very neat little riff. I would definetly recomend yeild to new pearl jam fans and rock fans alike.
B000002J0G|5.0|Testament's \\"Low\\" along with Machinehead's first record set the table for todays' movement of bludgeoningly heavy modern thrash. The production is thick, Chuck's vocals lean towards death metal at times, and JAMES FREAKIN MURPHY is on lead guitar. Low is METAL personified.<br />There's an interesting story about how Atlantic records asked Testament to record something \\"alternative\\" in the midst of the whole early 90s grunge movement.. and they sent back Dog Faced Gods.... gotta love that. This entire CD thrashes hard, highlights being Legions in Hiding and Shades of War, as well as the crushing title track. Even the instrumentals are cool and worth listening to<br />Well if you're a Testament fan and you're lacking this... WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
B000066NW0|3.0|I was playing the CD, and was shocked that It was mainly POP! Dont get me  wrong the cd is good, but if you would like a HOT New Album check out Kelly Osbourne's new album SHUT UP. A really nice addition to any collection!
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is a rather jolly recording from a female of the species with non-standard hair colour - actually that was all i could think of as i listened to the creative opus that has spewed forth from her pink loins. 'Get The Party Started' is a bouncey toon, but could do with some panada-power attitude remixing on the decks from yours truely. i would mash it up with some acid carrots and some cheese triangles that i read about in my book about cheese. hey how about some respect my beeatches?
B000077VPU|5.0|From Axel and Elton doing 'Rapsody' (strange pair, but OH how it worked) to Annie Lenox and David Bowie this tribute concert for one of the best front this business has ever seen is a MUST!  Wonderful to see Brian May play again.  This concert is some 11 years old now...and I continue to wear out my VCR tape...THANK GOD it game out on DVD....George Michaels 'Sombody to Love' is worth the cost of the DVD on it's own.  buy it, you will not be sorry
6305508550|5.0|This DVD is a must for anyone who has ever worked a technical job or in any company that subjected its employees to the now ubiquitous &quot;cubicle farm.&quot;!
B000000Y59|5.0|This is the first of many great albums by this fabulous artist.  That is probably what's so amazing about it.  It has a very \\"finished\\" feel to it.  The interplay between LeFaro on bass and Evans is more a joint effort than first one, then the other, as was common in the 50s and before.  Evans preferred it this way.  And it changed the way jazz was played.  Talk about seminal work!  In any Evans collection, this is a must have item!
B000002KKS|5.0|Wow, what can I say... this record blew me away from the very first time i heard it on a music camp and it still does. The old sound of Black Sabbath is almost completely gone, so it should be better to call them Black Dio or something in that manner, cause its more like Dios former band Rainbow with Tony Iommis sensitive guitar. This creates the near to perfect mix with songs like Neon Knights, Children Of The Sea and of course, the exceptional, outstanding, fantastic epic title track. This is without a doubt Dios best work to date, mostly cause his bandcomrades really knew what they were doing, and he didnt get people with that caliber to his soloprojekt 3 years later. A must-have for tradition metal fans.
B0000024SD|5.0|He moves away from his folk roots and adds more rock and roll into his repetoire, which upset many of his fans. The half-electric half-acoustic album contains some of his best lyrics and best songs. &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; opens the album, and from here, it's the turning point for Dylan, and was the sign for things to come in his career. Other excellent songs include &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; &quot;It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding&quot; and &quot;Love Minus Zero.&quot;<BR><BR>This is second to Blonde on Blonde as Bob Dylan's greatest album, and it is certainly one of his definitive, and daring for the time, since it was unheard of in the folk community for a folk artist to plug in.

B0000028UK|5.0|VS is definitely one of the greatest albums Pearl Jam ever did. The playing and writing are solid, and it's actually an improvement from the blockbuster Ten, another great album. It's also more emotional, courtesy of Vedder's lyrics/vocals an the music goes together brilliantly with the music. Songs like &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;Daughter,&quot; &quot;WMA,&quot; &quot;Rearviewmirror,&quot; and the closer &quot;Indifference&quot; exemplify this. Pearl Jam's heaviest songs (Blood and Leash)also are effective and great as well. Recommended for any Pearl Jam fan who hasn't picked this album up yet.
B00006RU5B|1.0|You know what buyer's remorse is.  You've been plagued with it many times throughout your life.  It occurs most often when you are unsatisfied with something you have bought, and feel it was not worth what you paid.  Well, be warned, this album gave me a bad case of it.<br />Smartly, the CD starts of with the best song \\"Cochise.\\"  Cochise is a great single, but it is not great enough to carry the album, because it is all downhill from here.  None of the other songs are anything special.  There are some that are better than the rest, but that doesn't make them good.  In fact, none of the songs stood out well enough for me to even remember which were the ones I liked better than the others, even though I listened to the album three times!  Yes, three times.  You can't say I didn't give Audioslave a fair chance.  Another thing is that I was predisposed to like this CD!  I had downloaded several songs from the internet in order to preview the CD, and I liked what I heard. Not only that, but I was also totally sucked in by Storm Thorgerson's art (he also did most of the cover art for my favorite band, Pink Floyd).  I should have just kept the mp3s.<br />Now, I know that many of you are going to get mad that I don't like this CD, and that is ok.  Some people may like this kind of music, but this is my opinion and as far as music goes, everyone's opinion varies.  There may be people who will enjoy this CD very much, but I cannot fathom it.  This album is not only bad when compared to the really brilliant music currently being made by the band's contemporaries, but it is also bad when taken as a completely separate entity.  It does not even justify it's own purchase price, and I own several pairs of socks that more than accomplish that.<br />One thing that may help when you are thinking of buying this album - yes it does sound a lot like Soundgarden.  It sounds more like Soundgarden than Rage Against the Machine, but that doesn't mean that the Rage sound is totally lost - it is not.  It is like a Soundgarden album with Tom Morello-influenced music, only it has less good songs than Soundgarden's albums contained.<br />In the end, this is a below average disc.  Being aware that sometimes you need to let music sink in to like it, I gave it three full listens, and didn't like it.  If you are looking to buy some music in this genre, I would suggest instead that you check out Source Tags and Codes, the new album by Trail of Dead.  Pound for pound, song for song, it is light years better than this hyped tripe.  Audioslave was not worth the 2 and a half hours of work that it ultimately cost me to buy it, and I would hate for you to waste the same amount of time and effort.
0671688782|5.0|I am a mom with two daughters and one son. I recently read (and reread and reread!) the book Holding Time and I am very excited that this technique to helped my youngest daughter (she was 2 in August) more firmly attach to me. She experienced great distress when my husband and I left to adopt our son. The technique worked exactly as described in the book, with my daughter.  She cried/screamed/struggled for about an hour, then there was a wonderful resolution.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I created this Amazon account just to give my 2 cents on this album. It's truly an original, and a much needed break from the ever increasingly similar sounds of other mainstream rock bands.<br />Everything else has been said by other reviews. Don't let the negative perceptions deter you, as with nearly any CD review on Amazon, there's always a few that don't find it appealing.
B00006CXXU|4.0|this cd is really good if u don't like it just try listening to the songs and u will learn that this cd is preety good.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The title of this review says it all.  This album has literally changed my life.  It's the most inspirational, beautifully constructed, original album that I have ever heard.  And it's about pink robots!  Don't ask me how the Flaming Lips managed to pull that off, but they did.  I have flat out never heard a song superior to &quot;Do You Realize??&quot;  The &quot;musical chorus&quot; to &quot;In the Morning of the Magicians&quot; gives me chills every time I hear it.  &quot;Fight Test&quot; is a perfect song.  Every track is an essential one.  Other than the previously mentioned songs, my favorites are &quot;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell&quot;, &quot;It's Summertime&quot; and of course, &quot;Yoshimi, Pt. 1.&quot;  They are all 5-star, amazingly original, perfect songs.  Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.  I cannot recommend an album more strongly than I recommend this one.  Buy this album.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|i am not one of those reviewers that just writes a sentence or two about the movie that is stupid and unhelpful.  <br />But this is just a bad, bad, boring movie, and that is simply all to say.
0131103628|5.0|This book is simply the best. The author provides so much information for such a small book. If you are a beginner then it is a little hard to understand because there is so much information in such a small book, but if you try hard and work the exercises you will get it. I know this isn't a real good \\"review\\", but it doesn't need one. Just buy it.
B00004Z459|4.0|i don't dislike much about this cd, except for the fact that the 12 tracks only add up to 38 minutes of music. even so, the music is some of the best i've ever heard. synopsis:<br />1 - papercut-it's about paranoia, and lp says it's the best song that fits them. i usually skip it, but it's good. 8.5/10<BR>2 - one step closer-SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKIN TO YOU! a fairly big radio hit, powerful song that i can relate to, and chester's screaming makes it great. 9/10<BR>3 - with you-lots of djing...people have different ideas of what it's about. 8.5/10<BR>4 - points of authority-mostly rock, with little rap! woo! 8.5/10<BR>5 - crawling-first time i saw the video, i was terrified...it is a creepy, powerful song, but very good. 9/10<BR>6 - runaway-about wanting to run away from problems in your life...cool intro. 8.5/10<BR>7 - by myself-about fearing someone...my least favorite song on the whole album. 6.5/10<BR>8 - in the end-i love this song! great musical quality. however, many big lp fans understandably don't like it...it was WAY TOO COMMERCIALIZED and all over mtv and the radio, causing teenyboppers *shudder* to like lp for one song. if it had never come out, though, i would never have liked lp! 10/10<BR>9 - a place for my head-about being taken advantage of...i think. i like the whisper-scream part at the end though! 8.5/10<BR>10 - forgotten-chester does some great singing at the end, and it's generally a good song. 9.5/10<BR>11 - cure for the itch-a mixing track with very few words, by the dj joe hahn. it's cool, but i like the remix's darkness better. 8.5/10<BR>12 - pushing me away-everything falls apart/even the people who never frown/eventually break down...i used to hate this song until i really listened to the lyrics. one of my most favorite songs. 9.5/10
0060920084|3.0|Certainly not Bryson's best. But I still love his ever present cynicism. I felt he was a lot more negative in this book than in \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\\" . Which deals with some of the same topics. <br />If you are an avid Bryson reader, then yes do take the time and read it. However do not expect for it to live up to some of his other works.
B000069CWE|4.0|(note that this is my first review, and i am only 13!)<BR>when i heard that linkin park was doing a remix album, i was thrilled. i finally got it about 3 months after it came out, and i'm pretty satisfied with it. i am not a rap fan, unlike most  people i know, but i think that the way that lp blends hip-hop with rock is awesome. i'll give a bit on my personal favorites:<br />p5hing me a*wy (track 6)-very powerful, with awesome new verses...and the backwards lyrics are the coolest!<BR>kyur4 th ich (track 18)-in my opinion, waaay better the original...very dark & techno-ish<BR>1stp klosr (track 19)-except for the fact that it takes nearly 2 minutes to get to the actual singing, it's an awesome song. jon davis has a powerful, creepy voice and i enjoy the \\"SHUT UP!\\" part.<BR>krwlng (track 20)-chester bennington + aaron lewis = prolly the best collaboration on the album...very creepy...<br />i can understand why some people wouldn't like this-it is pretty different from hybrid theory. if you're a very huge lp fan-like myself!-or if you are more into the rap part of lp, i think you'll enjoy this album.
B000002HMH|1.0|The title of the album says it all,it's a load alright.<BR>What ever happened to the days where they were playing<BR>speed metal? Us true die hard fans know that the last<BR>real heavy best album they did was And justice for all.<BR>Some people think we don't like them anymore because<BR>they're not playing speed metal.No you got it wrong,<BR>musically they are selling out and playing what <BR>Bob rock wants them to play.You don't have to sell<BR>out to make money and to be on the radio.Look at bands<BR>like Slayer,they are still playing speed metal and have<BR>been from day one.even though you don't hear them on the<BR>radio but they will never sell out.Pantera is still playing<BR>what they have been from the beginning but as times change<BR>they make the styles they play sound new and fresh and staying<BR>away from the 80's metal sound.They are still playing <BR>thrash,hardcore and some speed metal but they will never<BR>sell out.Slipknot is another example,they play speed and <BR>thrash metal and get alot of radio play and they haven't<BR>sold out yet.Mudvaine is another example they get alot of<BR>radio play and they haven't sold out to anyone yet.<BR>I'm a musician my self and if I ever make it big I tell<BR>you this, nobody is going to tell me what to play<BR>and what not to play.I'm not going to be a sell out,<BR>it is my goal to make all the money I want by playing<BR>what my self and my band members want to play.It's a<BR>a real waste of talent that Metallica had to sell out.
B000069RPC|4.0|I think that linkin park have just given out a brilliant remix album. Nearly all the songs are really good and original, with deep lyrics and platinum hip-hop beats. Some of the remixes are actually better then original versions, like frgt/10, 1stp klosr and krwling with a new classical sounding keyboard background melody. When this record just came out, I got it right away anticipating to listen to all the new songs. It did not fail to please me. The lyrics like &quot;when I look into your eyes, there is nothing there to see...nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me...&quot; really surprised me with their meaning. The mix between nu metal &amp; hip-hop is just what can take you into a different place, the place to escape from today!<BR>I think that the most sucsessful track is frgt/10 with the breathless rapping by Mike Shinoda &amp; chali 2na. The beat all the way through the song is amazing, and I will never get board of listening to this song. <BR>The rap by underground artists supported by guitar riffs really fits in on all the songs, apart from plc.4 mie haed and h!vltg3 which is the worst song on the album with its annoying triple symbal beat and the loud keyboard background.<BR>Also the filling between tracks are pretty annoying, although they are meant to have some sort of message, I just don't get it and its really annoying to get up and skip them all the time. <BR>Anyway, i think that linkin park still didnt lose their touch, and looking forward to getting their next album.
B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax is one of my all time favorite metal<BR>bands.Among the living is in my opinion their<BR>heaviest album.Every song on here is awesome<BR>Among the living,Caught in a mosh,Indians,Skeletons<BR>in the closet,N.F.L.,I am the law,One world,Horror<BR>of it all and Immitation of life are all awesome songs.<BR>Trust me you got to own this one,for every metal head<BR>that doesn't own this album you gotta buy it now.

B00006EXDM|5.0|Hot Rocks covers the first chapter of the Rolling Stones' career. In the period from 1964 to 1971, the Rolling Stones dominated the pop charts as much as The Beatles did.<br />Disc 1 covers 1964 to 1967. From the megahit cover of Times Is On My Side to a string of Jagger/Richards originals like Satisfaction, Get Off Of My Cloud, and Under My Thumb. As Tears Go By is a complete Yesterday rip-off but I like it even better. The Beatles tune is missing something this song has. Ruby Tuesday is a beautiful physcadellic ballad that capsulizes the summer of love beautifully. A wonderful four-minute pop single with a breath of majesty. Paint It Black is another physcadellic<br />effort that is great. Now on disc 2.<br />Kickin off with the searing riff to Jumpin' Jack Flash, they evolve from mere teenage idols to accomplished and mature musicians writing intelligent and astute lyrics. Some of these lyrics were overtly political and address social issues, such as 1968's Street Fighting Man, which was banned since it was released in the wake of the Chicago riots. Gimme Shelter is a flame-engulfed drug anthem. Kicking off with a chilling tremelo rhythm, the song rocks. Mick even plays harp on it. You Can't Always Get What You Want is probably my favorite song. It is a pretty song with a lovely choir leading it in. Midnight Rambler<br />is the live version from Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out is amazing. It is over 9 minutes long. No other band can play that long live on one song. The versions of Brown Sugar and Wild Horses are not the single versions. They're different versions. Also check out Honky Tonk Women. It rocks ! So does the rest of the album.
B000002J09|5.0|People are gonna talk. Theyll tell you its an overated album, that its just Stairway to Heaven and maybe 2 other songs. But these people are wrong.

B0000027RL|5.0|There is a record company adage that says, \\"A band has its whole life to make its first record, and six months to make its second.\\" For Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, the life leading up the band's first record, 1991's \\"Ten,\\" was one of childhood confusion and emotional struggle. The result was a powerfully driven and kinetic album that, along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" fixated the eyes of the music world on Seattle and cemented the band's place in rock history. It also created an influential template for the Scott Stapp's and Aaron Lewis's of the world.<br />Though the band was labeled as \\"grunge\\" because of its geography, \\"Ten\\" is musically closer to Bad Company or Jim Morrison than it is to \\"Badmotorfinger\\" or Mudhoney. Guitarist Stone Gossard's brawny, blues-based riffs on \\"Evenflow,\\" \\"Porch\\" and \\"Alive,\\" can all trace their fuzz-toned roots right to Jimmy Page and Aerosmith's Joe Perry. Guitarist Mike McCready also bows frequently to guitar gods like Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. The band's more commercial arena rock vibe drew criticism from many, including a wary Kurt Cobain. Still, it is undeniable that Gossard and McCready's nimble and aggressive contrapuntal guitar work sent many aspiring young musicians scrambling to their local guitar shops.<br />And then there is Vedder, the surfer-turned-reluctant-spokesperson for a generation. Vedder's lyrics float through waves of emotion, most notably in \\"Jeremy\\" and the semi-autobiographical \\"Alive,\\" its triumphant chorus betraying the conflict and disappointment of a mother informing her child of a harsh family truth. But the true apex of the album is \\"Black,\\" a searing song of lost love that encapsulates 90s rock at its best: brooding, honest and poignant. When Vedder wails, \\"I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a sun in somebody else's sky, but why, why can't it be mine\\" it comes from a place that must be pure experience.<br />Despite, but more likely because of, \\"Ten's\\" commercial success,Pearl Jam have not made another album that carries the same angst or slick production values. Their six studio albums since have taken decidedly varied musical paths, leaving it to the imitators to attempt to recreate what made \\"Ten\\" one of the most celebrated and iconic albums of the 90s.
B000002ADT|5.0|If there's one jazz album in the world that doesn't need my two cents worth, it's Kind Of Blue.  But I thought I'd throw in an interesting bit of info for the musicians out there.  For twenty-five years, I struggled to retune my guitar to play along with the original vinyl issue of KOB, trying to pick up the the great modal scales and sequences used by Davis, Adderly, Coltrane, Chambers, and Evans.  A major pain, as any musician who's tried to do the same will testify, due to the fact that even though Miles wrote and the group performed, for example, &quot;So What&quot; using the basic chords/keys of D-minor 7th and E-flat-minor 7th, the album, when played on a stereo, came out largely in the keys of D-minor 7th + 5/8ths and E-flat-minor 7th + 3/5ths, or some such incomprehensible bizarrity.  This out-of-tuneness, it turns out, was due to a mixing error back in 1959 that SPED THE MASTER TAPE UP--changing the pitch.  And I blamed my turntable and tape deck all those years.  To the point: this reissue, with an alternate take of &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; included, has been remastered at the proper speed, so that the key of D-minor actually sounds like--ta dahhh!--D-MINOR!  So, thanks to the engineers who remastered this classic, and to all those musicians out there who thought they had suddenly developed a tin ear when listening to Kind Of Blue . . . you didn't.
B000000WA4|5.0|I can't believe I didn't used to like The Smashing Pumpkins, well, actually, I had just never listened to any of their music. I downloaded every album from them on my computer, they're all spectacular, but this is the first one I listened to. This album goes right up there with Garbage's \\"Version 2.0\\". Both of these albums have changed my life. They're made me see music in a new light, and made me get new role models. Billy Corgan is, by far, the best male singer in the world. A lot of people think he has a whiney, annoying voice, but it's that voice that makes every song he sings into pure heaven. I have been so inspired by Billy and the rest of the Pumpkins, they're incredible.<BR>The songs:<br />Disc 1<br />Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness- A beautiful classical piece. I love this song, it's some of the best piano player I've ever heard.<br />Tonight, Tonight-Not my favorite song, but it's very good. The video for this song is so cool.<br />Jelly Belly-I love this song. I love all their songs. But this is a very good song<br />Zero-My favorite Smashing Pumpkins song EVER! This song is perfect, I love it.<br />Here Is No Why-I love the lyrics to this song. It's perfect<br />Bullet With Butterfly Wings-This songs chorus has so much anger in it. Which makes it an awesome song.<br />To Forgive-A sad, slow song. I really like this one too<br />... (An Ode to No One)-Billy Corgan called this song pure frustration. He says it's the song based on that mood you can be in when you're like \\"... my friends. ... everything\\" I looovvvee this song.<br />Love-I also love this song. I love every song though. Every song is great<br />Cupid De Locke-I love this song too. It's very classical and beautiful. Unlike most songs dissing Cupid, this one is kind of giving him credit.<br />Galapagos-Another slow song. Billys voice is very transitional, it can go from loud to soft, which makes him a great artist. Good song<br />Muzzle-VERY good song, the lyrics are amazing<br />PorcelinaOf The Vast Oceans-This song is very beautiful, it's also a little sad. But very good, of course<br />Take Me Down-I think this is my least favorite song on the album. It's just kind of boring. It's good, but boring.<br />Disc 2<br />Where Boys Fear to Tread-Amazingly loud guitar playing, great lyrics, a little bit of anger, what else do you need? Great song<br />Bodies-Very good song. I can't explain how it is, but it's very good.<br />Thirty-Three-A slow song, but it's good.<br />In THe Arms of Sleep-Slow song..Good song<br />I'll do the rest later<br />TERRIFIC ALBUM!
B000069CWE|4.0|there are so many damn reviews so if you happen to read this i say this is great. Its quite different from Hybrid Theory. Its more hip-hop and rap-ish but if ya like the type of music go buy the friggin cd. I havent bought it yet but from hearing the samples of oints Of Authority and En TH nd (or h.e. u spell it) are great. I think it rox even tho it doesnt have a really rock sound. lotsa ppl may dissagree but i dont know what else to say. I love the new hip-hop-ish vibe in the songs. Unlike others i believe this IS worth your money. Just buy it and if ya dont like it go sell it on Ebay and get some of you precious dough back. I would. Dammit...i want this disc badly. Buy let me tell ya a lil secret...i dont know the band members names or much about em but muh freind had hybrid theory so um...i fell in love with it and intend to buy that too. so start with hybrid theory but i dont give so just go on...BUY IT!!
B00007K06Q|4.0|The movie is quite beautiful. The scenery alone is worth watching! Lush might be a better word; in many ways, it is what you would expect - and hope for - in a film version of Hesse's famous novel. If you have never read the book, be warned: it is not a fast-paced film. It is a story of finding &quot;the true way&quot; and the discovery that comes along with this. My only true disappointment came at the end when the scene between Siddhartha and Govinda did not meet my expectations - aside from that, I recommend it!

B00005UOKM|3.0|I've always been a little puzzled by the reputation of this album, which is regarded with something like awe by Blue Note aficionados.  It's of course a landmark in the label's experiment in the 1960s with avantgarde jazz, & is also notable as being Hutcherson's first disc as a leader, & as fielding what's basically the house \\"avantgarde\\" team: Hutcherson, Hill, Hubbard, Rivers, Davis, Chambers.  Between them these musicians appeared in various combinations on classics of the period such as Dolphy's _Out to Lunch_, Hill's _Point of Departure_ & Moncur's _Evolution_.<br />& yet I find this an album easier to admire than love (unlike those last three discs I named).  Part of the problem is that often the musicians are on instruments I don't especially enjoy hearing them on.  Sam Rivers is on flute for two tracks, bass clarinet for one (the long title-track); & Hutcherson is using marimba for half the album.  \\"Catta\\" is the strongest, most distinctive composition here, the creation of Andrew Hill: it's in 8/8 time, with a grinding repetitive piano accompaniment which is actually often rather more absorbing than the solos over top of it (Rivers is in rather middling form here; Hubbard & Hutcherson much better). The dissonantly harmonized waltz \\"Idle While\\", the soulful \\"Ghetto Lights\\" & the quite straightforward blues \\"Jasper\\" (an outtake from the session, for some reason--it could easily have fit on the original LP) are likeable; but I find the two \\"free\\" tracks, \\"Les Noirs Marchant\\" & \\"Dialogue\\", rather tough going.  They are interesting for being quite unlike what anyone else what doing in free jazz at that moment, their spacious interplay anticipating European free-improv rather than being at all like the work of Ayler, Coleman & Coltrane.  Still, almost 17 solid minutes of this rather fugitive interplay bogs the album down somewhat.<br />A \\"classic\\" I suppose, but it's one that seems to me ultimately almost time-locked.  Still, with most of Hutcherson's Blue Notesenjoying only brief lives in the catalogue before they disappear, it's certainly worth acquiring.  Curious how the careers of these players were so soon to diverge, with Hutcherson & Hubbard never sounding this adventurous again after the 1960s, while Rivers & Hill continued on their stubbornly independent musical paths.
0066214122|4.0|It's 2009 and Jack Forman, software whiz at Media Tronics, is fired the day after he tells his lawyer about the corruption at the company.  Pretty much blackballed in Silicon Valley, Jack functions as a stay at home dad while his wife Julia pursues a high-powered career in venture capital working on the Xymos deal.  Xymos bills itself as the world leader in molecular manufacturing and is marketing its ability to create nanoparticles that can be injected into the bloodstream and project images of everything they pass through in the human body.  This is all in the first twenty-two pages.<br />For the next hunderd pages or so the story bogs down, weaving together the tension in Jack and Julia's marriage with a lot of scientific backdrop for the climax to come.  Then the action shifts to the Xymos plant in the Nevada desert where the nanoparticles are being produced.  Jack is brought out to fix some software that Media Tronics created for Xymos and discovers that the nanoparticles have taken on a life of their own.  From here on you can just imagine the special effects in the movie that will ultimately be made.  Jack goes from one impossible situation to the next in his effort to save the world from the evils of a scientific miracle gone awry.<br />Enjoy the action for what it is, but don't get too hung up on Crichton's message that advances in computer and biotechnology may converge to precipitate the end of the world.
B00004W19V|1.0|Struck by lightning, a powerful battle robot achieves consciousness and escapes from its creator.  Pursued by the military, Number 5, as it is called, is befriended by a sweet-natured animal-loving numbskull (Ally Sheedy), the robot's reclusive inventor (Steve Guttenberg), and an offensive East Indian stereotype (Fisher Stevens).  This is a very bad movie.  Unlike so many other reviewers on this page, I found it to be dull and mechanical, a by-the-numbers production with a clunky and unappealing robot at its center, filled with stock characters that do and say exactly what you think they will because you've seen it all a million times before.  Boo.  I was shocked that the screenwriters, Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson, are the same people who would go on to write the B-movie classic, \\"Tremors.\\"  They obviously improved over time.
0553382179|5.0|Let me tell you that I didn't believe in anything of this when I first joined the e-mail list. Somebody had mentioend it to me and I just wanted to give it a try, but shining the sink as the first step to happiness sounded a bit weird. Strangely though it worked. I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I used to when buying some book on getting organized and wondering how in the world I would be able to do everything that was mentioned. (Some of the books were wonderful to read, but I just couldn't integrate them into my life.) No, it all started with small steps, and shining the sink in the evening actually made me chuckle about this little secret nobody in my family knew about. Some weeks later even my husband noticed that some things had changed, that the kitchen seemed tidier, that I seemed to do more things than I had been doing, etc. Well, our house isn't perfect and never will be, but anybody can come in any minute now and I'm not embarrassed, I usually know exactly where things are, and I developed some routines that really help me doing things without even thinking about them. Even the time I spend surfing on the internet has greatly diminished, because I seem to be managing my time much better now and thus have time for things I'm really interrested in, like learning a musical instrument... To put it short, if you're one of those people who are afraid they never will get to that point of being organized, or feeling comfortable in their home, buy this book, or alternatively, subscribe to that e-mail list, because it's doable. I did it - you can do it, too.
B00000099Y|5.0|TOOL. There is little to say about this album other than that it is an absolute must-have for anyone who expects more from music than a toe-tapping rhythm.  This is an album to sink your teeth into and a doorway to infinite possibilities.  Explore it at will.

6304806426|1.0|That's right. Negative five stars. Why? Number one: The acting. I did not like it. In fact, you could call the acting bland. Number two: The ACTOR. Ralph Fiennes is pronounced \\"Rife Fines\\"? Come on! He is merely trying to cover up a common pauper's name, pronounced as it is spelled, \\"Ralf Feens\\". This guy made Red Dragon almost unbearable. In fact, you could even say that Mr. Feinnes is the cause for all evil in the world. That is all I have to say for this overrated piece..., which shll be known forever as The English Patient. Case closed.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|\\"Thriller\\" isn't simply the greatest selling album of all time. To evaluate an album of this magnitude solely on sales doesn't begin to do it justice. It literally turned the music industry on its head, and it ignited a cultural revolution I haven't seen in my 30+ years on this earth. \\"Thriller\\" changed the way we listen to music, it jumpstarted MTV culture, and it took Michael Jackson's celebrity to astonishing heights that not even he could handle. But on its very own merits, \\"Thriller\\" is still an excellent album flawlessly crafted by producer Quincy Jones and Jackson. The opener, \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',\\" the crossover rock jam \\"Beat It,\\" the funky \\"P.Y.T.,\\" the signature hit \\"Billie Jean,\\" and the stomping title track are nothing short of perfect. Even the somewhat sappy duet with Paul McCartney \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" has a playful sweetness that you can't resist. But I think \\"Thriller\\"'s most underrated track is the closing ballad \\"The Lady in My Life,\\" an album cut that's just as good as the seven (yes, seven) tracks that were released as singles. In 2001, Sony reissued \\"Thriller\\" as a \\"special edition.\\" While this release is said to be remastered, the sound quality is virtually identical to the previous CD version, and that's not a bad thing. For a 1982 album, both versions project remarkably well, with booming bass and impressive clarity. But what really sets this \\"special edition\\" apart is the bonus material that follows this album which clocks at over 70 minutes. We get interviews with Quincy Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton who discuss \\"Thriller\\"'s making, the conception of certain tracks, and so forth. Some comments are more useful than others, but I thought both Jones and Temperton helped provide a somewhat intimate look at the making of this recording. Also, we get some additional tracks. \\"Someone in the Dark\\" is a ballad that I personally thought was pretty forgettable. We also have a rough demo version of \\"Billie Jean\\" with slightly different lyrics. Vincent Price also drops by in the form of a voice-over session for the song \\"Thriller.\\" The last track is \\"Carosel,\\" originally recorded for the album but was eventually dropped. It's actually a pretty decent tune, and I personally believed it would have fit into the rest of the album nicely. Sony clearly gave this album the royal treatment, and deservedly so since it is a definite and untouchable 1980s classic. While Jackson would suffer a slow and steady transformation into self-parody, there's no denying his status as a legend. This album, even after 20 years, remains a thriller.ics.

B00006CXXU|4.0|not being too fond of the pop music that's been coming out lately, i wasn't too sure what to think of the new christina. yeah, i knew she had an amazing voice, her songs were good enough, especially compared to all the other radio pop, but she was still one of those mouseketeers. with all that in mind, i approached this one delicately. and i can honestly say that i'm quite impressed with it. she's matured quite a bit since her last cd. and apparently decided to get some personal stuff off of her chest. i may not be too fond of her image lately, but she does appear to be showing the real christina on this cd, and it's not at all as bad as you may be thinking. you may like it, you may hate it, but i'm sure that along the way you'll find something truly great about it. just give it a chance. she's worked hard enough for that.

B0000062Y2|4.0|While I certainly respect everyone's right to like or dislike the motion picture soundtrack (and isn't the whole reason for these reviews to provide as many points of view as possible?), I'd like to point one important thing out.  Having been associated with this year's touring company of JCS, I have come to find out that Lloyd Webber has total and absolute artistic control over ALL aspects of EVERY production, be it JCS, Cats, Phantom, etc. Every musical composition in EVERY one of his shows has his approval or it doesn't go in..in fact virtually everything you hear in these shows was penned by messers Lloyd Webber and Rice... Bottom line, if you don't like the extra songs, e-mail the guys at The Really Useful Group, they're on the web.
0156711427|5.0|This classic by E. M. Forster was written in 1924 but could have been written today, for its complexity of viewpoint on the issues of empire, race, cultural divides, and the possibility or impossibility of friendship under those conditions. I found Forster's viewpoint quite modern--there are no good guys or bad guys in this book, just human beings, some hopelessly blind to anything that doesn't fit with their world view, some bumbling along in an effort to break the stereotypes, some honest, some not. <br />Two Englishwomen arrive in India and resolve to experience it without the prejudices their compatriots exhibit. The picture Forster paints of the relationship between the English and the Indians, and how the English change once they arrive, is quite compelling. The English are masters of the subtle put-down, avoidance of eye contact, keeping staff waiting. They smile indulgently at the ladies' desire to meet real Indians and experience the country, knowing they will change quickly. A trip to the Marabar caves turns into a disaster, quite predictable, with everyone accusing Aziz, their escort, of assaulting Miss Questead. No one knows what really happened. <br />Miss Questead changes her story at trial and Aziz goes free. But no one knows how to handle this unexpected turn of events. One would think things would go back to status quo. But the trial has unearthed all the conflicting feelings the races have for each other--the English are convinced of Aziz' guilt based solely on the fact that he's Indian, the Indians are confirmed in their view that the English cannot be trusted. Miss Questead is ostracized for telling the truth, the Indians break off    their small attempts to form friendships with their occupiers. Aziz retreats from all contact with the English and irrationally suspects his only English friend of betrayal. <br />In the end both sides retreat, but ominous signs of a profound conflict to come are all around them. Knowing the history, we see that theeventual ouster of the English is inevitable--what is amazing is that Forster saw it more than 20 years before it happened.

B00005JL2O|3.0|The first two Austin Powers movies were hilarious, particularly the second one.  &quot;Goldmember,&quot; however, demonstrates that the franchise may be running out of steam.  The film is cluttered with too many characters, as if Mike Myers can't bear to leave anyone out of the party.

The new character, Goldmember, is just disgusting rather than funny.  <br />There are some great stand-out moments and surprising cameos, but the overall result is a disappointment.
B000002H4Q|3.0|Many will tell you that this is The Cure's best album, and they are right. This CD, however, is just another example of Warner Brothers' thrifty laziness. WB as a record company has always had a bad reputation and this CD is one more reason why. First, there is a track missing from the original double vinyl set. You see, when this album was first released on CD back in 1990, they could fit only 74 minutes of music on them, so they had to cut one song. But now CD's can hold up to 80 minutes of audio, yet WB refuses to remaster this album. Fifteen years has gone by since these songs were recorded, and the sound could really use a good digital clean-up. Will WB ever do it? Probably not, unless we all flood WB's website with e-mails on this very subject...
6305014140|5.0|One tradition of Japanese manga and anime is based on the legends of Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi, who was a very real swordsman serving the Tokugawa Shogunate at the beginning of the 17th century.  Jubei was known for wandering Japan, sometimes as a spy for the Shogun, and righting injustices with displays of his extraordinary swordsmanship.  Kind of a Japanese Knight of the Roundtable.<br />In 'Ninja Scroll', this part is played by Jubei Kibagami, an itinerant ninja.  He is drawn into clan politics when he comes to the aid of Kagero, a female ninja in service to the Yamashiro clan.  To save Kagero, Jubei must successfully challenge Tessai, an evil ninja (one of the Eight Devils of Kimon) with the ability to turn his skin into stone, and the strength to chop walls down.  Jubei succeeds, but Tessai swears vengeance, leaving Jubei deeply entangled in a struggle with the Shogun of the Dark.<br />The third player in this contest is Dakuan, the Shoguns spy.  He is a deadly old man who recruits Jubei by giving him a poison that will kill him in a day and a night.  Dakuan informs Jubei that Himuro Gemma, an old enemy that Jubei was sure was dead, was still alive, and, in the company of the Devils, was at the center of the plotting.  Jubei, Dakuan, and Kagero must defeat the evil ninjas and discover the purpose behind the killing of an entire village.<br />Kagero is a poison taster, and, as a result, is permeated with deadly toxins.  She can never take a lover, because even her kiss would kill.  At this point in Japanese history such a woman was an outcaste, having little value in the eyes of her society.  Jubei shatters her world when he insists on treating her as an honorable human being, creating a strong emotional tension that plays against the simple samurai action of the main plot.<br />Production qualities of the film are beautiful, echoing traditional Japanese art forms with a fine sensibility.  Line and color are strong.  Violence, of course, is present, but is tightly controlled, not dwelt upon.  This is one of the best and most representative films of the more conservative Japanese traditions of anime.  Worth seeing for its historical status as well as for its outstanding artistic values.y controlled, not dwelt upon.

078401213X|5.0|\\"Pi\\" is an outstanding and complex thriller with brains and structure.  For such a low budget film, this great movie shows you that greatness doesn't have to only come out of big budget films with well-known stars.  It is a film that gets in your head and stays with you long after it is over.<br />This dark and quiet thriller is about Maximilian Cohen, a brilliant mathematician who believes that everything in life revolves around patterns and numbers.  For years he has been trying to find this pattern that could unlock everything we see and know.  He starts with the stock market, the ultimate system of ordered chaos.  The deeper he digs, the more insane he becomes.  And the more he finds out, the more danger he is thrown into.  The pattern itself proves to be just as deadly as the people who are after him.  The twists and complexity will leave you in awe.<br />While this movie may be confusing at times, it still does its job and keeps us intrigued throughout the duration of the film.  The acting and writing is really remarkable.  Sean Gullette is very convincing as Max.  I don't think there is anybody else who could've gotten the job done.  Everybody else was also great in it as well.  The film is also a debut from Darren Aronofsky; and a powerful one at that.  Very well written and directed.  Some of the camera techniques are really great and allow you to get inside of the main character's head.<br />The DVD is great as well.  The picture quality is really good, considering it is a black and white film.  (The black and white actually enriches the film more.  It would've been less effective in color.)  The sound is really great too.  Some of the extras are 2 commentary tracks, a behind the scenes montage, lost scenes, trailers, a music video, and more.  Very satisfactory.<br />\\"Pi\\" is a movie that requires you to think throughout the film and after.  It's a film that will mostly appeal to those who like quiet and unique thrillers.

0380778556|5.0|Younger readers, I fear, are sadly unaware of Daphne Du Maurier's place in the book world.  She was quite the significant and prolific author, and set the standard for the \\"gothic\\" romance with REBECCA. She was one of the bestselling authors of her time.  Remember, this is the woman who also wrote THE BIRDS, another Hitchcock classic, as well as several other works that were made into films, including JAMAICA INN, THE SCAPEGOAT (with Alec Guinness), and DON'T LOOK NOW (with Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie).  Unfortunately, I only see a handful of her many novels listed here on Amazon.<br />REBECCA is one of the few, if not the only, of the many gothic romance novels of that era that survived as a \\"classic\\".  The reason is the unique approach to the tale, the nameless new bride living in the shadow of her husband's first wife.  And then there's the twisty ending, a reading moment that you'll never forget.<br />Not all of her novels are gothic or even romance-- The Scapegoat is a great tale of two men swapping identities, Don't Look Now is a tale of true horror set in Venice, and one of my favorites, The Parasites, is a departure from romance, mystery, or horror, exploring the strange bonds between a trio of siblings.  Her books may have SOLD in the 30's & 40's like Danielle Steel's do now, but you won't find that they are the same book over and over with different names!<br />Du Maurier's work should and must endure -- buy what you can new, scan used book stores and garage sales for the rest of her treasures!<br />If you find yourself loving her books, then also look for her autobiography, called MYSELF WHEN YOUNG.
B00003CXCW|5.0|I would dare to say SUNSET BLVD. is one of the ten most legendary American films of the 20th century and unlike it's tiresome overrated 1950 rival ALL ABOUT EVE (which outrageously stole the year's Best Picture Academy Award) it is a legend that seems to grow every year.  This film is flawless and can be joyed on many levels, as a gothic chiller, perverse and/or tragic romance, lavish film noir, or black comedy. This is Billy Wilder's finest hour on film despite such other achievements as DOUBLE IDEMNITY and SOME LIKE IT HOT. William Holden is outstanding as the failing screenwriter who falls into the role of gigolo but Gloria Swanson gives a stunning performance like no other film turn you have ever seen.  Chewing the scenery and never once seeming false or  unbelievable, Swanson's Norma Desmond is second only to Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara as the American film's most unforgettable screen heroine.  And it still works after half a century.  Norma Desmond is STILL BIG, it's the screen that's gotten smaller!
0321127420|5.0|I first became acquainted with the works of Martin Fowler back in 1999, when I read Analysis Patterns.  It was a fantastic book. I then read Refactoring, UML Distilled and when I saw 2 months ago that he had written a book on J2EE Architecture, I couldn't wait for the release.  I just received my copy the other day and I wasn't disappointed.  I picked it up and started reading.  I wish that I had had this book about 2 years when I began writing Servlets, JSPs and EJBs.  It would have saved me a lot of headaches and failures and learning the hard way.  He writes in a very clear, concise manner that is easily understandable.  He also provides a lot of code samples.  I have one problem with Martin Fowler though, I want him to write more books.
0140149295|5.0|Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter's \\"The 16th Round\\" made my weekend delightful. It is one book that calls morality to question. The story it tells is just one out of the millions most Black Americans of his era (and beyond) developed immunity to hearing. It is a sweet sad story; and every page of the book seem to ask: Where has justice gone? I couldn't give an answer, but I know one thing for sure: Freedom was faraway, and compassion was nowhere to be found.<BR>Yes, like every other society, there are two people in the U.S.A.: the good ones and the bad ones. Given the nation's racially charged history, I can understand the reason why \\"freedom and justice\\" are among the most common phrases that feature in every Presidential Speech. History clearly shows that the United States of America deliberately deprived herself of both true freedom and true justice. The reason for this being that the country showed more interest in the skin-colour of her denizens than in the contents of their character.<BR>Permit me to add this: I have always been a vocal supporter of Capital Punishment: as a deterrent for heinous crimes. But, the fact that justice has been, and are still being perverted on a daily basis (has since) doused my support for Death Penalty. My conscience never tires to remind me that many unfortunate 'Rubin Carters' have been put to death solely because of their skin-colour, and never because they actually did what they were accused of doing. These unfortunate souls were never champions. They were never celebrated. Their transitions went unheralded, but God kept the count. The human heart is desperately wicked! We have soiled our hands, and have polluted our lands with innocent blood. Our wickedness is worse than stench!<BR>Well, there is no point crying over spilled milk. The most reasonable thing for us to do now is to change. We have to seek true penance, true repentance, before seeking the forgiveness of God. We owe these to God, and to all our victims. I have always known that the more unfortunate 'Rubin Carters' lie in unmarked graves. Their \\"16th Rounds\\" may never be written.
B00005JM09|1.0|At first I was very excited to hear about a new Terminator film, Silly me thinking that just as they had in the last film they would bring back the proper cast. Now I love Eddie Furlong, but I can't kid myself into thinking he is exactly essential to the film, though it would be a major plus for him to be in it. James Cameron and Linda Hamilton however are a big part of The Terminator legacy, to take a way them, well that alone could destroy the movie. <br />Yet it gets worse, at first I was shock and excited to her Michael Biehn was returning, after all if we can't have John's mother in this movie why not his father, but them i thought about it. Wait, we know through previous films that Sarah dies after the war starts; we also know that Kyle is born after the war starts as well. One would know that Kyle is born sometime at 1997 when the war starts, perhaps around the year 2000. John is technically about 16-20 years older then his father. So how could Kyle still played by Biehn return as the father of Nick Stahl, who's playing John in this chapter. Even if Biehn hadn't age a day since the first Terminator, he would still be too old to be John's father. There is no way to send him back in time again, because he died. Perhaps they are extremely creative, but I truly see no way to logically have Kyle fit in this movie.<br />But, Hey I could be wrong and this movie might blow me away, so maybe I'll be writing a new review when it comes out, but will the info available now this movie seems pretty sad.
B000003TA4|5.0|green day wouldn't have even made it past playing gigs in public restrooms, basements and livingrooms if it wasn't for nirvana.  kurt cobain might've been self-loathing, but at least he had the capacity to be have empathy, and he sure as heck had a little dignity left in him before april of '94.  he treated his fans who loved his music very well, and sadly i can't say the same for billy who apparently thinks it's ok to be apathetic and destroy towards OTHER people's property.  nirvana made rock popular again.  if nirvana had never made it big green day wouldn't have taken their place.  without nirvana, there would not have been the 'mini-music-revolution' in the early 90's.  prove it to yourself and buy nevermind.  fast shipping from the amazon... who could ask for more.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is great.  I bought it for my 7-year-old daughter, but I love it.  Plus, it has extra activities on the second disc for kids to have fun with.  This movie is funny, action packed, and it's great for all kids, even adults who are kids at heart.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Stylish, classy, sexy in a demure manner, and definately confident! Something always comes along to break the trends of mainstream monotony. Norah Jones made this come true. Her music combines perfect elements of classic lounge jazz with  a modern twist of pop and R&B. Sounds a bit strange maybe, but Norah Jones elegently opens her soul to seep into her music. I can't put my finger on exactly what I love about this intangible flowing creativity. , but just to sit and FEEL the music is enough. I'm not an extreme jazz style buff so I wouldn't know an exceptional amount concerning the technicality of this music, but I don't need to to be an ardent fan. Soulful music pours from her eyes, voice, and fingertips; the music bussiness revealing a true afficianado of an artist. I highly reccomend this album for any light-hearted soul listeners. I look forward to more imaginative, and simple (yet so elaborate in feeling)work from her in the future. 5 stars and a smile!

6304082428|5.0|Of all the dramatisations of classic novels of British literature that I have seen, none have so completely captured a novel's essence or been so perfectly cast as has this rendition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  It is simply outstanding--a beautiful treatment of a splendidly witty, humorous and insightful novel.<br />For those unfamiliar with the novel, it is certainly not necessary to read it in order to fully appreciate the dramatisation (although it is a novel that I highly recommend).  Briefly, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man.  Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters).  Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and \\"first impressions\\"), however, does not care for the arrogant, haughty Mr. Darcy, whose real fault lies in letting his pride show.  It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark.  I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away for those unfamiliar with it.  Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for although customs have changed and technologies have advanced, human nature remains the same.<br />For those familiar with the novel, liberties have necessarily been taken in bringing the novel to screen in order to create an interesting and enjoyable visual experience, but they are not intrusive, obvious liberties (ie. one must root through the novel in order to find them), and the story remains admirably close to the original.  Most important of all, it is absolutely spot on in capturing the essence and themes of the novel (which, I might add is no mean feat!).    <br />As for the cast, they are all absolutely superb at capturing the essence of their respective characters--from Julia Sawalha's giddy and vivacious portrayal of the boy-crazy and impetuous Lydia Bennet (Elizabeth's younger sister) to David Bamber's hilarious portrayal of the grovelling, sycophantic toady Mr. Collins (Elizabeth's cousin upon whom the family's house is entailed) to Alison Steadman's humourously shrill and highly strung Mrs. Bennet (Elizabeth's eternally pessimistic mother).  Of course, one simply cannot forget the splendid portrayal by Jennifer Ehle, who captures Lizzy's spirit and wit to perfection.  Last but certainly not least is Colin Firth, who will forever be etched in many a mind (and heart) as the quintessential Mr. Darcy.<br />In conclusion, this is a story of timeless appeal which I highly, highly recommend.  Although it will certainly be of interest to fans of period drama (for it is without a doubt one of the best of all time), I believe its scope is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for a great story that's superbly acted.  This is truly a beautiful, classic story that the whole family can enjoy.  It really is a dramatisation that comes along once in a lifetime and one to be treasured.  It is a joy to curl up and watch it time and time again, and I simply cannot praise it highly enough.<br />For those who have enjoyed the dramatisation, I highly recommend the superb companion book entitled \\"The Making of Pride and Prejudice.\\"

0375703764|5.0|This novel is the beginning of a change in literature.  Welcome to the computer age where a novel's orginality isn't based on what it's about but the format it's presented in.  This book gets inside your head, and even if you're not afraid while you're reading it you will be.  It touches a fear that everyone has inside of them and brings it to the surface and makes them face it.  The fear of being out of control, the fear of the dark, claustrophobia, ect.  Whatever petty things scare you this will amplify it.  Let yourself fall into this book.  Anyone who gives this novel less than five stars is retarded or didn't understand it.<br />-jb
B000002KLZ|5.0|This is Fleetwood Mac.  This is the raw energy captured back when they were in their prime.  The Dance is pretty, but it lacks sincerity, emotion and energy.

B00005KJ1G|4.0|The only other Manowar album I own is Kings Of Metal, which I got before this one. I have to say that at first I was disappointed with this album. Kings Of Metal was faster and more refined, resembling power metal. The music here is significantly slower, resembling a cross between AC/DC and early Iron Maiden. Getting used to the sound was what was needed. However, I have now totally fallen for this album. Strong guitar and bass work, fantastic vocal delivery and quite simply memorable songs are what make this so good.<br />I now consider Eric Adams to be one of the finest vocalists I've ever heard. He was great on Kings Of Metal and he is great here. He has a fantastic range, a powerful delivery and a fierce passion. Joey DeMaio is also one of the finest bass players in metal, alongside Steve Harris, John Myung and Cliff Burton. His style and sound fits the music perfectly and he doesn't merely follow the guitar (listen to the sound of that bass at the beginning of Fast Taker). Not to mention guitarist Ross Friedman, AKA Ross The Boss. He not only has a good technical skill, but his solos also compliment the songs brilliantly. He has a very bluesy style that is not normally associated with hard rock/metal.<br />Further, the lyrics here are better than those on Kings Of Metal, dealing with Vietnam veterans rather than motorbikes, sex slaves and wars in the name of metal. Not to mention that this is on the whole less cheesy. Yes, it does sound dated and no, this isn't for every rock/metal fan (especially if you prefer power metal to traditional 80s heavy metal), but on the whole this is a strong debut.
B00005ALNI|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was a teenager.  I thought it was a great film with an absolutely fantastic soundtrack.  In fact, the soundtrack is so great that I ran out and bought it as soon as it hit the stores.  But very few movies get even better with age!  The Big Chill is one such movie.  <BR>The story begins with a group of college friends reuniting to attend the funeral of one of their group who has committed suicide.  We never get to meet Alex (a part played by Kevin Costner that ended up on the cutting room floor), but we learn about him through his friends as they try to make sense of his death and their lives.  Each of them have secret yearnings that come to the forefront after this tragedy.  Alex's suicide causes each member of the group to examine their lives more closely.  Sam Weber is an actor, Who despite the fame and fortune still longs for the girl and the life he left behind.  Sarah and Harold Cooper, a happily married couple, struggling to deal with the fact that Alex committed suicide in their home, wondering what they could have done to prevent Alex's downward spiral.  Meg Jameson is a lawyer, who has begun to realize that she has put her career over everything else in her life.  Michael Goldman is a reporter for People Magazine, who begins to realize that what he has become is not even close to what he always wanted to be.  Karen Bowens is a housewife who got everything she thought she was supposed to want out of life, now realizing that she never truly wanted any of it.  Nick Williams is a cynical, unhappy man who wanders through life seeking to try every experience out there.  What he and his friends begin to realize is how closely Nick's life has begun to parallel that of Alex.<BR>The cast of this film features such greats as Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, William Hurt, and Jeff Goldblum, to name a few.  The storyline is strong, and one that we can relate to.  Who doesn't wonder if their lives have gone in different directions than we originally intended?  Who doesn't see the irony in choices we have made throughout our lives?  The camaraderie among the friends in this group is believeable and allows us to reminisce about the friends we had in high school and college.  The script is full of lines you just love to quote, such as what Michael says about wakes: \\"Amazing tradition. They throw a great party for you on the one day they know you can't come.\\"  You find yourself laughing and crying along with the characters.  And the soundtrack - Tracks of My Tears, Ain't Too Proud To Beg, Whiter Shade of Pale, to name a few - will have you singing along with the movie!  All in all, I have to say that I appreciated this movie as a teenager, but I appreciate it more now as an adult.
B00001OH7T|2.0|Although its better than most of the stuff today its Bowie's worst effort out of his best period.  I own everything from Space Oddity to Scary Monsters except Young Americans.

0066214122|2.0|Once again, Michael Crichton demonstrates his talent for squeezing the most amount of words into the least amount of sense. This really is little more than another &quot;Body Snatchers&quot; tale, interspersed with Luddite warnings of the imminent dangers of technology, which are in turn brought to life with the kind of plodding descriptions that show you that the only thing he actually understood properly was the use of copy and paste in his word processor. Kind of embarrassing at times, even. He's got scenes about from inside an ER that show such astonishing ignorance of a field he really was never in. A painful read in those places, particularly. But then, a lot of his stuff is. If you know anything at all about the subjects of his books, you almost always seem to understand them better than he does.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Everything that David Bowie did from Space Oddity to Scary Monsters,  with the exception of Young Americans, was pure unadulterated genius.  It is hard to pick a favorite or say which one is the best.  But along with Heroes, The Rise and Fall, and Space Oddity,    Station  to Station could be considered one of the greatest rock albums ever made. period. I mean what else is their to say. I 'm not even going to.  Just buy it(or any of the ones I mentioned) and thank me later.
B00006LLNU|3.0|I must admit I was expecting a lot from this album. Sigur Ros and their masterpiece Agaetis Byrjun set the parameters for any upcoming album from the band. In their website, the band admitted to have produced a raw and not so much produced album, and hence that is the reality. I believe that this cd follows pretty much the same line all along, going from two top notch tracks like the first and the second (being track 1 my favorite - I shouldn't forget the nothing Song) and then after maintaining the same characteristics all along, which are some relaxing tunes that sometimes seem to lack their own life. Though, I loved the programming and games Jonsi played with his voice on the first song. Nothing Song also introduces amazing choruses different from the live version we used to know, but the overall feel is that this album lacks the first cd's main characteristics, which are life of its own in every track. Difference in between them. I think this one suffers from too much similarity all along. Still, Sigur Ros is one of my favorite bands.
0066214122|3.0|The unique appeal of Michael Chriton's fiction has always lain in the immediate relevance of its science.  Chrichton gives us an exciting, cautionary mini-lesson in theory while propelling us nose-first into tantalizing, blockbuster adventure.  His latest novel, Prey, is no exception.  We have attractive young geniuses (when is a Chrichton heroine ever plain and dull?) battling a science project gone horribly awry, and as the story evolves we better understand just why Xytech Labs' product is so dangerous.  The microscopic villians arise from, as Chriton puts it, &quot;the meeting point of nanotechnology, biotechnology, and computer technology.&quot;  All three have the ability to release self-replicating entities into the environment, he reminds us, and it shall be left at that.<br />The prose works best when it follows the narrator's mind through all the little revelations that crop up.  My favorite of these isn't even relevant to the story.  Dropping the children off at school one morning, out-of-work computer programmer Jack Forman notices their burdensome loads and thinks to himself, &quot;Some of the kids had their packs on rollers, hauling them like luggage at the aiport...The world was becoming digital; everything was smaller and lighter.  But kids at school lugged more weight than ever.&quot;  Don't get me wrong, this book is about predator-prey chases, explosions, and the dangers of tainted science.  Jack usually has far too much excitement on his hands to afford reflection, and it may be just as well since action and suspense are what keep the pages burning off this volume like kindling.<br />Unfortunately, Chrichton's intelligent thrill machine grows stiff in the joints toward the end.  The players sometimes react in a surprisingly jaded manner, like when certain minor characters meet their untimely demise.  Still, there's nothing worse than making a literary fuss over something that should be enjoyed as pure entertainment--even when laced with contemporary caution.
B000002HAF|5.0|Despite what other people may think, this band is as listenable now as they ever were.  It is bands that break the molds that always become great, and The Pixies broke all standards that were set in the decade of big hair and synthesizers.  Grunge rock changed music in the early 90's, and this band inspired the grundge movement.  As far as people's complaints to the lyrics, they should know that Black Francis never made a song to communicate a message really.  He sang random syllables while he was writing the music and they eventually molded themselves into words.  This album was their best. Although Doolittle came close, it lacks the depth and shock value of Surfer Rosa.  Even bands today cover these songs live, and a fairly recent tribute album attracted all the big names of many genres.  If you are a true music lover, you will find no trouble enjoying this album.  It's the ones who only claim they appreciate good music who find it difficult.
0316666343|4.0|Having lost a loved one a few years ago, this book gave me such a comfort.  With the main character in heaven, looking down on her family, made the book easy to relate to.  It makes you think about life after death and the hardships that have to be overcome to be able to move on.<BR>The author does a good job of narrating this story from the, shall we say, angel's point of view.  It is detached in a way that allows the reader to feel their own emotion, but attached in such a way that prohibits the reader from having their own feeling.  You want to sympathize, celebrate, and rejoice with the characters as their lives progress.<BR>A great Saturday afternoon book!
B00005JL96|5.0|Ok let's face it. Disney cartoons as of late have totally lost the heart and appeal that they once had. Other than the Pixar movies, which don't lack heart or appeal at all Disney hasn't really made a good cartoon since the early 90's! It's sad that as of late Disney has been aiming their cartoons towards a more grown up audience and has featured more grown up looking animation that basically is the only thing good about them. Movies like Snow White, Jungle Book, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, Robin Hood, Bambi are all legendary films that rank up there with movies with real actors/actreses in them and have more heart and appeal than some of those movies. The late 80's saw Disney cartoon come out of a slump with the mega hit, The Little Mermaid. It seemed that basically everything that would follow in the next few years would also be a hit, and they were. Beauty and The Beast, The Lion King and Aladdin all had the feel of the old Disney cartoons. They were going to be those classics for the next generations of familes to enjoy. Sadly after those films it seemed like Disney truly ran out of ideas. The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Pochahauntus, and Moulin were all bombs and were the begingings of Disney's downfall. All of those films seemed to be not totally directed for a child audience and for the first time since The Black Calduron (which happens to be one of my fave. Disney films and the most darkest)a cartoon carried a PG rating which was the given to the huge bomb, Moulin. The somewhat savior of Disney would come with the creation of Pixar. Toy Story was a huge hit, which Disney so badly needed. The sequel went onto to become a huge hit as well. When Pixar created A Bug's Life they had competition with a rip off movie called ANTZ. ANTZ went onto bomb and Pixar was still the champ that was until a little movie called Shrek came out and Disney was left baffeled. Not to be outdone Disney fired back with Monster's Inc. which had just as much impact as Toy Story did but sadly it didn't do as well as Shrek but did better than Shrek's follow up, Ice Age (which is pretty good I might add). Two summer's ago Disney took a huge risk with Atlantis. Atlantis looked like no other Disney cartoon and got the PG rating. Disney's risk failed and once again has failed with the newly released, Treasure Planet. Inbetween those releases though the savior of Disney cartoons was release. Lilo and Stitch has the feel of a old beloved Disney classic with a bit of the Pixar films humor. Sadly the movie didn't do as well as expected even with the cutest Disney character, Stitch and to many was another failed attempt to regain old glory but to me it wasn't. This is by far in my opinion the best Disney film of all time. Anytime a film brings tears to my eyes (and i'm a 24 year old guy)there is something special about it. This reminded me in many way of a cartoon version of E.T. or A.I., both of which brought tears to my eyes and in my opinion are two of the best films in movie history. Lilo and Stitch is like nothing else Disney has done before but it still has that classic feel. I saw that someone said they liked this film but wished that they were a little kid. When I was watching this film I did feel like a little kid again and that's something that Disney only does with Pixar films nowadays to me. If you're scared away for some reason to the recent Disney movies for whatever reason please don't miss this film. This film is just as important to the Disney legacy as Snow White, The Little Mermaid and, Beauty And The Beast The Lion King are. It may have not done well in the theater (only the Pixar films do these days)but i'm willing to bet that when you rent or buy this film you will regret not seeing this film in the theater because it's one of those movies you'll remember. I was lucky enough to see E.T. snd Return Of The Jedi in the theater back in the early 80's and both are two of my fave. movies of all time (i've collected Star Wars merch ever since I was little). I'm thankful for seeing those back then but sadly missed out on Lilo and Stitch in the theater and feel that if I did go to see it theatrically that it would give me the same memories like E.T. and Jedi did over some 20 years ago.as little).

B00003CXZ4|4.0|&quot;Memento&quot; is one of those relentlessly brainy thrillers that actually require you to think. And it does something else that you don't usually see in a movie: at the beginning of the film, we share our hero's sense of confusion and helplessness. Not only do we not understand what's going on, we're not even sure how to figure it out. Then gradually, we begin to piece together the story, something our hero cannot do. By the end of the movie, we transcend his state of helpless confusion and return to our role as spectators, accompanied by the full realization of just how awful his situation is because we've been there. Unlike him, however, we can return to our linear, cohesive world, while he is trapped in a kind of forever now.<br />It may not be a great film, but it's certainly an intruiging one.
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosby's single of &quot;White Christmas&quot; sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and was the best-selling single in any music category for more than 50 years until 1998 when Elton John's tribute to Princess Diana, &quot;Candle in the Wind,&quot; overtook it in a matter of months. However, this does not take into account all those millions of copies of the song that were sold as part of albums such as this 1949 classical collection of Christmas songs from der Bingle.  The song was written by Irving Berlin for the Bing Crosby-Fred Astaire film &quot;Holiday Inn,&quot; and was first performed by Crosby on his Christmas Day radio show in 1941.  Crosby recorded the single in May 1941, &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; came out in August, and on Halloween the song hit #1 and stayed there for 11 weeks.  However, the version on this Christmas album was, I believe, recorded in 1947 when Crosby had to return to the studio because the original master had been damaged because of so much use (&quot;White Christmas&quot; made it back into the Top 30 sixteen times, hitting #1 again in both 1945 and 1947).<br />Of course, there are eleven other songs on this album once you get past the title song, which is, surprisingly, the second track on the album.  The other songs cover the entire musical spectrum in terms of Christmas songs.  There is &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town&quot; for the kids and &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; for the parents.  There are religious songs like &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;Adeste Fideles,&quot; and secular classics including &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and &quot;Silver Bells.&quot;  Crosby even goes ethnic with &quot;Christmas in Killarney&quot; and &quot;Mele Kalikimaka.&quot;  All of them reflect Crosby's crooning at his best, at a time when his vocal maturity matched his reputation as the premier vocalist of his day.  This has been one of the premier Christmas collections for over half-a-century, with good reason.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Between the storyline and the hip-hop video by Dr. Evil, I loved this movie and couldn't wait to own it!<br />It steals ideas from the good Bond movies (anything before Die Another Day and excluding Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again).  I especially enjoyed reliving Bond running across crocodiles as Powers runs across several Japanese Sumo wrestlers in a bath.<br />If you enjoy comedy and Bond movies, this is a must own. After watching this one several times, do yourself a favor and order the first two Austin Powers movies ...
6305079811|4.0|Every movie produced tries to be fun and entertaining, but few accomplish it as well as this movie version of Flash Gordon from 1980.  Max von Sydow, Sam Jones, and Ornella Muti are great in their roles as Ming the Merciless, Flash, and Ming's debauched daughter, Aurora.  Timothy Dalton was in this too, as well as the guy from sliders to play the chief Hawkman, and maybe Topol as Dr. Hanz Zarkov.<br /><br />This movie is almost two hours of brainless fun.  It's also matched up with an outstanding Queen soundtrack.  This is a great guilty pleasure for any movie fan.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins

B0000636UN|3.0|As much as I like Sheryl's music, C'mon C'mon is an artistic disappointment. It's hard to believe the same woman who wrote Home or Riverwide has also written Soak up the sun or You're an original. The four years passed since the release of The Globe Sessions seems to have had a negative effect on Crow's creativity. Her new cd only has a few presentable songs and the rest is filler material when not awful.<br />Let's see. In my opinion, the good songs are Steve McQueen, Safe and sound, the title track, It's only love, Abilene, Weather channel and Missing, that's actually *missing* on the US edition. I'm sorry for you guys. Some of the other tracks are listenable (It's so easy, Over you, Lucky kid or Diamond road) but Soak up the sun, You're an original and Hole in my pocket and simply embarrassing to sit through.<br />Looks like Sheryl has chosen to take the easy way and put out an album which shows her at her catchiest. Sure as hell C'mon C'mon is better than most other females releases, but nevertheless is a very poor follow up to that jewel called The Globe Sessions.<br />I hope she gets back on track next time. I'm not sure if her record company's pressures may have had something to do with her sudden stylistic departure. I honestly hope so. Her new outlook is not too encouraging, either. I mean did we need to see her on swimming suit (Not that there's anything wrong with that). On Steve McQueen she quotes \\"All our popstars look like porn\\", yet she has appeared half-naked in that lousy magazine called Stuff. Another bump to her credentials as a serious female rocker is her recent willingness to let her songs be used on commercials. <br />In a nutshell: don't get this album if you are new to Sheryl Crow's music.

B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is one of the best bands ever, and they proove it with this CD.  I have been a Tool fan for years and this album continues the saga.  It has everything from calm songs like Parabol and Reflection/Disposition to heavey songs like The Grudge and Ticks and Leeches.  This is a must have to any rock colection!!
0684801558|4.0|As the star of his own life and F. Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, Anthony Patch is what the protagonist of Fitzgerald's debut \\"This Side of Paradise\\" would have become had he been allowed to grow up without the wizening experiences Amory Blaine suffers.  But, though older and richer than Amory, Anthony truly suffers more; in fact, following his alcoholic downward spiral creates a great deal of suffering in the reader, even as the prose is lovely and the characterizations full.  At least Anthony (and the reader) has the stunning Gloria Gilbert to accompany him on that cirrhotic journey.<br />Anthony and Gloria would have fit right in among the Bright Young Things of Fitzgerald's English contemporary Evelyn Waugh's more satirical, far less meaty novels of callous behavior and insincere rich people.  Fitzgerald's characters are sincere, however--sincere about expecting that the world should fall at their feet forever, and that earning their way by honest toil isn't the way to go about it.  This book is a tale of a destructive marriage in which neither party is more at fault than the other, and in which the greatest sin of both is narcissism (though despair is often not far off as the story moves along).<br />You've got to hand it to Gloria, though: feminists and individualists of all stripes and sexes will appreciate her paean to self-actualization:<br />\\"What grubworms women are to crawl on their bellies through colorless marriages!  Marriage was created not to be a background but to need one.  Mine is going to be outstanding.  It can't, shan't be the setting--it's going to be the performance, the live, lovely glamorous performance, and the world shall be the scenery.  I refuse to dedicate my life to posterity.\\"<br />Wouldn't it be fun to listen to this woman tell stories if she lived to be 80?<br />For all its beauty, \\"The Beautiful and Damned\\" can wear the reader down.  It's too long, for one thing, and Anthony and Gloria keep repeating the same mistakes long after Fitzgerald has established that they are the kind of people who don't learn from their mistakes.  Fitzgerald fans should definitely give it a try, and if it wears on you by the middle of the book then you should feel no guilt about letting it sit for a while.  I should also add that the first seven pages are as enticing an opening as any I've read in an American novel.  Every era needs its portraits in fiction, and the 1920s belong to Fitzgerald.
B00006YXEK|5.0|In no way can I complain about anything in this super package! The CD is a marvelous collection of tunes that stand tall among all Harrisongs. I love each of the CD's offerings, but among my favorites are \\"Any Road,\\" \\"Looking For My Life,\\" \\"Rising Sun,\\" \\"Run So Far,\\" \\"The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,\\" and \\"Brainwashed.\\" Perhaps my very favorite of all is \\"Pisces Fish.\\" I defy anyone to listen to that song and not hum the chorus for hours afterward! George's music has intrigued and satisfied me for nearly forty years, and this CD continues that tradition. I love it so much I even bought the non-package CD for use in my car! <br />As to the included DVD, yes, it's short, and yes, I'd have loved hours of George, Dhani, and Jeff Lynne on video. However, I'm grateful that the package included as much video as it did. I'll happily take seven minutes over none any day! The video is a moving, comforting, and satisfying tribute to a special man--and probably seven minutes is more than George would have tolerated about himself anyway!<br />As to the rest of the package, the poster/photo of George, roughly 14 X 20 inches, is something I cherish. I am thrilled to have the Dark Horse sticker, too. And the guitar pick? Major cool! Shucks, I even love the sublime black box.<br />As I said, I have no complaints about the contents of this package. They're both a grand memory of George Harrison, and a super gift to his fans as well. It's a package that will keep memories of the Pisces Fish himself running through our souls for years to come.
B00006LJ72|2.0|This is the 2nd time that Warner Music has released a collection of Enya, first being Box of Dreams and now this.<br />Note that there are truly only few tracks here that were never released under her standard albumn releases: Sun in your stream, Isobella, Song of the sandman, Willows on the water, First of autumn and May it be.<br />There are other Side B tracks that have been omitted, making it a very incomplete collection. If you have collected most of her albums including singles, you probably already have most of these tracks, so give this a miss. Otherwise, by all means get this great collection if you are totally new to her music.
B00004XPP0|5.0|I've been a fan of Star Wars longer than I know. Although I wasn't around when the movies were originally released, I watched the movies when they were re-released for the 20th anniversary, and I've been hooked ever since. Not only are the movies great in entertainment value, but they are a true reflection upon life. Good versus evil is the overriding theme, and as Lucas wrote in the introduction to the hardback books of the movies, it's about the choices we make, that we all are intrinsically capable of doing anything. Many are critical of the acting in the movies (especially the new ones), the dialogue, and the overuse of the special effects. Frankly, I don't believe the acting is all that bad-it isn't going to win an Academy Award, but it fits in with the time, the place, the message...<br />A New Hope-Honestly, I like this one the least. I think that Luke was very immature (although it fits his personality at the time), and the complete incompetence of the guards on the Death Star is quite laughable. Nevertheless, Alec Guiness is great as the brooding Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Harrison Ford's performance as Han Solo is outstanding.<br />The Empire Strikes Back-Almost as good as ROTJ. The movie seems to drag at points, as it becomes mired in the mystical teachings of Yoda, and the seemingly slow pursuit of the Millennium Falcon in the asteroid field. Even so, it develops Yoda as the beloved character he is today. The Cloud City duel is epic, as Luke does battle with Darth Vader...Also, Han and Leia reveal their attraction for one another. People deride the romance in AOTC for springing out of nowhere, but is the romance in TESB much better or any less 'spontaneous'? I think not.<br />Return of the Jedi-The best in the series. Luke matures greatly, and his loneliness continues to grow as Yoda dies, as does his father, Anakin. (This is why I don't like the New Republic books as much; I think he shows much more compassion and sociality than the end of ROTJ shows.) Darth Vader's funeral pyre is an especially poignant scene; one can almost feel Luke's pain, as John Williams' score resonates. The dancing on Endor is cheesy, but I like the ephemeral images of Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda. It is the end of the past, and a time for a new beginning.<br />I will get the original trilogy when it comes out on DVD (which probably won't be until Episode III is finished). I hope they have interviews with the original cast members. It is amazing that the spring of 2005 will bring forth the last Star Wars movie...the books are great, but the way Lucas has brought this galaxy 'far, far away' on the screen can never be replicated.
B00007E8V4|4.0|In the absence of Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down is settling into the still-warm \\"Mainstream Political Band\\" seat.  Songs like \\"Boom!\\", \\"NuGuns\\", \\"A.D.D. (American Dream Disorder)\\", and \\"F**k The System\\" fill the album with burning questions about the rationale of the American political stance, while \\"Inner Vision\\", \\"Mr. Jack\\", and, my favorite, \\"Roulette\\" fill out the album with texture and depth to spare for three albums.  Serj and Daron's vocals are a force to be reckoned with, whether they are screaming at the top of their lungs or wailing melodically.  Pack that together with powerful bass riffs, the typical but occasionally playful metal guitarist, and hard hitting rhythm, and you have one heck of an album.  Not the greatest rock album out there, but \\"Steal This Album\\" is definitely solid.
B00005JLWL|5.0|Although the story is not very original (looks like 1984 & Matrix), I like it very much. It is one of the best action movies in this year. In particular, they successfully blending gun shoting and martial arts together into one, you will see what I mean when you see the last fight scene.
0066214122|5.0|&quot;Prey&quot; is a very interesting thriller in usual complicated Crichton format. It takes more than one read to really get into the story. Often, his books grow on the reader and society and years later his works are accepted by the general public. Sure, in &quot;Prey&quot; Crichton is experimental, but he's always been that way--taking risks and exploring the unusual; and this is exactly what makes good storytelling and great authors. I think PREY is a great read. I also very much recommended the very interesting powerful thriller by Alec Donzi: THE CONSULTANT.

0743455967|5.0|Although I still have not read any of Stephen King's wildly popular horror fiction, I was prepared to like this book. I was prepared by a preface King wrote to a story anthology by science fiction writer Harlan Ellison. In the essay King compares one writer reading another's work to refrigerated milk in an open carton at risk of picking up other flavors.  On Writing is an excellent, readable, and revealing primer of the life of a modern writer, a kind of Horatio Alger story devoid of both pomposity and false modesty.  Although the book is devoted as much or more to King's life's than it is to writing, the two subjects are mutually illuminating. The actual advice he gives about writing is also, when he gets to it, most instructive. It can be summarized by the phrase: Omit Needless Words. King emphasizes editing, demonstrates the economy of eliminating adverbs, and looks objectively at his own and others' work. The result is refreshing honesty and practical advice. My favorite line is about the virtual necessity of destroying a book's \\"best parts\\"-fetishized passages beloved by the author-for the sake of the novel as a whole. Because these favorite parts often act like blood clots or traffic blocking narrative flow, they must be gotten rid of. Although not his own, the phrase is fittingly macabre for a work scribed by King: \\"Kill your darlings.\\"
B00007E8V4|5.0|First of all any CD that System Of A Down comes out with is gonna be awesome, but this is crazy. They always have had kinda weird lyrics and explosive music, but this time i think they took it a step up on the instesity and creativity level. I just wish all bands would do that.<br />     My favortes on this album in no order,<BR>*Ego Brain- It start out slow with acustic,It hads a nice flow to it.<BR>*Roulette- Another slow one, again with acustic. It is probably my favorite song by System Of A Down.<br />*Chic 'N' Stew- This song is deffinatly a prime example of there odd style of lyrics. Its about a pepperoni pizza. You can't help but giggle when listening to it.<br />      Everyone, Get this Album!!!
6303012140|4.0|This is an enormously entertaining film that is slyly intelligent,  chock full of action, and quite humorous. The time is the future, 2032 AD. The location is California, and the police just ain't what they used to be, as the future is a sanitized, politically correct world, where only the most benign  behavior is the standard by which all live. Even bad language is a no no.  The police of the future have nothing in common with the police of the past. Guns are outlawed, as is all physical violence. Los Angeles is no more, having merged with San Diego into a new entity known as San Angeles, which is ruled by the architect of the new society, Dr. Raymond Cocteau, who is played with sage aplomb by the late Nigel Hawthorne. He is not, however, all that he seems.    This is, indeed, a \\"brave new world\\" and Lenina Huxley, played with delicious comic abandon by Sandra Bullock, is a police woman who waxes nostalgic for the past. The LAPD is now the SAPD. Her colleague, Alfredo Garcia, played with Eagle Scout earnestness by Benjamin Bratt, epitomizes the new order of things. He is a Dudley-do-right without the wherewithal to set right what is soon to go wrong. His is a future where everyone's whereabouts are known to the police, as all are tagged with a device that allows the police monitor their whereabouts. His is a future where all obey instantly, and civility is the standard of the day. His is a future where all address each other by their full names. His is a future where meat is no longer a food item, the use of salt is illegal, and corporate franchise wars have left Taco Bell to reign supreme as THE restaurant of the time. His is a future where sex is a non-contact activity.     The violent past intrudes on this sanitized future in the persona of Simon Phoenix, played with over-the-top abandon by a blond Wesley Snipes, who, like a phoenix arising out of the ashes, is freed from his cryogenic prison and unleashed upon an unprepared SAPD. Clueless in the face of such testosterone charged violence, the SAPD arrange to have twentieth century super lawman John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) released from his own cryogenic prison in hopes that he will be able to deal with the chaotic nature of Simon Phoenix and stop his senselessly violent rampage. Lenina Huxley is teamed up with Spartan in order to help him adjust to this brave new world. She is over-the-top with happiness at this development, as her fondness for nostagia will be sated by the opportunity to get up close and personal with a blast from the past.    Needless to say, Spartan and Phoenix clash, as old warriors are wont to do. There is enough violence, mayhem, and action to satisfy the most die hard fans of this genre. What happens will not disappoint the viewer, as old scores are settled, inequitable situations are righted, and a brave new world gets a little fine tuning for the better. This action flick, sci-fi crossover does not fail to entertain, and it does so more intelligently than most films in this genre. Make no mistake, however, while Wesley Snipes gives her a run for her money, it is Sandra Bullock who steals the show with her drolly delivered dialogue, her deft comedic timing and innate charm. Sylvester Stallone, as wooden as ever, is not even a blip on the radar.
0802130208|4.0|Toole's main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, in A Confederacy of Dunces is what makes the book so interesting. Although, Ignatius is unbelievably crude I found him to be very entertaining. He is a thrity-something year old living at home with his mother. He's had a college education, but doesn't have a job when you first meet him. Throughout the story, he took on several different jobs, including a filer at Levy Pants factory and a hot dog vendor for Paradise Vendors. At both of his jobs he caused problems. He also took notes in his Big Chief Tablets about all that he was encountering, some fact and some fiction.  <BR> <br />The story is set in New Orleans,and involves several characters for example, Myrna Minkoff, Ignatius' ex-girlfriend; Patrolman Mancuso, Mrs.Reilly's friend; and Miss Trixie, secretary at Levy Pants. All of their lives are all very different, however, in the end all of there lives intermingle through one big scence involving Ignatius in the French Quarter.<br />The book will catch your attention, and make you want to see what happens to Ignatius and the rest of the character's in the end.
6301963717|5.0|This is a different kind of gangster flick. It is an intelligent foray into the world of the roaring twenties and the corruption and speakeasies engendered by Prohibition. This money making turf is zealously guarded by rival crime bosses: Leo, masterfully played by Albert Finney, and Johnny Caspar, well played by Jon Polito.<br />Tom Reagan, beautiful played by the darkly smoldering Gabriel Byrne, is Leo's main man. Unfortunately for him, he is feeling the noose around his neck tighten, as he owes some big gambling debts that he is unable to pay. Moreover, he is head over heels in love with Verna, played with hard edged, sexual intensity by Marcia Gay Harden, who just happens to be Leo's main squeeze. Moreover, Verna's bookmaker brother, Bernie Bernbaum, played with smarmy abandon by John Turturro, has a contract on his life and is on the run. When Tom finds himself helping Bernie, he soon discovers that no good deed goes unpunished. All this makes life very complicated and difficult for Tom.<br />At times, it is difficult to ascertain who the good guys and the bad guys really are, or for whom they really work, as they all seem to march to the beat of a different drummer. There is more to what is going on than initially meets the eye. Make no mistake, this is a multi-faceted movie that works well on many levels. As with all Coen brothers' films, there is an underlay of sly humor that permeates the film.<br />The dialogue is sharp and evocative of another time, as it is laden with Prohibition era slang, and its stacatto delivery is most effective. The characters all walk the walk and talk the talk. The  performances by the entire cast are stellar. Look for Steve Buscemi in the small role of Mink, and do not blink or you will miss Frances McDormand's performance as Johnny Caspar's secretary. All in all, this is an excellent film and another feather in the collective cap of the Coen brothers.
B00004TT9X|5.0|In the first half of the year 2000, Britney Spears was at the height of her worldwide popularity. Her debut album had sold 22 million copies worldwide and her four singles had sold a combined total of 18 million copies. She was an international sex-symbol and already an iconic superstar - all by the age of 18. In May 2000, she released her highly anticpated second album Oops!...I Did It Again. It was easily the most hyped record of 2000 and sold a record-breaking 1.3 million copies in its first week of sale in the US. It went on to sell more than 10 million copies in the US alone - her second consecutive record to reach diamond status in America. Worldwide sales of the album peaked at 21 million and spawned four huge worldwide No.1 singles. One of these was Oops!...I Did it Again.<br />The single Oops!...I Did It Again was released in May 2000 - two weeks before the album. It went straight to No.1 in the UK, earning Britney her third UK No.1 single following on from Baby One More Time (February 1999) and Born To Make You Happy (January 2000). Her fans loved it and many compared it to her debut single Baby One More Time. Indeed, the beat is similar to that of Baby One More Time, but the whole concept and idea of the song is entirely different. Where Baby One More Time portrayed an upset girl grieving over losing her boyfriend, Oops!...I Did It Again showed Britney at her most cheeky. \\"I'm not that innocent!\\" she wails, and she isn't - if only on this song. There's something about the attitude of song that reflects how the public saw Britney - an innocent girl, but sexy and controversial at the same time. Her reference to the movie Titanic half way through the song was bound to please her younger fans. \\"But I thought the old lady dropped it in the ocean in the end!?\\" she says to the man who she has no trouble in seducing. The video to the song was her most elaborate to date. Baby One More Time was shocking, Sometimes was sweet, (You Drive Me) Crazy was raw and sexy, and Born To Make You Happy was emotional. The video to this song in question, however, was epic - the sets were huge, the costumes were elaborate and the choreography was complicated. Britney played the Queen on the planet Mars. While on a space visit, the object of her affection is seduced by Britney and her \\"charming\\" ways. Britney also wears a red leather catsuit - probably one of Britney's most famous video outfits after Baby One More Time's school-girl look. This CD single also includes a Bonus Track in the form of Deep In My Heart - a track taken from the European version of Britney's debut album Baby One More Time. Also included is From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart (Ospina's Millennium Funk Mix), which is just a more up-tempo version of the ballad also from the Baby One More Time album. All in all, this is an absolutely essential CD for Britney fans everywhere - buy it now from Amazon[.com]!nd Born To Make You Happy was emotional.

B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears' second album, Oops!...I Did It Again was without a doubt the most anticipated album of 2000. Her debut album, Baby One More Time was released just over a year before her second album came out, and had already managed to shift a whopping 20 million copies worldwide (13 million in the US) and earn a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the biggest selling album by a teenage solo artist of all time - and she was still only 18! So on Monday 15th May 2000, Britney Spears released Oops!...I Did It Again. It went straight to No.1 in the US the week it was released, selling a staggering 1,330,000 copies in its first week on sale - 500,000 on its first day. It is also the fastest selling female album of all-time in US history! The album also topped the charts in another 26 countries and has so far sold 21 million copies...<br />The album begins with Oops!...I Did It Again (10/10). This was the first single to be taken from this mammoth album in May 2000, where it peaked at No.1 in the UK. The choruses and verses are catchy, and the Titanic speaky-bit halfway through the song is legendary in Britney history! Track 2 in Stronger (10/10). Released in December 2000, Stronger was the third single to be lifted from Britney's second album, where it peaked at No.7. This classic pop song is one of Britney's best to date because it features her trademark funky, catchy beats and brilliant vocals. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door (10/10) is Track 3. This is a brilliant, funky R'n'B track produced by Rodney Jerkins. It features some great girl-power lyrics and great instruments. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction (10/10) is Track 4. This is a great cover of the Rolling Stones original. Britney does great justice to this track and it's the best cover version from all her albums, easily beating The Beat Goes On and I Love Rock 'N' Roll from her first and third albums. Track 5 is Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know (8/10). This is one of Britney's best ballads to date, along with I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman. Released in March 2001, Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know peaked at a lowly No.12 in the UK charts and was the final single from this album. You would've thought that the controversial beach video would have been enough to make this go Top 10, but no! So far, this is the only Britney Spears single not to go Top 10 in the UK. Track 6 is What U See (Is What U Get) (10/10). This brilliant pop stomper is another classic Britney-esque pop track with the trademark beats and traditional vocals. This should've been released as a single, instead of Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know...<br />The album continues with Lucky (9/10), which is Track 7. This was the second single to be taken from Oops!...I Did It Again in August 2000 and peaked at No.5 in the UK - but was another multi-million selling, No.1 smash all over Europe! Track 8 is One Kiss From You (10/10). At first, I really hated this song but it has grown on me a lot. This is a lazy, summers' pop song which will really relax you. It's a bit like From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart from Britney's first album, but a little more up-tempo. Definetly one of my favourites on the album. Where Are You Now (9/10) is Track 9. This is a beautiful ballad that really showcases Britney's full vocal range - something that we so rarely get to hear in most of Britney's songs. It's also the longest track on the album at almost five minutes. Can't Make You Love Me (10/10) is Track 10. Britney gets back on track, doing what she does best with this infectious pop gem. Produced by pop wizard Max Martin, it features melodic beats and a great vocal arrangement in which Britney sings about life as the international superstar that she is - a lot like What It's Like To Be Me from Britney's third album, Britney. When Your Eyes Say It (10/10) is Track 11. This is a fantastic mid-tempo pop ballad about a loved-up Britney! Written by the wonderful Diane Warren who also writes hits for massive divas such as Celine Dion, LeAnn Rimes, Toni Braxton and Whitney Houston. The string arrangement is brilliant and this song is one of the best Britney songs from all three of her albums. Dear Diary (8/10) is Track 12. This is the shortest song on the album - it's not even three minutes long. The song was co-written by Britney, but a lot of people gave her stick for writing such [bad] lyrics. OK, they're not the best songwriting lyrics ever, but give the girl credit for having the confidence to write a song! All the haters were soon silenced as Britney wrote five tracks on her third album and will probably write more for her fourth album.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />Britney's second album Oops!...I Did It Again is a must for anyone interested in Britney's music as this album really is good. The album features quite a lot of speaky-bits between tracks such as Don't Go Knockin' On My Door/(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, What U See (Is What U Get)/Lucky and Girl In The Mirror/Dear Diary. Of course, I'm being biased because I'm a huge Britney fan, but this really is a good album. If you don't have this album, buy it now to complete your Britney collection.

0767817478|1.0|I don't know where to begin...Hollywood strikes again. The powers that be decided to &quot;improve&quot; the appearance of an already aesthetically pleasing icon. Then, for months and months, the media made us endure hours of &quot;this is not your daddy's Godzilla. This is new and improved.&quot; <br />I was disappointed to see the result...a giant iguana! <br />The &quot;instant Godzilla&quot; comes across like, &quot;sugar, butter and artificial, instant junk food&quot; recipes. (Compared to products that have real ingredients and where the process is just as important as the results).<br />What a waste of film. I saw the 2000 movie from Japan. Not the best but still a sigh of relief. <br />I hope Hollywood did a better job when they remade &quot;The Ring.&quot;
0786868694|5.0|Most books about food are written by cooks who can write. Negella Lawson is writer who can cook. Her book, Nigella Bites, has the appearance and structure of a cookbook, but it is really about how she uses food to cope with suffering.<br />And suffered she has. Despite a storybook life (her mother, was a beautiful heiress, her father, one of Conservative Party's most powerful ministers), Mrs. Lawson has lost first her mother, then her sister to cancer. Recently the disease took her husband after a four year struggle.<br />Cookbooks generally don't tell you about who wrote them any more than do chemistry lab texts. Who was to know from reading the Boston Cooking-School Cook Book that a paralytic stroke prevented Fannie Farmer from attending college? Where in The Way to Cook does it indicate that Julia Childs worked for the Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of the CIA)?<br />Nigella Bites on the other hand is flavored through out by the writer's personality. We find out Mrs. Lawson has trouble sleeping some nights, she misses her sister, she suffers from the occasional hang over and doesn't like to waste food. Most of all we learn how what she feels about what she cooks. She is usually explicit about the emotional weight various recipes carry. Food is life. Eating is what separates the living from the dead. One can almost picture Mrs. Lawson in the middle of a sleepless night using the thin layers of a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich or a slice of chocolate fudge cake to buffer the darkness surrounding her. When she writes \\"you need to know there's something to stave off that moment of desolation that threatens to settle when the eating's done for the day\\" makes me wonder if the book could not have been titled The Sorrow of Cooking.<br />Because she is better looking, a better writer, and a better cook than Martha Stewart she is currently be marketed here in the United States as sort of a British-Yiddish successor to the controversial homemaker/business executive/cultural icon. I think this is misplaced, since the two women represent two different aspects of the human experience and appeal to readers for different reasons.<br />Even though the book is bit thin in terms of number of recipes (about 70 compared with 1,849 Farmer's first book) they are easy to make and highly original (deep-fried candy bars with pineapple anyone?) and the writing more than makes up for it. Can it be any surprise Mrs. Lawson won Author of the Year in the 2000 British Book Awards? This is that most rare of the genre, a cookbook worth reading even if you have no interest in cooking.business executive/cultural icon.

B00005NP04|5.0|Martina's career started slowly as her first album (The time has come) did not sell in vast quantities. I did buy it - and I've been a huge fan of Martina's music ever since. Fortunately for me, Martina's second album contained Independence day, the song which really launched her career and ensured that she could continue to record high-quality music, culminating in this Greatest hits collection, which contains all the essentials.<br />Martina has a big voice and uses it to great effect on all types of song. Many of her hits are upbeat, happy songs, typical of modern country music. There are still people who think country music is full of sad songs with not much cheer - such people should listen to some modern country - very different from the way things once were.<br />Happy girl (from her fourth album, Evolution, the one that really confirmed her as a major star) is not only typical of the songs Martina records - it also describes herself. Other great upbeat songs include I love you, My baby loves me and Whatever you say. Even in modern country, there is still room for the occasional sad song, represented here by Concrete angel and Love is the only house. Despite these songs, the overall feel of the album is upbeat. Stranger was not released as a single, but has become popular with fans, so it was included instead of Cheap whiskey, a minor hit from her first album. It's a pity they didn't include both.<br />Martina made some of the best pop-country music of the nineties and had some success in the American pop charts while maintaining her credibility with country fans.
B00005JLF5|5.0|It is beyond me why this spin-off of the original Star Trek does not garner the support that it so richly deserves. The acting, the scoring, the writing, and the set designs were exemplary in every way.<br /><br />Like most series, the first year allowed the show to \\"get its feet wet\\". But, one of the show's best installments in its entire seven-year run was \\"Duet\\", a two-actor tour de force from regular Nana Visitor and guest Harris Yulen.<br />Just this episode alone is worth the purchase of the DVD compilation.
B00005O3YU|5.0|There are plenty of Ray Charles compilations to choose from - some focusing on a particular era or a particular aspect of Ray's career. This particular compilation is the first to combine his fifties music (recorded for Atlantic) and his sixties music (recorded for ABC-Paramount) on one collection - it also includes a few tracks from more recent times.<br /><br />The most famous of his early songs is probably the often-covered Hallelujah I love her so. What'd I say and I've got a woman are among the other great songs from Ray's fifties music that are included here. All those three were written by Ray, although he also recorded songs written by others even then. Fans of Ray's fifties music will need to buy a compilation devoted to those recordings - on this set, there are just 15 tracks from this era (about right for this compilation).<br /><br />It is the sixties with which Ray will be forever associated and which is most strongly represented here. Despite Ray's ability to write his own songs, the two songs for which he is best remembered are both covers. Georgia on my mind is a Hoagy Carmichael song from 1931, while I can't stop loving you is a country song written by Don Gibson. In both cases, Ray did them his own way, broadening their appeal considerably.<br /><br />I can't stop loving you was one of many country songs that Ray adapted to the R+B style. Some of his fans deserted him, but these recordings gained him more fans than he lost. What Ray showed was the main difference between different styles of music was the presentation - not the songs themselves. His re-interpretations of country songs are represented here by tracks 1 to 7 and track 9 of CD 2. Actually, he'd dabbled with the idea in the fifties, as his cover of I'm movin' on (CD 1, track 13) shows.<br /><br />Among his other great recordings of the sixties are Baby it's cold outside (a duet with Betty Carter), Hit the road Jack (with Margie Hendrix), That lucky old sun, Yesterday and Eleanor Rigby.<br /><br />After the sixties, Ray's success was limited, but he still had the talent. In 1984, he recorded a country album of duets with various country singers - it really was a country album, unlike his sixties covers. That album is represented here by Seven Spanish angels - a duet with Willie Nelson. Other (non-country) duets from the eighties are also included - Shake your tailfeather (with the Blues brothers) and I'll be good to you (with Chaka Khan).<br /><br />The collection closes with an outstanding cover of Imagine, recorded for a French TV commercial in the late nineties.r /><br />After the sixties, Ray's success was limited, but he still had the talent.

B000002504|5.0|This is the record that made Gentle Giant the champions of progressive music in their day.<br />Octopus has every kind of musical delight. The virtuosity of the group was unexampled in popular music at that time, except for Keith Emerson of EL&amp;P. Their willingness to travel unexplored paths of composition challenged the preconceptions that dominated even the more adventurous reaches of modern music. EL&amp;P, King Crimson, and Yes dipped a toe in the water; Gentle Giant did a triple-gainer off the high board, and scored big.<br />Of course, &quot;experimental&quot; doesn't equate to &quot;good.&quot; But GG didn't shirk its responsibility to make quality music. There's no noise here, no unnecessary roughness of tone, and no flirtation with the notion that the listener's pleasure and edification is secondary to the artist's desire to be &quot;original.&quot;<br />Truly a classic of its time, that stands up well even in comparison with the offerings of Gentle Giant's many descendants.
B00006LHYC|5.0|I fell in love with Laura's voice the first time I heard her in italian. Now after 200 million albums sold in Europe and Latin America she finally attempts to conquer the North American market with her first all english album &quot;From The Inside&quot;. This album displays the multi-faceted range of Laura Pausini's voice. She is an incredible talent that must be heard for anyone who appreciates a great singing voice.For those who say they can hear her accent when she sings are truly missing the point of what music is all about.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was never a big Christina fan. I bought her first album, and I thought it was ok. But it wasn't one of my favorites. After a few years, Christina returns, having experienced more. On \\"Stripped\\", she penned 14 of the songs herself, and I'm talking about really good songs. There is a selection of beautiful motivational and inspirational songs like \\"Beautiful\\", \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Soar\\", and \\"Keep Singing My Song\\". Then there's some sexy sexual songs like \\"Get Yours Get Mine\\" and \\"Dirrty\\" which are two of my favorites. Then you have the kick a** self independence tracks like \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\". It gives a statement that needed to be made: it's ok for a guy to sing about sex, have sex with lots of different girls, but if a girl even dresses sexual, she's deamed a .... Lil' Kim's guest appearance on this track is great also. \\"Walk Away\\" is about not being able to walk away from someone you need to leave. This album has alot of great tracks. It's not your average pop cd. It's got so many different styles. \\"Infatuation\\" is my favorite. Great lyrics! Overall, I loved this CD. In my opinion, it's the best pop CD ever, being written and produced by Christina. You would be surprised. Just pick it up and enjoy it.

6305878323|5.0|This most wonderful of Disney musicals has been at the top of my all-time best movies list ever since I saw it back in 1964. It's a very humanistic, loving film, but love that has a backbone (snip-snap, as Mary poppins says). It's sweet, silly, touching and still holds up very well technically. I never fail to get a kick out of Ed Wynn (in his last movie role, the father of now deceased as well Keenan Wynn) and the tea party on the ceiling. It's an ideal antidote for the blues ... and those corny old vaudville jokes Dick Van Dyke and Ed share up there ... great fun. The message \\"Let's go fly a kite\\" -- to take some time off and enjoy life is more relevant today than it was then. It really measures up to the highest standards of family filmmaking.
1586210912|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a great book for people who want to increase their financial intelligence for the first time. Kiyosaki writes at a level easy to comprehend and understand.  By the end of this book you will have a better understanding of assets and liablitites and how to have money work for you.  I would recommend this book to any beginners in the financial world who are just getting started.  By the end of the book you'll be pumped up and excited about money and your new knowledge.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Queen was pure glam rock. Freddie Mercury was 1 in a million, his voice was the best in rock (Robert Plant's is second). He was incredibly flamboyant, and operatic and Queen definitely gave the greatest live shows of our time. They sounded like no other band with four hit songwriters who wrote many songs that would later become sports anthems or movie themes such as the amazing Flash, Who Wants To Live Forever, One Vision, We Will Rock You, We Are The Champions and Another One Bites The Dust. The 1st Disc is 70's glam rock Queen and the second disc is 80's pop rock Queen. I prefer this collection over the 2 previous Hollywood releases of 'Classic Queen' and 'Greatest Hits' because this version has one of my favorite Queen songs, \\"Innuendo,\\" and the song \\"Flash\\" that was on the original greatest hits album from 1981. The song order is also better.   The only flaw on the second disc is the recording of \\"Under Pressure.\\" This version sounds different than the one on `Classic Queen.' The base is much softer and the vocals don't flow as well.<br />A reminder: Disc Three is not a greatest hits cd.  It's a cd of mostly solo works, songs from the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, and songs from the album `Made In Heaven,' an album that came out after Freddie died.  The third disc does not do the band any justice and should be re-released with actual hits or songs from Queen during their prime years.  Hopefully, Queen's Brian May will someday release a true best-of collection with classic songs that did not make the hit chart but were true masterpieces.  I'm talking about the songs: Spread Your Wings, You Take My Breath Away, Love of My Life, Melancholy Blues, Teo Torriatte, Death On Two Legs, The Prophet Song, 39', and Seaside Rendezvous. Songs on 'Queen II' like Procession, White Queen, The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke, Nevermore and March Of The Black Queen should also not be ignored. <BR>If you want a great introduction to Queen with their most popular hits, this is it.But, if you want more on the best of Queen, I recommend you pick up 'Queen II', 'A Night At The Opera,' and `A Day At The Races.'  These are Queen's three best albums and Queen during their prime.
B00000K3CK|5.0|Like many households, for me Christmas movies are as much a part of the tradition as trees and presents.  &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; the Rankin/Bass Animagics and &quot;Miracle on 34th Street.&quot;  This Holiday classic is a nice DVD, with good quality and restored black and white.  The bonus features are slim to none, containing only a movie trailer and a talent file.<br />With Ed Gwen and Natalie Woods playing both sides of the coin, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; is a film of charming, wide-eyed cynicism.  What place does Santa Claus have in the modern world?  What place does belief and trust have in a world where Santa shows up to work drunk and Christmas is a headache to every retail and postal worker in America?<br />Gimbels may be long gone, but I am glad that &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; has persisted.  Perhaps the message of the film has more staying power than the corporations that would commandeer Christmas.<br />Like Mr. Macy says, &quot;You cannot argue with success.&quot;
0385508417|5.0|What a perfect and fun book to read just before Christmas!! I identified with the sentiments and desire to &quot;skip&quot; the whole crazy holiday frenzy!! Being the same age as Luther and Nora, I have recently had visions of doing exactly what they did.  While reading, I decided to definitely cut back on my own choas and will not send cards this year(maybe never again).  I will choose to simplify and enjoy the true spirit of the season.....family and spending time with loved ones.  This book was great fun to read and had me laughing aloud often.  I've not had so much fun with a book in ages.  A must read for empty nesters!!
B000002AGM|5.0|...brilliant.  Unlike the rather ragged orchestral playing on the Miles/Gil Porgy and  Bess, the ensemble here is crisp focused, a perfect canvas for Gil's carefull textured palette of sound, and a perfect backdrop for Miles' to show his stuff.  Here on flugelhorn rather than his customary trumpet, the variety of moods he covers is immense, from the buoyancy of the opening 'Springsville' to the Sketches of Spain predecessors 'THe Maids of Cadiz' and 'Blues for Pablo.'  We also get Dave Brubeck tune 'The Duke', Kurt Weill, and the title track (and my favourite from the album), written by Miles and Gil.  Gil's classical influences show through in the sound he coaxes from his ensemble, especially in the mid/lower range sound he gets from it in the more reflective passages, and also through the arrangment of the work, which runs along continously, like a 10 movement suite, so the numbers never feel disconnected.  Amazing how it manages to sound so seamless when it was produced from so many different takes!  Mind you, he can still swing ('New Rhumba'-phew!). This isn't the best Miles album, but it is brilliant, a great jazz recording, ignore it at your peril! <BR>And, with 17 minutes of bonus tracks, great photos, and an interesting booklet, what have you got to lose?
0060254920|5.0|My little boy loves for me to read this book to him.  I sound<br />out all growls and even give him a little tickle torture when it comes to the monters showing their nails.  A perfect \\"boy\\" book!
B00004Z459|1.0|Since it's release, I've probably heard this album all the way through well over 75 times -- involutarily.  Never in my life did I ever think that an album could be this infectious.<br />The album essentially has only one song.  That's it.  That's how original this band really is.  It's terrible.  There is absolutely no variation at all between any of the 12 tracks (notice I didn't say \\"song\\").  You can skip around all you want and you'll hear the same stupid crap -- whiny lyrics, pathetic side rapping, some really crappy programming, dropped-\\"D\\" tuning with guitar that sounds like it was played with only one finger.  No soloing, no variation, no key changes (not even between songs), no time changes -- nothing at all.  It's about as monotonous as Ben Stien's normal speaking voice from \\"The Wonder Years.\\"<br />Oh, well -- whatever sells 7+ million records.  You give a bunch of little kids some guitars and percussion and look what happens.
B000075BFK|4.0|I had this see about two weeks before it came out and I was mad to be waiting almost two years for this \\"o.k.\\" release. Sure there are tracks like Ghetto Star, Thugz Man.1&2, Fame, and Street Fame, But then theres two tracks that were on a Death Row release way back in 1999. Also my man Jazie Pha does a nice job on the many tracks he produced, but you know Pac didn't work with him. Whats next Pac & The Neptunes!!! This isn't an album were you can just kick and listen like 1999's Still I Rise, you find chaning track after track. Not a must have, but support Makaveli.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This cd gets a five star rating just because it's SOAD. Anything Metallica or SOAD is great no matter how ... it really is. I have to admit this cd is probably better or atleast more entertaining to listen to then toxicity. I just don't like the fact that they could've put this album out with 4 different covers so that people would buy all 4, but I don't think they did that on purpose. At this rate I would say why would you buy this album when there's the internet.
B00006LSM3|4.0|I've read a lot of the reviews that have been posted, and I agree with many of them - but some of the reviews are so long that I decided to write a quick one. I initially was not expecting a good album, I really don't know why, but I guess it was based off of the first single - \\"Stuck inside a Cloud\\" - which, by far, is the worst song on the album. In fact, it is the only bad song on the album. When you put the CD in, you a greeted by two songs that sound like they belong on a Traveling Wilbury's album (that is a very good thing!!!) then you will hear a dylanesque song, a great intrumental, and a really fun ukelele song \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\". Besides the one bad song - Stuck inside a cloud - the only bad thing about this album is that its only 42 minutes long.
B000001IPP|5.0|23 tight fast tracks clocking in at 44 minutes and not one of them unlistenable. Rancid's 2nd album packs a hard punch and never goes pop. Rancid continues to play the music that made them despite the fame that came with this release , they never let it go to their heads , and they never allowed themselves into the evil of the mass mainstream besides a few videos that never sold them out of their Epitaph home and they never became so famous that the teeny bopping market got in on them. Classic
0064407667|4.0|Have you ever had that feeling that you are being watched or followed, when the hairs on the back of your neck shoot up like needles.  This is what the Baudelaire orphans experince every where the go in their seemingly horrible lives.  But befor we get ahead of our selves this is the beginning of a serise of unfortunate events where the man that is causeing this tension in the orphans life is reveled.  A horriable man who will do ANYTHING to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune wich was left to the orphans when their parents, house, and all of their belongings were lost in a terriable fire.<br />This book is so great that anybody of any age can enjoy it and its pure cruelty towrads the Baudelaire orphans.  When you are done with this book you will be thanking Lemony Snicket the author for writting eight other books in the series because this book will get you so hooked after reading it that you will want to get to the nearest bookstore as soon as possible to get the next book.
B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid's first two releases self titled and \\"Let's Go\\" were a throwback to oldschool 80's style punk. They were both great albums with raw aggression and muscianship. \\"..And Out Come The Wolves\\" fails as a true punk album , the songs are more produced and mellow , the muscianship is professional and tight , and the songs are cleaned up and suitable for airplay. Since this album can't be one of the great punk masterpieces...it sure as hell is one of the greatest rock n roll masterpieces. This is a brilliant album , probably one of my favorites. It has deep insightful lyrics as only Tim Armstrong can write it , and catchy tunes that never lower itself into a bubblegum pop punk style and flavored with ska and reggae. This album seems to be plagued with cries of \\"sellout\\" and \\"Clash rip off\\"...I think when you compare Rancid's fame to Blink 182's that cry seems laughable ..and honestly I have been listening to the Clash a long long time and I fail to see any rip off similarities..yes there is a 77-81 style..but as far as the Clash ...nah just don't hear it
0151008116|4.0|Once I  was travelling through Europe on a train and at night my companions and I told each other stories to pass the time. I told them &quot;The Nose&quot; by Gogol. When I got to the part where the nose was apprehended at the border trying to escape disguised as a civil  servant, they  reacted with extreme disbelief. Gogol's story so stretched their imagination that they could no longer continue to listen to it, rather like the Japanese officials at the end of &quot;The Life of PI&quot;. The Life of Pi is gripping -- I got it yesterday, and read it this morning in one sitting. However it is slightly too &quot;cute&quot; (the tiger's name, the multiplicity of religions, etc.) to be great: it just misses.  (This is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.)
B00005JLF5|5.0|True, TNG was an amazing series.. but DS9 brought depth and arcs the likes of which Trek has never seen, and will never see as long as Berman and Braga stay at the helm. <br />Because Berman was not involved as heavily with DS9 it has been treated as some kind of ... step-child that he would just as soon erase off the face of the earth. I'm glad to see Paramount has decided to do the smart thing and release this amazing series in DVD's. Forget the VCR tapes: WAY too expensive. For the cost of 10 tapes you can get an entire series worth. Brilliant!!<br />The series starts off with the wonderful and ground-breaking Emissary where we meet the characters that we'll grow to love over the next 7 years.<br />After that we meet our old friends Q, Lhursa, B'etor and Vash and the series closes with the blood-churning \\"In The Hands of the Prophets.\\"<br />Forget looking for that abortion 'Voyager' and start watching real Star Trek at it's Finest!<br />This is a great day for Star Trek fans everywhere!
B000063UV9|5.0|This is a classic not to be missed.  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the last examples of a time when Hollywood made quality classics on a regular basis--instead of the [junk] it now generates 95 % of the time.  This movie embodies several gold standard qualities of Hollywood classics: 1) Star power and star chemistry yielding unforgettable characters 2) a well-written script that will be quoted until the end of time  3) ingenuity in cinematography and film editing.<br />1) There are many stories about how exactly Newman and Redford got cast. Some say Steve McQueen was supposed to star opposite Newman, but refused after he found out he would not get top billing.  Also, originally, Newman was cast as Sundance and Redford was Butch.  Depending on who you ask, either Redford or the Director recommended the switch.  Newman strongly backed the casting of Redford, a relatively new and unknown star at the time.  We are all glad he did.  Their chemistry is fantastically brilliant, with colorful threads of wit, humor, and humanity thread throughout their relationship.  <br />Newman, one of the finest actors of all time, projects a warm and friendly \\"old buddy, old pal\\" character as Butch Cassidy.  This leader of the \\"Hole in the Wall gang\\" is devilish, ingenious, endeavoring, and affectionate (you will love the bicycle scene with Katherine Ross).  His \\"Get rich quick\\" schemes have him and Sundance living life to the full hilt-alternating periods of lavish living, mishaps in bank/train robbing, and running/jumping/floating from a \\"out to kill\\" posse.<br />Redford's dry wit and serious demeanor nicely compliment Newman's character.  No one delivers a line like Redford, you can almost hear his teeth grinding in the background.  No scene illuminates this better than when they first arrive in Bolivia with dreams of wealth and easy living to find desolate farm land and a few goats. The wit is unsurpassed here.<br />2) Quotes/scenes that are classic, or at the very least pretty damn funny-<BR>Butch Cassidy: What happened to the old bank? It was beautiful! <BR>Guard: People kept robbing it. <BR>Butch Cassidy: Small price to pay for beauty. <br />Butch: Boy, I got vision while the rest of the world wears bifocals.<br />Butch Cassidy: You jump first.<BR>The Sundance Kid: No, I said.<BR>Butch Cassidy: What's the matter with you?<BR>The Sundance Kid: I can't swim!<BR>Butch Cassidy: Why you crazy--the fall will probably kill you!<br />Sundance: Can you take the two on the right?<BR>Butch: Kid, I think there's something I oughta tell ya. I never shot anybody before.<BR>Sundance: One HELL of a time to tell me.<br />Butch Cassidy: If he'd just pay me what he's paying them to stop me robbing him, I'd stop robbing him! <br />4) If you buy the latest release of the film, there is a bonus \\"making of\\" feature at the end.  It's a nice summary of how the cinematography, editing, music, and characters all came together to produce \\"one of the most popular screen westerns ever made, this Academy Award winning classic blends adventure, romance, and comedy to tell the true story of the West's most likeable outlaws.\\"-(back cover)  For example, the sepia toned frames of New York with Newman, Redford, and Ross superimposed give the film a vintage touch. <br />    James Dean may have defined \\"cool\\" in \\"Rebel Without A Cause\\" but Newman and Redford certainly pull no punches in presenting their definition-their wit is beyond cool.
0066214122|3.0|Crichton's always been one of my favorite authors; I knew I could count on a well-written techno thriller that I couldn't put down.  Unfortunately, this one doesn't deliver.  It's just too darn predictable!<br />Perhaps starting the book at the end of the story is too much of a giveaway (the novel starts on \\"Day 7\\" and then recounts the events of the prior 6 days).  Based on the events in the first few pages, you know exactly where the story is going to end when something is revealed halfway through the book.  Being told in the first person doesn't help either.  You know our protagonist is going to survive any of his numerous near-death encounters, as well as many of the other characters who are present in the first few pages.  This of course removes much of the suspense.<br />This is probably the most predictable novel I've ever read.  Scene after scene, as the road curved ahead, I knew exactly what was around the next bend.  Utterly disappointing in that regard.  <br />Chrichton certainly has a stock formula for most of his \\"science-gone-amuck\\" novels.  Well-intentioned scientists create something that's going to be fantastic, taking shortcuts and dangerous innovations, the technology goes rogue, people die, the technology is destroyed (or is it?).  This one's ture to that previously successful formula, but again, it disappoints.  The only Chrichton novel (or movie) that disappointed more was \\"Congo.\\" <br />That said, it's still worth the read.  I did enjoy it, and it's an interesting technology, with some interesting explanations of the problems, both technical and moral that are presented.<br />The hardcover price is outrageous, but most hardcover prices are outrageous in today's economy.  I'd wait for the paperback, or even the movie, which is sure to be made.
B00005V33C|4.0|This ELP album exhibits the very essence of the classical-progressive-rock realm. Emerson's style rings through solidly. Fantastic synthesizer work on the Moog. Excellent string-sounds, tremendous leads that Emerson is so famous for.<br />Other recommended similars: Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, (ELP) Tarkus, (ELP) Pictures at an Exhibition (live).
B00000K0EA|2.0|Although I haven't seen every Bond movie, I've seen most of them, and so call myself a Bond fan.  Now I hear \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" is the worst Bond film, but I havent seen it, so I will bestow the honor on this film \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\".  The title itself is terrible, makes no sense, and forbodes bad things to come.  <BR>You wouldn't think this is so bad by all the cool gadgets and chases, but the underlying plot, normally thrilling in other Bond films, remains utterly lacking in this one.  Terri Hatcher is hot, but boring, and Bond's nemimis in this one is weird and unimaginative (he's a media mogul, ooo scary... what ever happened to SPECTRE?).  It's hard to explain why this movie [is bad], it just does, and that's coming from a huge Bond fan.  But don't take it from me, take it from Moby (who did do a cool rendition of the Bond theme for the film) who called it the biggest peice of (expletive) he'd ever seen.  It's just that bad.
0316666343|4.0|I just finished reading this book five minutes ago.  I started it yesterday morning and spent a snowed-in Cleveland weekend reading.  <br />It's an intersting concept.  Heaven is what you want it to be.  That's what I got out of this book.  Granted, Ms. Sebold doesn't claim to be an expert on heaven or the afterlife, but she has an interesting perspective on it.  <br />Susie is murdered.  You know this by reading the first page of the book.  Her family falls apart and each family member reacts differently.  I've never had this experience, but I'm told that this is what usually happens.  The family is ultimately held together by the stalwart, eccentric Grandma Lynn.  <br />The Lovely Bones is an exploration of how the fractured family copes after a horrendous loss as much as it is a view on what the afterlife is like.  It has made me wonder what MY heaven would be like.  <br />I will read this book again and I will recommend it to others.  Don't let the other reviewer's opinions sway you.  This is a good book, but it's certainly not the best thing I've ever read.  Read it and see for yourself.  It is definitely worth your time.
B00007E8V4|4.0|Some of the people who wright reviews must be on crack, saying stupid things like \\"I don't like the first album because it's too crazy, or it's not calm enough\\". you know what that makes you look like is a wimp.  Toxicity was absolutly nothing compared to self titled, system of A down (not the down, you morons), did indead take there system to a down.  So with all the talk about \\"unreleased\\" and being stuff from way before self titled was relieased, this album has to blow you away. so warning to the loosers stay away from self titled and \\"steal this album\\" cuz you don't know anything about good music.
B00005JL2O|5.0|The first two Austin Powers movies were good but, I've got to admit, I've never laughed quite as hard as I did with Goldmember. This movie was absolutely hysterical. Michael Myers really outdid himself in this one. There were moments when I just couldn't stop laughing. It got to the point where everyone around me was telling me to hush so they could hear what was going on but I couldn't help it.<br />I haven't seen a movie that has made me laugh that much since the first Ace Ventura. You definitely need to get this one.<br />Well...what are you waiting for??? GO!
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink debut album wasn't that bad, but wasn't the best either.<BR> And I am so over all these ppl saying&quot; What about her R&amp;B?&quot; I think she still loves it, but she's not recording what &quot;L.A. told {her}...&quot; anymore.Pre-&quot;Pink&quot; days she sang in punk/ pop/ r&amp;b,&amp; gospel.It's the release of &quot;Missundaztood&quot; where she shines. She shows how versitle her voice is. I think &quot;Family Portrait&quot; &amp; &quot;just like a Pill&quot; are creative &amp; they're not your typical realtionships gone bad songs. I also love &quot;Misery&quot; w/ Steven Tyler. @ this point I think Pink can sing anything!

6305508550|5.0|I love this movie for its cynacism and biting wit. My only complaint about the DVD is the total lack of extras. The original &quot;Milton&quot; cartoons from Saturday Night Live would have made excellent supplemental material. Does anyone know why they weren't included? That said, this film is not to be missed if you enjoy a good laugh.
B00003CXAE|3.0|One of my favorites from my youth is finally out on DVD, and while it is a real pleasure to see it with the new medium's visual clarity, I have to wonder who's dumb idea it was to add so much reverb to every musical number that the characters sound like they're singing in the Holland Tunnel.  There's no such reverb on the cast recording - WHY was it deemed necessary for the DVD?  It was only by accident that I discovered that by switching off the VSS mode on my DVD player, the reverb would shut up and I could actually enjoy the musical numbers.  If you're having the same problem, try altering your VSS setting.  Other than that (and seconding everyone else's reservations regarding the DVD's near total lack of special features - for this flick, I would have liked to have seen a sing-along, bouncing-ball version... or even a karaoke track) it's still a great flick.
B00003CY6M|4.0|This is a great movie but a little predictable. I highly recomend it.
B000075BFK|5.0|You're bound to notice straight off that i gave this album five stars, this is out of respect to what tupac contributes to the album rather than a review of the album itself. I think once again, just as in \\"r u still down\\" and \\"until the end of time\\" this album should have one disc not two and they could have taken out alot of the songs that i consider fillers.<BR>Don't get me wrong i'm still a huge Pac fan and still believe he was becoming better with time, but i still feel like i'm betraying him by buying this record, as it's simply a way for Suge Knight to profit off an artist that was alive for nine months of a now seven year career at Death Row!<BR>I do like alot of the songs on the album, I think the first disk (except for the last track \\"Thugz Mansion\\"-acoustic feat. Nas) exhibits where Tupac was at as a person at the time of his murder, at least lyrically.<BR>The second disc seems to be a laid back, nostalgic sort of record, undoubtedly trying to stir up the emotions of still grieving fans!<BR>I do like the contribution of the under-rated producer 7 aurileus in the origional of \\"Thugz Mansion\\", who should be attributed with pretty much all of Irv Gotti and Murder Inc's success, and once again Johnny \\"j\\" produces a vast amount of the album and does a very good job of providing light funkiness or hard beats whenever either is required.<BR>Compared to Tupacs own records this doesnt deserve five stars, but this is barely a Tupac album at all, with the well of out-takes running a little dry for Suge Knight, he calls on alot of other rappers to help Tupac out.<BR>I'm repeating myself, but i'm still a bit dissapointed that the're not keeping Tupacs post-humous releases down to one disk, if anything just to keep up his rep with the younger fans who should be listening to his earlier stuff.<BR>Bottom line i'm stilll happy i bought this disk but i'm a huge fan already, don't make this you're first tupac album, buy \\"Don Killuminati: the 7 day theory\\" or \\"All eyez on me\\" first.<BR>  Thanx for paying attention
B000069CWE|5.0|I was never a huge fan of Hybrid Theory. The beats were often repetative and the sound seemed too thin for so much raw emotion. A huge fan of Oasis (older Oasis) and Filter, I needed that extra bite, the thrashing guitars, the heavy bass, the tones in the background. Luckily, &quot;Reanimation&quot; granated my wish.<br />Borrowing it, I was skepticle at first. However, the tracks &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; and how it blends into &quot;Place For my Head&quot; are brilliant. They are heavy and loud, but never the less very cathardic. &quot;My December&quot; is another great track. It is mellow and sad sounding, and affects me every time I hear it, which if often. &quot;By Myself&quot; took some getting used to, but with its hooks, I now listen to it frequently as well. I also like this version of &quot;One Step Closer&quot; better, but the true gem on the album is the very last track. This version of &quot;Crawling&quot; is beautiful to say the least. Rick and velvety, it is the perfect song for any occasion, whether it be dark out and you're in the city, or you alone, out in the middle of nowhere. A masterpiece, it tops off a great cd.<br />I recommmend this album to anyone, even those, like myself, felt disappointed by &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. This will deinfetly make it up to you.
B00000AOUD|5.0|For the uninformed, Jethro Tull was, and still is, one of the lesser-known British rock bands. Although they never achieved the commercial success of contemporaries The Who and Led Zeppelin, Tull were held in a much higher light by music critics throughout the world. While many of Led Zeppelin's early efforts were critically panned, writers from all sources nearly always praised Jethro Tull. Perhaps this praise comes as a result of the band's sound, which could be described as classic rock in a near literal sense. The group, led by singer Ian Anderson, relies heavily on a mix of acoustic and electric guitars, with the final touch being the presence of a flute in many of their songs. <br />Jethro Tull's most productive time as a band came, much like fellow hard rockers, in the late sixties and early seventies. After toiling in relative obscurity for several years, the Tull hit pay dirt with Aqualung, an epic hard-rocking album that would end up becoming the ensembles best-selling record. However, all was not well in Tull-ville. Critics and fans alike were describing the Aqualung record as a concept album. Ever the thinker he was, Anderson was upset over the misinterpretation of his writing and came up with a solution. He said to his fans, \\"If you want a concept album, then I'll give you a concept album.\\" <br />And thus, Thick As A Brick was born; out of nothing more than spite for those that got the wrong message out of Tull's music. Although the album doesn't have the plot of, say, Tommy, or the dark and emotional presence of The Wall, Thick As A Brick stands as a great album for completely different reasons. The album doesn't have some deep message or something to get people thinking, no. It was simply a spoof, a parody, and a total and utter joke that far too many people took too seriously. <br />Upon first inspection, it appears that Thick As A Brick is an extremely short album with very little meat and bones at all. But that isn't the case, because the record actually consists of two songs, with each one clocking in at over twenty moments. And if that weren't enough for any listener, the 1997 remaster of the LP includes two extra tracks, the first one being a live performance of the song, and the second, a very informal interview with the three `main' members of Jethro Tull - Anderson, Martin Barre and Jeffrey Hammond. <br />So what is the actual concept of this concept album? The song, the record, is actually a poem written by Gerald (Little Milton) Bostock for a competition organized by the Society For Literary Advancement and Gestation (SLAG). <br />In reality, this record is a parody; a jab at pretentious rock stars the world over. The band didn't mean to say much at all, despite thousands of people all over who claim to be able to explain what this record is about. The song was not written by Milton Bostock, it was written, like all other Jethro Tull's material, by Ian Anderson. Just listening to the lyrics, and even the album title itself, suggests that the band is doing nothing more than messing around at the expense of those who are convinced there is something bigger going on here. <br />But just because the record is a sort-of joke, doesn't mean it isn't worth listening to, as there is value in it if absorbed properly. Indeed there is a sort of underlining theme about politics and society that becomes evident upon closer inspection of little Milton's lyrics. Unfortunately, the message is rather hidden through the inaccessibility of the record on a whole. It certainly isn't something that everyone will enjoy. The fact that the entire album is only two tracks, seamed together, has and continues to be a turn-off to many people who would probably otherwise like the band. When I left my copy of the record sitting by the computer, my sister went even so far as to grimace at the track listing upon realizing the length. But then it probably doesn't matter seeing as how she wouldn't like the group anyways. <br />Thick AsA Brick is an absolutely stunning album that is almost awe-inspiring in it's construction and delivery. It almost boggles the mind when you think about how the album had to be recorded - a twenty-minute long song would require amazing planning, let alone an entire album that is one track. This is one of the albums in the history of rock and roll, along with such luminaries as Dark Side Of The Moon, Animals, and Electric Ladyland, which needs to be slowly digested over several listens to fully appreciate its scope. <br />Yeah, it's pretentious and silly. But it's that way for a reason. And that ability to be able to poke fun at oneself is a rare quality that makes Thick As A Brick especially endearing.
B00005AXEL|3.0|When I heard that Stevie Nicks had hooked up with Sheryl Crow, one of the most vapid and inexplicably well-regarded songwriters to come down the line in many years, I shuddered.  Magical Stevie joining the ranks of trendy singer-songwriters?  A frightening prospect.  Fortunately, Crow only contributes one song in its entirety, an easily-overlooked wisp of a tune called &quot;It's Only Love.&quot;  On the other hand, she does co-produce two of the best tracks: &quot;Candlebright,&quot; with its distinctive mandolin, and &quot;Sorceror,&quot; which, as the title implies, touches on the mystical themes Stevie is known for.<br />The title track is a nicely upbeat piece that could well have been a single, and &quot;Planets of the Universe,&quot; the first single proper, is also great (despite it's awkwardly-phrased title.)  Note the musical nod to &quot;Rhiannon&quot; in the guitar line.<br />After the four very strong opening cuts, the album disappointingly settles into a comfortable middle of the road pop sensibility.  It's all pleasant enough, but not particularly memorable.  Only &quot;Fall From Grace,&quot; which comes near the end, sparks of some of the life that infused the first third of the album.  Sarah McLachlan, whom I've been a fan of since 1991, contributes vocals, piano and guitar to the final track, &quot;Love Is.&quot;  But like much of Sarah's own latest album, it's rather mundane.<br />While this sort of material isn't uncommon to Nicks' solo work or to Fleetwood Mac, it isn't the music I enjoy most.  If you prefer the harder, edgier side of Stevie Nicks, this record only partially satisfies.
B00005JLEX|5.0|It is really unbelievable that this show has not been released on DVD yet. We are surely talking in millions of dollars that are not being made. Just a another quick note, when this DVD is released please make it available in region 2 (Europe) too.<BR>I am also one of those guys that has some episodes taped on VHS tapes but these tapes are quickly getting worn out!!! :(
B00005YW4H|5.0|Not for a very long time have I been this excited about a new artist.  Norah Jones is one of the greatest singers/story tellers/interpreters of music to come along in years.  My prediction is that in a few years she will become of the greatest in the panthon of female singers, taking her place with the likes of Billie Holiday, Barbra Streisand, and Ann Wilson.
0002005549|5.0|Why dont most people like sci-Fi novels? especially Greg Bear and Arthur.C.Clarke, because they concentrate more on science rather than entertainment. Michael Crichton is the only author who is not handicapped by this habit. One thing that is really good about crichton's novels is that you will never keep the book down in the middle. This time too, MC has not let us down. The book guarantees 100% entertainment. For those who fel that reading novels is a waste of time. I would advice you to read any MCs books as you will learn a lot about the subject than by reading a couple of scientific journals. &quot;Prey&quot; concentrates on AI, genetics and Nanotechnology. After 1/3rd of the novel, the pace picks up a speed that you would never have imagined. This is definitely not one of MC's best novels, but definitely he gives you more than you would have expected from the book. My advice is, get the hard back and have a nice time.
0792140346|4.0|Retrospectively the most interesting thing about Primal Fear is that it saw the first movie of actor of a generation Edward Norton.  However, this is a movie that would be worth seeing anyway.  The plot has Gere as a hotshot attorney who defends 19 year-old Aaron (Norton) after he is captured running away from the murder scene of the a bishop who he claims to have been like a father to him.  Seeming like an impossible case to win, Gere originally revels only in the prestige something so high-profile offers him, until Aaron is diagnosed with having multiple personality dissorder.<br />The cast is definitely the best thing about this movie though.  Gere is competent though not an obvious choice as the lawyer, yet the succession of breakthrough roles is very impressive indeed.  Norton is probably one of the most versatile and compelling actors I have ever seen on screen although strangely enough is only just starting to be recognised as such, mostly choosing if not indie movies then certainly ones that are often outside of the glare of Hollywood (excepting the recent Red Dragon).  Anyone who has seen Fight Club, Rounder or in particular the astounding, electric performance he puts in for American History X, can testify to this.  Primal Fear is no exception, and his performance here is probably second only to his in American History X.  There's also an appearance from Frances McDormand before fame hit, as well as Maura Tierny (ER's Abby, who is surely just waiting for her big break anytime soon), both in medium roles.  In addition, Laura Linney proves that she has more than it takes to become a leading lady in a largely unrewarding role.<br />There are a few things wrong with Primal Fear, namely the rather explicit discussions about the nature of right and wrong, which are surely obvious anyway in most lawroom thrillers.  However, it seems unfair to quibble over something that's clearly a very entertaining picture.  The only other real shame is that the movie has been made famous for its twist ending as well as for it's cast, and once you know it's coming it's all too obvious.  Aside from that though, this is not only entertaining but utterly compelling thanks to its first-rate performances.
B000000XB9|5.0|The one uniting factor on Earth that all humans share is music. Regardless or race, creed, sex, or income level, music is the one factor that acts as the lowest common denominator. It brings us together. It allows to vent our anger, fear, and frustration and to describe our love or longing. It is truly a beautiful thing. Every movie has a soundtrack. Music is the only thing that prevents my brother and I from tearing each other apart. It's the only thing that keeps me and my friends from getting bored when we're just laying on the couch in my basement staring at the stains on the ceiling. Everyone has one song that they will never forget, whether it was the song playing during their first kiss or when their mother died - music is totally Universal. And that is perhaps the most beautiful thing about it. <br />Enter Creedence Clearwater Revival, perhaps the band that proves my point more so than any on Earth. The group, lead by John Fogerty and his brother Tom, is perhaps the only band on Earth that almost utterly and completely bridges the gaps between the generations. They are the one group that, no matter how much the format changes on the local rock radio station, still gets airplay. They are the group that, even ten years from now, aunts and uncles will be blasting right in the middle of family cookouts. Folks walk around school halls blaring Suzie Q on their Discmen, and Jeff Bridges blasts Lookin' Out My Backdoor in his tape deck while smoking a J in the film The Big Lebowski. The group appeals to an almost ridiculously wide cross-section of human beings. <br />But what is it about Creedence Clearwater Revival that does this? I suppose that if we knew, then other bands would have the same timeless quality about them. But we don't, so it seems that only a handful of artists achieve the sort-of universal appeal of Creedence - the only obvious one being the Beatles. <br />But the peculiar thing about Creedence is that they have achieved this universal appeal on the strength of a single Greatest Hits package and a number of singles from their heyday in the 1960s and &#14570;s. The group's original studio albums are all extremely difficult to find in CD format, yet they live on as legends. The Beatles, on the other hand, have a vast discography that easily includes over three hundred official and unofficial releases. Collectively, the group known as Creedence Clearwater Revival is a mystery.... Well, that is to say that their success is a mystery. How do they hold up so well when other, more popular acts of years past have crumbled and become the subject of another episode of VH1's Behind The Music? <br />The answer really lies in the group's sound. CCR, or \\"Cree-dance\\" as my friend likes to call them, are a unique entity. Although hailing from the Bay area, John Fogerty (lead guitar, vocals), Tom Fogerty (guitar), Stu Cook (bass), and Doug Clifford (drums), created a sound that was a far cry from what was being released at the time. While other groups in the San Francisco area were living in communal households and unleashing psychadelic grooves on the rest of the world, CCR was creating a sound all their own - a sound that would have you believe the group hailed from the South. It's an exciting blend of honky-tonk, blues, R & B, jazz, and just plain old rock & roll. They did, however, share one thing with the other, progressive groups that called the Bay area home: a political conscience that had an effect on the band's lyrics and musical approach. <br />\\"Chronicles Volume 1 - The 20 Greatest Hits\\" is a 1976 release by Fantasy Records collecting all of the group's singles (with the exception of Born On The Bayou) and putting them onto one disc that provides a nice retrospective look at the band's rise and fall. The record for all extents and purposes is essential. No - essential isn't a strong enough word here. This record is absolutely necessary for any person with an appreciation for rock and roll. Even if you aren't a fanof older music, God forbid, Creedence is an easily accessible band with a very enjoyable sound that appeals to every generation. <br />In my home for example, it's not unusual to hear Chronicles blaring from two rooms at once - both my mother and father are fond of the group as well. And last year, on the two-hour ride home from our family reunion my brother put Chronicles into the Windstar's six CD changer. The entire trip home everyone in the car - myself, my brother, my sister, mother and father - was tapping their feet, rapping their hands and singing along with the fantastic, bluesy voice of John Fogerty. It was one of those moments of Zen where everything seemed right in the world, even if only for a second. My best friend's father also has the record, as does my best friend himself and two other kids that I'm chummy with. And the just last week in the hallowed halls of my school, I laid witness to a young man walking by me while singing joyfully along to Susie-Q. I even burned a copy of the record for a friend's twelve-year-old brother! Just a few examples of the power Creedence Clearwater Revival has over every generation. <br />Of the singles that CCR released during their short but significant career, 15 charted in the top ten on the singles charts (all here except for the previously mentioned Born On The Bayou), but the group never really achieved the same popularity as other sixties groups; proving that the band was \\"popular, but not hip.\\"

B000002UDB|5.0|This is a very trippy album, and with songs like Flying, Blue Jay Way, and I Am the Walrus, you kind of forget where you are at the moment.  But the greatest songs of all time are on this CD.  Strawberry Fields Forever and Peny Lane are masterpeices.  Baby You're A Rich Man is the second best B-side (second to Rain) by the Beatles, and Hello Goodbye is just a silly pop song.  You mother should Know is actually quite a catchy tune.  Magical Mystery Tour and The Fool on The Hill are nice.  And can we forget All You Need Is Love?  It's so cool!  I'm 15, and I once went into a sports bar with my friend and I went to the jukebox and played All You Need Is Love.  Everybody looked at me strange, but it was cool showing people such an awesome song like that!  A great CD!  <BR>This really shouldn't be considered an album, because the Beatles made a policy of not putting singles on their albums, so their audience would have something new to listen to.  Do you know what?  Their are...one, two, three, four, five singles on this album!  Only six new songs!  But they're good.  Very good.  This is the best Beatles CD, but it's not the best album, if you know what I mean.  It is both a soundtrack for the film, and a greatest hits album.  For 1967.  Which is quite amazing, because this &quot;greatest hits album&quot; would top any other greatest hits album by any other band!  And this is just 1967 for the BEatles!  Wow!
B000068PQ0|5.0|Enter The Flaming Lips (God I love doing that `enter' thing). For months now, all I've been hearing is high praise for a group that I've never heard of. \\"Album of the year!\\" fellow Epinioners cried to the high heavens! So, trusting the critical opinions of some of the better members at Epinions, I headed out to the record store determined to get myself a copy of Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots at any cost. Little did I know that the `any cost' would end up being over $25 Cdn. Which, in case you aren't well versed in American dollar to loonie conversion ratio, is a lot. A ridiculously large sum of money for a record - especially considering that I had just purchased the Paul McCartney live double album for half that price. <br />But, I clenched and reached into my back pocket and shelled out the cash for it, with that little nagging voice in the back of my head just dumbfounded at my reckless spending. This had better live up to the mountains of praise heaped upon it, or I'm not going to be pleased.... <br />The Flaming Lips are a ragtag group of fellows who hail from Oklahoma. Wayne Coyne, the group's mastermind, brought the Lips together in the early eighties along with his brother and a select group of musicians. At first, the group specialized in what was essentially noise, gaining a cult following among stoned College students the world over. But in the years since their formation, they've honed their sound, despite the departure of several members including Wayne's brother and a revolving door behind the drum kit. But the Flaming Lips trekked on, scoring a major label deal with Warner Brothers and even scored a hit in 1995 with a song titled She Don't Use Jelly. But despite mainstream success, the band continued their wild experimentation, progressing even further and further into the unexplored realms of rock music. The few fans they had garnered with their hit were soon alienated by the vastly experimental Zaireeka, a collection of four CDs, all with the sametrack listing, that were intended to be played together simultaneously on four separate record players. Understandably, it was a commercial bust but is still to this day a required experience for every audiophile dork on the planet Earth. The Flaming Lips followed Zaireeka up with a slightly more accessible album, 1999's The Soft Bulletin. Hailed by critics everywhere as the record of the year, The Soft Bulletin built on Zaireeka's almost orchestral magnificence, extending the group's repertoire to include synthesizers, heavily processed drum tracks, and digitally altered vocals. <br />Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots is The Flaming Lips latest release, an album in which the group took their previous works and both built on them while also going back and delving further into the many avenues of musical exploration. Others have hailed Yoshimi... as the record of the year, claiming it to be an exhilarating and complex masterpiece that just begs to be listened to, enjoyed, experienced, and thoroughly dissected. Message boards everywhere were swamped with threads declaring the same thing. Is it all hype? Well, no, because it's not hype if it's warranted. For maybe the first time in a long while, the machine has been singing the praises of an album that actually deserves the acclaim that has been heaped upon it. Without flinching, I can say, right here and right now, that The Flaming Lips - an album from which I've never heard a single song from in the past - have produced the greatest rock album of 2002, and perhaps the greatest rock album in the last five years. <br />Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots is a very complex album, which is perhaps why it will never receive any sort of major mainstream attention. For sure, there will be people who don't like it; people who are trying to push the door open on the music when it is clearly labelled a `pull.' If you aren't prepared to give the album a chance, the possibility of garnering any enjoyment from it is, frankly, little to none. Upon first listen, Yoshimi is a very harsh record, cold and sterile in its approach. The guitar parts are few and far between, and there's definitely not an unaltered, straight drum track on the album. Whirring, clicking, and random blips are frequent, popping up at nearly every juncture. Yet, somehow, it works. It all fits together, almost seamlessly, leaving you breathless and wondering just how it can all piece together and stand as a cohesive unit. The blips, the processed drums and vocals, and the synthesizers combine to create a sort of unorthodox melody that, even though it probably shouldn't be logistically, is pleasing to the ear. Pieces abruptly shift in tempo mid-song, and the many synth effects are harsh and lifeless on their own; yet it still works. It's eerie; it's beautiful. It's just... It just is. Yoshimi... seems to have an almost otherworldly quality to it; a quality that is indescribable - it sits just on the edge of your mind, but you can't quite force it into words. <br />Wayne Coyne's voice is absolutely breathtaking in it's pure simplicity and level tone. It has an almost hypnotic quality to it that serves to mesmerize and draw the listener further into what is actually going on. You can almost feel the blips coming from behind you, and Coyne's breath on the back of your neck as he sings. My mouth had effectively dropped completely after the second listen. Still, there's another aspect to the album, is it's simplicity. Not the actual music, but the lyrics. They tell such a childish and silly story that it gives much of the album a dreamlike quality to it that it wouldn't otherwise have. And the lyrics are so simplistic that it leaves the listener to wonder about some type of higher meaning. Is this really about a little girl fighting evil robots, or is it a lyrical parallel to something more meaningful: a man's fight for his life, good and innocence prevailing over evil, the little guy versus the large corporations? It seems almost asif Coyne has left enough of a mystery to the lyrics that they can apply to pretty much whatever the listener might think they do.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I first saw this movie a few months ago and I cannot believe that I have been going on so long without seeing it! Most people have either seen it when they were younger and have loved it, or haven't seen it yet, so if you're one of those people that haven't seen it, go buy it and se it, I promise it is great.  First of all it is an 80's movie, second of all it involves pirates and hidden treasure and third of all, it's an adventure set on a rainy day! AAAND Mikey and Brand live in a really cool house:)!  There isn't one bad thing that I say about this movie, it's such a classic!  The DVD is especially cool since there are extra features including deleted scenes and (this is really great) a track with the all of the goonies talking over the movie, commenting on what they remember.  This is deffinately one of those special movies that most everyone likes and if you haven't seen it I HIGHLY reccomend it!
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Another Blondie compilation?  Oh no!  But wait, this is the one to have.  Not only is it remastered, but it features the song which really started it for them in Australia - In the Flesh. I also have the compilation from 1990 called &quot;The Best of Deborah Harry and Blondie&quot; which featured &quot;I Want that Man&quot; and &quot;Sweet &amp; Low&quot;, but strangely ommitted &quot;In the Flesh&quot;. Admittingly, this new collection doesn't feature &quot;I Want that Man' or other Debbie hits such as &quot;Rush Rush&quot; or &quot;Backfired&quot;, but this is a Blondie only collection - and one which includes the 1998 hit single &quot;Maria&quot;.  May Blondie live on forever!  Add this to your collection now!
0066214122|5.0|Why dont most people like sci-Fi novels? especially Greg Bear and Arthur.C.Clarke, because they concentrate more on science rather than entertainment. Michael Crichton is the only author who is not handicapped by this habit. One thing that is really good about crichton's novels is that you will never keep the book down in the middle. This time too, MC has not let us down. The book guarantees 100% entertainment. For those who fel that reading novels is a waste of time. I would advice you to read any MCs books as you will learn a lot about the subject than by reading a couple of scientific journals. &quot;Prey&quot; concentrates on AI, genetics and Nanotechnology. After 1/3rd of the novel, the pace picks up a speed that you would never have imagined. This is definitely not one of MC's best novels, but definitely he gives you more than you would have expected from the book. My advice is, get the hard back and have a nice time.
0066214122|2.0|Given several hot new techs to play with, Crichton mangles his ambitious introduction to the promise and perils of each.  Long-winded, particularly at the beginning (easily half the book is consumed by character development that eventually goes nowhere), even still somehow the setup is left half-baked by the time an attempt to patch plot-holes appears at the end.  Scenes stolen from &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; appear without the benefit of Racquel Welch or Sigourney Weaver.  I agree with another reviewer - this book reads more like Koontz than Crichton (that claim not intended to impugn the former!).  What a disappointment - would be rated a three, but docked a point since it comes from a master.
B00004X01U|3.0|Inevitably, the album which followed 'Ray Of Light' would pale in comparison to that artistic apex. One would expect progress from her that's perpetual, but on 'Music' it sort of stagnates. Though, reluctantly, I will site 'Ray Of Light' in explaining my point by saying there are two aspects of this album which should have carried over. First of all, the William Orbit arrangements were far superior to Mirwais' which, in my opinion are weak and in some cases unnecessary. Take for example 'I Deserve This.' I think this song would have been better with guitar and vocals sans electronic blips and bleeps. Or &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; which makes you wonder if your CD is skipping. Along the same vein, the vocoder was over-used and ends up becoming a tired studio effect rather than bringing the songs to a new plateau. The only real poignant moment on the melancholy 'Paradise Not For Me' is when her voice breaks as she sings for the last time,&quot;into your eyes, my face remains.&quot; After stunning me with her vocal ability on 'Evita' and 'Ray Of Light' my argument against the vocoder is only made stronger. Secondly, whereas 'Ray Of Light' was an intimate affair, this record seems a bit superficial. Perhaps Madonna wanted to avoid her work being weighed down if she continued to tackle serious subject matter such as the birth of her child, past sins, spirituality and self-discovery. Another complaint is that some of the songs sound reminiscent of past Madonna causing the listener to doubt the notion that this album is progressive. &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; reminds us of &quot;Thief Of Hearts&quot; and &quot;Amazing&quot; that of &quot;Beautfiul Stranger.&quot; Comparisons aside, &quot;Music&quot; is a great dance song providing one of the albums camp moments with,&quot; Hey Mr. DJ put a record on.&quot; &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is another great dance song, though I am undecided about the lyric,&quot;like a bird on the wingy....&quot; Other standouts are &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; one of the best songs she has written in recent memory and &quot;Gone&quot; another melancholy track. Despite my previous comment about &quot;Amazing' it has a great '60s retro feel to it which makes it at least memorable. All in all, the album is good, but not her best. Madonna probably knew this when she sang,&quot;What did you expect? I'm doing my best.&quot; Still, I consider this album a disappointment in comparison to her previous works. Let's just hope Madonna will return and astound us all once again
B00001MXXH|5.0|If you haven't seen Ferris Bueller's day off, you should.  Ferris is, well, taking a day off from school with his best friend and his girlfriend and they are going to do anything and everything while their nosy principal is trying to catch Ferris in the act.  If you like classic 80's movies, this one will soon be at the top of your list.  &quot;MR. ROONEY&quot; :) That's about all there is to say, oh and the soundtrack is really great :u).
6305263248|4.0|Deniro is excellent in it, fans of the Professional will recognize Jean Reno as his french sidekick. Not your run of the mill spy movie becuase theres no fancy gagdets or unbelievable [things] going on. Just straight up wits and intuition lead Deniro on his path. Very realistic downtown gun battles and car chases because lots of innocents get wasted, and you as well as I would hate to be in a French bistro on the day it all went down!
B00005JL78|4.0|Based on P. K. Dick's short story, and blessed by sure-fire duo of director Spielberg and star Tom Crusie, \\"Minority Report\\" would fascinate many film fans, but that's not in the same way as \\"Blade Runner\\" did.  It's more like \\"Indiana Jones\\" in sci-fi area; it is always moving and entertaining, but the dark world that P. K. Dick's world represented is much modified for wider audiences.  But still, \\"Minority Report\\" delivers much.<br />The year is 2054.  Tom Cruise is a chief detective Anderton at Department of Precrime, where he and his team are dedicated to their mission; that is, to stop the crimes that have not happened yet.  Helped by three \\"pre-cogs\\" floating in the water, they can detect the time, and persons that would be involved in the crime, and hurry to the crime scene.  But what if there's a flaw in the system?  What if the oracle of precogs is wrong, accusing of the wrong person?<br />Anderton, who has a sad memory in the past (which would be revealed later in the film), could shake off the doubt even before the strong argument from the hotshot agent sent by  Department of Justice, Colin Farrell, who obviously does not share Anderton's thought.  But still Anderton believed that he could keep on doing his job in order to elinimate all the crimes from his district ...  until he is made to see something too  unbelievable.<br />I just introduced the opening part of this long film (running time being almost 150 minutes), but you get the drift.  There are great chase scenes, hauntingly realistic picture of the future world, and equally impressive acting from the leading actor Tom Cruise, whose role is not 100% heroic.  But it is Spielberg as gifted storyteller who really stands out, leading us to the end of rather stretched story (and, inevitably, the story is greatly changed from the original).<br />The vision of the future is surely impressive, but if you're looking for the dark images of \\"Blade Runner\\", you will be disappointed.  Remember, it is Spielberg, and his previous work \\"AI\\", which was once attached to Kubrik, is not a good example of describing the relentlessly cold world.  It is similar to \\"Total Recall\\" essentially, only without the graphic violence Arnie and Sharon had to suffer.  But, beware, Tom's character too in fact suffers a very painful scene (oh, eyes).<br />The film presents effective actions, and as I said, its visuals are impeccable, but as you know, Steven sometimes overreaches himself, and he did it again.  To me, those \\"yoga\\" and \\"meat\\" and, well, as I said \\"eyes\\" should have been left in the cutting room.  They are his brand of grotesque \\"humor\\", I know that, but they are also all out of tune in the final result.<br />As for Tom Cruise's career, I can say \\"Minority Report\\" is the best so far since his film-producing partnership with Paula Wagner started, being much superior to \\"Mission Impossible\\" and its sequel.  However, it is also notable that supporting roles are a bit weak and unconvincing, even with the inclusion of Max Von Sidow and Lois Smith.  It may be batural result for our attentions are all supposed to go to the lead Tom himself, and in this case the story requires so.  That is why the conclusion is not as strong as the impressive first half, and even his fans would admit that the latter half of the film need more polishing.  The original idea about detecting future gets lost among the muddled wrap-up, and sometimes you wonder at the film's inconsistency, like; \\"Why can't they think of this while they can do that?\\"                   <br />But as a whole \\"Minority Report\\" is a good work, but not as good as raving reviews of some critics suggest.  I say so, because I like to see good storytelling, and you can find it there, but there is also too incredible moments and plot holes, which are barely covered by the director's great skills.
B00000DQSF|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever made! Eric Clapton left Cream after hearing this album because he was so disgusted with what he was doing in comparison to the band.<BR>The Band captured a totally unique sound in this album combining roots music, with their funky genius and three skilled vocalists. And they put it together with a structured looseness that adds to the rootsy feel. If you don't own this album then you're missing out on the greatest american album ever recorded!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Her music is hauntingly beautiful!!  Norah sounds fabulous! I love this CD.
B000066NW0|5.0|When Avril's first hit came out, complicated, I never gave it much thought. A few months later I heard people talking about it and decided to give it a try. I'm not usually a fan of this t ype of music, but this cd is worth every penny and there is something for everyone. I listen to this cd NON STOP. Definately a good buy. My favourite songs are....<br />Too much to ask, Things I'll never say, Sk8r Boi, Anything but Ordinary, and I'm with you. <br />Don't wait any longer, this cd is the best one out there
B000005RR0|5.0|Although they made a mediocre album or two in this period 1971 - 1993, it's probably my favourite era in their career. I mean, who can dispute that Start Me Up was one of the best classic rock songs of the 80s? This hits collection is not arranged chronologically but it contains the raucous and controversial Brown Sugar and the bluesy Wild Horses from 1971, the Las Vegas-inpired Tumbling Dice of the next year, the aching ballad Angie from 1973 and the anti-journalistic dig It's Only Rock `n Roll, recorded in 1974 after they got some bad press. Later the band moved to a more groovy sound with Hot Stuff, ladled out emotion on Fool To Cry and made a nod in the direction of disco with the entrancing Miss You. What I miss here, is the weird country song Far Away Eyes from the same album. There's also Emotional Rescue, sung in Jagger's famous falsetto. Everybody knows the gripping ballads Waiting On A Friend from 1981 and Undercover Of The Night from '83. Another sad omission, this time from the Steel Wheels album is the wonderful Blinded By Love, although Rock And A Hard Place was also a good choice. In the 60s they reinterpreted the blues and created incredible psychedelic rock. The above period saw them taking different directions again, everyone a winner. Jump Back is a brilliant showcase of the greatest band in the world's fertile middle period.
B000005JA8|1.0|Cacophonous, unskilled, poorly executed, drivel.  I wouldn't be at all saddened to go the rest of my life without hearing this tripe again.  Come on, people - not everything that is difficult to appreciate is necessarily good.  I'll assert that you'd have better luck trying to appreciate a jackhammer - at least that's likely doing some useful work.  P U.
B00005JKZ2|5.0|This video is the best video EVER!!! It is a mix of stunning science fiction and laugh - out- loud comedy. i have rented this movie 5 times before i bought it. It is WAY better than Men in Black and better than most science fiction i saw. If your reading this right now, i say BYE IT IMMEDIETLY!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, is a magical film about Belle, \\"a beauty but a funny girl\\" who loves books and wonders \\"there must be more than this provincial life!\\" Belle wants ADVENTURE! She is a marvelous protagonist because so many can relate to her. Yes, Belle is a dreamer but also has a strong, courageous heart to make her dreams come true. She is inspiring because she maintains a balance of her desires for a better life by finding  some joy in every day, no matter what the circumstances are.<br />One day, through an unexpected turn of events, she finds herself locked in a dungeon for the sake and love of her elderly father.  I like how she thinks of him before herself.  That is love.  Only when the Beast, a cruel and hideous monster who once was a prince, (and still is but must find a way to bring out the good in his heart for all to see to break the spell) sends her father away and she doesn't get to say goodbye, does she realize the permanence of her decision.  She has lost \\"her father, her freedom and her dreams in one day.\\" However, dreams have a way of never dying.  As long as they are alive in our hearts there is always Hope.  I love the way throughout this movie this theme of hope and patience is repeated over and over.<br />BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has it all--fantastic characters (I love them all, even the bad ones, but must say, besides Belle and the Beast, I love Lumiere the best) and the voices, lively entertainment, a beautiful soundtrack (along with a new song \\"Human Again\\",) a new full sequence of \\"Be Our Guest\\" (well done!) and the rainbow of emotions conveyed: longing, fear, anger, sadness, smiles, laughter, loyalty, looking on the bright side, being courageous and having hope and patience. Also, I love to witness the contrast between the good and bad characters in Disney movies. What a great character study, always! But the transition of the Beast into a true prince at heart, is my favorite to watch; all it took was the right person to help him see the Beauty IN the Beast!<br />I deeply appreciate BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and movies like it which are wonderful reminders of so many valuable lessons:<br /><br />1.) Don't judge a person solely by their outward appearance but by their heart. The inner person of the heart--that is who one really is. The heart can not be hidden, it WILL be revealed, but we must have patience to wait for this.<br />2.) Trust your heart and listen to it--Always.<br />3.) With patience and love, your dreams can come true.<br />4.) Never stop believing in yourself first. Because then no matter how things turn out, you are strong and proud of yourself.<br />5.) Remember that showing kindness and compassion to others is the key to inner peace and true happiness. Life isn't about receiving but about giving--of ourselves.<br />I applaud Disney on this excellent movie about following your heart even when it is difficult, because with enough heart and patience, everything in your life can turn around. 10/10 stars.  Thank you, Amazon. Red roses for everyone involved in this awesome, inspiring movie that won the Golden Globe for Best Picture.<br />Soar!my favorite to watch; all it took was the right person to help him see the Beauty IN the Beast! <br />I deeply appreciate BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and movies like it which are wonderful reminders of so many valuable lessons:<BR> <BR>1.)

B00005JL2O|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie. While some of the movie is rehashed jibberish from the previous two episodes, it is still appropriate and very funny rehashed jibberish.  Now saying that, there is also a few neat twists in this movie that I didn't expect. You, too, won't see it coming.<br />I was impressed with the deleted scenes. They were in very good digital quality as though they could just be slipped right in with the movie and you wouldn't notice the difference in picture quality. I've noticed many DVD movies have crummy picture quality when viewing the deleted scenes. A big bummer, but understandable. But not here, the deleted scenes look fantastic and I appreciate that. Also, I thought that the deleted scenes should have been kept in the movie. They were funny and relatively short. There must have been a good reason to pull them, I just don't see why.<br />They put some nice touches on several special effects scenes, too. I love special effects and am impressed with what they've done here.<br />Austin Powers: In GOLDMEMBER is clever, in fact, it's done so cleverly that it really does seem like stupid and senseless intertainment. But that's Austin Powers for ya. I'm impressed and grossed out all at the same time. It's a fun escape for awhile and I'm sure you'll enjoy it, too.
B000002J29|5.0|&quot;Seconds Out,&quot; Genesis' 1977 double live album, is arguably their best live album, and it's also one of the best live albums ever made. The band roar through many of their prog rock gems dating from 1971 to 1976, such as &quot;The Carpet Crawlers,&quot; &quot;Firth Of Fifth,&quot; &quot;Squonk,&quot; and their 25-minute magnum opus, &quot;Supper's Ready,&quot; all played with tremendous power &amp; precision. Listening to this live set, you can *feel* the band's live electricity. &quot;Seconds Out&quot; is also a marvelous opportunity to hear Phil Collins' excellent vocal interpretations of Peter Gabriel-era material. Phil steps up to the mike with gusto, and does great justice to the Gabriel-era songs, as well as the post-Gabriel stuff. &quot;Seconds Out&quot; is brilliant live Genesis from start to finish. The band's stunning, unforgettable performance of &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; alone is worth the price of admission, but all the way around, this is truly an outstanding concert. &quot;Seconds Out&quot; is also a fond farewell to guitarist Steve Hackett, who left Genesis around the time of this live album's release. So, what are you waiting for? Buy it, and experience Genesis in all of their live prog rock glory. :-)
B000059ZLH|5.0|DT is undoubtedly one of the greatest prog bands of the 90s. This DVD shows them at its peak performace on stage, including classic tracks along with their recent hits. The inclusion of A Change Of Seasons in it full 25 minutes is remarkable. 5.1 audio is superb, video is very good also. DVD edition is full of features, including chapters devoted to the crew and the fans, two indispensable components for a great tour. Several tour photos are included also. A must for any Dream Theater fan.
B000002H97|5.0|I never really like metallica. But one day i decided to buy it because everyone i mean everyone thought it was great. as soon has i listened to it i fell in love with metallica. i loved them so much i bought several of their old albums also. i still like this on the best by far. their best songs include enter sandman, the unforgiven(wich is not metallica's style at all but is still good)and maybe sad but true.<BR>i would have payed 50 bucks for this album. it is well worth it!
B00000I8UJ|3.0|Throughout GO, Dexter has a huge, fat sound. It really tugs you when he holds one of those low tones. I was really excited to get this CD and listen to it. I can understand that its balance and craft is really appreciable. However, I think it is boring. He mainly follows the melody line ad nauseum, with the odd flourish that uncomfortably borders on liquid cheeze. Kind of a diet-Jazz, it holds its own, but I think the songs he picked drag it down. Worth checking out, though, to make your own opinion.
B00005JLWL|5.0|Equilibrium is the best sci-fi action thriller I've seen in years, thanks to an interesting story, Christian Bale's terrific performance, and what's simply the most creative, exhilarating action sequences I've seen since The Matrix.  The movie's serious story plays well with the expertly choreographed action.  The final fight sequence, with Bale going through scores of soldiers with handguns, assault rifles, swords, and finally concluding with a pure gun-kata battle (where two people face off in a martial arts form of gun combat), is the most exciting finale I've seen all year.
0385508417|2.0|As a gift from a Christian friend, this book made me remember all too well what the &quot;Feast of Saturnalia&quot; was all about for those many, many years we, too, celebrated Xmas, not knowing the TRUTH about this pagan Roman festival.<br />The grumbles and sighs from the Krank couple, to the shunning of the neighbors, is right on the mark as far as Christian Americans and their thoughts and deeds during the Xmas &quot;holiday&quot; season.<br />The &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude of their neighbors reminds me of Christians around the world who have never thought to research the truth about Xmas, beginning with the fact that it was illegal to celebrate this pagan holiday in early America.<br />It's really too bad that Grisham didn't take it one step further, and let the Krank family happily discover the truth about the timing of the Saviour's date of birth during the Feast of Tabernacles and then allow others reading the book, to know this information, too. But then, TRUTH doesn't always SELL all that well as most folks don't want to let go of what they preceive as their warm fuzzy blankets of untruth, like Xmas.<br />It seems to prove the old saying- GO ALONG TO GET ALONG. But, then what does that say about who we're following? Man or the Creator?<br />Grisham gave a truthful insight into how others treat neighbors/friends when you stop believing and doing what they believe and do. Just going to the mall and listening to the complaints about buying your crabby Uncle Joe a tie he will probably hate or return, should be enough to make people stop and think...what is Xmas really all about and who's idea was it?
B00005JLF5|5.0|....  It is one of the best television shows ever produced and takes Trek to a whole new level.<br />I was never much a fan of Star Trek until this show came along. DS9 is light years ... ahead of ...Voyager and  ... Enterprise.<br />The cast was amazing & you really grew to love the characters. Much more an ensemble piece, we were  not force-fed heavy \\"star\\" episodes such as TNG, Voyager .... and now Enterprise. In essence thsi show gave everyone a chance to shine..even the minor characters such as Female Founder, Weyoun, Damarr, Rom, Nog, Leeta, Vince Fontaine, Kai Winn, etc. Very strong writing and excellent story arcs.<br />In all, this is a welcomed addition to any DVD library.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Reign of Fire has good action, great special effects, and fine performances, but there's little else about the movie that stands out.  It feels a little too small-scale given the premise and it never delivers the all-out action it seems to promise.  For more enjoyable post-apocalyptic action with Christian Bale, check out Equilibrium instead.
0385508417|5.0|I loved this story and will add it to my other holiday favorites such as The Christmas Box by Richard Paul Evans! Also highly recommend Shade of the Maple and The Gravel Drive by Kirk Martin. All are great Christmas gifts and will touch your heart!

B0000073BG|5.0|Another must have album, expecially the final suite, which was inspired by Rimsky/Korsakov's original Scheherazade, which is one of the most beautiful prog suites ever, that I will bring to a desert island naturally !!<BR>But proceeding by order, the album starts with the remarkable intro at the piano of &quot;TRIP TO THE FAIR&quot;, which is in the vein of the best stuff of classical music;then it continues with the fantastic introduction of the finest femal voice ever (in my opinion) according to the &quot;fairy-tale&quot; romantic style...afterwards a short jazzy/pop solo to conclude the track, before introducing the light and quite easy song &quot;The vultures fly high&quot;,whose melody is captivating, thanks to Annie's magical interpretation ... the same consideration, of course, I have to do for the mythical ballad &quot;Ocean Gipsy&quot;, which moreover adds the final fantastic crescendo, which alone makes this song well worth checking out.Finally I have to describe the emotion and the feelings too, which are brought about the incredible mood of the Title-track SUITE: it's so enriched with beautiful themes and fantastic arrangements, that it's better if you check it out soon!! Nevermind if you are a critic of classical music, because Renaissance have changed the original opera for its major part, making the concept of  &quot;1001 nights&quot; from &quot;Arabian nights&quot; more captivating and sensible (always according to my opinion).<br />Highly recommended!! Buy this desert island record and you won't be disappointed...
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes was so amazing i dont kno where to start. This memoir was beautifully written. I laughed with Frank, and cried for him. Unfortunatly after reading this book i stopped reading in general because i was unable to find anything topping Angela's Ashes. This is a must read for all mature readers.
B000000132|5.0|My personal favourite album by Renaissance, I choose this one along with &quot;Scheherazade&quot; and &quot;Ashes are burning&quot;, followed by their first symphonic albums with melodic and pop colours: &quot;Novella&quot; and &quot;A song for all season's&quot;(these records having a few weak moments and a lot of memorable ones!!).<br />&quot;Turn of the cards&quot; is a poetical and monumental romantic album too, equal to the best Yes albums and sometimes giving something more...well the first track &quot;RUNNING HARD&quot; is characterized by a fantastic epic piano intro, followed by the magical introduction by Annie Haslam, who performed according to her finest voice-tone ever!! A great performance and absolutely flawless too...&quot;Think of you&quot; is a sweet song, like a &quot;fairy-tale&quot;, while &quot;Things I don't understand&quot; is characterized by the final angelic voice's breakthrough, after the last symphonic excursus at the piano, enriched with the outstanding colors of Annie's voice, whose abilty to harmonize the melody is enormous and wonderful as well!! &quot;Black fame&quot; and the arrangement of Albinoni's Adagio (&quot;Cold is being&quot;) are worth songs and an excellent interlude towards the final mini-suite &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, which is enriched with amazing themes and the story of a famous russian dissident as well, even if the lyrics aren't always inspired (well the focuse is more on the instrumental performance than on the lyrics,nevertheless, is anyway flawless)<br />Highly recommended!! Absolutely a must have album from Renaissance ...
B0000457AW|5.0|This is the first music I heard from KC. &quot;Islands&quot; music was described to me, before I got to listen to it, as jolly music done by foolish beer-drinkers, and as a non-english speaker I confused &quot;Islands&quot; with &quot;Iceland&quot;.<br />I listened to it as a dreamer, and although it still sounded &quot;human&quot; it did trip me out. To me this was not the most powerful Crimson but the mysterious and appealing ambiances of this music prepared high emotions for the times I would discover the further albums.
0345451325|5.0|This is a very good book. It starts off strong and stays that way. Hard to put down. before you know it youve read fifty pages. It has a very good plot and is and overall great book
0679745203|5.0|I didn't think anything could top the movie but this did. It is a pleasure to read and interesting to see the changes from the page to the screen...
B000002AS3|5.0|a few things:<br />1. the beatles are my favorite band ever.<BR>2. this does not sound like the beatles. people who say it  mimics them or trys to imitate them are just lazy reviewers. noel does steal his fair share past brit rockers though.<BR>3.it's up there for me with van halen I and appetite with destruction as the best debut's ever. it's just pure rock n' roll with great vocals and loud guitars. <BR>4. this is oasis' best album. the vocals are better in morning glory and the songs are more mainstream but this one is jamming.
0316666343|2.0|I am impressed that this book is so popular. It must be a reflection of the state of being in this country. I gave it to my daughter first who thought it was wierd and skimmed through it. I continued reading hoping that things would tidy up in the end and they never did. It was a stretch for me to believe all the characters and some I just couldn't. I would not recommend it.
0316666343|1.0|After hearing the touching interview on NPR and reading some of the reviews on Amazon.com, I couldn't wait to get my hands on \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" dubbed as \\"destined to become a classic\\" by one back cover pundit. I knew this was going to be a winner. \\"I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973\\" reads the second sentence, appropriately sending tingly waves of anticipation and good times down my spine.  But that's where the excitement seemed to end. The only enduring feeling from then on - from what I could actually stand to read - was nausea. Indeed I was rather irritated that the author could seriously expect us to buy all that hokey business about the all-loving, sweet and innocent but tragically aggrieved Salmon family.  It appears that this contrivance of the human spirit appealed to some readers, but I just felt violated somehow. <br />To go on, I found the story line unmoving, the language awkward and uninspired and the characters hollow and utterly unbelievable. I was hoping, PRAYING that I'd find some element of real sincerity in this book, but I was serially disappointed. The magic of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is that it has all the trappings of a classic novel, but a closer read reveals nothing more that snake oil and bunkum. You'd be better spending your money on a tootsie roll.
B00005YTFG|5.0|This movie is just...SPECTACULAR!... All of the actors and actresses are amazing, and are incredibly believable.  The plot of Moulin Rouge is that a poor writer (Christian, played wonderfully by Ewan McGregor,) has come to Paris to write about \\"truth, beauty, and which he believed above all things, love.\\"  The problem?  He's never been in love!...Luckily, Christian meets a group of Bohemians who live above him and are so impressed by his writing talents that they ask him to write a musical called \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\" for the Moulin Rouge's show.  Christian agrees, and they all go to the Moulin Rouge to see the owner, Harold Zidler, (Jim Broadbent,) about the show.  At the Moulin Rouge, Christian sees Satine (Nicole Kidman) and falls in love with her.  The only problem is that Satine has to pretend that she is in love with the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) in order for the Duke to finacially support their show.  Christian and Satine have to hide their love from the Duke.  The Duke eventually catches on, gets jealous, and tells Satine that if she stays with Christian, he will have Christian killed.  I don't want to give away any more, but I will tell you that there are lots of twists and turns, and a BIG thing that I didn't put in my review.  The acting (and singing!) in this movie are SIMPLY AMAZING!...  Ewan McGregor can sing SO WELL!!!  His voice is just beautiful.  His acting is also SUPERB, and he is totally believable.  Nicole Kidman also sizzles on screen!!!  She brings it all out - the acting, singing, dancing, crying.  Her comedic timing is also very sharp.  Nicole Kidman's acting is just...AMAZING!...Her singing is also great, and she puts alot of acting into her singing.  And all of the supporting characters (Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh, and John Leguizamo,)are wonderful, and they really make this movie work.  As for the director, Baz Luhrman, what can I say???  Baz Luhrman is SPECTACULAR!!!  I am so much in awe of him.<br />  In conclusion, if you like great acting, singing, and a great story line, you will LOVE Moulin Rouge.  Moulin Rouge is a movie which is entertaining, sad, and even a little funny at times.  (Referring to the \\"Like a Virgin\\" scene.)  SEE THIS MOVIE!...eat acting, singing, and a great story line, you will LOVE Moulin Rouge.  Moulin Rouge is a movie which is entertaining, sad, and even a little funny at times.  (Referring to the \\"Like a Virgin\\" scene.)  SEE THIS MOVIE!...
B00000JCOV|1.0|wow slipknot, i do not own this cd but please look at the album cover, 9 members that is almost enough to hate them. Then try listening to them, Corey Taylor might have some talent but doesnt use it at all. After hearing songs as wait and bleed and spit it out this band is quite possibly the worst band out there today. Why are there 9 people! Seriously 3 drummers?!?!. Why do they wear masks?!they think there so hardcore because they of this but there not. they are simply retarted. If you want good metal out there i suggest everyone buy system of a down,both of their cds.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|Lenny Kravitz is a good artist and that's why I bought his greatest hits I like Again, American Woman & Fly Away. I haven't really heard the others. It's a perfect thing to buy. If you die for Lenny Kravitz buy all his CDs. I don't really need to, because I got all of his hits except for stuff on his other CDs like \\"Dig In\\". Buy this album get his hits. OK.
B00006V9A0|5.0|You have to appreciate a groups music in order to review it. Even though Nirvana has passed, and they are not making any new songs, their old albums are still the best.
B000059XY5|5.0|This is my favorite entry in the best Batman series. Danny DeVito is good, Michael Keaton is great, but Michelle Pfiffer steals the show.<br />5 out of 5, and it's the best one so far...
006016848X|5.0|I was skeptical of this book at first, but one year I bought a 365 Page-a-day calendar with topics from this book \\"Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus\\" by John Gray, and my husband & I ended up ripping some of the pages off, turning them over & writing notes to each other like, \\"This is why I act that way, that confuses you.\\" After one year, we understood each other a great deal more, had more compassion & insight into how the other person felt during disagreements or stressful trials of life.  I highly recommend this book, and think that it is silly to diss this book for it's down-to-earth style of writing.  That is precisely what makes it an easy & fast read, and frankly--if you are having issues with your beloved, you don't want to have to stop and analyze every single sentence to see if you really \\"got\\" what the author is trying to say.  John Gray is very up-front and open about issues, and has a relaxed sense of humor that helps to de-tense a volatile subject between the sexes.<br />Do yourself & your significant other a favor, and give this a try.  I am SO glad we did!  I also recommend trying to find a Page-A-Day calendar like I did, because when you leave it in the bathroom your guy will most likely read it :) when trying to get him to read an entire book is likely impossible.<br />By the way, this calendar started a tradition of leaving love notes for each other every day, which we've done now ever since!
6300213668|5.0|And that is true... why it's Grease... and it is definantly the word! I saw the play of this, and I had to see the movie after that, and I wasn't disappointed. John Travolta steals the screen with Olivia Newton-John, and you have a happy little reviewer.<br />5 out of 5!
