B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game, when you have enough energy, anyways! :)  Good way to whittle away some time in between other tasks. It is rather fun and catchy, now who doesn't love horses!? The only reason why I didn't give this game 5 stars is it doesn't like to always load, sometimes it gets stuck on the front loading page, but when it does load, it is fun!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Do not buy coins or jewels in game because it may crash and you'll lose it all.  I've. been restarted three times.  You can connect to other players but there's no chat option.  Despite these issues it's a fun game.  The ponies are cute.  The mini games are simple yet challenging.  I enjoy it despite it's issues which may be caused by the fact that I play on a Kindle Fire.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I learned a lot more about the legend  and his circle than i knew before.  This movie was well done.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|Don't waste your time with this propaganda. This movie is a documentary about fracking in the same way that Jaws is a documentary about sharks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is really a great app.My son is autistic and he loves templerun 1 so when he saw templerun 2 he pleaded with me to get it.I'm not good on this game at all..my son kicks my butt and the enjoyment that he gets from playing this game is priceless!Lots of really cool graphics and action..I enjoy watching my son travel through the different levels of the game.Very entertaining.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like a 52-card deck, this game gives you a fair run for your money.  Sometimes you win and .......
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is really a fun app ..I only wished that I could do so good in winning on the REAL coin dozer like I do on this one..this is really a FUN app!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Wonderful series  I can not wait for the third one.  It is the kind of series as you find yourself getting to the end your  very sad.
B00846F1YW|5.0|the graphics are perfect. understanding ur tasks is easy to figure out. it makes u think.  Great game. more please
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Very good book, I had already seen the movie and followed it very close. The story line and scenery stayed true.
B0000047CX|5.0|I own the record and bought this as a gift for a music lover - especially one who is discovering the delights of jazz.  Also great traveling music.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|I love the series but the quality and ease of  accessing is no where near Netflix quality for their Season 1 Downton Abbey.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Jackson is not nearly as mature in real life as the coach he's portraying in this film, but it's nice to see that he could be one day when he calms down.  Wish there were more coach Carter's in the world...
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like the plot development which keeps me from putting the story down till the very end. The author is good at story pacing that none part of the story is slow. Furthermore, the ongoing trace of the Alex is in fabulous details and touching. However, as pointed out by others, Kevin, the bad ex, is a bad husband coming from nowhere. Development is needed to make him living. Furthermore, the final change of Jo's position didn't fully backgrounded nor serve enough function in the structure of story. In a word, good story with some plain characters.
1592407889|4.0|I liked the book, but I felt sad reading it.  It showed that you could have the most famous parents and still not have the best life.  Like so many children of famous parents you really don't know what is happening in their lives.  It's very hard to have a normal life and I think this book proves it.  It was a good book to read, I recommend it.
0345803485|2.0|Expected more about BSDM in the book to what I had heard from shows on tv talking about it and etc. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. SOLD THE BOOK IMMEDIATELY DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP AND READ AGAIN AND SOLD FOR MORE THAN I EVEN BOUGHT IT FOR. lol. GOOD OUT OF BAD I GUESS BUT WON'T BUY THE OTHER BOOKS TO DISAPPOINTED WITH BOOK ONE AND WASN'T WORTH THE MONEY AND HASSLE TO GET IT AND WAITING FOR IT!!!
0452298482|5.0|Great reminders of simple life lessons like enjoying the little moments and living by the Golden Rule.<br />A thoughtful gift idea.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Words can not describe how this book affected me. As a sophomore in high school myself I can relate to Charlie in that aspect but that's not why it's life changing. It is because of the underlying psychological aspect. It is right in your face but doesn't hit you. Charlie is such an amazing and kindred spirit. He's pure. He takes everything in stride and views it from an outside perspective. I fell in love with the words of this book. By far my favorite, then again it's the last one I read. ;)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really really really want this game but my dad said it is to much money so could you please please please lower the prices to about $2.00 or $1.29 or something around those 2 numbers?PLEASE!?PLEASE!?PLEASE!?
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Can't wait for Sunday nights... Always look forward to new episodeds and it was great to catch up on the ones I missed.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Brought back excellent memory of the movie!!!!!  Not sure if I will buy the upcoming more extended version or not.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun characters are brilliant apart from when you have to unlock<br />500 duo,s for one person any who in one word fun.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|Great remastering work by audio technicians! What a improvement compare to my old copies! I'm really impressed and satisfied with everything, including packaging!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is extremely well written, and the story is engaging from start to finish. I came to this series through the television show, which is great, but the books top even the show.<br /><br />I loved the characters in the show, and in the book as well. I love the pacing also. I recommend this book (and most likely this series) to anyone looking for a book with a strong story that doesn't apologize for it's choices.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The story was unexpected. A little slow at the beginning but what a great book once you got into it. I couldn't put it down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have Solitaire on my mobile phone, also, and play it all the time.  I like the product very much.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Same story, obvious plot devices.  If the character's weren't likable I wouldn't have finished it.  Not on my recommendation list.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy being challenged by matching the tiles.  There are many scenes for you to clear the tiles and that is why I like it.
0425252868|5.0|The author provided a surprise in the writing of this book.  As an avid reader of WWII history/memoirs, I was pleased at the steps taken in presenting a remarkable story of courage and integrity on the part of an 'enemy' pilot.  Take the time to read this book, it will definitely move you.
B0091REZMW|1.0|It seems to stick on the first scene.  I have played Garden of Time for about 2 years and have had no trouble with it.
B00AAAKJHY|5.0|7th grade 1973i bought this album for about 7 bucks... no one of my friends could get into it. but it hit me like a college boy locked inside a beer truck! i had the vinyl album, in later years  i had the CD  but thanks to my many children it was lost ... i kept looking on Amazon for the MP3 and was depressed for the longest time to only see the bootleg versions of some concerts. Last week BAM1 in my face is all the Zappa stuff. I saw another person review and claimed his 3 favorite albums of zappa, which happened to be mine also....<br /><br />1) Waka Jawaka  an eclectic mix  of style and  form. i love the slide guitar and synthesizer sounds<br />2) HOT RATS  this is like a fusion rock Willie The Pimp is so hot with sugarcane harris starting out with his hot violin and zappa kicking in for some serious guitar playing.. i also love the Sax in Gumbo Variations which is like Jazz rock<br /> 3) The Grand Wazoo... pure big band the horn section takes you on an adventure<br /><br />Dont get me wrong  i love the silly Lyrics but in these 3 albums which i bought again as MP3 had music that for almost 40 years  has resonated in my soul and when played back i could hum along and follow with great  joy...<br /><br />the digital booklet is actually a pdf file of the original album art work which seems to be a lost part of the musical experience... how many people including myself sat for hours as the albums  played repeatedly and read every little thing on the cover? More than  one i suppose... also friends would sit and listen together...  now they have their headphones... and cant hear you when you say something.<br /><br />thank you who ever  made this music happen  at amazon!
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Avoid this movie!! It's 99.99% singing and very hard to follow since it's not like other movie musicals!!  Wait for it on TV or cable in a few years time!!
B00AAAI3EA|5.0|one of my top 3 zappa albums<br /><br />hot rats and waka jawaka and grand wazzo all go together, you wont regret. mostly intrumental
B0011UGLK6|5.0|The book is very interesting and I can recommend it to my friends. Book describes an inspiring immigrant story that I can relate very well.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|this movie is great, it shows what our country went through, to gain our freedom , it shows the harshness of life at that time in our history well worth watching
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The G5 people have done it again.  This game kept me going tip the end.  Loved the graphics and have always enjoyed the search and find puzzles that take me to another problem to solve.  Good job G5.
0061148512|3.0|Book was decent at best. I just wish the author would've taken some time out to grab a THESAURUS every now & then. One can not possibly love the words \\"queer\\" & \\"smudge\\" that much.
B004I744AS|4.0|This is an easy to use app with lots of extras. WAAAAAY better than the dictionary that comes automatically with your Kindle Fire:) You wont be disappointed.
B007N85POS|5.0|I thought the original Angry Birds were OK, but I really LIKE Rio! It feels more detailed, and, as you might guess, I much prefer rescuing birds to squashing pigs. It's my favorite &#34;Birds&#34; yet, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />PS--If you aim too high, you can bounce the birds off the ceiling lights. Those kinds of little details make things fun, and the crying bird that appears when I flub a level is incentive to rescue them better. LOL
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It only takes a few min a day to keep up  w this game. Once in a while it will crash with no way to get out of it unless you completely shut down your Kindle, which is annoying. But other than that, you get lots of coins quite easily and the design is pretty neat.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wow! What can I say but I LOVE IT!  It's addicting! Love to see all the different things I am interested in and see what others have done too.
B0063IH60K|3.0|If you like solitaire, then you'll like this app. Its a time waster if you're bored. You can choose pics of your own for the back of the cards which is kinda cool.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this! It makes your daily Bible reading so easy. I love the way it keeps up with your daily reading and checks it off for you.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Did not even know this was a series until a friend recommended that my wife would like it....unbelievably, I got hooked on the show.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie was well worth the money!!  It provided lots of laughs for my entire family. Would have been nice if the mailing facility in Pa would have shipped the movie out on time though. We had to wait 4 extra days for it to arrive.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|really cute! my 3 year old loves it! she is able to feed the horse and pet it. it is better than going to the stables
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Thank you Tim Ferris for writing such an interesting and user friendly cook book.  Your life hacking skills have improved my cooking and added some lively, productive conversations at my dinner table.<br />I am a busy mom, educator, eclectic reader of magazines, and aspiring cook.  With two middle school age sons I don't have time to make meals that involve extensive preparation and execution or read lengthy books unless I feel they will greatly enhance my life in some way.  The 4 Hour Chef has been the one book so far this year that has met the criteria for life enhancement.  My sons love when I read The 4 Hour Chef because they feel the \\"Black book\\" has made me a much better cook.  Both boys want the recipe/method for Sexy-Time Steak because it was so good and just in case they have a date in college (made me laugh).  I will definitely buy the each a copy before they leave home as part of their college survival skills toolbox.<br />I feel The 4 Hour Chef is a book we will continue to refer back to for cooking ideas and guidance.<br />The only issue I had was the size of the actual book.  It's very large and bulky which makes it heavy and awkward to tote around outside the house.  I purchased an electronic  copy of The 4 Hour Chef and have found I like having this particular book in both forms.  Owning the same book in hard copy and electronic form may seem excessive to some people but I have found it very convenient for my lifestyle.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Interesting story-very timely. China is in the news using &#34;hacking&#34; to attack our systems. Hopefully the story that Clancy has written never happens to the US.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Why is it that we fail to learn more about our parents and family history until it's too late - or almost too late?!!  Kate Morton does an excellent job of bringing WWII London to life while bridging to the present time.  The twists and turns in this novel kept me involved until the very end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best one of the series!! Will have you on the edge of your seat through the whole book!! Great Read!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is an awesome movie from start to finish, it's teaches about fatherhood, and men standing up to their responsibility as men, being examples.. This is a must see!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great puzzle game.  Keeps my mind sharp and entertains me for hours. I love that it has so many levels.  I highly recommend it!  Runs smoothly on Samsung tablet.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book was hard for me to put down.  I enjoyed the story line but was so sad that she wanted to end her life and his tremendous love for her.  I can understand why she wanted to die but she was also selfish to only think of herself.
B00000ICD9|5.0|I watched this movie with my husband. It prompted discussions about us being soul mates. This is a must see movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app. I think you should buy the app. Super fun mini games.<br /><br />I could play this all day. I can not believe it is free.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I found this slow going at first but then found myself totally absorbed.  This takes you to a location somewhere in your head you visit only in erotic dreams.

1616551100|4.0|Outside of Baskerville Hall, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Midnight. It is dark and gloomy, and we witness the death of Sir Hugo Baskerville. The fluorescent frame around the monstrous hound and its glowing red eyes are the only splash of colour in the first pages of the graphic novel of The Hound of the Baskervilles by Jamie Chase (artist) and Martin Powell (author). The generally dark and mysterious quality of the book immediately conveys that we reading a gothic mystery novel, underlined by the sparse use of colour which stands in stark contrast to the black and grey of the greater part of the images. The gothic feeling which Doyle created in the descriptions of the settings of his novel is perfectly reflected in the colour palette of the images. The style is somewhat atypical for graphic novels and a mix of different modes adds to the postmodern feel of this old story. In addition, the use of colour, especially of red and white, becomes highly symbolic. Especially the drawings of Holmes and Watson are very interesting. Their portrayal is not entirely fixed because of the rough brush strokes of the drawings. There are glimpses of unique and new characteristics of the two protagonists, commonly established images and props and similarities which evoke memories of the different actors who have portrayed the detective and his side-kick over the years.<br /><br />The graphic novel follows the narrative of Doyle's original story closely and dialogue is used wisely in order to keep the coherence without being overbearing; upholding a lovely balance between text and images. Most importantly, the book presents a condensed version of The Hound of the Baskervilles without losing its intelligence or mystery.<br /><br />It is easy to read and will both be a treat to fans of the story and a great abridged version of The Hound of the Baskervilles for those who have not yet read it. The fantastic bonus of this version of the story is of course that even if you know the plot, you now have the art to enjoy as well and discover details and artistic references which are the forte of the genre.the art to enjoy as well and discover details and artistic references which are the forte of the genre.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I started watching this with my Grandma when I was little and have wanted to buy it ever since.  Great, fun, and entertaining.  I love this movie.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I could not put this book down.  When I was forced to put it down and go about my daily life I could not stop thinking about it.  So good!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|Very interesting story, but long, long, long. Lots of intrigue. The story will evoke a lot of different emotions. I looked up a lot of words that I'd never seen before, only to find they weren't really words. The author must have made them up. You can figure out the meaning from the context most of the time. Basically, it was an okay book. If you have a lot of time, and like extremely detailed, descriptive writing, you'll enjoy this book.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|While not exactly factually accurate, it was fairly close and the story was great. I am not a fan of affleck, but he did a good job on this.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game more than the original one. it is a lot more challenging and fun. but I do have to say that the giant monkey is a little creepy. I advise anyone who is looking at this app should get it.

1118232658|5.0|This book is not another \\"how to\\" guide for social media. I, like many of us, have read those books and became frustrated with their one-size fits all methodology, and outdated statistics. To be frank, I had almost given up on finding a book that could remain relevant long enough to be published. Qualman succeeds with the second edition of Socialnomics. Erik weaves insight with statistics, and concise case studies to show the reader how organizations have succeeded, and continue to succeed, in the \\"World of Mouth(tm).\\"<br /><br />If you are in search of a \\"ten easy steps\\" or \\"social media made simple\\" guide, you are looking in the wrong place. Qualman describes a world where products and services discover customers in an ever-changing global marketplace. His case studies and insight inspire the reader to discover their own unique place in this landscape of opportunities. While examples are provided, and techniques are discussed, the details of implementation are up to the reader. Rather than providing explanations on how to blog or post, Erik describes why you should want to, and what your stakeholders are looking for in the first place.<br /><br />Qualman describes a social topography, irrespective of age or gender, just waiting for your organization to create a conversation. Unlike other authors, Erik understands that the best-intentioned managers still have to answer to someone asking the cost questions. Socialnomics hosts several examples of techniques and future trends that will lower marketing costs, as well as increase brand awareness and impact.<br /><br />The organization of the book is unique and to a purpose. This work is designed as a reference tool; Erik explains that each chapter is designed to stand-alone. The reader has the freedom to skip from chapter to chapter without worrying about losing the thread. The table of contents and the summary should be read first, after that; the reader can interact with the material as they choose. Socialnomics represents a thoughtful and attentive attempt at grappling with an ever-changing social phenomenon. The reader can expect a cogent and concise response from Qualman for many of their social media queries.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was brilliant  it gets 5 stars  I am just so sad that this is the end of the hunger games books
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King and this is one of his best! I was only 11 days old when JFK was killed but this book makes you feel like you were right there back in 1963.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this app is just amazing. It is so addicting and great for the kindle fire. I have this app on my kindle fire and iPod touch, and I just love this app. It's great to play and really great for passing time. It's worth your money and time, completely recommended.

B007PFD90G|3.0|Starts very well, but eventually you get tired: the author is really too self-centered  Well worth purchasing for the first half.
0061714372|5.0|Just Awesome, It has hardcover a very good book a have alredy ready it. If you are a really big fan you should buy It.
0452295548|5.0|I had read this book some time ago and recommended/loaned it several others.  The last &#34;borrower&#34; did not return it so I had to purchase another book.  I want to ensure I always have a copy in my library!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app I played it on my brothers kindle and I could not stop playing it that was how much I love so I want u to get it if u do not then u r just weird
B0012HEB32|5.0|While there is a lot of fun shoot 'em up, the writing is surprisingly good and the acting is -quite- good.  These are not your 2D comic book heroes.  The characters have inner conflict that surfaces and is portrayed with a surprising range of emotion.  A good ensemble cast.<br /><br />Too bad the series was canceled after two seasons.  The second season was much stronger than the first, and the show finale set the stage for a whole host of interesting and new directions.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|works well once you figure out the finer points altho still have not figured out how to use it solo, requires two to get great cuts for me at this point.  i  strongly suggest watching the youtube videos showing how to use it before starting.<br /><br />its important to wipe and oil the blade between each cut for best results.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has fancy graphics and is more fun with the more advanced features. I specifically like the jewels and save me!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend. So far it has been more of a present for me! I have had him sharpen most of my kitchen knives so that I can actually cut things. It's easy to use and does the job quickly. It puts a pretty nice edge on the blades with only a few passes...even blades that have been pitted from misuse and trips through the dishwasher.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book to read from beginning to end. I had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait to start the next one.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This is as beautiful and amazing as the reviews I've read have claimed. It definitely isn't for the gamer looking for a fast-paced, action-packed game though. If you're looking for character development, story, and action, go somewhere else. It does help you relax and almost meditate though. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the music is integrated into the game play very well. The only thing that was a little difficult was getting used to tilting the controller to move things. I was definitely not disappointed.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The journey of two lonely people searching for more and finding what they needed.  The orphanage passages were difficult to read. But in spite of so many heartbreaking experiences faith in God and people survive.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I found a lot of the information in this book to be pretty useful and enlightening. I decided to drop wheat/gluten from my diet and sure enough, many of the symptoms he discusses got much better. I tend to be very skeptical, but I can't argue too much with results after years of going to the doctor for help and not finding it. He is very redundant in the presentation of the information. You could probably get the Cliff's Notes version and not be missing too much.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|Terry has done an excellent job with this book, pictures look amazing! and i just love Lady Gaga and Terry's work, so this book is a wonderful piece of my photographer/Little Monster Collection!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|We had missed the entire series but kept hearing how wonderful it was, so decided to give it a try.  Well, we are hooked!  The acting and storyline are wonderful!  I love looking at the clothes of the period and seeing the manners that were used is absolutely amazing since we are lacking in so many social manners these days.  At this point, we have only seen seasons 1 & 2, so we are very anxious to see season 3.<br /><br />I would highly recommend starting from the first episode, if you have not seen any, so you know the characters and how they evolve in the storyline.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The book was expensive to buy but it was a great read never the less. The characters were believable and likable.

B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I loved this book and wanted it to go on and on and never stop. It related an episode in history which I had no knowledge of and was set in place of which I knew nothing about. The 'letter' style was unusual at first but became less so as the book progressed and the letters became longer. It made me want to go to Guernsey and give all these lovely characters a big warm hug.
6305428042|3.0|i used to watch this movie when i was little and loved it but wow when your intellect changes so does the movie its still good but not the same. my kids really like it so i guess that would make it a timeless classic? or is that too much credit
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks delivers again!  One of the best books I have ever read in my whole life! The characters were fantastically written, I purchased the book Friday night and by Saturday mid-morning I was finished! I could not put it down!  I can't wait to see the movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|first I loved subway surfers until I saw my friend playing temple run 2 on the bus. I went home and downloaded it on my kindle fire. Now I am addicted to it. If you get it I do suggest you get it for a tablet. It is harder on a small screen.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|Always liked this movie and was excited to see that it was be re-released in 3D BluRay.  Well it is 3D, but the quality is horrible.  The picture in some spots looks like VHS.  The picture in the best spots looks no better than DVD.<br /><br />I'm learning that I shouldn't spend good money to upgrade DVD films to 3D or Blu Ray.

B0000YEEHG|5.0|What remains to be said about this wondrous, haunting film? From its opening montage of dreamlike images, mixing the luminous with the nightmarish, it draws the viewer into the private yet universal world of the human psyche. The story is simplicity itself: actress Elizabeth Vogler has chosen to be mute, unwilling to speak another word, and nurse Alma has come to care for her on a lonely island. But that bare-boned storyline yields an astonishing richness & mystery for the enrapt viewer, who is drawn into these two lives & their nakedly intimate entanglement.<br /><br />Or is it just one life?<br /><br />Among the pleasures of this film are the ways it can be interpreted. Are Elizabeth & Alma two aspects of the same woman? Are they two women, each one lacking what the other possesses? Is this a sexual seduction in progress? Or is it something much deeper, reaching down to the very roots of individual being?<br /><br />As to the sexual aspect, Bergman demonstrates how the imagination is the most erotic part of being human, as Alma relates a youthful sexual adventure to Elizabeth. All we hear are her words, all we see are the women's faces ... but this sequence remains one of the most vividly powerful scenes of intense sexuality ever put on the movie screen. What our minds see & make our bodies feel is so much more erotic than any mere, blatantly graphic image could hope to be.<br /><br />Yet that's only one aspect of the film, and hardly its most revealing one. What interests Bergman even more is the complicated, infinitely intertwining knot that is human desire, longing, and despair, searching for some resolution or illumination. What he offers here is not so much a definite answer as it is immediate experience for the viewer, who is left to respond & pursue the same questions. It's a film that invites multiple viewings, both for those perpetual questions & for its sheer beauty, thanks to the breathtaking black-&-white cinematography. Bergman has long had the reputation of being an intellectual filmmaker; I often think his eye for stunning beauty & poetic composition is neglected because of it. The film is an aesthetic marvel as well as an intellectual one!<br /><br />For some, of course, all of this is just pretentious gobbledygook posing as transcendent depth. Certainly it won't appeal to everyone. And I'm sure Bergman's solemn reputation is off-putting to some potential viewers as well. But if you can set that aside & simply give yourself over to the film, you're likely to find yourself enthralled with it before long. And it will stay with you afterwards. Most highly recommended!tion of being an intellectual filmmaker; I often think his eye for stunning beauty & poetic composition is neglected because of it.

B00BHMETKC|4.0|I thought the movie was well acted and directed, and very entertaining.  But is it worth all of the Oscar buzz it's getting?  I would say No.  It's very good, but not great.  I'd nevertheless highly recommend watching it.

0525950079|3.0|I got this book because I loved Pillars of the Earth.  I loved it so much that I have already gone through 2 copies since I have read it over and over again.  Touted as the sequel to Pillars of the Earth, this book just misses the mark.  It was a struggle to get through and though the story line was OK, I never even finished the book.  In order to know the rest of the story, I watched the miniseries on Netflix, which was MUCH better.

1400067820|4.0|The latest offering from Taleb is just what you would expect.  You ride along with his stream of consciousness style as he attempts to weave personal stories, classical mythology and sometimes even genuine insight into the book. He claims that Antifragile is the manifesto of his philosophy and worldview that he previously explored in Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness.  Taleb's main point about volatility and how it affects certain things differently is an interesting read for a good portion of the book.  As Taleb starts painting with a bigger and bigger brush, applying his philosophy to a wide range of topics he starts to lose the reader. An healthy editing of the work would have left me with less mixed feelings about the topic and author.  Taleb repeats (and repeats) his main proclamation about volatility until the horse is very much dead.  His ego being fully on display and his quirks of writing are at times are enjoyable for the reader but it does detract from the message.  You end up willing to follow Taleb, wanting to hear more about his proclamations of antifragility yet unwilling to jump off the cliff of logic with him at the end.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Russell Crowe was excellent in this movie.  He can look like any type of character with such ease.  Russell is one of the finest actors living today.  I found the movie very entertaining and well done.

B0030FUALQ|5.0|Hi, I just want to add a quick note to those who might be wondering if these cds are all \\"remasters.\\" I found that if a specific album in the set has been remastered, then you'll get that in these boxes. For the boxset of Caravanserai, Love Devotion & Surrender, Welcome, Borboletta, and Amgios, the remasters would be Caravanserai, Love Devotion & Surrender, and Welcome. For Borboletta and Amigos you get the same sound as the 2008 Sony SBME Special Markets cds, which I think still sounds great. Now you may be saying, wait Amigos and Borboletta have been remastered, right but only in Japan. Unfortunately you don't get those versions in these EU Import sets, or else they would be a HUGE value!<br /><br />I A/B'd this set with my Sony Legacy remasters of Caravenserai, Love Devotion & Surrender, and Welcome, and they were the same sound. I A/B'd Amigos and Borboletta with my Sony SBME special markets 2008 reissues, and they too were identical. This was in a JBL car audio system. I too am into the remasters and collect Japan mini-lps, but the SBME special markets of the two in this set do sound great. You can crank it up and it's not too loud, and it's not too weak either.<br /><br />Here's an update for the other boxes in the Santana series. For the box of Inner Secrets, Marathon, Zebop, Shango, and Freedom you will get the regular nonremastered Sony BMG reissues. Marathon, Zebop, and Shango have been remastered by Friday Music in the USA but those versions are not in this classic series set. Inner Secrets will have the 12\\" disco mix of \\"One Chain.\\" To get the LP mix of \\"One Chain,\\" you have to buy the Inner Secrets 2010 Japanese minilp DSD remaster (SICP-2875).<br /><br />For the boxset of Illuminations, Oneness, and Swing of Delight, you once again get the regular nonremastered Sony BMG reissues. Swing of Delight has been remastered by Friday Music in the USA (not the version in this classic series).<br /><br />Finally for the set of Havana Moon, Beyond Appearances, and Spirits Dancing In The Flesh, you get the regular nonremastered Sony BMG reissues. All in all a great value for around 10 bucks!
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|Russell Crowe is my favorite actor in any role.  This is a very different part for him.  I am sure he had great fun making this movie.  He sits a horse very well in any era.  He is one of the great actors of our time.
B001BANK32|5.0|I saw the movie when it first came out, but I had never read the book. I was surprised by how well-written and literary the writing was. It was decently paced, and the tension built to the end. A very enjoyable read (vastly superior to Salem's Lot).<br /><br />There is certainly the scary stuff, but it is not up in your face until about three-quarters of the way through. To a large extent, it is a statement of the modern family, how domestic violence permeates society and affects us as we grow up with it. It deals with matters of addiction and selfishness, and other things. It contains subtlety, nuance, and metaphor. Well worth the read, even if you think of yourself as only a reader of literary fiction.
0345505387|5.0|Gabaldon writes great material.  Jamie Fraser and all the characters associated with his family are interesting.  She is an excellent writer who keeps you wanting to turn the next page.
0956010903|5.0|I bought this book almost 4 years ago, it was a present to my girlfriend (now my wife) whom is a great fan of the Potter saga.<br /><br />Previously she had the normal version of this book, but as I knew she loves the work of J.K. Rowlling, I decided to buy this one.<br /><br />It was the perfect present to her; perhaps a little overpriced, for being an article of the fashion saga of the moment, in the other hand, all the details and finishes in the materials may worth the price.
B001C48EGK|5.0|Russell Crowe made this movie believable.  I am certain in real life there are many stories such as this one.  The intrique within the government makes the thriller exciting.  The street scenes were very real.  The screen with big brother watching is daunting.  It is a very good film.
1616550414|5.0|This book is the perfect enciclopedia from The Legend of Zelda saga, and is written by Shigeru Miyamoto so we can totally sure that the information we find in it is totally true and official.<br /><br />The book is a little bigger than I thought, but this is better, because even the small images look crisp. Hyrule Historia contains everything a Zelda fan may wish, every part of the story is well explained and documented with images.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone who is fan of the saga, to every nintendo fan, and to everybody who admire the work of Mr. Miyamoto.<br /><br />There's no words that may express how happy I am with this excellent book, its great finishing and lots of information.

B00AOCLWF6|4.0|This is a good and on the verge of great series, but you should watch it from the begining and give it a couple of episodes to see if you like it.
B004Q9T4E4|2.0|At the beginning, this well writen text captures our attention. Later on, one notes that there are too many generalizations, too many comparisons between non-comparable things and, specially, a complete lack of method.<br />In the first, and good, chapter, the author says he is going to follow the methodology of historical interpretation laid by the late professor R. G. Collingwood, which is basically assess early societies with a set of values different from that of our times. This means that you cannot assess Romans or early Egyptians by their \\"entrepeneurship\\" in the way the word is used today.<br />But \\"Lo!\\": soon after this very civilized methodological assumption, he carries on evaluating civilizations and societies throroughout history in terms of \\"killer applications\\" the West developed and the Rest failed to 'download'.<br />Maybe this kind of chaotic discourse functions finely on the TV, the medium from which this book comes from. But books are another thing, they are slow, thoughtful, prone to thinking rather than light entertainment.<br />So, if you insist in being acquainted with Niall Ferguson's very feeble musings, at least choose the TV: it is faster to peruse and cheaper than a book.

B00BETX5PS|5.0|Quite entertaining, even if one had not seen any Bond movies before. It stands on its on while carrying on the basic theme of previous Bond movies - suspense, intrigue, and action - in reasonable proportions. It is not as intense and riveting as some thriller action-graphics movies of recent years. So site back, relax, and enjoy an entertaining movie that has a decent story with theme and continuity with a hint of the past and future.

1607066017|5.0|There's something to be said for a good love story. What makes this even better is that the main characters are from opposite sides of a bloody conflict. It begins with the birth of their child and subsequent escape(s) from the war, and those that would chase them down. The writing never gets in the way of the story or the characters and Fiona Staples artwork is expressive and inviting. There is an underlying weirdness to the book that makes it feel like some newly discovered fable. I am so glad I took a chance on this book and look forward to subsequent volumes.

I hope Jeff Kinney will keep writing these AWESOME books!!
B0043CSBKM|1.0|I was not aware that this Blu Ray was only in Italian and Japanese.  To be honest, Italian is listed as the language in the product details section of the listing.  However, there are also reviews raving about the English dub on the same page.  Presumably these are for other vendors who are actually selling the English version.<br /><br />In any case, either the vendor or Amazon should really do something to clean up this listing.  It is clearly misleading.  Just something like &#34;Akira [Italian version]&#34; is all it would take for the listing title.  I really don't think that's unreasonable.<br /><br />Two weeks after I returned the Blu Ray and still have not gotten a refund.  I cannot recommend this vendor, but at least I've learned a lesson about paying closer attention to product listings.

I was completely spellbound how the character would be walking or in the middle of doing something and would suddenly be in another world. and the vivid words that helped to bring you right in the book to be walking right with Him.

It's complex enough to hold her interest for a long enough time to allow me to get stuff done.<br /><br />She has not yet made it all the way through the maze, nor has her 19-year-old brother. This makes me happy, because the challenge is still there.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|It´s unbelievable that this is from the same guy who brought us Hatchet (make no mistake, I liked that one too), but it´s totally different in tone and style. So if you think this is Hatchet on a ski lift, stay clear of this one, because it is not. It is a well shot and well acted drama of survival of three friends and it leaves you in tears after some of the more harrowing and heart tearing sequences ever filmed for a genre picture. Two thumbs up for the young cast who delivered a stunning and emotional moving performance until the bitter end. So if you´re a fan of drama and survival horror join in and have a blast.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I went into this hoping for a fresh Bond film.  I got a rehashed and oh not so good version of the Dark Knight.  Hero disappears for 7 years, returns to find all his goodies sold at auction but must still do good.  He has to go after a cyberterrorist and stop him from destroying the internation cyber grid.<br /><br />When I was but knee high to a grasshopper, James Bond rarely got hurt, he walked out of destructions in an unrumpled tux or suit, to ask for a martini and finds the woman the rest of us women envy.  In this he is (SPOLIER) shot in the first sequence, and disappears into a third world country where he gets hooked on pain killers.  This in not the James bond I know.<br /><br />I would watch Judi Dench do a round up of Southpark's worst moments.  She (spoiler) was the best M we have ever had until they decide to kill her in the fight with the big bad.  The big bad?  Does he want world domination?  Domination of the media?  All the gold in the world?  Something huge andscary?  Uh, no. (SPOILER)  He wants revenge on M, kinda.<br /><br />Appararently I am so no a film know it all because I still don't see why everyone squaks that Daniel Craig is the best Bond.  Frankly he lacks the humor and the joy of living that Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan had.  And Roger Moore had more sex appeal.<br /><br />(SPOILER)  I don't understand why you blow up the entire staff of MI-6 including John Cleese unless you want a complete reboot to fit your strange new interpretation.  I don't get that the only gadgets we see are a (Spoiler) gun that reads Bond's palm print before it can fire and a itty bitty radio, oh and the 60's Astin Martin (spoiler) which they shoot up.  Insert extreme sorrow.  That car was the best thing next to Albert Finney's wonderful performance as the Scottish groundskeeper.<br /><br />The film also feels like they took a bunch of other films, Dark Knight, Source Code, War Games and put the in a blender to get the plot.<br /><br />I am as disappointed in this film, almost as much as I was the first time I saw Timothy Dalton as Bond, and we all know how that turned out.  The writers, the directors, the producers and Goddess help us Daniel Craig has to find senses of humor, of lightness and of joy.<br /><br />Frankly, I am leaving James Bond for the far sexier Jason Bourne and Aaron Cross.

B00005JLKN|4.0|Again a surprise on the director´s part. Who would have thought that Brett Ratner could pull of such a stunt, but then, what can go wrong with an all star cast as in this movie. Anthony Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter and Ed Norton is in a whole different leauge as an actor as is Manhunter´s Will Petersen. The other problem the old film had was the clinical and cold directing style of Michael Mann. This film felt gritty, dirty, brutal and Ralph Fiennes is always a great villain. So if you haven´t seen Manhunter skip it and go straight to this one, you can watch the old movie to compare it to the new one, but if you want to see the real thing go to Red Dragon.
B005LAII0S|3.0|Tarsem Singh knows how to give us a gorgeous film. And the set design, costume design (the last film work of visionary Eiko Ishioka), cinematography, all make this a visual feast for the eyes. The script, though very witty and smart, ends up with a rather predictable plot. What made me continue to watch was the production values and the cocktail party way in which the film plays with our expectations of the classic \\"Snow White and Seven Dwarves\\" tale, making fun of the original, with other retellings, and a film version. Fortunately, the film doesn't very often parody itself, so it remains true unto its own world. There are tons of puns and jokes and reverse twists that remind me of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, and I'm sure the filmmakers were well versed in the Rob Reiner classic.<br /><br />Entertaining to the very end, the credits begin with a Bollywood-style music video that would make me buy the BD ... if only they'd included the production number as a full-screen extra as many other films do. But no, the disc gives us other things we probably don't need.<br /><br />The BD is gorgeous, and the film lively and diverting (probably not for younger kids; Julia Roberts had her kids escorted from the set during shots so they weren't exposed to the dialog), I just wish we had that marvelous music video.
B001HN697M|3.0|I was always asking myself if a prequel to the Underworld franchise was absolutely necessary. We saw already the fate of Victor´s daughter and her story with Lucian in flashbacks, so why make a film about it. After these opening words you ask yourself, dear reader, why three stars. I can tell you why: I´m a big creature movie fan and this film has plenty of those and I do have a soft spot for vereything that is set in medieval times and I´m a big fan of Patrick Tatopoulos work. So if you´re like me you will dig the film, otherwise leave it alone.

B003Q6D27S|3.0|I hope I speak for every Saw fan when I say that for the Final Chapter I would have envisioned something else and bigger than this. I thought that the series would go out with a big bang, instead we saw just another one (you had the feeling that this is Part 15 of the series, with all it´s charm and oroginality gone out of the window). The opening sequence was quite funny as were all the other deaths in this (and in every entry) but for the big finale we would have expected something different.

B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews, but I must say, in the past few years I have spent a lot of time shaping my library of music. That being said, I never really paid much attention to the Black Veil Brides before, but a friend recommended this album to me. So, before buying it, I decided to listen to it on Spotify. As soon as I heard the opening track, \\"I Am Bulletproof\\", I was impressed by every aspect of this album. But it doesn't stop there, the album keeps getting better and better. The guitar work is top-notch, as are the vocals done by Andy Biersack, and so is the fact that it is a concept album. Some standout tracks are \\"I Am Bulletproof\\", \\"New Years Day\\", \\"Devil's Choir\\", \\"Overture\\", \\"Shadows Die\\", and \\"In The End\\".<br /><br />If you like modern rock music that is good, then BUY THIS ALBUM!
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|Quickly bored. Sorry, nice idea and I'm sure it appeals to many but not me. Too repetative for mucho fun.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie is fantastic, it was a great way to end the Dark Knight Trilogy and it,. I hope they make more.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Its a nice enough game to kill a little time whilst I'm waiting on something but I don't have enough time to read but it dosen't grab me like say patchworkz did.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love the great puzzles and the skill levels. Just wish their was a way to keep my purchases. Every time I get a new device all my old puzzles go away and I have to repurchase. I've contacted the maker a couple of times and they've not responded.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Whats not to love for a bit of escapism. If you like dramas or soaps then watch this and see how good they can be. Real actors in a real setting. No shouting insipid lines at other wooden performers.
B000PY6BBI|3.0|I like the cast, the acting, the plot, but this film has one of the worst scores. It's so bad that it's distracting in some scenes. Ladyhawke could have been more memorable (and less dated) if it had been scored to suit the story and setting. I would have given it four stars were it not for the Alan Parsons' 80's synth-pop.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I love Jane Austen and wasn't disappointed in this adaptation. This DVD has a very good quality of picture and sound.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Even if you think you won't or don't like Opera, you will love this selection.  Opera is a good thing!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The BBC adaptations of the British literature classics are always excellent and this one is no exception. Everything is perfect about it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's a fun game, having a bit of a problem learning how to play it.  I'm sure I'll do better with more practice.
B004XISI4A|4.0|It can get a little tedious but if you are a devoted Game of thrones of course it is a must read. It seems so tough to have to wait for the next book to see what is happening
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|Still trying to figure out how to play the game.  I wish the instructions were clearer on how to play.
B001DHXT20|3.0|Stark shows up and tells the general that they're putting a team together and at that point I now get that that team is The Avengers movie that plays into that one but if the Hulk is in another country after he defeated that other monster at the end of the Hulk when the Hulk jumped off the building and into the sky then why didn't they portray that tie in into the Avengers movie, after I saw the Avengers movie it didn't make that much sense because the Hulk was in with the team and the storyline sort of fell apart. So are they planning another Hulk movie to explain his further exploits after that point and is Ed Norton going to reprise his role in it? The incredible Hulk didn't have that much of a role in the Avengers movie.<br /><br />This is why I give this only 3 stars.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I have heard so much about this game.  Easy to learn.  It will keep me busy while waiting for appointments.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This was a fun one but it could be longer. Just when youare getting into the game, it comes to an end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a good game to play when I can because I like these games and it is free to play and it is easy to get stuff
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I've been using these headphones for about a year and a half in my home recording studio and they have been simply AMAZING. They have a big, rich sound with a deep deep. For the price they have a pretty good &#34;neutral&#34; sound to do mixing. The grills are comfortable enough that I can stay in my studio all night and practically forget that I'm wearing these. For the quality and the price, these are great for musicians or recording artists without busting your wallet.<br /><br />If performance wasn't good enough... their warranty is! These babies come with a 2-year warranty and I got to test this out recently when the left speaker suddenly quit working. I sent it out for warranty repair and received it 3 weeks later... good as new! They had replaced certain parts and reassembled the body. Now THAT'S a company that stands behind their products!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The adapter that came with my son's Kindle Fire was only a regular wall plug and soon stopped working.<br />I called Amazon Support and they sent me this cable and adapter: No more problems!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon Support!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|past the time away playing this fun game, if you want a great game to the it is worth the money.
B008D1LVRY|4.0|Just down to earth heavy metal southern rock!!!! Get it well worth it. Just as good as the first one
B001UGB1X8|4.0|We wish that this film had been released in our market. I am sure that we would have enjoyed it even more on the big screen.  I found it to be it well cast, and  filmed. Highly recommend.
B00956UPSW|5.0|So glad that I got it. Down is such a great band with a great sound.<br />Just wish it was a little longer, but hey I am not complaining .
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|It does exactly what it says it will. It is a lightweight case, it does a good job of protecting the screen, easy to use. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is that when you fold the cover to make a stand it is a bit flimsy and will fall down if nudged.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for over a decade. It's charming and funny and an easy distraction from almost anything you're trying to get away from. Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant are cinematic gold.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I just LOVE Emeli and what she stands for. Her music has a feel that we can all relate to. This album will not let you down, I promise. Her vocals are AMAZING.<br /><br />Also, this came quite quickly, nicely packaged.<br /><br />:)
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I LOVE this movie! It's superb. It's one of my all time favorites. The way they brought this old tale into today's animation is charming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It a great game. But it takes a lot of skill to play it. Overall it would be a great game for people 5 years to how ever old you are. I love this game and you might
B00422LESO|2.0|The story is mostly fun, but Jane Hayes (the lead character) seems to spend more time emotionally fighting against accepting the playing of her role at Pembrook Park (Austenland) rather than enjoying the purpose of her vacation.  I expect the movie to be better than the book all though they will probably make the movie racier than the book, especially the scenes with the gardener.  I was not impressed with the ending which seemed hurried and flat.  I ordered the Kindle edition of Austenland the day I heard it was being made into a movie (about a month ago) and I got it for $1.99.  Just noticed this week the Kindle price is now $9.68, so I guess there is speculation that the movie will bring sales to the book.
B000VZIOCK|5.0|By far their best. Josh Homme is at his best in this record. With Dave Grohl on drums you can't go wrong. 5 out of 5.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book sucked!  Did not like the flow of it, the characters, or the story line.  It had too many stories going on and could become complicated for someone who doesn't read much. It started really slow, i had to read the 6 first chapters before it even grasped my attention. Then as I continued reading, I just had to skip to the last 3 chapters because the book became so predictable that I didn't need to read anymore.  I would probably never read another book from this author.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson wrapped it up nicely.<br /> If there is one thing Sanderson does well its climactic scenes and this book was full of them.<br /><br />It's funny to say this after the slowness of the series (6-9 in particular) but I think this book would have benefited from another 500 pages.
B00957T6X6|5.0|5 stars for this guy!  The storyline is as complex as the characters.  Martin's vivid imagery keeps me turning pages.  Enjoy!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|You seriously can't do better for your Android phone, as far as keyboards go. This is both a predictive, correcting keyboard, but you can also draw your words without leaving the screen, as you draw out the word, it also predicts it for you, and the more you use it, the smarter it gets. All that and it comes with themes to change the way your keyboard looks, to match your taste, from silver to pink to black themes.
B00701L5XS|4.0|Wish there was a button to show the process over again. Hard to catch it the first time. Other than that, a good app.
B003K16P3M|4.0|An awesome book! I have fallen in love with a new author!<br />Katsa is a fascinating character to get to know.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|well conceived, fascinating, beautifully edited story of a man who lived his life unaware of the influence his music had on a major political upheaval in the world.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really liked it and so does my brother. One time my brother stole my Kindle to read this book. I highly recommend this book for kids who like chapter books.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|Best Mario bros rip off I've played. Has a very fun 80's nes throw back feel. Smooth game play and the tablet controlles aren't bad!
B00328G4XY|4.0|Of course you have a classic cd , but I was let down to find the DVD which lists I believe five or six songs, one would assume you would<br />see the master play at least one of those songs ,live,and in it's entirety. Not one song is performed by Jimi on this DVD but merely talked about by Eddie Kramer. A bit disappointing.<br /><br />  Always Sincere,<br />  MUSICPIMP
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Ich nutze es auf dem Kindle fire und dort läuft das Programm super ohne Probleme und gibt super genaue und richtige Angaben<br /><br />Umbedingt lassen werde mir jetzt die vollVersion holen nicht will es nötig ist sondern weil ich die App super finde und den Hersteller damit unterstützen möchte
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Loved the songs in the movie and now i can enjoy them on the go whenever i want! This album is a must have
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this app because u can get people to play with you. And the best part is u get to draw!!
B008ROH07W|5.0|great cd amazing artist will get more of her works alison balsom is one of my favorite players just great
034580404X|5.0|The books are great and the price is awesome!!!! I'm a very happy customer and I think I got a great deal!
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game. It get gradually more challenging but is not impossible. Addictive. Sometime frustrating but if it was too easy it would be boring.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I totally absolutely love this book I have watched all the shows and normally hate to read but I have to say.........THE BOOK IS WAYYYY BETTER THAN THE SHOW!!!!!!!#
B006O3MU96|3.0|This is one of those games that restarts every time you die. You can't make any progress you always start at the beginning trying to see how much farther you can get. I can do this about once or twice a day. Otherwise it just drives me nuts that I get so far and still have to start at the beginning again. Its cute though and fun when I do play it.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|If you are sitting on the fence about whether or not to buy this set, get ready to be pushed over to the \\"buy\\" side. The wife and I wavered over this for a while, but with a price of around $2 per CD, we decided to take the plunge. Part of the reason for our wavering was we weren't exactly sure which original albums we would get, as Amazon did not provide a track list and the CDs were not available to download.<br /><br />Well, we are very glad we bought this set. You get the original Philips recordings, most of which are rare and hard to get, and some even have bonus tracks from the same conductor's other albums. Each CD is stored in the jacket of original artwork and the set comes with a booklet. The selection is outstanding, covering symphony, chamber and vocal or opera, with works from about 40 composers from different musical periods, with a good mix of top notch conductors, orchestras and guest performers. Overall sound quality is great. For those who want to know exactly what you'll be getting, a complete CD list with performance details (and ten links - the max allowed) is included below.<br /><br />This set is well worth the price (as of this writing) and much more convenient and compact than buying the individual CDs (provided you could even find them all). If you are a long time classical music fan, you may have already owned most of them, but you may find some jewels. If you are new to classical music, this is a must-have set. Now, don't hurt your ankle on the way down off the fence.<br /><br />CD 1 - Bruch: Violin Concertos No. 1, op. 26 & No. 2, op. 44, Scottish Fantasy; Kurt Masur / Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra; Performer: Salvatore Accardo (Violin), Elisabeth Unger (Harp)<br />CD 2- Schubert: Lieder;

B0096CDG0O|3.0|Its yahtzee. You can play it with your friends when you're bored. There's no other games just yahtzee. I like it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A love story different from what I expected. Great characters and dialog. Very enjoyable read with insight into quad life.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Loved this book.  Stayed up all night to finish it.  Another great John Corey tale!  NelsonDe Mille is the best. My favorite author.
B004XVMCPI|3.0|this was great at 3 am- don't know if it's as good when you are really awake!<br />It's crouching tiger hidden dragon merged with soccer and a lame underdogs triumph blend.<br />I sent it to my nephew for a break from college studies.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What can I say, a minor addiction and great stress reliever. Never really saw myself playing games, I was mistaken.
1574214276|5.0|I was a bit dubious, since the author seems to take anybody's idea and crank out brief (and often superficial) how to books on a wide variety of fad-like trends (and has for years). But I'll credit the contributing authors (and perhaps Suzanne's growth?) for making this a valuable and respectful introduction to Zentangle.<br />I was a bit reluctant about Zentangle in general; if you already know you can draw, this seems like a formulaic, needlessly structured excercise.<br />But I have presented the Zentangle process to my art students (mostly retired or at least grown adults, many of whom have well developed art skills) and they love it. I'm somewhat drawn in as well, much to my surprise. Don't mistake this for a mere drawing strategy; it reallly does offer more than that in creating a quite, still moment: meditative.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Bobs last records since Time Out Of Mind have all been amazing and this is no exception. I love his voice and his highly advanced songwriting. This man is a true American treasure. Great recording! Roll on Bob!
0880796863|4.0|but you will want other decks beyond this one if you stay interested.<br />the &#34;Radient&#34; version is more colorful.<br />I dislike the design on the card back.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Excellent Series!! cant wait till next episode :) highly recomended 1/2 hr of time!!!! absolutly love the suspense, cant get enough
B0063HBPH6|5.0|At the end of this Kindle edition, it makes mention of the numerous sales of this novel (since it first came out in book form back in 1990) and the premise that many fans of Pratchett and Gaiman's hilarious Apocalyptic tale purchased more than one copy of \\"Good Omens\\" after loaning them out or dropping them in the bath. Well, this Kindle edition was my fourth reading of my fourth purchase - paperback, hardback, audio and Kindle versions. (Yes, my first paperback copy DID make it on to someone else's book shelf - still can't recall to whom I loaned it though.)<br />Suffice to say, it was an absolute pleasure to reintroduce myself to the myriad of characters that make this novel such an entertaining read. (And at least now I'll have the book with me when I travel and wish to begin reading #5 - I just have to remember NOT to read my Kindle version when taking a bath!)
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I hate to reread books but I have read this one twice. Each time is laugh out loud funny! It's very Bridget jones.
1935670913|1.0|In a nutshell. Write 4 books with a main carry over character. Gotta be ready for the big campaign. Tweet like a crazy man/woman. Have your blog ready to roll along with your website. Facebook always helps too. Self promote...self promote. Go in cheap to get the numbers up, then increase your price by 300%. It's all about the consistent profit baby. Content doesn't really matter that much because it's really all about fun. Yep! A reader just wants to have fun after a long hard day of brain surgery! And the secret that isn't in the book.....Start a false positive review campaign. Could cost you though.<br /><br />Oh..and have readers e-mail you so you can keep em posted about the next book. You know. That book you have already written. Or the book your ghost writer wrote. Just saying that's how I would throw down because I just can't write a book every 8 weeks. And if I could I would probably follow Stephen King's advise and stash it for awhile and then go back to it. Quality in content thing.<br /><br />I bet Locke has ghost writers pumping this stuff out. This is all about business as usual. But hey! If he is making that surgeon smile after a long day at work, then high 5 for his love of mankind.<br /><br />Does Locke only return his e-mails to the I Love All Your Books Club Members? LOL!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evermore for everything. It remembers anything. One of the neatest functions is that it'll OCR even your graphic scans. I now have over 3,000 notes. At work I have a complete library of all my reference materials at my finger tips
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was great. You're pulled in through a feeling of sympathy and compassion for the narrator, and as you read on that feeling turns to joy. Every chapter leaves you wanting more. When it's finally over I felt myself wanting more, to know what would happen next, but that's what is so great. It leaves it up to your own interpretation. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing book, a must read in my opinion, but don't be surprised when you finish if you are left with a feeling of wanting more.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|This movie needs another good review like the Middle East needs more hatred of the West. Still, a fantastic journey with a lot of suspense and fun. Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman are great too.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Este debe de ser uno de los mejores libros que haya tenido oportunidad de leer. Es cautivante la narración, la cantidad de tramas, y lo poco que esperas y que sucedera en el mismo.<br /><br />Una lectura obligatoria!
B0074AGVWK|5.0|Wonderful characters as usual.  A very enjoyable read.  Ms Binchy will be sadly missed.  I have read all her books and enjoyed them all.  They are so easy to read and the story flows along without being bogged down with too much \\"description\\" or getting off track with a lot of page filler dribble.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I love this series and am excited to be able to own it. Have enjoyed it for many years. I plan on buying all the series
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was an interesting book since I am sure people do things at the last moment or as a whim and then have to live with the consequences. If was written in a way that was interesting and showed two people trying to make sense of what had happened.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The dialogue is smart and funny with many quotable lines.  The plot is great and the characters are fantastic!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Just finished watching the movie and I got to tell you, it is really good. For a bunch of old guys(well, except for Jason Bonham anyway) the three original members of the Zep still know how to rock. This is a first class production from the get go. Crisp clear picture and the sound, wow, the sound is just fantastic. I watched in the 5.1 mode and I felt as though I were really there.<br /><br />If you like Led Zeppelin then you owe it to yourself to pick this up.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Entertaining and well written fun read.  Can not wait to see the movie this summer. I would recommend to anyone.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|I found the book interesting about the start of communism in Russia and how brutal it was.  I enjoyed the author's style although I had trouble connecting everything at first.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the most fantastic game I have ever played I wish it had more you need to get it
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|What can I say, been a longtime fan.  Was lucky to see them with Cyndi and the B52s awhile back.  Now here they come with a delicious CD of focused gems.  Thematically Id say its their strongest album, musically Id say its the perfect advance in their style.  I love that they sold out their show here in town (even though I didnt get tickets).<br /><br />Buy this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game!! I love this game and it's so simple. you don't need to pay real money if you don't want to and can still get the bucks. Yay lol
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these for running. I like the in-the-ear fit but do not like ear buds. These stay in place, yet allow me to still hear the sounds of traffic around me. These usually last me about 2 years, so they are a great value.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Just as described and great for a 6 year old (not to mention thirty-something dad) to put together.  Set is great and we love it.
0316228532|3.0|I read the book and liked it. J. K is a wonderful storyteller. I like the blend of emotions i felt during the reading. Tough situations like the one these characters go through are all to common for all members of society. Great work. My only complaint about the book is that not much time lapsed in the character lives from start to finish. After reading this i will certainly be purchasing any other novel she decides to put out.
B002WJI658|5.0|Great size, good details, and durable for a 6 year old boy who loves to throw around his toys... lol
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It seemed to have more violence than the 1st 2.  Not enough aliens.  Aliens weren't as interesting. But, I did enjoy watching it.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Gone Girl was an ok book, starts off on a really slow pace with the author explaining about the characters..<br /><br />liked the narration by the characters themselves, was a new kind of book that ways... too many twists & turns, but gets a little dragged towards the last 30 pages or so..
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Art sure did mirror reality in this movie.  Liam Neeson loses his wife in this movie and Emma Thompson's husband cheats on her in the film....talk about reality!  It really happened to both of them!  This movie is a joy to watch and the stories of the couples are fun to follow.<br /><br />You'll love it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The version solved the issue I have with my Samsung tablet. Now I can download and read any book i wanted. Thanks
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I started to read this series back when it first came out many years ago. I reread it after it became an HBO series I liked it then and still like it. I can't wait to read the next book but want to watch season 3 on HBO first so I don't get to far ahead!
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Amor, pasión, intriga, familia, pero sobretodo lealtad!<br /><br />Maravilloso escrito, el cual recuerda que los &#34;libros son el espejo de quien los lee&#34;
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best app I have downloaded since I got my kindle fire HD! It's fun and scary and totally worth the buck!! And no it's not laggy at all on a kindle fire HD!! I have one with the 8.9 screen, I don't know if that makes a difference but it's great quality and effects!! It's better than the computer version!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Ethan Hawke as usual is very good in this movie a very different plot, if you like teenage girls being chased getting their throats cut, you will not like this film. If you like an intelligent well acted film that did not need the usual trash they usually put in horror films, then rent this film you will not be sorry. If you like the usual braindead horror flicks you do not have to follow and think about do not waste your money.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was my sequel to Bared to You and I was not disappointed. I continue to be pulled in by the characters and story line between Eva and Gideon. I look forward to the next one to even see if something blossom between some of the other characters this is a book that has love triangles,pain, and trauma in many aspects not only between our two main characters. ....Also on a professional note I agree that concerning all of the couple's pasts issues I'm glad to see that they continue to seek therapy some books just seem to gloss over these issues and think they disappear again this only made my continued reading experience better.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Harry's boss is a bit one dimensional, all about PR. Harry is all about justice. The collaboration with an internal affairs cop is very unrealistic. The success in prosecution despite obviously illegal/unconstitutional actions on Harry's part is unrealistic.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good read, but much more formulaic than earlier Bosch novels. The earlier books felt more like you were doing a ride-along with real cops, although those books also had some unrealistic success resulting from iffy procedures.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Confusing in the end. Also sad in the games. VERY BORING in the beginning. But beginnings aren't the whole book. RIGHT?
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This movie was well directed and the pace is reasonable with each scene moving in a natural order. I would recommend people watch this film.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|My son and I pick a season of something to watch every few months and we really enjoyed this one.  We're about to get season 2
B00AWFEBDK|5.0|There were many things that I learned from this book such as how to settle dispute, treat the elderly and raising<br />children.  I came to understand my way of thinking had been stereotyped and programmed .<br />Now I respect the people of the traditional societies and I feel more free to choose what I believe right.
B000OSC3GM|5.0|John Frankenheimer recalled, \\"Paranoia only exists if the circumstances are totally untrue.\\" As for The Manchurian Candidate, he said history has \\"vividly demonstrated that there are lots and lots of plots to assassinate presidents and high-ranking figures for political gain...There's a certain grotesque reality about The Manchurian Candidate. And as far as Seven Days in May is concerned, we know that there was a very definite group in the military that would have, at one point, liked to have taken over the government...The extreme right has been very, very effective in undermining quite a few things that could've changed the destiny of this country.\\" (Brothers, David Talbot)<br /><br />One summer weekend in 1962 while out sailing with friends, President Kennedy was asked what he thought of Seven Days in May, a best-selling novel that described a military takeover in the United States. JFK said he would read the book. He did so that night. The next day Kennedy discussed with his friends the possibility of their seeing such a coup in the United States. He told Paul Fay, \\"It's possible. It could happen in this country, but the conditions would have to be just right. If, for example, the country had a young President, and he had a Bay of Pigs, there would be a certain uneasiness. Maybe the military would do a little criticizing behind his back, but this would be written off as the usual military dissatisfaction with civilian control. Then if there were another Bay of Pigs, the reaction of the country would be, 'Is he too young and inexperienced? ' The military would almost feel that it was their patriotic obligation to stand ready to preserve the integrity of the nation, and only God knows just what segment of democracy they would be defending if they overthrew the elected establishment. Then, if there were a third Bay of Pigs, it could happen. But it won't happen on my watch.\\"<br /><br />Ted Sorensen recalled that JFK joked darkly about how \\"I know a couple [of JointChiefs] who wish they could\\" overthrow him. (Kennedy p684). Arthur Schlesinger related how Kennedy saw the book as \\"a warning to the republic.\\" (RFK and his Times p485) John Frankenheimer recalled, \\"President Kennedy wanted Seven Days in May made. Pierre Salinger conveyed this to us. The Pentagon didn't want it done. Kennedy said that when we wanted to shoot at the White House he would conveniently go to Hyannis Port that weekend.\\" (The Celluloid Muse: Hollywood Directors Speak, Charles Higham and Joel Greenberg, 1972 Signet, p92)
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Argo follows Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) as he plans and leads a CIA rescue mission during the 1979 Iran hostage. Argo is an intense, suspenseful, and entertaining thriller.<br /><br />Argo's story and storytelling are great. I was not familiar with the actual events prior to watching this film, but this film managed to spark an interest on the subject. The story in this film mostly relies on its extremely suspenseful situations; I suppose it's even more suspenseful for those unfamiliar with the real story. Along with the suspense, the film also uses drama, action, and even some comedy in a well-balanced and consistent manner; plenty of memorable characters and dialogue. Argo begins with an intense, unforgettable raid, as you can see the fear and worry in all of the characters preparing for the inevitable. The ending of the film, the last 30 or so minutes, is the definition of \\"suspenseful.\\"; it's a dreadful edge-of-your seat finale. The storytelling is tight and smooth; as in, it's easy to follow and doesn't have much filler content. The performances were great. The music really helped create the atmosphere, tone, and authenticity of the film. Also, the credits of this film has a comparison between the film and actual photographs of the events/people, this segment really showed the attention to detail and the aesthetic authenticity; I really liked this. The pacing was fast, in my opinion, and I was fully immersed throughout the full runtime. Ben Affleck's direction was also superb, like in his other two films.<br /><br />Overall, Argo is a beatifully crafted, perfectly executed thriller; the film is suspenseful, thrilling, unique and, most importantly, very entertaining. I HIGHLY recommend a purchase, if you already have strong doubts about it because it is a critically-acclaimed film or because it may not be 100% accurate then I recommend a rental.<br /><br />Argo has some strong violence and blood.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|The author's wrting is so descriptive that you are transported mentally into another world - this is a book for all ages. I am now in my 87th year and this book is the one I keep closest to hand. My closest aqaintance is reading the same novel and we are constantly exchanging thoughts about the writings, which aside from being informative, are extreemly funny.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I love angry birds, I have no issue with ad supported games.  I have a real issue with an &#34;ad supported game&#34; that constantly launches full screen ads that last substantially longer than the level you just played.  The in game ads are fine, and while they do alter the gameplay they're quite acceptable.  The splash screen ads often pause so long when loading as to render the game unplayable.  Regardless of how lovely in-game experiences are if 3/4 or more of your screen time is devoted to sitting passively in front of it waiting for the 80th aflac ad to load you're going to quit playing.<br /><br />If you like angry birds buy the full version, skip this polished turd.
B007456DSW|5.0|My granddaughter had these listed on her Christmas Wish List. I remembered how much her dad enjoyed assembling and playing with his legos when he was the same age. Always a quality product that encourages the imagination and creativity.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great example of how formula can continue to engage us. Well developed characters plus talented actors always a win. And it still works even after the two get together. Don't have to upset the apple cart a la Downton Abbey to keep us tuned in. Plenty of ways to explore relationships if the characters are well written.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I purchased this set of legos for my granddaughter because she had these listed on her Christmas Wish List. She loves legos and I have always felt they were a quality product which encourages children's imagination and creativity.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I' ve read every book Nicholas Sparks has written and the plot twists in Safe Haven kept me on the edge of my seat. Whether you read every oneof his books or are new to them, you will love the suspense and the bond that the characters build. Great read!!
1401201911|5.0|“Superman: Red Son” re-imagines how Superman and the world would have changed if “Big Blue” had landed and been raised in the Soviet Union rather than Smallville, USA. While re-imagining and reinventing comic book heroes, both on the printed page and on the big screen, has been going on for some time (and indeed I believe this comic set was first published in 2003), very few of these efforts have stood out as being particularly worthwhile.  I’m happy to say that “Superman: Red Son” is one of the rare exceptions.  Much like “Batman: the Dark Knight Returns” and “The Watchmen”, this comic could also pass for literature, as it is deeply layered and entertaining even if you aren’t tremendously familiar with the characters.<br /><br />While being well drawn, cunningly plotted, and very literate, the book also brings other familiar characters from the DC Comic universe into the story, most of which are somewhat re-imagined as well in this brave new world.  However, to a surprisingly large extent, the tale remains true to the official “canon”, and there are only a very few things that don’t ring true.<br /><br />In short, I found this comic to be fantastic and recommend it very highly.  Five stars.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Powerful character study. Very intimate portrait of a man and his demons. Always love Denzel and the roles he brings to the screen.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|Movie was entertaining for my  grandaughter but the quality of the disk was terrible kept starting over and froze in many spots you need to replace the disk with a new one
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Maybe I'm getting tainted to it, but this season is not quite as good as Season 1.  The story is still very good and the actors are quite good.  We are still enjoying it and plan to watch Season 3.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I kept expecting it to end. Great time!! Definitely worth the time. I enjoyed and so did my twelve year old son.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I liked this book a lot but I felt at times it did drag on and thought this could've been edited down a bit more to help with the flow. That said, I thought this book has a fresh twist on paranormal creatures and the twists and turns were fun to put together. Looking forward to the next book.
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|Pros: Pretty good performance for the price $219. Overclocking increases performance well (make sure you get the version with the &#34;K&#34; at the end of the 3570 to be unlocked).<br /><br />Cons: Could be a little quicker with some tasks, but it's not a i7. Nor does it cost like an i7.
0385342055|5.0|What a charming book! I admire the way Kinsella has allowed Becky to become more mature in some ways but remain delightfully fun and nonsensical in others. Mini Shopaholic is a worthy addition to the Shopaholic series.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|good show good actors i really liked it.  probably should have bought it instead of renting, do they give that option with credit for the rental fee?
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This is my favorite go to game for passing time and skilled fun. It's tricky not too hard but takes practice to get to upper levels! I enjoy a lot.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This movie is amazing. The story seamlessly alternates between real life and a virtual world called Oz. The characters are, for the most part, well defined and different. Their is not much character development but it didn't bother me much.<br />The animation is top notch, and the dub is fantastic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched all three seasons in the last couple of weeks and LOVE this show.  Was an upsetting end to the season though!  Can't wait for Season 4!
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I'm not sure what's going on because this product has a lot of good reviews. I got mine to record voice narrations with an iPhone 5, along with the mic adapter that another review recommended, but the gain was very low and the sound was muddy. When I boosted the gain to a normal level in an audio editing program, the white noise in the background was too loud to be usable.<br /><br />I also tested this with my MacBook Pro, which has both mic and line inputs. This allowed me to test the mic with and without the adapter. The adapter added more noise and muddied the sound quality. Without the adapter, the sound had a more natural tone and was crisper, but even then the background noise was too much.<br /><br />I then compared the sound to the standard mic/headset unit that came with my iPhone, and that sounded much better. It recorded the same amount of background noise, but the signal was so much louder that the signal to noise ratio was usable.<br /><br />Another review mentioned inconsistent quality control with this mic, so I exchanged it for another one (which was very easy, thanks Amazon!) but the second mic had the same problem. Now I'll be sending back both the mic and the adapter. I'm happy for those of you who enjoy this mic, but it was too noisy for me!
B0053JJLLC|4.0|In the tradition of  a typical Michael Crichton novel, this book was fast-paced and an exciting read. I loved it and will recommend it to all lovers of this genre. Too bad Crichton is not around to entertain us. I miss him.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. It's a shame this hero is no longer with us. RIP Chris Kyle. America needs more of you
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Good book easy to read. Made me laugh many times as the author pokes fun at himself. If you are interested in space travel and the science that gets you into space this is a book you may enjoy.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is such an amazing book. Truly heart gripping. A great read for anyone struggling in life. I cannot wait to see the movie!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics. Grandkids love taking care of the horses!  Fun for all ages.<br />Would recommend it for Anyone that loves horses.
B008133MDK|5.0|A-1 mystery. On par with original Holmes. Both actors fulfill their parts. Cannot see anyone else portraying the characters. Like Basil Rathbone before them.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|For my taste this book was a little too graphic. Spoiler Alert- I personally didn't want to get into the mind of an anti social psychopath and hear vivid descriptions of how he abused his wife. I'd rather read to escape and this was not it for me. I would have rather read more about how the relationship between the two main characters developed and spent less time with the husband. Im not sure if Ill  want to see the movie or not.  I also read The luck one and like the movie better. Its usually the other way around but in this case I preferred the movie adaptation. I'm not a huge Sparks fan but wanted to give this one a shot. Probably wont read any more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A fun game that will kick your butt. I enjoy it very much. If you like a game that tests your reflexes, this is the game for you.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I love Ethan and Lena's story and all the characters. Wonderful Book. Can't wait yo read more of their story.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I love it!!!!!!best game ever!!!!!! but I wish it was free I mean I got the free version but it was not good enough its only 99cents
B000QCS9NM|1.0|but it's the first word that comes to mind. I'd like to \\"choke\\" the woman from my book club who suggested this book. Club met last night and not one woman liked this book. Some couldn't even finish reading it because they were so disturbed they lost sleep. I truly regret that there's a record on the world wide web that I even purchased this smut.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|This is hilarious, will recommend it to someone else. A talking cat u can't beat that. When I need a laugh I just go to that download.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Love this movie. My kids love this movie. They will watch it at least once a day. If not more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it!my friend recommended it to me and I am so grateful :) it is an awesome game!!! Highly recommended!!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I read the first book of the trilogy and was fascinated with the detailing of characters and happenings.  Book II continues the storylines and is fascinating in itself.  Can't wait for Book III!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game and I really hope you do too.  I think this game is fun and I enjoy being challenged by a game like this
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Originally I wasn't a big Evernote fan, I found other programs to work with instead. Now however I love Evernote. It's the best program I have found to sync between my laptop and my original Kindle Fire. I don't have to email things back and forth between my devices and can make changes on either device :)<br />Great functionality! Thanks Evernote!
B007N6EUHI|5.0|it is a good one, i'm going to use this a lot all over town, i very happy with it.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|No functionality without purchasing the app. I guess it's fine if you only plan to work on a calendar on one device but my goal was syncing calendars across multiple devices and this didn't help.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I like the idea of this bag with compartments and wish there were a smaller version as it was just too large for my small 5'2&#34; body. I also decided that I would stay with only two lens which don't need this large bag.<br />It seems to be well made with sturdy fabric, padding & many nice compartments. If you have lots of equipment & are tall or stout, you'll probably love it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy's Threat Vector kept me on the &#34;edge of my chair&#34;--couldn't put it down until I finished it. Clancy has a vast knowledge of computers/cyberhacking, China's political structure, and flying F-18s in dogfights. Yet he is able to describe all these things it in easily understood and exciting terms.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Its like a blast from the past with upgrades lol. Easy to get sucked into and its great that there are check points and it is saved at every level completed
B00005MCX2|5.0|Are you looking to have your face melted? Well then look no further. This is about as psychedelic as it gets. Turn this one up to 11.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Its a chill game and easy to pick up a play. The system of control is a little weird at first but once you try it gets easier. Works great on the Galaxy S3. Enjoyable game!
B009I2UH2W|4.0|I bought this to attach to my iphone 5 which I am using with a GripGo (that phone holder seen on TV...it actually works well too). Anyway, the Gripgo is on the windshield and the plug goes from the lower center console on my Subaru to the windshield. Some reviews stated the plug is too tight and does not expand enough. I do not find this to be the case. The plug easily reaches the 10-12 inches I need and I can expand it further as well without it pulling too much. If I stretch it out far then I can see it being an issue, but unless you're trying to reach the backseat of the car with this who cares?<br /><br />I do agree with those who complained about the bright white LED light on the plug itself. It is bright, but I do not find it distracting at all. However I can see it being distracting if it were higher on my console. As such Griffin should consider changing this to blue or make it a small pinhead light instead.
B00006CXSS|5.0|One of my hubbies favs. He actually wore out the first set and we had to replace it. Good series.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What an excellent book! This should be required reading for everyone! It has a lot to say about the way we view others,and is very realistic in the way the characters are presented. No one is all good or all bad, but rather they struggle with parts of themselves that are noble and parts that are not. This is excellent reading for young people but it is truly a book that  transcends  any age category. It is sensitive and inspiring. Our culture is desperately in need of more books of this caliber.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|This is an instant classic. The story is original and yet not. I put it right up there with &#34;Coraline&#34; and &#34;James and the Giant Peach.&#34;
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I first saw the movie,which made me really want to read the book.  They were both completely excellent though there were a lot of differences. Really excellent, I'm sad I'm done reading it... guess I should go see the movie again! ;)
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Surprisingly good. Wonderful story with a good message, fantastic special effects, breathtaking cinematography and the added benefit of being true. Gerard Butler gives an amazing performance as Jay's mentor, Frosty. As usual he's honed his body to fill the role (and the wetsuit)!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I like 2 better. This one you have to restart all over in that world if you die where in 2 you dont. You keep what you have. But a fun game.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Arrived on time, I love this I have watched it over and over, and will contuine to do so. Im a team Edward fan, but you cant help liking Jacob with not shirt on
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book! It was enticing and explosive! It was mind blowing and the story lines were amazing!  I can't tell you which character I loved best they all carries such diverse and identifiable characteristics!  I can't wait to begin the next book.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|The docutmentary was well done. I understand it has been nomitatd. I also shared it with family and friends who alos enjoyed the product.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|True to description, this cover is great! The leather feels real and the gold embellishments are beautiful. I've gotten asked whether it was a real book or not! At first I did have trouble getting the cover to stay shut but now that I've &#34;worn it in&#34; it closes fine! The only thing I'm concerned about is the gold embellishments on the cover wearing off.... but other than that, great product!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Although I'm a longtime sci-fi fan, for what ever reason I never watched Fringe when it was in first run production. I watched my first episode of Fringe a few weeks ago and was immediately hooked. It has great storylines. J.J. Abrams is a true sci-fi visionary!
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|After a while the game gets boring. It's ok, but you're just doing the same thing over and over again, and the last level is really hard. I spent 7 hours trying to finish that level
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun. It is reaaly cool. It is nice. It is interesting. Jale is veey cool. It was made well. I like it. This game is free.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. You will play it for hours on end without even realizing that the time had gone by so fast. I f you like card games, this is the game for you!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|My 8 yar old Who is a fan of the super heroes, especially Iron Man loved the movie. He says he wants to watch it again....and again.....and again. So now it looks like I may be purchasing the movie instead of renting it again
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this game is great for all ages. It is very entertaining to play and it is a lot like temple run (if you like that game). I suggest it for anyone who likes action games and running games.
B00BHAVGQY|4.0|If you have not seen the walking dead, you are missing out.  The show is great, it focuses on the humanity (or lack there of in most cases) and of course, gut wrenching zombie gore.  This show is an instant classic, hopefully it plays for several more seasons.<br /><br />Can't justify paying a $2.99/per episode price though, what the heck... if it were $0.75, yeah maybe.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|This book was interesting, but definitely not the best book I have read. I have read the rest of the series, and think that it should have ended after the first one.
B00B6DTWM2|1.0|Sinister is a embarrassment to all movies, not just the worst, most boring horror film imaginable. How anyone could find any redeemable quality in this hodge podge of nothing is beyond human comprehension. I am a Ethan Hawke fan, or at least I was. OK, He is still a great actor, but he missed the boat in signing on for this disaster. A dud, dead in the water, clunker. A real stinkeroo. Law & Order Criminal Intent vet Vincent Di'Nofrio has a brief role, and I do mean BRIEF. He turned out to be the lucky one, as the less time onscreen in this disaster the better. I don't know what the Director of this crap got, but it should have been LIFE plus 20 years. The first hour put me in a coma, but unfortunately I woke up and finished the movie. I was left feeling nothing but contempt for subjecting myself to this flaccid, limp, dirty dishrag. A omelette made with rotten eggs would have been more appetizing.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Do you know why I love vevo is because they have every music you could think of. I love it
0345529057|5.0|I bought the books because I have been enjoying the HBO series. The books, as expected are better than the TV series, but I am impressed with the overall cohesion of the TV series with the written word.
0307352153|5.0|The best popular study that I have read on introversion.  Obviously the author is an introvert, and to some extent it is a polemic against current societal norms that value extroversion over introversion.  She makes a strong case for how the strengths of introverts are under appreciated.<br /><br />This book has helped me to understand myself better, and how to better deal with a world that considers calling someone an introvert a pejorative.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Good book and good ending with a twist . Poor guy should have listened to him and Carl shoot the man
B000HZHBIM|2.0|Star Trek The Motion Picture came out as the first new Star Trek in ten years. Instead of covering new ground, it took the concepts of two Star Trek episodes and made them into a movie. It just didn't work. The movie had beautiful special effects, but the story and plot were lacking.
B0086213XW|4.0|This was fun to watch. Definitely entertaining, and sexy. Sort of typical plot and character development, no amazing and mind blowing scenes, but enjoyable.
1742200206|4.0|This Lonely Planet guide to New York City is very good for those wanting to see the major sights and events in and around Manhattan, but doesn't cover much else. This really isn't a serious criticism since there is a lot to do in NYC and no guide book that could easily be carried and used could possibly cover everything, so understanding what this is (and isn't) is important to getting the most out of the guide. I spent a lot of time in the city for my work and loved exploring the \\"tourist\\" sites, so enjoyed comparing my experiences with those found in this guide.<br /><br />The book is well researched, logically laid out, and much better written than most other guide books. The coverage of restaurants, hotels, museums, and theaters is accurate for those I personally visited and there is no reason for me to think that the rest of the content is anything but correct.<br /><br />While not the most inclusive guide book, it would be hard to do all of itineraries and events, so there is plenty of coverage of the important sites.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
034537410X|5.0|This book is really thick with knowledge, research and exercises. I did have a lucid dream after about 3 months, and have taken some of my own steps. Once you get interested and into the work it comes very easily. Great anecdotes and instructions.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Excellent adaptor, plug & play with Windows 8, good performance (I tested 59-84 MB/s TX, 65-106 MB/s RX, depending on packet size). Strongly recommended.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|- looking forward to the next four books in the series. It will be a good way to usher in Spring.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun to play when killing time and my kids love it also. Have a little trouble on the classic game though,hard to get 3 or more pineapples to unlock sword.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|game is fun to play! download was very fast love my KINDLE stuff and this is one of the best games!

B007X10OLE|5.0|Fun, high energy music from the series Season 1.  Love the talented singers from the show and enjoy the music.
B0012HEB32|5.0|I really liked this show. the characters were not 'perfect', they were real. real faults and real character. tho joh (JOhn?) is a little too well behaved, he gets his own digs in which is actually more realistic than not.
B0078JRFZE|5.0|really good show, great acting, plots, and character development. definitely worth the watch. can't wait to watch season 3 and find out what happens next!
B004PGNB1K|4.0|Rothfuss has continued to paint the picture of Kvothe's extraordinary world in The Wise Mans Fear. Much like a skilled artist, he provides just enough detail to colour the elements of every character and facet of life, but not so much that the story drags. Unlike many authors, Rothfuss never makes the misake of freezing the rest of the world outside the hero's immediate environment. Life goes on; the world changes according to its own rules, and many of those changes are not initiated by Kvothe.<br /><br />The peaks and troughs of the heroes life didn't resonate with me in quite the way they did within The Name of the Wind, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the story and can't wait for the conclusion.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Its very evocative of an old way of life in rural Ireland.  The story holds your attention and is surprising in the end.
B000IDGDPA|4.0|Short and sweet ... acting is good, plot is well executed.... nice movie for the gals... not sure the guys would appreciate it as much... nice depiction of the evolution of love... young and old..., heartfelt
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a great book! My husband wouldn't go see the movie so I thought I'd read the book and I am glad I did. It was an easy and enjoyable read.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I'm a believer so I enjoyed his trip to heaven even though getting there was a little scary. Too much of the book was like reading a medical journal.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Who doesn't love Angry Birds?!<br />Classic tale of an avian species and their journey of determination to regain their swine-stolen offspring.<br />If you are one of the few people who haven't downloaded this, what are you waiting for?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love it i think you should git it not a waste of time so 5 star is the rite thing so git it it is so fun
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Amazon MP3 was preinstalled on my Android device, and I initially uninstalled it because I don't like &#34;Bloatware&#34;. However, I got an email from Amazon that said my former CD purchases were available through the Cloud Player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app. I enjoy the fact that most CD's are automatically 'ripped' to the Cloud once purchased, making my music available anywhere. Great product for FREE.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|i never buy games. i always play the free ones. i buy epic adventures cursed onboard for $2.99 and the game was very short and kind of confusing to navigate. this game has put a very nasty taste in my mouth and i love hidden items games. i do not like this one and i can say i will not be recommending.<br />im very unhappy and out $2.99.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|CD case arrived cracked, but the CD works fine. Great soundtrack from a great film. I only wish they'd included all of the songs.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|As a fan of the original, and a serial hater of re-makes,  I have to say this was a well done movie that manages to pay its respects to the original while taking us in a different and interesting direction.  A great flick for a Saturday afternoon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first temple run because there is way better graphics and you have diamonds that you can redeem yourself with
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Brings the story home, with a suprising twist at the end.  This series is just good plain fun.  Worth a couple of hours to finish-out the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Although it talks about very heavy and sad situations, the book keeps you attention due to the charisma of the main characters. Very sensitive.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|No imagination.  The writers are beating the same old horse, in the same old place.  Nothing new to advance the story, just some poorly imagined special effects.  This series has officially jumped the shark.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It's so fun and entertaining. But one problem with it, every time you complete a level and then exit the game it doesn't go back to the level you completed I  goes to the one you just got out of... but rather then that its fun.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie was MUCH better than I expected!  Better writing, delivery, effects, you name it, it was better.  My favorite Batman of all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a must have for anyone who waiting to let their imagination shine ... so basically build your world your way.<br />with so many blocks to choose from, you can build any thing!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Different game modes and random world generation make this a game of luck and choice with you deciding.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|The craziness of Shaun of the Dead with more special effects. This is a joy to show off my system
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game,perfect sound, and stupid scientists. A must have for any fruit ninja fan.<br />With different ways to customize your character its a perfect game for the car,a waiting room, or just anytime fun.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Had this on DVD but wanted to see it in all the glory that J Ford intended. I am very pleased.
B0086700CM|5.0|A game of skill, wits and luck. Perfect for anyone old or young. With unlimited lives and no end to the course, you can play for hours at a time on this addictive game
B0086700CM|5.0|I Loooooooooooooooooooooooooove it. Awesome. Its good for boys but not as good for girls its awesome all my friends have this great addictive game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A challenging colorful game of thought and luck. Try to fill a grid with lines as you connect the dots . more dots will appear and the grid will get larger every thirty levels.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!
0195073401|5.0|This book is really good. I can not imagine a better book to study microeconomic. It explains everything in great detail
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A direct sequel to the original. With the same high stake game mechanics and new, exiting, but dangerous challenges ... it,s a must have for any temple run fan.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Although there is much heart wrenching details throughout the book, yet it is a beautiful story that shows the power of love and hope.  I would highly recommend this book.
B005HSL626|5.0|I loved this game. With different blades to unlock, and tons of ways to play it's a perfect game for any time
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|I have long searched for horror films that do not rely on sex and gore to make their point.  I found it with the classic Insidious and I found it again with this movie.  I cannot put into works how fabulous this movie is, I can just tell people that they need to see it and see it multiple times to get things they might have missed the first viewing.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Very useful and helpful. Especially for something like projects, Is misunderstood word, or homework. I would recommend this to everyone.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|Great way to close out the era of Alfred the Great and the transition to his son's rule, during the Danish invasion period!
1601251556|5.0|this is truly and excellent purchase. The price is wonderful, and it's incredibly versatile. It works better than dungeon tiles for my group, seeing as we're constantly playing at the college library, or one of our group's many homes. If you games move a lot, or change settings too often for a set of tiles this is certainly DM sent.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Fun game. Needs minor changes; like bug fixes and better graphics highly reccomended. Freezes sometimes. Also, sometimes when I open the app, it wont load and it will go back to the home screen. Please fix.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is my 2nd go at this app. I play on my iPhone and now on my fire. Try it, you will get hooked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun, addicting game! Minor bug fixes. PLEASE notify players when next update comes around. I HIGHLY reccomend lowering the price of the mystery box, my family and friends complain about that ALOT. Thanks
0670026603|5.0|So exciting to find a book that immediately has the reader engaged in a fascinating, yet poignant story. Great lessons for life lurk beneath the surface of the tale offering much to learn about the lives of others.  Inspirational.<br />Could not stop reading. Will read more publications by Ms. Moyes.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Fantastic set - way better then the UK release. It has the original title & not the horrid ASSEMBLE sub-title (I want &#34;The Avengers&#34; - Not &#34;Avengers Assemble&#34; !). Great picture quality thoug it is ntsc & not pal and as far as i know pal has better colour & sharpness but im uncertain - looked fine to me. Very Happy & I recomended it for value & for anyone who intends to up grade to blu ray from dvd in the future. It also has a lenticulat outer slip case that has a very nice 3d effect
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I used this after I got an email and was pleased to find I can listen to music on any device with no worries about the hard drive crashing or the device dying.  My music is always there.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|PITCH PERFECT (2012) might actually be one of the more original, truly fun comedies that Hollywood has churned out in recent years. No parody, no annoying self-awareness, no (well, very little) cheap or silly humor. Just an honest, earnest, witty comedy with romantic undertones and great music! While the overarching plot might have been done ad nauseaum, Pitch Perfect still feels very original. The main reason is the subject matter: focusing on the world of collegiate acapella competition.<br /><br />Set at fictional fine arts college Barden University, Pitch Perfect stars the extremely talented Anna Kendrick, who nails it in her first starring role, after having played backup in all prior films. Kendrick is rock solid as the musically inclined and gifted, but introverted rebellious loner Beca, an entering freshman at Barden, who has a hard time fitting in and would rather quit college and become a DJ in Los Angeles, but her estranged father, a professor at the university, compels her to finish out her freshman year and joining a club and if she doesn't like it, then he'll fund her start in LA. So Beca tries out for the Bellas, an all-female acapella group at Barden.<br /><br />The Bellas are led by seniors Chloe (confidently played by the radiant Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (deftly played by Anna Camp), who recruit 8 new members (including Beca). Other newbies include Cynthia Rose (sublimely played by wonderful singer-musician Ester Dean) and scene-stealers Fat Amy (played with perfect comic timing by Rebel Wilson), Stacie (winningly played by super-sexy Alexis Knapp), and Lilly (hilariously played by Hana Mae Lee). These actresses combine with star Kendrick and minor characters Jessica (Kelley Jakle), Denise (Wanetah Walmsley), and Ashley (Shelly Regner), to form a winning combo of acting, musical, and dancing talent.<br /><br />Not to be outdone by the wonderful female cast, there are several male cast mates that make this film work, too. The Bellas' main competition at Barden are the defending international champion, the all-male group the Barden Treblemakers. Led by the obnoxious senior Bumper (hilarious work by Adam Devine) and returning most of the group from the previous year, including Bumper's second-in-command senior Donald (talented rapper Utkarsh Ambudkar), the Treblemakers pass on freshman and magician-in-training Benji (played with boyish charm by Ben Platt), but decide to add life-loving freshman Jesse (superbly played by the extremely gifted singer Skylar Astin) to their acapella ranks.<br /><br />Jesse is the film's love interest for Beca. Astin imbues Jesse with a charm, confidence, and bravado that stands out. Jesse and Beca have this cool, old-fashioned, slow-building romance that is simultaneously heartwarming and sensuous, thanks to the acting talents of Kendrick and Astin as the films romantic leads.<br /><br />The actors actually do their own singing, performing all the covers acapella and sound great while doing it, really selling themselves as true performers of this medium. They do ear-pleasing renditions and mash-ups of popular songs, both old and new. There's a great scene early on where the acapella groups square off against each other in a \\"riff-off\\" competition of popular songs. And the Bellas and Trebles performance routines, especially the ones in the climactic competition, are to die for!<br /><br />But while the film has it's share of music (and wonderfully performed at that), the film's focus is on the comedy element. This film could have easily devolved into just another run-of-the-mill, throwaway comedy, but it's nothing of the sort. Rather it relies on funny characters and situations, thanks both to a clever, witty script and wonderful performances. This is one of the best comedies I've seen in a LONG time! Directed with great detail and precision by Jason Moore, Pitch Perfect is an easy mixture of both musical and comedy.
0452289963|5.0|THIS IS A BOOK TO CHERISH;TO READ OVER AND OVER AGAIN SLOWLY,UNTIL YOU GET IT. WHEN YOU GET IT A WHOLE NEW WORLD AWAITS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL SEEKERS OF A DEEPER SPIRITUAL LIFE.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I like being able to watch my favorites any time ! Not crazy about the pricing since the show is carried on tv, but I don't have to store the discs either. Works for me.
B006T3RM08|4.0|This is a good product overall... it fits the mac wireless keyboard and trackpad well once you figure out how to do it right.  I ended up returning it though because I tended to have to remove my keyboard a lot to do other things and it was not practical because it ended up being a hassle.  For people who will be setting it in and never removing it this is a great product.  I also liked that you could use this with the magic trackpad ANYWHERE as it creates a hard surface underneath the trackpad so even if the keyboard is on your lap the trackpad will still work.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Wonderful story line with suburb acting. I will watch this one many times! now that Season 3 is complete, I will be ordering that one next.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Nice uncomplicated read that held my interest and provided a twist that I didn't predict.  It shed light on religious orphanages in the twentieth century.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Hours of fun. Recommend this game for relaxing fun.  Gave it only 4 stars because it is not entirely free.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|great i love it on my tablet i love looking at my facebook on my tablet.  It makes it easier when wanting to use it before bed...
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|KES MISERABLES.  I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED THE DVD FROM YOU, HOWEVER I DID SEE IT AT<br />OUR MOVIE THEATRE.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book takes you from the present, back in time to the lives of two women.  It's a family mystery with beautifully developed characters.  A fast read.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Book One was so outstanding, are we sure Ken Follett wrote this? First time he has ever disappointed me - didn't care about any of the characters at any point in the book, although I plodded through it hoping it would get better....
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Absolutely addictive. Sort of mindless.. wish the clock wasn't constantly running.  It is distracting . But all in all I really enjoy this game
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I had seen the movie over 10 years ago and wanted to share it with my family during the Christmas holidays.  It was raw for them and very interesting.  It kept our interest and many questions were asked by the children.  Once I told them what the movie was about, my young grandchildren could not wait to view it.  Great movie!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is really something unique.  It certainly gives your fingers  (and brain) the opportunity to move fast when you choose one of the classical pieces.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This is another great cd by Bruno Mars. His voice is amazing and when you think of all the big hits he co-wrote before putting out his own music, you can't deny he's talented. Whether it's a fast upbeat tempo song to dance or a slow song to make love to, Bruno has it. He has something for everyone and his voice NEVER fails.<br />To everyone saying they don't like the f-bombs or explicit lyrics, guess what, that's what you're reviewing-the CD that contains explicit lyrics. There is a parental advisory on the cover. If that kind of singing is not your cup of tea then purchase the CD that doesn't have the parental advisory (regular version) on the cover. Then there shouldn't be any problems with f-bombs or offensive language. You can't purchase a CD that says on the cover that it contains explicit lyrics and complain about those lyrics. That doesn't make sense. Just buy the cleaned up version.<br />I'm in my early 40's and don't mind the explicit lyrics. Even Bruno Mars pulls that off without a hitch. With or without explicit lyrics his two CD's Doo-Wops & Hooligans and Unorthodox Jukebox are two CD's with nothing but great music from beginning to end sung by a very talented singer/songwriter and are played everyday and I never get tired of it.
0385360169|1.0|I cannot understand what all the hoopla is about this book.I only  got to chapter 4 and I could not find anything interesting. I am so sorry that I spent my money on this &#34;BOOK&#34;, I wish I could send it back.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Heartbreaking and heart warming all at the same time. Makes you cry while smiling and appreciate the art of growing up. Loved it
B0007PALRU|4.0|Movie was really good.  It was a little long and was a little slow in getting started but definately help my attention.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is good, but can you make an update allowing us to make a portal to a world made of diamond,  and near the portal are iron pickaxes. can you also update it so we can have hatchets and spears that we can throw and can you update it so you can have a shield? Take your time, Mojang. You don't have to do them all at once. Thanks for Minecraft
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool yo I mean you can open boxes jump over trains very realistic yo people do spray grafiti on trains like this game very much because of these things
0793563836|5.0|Highly recommended.  You can learn all the basics, including reading notes. The accompanying CD is great as it helps you keep count and play along!
B0055PMURG|5.0|This is an awesome account of how God will take what we see as a tragedy and He will turn it into a platfprm for glorifying Jesus Christ. We don't know why bad things happen to good people, but we can believe God has a plan and a future for us, a place with hope and not to bring us harm. God only gives good gifts, but the enemy, the devul, comes to kill, steal, and destroy our lives and our hope in God.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|great movie, but as always, my complaint is that they put too much sex in to the movie. otherwise, it is great
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The portion of the book dealing with the mission to attack Bin Laden's hideout and the details of the attack itself were interesting reading. But, in my opinion, there was way too much preliminary information regarding the author's prior life and earlier military career.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|superbly written, directed and acted (so far...i'm in the second season)...i LOVE british period pieces and this is SO worthwhile.  :D
0670026603|5.0|[[ASIN:B0065GC0BA Me Before You]]<br /><br />Best-selling author JoJo Moyes' newest release \\"Me Before You\\" is plain and simple a love story; a read as contemporary as it is classic and beautifully written. It's hard to put into words the range of emotions you will go through reading this novel. The subject matter, depending on your stand, is as controversial as it comes.<br /><br />The setting is a rural town located in the shadow of England's Stortfold Castle. A town where unemployment is on the rise and the available jobs are few and far between. Louisa Clark resides in the town holding a go-nowhere job, and a leading a boring life. When her job becomes redundant Louisa is left floundering around town in search of a job. To make matters worse her long time boyfriend has recently become wrapped up in his passion for fitness leaving little time to spend together.<br /><br />Landing in the local employment office she is sent to one disastrous job after another when despite her numerous objections, she is persuaded to take a job as a personal companion to Will Turner, a quadriplegic man. As soon as she starts the job she is met head on by a difficult and often abusive man who does everything to push her away. After eavesdropping on a private conversation Louisa learns why she has been hired on for a six-month position and the possible outcome if she doesn't connect with Will and show him life is worth living.<br /><br />I dare anyone who picks up \\"Me Before You\\" not to be swept into the story. It would be impossible not to become emotionally attached to each of the characters Moyes' has created. In fact she does it so well the reader most surely will be championing Louisa's determination to change Will's outlook of life.<br /><br />You can't help but wonder if the author has personally known someone who has lived the experience, as she writes with such fluidity, or perhaps it's Moyes' experience writing with The Daily Telegraph, either way she is incredibly talented.Given the fact that the situation actually happens outside the context of the book, makes the read that much more poignant.<br /><br />Final thought; when you read the last word and close the book you will come away changed, wondering what you would do if faced with the same situation. One thing is for sure, have a box of Kleenex handy; you're going to need it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This book was given to me by Penguin Group USA for an honest and unbiased review
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's a shame this only lasted a season. Connected cast, good story, and well produced. This could have been an amazing and iconic franchise.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|If you haven't served in the armed forces or suffered through WWII this book will give you an idea of what it was like without being overly dramatic. One has to respect the honor and morals of many of these ordinary men who served our country. This book was one of my favorites because it told the story of two ordinary gentlemen and it had a great ending.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Still catching up...haven't had time to read everything I wanted to as I am doing my Masters and teaching.<br />Unfortunately, that means I read a lot of things I don't really want to.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry seems real to me. I can't tolerate the shows and books where the protagonist is a superhero and never gets hurt and completes feats of courageous proportion. Harry hurts and struggles just like a common man. If you like realistic fiction I would recommend Connelly's books.
0451232852|5.0|It moved along at a good rate<br />it is factual and really enjoyable  enjoyed every single word and did not want it to end
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This had some fascinating information in it about marketing and it makes sense. I can't say that it helped me change my habits although I &#34;know&#34; how they are formed. It is informational not inspirational.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|one of he best hores games but thay should have more cleaning things so u could get more mony and leval up faster
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Anyone who enjoys zombie movies or stories should get a hold of this and give it a read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This marvel has really helped me in ways I just can't explain. Thank you for creating you for creating this book. It really is a wonder
B00A80SHFM|4.0|The music is fantastic, however, if &#34;Do You Hear the People&#34; sing is not a highlight, then that's a huge disappointment.  I hope they will be releasing a complete soundtrack.  The music is best heard while watching the movie, but as most employers don't appreciate employees watching movies at work, topped with the fact that this hasn't been released, the soundtrack is a great alternative to the full experience.
B0000024JA|5.0|The order was great and I'm enjoying it right now! I will be looking for more music in the future. Thank You.
B0026FCNK2|5.0|Brad Pitt delivers a superb performance. Bruce Willis endures through time travel, flashbacks, trying to piece together the mysterious Army of the 12 Monkeys. Does he figure it out before earth is wiped out? Watch to find out... blu-ray picture and sound are great. It's still nice to watch movies before everything was shot in such high-def digital quality.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is the best mmorpg on a tablet. I have kindle fire hd, it plays just fine. No issues. A mmo always has small glitches and bugs. This game doesn't have too many. 5 star for what it is. I play with friends and its always a blast. Need to port swg.....
B0087YYHZU|5.0|This movie is great.  The music is nice and so is the acting.  There are extras so you can just watch the songs.  The picture and sound is good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so cool. And addicting. The graphics are sharp and well detailed. My favorite characters are Frizzy, Lucy, and Tricky.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Such a sad, sad story... I'm a little disappointed that I figured out everything that happened a little too early. :( That didn't make the story as good to me, but I still liked it, and the little games they played were endearing.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Good movie,  Like most should have been a bit shorter but enjoyed it.  Good acting and direction.  Pilots are human.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a beautiful story! This is one of those books where description and atmosphere are so important. The story is not told from beginning to end, and though, at first, I thought it was important to keep track of the dates, it's not important. A funny concept considering that time is mentioned repeatedly in this story.<br />The entire book was filled with such imaginations. Really, really wonderful! Filled with so much mystery, games, love, loss, despair, excitement.<br />Truly original story.
030758836X|2.0|An over the top effort to demonstrate ostensibly excellent writing. The author tries much too hard to make it work. I couldn't wait to get it over with. Almost threw it in the can along the way. Don't bother with it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Books that are full of surprises are my favorites. Books that are full of emotions are my favorite. Books full of poetry are my weakness.<br /><br />With that said, this book was amazing. My only complaint... it was too short!<br /><br />The lessons in this book are some that every should take to heart, especially, the lessons listed at the end of the book.<br /><br />I love the lyrics written at the beginning of each chapter. In my opinion, musicians have the most moving poetry. They're my favorite. The slamming in the book was really, really good too. So honest and open.<br /><br />Overall, this book was Wonderful; full of heartbreaking shocks, two funny-as-hell little boys with amazing personalities and imaginations, a sad love story, and life's sad endings.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|(Updated 4/12/13, 9/4/13)<br /><br />The Spartacus saga on Starz has given us some of the most powerful and dramatic television of the past decade, and this final season may just be the best of the lot. Spartacus: War of the Damned picks up maybe a year after the stunning finale of Spartacus: Vengeance. Having taken his revenge against the Roman patricians that enslaved him and killed his wife and friends, Spartacus leads what is now an army of liberated slaves in all-out war against the Republic.  He struggles with both the cunning Imperator leading the Romans against him and the growing tensions within his own army, mowing down legions and cities while gathering strength for what may become an epic battle for Rome itself.<br /><br />With this conclusion of the Spartacus series, Stephen DeKnight and company have achieved something quite rare in television, or anywhere else for that matter: an epic story simultaneously offering compelling plot, characters, action and drama, while staying remarkably close to (what we know of) the story of the real-life Spartacus.  It's a brutal story, and the show pulls absolutely no punches in the telling, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - this is some of the finest television I've seen since M*A*S*H.  Here's why:<br /><br />- With each season the scope of the story has grown, and the story line has become more suble and complex.  War of the Damned is no exception.  Spartacus and his army have Rome in a near-panic. The Senate enlists ultra-wealthy consul Marcus Crassus to hire an army and put down the rebellion.  From the first episode we see that Spartacus is facing an equally intelligent, deadly and determined opponent in Crassus; this is as much a war of wills and cunning as it is of swords.  Both commanders also have to deal with dissent and intrigue within their own ranks: Spartacus with Crixus's ongoing lust for strategy-free head-to-head combat, and Crassus with the struggle of wills between himself, his coming-of-age son Tiberius, and a young, mad-genius praetor named Gaius Julius Caesar. (Yeah - THAT Julius Caesar.)<br /><br />- Once again the cast has outdone themselves.  In reviews of the previous three seasons I've noted one or two exceptional performances, a task which has grown steadily more difficult as the overall quality of the acting has continued to improve.  This time around it's *really* hard to pick a standout; everyone involved with this show clearly gave their all and then some to wrap things up in style.  I'll name two, but bear in mind that there are about a dozen ties for a very close third place:<br /><br />---- Liam McIntyre.  It took him a few episodes in S:V to get comfortable with the daunting job of filling Andy Whitfield's sandals but fill them he did, and in WotD he has the role of the ruthless, idealistic warrior-king solidly nailed.<br /><br />---- Dustin Clare.  This season he backed off on the gonzo just a notch and it *works*, making Gannicus the perfect rogue super-warrior with just a hint of weariness showing through.  If he survives the series finale (airing in about 15 minutes as I write this) this is the guy I'd want to see in his own spinoff series.<br /><br />- Once again they've raised the bar with some of the best FX and cinematography on television.  The directors had a little fun with their state-of-the-art camera platforms this time, giving us some slick POV and following shots as the actors whirl and tumble in battle, and even more ambitious and exciting movie-quality CGI.  I'm looking forward to seeing the behind-the-scenes specials when the DVDs come out.  And, once again, they've used all these nifty tools to give us some jaw-droppingly powerful and beautiful moments; see below for one of the better examples.<br /><br />- In my review of Spartacus: Vengeance, I made a few critical points in that the two post-Blood and Sand series tended to start slowly and, more importantly, that the story was in danger of becoming lost in theincreasingly gratuitous and over-the-top sex and gore. I'm not so conceited as to think DeKnight and Co. read that review and instantly saw the error of their ways, but they've certainly listened to someone of like sentiment. This time around the story went into high gear literally from the first minute of the first episode and rarely let up afterward. The sex is still as explicit and the swordplay still as gory as ever, but they aren't shoving our faces in the latter as was becoming endemic in S:V; indeed, as in Blood and Sand, they're once again using it at times to genuine artistic effect.<br /><br />Best example: In episode eight, \\"Separate Paths,\\" a major character is captured and beheaded by the Romans (not exactly a spoiler in *this* series) as his lover is forced to watch.  A split-second before his end, the scene cuts to an extreme close-up of the woman, and we see the coup de grace reflected in her teared-up eye.  Beautiful (as far as that word can apply to a beheading,) and ten times the impact of just letting us watch the victim spew a gallon of blood and collapse.<br /><br />The end of the series is about 45 minutes away as I write this, and what I said in my review of S:B&S stands now more than ever: If you have any interest at all in historical fiction and you can handle the TV-MA material, this series is an unqualified must-see.  Five stars with blood-spattered laurel wreaths.<br /><br />(9/4)  Discs in hand at last!  So far I've watched episode 1 and the special features.  As with S:V, the quality in 1080p, even for the featurettes, is amazing; razor-sharp video that shows off the attention to detail that was put into the sets, costumes and such - it's more like a ten-hour movie than a TV series.  (As with the other season sets, that sharp detail also shows off some added, and at times quite gory, footage cut from the broadcast version.)  The special features were imho a bit heavy on training (the \\"Spartacus Workout\\" - oy) and a bit light on production stuff, but you still get a lot of good supplemental material: interviews with past and present cast members including a too-brief chat with Andy Whitfield, some good candid behind-the-scenes material both on- and off-set, and a very good, extended interview with Stephen DeKnight on how the series came to be, and the challenges they faced when moving beyond the fixed sets of the first two seasons to the slopes of Vesuvius and the hills of Rome.  You get a really good feel of the close camaraderie of the cast and crew both on- and off-camera, imho one of the major factors in making this show a success.  All in all, well worth watching.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Accurate weather forecasts since app installed.  I installed on my aneroid phone and Kindle and have not had any issues.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I'm not a game player usually, so I picked this game to hold my interest on my daily commute.  Twice now, I've almost missed my train stop because I've been so absorbed in my task.  Basically, the frame is that you, as a character, are looking all over town for your friend, Bill.  You meet different people, all of whom seem to have a real problem with hoarding, organization, and clutter.  You perform a series of &#34;find the objects in the picture&#34; tasks, along with some other picture games, with varying time limits.  Some tasks are harder than others, and it sometimes takes a few tries to complete the mission.  That's what's so addictive about it.  As for the story frame, I'm not sure what the puzzles have to do with the plot, but honestly, I don't even care.<br /><br />I would recommend this game to anyone who just wants a time waster, without getting involved in any world building or mythological gaming.  It definitely skews older; younger kids (12 or under) would get very frustrated very easily.  BTW, I play this on my Kindle HD, and the graphics are very clear.
B0018AJNH2|3.0|This was very similar to the original Cube movie.  If you liked the first one you will like this one also.
B008Y78M60|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this film, which has a very obvious political bent (Robert Redford-directed films can be very preachy, see Lions for Lambs, for example).  But I thought Robin Wright did an excellent job showing layers of the main character, Mary Surratt, so that you really weren't sure whether she had anything to do with the plot or not.  Clearly, the underlying theme of the film was the willingness and tendency for our government to disregard the Constitution and its protections in the name of public safety, and the film had clear parallels to Guantanamo.  James McAvoy was very believable as the reluctant defense attorney,although I wish just once the character would have (rightly) pointed out that all of the accused deserved a fair trial and skilled representation, instead of letting people get away with cutting him for representing Mary. I suspect the actual historical person would have done so.<br /><br />In the end, I learned a lot about the aftermath of Lincoln's assassination that I hadn't known before, even if the &#34;bad&#34; characters (the army officers and the sec of defense, for example), tended to veer into mustache twirling villain territory from time to time.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Sorry but this was a waste of time to watch.  I do not recommend it for anyone.  It made no sense and I couldn't figure out what was happening throughout the movie.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|A great movie, a must see film.  This movie will keep you interested because of it's plot to gain power.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games had me completely riveted from the first line to the last.<br /><br />It's a really novel idea, a fine depiction of what can happen if reality shows ever go too far.<br /><br />Despite me knowing that it's this fact which I should have been focusing on, I truly got involved in the Games. I found myself rooting for our heroine, Katniss Everdeene, wishing her competitors dead, wishing she would kill them, and truly hoping that she would win.<br /><br />As to Katniss herself, she's a bit of an enigma. She sometimes comes across as the tempestuous, temperamental teenage girl that she is, and often does completely unpredictable, irrational, and illogical things. Other times she's cool, calm and collected; a true survivor.<br /><br />She's a truly interesting character, and I'd love to play someone like her in a tabletop role playing game. She seems as though she was made for it!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Great Movie!  Would buy it again. I bought this movie because I viewed it on TV and fell in love with the story behind it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|seriously what could be better than a little om nom that eats candy off of a rope? I mean come on! if you don't like it you're crazy. end of discussion!!!! (3
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|This is one of the 90's gems I enjoyed the most. It's an amazing adventure story with fun moments and the amazing Robin Williams to boot. The creature effects are intentionally cartoon like (which makes them still funny in a good way even by today's standards) and the story is just fun and well paced. Jonathan Hyde as Van Pelt (and Alan's father) was amazing and the movie is just a joy to watch by kids and adults alike.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't wait until season 4 comes out, but hated the ending of season 3 and won't tell you why, but it's a great saga with a wide variety of characters.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Christopher Nolan never disappoints. In a time when Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas and only feels safe betting on reboots and sequels, it's extraordinary to see someone with the guts to make something original and successful.<br />Inception is an entreating film. It is smart enough to make you think and wonder (without trying too hard) somewhere amongst the adventure which is quite a ride.<br /><br />I'd also like to make a special mention of the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer always rules, but he outdid himself here.<br />One of Nolan's best, right there with Memento and the Dark Knight.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray has amazing picture quality and sound. Some people might complain about the special features, but they're fine as long as you don't let Lord of the Rings spoil you and expect every movie release to include more time of special features than the length of most miniseries.<br /><br />This movie is on par with precious few like Matrix and Dark City. It is smart sci-fi that makes you wonder and keeps you at the edge of your sit.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I Can't wait for season 3... Passing the set around to my friends and they couldn't stop watching them either.
B000002B35|5.0|I'm a little ashamed to recognize that I didn't listen to Pink Floyd during my childhood. My fascination with them began shortly after college when they became my favorite band after finally listening &#34;Dark Side of the Moon&#34; from begining to end. I quickly purchased almost all of their albums save for Ummagumma.<br /><br />Now, Pulse happens to be a Live concert with great songs like &#34;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&#34;, &#34;Hey You&#34; and &#34;Another Brick In The Wall&#34; on the first disc, and &#34;Dark Side of the Moon&#34; on the second disc. DON'T OVERLOOK IT. Seriously, the live versions are an experience, just as magnificent as the studio versions. Pulse is one of my most heard Pink Floyd albums and for good reason.<br /><br />If your'e Pink Floyd fan, then you've allready got it.<br />If you are just discovering Pink Floyd and liking it: BUY IT. Or check some of the songs on YouTube, then you'll want it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game to play. It is fun to challenge others. Must have game for entertaining young children.
B006WZIETG|5.0|I'm a 90's kid, so this movie gets a high ranking in my book just for the nostalgia factor as I'm sure it happens with most people my age. Still, the movie is hilarious and went ahead of its time with the overconfidence on technology and the dehumanized office themes.<br /><br />Granted, the first Gremlins is a better movie (in horror, story, structure, pace and pretty much just everything), but that's the adult me talking. Gremlins 2 is the one I enjoyed the most back when I was a kid and for good reason. Despite its flaws, it's just a fun ride.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this app!my 5 year old also plays it a lot.I wish the competitions had  a little more to them.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Smartly done and diligently faithful to the facts for the most part, Argo also succeeds because Affleck keeps the tension and humor going in what could otherwise have been a wonky or boring version of this timeless rescue-the-princess type plot.<br /><br />My only complaints are the introduction's sappy, college-level narration of recent Iranian history, and the final 20 or so minutes in which the movie reverted to stock, Hollywood-style formulas: the seconds counting down, the wild-eyed Middle Eastern stereotypes, and the protagonist's touching family homecoming complete with violin strings.  But the movie's strengths outweigh these problems, hence 4 of 5 stars.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I purchased this for my Aunt but watched a few episodes. I like this show and recommend it. It's on Netflix though.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its like... SO FUN! I just came across it like whatever but now I know why people love it! I really suggest this game if you really want to have some fun.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|If you are looking for something that is historically correct, this is not it. It is very entertaining with good acting and costumes. The first season had gratuitous sex scenes and nudity. The second and so far the third seasons are not nearly as porn-ish.  I would give the story lines, acting, costumes, and scenery five stars, but it loses one for the sex.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|This was the album that got me in to Evanescence as a band.  I liked Nightwish, and someone told me they were kind of similar so I listened to a few songs and got hooked pretty quickly.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Very satisfied with the game. It has a lot of levels and content for being a free game. Was relatively easy to install on my new Galaxy Tab 2 tablet.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible is the best!  I watched this on the internet when it first came out, and I've wanted to get it for a while now.  With talk of a sequel coming out this year, I just couldn't wait any longer to add it to my collection!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Very satisfied with the game. It has a lot of levels and content for being a free game. Was relatively easy to install on my new Galaxy Tab 2 tablet.
B003CN4R74|2.0|I really liked Fallen, The Open Door, and a couple of others...but this is just not very good.  There were only two tracks on it that were even halfway decent.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Very satisfied with the game. It has a lot of levels and content for being a free game. Was relatively easy to install on my new Galaxy Tab 2 tablet.
B0011Z3334|3.0|Some of the songs I really liked, but the rest were just &#34;blah&#34;.  I guess that's what I've come to expect when buying entire albums as opposed to cherry-picking the tracks.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Excellent!  One of the first games I installed on my new Galaxy Tab 2 tablet. Game runs good and contains ample levels for a free game offer.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|This album was pretty great, but I liked Fallen a bit more.  It's definitely worth what I spent for it.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Was a very good movie recommend it to everyone who values long distant friendships. Item as described and enjoyed it very much
B004VD3YIM|4.0|Using the free version. Fun to use. Some cameras may be slow to load. Occasional codec error. Otherwise great app.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I guess it had a fairly compelling story line for people who have followed the Bond franchise, but it seemed like just a bunch of people shooting at each other and blowing things up. Fun if you like that sort of thing.
B002VECM6S|3.0|Ordering from overseas puts one at a disadvantage with DVD's. Some DVD players are set for multi-region play, and so all good, but the new player we have doesn't play region 1, and haven't yet figured out how to change to multi-region, therefore the discs bought from Amazon US don't play. I've seen the movie on telly, so I know it's good.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|It works good for propping the Fire up to watch it, but my unit doesn't turn my Kindle Fire on/off when opening/closing because that part of the cover is a little bit bent and doesn't work properly. I haven't spent the time to try to unbend it, but don't feel like I should have to.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|These authors are such a great team.  Whatever the formula or however they do their writing, we just hope it never stops. The Pendergast series has it all, eerie surprises, mysterious events, and the little unexplainable details that make it so interesting.  Looking forward to the next installment of the saga!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy keeps it moving from the beginning and it is written well - almost reminded me of Patriot<br />Game which was one of my favorites.
B007SPN5MA|4.0|If you like the music from the movie he did then you'll like this cd. His songs are always unique.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved this second book in the series! Although it's a YA book, it was an enjoyable read for this adult. Can't wait to read the next book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this calculator. Great app. works well. Easy to use and read. love it. I cant say anything better about it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I got turned on to Jack Reacher by a friend and I couldn't put it down. It is well worth it
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Had me laughing and crying the whole time.  For once I didn't feel disappointed for reading the book and watching the movie.  Can absolutely love them both.  Must read for anyone who just loves a good ol' book.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|When you're in a barrack, there is a lot of different types of music floating through  the air, fell in love with this group.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is a very unique case and very easy to use and it fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|A game that really makes you think. You will have to be moving as fast as you can before the time runs out.
B0011Z32KI|5.0|Loved the music; loved the price; and loved that it downloaded perfectly, quickly, and I had no problems with any part of the transaction.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|I'm usually not into this genre but I love this record. This album is interesting, it's one of those albums that though each individual song sounds good you don't really appreciate it until you listen to the songs within the context of the entire record, all the way through. Singles don't do this album justice.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The language with John Goodman, nudity.  Hollywood needs to clean up their morals.  My husband finished the movie.  I left at the beginning.
B00513DGIO|3.0|Nothing new, or inciteful.  Good for self education. I would not recommend this book to any reader over the age of 19 years.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Good translation. Much better than a recent movie.<br />Some words were translated too literaly! I personally prefer it in French.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King has a great way of transporting you into a story. It was enjoyable to hang in the years of ago when things were cheaper and more innocent. ....And who does not want to have a chat with the Kennedy's!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this. It is so real looking. The closest thing to owning a real horse and still living in the city.
B00013F38K|4.0|The episodes are what I recall seeing when I was a kid. It is a good series.  Despite the scenes of self defense, it is a good series for the kids to learn patience and good values.  Product was delivered on time.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The screen writing is top-notch and the dialogue is spot-on.  Just the right amount of non-legal<br />subjects(romance, sex) and quite a bit of chemistry in the relationships.<br />The casting of Louis Litt was a superb choice as he seemed so out of place at first. And if you want a great villain,<br />Daniel Hardeman is working out perfectly.<br /><br />Also enjoy the levity that is present but not overdone.
030759565X|3.0|I like it but find most of the things are things I would not make. A handful are something I am interested in but most are not. I think to me, the book seemed a little over hyped. But that's probably just me. A nice book however.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Pretty cool port of my favorite Ipad app to the kindle.  I do wish the graphics were better., and my ipad friends can't interact with my Kindle ponies.  Overall, I am still playing it though
B008AK8FHM|4.0|To read a medical doctor's telling of his personal experience was very interesting, as people frequently keep such experiences private. To know the author is continuing to research and explore others' near-death and after-death experiences using his scientific approach provides hope to understanding who we are as humans. I have great admiration for Eben Alexander's work.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|This brilliantly crafted movie reminds me that somebody somewhere loves you and your art and that you should NEVER stop sharing your genius. I was poignantly entertained with the passion of the South African fan base for Sixto Díaz Rodríguez and the journey to find him. If you're a fan, not just of truly artful musicians, but of human element stories, then this is for you.
B008220D7S|1.0|I'm sure worse movies have been made, but I usually avoid movies that I know will absolutely suck (Twilight, Daredevil, the new Die hard, etc.). This one was a surprise. You figure the guy who made 40 Year Old Virgin would have another funny movie in him, right? No way he directs another dud after Funny People, right? WRONG!<br />Apatow used up all his rocket sauce halfway through Knocked Up. The tank is empty. All we get now are limp dick jokes, his children cursing, and his wife naked (15 years after anyone is intersted in seeing her naked). There are no serious laughs in this movie. Some giggles, like when the fat broad from Bridesmaids shows up, but no laughs. Albert Brooks is completely wasted in this movie, doing little more than laying guilt-ridden one liners on his son and making jokes about his toddler children (giggles, not laughs).<br />This movie certainly had the potential to be funny, but the &#34;funny parts&#34; are too spread out and after 20 minutes of watching the main characters arguing about (what pissed her off at that moment), having one of their kids dropping an F-Bomb just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />If you like long, boring movies that go nowhere, have no plot, aren't funny and aren't interesting, then by all means check it out. But be prepared for two and a half hours of jokes you've already seen, painfully delivered.<br /><br />THIS MOVIE BLOWS!
B008XKT9FG|3.0|I was lured into this movie by cast names of Hunt, Johannson and Wilkinson.  Of the 3 only Wilkinson belonged in this film.  Since  the film is based on an Oscar Wilde play it should probably have stayed on the stage.  It is very talky and slow.  Poor Helen Hunt seemed lost and out of place.  Scarlett pouted well but not much more.  Recently saw Helen Hunt in Sessions where she looked a lot more comfortable (and extremely fit) and gave a good performance.  Scarlett has also done very well elsewhere.  I won't hold this bomb against them.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Mesmerizing, spellbinding, a thrill ride. Definitely one of my best reads in a very long time. I really recommend it!
B00APACSJG|5.0|Ms. Bujold is THE mistress of space opera!  I absolutely love the Miles V saga, in fact WHY has this series not been made into a movie yet?  Perhaps because the general public is totally clueless when it comes to fun, fast paced intelligent intrigue.  No! We want sparkly vampires!  Bah.  Give me something I can sink my mental teeth into!  Ms. Bujold, more, please!!!
B00023BLXK|5.0|I like Dirty Dancing and watched it a lot over the years but I loved the music and dancing in this movie.The actors were great.Wish it had ended different but I didn't write it.I am a hopeless romanic.

B009E9R2OK|2.0|This is a stunning example of what media hype can do. Being a long time fan of Led Zeppelin from my school going days, I was absolutely thrilled at the release of this monumental concert, what more in High Resolution Blu-Ray Audio! My pre-order went in as fast as I could type in my on-line order, and I awaited with bated breath for the mailman.<br /><br />The day of delivery arrived and the disc was mounted in my OPPO BDP-83SE post haste to revel in the festivities of that night in 2007 when so many admirers were deprived of the opportunity to witness this event. Sadly, the production quality failed to live up to anticipated expectations and only served to cause severe audiophile erectile dysfunction.<br /><br />For High Resolution playback, this is a classic example of things gone wrong given the current state of technology. The sonic reproduction of this media rivals only that of a compact cassette tape, and an averagely recorded one at that. This is not the first time that this has happened in Hi-Res audio, but certainly the first for Atlantic Records. Even with up-sampling turned on, there is little recovery to the overall sound quality. I am used to getting this type of reproduction values from Sony recordings and many High Resolution downloads from HD Tracks. Anyway finger pointing at this stage is useless as the purchase is complete and final.<br /><br />The only saving grace is that Led Zeppelin STILL has what it takes and is a victim of post production artisans who have muffed up documenting this historical event rather badly. I have read other negative comments about the poor editing in the Video version of this concert, and would be inclined to believe them. Perhaps Atlantic tried too hard to make this concert a success, and in the process forgot about post production values.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read the whole thing through without stopping - and was utterly depressed afterwards:-)<br />Bought it because of the first movie and is now looking forward to the next two.
1594203334|3.0|As a Grandmother in America I found the book to be no different than the way I was raised and the way I raised my<br />Children. I find it interesting that women today are catering to their children and analyze everything they do.This book will probably help women who feel pressure to be perfect.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|it works just fine, I don't know what else to say. I use it together with my CANON DSLR for some video shooting. it's good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best game I pretty much ever played. It can teach you how to take care of a horse.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a fun app and it is wayyy different that the first temple run!!!! you should get it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it on kindle and there's some new updates like the 0.7.0 version but how do I get it there's like buckets and new crap on it
B006O7XOOW|1.0|All it dors is play music and push balls on the floor. My 8 mobth old baby stands up next to it, but it scares him when it pushes thr balls out. Doesnt do much. He likes the balls tho. Got as a gift, wud not reccomend, if i paid for it i would return it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Typical but fun anyway .Easy to read a no brained. Always knew how it would end and how it would get there.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good fun, different as it require more thought than speed.  I don't like some of the games that require fast actions to score points.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Other than the costumes, I thought this movie was way overrated.  Would not recommend it.  I did feel Jude Law was outstanding and I'm not a huge fan of him.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|While the story line may pretty simple, Washington made it worth watching. The story of an addict is not a new one, but the message is still important.
B001L5VYFI|4.0|I first bought this double-LP my freshman year in college. It was compiled from five shows in the summer of 1970 from the Filmore East in New York, the Chicago Auditorium and the Forum in Los Angeles.<br /><br />While i thoroughly enjoyed CSN's debut, I've always felt they were at their best with  the mercurial Neil Young in tow. That's what makes 4 WAY STREET one of their most enjoyable albums. Sure, they include a lot of material from their individual solo careers (including hits like Graham Nash's \\"Chicago\\" and Stephen Stills' \\"Love the One You're With\\"), but like any great band they were greater than the sum of their individual parts. Listen to the interplay between Stills and Young on the 14-minute \\"Carry On\\" or the vocal harmonies on the acoustic \\"Find the Cost of Freedom.\\" When the band was in sync, they were magical.<br /><br />In addition, the original vinyl release has been expanded from 76 minutes to nearly 110 minutes. Granted, about ten of those 34 minutes are simply extended between-songs patter and applause. However, the original release had only seventeen tracks; there are now twenty-one. The added tracks include \\"King Midas in Reverse,\\" one of the final singles by the Hollies before Nash left the band; David Crosby's \\"Laughing,\\" which would later turn up on the Byrds' reunion album; Stills' \\"Black Queen,\\" which finally appeared in studio form on 1991's CSN box set; and the Neil Young medley \\"The Loner/Cinnamon Girl/Down by the River.\\"<br /><br />Even if you own all of their studio albums, 4 WAY STREET belongs in every fan's collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|If you're in the mood for a shoot-em-up this movie will fit the bill.  Not the best acting but who needs acting when you have good fight scenes and special effects.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A colleague told me about this book.  I picked it up on line (kindle).  I couldn't put it down until I was finished.  Great read and makes you proud to be an American
B008Y73940|4.0|This did not go where I expected it to go....  overall good movie!  Matthew McConaughey can act and this movie proves it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Too many ads even if it is free. I don't mind ads, but not ever 3 rounds. It's too much.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It fell apart within a week!!! The rubber lining fell out and the screen popped out of the case. Didn't even last.. Sad day
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Unbelievable game play and strategy. Lots of soldiers and vehicles. There are many buildings to get you money and oil. The campaign is fantastic fighting against  Korea. Also the multiplayer is great.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app giving me the ability to buy books and download from amazon without having a kindle.. THanks so much for this..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever. When you go online and look a the scores it makes you want say OH...THATS NOTHING I CAN BEAT THAT. So it gives you that challenge. Then the next thing you know. BooYa you did it
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Love her music, though the material is getting kind of old, but she never lets me down lyrically. Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome my family loves playing it all the time.<br />They get a laugh at the big cop trying to catch up with them.lol
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Top 3 Bond movie of all time! Fantastic! Good storyline and even better action. I would buy this one for an action movie collection.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is great. large numbers, easy to use features, and is just like the calculator you would pick up from your desk!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is such a good game. I love this game because it comes in handy on long car/road trips.
B006DJ2JSI|2.0|why do you need a warning of impending violation of your privacy! this works but at what price. just because it is free should not mean you give away your privacy!
B0012GMVXU|5.0|Leonard Cohen doesn't make anything but excellent music. This is classic stuff by the master.  I'm adding to my collection.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|it was great! but I went through it in 4 days. took 6 more to get all three stars on all levels.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Absolutely loved the real world of small town Brit at the turn of the century. Real people, real problems, heart strong actions of a community helping each other make it through life.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Who ever cast Tom cruise as jack reacher can't read. Cruise playing reacher is like Ben the rat playing dumbo.

B007REV4T8|5.0|I thought it was a very good adaptation of the new Bond with a mix of the Sean Connery era Bond! My husband & I enjoyed it greatly!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Easy to read and a great tale of one of America's Heroes. Vivid details of his personal and professional career takes you into the life of a Seal Sniper.<br /><br />He will be missed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son is 3 almost 4 and doesn't get all the concepts yet but im sure he will here soon.  That being said i love the game and i love the show so i guess at the end of the day i got this for me and when my son gets my kindle in 2 years it will be there for him.
B00A6I87UQ|4.0|The kindle version is not quite as handy as the printed version, which is much easier to flip through to the needed chart.  It would be awesome to be able to print out the page you need for observing that night.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Lets be honest, im a guy who likes to watch things blow up... that being said beginning and end of this movie are excellent, The middle for me dragged just a little bit and became, expected.....  Now that being said the ending blew me away with the unexpected ending that in retrospect maybe i should of saw coming but I didn't think they would actually do.
0553381407|5.0|Classic in a realm of psychology. I value this author for Emotional Blackmail the most. But this book is not worse. Believe me.<br /><br />If you want to understand your life, your way of thinking, your present relations with your spouse, friends, work colleagues and the mostly with yourself, you must read this book. I will never forget some lessons given by Susan. It had had a huge influence on my life. It can free you from unnecessary fear of your own parents who can still tell you, how you must live, whom you must love, how you should raise your own children and so on. I remember how many people in their thirties, forties and even fifties are still led by their parents EVEN AFTER THEIR DEATH. Unbelievable but true. No doubt. This book deserves 5 stars.
B009LRE040|4.0|Here is the deal, The Dark Knight was, i feel, the best movie in 10 years.  It was well thought out, acted well, and visually stunning.<br /><br />Now that being said I expected this film to end up like Return of the Jedi, a okay movie that wrapped up everything in a nice bow, and ewoks.  I have to say i was really surprised at this ending, so much so that this three set of movies along with Batman Begins may be my new favorite trilogy of movies.  While not as mind blowing as The Dark Knight was for me, I have absolutely no issues how this movie ended and honestly I loved the last few scenes the most.<br /><br />If you saw the other two you have to see this no matter what everything you read says.
B004EPZ070|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Story is nice. Nice chick flick movie to watch with friends. it is a good movie. .
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great game but it does not work if you have facebook app installed. Its fun but slow money gain wish it was a bit more active.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|Lee Marvin is Lee Marvin. Great acting by Lee Marvin and Jack Palance. Good DP director William A. Fraker. Classic Marvin picture, Great score by John Barry. See it and enjoy it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I believe this is one of best series I've watched so far. If your a J Abrams fan then you HAVE to invest your time in this. I am only 3/4 of the way through season 1 and I'm already contemplating getting Amazon Prime just to watch all of the rest. Whoever picked the cast did a great job with drama, thriller, action and well placed humor.
B003O86FMW|5.0|literally could not put this down!! If you don't read the entire series you are definitely missing out of something special.
B001224WBS|5.0|Given how many albums Depeche Mode has come out with, you sometimes need a product like this, especially when you are not a long-time fan.It is a good introduction into DM's music--plus points for balancing the early-DM industrial, 80s excess songs as with the subsequent dark music that has defined the band.But it could have done better by including 'Stripped' and 'Policy of Truth' (not this song? Really?)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  Nicholas Sparks always leaves me feeling good at the end of his books with his romance but this particular book had suspense as well.  Its definitely the best one I've read so far! ps. the movie was great too, but of course it veered from the book quite a bit, however it was still very well done:)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I. like g5 games. they are fun and easy to play. dark arcana is good. it would be better if u could just buy the game first instead of getting the free version. first.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|literally could NOT put this book down.  If you dont read this entire series you are definitely missing out on something special.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is one of the best literatures I have ever read. I highly recommend you read it. Heartbreaking. Life-changing. That's life!
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I love it. People pay $4 at Starbucks for a lousy cup of coffee and a muffin and think nothing of it. Yet, they pay the same to watch a movie online, then get bent out of shape when it's a piece of junk. Get over it. For $4, Sinister was OK.
0684824906|5.0|Reads like a novel, keeps you riveted, and chock full of facts I'm sure hardly anyone knows.  My only disappointment was that the book arrived more than a week after Christmas, but that's what I get for ordering at the last minute.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|AWESOME!!! this is what the world needs more love songs. He has feeling in every word he sings. Totally awesome!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|My game was working fine one minute and now it is like another town developed on top of mine. Land that I had once purchased and placed buildings on are inaccessible. I have duplicate buildings and some buildings are sitting on top of one another and I can't move them because there is not enough room. I was told to wait for the update, but who knows when that will be!
B004MNO0BQ|2.0|I remember playing this when I was young. But, it seemed a little more exciting. Play is basic. A little sluggish. After a while I was ready to move on. Had I known I wouldn't have spent the money.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I was expecting this to break a week, but it didn't. It is a great buy. If you are looking for a pair of headphones that cost less than $15. This is what you need to buy. Also, the wire was longer than what I was expecting. It was a little over five feet long. This is great for me since, I like to plug it into my TV and use it as gaming stereo. The sound of it is also great for a $15 headphone.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Lots of features not found in the free app.  You'll be glad you bought it. This one keeps track of your time performance and is free of advertising.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Although the author has depicted characters that reflect personality flaws we all have I found it difficult and tedious to get through the book.  It wasn't one that you couldn't put down and one that didn't call me back to read more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a pretty good game if one likes horses. It has great graphics in my opinion that aren't terribly 'toony '. Interactive and more Realistic (except the unicorns of course)
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|First off - is it possible to practice law without a law degree or even pass the bar without one? - NO! So if anyone is getting any ideas from Mike Ross - please wake up and get off the couch and go get a degree.<br /><br />Other than that fictional situation this is a fantastic show - it has great production values and if not the best writing then close enough. I liked the 2nd season better than the first one, because it kind of took the superhuman (or super attorney) stature of all the characters, especially Harvey Specter and rather than focusing on individual cases it was an all out episode focusing on saving the firm and their jobs.<br /><br />So IMO this show deserves 5 stars, I am waiting for Season 3.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Loved this story and couldn't put it down even though I knew the ending would be sad.  Thought the author did an excellent job in getting inside Alice's head as she sank to the low state of Alzheimers.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had really been looking forward to reading this book. Although it is full of twists and turns, it failed to keep me wanting more. There were times that the story seemed to drag and I found myself just wanting to get through it some could start another book. I was disappointed in how it all came together in the end.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|If you're looking for a good Halloween movie to share with the whole family, this one is it.  Not scary enough to give the littles nightmares, not lame enough to send the older kids (or mom and dad) running for the shelter of their bedrooms.  Funny and heartwarming.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Pretty fun. Would be very hard without hints. Finding objects in a &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; sort of screen does get tedious after a while. Still a lot of fun
B005DEQV9W|5.0|This book gives parents, teachers and child development specialists a very good understanding about how important the role of the primitive reflexes are to the foundations of our physical, emotional and cognitive development. The book gives easy to read explanations that makes sense as to why there are so many learning and developmental challenges and that there is a natural solution to help children and adults overcome their challenges using rhythmic movements.
0345803493|4.0|This book was exactly as expected and I would definitely recommend it along with the other two.  Entertaining and not Porn.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|IF YOU LIKE LIVE MUSIC THIS IS THE ONE.  AND IF YOU THINK THAT IS GOOD BUY THE DVD.  THE BEST LIVE MUSIC WITH THE BEST SINGERS AND PLAYERS.
0345803507|4.0|This book was exactly what I expected and it was very entertaining and certainly not porn.  I would recommend it.

B001NLKT60|5.0|Great suspense novel, characters are like no others and the trilogy is a must read for all.  Loved it, and couldn't wait to read the next book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game in the world when you want to now at least how much u want to play just text me on kik messengers learn more at tablet or kindle or iPod or iPhone or iPad  one of those would work so download.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|This movie does have entertaining moments. I was happy with the cast they chose, although I'm not sure how much the younger Lincoln actually looked anything like the real young Lincoln. If you are expecting a silly vampire film based on an interesting plot, that is what you will get from this movie. If you are a history buff like me and your family talks you into watching this movie like mine did, you will complain from beginning to end. Overall it was silly, relatively cheap entertainment that I wouldn't watch again, but I was actually happy in some twisted way that I got to see.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|When I first got this, I thought it would be a cheap app.<br />I was very wrong. The graphics are very much like the original slender.<br />Slenderman appears more often, unlike the original, where I have go get go page 5 for him to even appear. There are two levels, where the originial has only one.<br />There is this glitch where you randomly fallback through the ground though.<br />Other than that,best game ever.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I watched this movie with my kids last night, and it was the best children's movie I have seen in recent years. The plot is wonderful, the voices are so perfectly Scottish and the animation is so amazing I know I have to watch it again to pick up on all the things I missed the first time.<br /><br />The story this movie tells is so unique and refreshing. There is a lesson in this movie, but it is delivered in a gentle way that kids will both understand and appreciate. The movie also has a lot of humor and some total snort you laugh so hard moments that even parents will get a kick out of.<br /><br />I just can't get over how well this movie was made. It is incredible.<br />If I had to nominate a movie as the parent's choice of the year, this would be it for sure.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I am a very disorganized person. This calender allows me to look at my schedule in different views. I can right memos (like what to bring to the event or what to wear) and send reminders to myself so I never forget. The only challenge now is remembering to put events in my calender. :P<br />Only problem I've had is creating a week long event, like vacation. If this was possible I'd give 5 stars.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|No point to it just FUN to PLAY!  No point to it just FUN to PLAY  !No point to it just FUN to PLAY!

B00992CF6W|5.0|I was not the first one to download the app I was not the last either I wasn't sure about asking my dad for a 7.00 game but I did and boy was I happy I did I built 2 TNT towers in a minute.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is the best weather app I have used.  I highly recommend it for those who are frustrated with the big guy.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|I downloaded this app to use the hand writing. The apps available for journal and diaries are lacking. Even though I use this for its unintended purpose the app shines. If you use it for what it is intended, I think you'll be very happy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Despite some reviews complaining about the size of the writing area, I find it to be better than anything out there. It could be a little more precise.<br /><br />The ability to change color of ink<br />The ability to change paper<br />and perhaps the biggest Pro- the ability to turn your notes into PDFs!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Organization, but to be fair the name of the app is Notes, it's not meant to do the things that the journal apps offer. Despite that any piece of software can benefit from organization especially when it comes to text files.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this app. Especially for the price. Free!
1608871517|5.0|This book is worth every penny.  Big, wonderful photos - lots of them, fascinating history and insights.  Totally love it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book. Could not put it down. It helps a lot to think out of the box and Steve was a simple man.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Pink tells us how sales has changed in our information world and reminds us that we are all in sales, even if it's just selling our kids on behaving in a certain way or asking donations for a cause. Thorough research and calls to action make this an interesting and valuable read for anyone selling - and that's everyone.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Oh my.......what a limited vocabulary used by the heroine before, during, and after the big event. Does not rise to the level of heart pounding erotica.
B0095P3ULC|1.0|It's marginally better than the second of the series, with action sequences that border on coherent, but just a few minutes in it's already pointlessly foolish, and doesn't do much to redeem itself over the next few hours.  Big robots, smash smash smash.  Whatever.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|I'm one of the fans who rate Bon higher than Brian. Having said that, and even though I really think Brian is also a Rock legend, to see Bon Scott in Full HD, at the peak of his power as AC/DC's frontman and just a couple of months before passing, this really is as good as it gets. The concert is great, although there are a couple songs missing from the classics (TNT and Dirty deeds), you can't go wrong with this one if you are a fan. The package, with a nice metal box, also includes a DVD version of the same concert (with everything that comes in the Blu ray disc), a guitar pick, a little booklet and some pics from the tour. I pretty much have everything AC/DC and this one ranks as one of its finest. You won't regret buying this, trust me!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I had not fully considered the impact of my consumerism on my time or the environment.  Eliminating one item a day is a simple strategy.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Only thing I don't like is that it is going to be a long wait for season 5 to come out on DVD. Love this show!
B00BHMEALA|3.0|This film is based on a very compelling true story, yet the film itself only has moments of real suspense.  For most of the movie, Ben Affleck looks totally deadpan.  I assume he is trying to look like a CIA agent who does not want to blow his cover, but his demeanor is basically the same in every single scene.  There were better performances by his collaborators back home.  While I enjoyed learning the inside story about these 6 people, for the suspense and drama that took place surrounding the real story, this film could have done a better job of conveying that.  It left me kind of lukewarm.  Considering the big haul this film made in terms of awards, I think it was overrated.  When I really enjoy a movie, I can have fun watching it several times.  I'll only be seeing this one just the once.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In love this game. My friend recommended this to med and said that it was the best game ever.at first I thought it was cheesy but once you start to play it it gets addicting. Wonderful game and I would recommend it to anyone anytime. Thanks friend you know who you are who recommended this to me. Go SubwaySurfers
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Tiles are great and easy to read. I play for hours at a time. I don't like all the reshuffling. I mean after one play, really, then will reshuffle again. Gets on my nerves. Love trying to beat my times and trying to get stars. I have really enjoyed it. Great when you can't sleep at night. I take it in the car with me too,when i am not the one driving of course. Glad i got it. Just wish it would not reshuffle so much at the end.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game.  Really worth the download.  Fun for all ages and its great looking on the kindle fire HD.  It's a good brain workout.
B005J7K950|5.0|It is interesting that a film released more than 80 years ago can have such visual impact. I have always liked the score, and am glad Moroder's version of the film is finally available on DVD.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I can not get 'Angry Birds' to download on my Kindle fire.  Apps tells me it is already downloaded but game will not bootup to be able to play game. How do I correct this problem?  I have greatly enjoyed other game I downloaded and the convenience and size of my kindle fire.  If I could correct this problem I would definately recommend product to others.
B00ATPVA78|2.0|Let me start by saying I'm not hating on G5. You guys make. great. hos. and beautiful graphics in your action adventure. games that I buy a lot of. This one was too short for For the 5 bucks I paid for the full game which might I add was short. come on guys $5? @
0385344333|5.0|Another well done Jack Reacher novel. This one picks back up with current ongoing story line as Jack attempts to get to Virigina, but is side tracked with another incident. It is fast paced and contains a few surprises. Overall, a very good read.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|Good read.  Takes a while but gets very good.  Ends a little to quickly.  I might read the next ons I might not.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|This was a fun and subtle read.  The main character is endearing, as are the cultures imagined.  Cultural and social details stay with you.  It compares to Sword in the Stone in the way practical magic is used and taught.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Especially &#34;This is not a song, it's an Outburst&#34;<br />Describes the beginning of the end for Detroit, the end is close, now 40 years later today<br />Could be the song of many cities today<br />he's like a profit
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Well written script and well directed by Ben A. but certainly not the best film of the year. Would have been better if Clooney had played the CIA agent or someone other than Ben.<br /><br />Does contain some nice wit and is worth seeing.<br /><br />A bit too much praise for Carter who was the worst president since Harding.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I have read all of the original Percy Jackson books as well as the first two in this series.  They are all very well written and enjoyable to any age.  Mark of a Athena is the first book where all of the &#34;7&#34; come together and because of this it seemed a little less action packed.  In reality this is probably not true, it is more that the action is being spread out over a larger group of characters.  Since all 7 of the demigods are an important part of the series you need to spend time with each of them, but for me I felt like I wasn't getting to spend as much time with my old friends from the original series nor was a I really getting to know the new characters as much, and so it felt like the book moved a little bit slower.  The book had a good plot and an ending that leaves you waiting anxiously for the next installment.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is an excellent show that I found it fast pace and well written.  I'm looking forward  to watching season two.
B000VYX8PE|3.0|I liked this book keeping in mind that it is for kids. I have read much more compelling books for kids though and this book didn't live up to the hype for me.
B00005QB42|5.0|Was here in time promised, I have been enjoying it ever since I got it.  New and works perfectly as expected. :)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The plot is a timely description of cyber warfare with the traditional Clancy characters. I don't care who is doing the actual writing because I couldn't put it down.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game was specifically for my husband to enjoy but he has trouble adding the next game after finishing one.
B00846F1YW|4.0|So the HO part of the game is great and just hard enough. I hate the easy HO then hard puzzles so I really love this game. The only reason it didn't get a five star was one minor and sometime easy to fix if you shrink the screen to get objects to close to the sides. BUT... the object are also placed behind the timer info bar at top of the game. So that being said I like it but get mad if I can't even see it!!!!
B0058O84G0|5.0|Ken Follet has the gift of taking you through history with very, very interesting characters, dialogs, life in general and slight pornography to spice the story.<br />My first contact with Folley was The key to Rebecca and I swallowed hook, sinker and line!!!
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Bruce's description of how a single cell's intelligence is mimicked by multi cell communities (i.e humans) takes the reader on a journey toward their own ability to change the fate he/she believes awaited them from the start.  Kudos to Bruce for keeping at these new discoveries about how humans can thrive and essentially evolve into the next generation.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It held me until we started her story and that was realy far-fetched and she wasn't an interesting character.  Poor baby.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Story brings the reader in and you want to see what happens.  Kept looking for hidden meaning.  Didn't find ant.
B005VPRDAY|4.0|I was very surprised at how small some of the pieces were but my niece is more responsible than her age so i believe it'll be fine. I loved that it came with a box to put them in to keep things tidy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun and cool. Cute little horses and unicorns ( which I love) make the game very very very very very fun!!!!! I love it so much!!!!!!!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I haven't tried the game yet but it took a really lo.g time to download so who ever gets this I'm just warni&ntilde;g u it might take long but it might not for you sooooooo just warning u
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed all 3 seasons.  W really have become invested in the characters.  They are so richly developed.  The storyline is excellent; the costuming, incredible.  Highly recommended
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|This is a great album by all means.<br /><br />It may have a few songs that are not so great, but all in all, Helloween seems to know their craft very well.  And why shouldn't they?  They have created amazing albums for soooo many years.  Helloween was one of my first Metal bands, I have their entire collection.  From Kiske to Deris and from Grapow to Sacha.  Somehow they keep coming with amazing albums, the guitar riffs are heavy and fast.  The melodies will be ringing your ears long time after your first listen.  Talking about first listens, this album will not be easy on a first try, but keep listening, and believe me - if you like Helloween, this album will not disappoint.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Half the time I stay up all night playing this game. I love it. I cant get enough of this game!
B0063IH60K|5.0|very easy to play.game moves when u tilt the screen so ur always playing.I love it! Try it and you'll love it to.

B002M9WW30|5.0|By now you know if you &#34;get&#34; the Rocky formula or not.  I do.  I love it. Plus I got the set for $20 on a deal of the day!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Really, it just doesn't get much better than this.A journey not to be taken lightly. Having seen the play, I decided to read the book instead of seeing the movie and I'm so glad. It has everything: beautiful language, history, characters you'll never forget, a moral tale, a love story, and tragedy, a joy. One of the best pieces of literature I've read. There's a reason this story is still popular today. I'll never go see the movie, but I know I'll read this book again. You won't be sorry.
0375842209|4.0|This is a good book and a great story. It didn't keep my attention the entire time and as a result I was slightly confused for a bit. But, that's not the books fault. This story opened my eyes to a world I couldn't imagine. I didn't breeze through it, but I'm certainly happy I read it. I would recommend this book to adults and teens. Give it a read.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|There was never another front man  like Freddie Mercury.  the performance is the main draw here, but the sound quality with the Blu-Ray and surround sound is wonderful for those of us who were not privileged to hear Freddie Mercury and Queen at the height of their powers.
B00785P2QC|5.0|you will be very happy with this game once you get the hang of it .I like the new stuff
B006WQLH7G|1.0|Okay so I went through all of the setup information (and my password that I set as my Kindle password so I wouldn't forget it) ,then I enter the password and the little read exclamation mark shows up and I'm like DUDE WHAT THE FLIP! Good app bad password security.
B000RLHDUM|1.0|Clever, but absolutely made for people in their 50s or older in order to be enjoyed. The main character (female) was horrible.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is the best app. I've tried as of yet. Easy to use, add to and Taylor to what you need doing.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|We've been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and...  you get the picture...  for this movie to come out on Amazon instant video!  It's finally available!  Without a doubt, the best movie Pixar has ever produced.  Period.
B009AP4MGE|4.0|Very heartfelt but just slightly over the top. I think the gay sex scenes with Blaine and Kurt were just a little too graphic for young kids to wath.
B000000XB9|4.0|Yeah, i never thoght about buying any of their songs but my wife heard them on the radio  several time and told me that she like<br />it so I bought it for her its become one of her favorites in the car.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite writers and he continues his craft with every book he writes.  This is a fantastic book!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very intense start but I like how the series is \\"mellowing out\\"  it makes it hard to put the books down cuz u can't wait to see what's next on the \\"agenda\\"
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is the second time I have purchased this musical score. The first one was a gift and they enjoyed it so much that I just had to have it for myself too! Listening to it envelopes me right into the Hobbit story.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book held my attention and always kept me guessing about the outcome.  You will enjoy the characters and the complicated plot.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|A beautiful record for the forthcoming Disney film. Inspirational and infectious lyrics sang with emotional conviction with luscious pop production from Carey and Stargate.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This couldn't be a more perfect ending for such an amazing saga. I am very sad that it has to end.
B00622BF40|5.0|I am so flat out enthused by this movie, I see it again and again. The grand ballroom scene opens with couples who are dressed to kill, out to win, no matter what. And a breakaway talent is displayed, by one man who wants to dance his own steps.<br />He finds a complimentary partner where least expected. He gives her the confidence to preform, she gives him, through the time he spends with her family, the sense of rhythm he lacks. Together they do a final Latin dance at the Grand Prix Pacific dance competition. The powers that be try to stop them by stopping the music, as new steps are not allowed. The beat of the music is provided by the audience, and then the dance finishes with a flourish and an invitation to the audience to join them.<br />Always a pleasure to watch. Great dancing, and a great message about dance and what it can convey to you.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I never thought i would like DA, but I am a huge fan. I think a lot of people see the show at first and think it looks slow and boring. It is not! There is a huge amount of dramatic interaction, family politics and even some believable type action. Watch 2-3 episodes and give it a shot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It would have been even better if it was like the pc game of horsez, otherwise it was great!<br />L
B004H0M8EA|5.0|very insightful and a bit scary.An easy read.  I especially liked the chapter on Chine.  This may change the way people look at products from other countries.
B003E8P9G0|3.0|I like this author for other collections, but the was not my fav. Mostly because I love Greek mythology. I enjoys his roman based books as well. The book is well written, it just wasn't my subject
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great app and works perfectly for the Kindle Fire with no freezes or glitches so far!<br />For anyone looking for a fun and free game that's child friendly, you've found it
B004FPZ2KY|5.0|To read Jane Austen's articulation of the English language is an experience.  This book reveals a good picture of English country living among the genteel.  It is humorous with a touch of seriousness.  I had previously read this book but as with all good classics, it is worth reading again. Kindle books are the way to go.  So accessible and convenient.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like the alarm clock extreme free.  Its looks overwelming with all the options but not hard to figure out.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Like so many others I always have been a James bond fan, and Daniel Craig makes a good bond character however, despite the awesome chase scenes I found the rest of the movie to be a bit slow.  Just my opinion...still worth a look!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|One of the better pinball games I found to download for free.  Its simple and entertaining. I enjoy playing the game
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|love the history and  humor in the show.  Wish I didn't have to wait a year for the 4th season to be available!

0765325950|5.0|I'm about halfway through and there are some parts I love and others that make me cringe inside.  I can tell when Jordan's notes/writings are being used and when they are not.  Sometimes characters will say things out loud that normally they would just think it or imply it with a look.  So sometimes it feels like one of the old books and other times it feels like its being written for grade schoolers.<br /><br />But it is here and normally when an author dies you don't get anymore books, so I for one, am thankful for having it. It will generate some great conversations and memories throughout the years to come.
B009GFEOY8|3.0|I'm only rating this a 3 star because I'm not sure if it's the camera or the films that are bad.<br />When I take a picture the picture comes out blank and stays that way.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|The first couple of chapters walk the reader through basic brewing procedures and you can be up and confidently brewing extract and partial mash recipes in a matter of a few hours.<br /><br />The later chapters get more technical and I really appreciated the places where the author cites research in order to back up his statements.  Brewing is an old practice and there is still a fair amount of superstition surrounding some processes; the author has made a respectable effort to dispel some of those superstitions.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series and Amazon Prime Membership allows me to watch it as much as I like!<br /><br />It's a wonderfully dramatic series about a family in turmoil over the future of the home Downton Abbey. It follows the lives of all of the family members as well as the servants to give everyone's perspective.
0143038419|5.0|What a delightful, insightful book to read from an adventurist lady with some keen metaphysical observations about life,  She conveyed the ashram experience with great understanding.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's story is compelling. He should either be dead or be in a \\"persistent vegetative state.\\" His story is remarkable both for its medical odyssey and for his personal view of an afterlife that at times rhymes with elements of other NDE's but is also at odds with most recollections on some points. I have reread this book and it glows with the authenticity of someone who has experienced the inexpressible and is trying to find metaphors and words on this side of eternity for experiences that beggar description. It reminds me of reading Flatland, a world where two dimensional beings find the third dimension incomprehensible. Dr. Alexander emerges from his view of eternity with a message that love is transcendent and our connections to each other far more profound than we know. He has stirred up a hornet's nest in the scientific community and that reaction is reminiscent of the observation by Pascal \\"that there is enough light for those who wish to see and sufficient darkness for those who wish to remain blind.\\"
B000JO9JHW|4.0|For years I had heard Dexter  was a great show so I decided to give it a try.  I'm hooked!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I find this game relaxing and doesn't require a lot of thinking.  Fun and addicting.  Like I'll just play a little longer
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Love the deal!!! Love the show best series ever. Keep watching it. It gets better every time. Great acting also
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is fun until it wants you to buy something.  Nobody wants to be bothered with that stuff. You play these games for fun.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was boring and a total waste of my time and money.  I would not recommend it at all!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Great for keeping in touch. I'd give it a 5 except when typing text the text area and font are way too small in some apps.
B008K93302|1.0|useless app for flahplyer need on webpages<br />wasting of money evenits just a dollar<br />amazon zhould stop such apps to be available,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I think that this book is the best yet from Nicholas Sparks. It's a plausible story line. This is by far my favorite book from him. The characters are so dynamic and you can just picture the story in your head. I have to say though I watched the movie after and it is not the same. There are some key things off but it a good movie besides that.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love reading John Grisham books.  This was no exception.  I did get a little confused by a change in direction in the middle of the book but everything was resolved by the end.  If you are a Grisham fan, this will not disappoint.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a simple game that is very addictive, when I am waiting for a flight, or at the doctors office I pull out my Kindle and I can't stop!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|this was a gift for my wife. she loves the movie and was a surprise for xmas. quality is ok
B000VYX8PE|4.0|It was amusing and mysterious just the way i like it.<br />Sometimes i want to read or buy all the series.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|big fan of tom clancy read all of his novels. same theme next episode, this time ryan jr has a role
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|The movie shows beautiful people enjoying sex. Unless you read the book it is impossible to appreciate the plot or the setting.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Have a friend who wanted this because he likes making home movies and is interested in making movies for his family
B00992CF6W|1.0|Multiplayer only works on local wifi networks.  No minecraft servers.  So if you want to play solo or with your buddy in the other room, okay.  Probably waste of seven bucks for me.  I was buying it for my son to use with the kindle fire HD.  I was fooled by the 5000 great reviews.  And the controls are all different and touch screen view control must take some getting used to.  Btw Amazon does not refund any downloaded software, which will make me think twice next time I download a possibly crummy app, even though I made sure I did some looking and made sure it worked well with the Android 4.0 on my tablet.  How come this tablet can't do what a crummy comparably priced netbook can do?  I guess cuz it's not a real computer.  At least it's good for reading books and watching Netflix.  It should say, \\"partially functional pocket version\\".  I expected some scale-down, but no multiplayer?
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book was just as good as the other two in the series. What a great way to end the story!
B008ALA6DW|2.0|The adapter works just fine if you are using OSX all the time.  If you bootcamp into windows, the thunderbolt port is not hotswapable.  So this means if you unplug it you have to reboot your compter for it to see the adapter again.  On my MBP my wireless would not work once I unpluged the adapter forcing a reboot just to get internet.  So bottom line, if you use bootcamp, get a usb 3.0 to ethernet adapter.
B008Y212PI|5.0|a great game. easy to use the touch screen.  lots of games and you can the difficulty<br />.  it is fun to play for a minute or an hour. i love that
B00BESLHEA|1.0|This \\"movie\\" was so bad I had to quit watching. I'm amazed that Russel Crowe and Lucy Liu took money to appear in it. Please don't waste your time or money in viewing this crap.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Love this movie, had to purchase a new one because our daughter broke the last one.  The DVD came quickly and was in good condition.
B00BESM14U|5.0|With the latest teen angst and romance flicks being filled with nothing but meaningless drama, the Perks of Being a Wallflower gives us drama with a purpose.<br />A young man tormented by not only his mind, but teenage cruelty gets what is the only cure to surviving in this cruel world...friendship.<br />Not since the Breakfast Club has someone been able to truly express what was then and currently is now the challenge we all have to face.<br />If you've ever felt singled out, stepped on, picked on, or treated like a freak, then this is your movie to see that there is light at the end of the tunnel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game. I got this game because I am in love with horses I highly recommend it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Well put together, just enough turns in the story to keep one guessing. This was right up there with the best of Mitch Rapp.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|great movie. strong, dramatic. different insight on addiction. never boring. must watch if you like personal stories. denzel did an amazing job.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Some crisp scenes, like the meeting in the diner, interesting plot devices like the shotguns in a sci-fi movie, parental lessons doses for young folks, and a typical \\"What do we do now?\\" Sci-fi ending. Thoroughly entertaining. Rent it, it is not a classic.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|i can watch this movie over and over. the story was just right. can be a little corny at times.
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|Let's start with the brilliant casting. Daniel Day-Lewis's turn as our sixteenth president is simply magnificent. Throughout the whole movie the viewer completely buys Day-Lewis's vision of Lincoln. Never once is the audience jarred from the movie back to real life by a moment of Day-Lewis's acting. I can't say enough about how he brought Lincoln to life. Sally Fields also did an exceptional job portraying Mary Todd Lincoln and the many demons she wrestled with while in the White House.<br /><br />The movie itself is good, but drags. I enjoy the political machinations that go on behind the scenes while trying to get any controversial bill passed - much less something as important as a Constitutional amendment outlawing slavery! - as much as anyone, but I still thought the movie was too slow. Purely personal taste, but to me this is just one of those movies I really have to be in a certain mood to watch from start to finish in one sitting.<br /><br />I did love the history behind the movie and applaud Spielberg for tackling such a weighty subject without taking too much liberty with the facts. I believe he performed a mighty service by preserving Lincoln's dedication to the anti-slavery cause on film, especially how Lincoln proceeded with a deadly war even while reconciliation with the South was possible if he had simply relented and allowed slavery to continue in the Southern states in a postwar union.<br /><br />More things to like: Lincoln's shrewd political maneuvering even as he appeared to be little more than a folksy charmer on the outside. The portrayal of 19th century lobbyists. Even back then they were sleazy! Again, really good movie just a bit slow.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Although this game gets pretty fast paced and difficult pretty fast, I think it's just as fun and just as addicting as the original Missile Command from back in the day.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I like flying in creative mode but only lets you play for 15 minutes their are not even any creepers just my opinion though.
B0091JQH76|5.0|I am a lover of Poulenc's music, and was delighted to find all of it together. The recordings are all high quality, with some stellar performances.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I prefer this FB app over the one that came on kindle. A big plus it's that I am able  check out links and photos with out loosing my scroll spot on news news feed . Over all I have had no problems and highly recommend trying . I have used on both 1st and 2nd generation Kindle . It seems to me most of the complaints are  coming from 6 months plus ago so maybe they have since fixed
0938045768|5.0|It's somewhat overly bold and cliche to say \\"This book will change your life,\\" but this book really will change your life.  If you apply the principles in this book, you will never need to buy another weight, spend another dollar on gym equipment or gym fees, or complain that you don't have the time or space to workout today.  Paul Wade (assuming he actually exists, which I don't think he does) demonstrates a number of principles that take the centuries-old technique of \\"body-weight training\\" and puts it into a systematic fashion designed for growth.<br /><br />Wade takes six exercises (or power moves) and gently walks the trainee through each of them.  For example, the goal for working out the back is obviously pull ups, and the super move is \\"one-handed pull ups.\\"  Few humans can do that, so Wade starts you off at \\"baby moves\\" and once you complete a certain progression standard (x sets at y number of reps) you go to the next phase (labeled 1-6).  This takes time and the willingness to fail.  Most people who have some strength training experience can usually start off at phase  3 or 5.<br /><br />His technique \\"works,\\" plain and simple (though I have some problems with some of his suggestions, which I will list below).  Body-weight training makes the body move against resistance in exactly the way God designed it to work.  As a result, you got stronger at a faster rate.  But you don't simply get \\"stronger\\" or \\"bigger muscles,\\" though that certainly happens.  Because you are training in a way that the greatest athletes and warriors have trained for the past five thousand years, you also grow in joint strength, tendon strength and even neurological strength (your nervous system will get stronger on the \\"bridge\\" and \\"stomach\\" workouts.  You are forcing your mind to work in harmony with your body on moves that you really do not believe are possible, buy you to do them anyway).  Weight lifting can only give you a fraction of that kind of strength.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Even the most insane workout regimen in this book can be completed in under thirty minutes and most under fifteen.  For example, I have decent stomach muscles but I never really worked out my \\"abs\\" because I got bored doing the \\"Arnold\\" workout (4 x 25 crunches).  Wade explains with body weight ab moves, you don't need to do an insane amount of reps.  A sufficient number will do because these moves will simultaneously work out the lower back, hips, and lower abs.  (Getting a \\"ripped\\" six pack has more to do with diet and aerobics than reps).<br /><br />For the first few months, bodyweight training has a \\"multiplier effect\\" on your strength.  Because each phase is categorically more difficult than the last, the body is forced to move to new heights.  Think about it:  if on week one you can barely do 5 reps of one-half handstand should presses, think of how strong (and muscled) you will be weeks later when you can do 2 sets of 20 reps of full handstand shoulder presses!  And he has a gentle, but consistent plan to get you there.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />I really have questions on his urging us to do one-arm chin ups.  Yes, it will mean you are insanely strong, but it also places an inordinate amount of strain on the forearms and for most people this will mean they have to lay off of workouts for a few weeks.  I really believe that one can get similar gains doing weighted chin ups (with a kettlebell; this way you don't have to touch a weight!) which will also build forearm strength and eventually allow you to do one arm chin ups.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />How will this book change your life?  Let's be honest:  the workout moves in this book are brutal.  After you have punished your body like this, why would you ruin what you have accomplished by going and gorging on junk food?  Even someone with modest discipline levels knows better than this?  Further, since you are lifting your body in these moves, you need to keep your weight under control.  See whatjust happened:  this is a cut-and-dry plan for losing weight, getting in shape, and gaining more energy without having to do a metrosexual workout plan or buying some snake oil product.just happened:  this is a cut-and-dry plan for losing weight, getting in shape, and gaining more energy without having to do a metrosexual workout plan or buying some snake oil product.
6305161992|5.0|My youngest wanted to watch this with me the other evening, but all I had was the VHS copy, and the VCR was packed away; so, after looking it up here, I ordered it.  Received it today, haven't had a chance to throw it in the magic machine yet, but visual inspection is VERY promising -- IT LOOKS *NEW*!  My thanks!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I never finished this book, because I just could not identify with the characters or the story. I very rarely become so disinterested with a book that I just stop reading it. Gone Girl is one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think its great because whenever I go to the store I know how much everything will be! not to complicated and not to easy!

B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love this game since I have the Bakery Story, and I also have a Dragon Story, and now the Hubbs has City Story.  Team Lava Rocks and for being free you can't beat it.  I don't like how much things do cost and like the bakery I am a little disappointed that when you have reached your limit on appliances it doesn't tell you what level you will unlock another one at.

B0011UJMK2|5.0|I am fascinated with Russian history and culture.  This story really captured the paranoia of a living in a totalitarian state.  And the ambiguities of being in a middle portion of the food chain.  Good visuals in words.

B007REV4T8|1.0|When I was a kid our family went to a wonderful restaurant for Thanksgiving.  They had great food and wonderful service despite the crowded dining room.  We came to expect that.  Then one year, after the restaurant was sold, we discovered to our dismay, that the new owner fired the experienced help replacing them with untrained kids whom he didn't have to pay as much and he went cheap on the quality of food and serving size also.  Needless to say, we never went back.<br /><br />The movie, Skyfall, reminded me of that experience.  You come to expect a specific genre of movie associated with a franchise as long-lived as this.  I expected gorgeous cinematography in colorful places, characters, both good and evil, that you remember years after the movie premier, each with a unique 'schtick' whether it's Oddjob's hat or Jaws' dental hardware.  Of course you've got to have beautiful women and enough innuendo to know the hero beds them all before moving on to the next one.  The hero exudes suave manliness without expending a lot of effort, not stiff like Mr. Craig.<br /><br />At least Skyfall got the action scenes down pretty well, the few that merited mention although some, like the fist fight atop the train, seemed to go on and on forever.  But what really disappointed me was the major transformation from the old Bond movies to the latest  ones.  The brooding Daniel Craig, with that childish pout makes you want to slap him upside the head and tell him to be a man.  He isn't helped by his supporting cast, many of whom looked like they did nothing more than punch the time clock and read the lines in the script.  Too many scenes were filmed in the dark which saves money on set costs I suppose.  How I miss the naturally lit Carribbean movie sets of yore.  The scene shot in the gloomy moors of Scotland sums this point up quite well I think.  Even the trademark opening credits were one of the worst efforts I can remember.<br /><br />However, if I were to point to one single thing above all else that distances Skyfall from the other Bond movies; it is the sound track.  Instead of the trademark crisp, snappy theme music we have come to expect, we are instead subjected to morose, forgettable background sounds...or no music at all; just silence.  I found myself working on a crossword puzzle during such long, drawn out scenes.<br /><br />If the producer and directors' idea was to remake the James Bond image with more mediocre dialogue sprinkled with a few brief bouts of fast action (to get the younger audience to stop texting), they should change the name of the movie to something more appropriate; like, 'Melvin Pervis: 008\\".  To be politically correct, give him an even more effeminant character...\\"I'll have a fruity frappuchino, my good man, shaken not stirred.\\"<br /><br />In summary, I feel this movie is a great disappointment that would not belong in their \\"50-years of Bond\\" collection.  If they keep it up, the second \\"50-years\\" collection will only have one or two movies in it.  Like the restaurant owner I mentioned earlier, in the process of trying to expand their audience with fewer bells and whistles and a less manly fare, the current producers are finding that, at least this Bond movie fan, has exited the building. It's not just me, my wife was disappointed also.  Goodbye Bond, hello Pervis...that's Melvin Pervis.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very interesting and addresses all those issues you think of regarding time travel. Not a typical Stephen King book. I wish there were more like it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|great game.  very similar to first game. some fun additions.  challenging and addictive.  just like old school arcade games. sometimes gets slow on kindle.
B00AJLHUA8|2.0|After seeing Insidious we had figured that this movie would be equally good considering the trailer made us jump. However after seeing it we quickly realized that we shouldve rented it instead of buying it. Honestly i think i wouldve had a better time watching a Paranormal Activity marathon.
0887306101|5.0|It's not perfect, but it's easily the best book about investing I've come across, well that's my current opinion. I finished it a few days ago. I'm not the most avid reader, when I find a book I read from cover to cover in a short time, it's a relative rarity, but this is one. I marked up the book a lot because I expect to reread it multiple times, I want the lessons to sink in and stick (I trade, stocks exclusively currently).<br /><br />I'm reading New Market Wizards now, and I'm not finding it as compelling as it's predecessor, however it is holding my attention. Both are hardcover, bought in December 2011 at Amazon. The publisher is the same, although they indicate different home cities. What's surprising is the difference in the quality of the printing. The first book is very peculiar in its printing, sometimes it's off, not terribly clear, but still readable. It almost looks like it was desktop published on a cheap printer. It's inconsistent. The two books are amazingly different in the quality of print on the page. However, New Market Wizards' printing is professional and consistent to the point of being mechanical. It's perfect, but I have to say I think I actually prefer the the printing in my hardbound copy of Market Wizards.<br /><br />Jack Schwager is very knowledgeable concerning the world of investing. The questions he asks the interviewees are often sophisticated and complex. I feel that he sometimes fails to keep from injecting some of himself into the discussions, but by and large he's very successful in his role as an interviewer and commentator (he injects his own comments and explanations at times into and after the interviews). There is a glossary of investment terms at the end of the book, so if you read the book, be aware of that from the start. I was not, however I already knew most all of the terms.<br /><br />For the person who's interested in trading any markets I'd say this is required reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I truly enjoyed the Wool 1-5 series. I was sad every time I had to put down my Kindle and stop reading! This is a story about the human spirit and our struggle to survive despite seemingly insurmountable odds. The characters were intriguing and I can hardly wait for the next story to come out! Bravo Mr. Howey!!
B00BESM14U|4.0|A film with a lot of heart and teenage angst that will appeal to both teens and adults. I thought Emma Watson fulfilled her role and may have a future as a adult past Harry Potter fame. A number of well known stars put in small roles which I hope means they believed in the movie. Reminds me of John Hughes films that has been updated to the present time. You will not be wasting your time seeing this film!
B000W94FE6|5.0|Extremely well written, thoughtful, intelligent...This book leads from initially simple concepts related to finding happiness at work, towards more and more complex questions of human existence. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to improve his/her life and reach a higher level of understanding human conscience.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I love all the Bond movies...but I think Daniel Craig is going to top them all. Yes! even Sean Connery.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was so sweet.  A great love story with suspense towards the end.  The perfect book to read while u sip your morning coffee or relax on a park bench!
B00005R2IS|3.0|If you are a fan of this movie, this is fun to watch because you can see the original cut with the original audio.  However, the quality was not updated and, overall, this is a very basic DVD.  If you are looking for a special edition, this really isn't that special.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Fast paced action packed movie with a few twists and turns.  Makes you think you know who &#34;done&#34; it, then takes a whole new direction.
B008Y6SGC6|4.0|This was a nice and entertaining movie. I really enjoyed it. Not to heavy of a plot. Easy to follow.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Had a difficult time sitting thru this entire movie.  Moved very slowly and there won't be any Academy Awards for the acting.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I was behind on my tv watching and missed out when this season started, but on the recommendation of friends I watched and now I understand what all the buzz is about!  What a GREAT show!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A fantastic love story with a well crafted ending. It kept my attention throughout, I just could not put the book down!
B002WJI65S|1.0|I am a Mario fan I love plushes. I have never seen Goomba sold in Game stores like Gamestop or Walmart.  I thought having Goomba would be cool instead of having Mario (because Mario is popular). I opened the Box and it was in a plastic bag...<br />My impression was ...disgusted. I looked at the things face and thought he didn't look angry, he looked puzzled. I've uploaded 2 pictures. The eyebrows were wrong, the lines in between his eyes are wrong, he's skin tone is lighter than the picture, also his feet are away from his main body.<br />So disappointed, do not get your hopes up when you buy this product. I'm probably going to request a refund.<br />Very unhappy, was looking forward to have that on my 'geek' shelf.
B003DZX3US|4.0|This was a good way to buy a disney movie and save money. I like the fact that the purchase of the movie benefits Goodwill Industies. The movie did not have the Blue-Ray version in the case. I only recived the DVD and special edtion disk. But for the price that is alright. My 3 year old nephew is now pretending to be the beast. It us nice to own these disney classisc movis.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Loved the personal story of this dedicated soldier. Did not appreciate the profanity. Am grateful for men and women that put their life on the line for America and for our freedoms.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is gr8 cuz when i was playing games like TR2 i did not know what percentage battery there was until battery HD. it was very helpful and now i do not need to guess how much percent of battery there is
B000JMKQX0|4.0|In essence a collection of vignettes.  Not sure how a coherent movie can be made that is true to book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was an amazing look into the life of an American Hero. I pray his soul is at rest in Heaven. God Bless the damn few!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Masterpiece Classic  and this series.  Maggie Smith is wonderful in everything she does.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is in the rotation of favorites that keep me happy during commercials of the shows I like, and the shows my husband likes that I don't.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great character development throughout. The three main plots of ASOIAF are woven together brilliantly; King 's Landing and the war in Westeros by countless families fighting for the Iron Throne, The Wall and The Nights Watch storyline  protecting the realm from the far north, and Daenerys and her dragons far off in Essos rallying troops for their attempt to take back her father's throne. Very well done.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this version. All the actors are at their best! There's humor and tehre drama. Very very good version!
B00571F26Y|3.0|The book is very informative. I haven't eaten wheat since I read it. But the book is very repetitive from chapter to chapter.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is THE best Bond out of all of them!!! Didn't think any could beat Casino Royale, but Skyfall did!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|If you are a fan of any kind of solitaire you will enjoy this game.  You can start off playing with just one deck and as you get better at the game can increase your challenge to two, three or four decks.  Certainly keeps one busy!!!
B00B7XGFO4|5.0|I think this is a good version. It is my third and they are all different. Very good acting and directing.
B00846REIS|5.0|Well written book and I've already purchased book number two.  Day is an awesome writer ads I enjoyed the details she put into this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this apps so much it looks so reallostic and the movement on it is just amazing plus if u r an animal lover u would flip over this and trust me u deginatly want to listen to me because, I speak the truth and I am really professional of what I put and how I love this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if I had to choose between temple run and temple run 2 I would pick temple;run 2!!!! I love the ziplines !
B0091REZMW|4.0|Takes a while to get started, can be addicting, energy runs out to quickly. Graphics are great. The zoom feature is cool but it blurs each time.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Without the expert guidance and step by step directions, i would never have been able to convert my published novels from hard cover to kindle. Summation? I will recommend it to anybody interested in reader publication.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Everything in Harry's life has led to this!!! The ultimate confrontation!!! The second part of the two-part finale to the greatest film series of all time based on the bestselling book series. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2<br /><br />Picking up where Deathly Hallows Part 1 left off, this film put me into the final half of the story. And when we find Hogwarts, it has fallen into Voldemort's evil hands with Professor Snape as the new headmaster. And we find Harry and company still hunting Horcruxes at Shell Cottage and Gringotts in Diagon Alley. And after an escape ride on a dragon, they return to Hogwarts for the ultimate climatic showdown. And from that moment on to the very end, it's the Hogwarts residents vs. Dementors, Acromantula, giants and Death Eaters.<br /><br />And the final battle at the very end of the movie was exactly how I wanted it to be. Voldemort vs. Harry through Hogwarts (the Great Hall in the book) with them flying on the outside. And when they clashed wands for the final time (first time on Goblet of Fire), I wanted it to go out with a bang!! And my wish was granted.<br /><br />Through the dramatic deaths, the incredible action sequences, and the mayhem this movie gives the Harry Potter franchise at the end it deserves.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray movie picks up right where Deathly Hallows Part 1 left off and it puts you in when you watch it.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I am a big Doctor Who fan and I absolutely had to have this set to complete my series.  Of course it was of supurb quality and I enjoy looking at past episodes.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It's here. The team-up consisting of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and the Incredible Hulk under the watchful eyes of S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury that squares off against the evil schemes of Thor's villainous brother Loki is the best team-up film of all time. This film follows up to the story that is told in all the individual films before starting with 2008's Iron Man has finally come to this, where we see a bunch of old faces and a few newcomers to the Avengers franchise. When I heard that Marvel was making The Avengers, I thought that Edward Norton would return as the Hulk, but that little thing left me to feel disappointed. On a lighter note, Mark Ruffalo stepped in as the Hulk and has done it so brilliantly, I want him to return to the role in The Avengers 2 and the next Hulk movie. And everyone is relatable in this film with a few key things about their individual lives (though Captain America was frozen in the 1940's after he became a superhero). And I was asking myself when this film was in development, 'Who is the villain going to be?' And my answer was Loki, who was played by Tom Hiddleston, who returned in a darker matter than in Thor. This DVD puts you into the world of the Avengers and is a great time for anyone who loves Iron Man, Thor, Captain America or the Hulk. A great time for everyone!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love, suspense and great story line ending the way the reader hopes it will end.  I couldn't put it down.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Fantastic - every bit as entertaining as series 1 and 2. Blue ray quality and extra features are worth the small price premium. Great value - have already added series 4 to my wish list.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love watching my little pony so once I saw it I had to get it . I can't believe that I can finally get some bits . Plus you can get all of your favorite ponies plus on the computer you should check out this game called animal jam
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Brand name from Canon does the job with supplying power to my 40d but actually, on future purchases I bought generic.  No difference but make sure you buy from a reputable seller (read the reviews)
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Switch is a simple, memorable template to help in leader in two things;<br />1. Preparing a new process, program, plan and being sure that the change has the highest chance of success<br />2. Analyzing a failed, stalled, or unpopular change to determine what facet is missing.<br />I use this book in working with school leaders all the time.  We are trying to &#34;switch&#34; the myth of failing schools to the reality of widespread success--and this book has great application.  Also recommend Made To Stick by the same authors.
1577314808|5.0|what The Power of Now is all about.  Learning from Oprah and reading this book added so much insight into how I perceive what's happening all around me.  We so often worry about the future...worry about what's next but in reality, you are experiencing a moment in your life, in time.  Focus on this moment and not what has yet to transpire.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|wonderful movie...I am a twilight fan...and believe me...the last moments will leave you begging for more...this is a little graphic, and i would not recommend young children to watch...for any of the twilight series to be honest...but this one even more so with the bones breaking etc. anyway...great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you will not be disappointed.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book, I loved it from the minute I started reading it. I read 4 chapters in an hour and couldn't stop. I can't wait till I start reading the second book. :)
1451695195|5.0|This is a plausible account of one human being's journey into the afterlife and back.  It is an easy read, yet it contains some vivid descriptions that must be thoughtfully taken in for the reader to achieve maximum appreciation.  I especially enjoyed the back and forth structure which is popular today to explain the two simultaneous sequences. The reader will discover what Dr. Alexander recalls of his experience during his time in a coma at the same time his family in the hospital was viewing the plight of their loved one.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|great cd, you must hear it to injoy the good music of pit bull. This cd will have you moving.
1607053888|5.0|The author has easy to understand instructions.  Wide range of items to sew and patterns to go with it.  highly recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an awesome book! So capturing! So sad at times and wonderful at other times! Great writing and great story! I'm a marriage and family therapist and this book is so perfect for my clients and life! It has really great advice and support and ideas all in a wonderful story!!! I loved this book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it think its fun and you get to learn how to take care of real horses yourself its very creative and educative.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|I thought that this series was going to be good when I watched a preview, but I did not realize how great it would turn out to be. I have to admit that when I first heard about this series, I thought to myself that Kevin Bacon was very ambitious in taking on a Television series, but I have to say the suspense and the mystery of this show keeps you always guessing who to trust. With every twist and turn of the plot, you have to wonder who is playing who.<br /><br />This is one of the best new dramas out there right now and I am glad I purchased the season pass.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Good movie.  Kept you on the edge of your seat!  As usual, Denzel Washington and John Goodman were great.  However, I am not looking forward to flying again in the near future!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Probably one of my favorite Daniel Craig Bond movies. I also like the Adele theme song very much. She most likely will ,or should ,  win a Grammy for this movie theme.<br /><br />The movie is great. I first saw it in IMAX and now watching the Blu-ray is just as stunning at home. I will not give to much away because a lot of people have not seen this, but the ending was very bittersweet for me, but I guess I could see this coming sooner or later.<br /><br />If you are a Bond fan than this is a must have for your collection. You will not be disappointed.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Once you start it is hard to put down.<br />Best book I have read in awhile.<br />You will love it.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|This was a great purchase at a great price. Too good of a deal to pass up.<br /><br />As a fan of George R. R. Martin's &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;  book series, I basically think that the Blu-ray series is very entertaining and follows the storyline very well. However, there are lots of details in the books that haven't been included because of the length and complexity of the books. If you have read and enjoyed the books, more than likely you will enjoy the Blu-ray collection and be very satisfied with your purchase.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|I got hooked on these guys about a year ago, and I really love their music, the rocking rhythms and the great banjo riffs.  What I can't figure out is how all the different band members can be doing different things at the same time and it come out so great!  Haven't watched the DVD yet, but I bet that is great, since Red Rocks is such a cool place.  Saw it in person, and wished it was night and a great group playing, but still impressive in the daytime!
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Although I disliked the writing style and diction, I am still reflecting on the strange idiosyncrasies  of the main character. My brother -in-law has a prenatal brain injury. This book gave me some insight into some of the things he does. For example, he talks very loud when I am saying what he does not want to hear. Now I have considered that he might want to fill his head with sounds he likes or sounds he can control so he can't hear sounds he does not like or sounds he has no control over.He also adds people's ages together or he'll start spelling words backwards and try to pronounce them. When I ask him why, he says he doesn't know. He can't help these thoughts. They just take control of his mind. His gift is historical trivia and music instead of math like Christopher. He compares and contrasts historical events and music data and can recall in an uncanny way names and dates with accuracy. But he has a very limited diet and can't stand pets. His talking is like stream of consciousness randomness incessantly. It was interesting to me to see so many resemblances  between the main character and my 69 year old brother-in-law.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good twists. Well-written. Started this on a flight and finished it a few days later. I am a read-in-bed-before-sleep person and this book was interesting enough that I picked it up a few mornings before I got up.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|i am a history buff as well as a movie fan. although this might have taken history out of context, yet i can say that the depiction of the roman time was more or less as it was. the action, the acting, the story line, the dialogue were perfect!!!! i would give it a 10 stars if allowed!!!!!<br /><br />i liked andy as he carried the spartacus character so well and i was saddened when he died. liam has carried on perfectly and he is a good replacement.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I usually love the Pendergast books however this one was a little different.  However, I did like it and will continue to order this series.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|downton abbey is a masterpiece. however, it is quite upsetting to have some characters (matthew and sybill) built up to be loved by viewers and then, for purposes for other than the story, have them killed off. before the ending i and my family and friends could hardly wait for the 4th season.<br /><br />but now, it was an overwhelming consensus that viewing the 4th season, if there is any, would not be worth our time.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|enjoyed it.Good action adventure movie.Did not contain foul language nor unneeded sexual content.It shows this is not needed to make a good movie.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|this is one of the, if not the best movie ever made....in it's scope, its characters, it's settings, it's story development. i have been a movie enthusiast for 60 years and i could not remember any movie ever come equal to this.<br /><br />the movie transfer to blue-ray was outstanding.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoy reading different types of books but the book has to intrigue me for me to really get into it. I read this in 2 days, whenever I got a free moment to read I did. I thoroughly enjoyed that the book is from Katniss`s perspective so I could picture th  characters in my head easily.
B00BHAVRDG|5.0|I love me some zombies!  A show about zombie and zombie killing and zombies eating people?  That sounds like something I would like.  And you know what?  I do!
B0068THAGY|4.0|Castaways, alien invasion, and paranormal phenomenon are nothing new, but when they are re-imagined by J.J. Abrams, they sure seem that way. Like king midis, everything Abrams touches is pure gold and Super 8 is no exception. On the surface, the film seems like something you've seen a million times before, but it's Abrams twist, turns, and imagination that make it very different. What I loved about this film, was that it's a blockbuster film, with two major names behind it, and there wasn't any big stars attached to it. In fact, most of the cast never had a major role in anything, like the lead, Joel Courtney. I don't know how they found this kid. He had zero professional experience and he was really fantastic. This movie is a gem, and while it seems like it's been done, you've never seen it done J.J. Abrams way. Super 8 is an evolved version of many similar films behind it and is one that they will talking about for years.
B003H6KRIE|1.0|DVDs where damaged on arrival. Big long lines on all 3 discs. Causes the movie to skip and/or lack of sound. Made faulty.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|From the master of the modern day dark thriller, M. Night Shyamalan, comes Devil. Going into a Shyamalan movie, you know you're going to see a tragedy, a hero, and an amazing twist at the end. Coming off two absolute bombs, Shyamalan needed a good film to get back on track, and Devil is it! This is one of those movies that's hard to describe without giving stuff away, so let me just say, it's Shyamalan at his best! It's a great story, a young unknown cast, and the ending will just blow your mind. Unlike most Horror/Thriller writers, Shyamalan doesn't use gore to shock you, but rather has a story that will just scare you to your core, and by the end of this one I was rattled! This is a top notch film that fell way under the radar, because of its unknown cast, but if you like scary movies or edge of your seat thrillers, you have to see this film!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wanted to read this book after seeing the movie and it exceeded my expectations. This is a must read.
B004MPESSY|4.0|When the original I Spit On Your Grave came out in 1978, it was so graphic and violent that it was banned from theaters and television. 32 years later and the remake is ten times more horrific, but much more interesting. They'd planned to release this one in theaters but due to its NC-17 rating, they decided to go with the unrated direct-to-video method. This brutal and horrific story is about a writer who goes to a cabin in the woods, to write her next book, when she becomes the victim of a horrible crime. She survives, but decided it's not justice she wants, it's revenge. I loved this film, because it's something that could actually happen, and when it's a realistic film, no matter how graphic, I find it to be that much more terrifying. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this one, because when I say it's graphic, it is ridiculously so! There is no way they ever would have been able to trim this down to an R rating for theaters, it's that brutal. Personally, I love films like this, the more graphic and realistic, the better, however many others don't agree and most critics claim the film made them physically ill. My suggestion, check it out and decide for yourself!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Only after Bruno Mars' appearance on SNL did I start to like him. His performance of Locked Out Of Heaven got me hooked. And then I heard When I Was Your Man on the radio I melted. Then I decided to buy his album. What a great buy - his songs had me dancing, at the laundromat!
B00846TTDG|2.0|Act of Valor is a refreshingly new and ambitious idea, that takes the stories of active U.S. Marines and turns them into one big story, which is then played out by the very Marines who experienced them. I loved the concept, but this film falls way short of expectations. I believe the purpose of military is the service and protection of our nation, but in Act of Valor the Marines are portrayed as trigger happy Americans. We see the Marines, following up on CIA Intel, going into four different foreign countries, shooting first and asking questions later. Is this really the image of our military that we want to portray to the rest of the world? Regardless of what's real and what's not, these Marines come off as ruthless, with an attitude of 'we're American, we'll do what we want.' As expected, the action scenes were some of the best and most realistic I've ever seen. I would except nothing less, being that the film features men who have been in actual combat and know what it looks like. The acting, also as excepted, was really awful, but for the first time in the twenty month history of this blog I won't blame the actors for it, since after all, they aren't really actors. The action sequences alone more than make up for the bad acting job, but again, I have a real problem with the message this film is sending out to the world. Chronicling the heroism and every day life of a U.S. Marine is admirable, but portraying them like Bruce Willis in Die Hard isn't doing them any favors, in fact it's making an already difficult job harder.
B000V63CGM|5.0|Yes.  Classic. I absolutely adore this album.  It creates such a wonderful mood...  Love it with a cozy fire. Yeah.
B009A87ZQU|3.0|I've never been a fan of James Bond. Probably, because I grew up with Pierce Brosnan as 007 and he sucked. I decide to give the series another shot, not because of Bond, but rather Daniel Craig. I have been a fan of Craig's for some time, having seen several of the films from overseas. I knew then that he would be a huge action star and now he's 007. As for my first Bond movie, it was pretty good. Craig was fantastic and avoided much of the cliché Bond moments that most of us have come to loath. The film was entertaining, but also pretty predictable and much longer than it needed to be. I was also very unimpressed by the bad guys. I thought Bond villains were supposed to be classic, but these guys were rather forgettable. I'm not in love with the Bond character, but this film did open my eyes a little bit and I probably will check out Quantum of Solace in the near future.
B005ZFXBYM|5.0|I have been listening to this particular album since the late 1970's.  It's my favorite Ry Cooder CD; never gets old.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I never read a comic book and when I saw the first X-Men film, I was intrigued, but confused. Throughout the trilogy, I always thought I was missing a lot of the story and this is it. First Class is the missing link that will answer questions for the fans of the movie, who don't follow the comics, and it is one blockbuster film that more than lives up to its hype. From the special effects to the make-up and finally to the actors this film is amazing. Movies like this never win awards, but you will be hard pressed to find better performances than those of James McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, & Michael Fassbender. The whole cast was terrific, the story was fantastic, and the special effects were truly out of this world. This is a great film and I'm craving more. I can't wait to see what connections the next forty years bring between first class and the trilogy. When it's all said and done, I hope I can watch all these films and truly understand the whole story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Riveting. It was hard to put the book down. This should also be made into a movie to give closure.
B009GENZ12|2.0|The Tall Man tries very hard to be something it's not, a Stephen King story. Parts of this film reek with King's influence, but I don't think he'd be all that thrilled about it. When the film first started I thought it was a pretty good movie, but by the end I was just confused. The story follows a local resident in the town of Cold Rock, who has taken over her husband's medical practice after he passed away. That resident is played by Jessica Biel, whose performance and looks are really the only reason to watch this movie. In the town of Cold Rock, the children have been disappearing without a trace and the only thing people have seen is a tall man, dressed in black, leaving the scene. Some people say he's an urban legend, while others claim to have witnessed his abductions, and the whole town is terrified. I found it kind of funny that in a town crippled by fear, not knowing whose child could be next, the kids parents, let them ride their bikes to the store and let them play alone in the fields, it's just one of many parts of this film that just off. As I said, the beginning of this film is terrific, but then it gets weirder and weirder and builds to a conclusion that doesn't make any damn sense! I know this must of have been someone's passion and that they spent years developing it, but before you released it to the public, did you bother to watch it? Jessica Biel is sexy and a terrific actress who is way too good to be doing s***** b-movies like this. If you're a die-hard fan, check it out, she's great, but if you're not, I'd definitely stay away from this one.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This was possibly the best young adult novel I have ever read. Kristin Cashore has completely outdone herself and has succeeded in creating a beautiful and addicting story. I was absolutely captivated by the main characters, and I was astonished by the beauty and believability of the romance that existed between them. This story will definitely stay with me for some time.
B004GBIE3Y|2.0|...except it's not! This film is supposed to be an uplifting comedy, however I found it painfully predictable and a bit sad. Keir Gilchrist was great, playing Craig, a young mental patient who wants to kill himself. Gilchrist and the flashes of his thoughts, that we get to see, are the best part of this film and the only thing really worth seeing. Zach Galifianakis, who is one of my favorites, isn't at all funny, he's actually kind of pathetic in this film. Despite Gilchrist performance, the movie is actually quite stupid, I mean what kind of mental hospital lets the patients have access to the roof of the hospital? It looked good, has some really good actors in it, but nothing happens, the story is predictable as hell, and it's a \\"comedy\\" in which no one really says or does anything funny. I was hugely disappointed with it.
B0067BEB10|5.0|The way they mixed and modified Michael Jackson's songs is amazing. The song selection is good, but I would have chosen a few more (Like Dirty Diana and Who Is It). However, they are all great songs with fresh new sounds. They also took sound bytes where Michael is speaking and placed them in several different parts of the tracks, which was a very intimate and touching feature.<br /><br />Additionally, there was a LOT of controversy regarding a part in the song \\"Will You Be There\\" at Michael Jackson's public memorial service. The lyrics in the actual song from the Dangerous album are \\"...In my anguish and my pain...\\" but on the memorial program, it said \\"and my pains\\". That alone caused an uproar in the M.J. death hoax community. On the album Dangerous, he clearly says \\"PAIN\\". On this CD, made after his \\"death\\" he clearly says \\"PAINS\\". Check it out. That alone is worth the money!!
B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|I Am Number Four, was everything I expected and more, I was completly blown away. It is a refreshingly original story about 9 aliens hiding on Earth, from the creatures who destroyed their home planet. These 9 have special powers that threaten these creatures, and they have set out to kill them, but for some unknown reason, must do it in order. Alex Pettyfer is Number Four and the next one in line. Pettyfer was absolutely incredible, having come such a long way since his last major role as Alex Rider. Newcomer Callan McAuliffe is also very likeable as sidekick Sam. I've never seen him in anything before, but he gives the story an added bonus and much needed side story. Many critics bashed this film, saying it was an alien version of Twilight, but it couldn't be further from the truth. I Am Number Four isn't focused on the love aspect, a lot of action occurs and the story actually progresses, and this film isn't dark and narrow minded, the way the Twilight films have been. I Am Number Four kept my attention and interest throughout. I connected to the story and the characters as well as the actors, and I have no problem saying it is one of the best Science Fiction films I have a seen in years! ...and for those who feel the same way, the book sequel, The Power of Six will be released on August 23, and with any luck will hit the big screen next summer.
158510423X|5.0|Having obtained proficiency in the Arabic language, using the grammar based approach, I decided that I wanted to pursue the study of the classical languages. The acquisition of Arabic entailed long hours of study with the grammar based approached, for this seemed to be the only feasible means to obtain proficiency. However, with Latin, Hans Orberg's method is supreme in my mind, but it does possess some short comings. The marginal, grammar notes did not suffice, when trying to understand the minute details pertaining to the language. This ineptitude required additional supplemental texts to aid in the acquisiton of Latin:[[ASIN:1585101915 Lingua Latina: A College Companion based on Hans Orberg's Latine Disco, with Vocabulary and Grammar]] and [[ASIN:0300100841 Learn to Read Latin]]. The College Companion is worthy of purchase for its vocabulary lists and organization of the same. \\"Learn To Read Latin\\" is good for a quick grammar reference to help solidify key concepts that are a little shaky.<br /><br />This text enables the learner to read Latin from the outset, which builds confidence in one's ability to learn the language. The grammar notes are good for understanding some of the mechanics, such as verb conjugation and noun/adjective declensions. The natural method is exceptional in its ability to aid student's in procuring a copious amount of vocabulary, which greatly enhances the reading proficiency of the learner. Although this text aids in language acquisition, the ultimate achievement of Latin proficiency depends on the student. One must be willing to put in the time to obtain mastery of any language. No text is perfect, but this one is worthy of approbation, and I recommend it for those who desire to pursue this course.
B0032KLAKE|4.0|Based on a best selling novel by William Diehl, Primal Fear stars Richard Gere, as a high powered defense attorney, who decides to take on what appears to be an open and shut case, just so he can get his face on Television. The case is intriguing and did what seldom movies can do, surprise me. There is an ending to this film that will just completely blow you away. As for the rest of the film, it was extremely entertaining thanks to the outstanding cast, that features both Richard Gere and a very young, Edward Norton, in one of his first roles. At the time Norton was a no-name, while Gere was the big star. Who would have thought that eventually Norton would become the bigger name? Well, anyone who saw this film and the absolutely tremendous performance Norton gives. To be honest, most court room dramas don't surprise me. You can always tell if the suspect is guilty or innocent, and there is usually some kind of twist in the story. Primal Fear was not so cut and dry, I kept going back and fourth on the suspects guilt or innocence myself. That's because this is a powerful movie, with an unrivaled cast, written by a professional novelist, as opposed to some amateur screenwriter. Primal Fear is a perfect example of what it takes to create a great movie, and after you watch it, let me know if you can figure out where the title comes from. It took me a while to get it, but eventually I did.

B0039NCJFO|4.0|The original American Pie is certainly a classic comedy on the must see list, but it's not the best of the seven American Pie inspired films. Personally, I preferred the second one too the first, as everyone was much more relaxed and knew each other, making the movie flow better. Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. Jason Biggs & Alyson Hannigan are hilarious, but for all they bring to the table, bad actors like Eddie Kay Thomas and Chris Klein take away, making the good performances moot. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it ushered in a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the raunchy, crazy, good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties.
1936608898|5.0|I love this book!  It's the most compelling, humorously written, can't-put-it-down book that I've ever read on food and health and healing.  Their well-explained reasons for why to do it their way for 30 days make more sense to me than anything else has.  I'm not about pushing anything onto anyone, but I hope that everyone finds their way to this life-altering book and the whole30 program within it.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|Finally, an end of the world thriller that is worth seeing! This remake of 1971's Omega Man is a perfect example of how end of the world movies should occur. The flashbacks to the time before the catastrophe tell the story of what actually happen. Will Smith is really great as Dr. Robert Neville. Instead of going on some insane journey to find an unaffected area, he stays right in the heart of the crisis and tries to fix it. He is a great example of a true hero and Will Smith portrays it perfectly. Smith's personality in a dark and somber movie is a bright spot and his interplay with the innocuous things he encounters is fantastic. Will Smith make the film, aided by a great story and some really cool special effects. This is a good one!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I have been following the ups and downs of the Crawleys and their servants since day 1.  The production values and the acting are tremendous.<br /><br />Inevitably, though, the script has to descend into soap from time to time to retain interest.  Before this series the return of Matthew in the middle of the concert in the second series had been the soapiest but the last moments of the new series are pure soap.  I'll watch and buy the fourth series but with a perhaps more critical eye on the exigencies of the script.<br /><br />Still a great effort by the team.
B002ZCLH5S|2.0|When I was a kid, Explorers was one of my favorite movies. Ever since I can remember I've had a fascination with outer space and all the possibilities that are out there. That being said, Explorers was the perfect movie to me when I was a kid, but watching it again for the first time in fifteen years, things have changed. The story follows three young boys who start having weird dreams. They decide to build what they see in their dreams and to their surprise they build a spaceship. The boys are pulled into outer space, where they meet a group of aliens who are obsessed with our TV broadcasts and use different characters and scenes in order to communicate. As a kid, the story was magical, but as an adult, it was very lame. The hysterical aliens were unbelievably annoying and all the 'cool, futuristic' stuff is now simple classic eighties cheese. As for the cast, they are terrific, obviously, that's why two of the three boys grew up to be stars. Explorers was a favorite of mine as a kid, but that's really who it's aimed at. I watched it again because it's streaming and I loved it then, but watching it now kind of ruined it for me. This isn't like the Goonies, which is good any time at any age. Explorers is a kids movie that doesn't grow up as you do.
034553154X|5.0|I love the fact that this calendar incorporates scenes from multiple books, not just those popularized by the TV series. It also offers more of a mind's-eye view... more in-line with what I imagined as I was reading. The artist did a great job!
B00125WAWS|5.0|The Great Debaters is another inspirational tale of the oppressed, but unlike most, this film has the distinction of being pretty close to historically accurate. I was hesitant to see this film, because who wants to watch a film about a debate team? Denzel Washington, however, happens to be one of my favorite actors, so I gave it a shot and learned quite a bit. The debate team was just an instrument, and was comprised of four people who would all go on to play significant roles in the Civil Rights Movement. The films follows award winning author, Melvin Tolson (Washington), on his journey to create the best African-American College debate team in the country, a team that would eventually go on to challenge the debate team at Harvard University. Everything about this movie was extremely powerful and well done. From the language to the graphic imagery to the story and the performances I was completely blown away by this film. I went into it thinking, if it's bad I'll turn if off after a half-hour. Now, I'm thinking about watching it again tomorrow. This is the way historical films should be done, The Great Debaters was fair, accurate, and just a great film!
B00795P4EG|2.0|not that simple to navigate, not the best results, save your $2. . try Adobe PS Touch for $10; in my opinion.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Yesterday, I had a 3 hour break in-between classes, and a free movie on my AMC Stubbs card, so I went to the movies. Unbelievably the only thing playing at my time was one of the movies I didn't want to see, The Help. Isn't it funny how the movie you never want to see always turns out to be great? The Help is based on a book by the same title, and follows a young writer, in the mid 1960s, looking for an idea. At a party, she notices how horrible people are to the African American help and decides to write their story. Of course it's a scandalous idea that can get them all killed, but Skeeter finds one woman brave enough to tell her story. This movie is funny, heartwarming, and inspirational, not to mention the acting is top notch. Viola Davis deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance, which is one of the strongest I've seen all year. The Help is an amazing story, with a terrific cast, and a big upside. It has a unique and inspiring story that takes us back to a very tumultuous time in American History, and I can't recommend it enough!
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|Needs to be a little harder as you do more. Maybe does get harder and I haven't played enough . Anyway excellent pictures.
B0019IMVDG|5.0|Scorsese's epic true story about how the mafia build Vegas, is as close to a perfect movie as I have ever seen! The story is just so good and you will be hard pressed to ever find a better pair of performances than the ones by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. I love this film, I loved it the first time I saw it, and I loved it the hundredth time I saw it. Casino follows a pair of gangsters who earned their reputations in Las Vegas in two very different ways. De Niro is Ace Rothstein, the man with the plan. He always made money, but since he was Jewish, he was never fully trusted. Pesci is of course, Nicky Santoro, the tough guy who says the f word seven thousand times, while doing things his own way. Everything about this movie is pure genius. It's on my top ten list and I suspect will always have its place.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really awesome and amazing game to play. My experience playing it has only been like 10-15 mins and I already love it!!
B001N3OJEG|5.0|This film is the true definition of a blockbuster, that met and exceeded every expectation. L.A. Confidential is loaded with star power and filmed in a style of films thirty years it's senior. Based on a true story, Three L.A. Detectives, with different reputations and personalities, team up to solve a brutal murder that involves one of their own. The film is loaded with twists and turns that will lead you down many different paths and thanks to the quality of the acting, it's all believable. Just how good was this movie? In 1998, it received NINE Academy nominations, one of the highest number of nominations ever. L.A. Confidential also put Russell Crowe on the map. This film is an extremely exciting 'who done it' mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. The story is top notch, the acting is just about as good as it gets, and you will be hard pressed to find a better mystery. I can't possibly recommend this film enough!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is a real stress reliever and it is not a very hard game and i think you will like it too
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Most of the regular readers of this blog will know that I loath superheros, except for Batman. I've always felt there was so much more then meets the eye when it came to that character, but even I didn't see Batman's full potential until Christopher Nolan took the reigns. In all 3 of his Batman films, Nolan made the Dark Knight as realistic as possible, with characters we can relate to, real situations, and real dialogue, that's free of all the ridiculous puns it's predecessors loved so much. The third installment takes places eight years after the events of the Dark Knight, when Gotham has been safe, and the Batman wasn't needed. That is until the powerful Bane shows up. Unlike the first two, this script does not follow the original comic story and skews off in several different ways. Unless you're a longtime fan of the series, you won't realize it, but for us fans, there are some very unexpected developments, which I assume were thrown in to throw off even the most die-hard fans. As for the film, it was amazing in every way possible and was everything I expect from Christopher Nolan, but still, it lacked something and that something was an extraordinary villain. We were all spoiled in The Dark Knight with one of the best performances of all time, and while this film is remarkable, it's lacking a stand out performance from one of it's stars. I can find very little fault with this film other than the fact that no one character really stood out and made themselves as memorable as Heath Ledger did in the Dark Knight.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I think it is a good book so far I like it.<br />I would recommend to other people I know.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games was everything I expected, but not more than that. I am a huge fan of the series, having read all the books months ago, but I've avoided the movie until all the hype died down, so that I could give an honest opinion, and here it is. The film was terrific, one of the best adaptation of a book I've read. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely perfect as Katniss and if she doesn't get a ton of awards for the role, there is no justice in Hollywood. That's the good news, however the movie was far from perfect. Friends who went with me and had never read the books, found it to be slow, and didn't understand certain things. At times, I could see their point. Several major things were rushed or just left out of the film. This led to some confusion, and then there's Peeta. I love Josh Hutcherson and thought he was terrific, but the portrayal of Peeta wasn't accurate. He was nowhere near as likeable as he is in the books and he comes off looking like kind of a pussy. The end of the games was also problematic, as they changed a key point that I thought was pivotal going into Catching Fire. It will be interesting to see what they do to fix that before the next film. Overall I loved the movie and thought it was awesome, but if you didn't read the books, you might be a little confused by parts of it and see it as slow. Parts of the film that dragged on were explained through thoughts in Katniss's head during the book. Without knowing what was going on at those points, I could see how some audience members may have been bored with it. The movie and especially the books live up to all the hype and are well worth your time, The Hunger Games is something you are not going to want to miss.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I recommend this game to all. It is fun and challenging to play. The more you play and solve the cards the harder and challenging the game becomes.
B00464F19Q|5.0|David Fincher is one of Hollywood's most popular directors, but it's the film Seven that got him his start. This is one of my all-time favorite movie, because it features one of the best casts ever put together, and one of the best endings you will ever see. This dark and gritty crime thriller follows the investigation into a serial killer, who kills his victims based on the seven deadly sins. It is the type of movie that can never be remade or out done, a once in a lifetime film that will shock and thrill audience for decades to come. It's on many top ten lists, including mine, and you will be hard pressed to find a better film. From beginning to end this film is a winner and it is definitely one that should be in your queue.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So interesting!! I loved it. Best book of the series! I think Suzanne Collins needs to write a fourth Hunger Games book!
B006PERRMY|5.0|Time is money and money is time in Andrew Niccol's epic, In Time. In this film, human beings are genetically engineered. At the age of twenty-five, your clock starts ticking and your goal is to work in order to survive. The wealthy are immortal, while the poor die at a young age. The story is refreshingly unique and the film is done very well. Justin Timberlake stars, and shows that he's come a long way in a short time. When I heard he was starring in this film, I thought it would be another great idea destroyed by a cast of good looking people who can't act, but I was wrong. Timberlake shows he's got definite potential to be a big action star and that his n'suck days are way behind him. Cillian Murphy is also terrific as the timekeeper. What I love about Murphy is even when he's a good guy, he's still the guy you're rooting against. His personality makes him the perfect adversary in just about everything he does. In Time, is original, unique, fast moving, and intense. In a Hollywood full of re-makes, sequels, and uninspiring ideas that mimic one another, In Time is a breath of fresh air and was one of the most enjoyable and original films I've seen all year.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|No matter where you are in life, this book will help you understand habits.  Normally we don't think about our daily habits at all. I stopped reading several times to examine my own habits.  I also love the way the author intertwines different stories and at the end of the chapter it all pulls together and makes sense.  Wonderful!
B005OK722U|4.0|It took three films, but finally the new Hostel film initiated a marketable franchise. The first two films were about a bunch of travelers who got kidnapped and killed by millionaires, who were part of some human hunting club, but they didn't go any further than that. Finally, in Hostel III, we see inside the elite hunting club and learn it's purpose. Also unlike the first two films, this Hostel has a plot, that's interesting and apathetic. Featured in Hostel III is Kip Pardue, a veteran b-movie actor, and newcomer Brian Hallisay. They were humorous, likeable, and perfect for this type of film. After two insane gorefests, Hostel finally grew up and learned to combine the shocking violence with a good story, and a likeable cast. This was the by far the best Hostel film so far and one of the best horror movies I've seen all year. If you like horror, don't miss this one. Even if you didn't like the first two films, give this one a shot!

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Even though Ted is a Seth MacFarlane movie, I was hesitant to see it. A thirty year old guy who lives with his foul mouthed teddy bear?! I was expecting another Paul, but MacFarlane isn't British, and THIS film was hysterical. Ted is a raunchy real life living teddy bear, who combines the traits of every MacFarlane character. It was pretty awesome, sometimes you saw him as Peter, other times Brian, and so on. The real surprise of this film was Mark Wahlberg. I can't remember ever seeing him in a comedy and I wasn't sure his rather dry personality would work with MacFarlane's brand of humor, but he fit in like he's been doing this for years. I mean he was Marky Mark, he must have some personality in there somewhere! As for the story, it's not much different than a really good episode of Family Guy. Of course, it a lot more raunchy and it's not animated, but there are certainly many parallels, and defiantly some hysterical lines. It's not the kind of film I usually go for, at points, it's more than a little stupid, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I laughed my ass off throughout the film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book.  The movie is good, but the book is better because of the details not in the movie.  There was a lot of additional detail that just couldn't be put in the movie.  I can't wait to read the other two.
B004LWZW24|1.0|This is a weird movie, that jumps quickly between boring, mildly interesting, and ridiculously stupid. It's good for a couple of good scares in the beginning, but the movie quickly deteriorates from there. The big slogan was, it's not the house that's haunted, and it was compared to the exorcist, both couldn't be further from the truth. Without going into details, the story is just stupid. The special effects are laughable, and the acting is so-so. The kid, newcomer Ty Simpkins, was mildly entertaining and did do a nice job. The parents weren't too bad either, but the rest of the cast were just terrible, a perfect fit for a movie that is pure garbage. If it wasn't for a couple of scares and the fact that I was laughing at how stupid some of the parts were, this movie would have gotten zero stars. It's a complete and utter waste of your time.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|While I thought the movie had merit as far as the look and the acting, it was far more &#34;chick flick&#34; than anything else.
B004SIP9MY|4.0|Horror legend, Wes Craven, wanted to mix a traditional slasher film, with a who done it mystery, while at the same time parading both. The result is Scream, which turned into a much bigger film and franchise than he expected. He wanted to do this sort of under the radar, with a cast of virtual unknowns, but due to its uniqueness, the movie quickly gained popularity and today is considered one of the best horror movies of all time. The cast are all household names now and the ending of this film is legendary. Twists, turns, paranoia, accusations, one liners, and good looking people is what Scream is all about. The story is a great one, the cast is solid, and when it comes to writer/directors, you can't get much better than Wes Craven. The original Scream is one that should be on your must see list!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This is a good movie, but I am not overly fond of the first part in this series for the last book. It was worth watching though because the second part rocked pretty hard. NEVILLE!!! :)
B005BZQVJ8|1.0|aking a funny science fiction based movie is not easy. There have been a few good ones and many many past flops. If anyone could do it, I was sure it would be Seth Rogan. I've loved almost everything he's been in and with this current streak, I thought he couldn't lose, but with Paul, he did. The story was original, but it was so out there that it crosses the line from funny to stupid and then doesn't go far enough to get back to funny. Paul is supposed to be this humanized alien, whose raunchy and outrageous, but the truth is he was like a hyper-active 12 year old. As for Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, they are dry and confusing, nothing new there. The only thing of interest in this film is really the cameos, so a I'd like to give a big thanks to Jason Bateman, Jane Lynch, Sigourney Weaver, Blythe Danner, & Jeffery Tambor for adding something of interest to an otherwise awful movie!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Of course I loved it. Better than part one for sure! Of course, watching both is recommended.<br />I am going to miss these movies...
B0042UEU8M|2.0|This isn't normally the type of movie I watch. I decided to check it out though, because people have been raving about it. It also features Charlie Tahan, who is one of the biggest up and coming stars around. Charlie St. Cloud also has some awesome cameos and let's face it, Zac Efron was pretty good in 17 again, so I took a chance. Sadly though, even with all the film apparently had going for it, Charlie St. Cloud was a boring flop. The story follows a young man's journey to re-discover himself following a drunk driving accident that claimed the life of his little brother. It's a solid story to build on, but that's just it, it really doesn't go anywhere from there. Charlie is consumed by what happened and even years later spends hours in the woods talking to his brothers ghost. If you watch the first fifteen minutes of the movie, there really all there is to see. It had a lot of potential and fairly good cast, but honestly I found the film to be boring and really depressing.
0440237688|5.0|Excellent story about the most perfect society, and the darkness required in order to keep people &#34;happy&#34; all the time. Brings up some interesting questions. Read it will your kids, it can easily create a lovely discussion about the themes represented in the book. (PS: there are two (I think) sequels out. Also good, but don't read them if you like the way this one ended)
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|On the surface, Tower Heist appears to be nothing more than a stupid comedy about some pissed off employees, getting back at their rich bosses, that's kind of why I didn't want to see it. This movie did surprise me though, aside from it's lame jokes, there is substance here, which include a pretty good story and an interesting cast. Ben Stiller is terrific as usual, but Eddie Murphy was not. I was never a big fan to begin with, but in recent years he has completely lost the ability to be funny and carry a film, the way he did with the Beverly Hills Cop series. Usually Murphy is an asset, injecting humor into an otherwise dry plot, but here his appearance actually takes away from the film. His character is both forced and uninteresting and I'd go as far as to say that this movie would have been better, if Eddie Murphy's character was just eliminated altogether. As I said earlier, the previews don't do this film justice and if you base what you're going to watch solely on previews, than you probably didn't see Tower Heist, and you're missing out. It is an interesting movie, that's different, and has a couple of twists in the story. Not an award winner by any means, but it's certainly something that will entertain you for a couple of hours.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I was a big fan of the first three movies. Apparently I am more of a Matt Damon fan than I thought. Don't waste your time. This one drags on, and has very little insofar as memorable moments or sequences.
B005SAV9SO|2.0|Bad Teacher is a bad movie. Billed as the raunchiest film since Bad Santa, my expectations were high. As far as I'm concerned, the raunchier the better, but seldom is a film that calls itself raunchy, actually raunchy. Cameron Diaz was terrific, but the story was extremely weak. There is zero character development, I wanted to punch most of the supporting cast, and as far as being funny, it's only good for a snicker here and there. It's a predictable story about a gold digger seeking money to get plastic surgery. Parts of it are painful and the rest of it is just really stupid. Honestly, if it wasn't for the use of the F word, this movie would be rated PG-13 at best. Diaz is a fantastic actress and the story had so many possibilities, but they were all overlooked. The result, another mediocre, overrated, comedy billing itself as raunchy.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|While this movie has a few huge plot problems, and goes for at least two VHS tape lengths (j/k) -viewers looking for a good sequel will not have any qualms about this movie's flaws, but will instead enjoy the tidy package and surprise ending.
B004NOH9LW|1.0|From Director Clint Eastwood comes the tale of three people's near death experiences, and the psychic who they turn to, to explain it all. Why do I keep watching movies directed by Eastwood? They are almost always much too long and a complete bore. This film, like many of his others, was supposed to have a hidden meaning, but I didn't get anything out of it. Eastwood is a legend and at this point can pretty much make anything he wants. Hereafter, even managed to get a decent cast, but the film itself is pure crap. Seriously, if anyone but a world renowned, Academy Award winning Director decided to make something like this, they wouldn't get in the studio gate. Oh yes, it is really that bad. This is one film you can avoid like the plague!
B000OW8DW6|4.0|A plausible theme and a good cast make this movie well worth it. Could this be where we are headed?
B005DN7W4G|4.0|Deep Impact is a pretty good movie with a very unfortunate name. It is another story that plays into people fears about the end of the world, with a situation we rarely think about. As far as stories go, this is a good one, telling the story from four different angles. Tea Leoni's was by far the most interesting, as an up and coming reporter from a troubled family, who becomes the face of the crisis. What I didn't like was the storyline in space, where the would be heroes try to stop the asteroid. It just seemed unnecessary and like it dragged on. If the legendary Robert Duvall wasn't one of the astronauts, I'm pretty sure most of those scenes would have been cut. Deep Impact has a great cast, with a strong story, but it's also a little slow and cheesy at points, but it's a much better movie than most of the other end of the world scenario films.
B001VM0LAK|5.0|Bruce Willis' character is efficient and merciless and Richard Gere makes a believable ex-con turned good guy in this action packed drama. Don't miss it if you love any number of movies ranging from Air Force One to The Whole Nine Yards.
B001DSNEJM|4.0|The Lazarus Project is a highly imaginative film and a refreshingly original concept by writer/producer John Glenn. The story follows Ben Garvey (Paul Walker), a family man with a troubled past. When his family hits hard times, the only thing left for him to do, is turn to what he is good at, committing crime. Unfortunately for him, this time someone dies during the crime and he is given a death sentence. As he's in the execution chamber, the drugs pump into him, and that should be the end of the story, but it's not. Garvey awakes seemingly unharmed and reborn in a small Oregon town, in the middle of nowhere. He's told that he's been given a second chance, but quickly figures out that all is not as it seems. The Lazarus Project is full of twists and turns and is kind of similar to Shutter Island. We see a lot of things and changes that we're not sure are real or in Garvey's imagination, that's why I loved this movie. The film makes you think and actually figure things out for yourself. Unlike many similar films, Glenn doesn't just assume we're a bunch of idiots and puts us right alongside Ben Garvey as we figure out what's going on. The story is pure genius, but if this way my project I would have chosen a different star. Sure, Paul Walker is nice to look at, and does an adequate job, but this is a highly emotional story that doesn't play to his strengths as an actor. Walker didn't convincingly portray the emotions of the given situations and made their effect less dramatic. This film is also painfully slow at times, but the good most definitely out weighs the bad. The Lazarus Project is original and will keep you guessing, which sadly, is something most films today can't claim.
1439170916|5.0|A masterpiece of science writing.  A powerful treatise not only on the history of this disease, but also a real insight on why cancer is so intimately linked to our very being.
B004EPZ084|4.0|From Arrested Development creator, Brett Ratner, and the star of Freaks & Geeks, John Francis Daly, comes Horrible Bosses. What made this film stand out from other raunchy comedies, was that there wasn't just one super funny guy that the other played off of. Every character had their moment and was funny in their own way. The story was fairly original too. Three miserable guys decide all their problems would end if they kill each other's boss and they go on a hilarious mission to get the job done. While I love the idea and thought the movie was genuinely funny, what it lacks is character development. Other than the abuses they face at work, you don't really know too much about these guys and where they are coming from. I feel like that weakened the film, but what more than makes up for it is a ton of hilarious cameos. I love cameos and there are some great ones from Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, and Collin  Farrell. Horrible Bosses while lacking substance is defiantly good for a few laughs, which is pretty much all that I expect from these types of movies.
1909313033|5.0|As a pug owner of over five years now to sisters Violet and Daisy, I can honestly say that this book by Gemma Correll is the most honest portrayal of pug life of any I've ever seen.  'A Pug's Guide to Etiquette' had all of us laughing as we'd read a few pages, point at our pugs and then laugh again.  Seems that all pugs are alike, and truly are the funniest breed of dog.  No other dog that we've ever owned has seemed more like a human in dog form.  Her drawings are wonderful, very simple and clean.  And the expressions on her pug faces are spot on.  I love this book.<br /><br />Yes, our dogs lick the air, stand between/on our feet, shed endlessly, have feet that smell of popcorn---though we think ours smelled a bit like tortilla chips as well.<br /><br />Correll takes from real life by using her own pugs as inspiration.  And really, that's the only way to do it since I had no idea pugs were so adorable and addictive until we got ours.  Pug owners truly are kindred spirits.  Nobody else can really get it.<br /><br />Thank you Gemma Correll for telling the world how glorious pug ownership is.  After this book gets out in public we might just experience a pug shortage.<br /><br />More of Gemma's work can be found at her website at GemmaCorrell.com.<br /><br />(I received this book free to review from CICO books)
B000NDMRDW|3.0|In The Day After Tomorrow, the writers take a real life theory and magnify it by a billion, turning it into a apocalyptic special effects thrill ride. Something that is supposed to happen in thousands of years, happens in a couple days, with Jack and Sam Hall caught in the middle. While one is trapped in hard hit New York City, the other must track across the country to save him. Okay, it's a little cheesy and the acting isn't the best, but the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. I like that it's based on fact and a look into a possible future, well beyond my lifetime and overall it was extremely entertaining. Many of my fellow reviews considered the film to be a warning on global warming, but that's really crazy. Unless you're Al Gore, you should see this movie for what it is. A bunch of smart writers having fun with a scientific theory that may or may not come true one day.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many NDE stories, this stands out among them all, it is very well written and should be read and recommended
B0014BC3C2|3.0|This is the story of the aftermath of a terrorist bombing. Rendition shows what happens behind the scenes of tragedy from six different sides and it's a pretty compelling story. I love how unique and eye opening this film is, however they really dumb it down for you. This should be the kind of movie that makes you think, but instead they kind of explain everything in detail to you from beginning to end. The film was very realistic and clear, that is until the ending. They took this intense, believable, behind the scenes film, and gave it an impossible ending which honestly wound up ruining the whole thing for me.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a really great book! I enjoyed every word on every page! :) Now I'm going to go watch the movie.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|After 20 years, Indiana Jones returned for a new generation to enjoy. It is simply amazing that at almost 70 years of age, Harrison Ford was able to do this movie, and even perform some of his own stunts. In the film, they introduce Shia LaBeouf as his son, so that the franchise can continue. Indiana Jones has been around since the early 80s. There are hundreds of books and stories they could have chosen from, and I suspect most of them would have been better than the Crystal Skull. Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't bad, but aliens, Elvis, sword fights on the back of a jeep, cannibalistic ants, and Shia swinging through the Amazon with a family of monkeys? That's not Indiana Jones. I realize they wanted to portray him in perhaps the final years of his career, but the story was not great. The action scenes, effects, stunts, and cast were all great, and what you've come to expect from Indy, but the movie itself wasn't the best. It's enjoyable and worth seeing, but for the most part it doesn't fit with what we know of Indiana Jones.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great first hand account of what really happened that night! And more important, what it took for these great Americans<br />to get there that night
B007FH9GA6|3.0|Does the international sensation The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo live up to all the hype? In my estimation, no! There is no denying that the story is amazing. The book may be amazing, and the original Swedish version of the film might be equally amazing, but David Fincher's adaptation of it is not. From the very beginning it seems as thou he's trying to turn this story into something it's not, a sequel to Seven. The story is fantastic, however, there are so many odd names and so many mumbled lines thrown at you so quickly, that you're easily confused. At many points in this film I was confused, and even when the killer was revealed, my reaction was \\"which one is that?\\" Besides being confusing, the film has about an hour of footage that has nothing to do with the main story and just adds to the overall confusion of the film. Like I said, the story is really good, the actors were really good also, but the film was just very long and confusing, and to be honest, I really wasn't all that impressed by it.
B000P0J09M|2.0|It is a great movie, but it stops in the middle and keeps going to a menu, obviously defective . But anyone who has seen the movie , knows the story is great
B005H9B44A|3.0|The great and powerful Thor was one of the biggest grossing movies of 2011. The special effects in this film were really some of the best I've ever seen and the star of the film, Chris Hemsworth was amazing, but besides that, this film was extremely overrated. Thor is banished to Earth for disobeying his father, the King, and must live as a mortal. Surprisingly, it doesn't take him very long to adjust, and he falls in love with Natalie Portman during a fifteen minute car ride. Okay, so the plot was weak to begin with, but the special effects could have more than made up for that. What I really didn't like about this film was just how fast everything happened. Thor is going to be in the Avengers trilogy and there is a good possibility there may be a sequel to this film, so what was the point in rushing everything? The character of Thor is a majestic one. He is one of the most powerful superheroes that ever existed. This film should have been the epic classic that was talked about for years, but instead they rushed the story and hid behind some great special effects. It was visually impactful, entertaining, and had a great star, but a side from that, this film is nothing more than a common theme with a weak script.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|If you are a fan, and have not seen this and are thinking of buying it. Do it. This was outstanding. I bought parts 1 and 2 and I haven't watched part 2 yet. It's hard to make a decent animated film based on a comic. This is the best one I've seen. I thought it was funny that the ending credits showed that most of the people involved in this production were probably from the far east. They obviously have mastered animated movies. The movies stays close to the original storyline from the comic novel that came out nearly 25 years ago. Looking foward to the 2nd part.
B00AEFYCL4|2.0|It was critically acclaimed, full of stars, and Academy nominated, but Into The Wild wasn't for me. The film is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man in search of true freedom. A recent college graduate, inspired by naturalist literature, McCandless decided to travel to Alaska and live off the land. The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy. I suspect it was for the same reason I didn't like the film, it is unbelievably slow. The story and cast are amazing, but everything is so sedentary and precise, that you can barely sit through the thing! Some three hour plus films, don't feel anywhere near that long, that's how you know they're great. On the other hand, Into The Wild easily feels much longer than three hours and unfortunately doesn't do the story justice.
B009MXSWI8|5.0|Rated NC-17 for the cursing, over the top gore, and a very brief scene (4 seconds?) that implies sexual penetration of a female character by an &#34;evil&#34; vine in the woods. Nudity is very limited (female breasts, not sexual context). The f-word is used more than once. Putting aside the possessed vine scene (which was cringe-worthy and could have been left out without affecting the story), this movie is ridiculous fun and strangely charming. The movie is clearly low budget and the effects are sloppy and nowhere near realistic. Bruce Campbell's performance only hints at his acting style that we eventually see in #3. Good pace once it gets rolling.
B002KH4KSY|3.0|I've liked Stephen King's Children of The Corn series since I was a kid and I was very interested when I heard that they were remaking them. The new version is different, but that's not always a good thing. It's definitely a lot more gory and frightening, which is a good thing, but they cut a lot out of the story which was a bad thing. We aren't given any background information, characters are missing, and Isaac is so little and cute, that he isn't believable. On top of that, instead of a loving middle aged couple, we get a fighting interracial couple, in 1975, that features a Marine with PTSD and a prom queen who won't shut up! I'm glad it was a little creepier and bloodier than the original, but they cut out some of the best parts and give absolutely no background information. I felt like I was jumping into a movie after missing the first half hour, besides that, the acting was so-so, and overall the film was okay at best. In my opinion this film does not live up to the original and would have trouble rivaling some of the sequels as well.
B004UPANGM|3.0|I saw this years ago and just recently re-viewed this movie. I found it repetitive, weak, a little confusing (why would Ash go back to the house with another girl if he didn't expect more trouble?), and only necessary because it sets up the premise for the far superior #3. I really loved the first and third Evil Dead movies and wished this were better.
B004XQO90O|4.0|I love movies that make you think, and Source Code will do that, the problem is, that what you're thinking is probably what's going to happen. This film is a take on the TV show Quantum Leap, but instead of leaping until the issue is solved, the leaper only has 8 minutes to try and solve the problem. Jake Gyllenhaal stars and while I usually don't care for him much, he was excellent here. I have a feeling this character may have been written specifically for him, because he's got a strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles. Source Code is another film in a genre of endless possibilities, it tries really hard to stand out and be special, but sadly it's pretty predictable, while playing off other established material, such as Quantum Leap and The Matrix. It is an enjoyable film and one of Gyllenhaal's best performances that i've seen, but if you're into Science Fiction, the way that I am, you're not gonna have much trouble figuring this one out.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I liked it a lot but at times I was bored with details. The plot is excellent, although at times the information was too much for me.
B004YSDT52|4.0|Insomnia was the second major motion picture by acclaimed writer/director, Christopher Nolan. Even in the most early stages of his career, it's easy to see his genius, that's why so many big stars wanted to work with him right away. Insomnia is the least well known of all his films and does lack some of the things that have become Nolan's trademark, but it's still a terrific film. The story follows two L.A. Detectives sent to a remote part of Alaska, where the sun doesn't set for six months and then doesn't rise for six months. They're there to solve a brutal and calculated murder, but circumstances lead them down a different path. Despite being one of the best Hollywood has to offer, I haven't really been much of a Pacino fan. To me, it seemed as though he had lost something with age, his performance in Insomnia proved me wrong. Terrific is not the word for what Al Pacino was and he's not the only genius Nolan surrounded himself with. This film is incredibly well written and being the perfectionist that he is, Nolan got only the best people to star in it. It's not the kind of Nolan film, we've been spoiled with over the past 10 years, but Insomnia is a great story, with an unbelievable cast and in my opinion is a must see.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is the 2nd book in the series, and there are various kings out to seek revenge of Kings Landing and reclaim the Iron Throne, each with a different purpose in mind. For instance, Robb Stark is seeking his father's revenge. Stannis is eldest to Rob Baratheon, and rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Renly Baratheon believes having served under Rob Baratheon earned him the right to be King over the realm. But is that necessarily the case? King Joffrey, and the rest of the Lannisters are defending the Iron Throne or keeping this troublesome king out of harms way. Whilst all of this is going on Daneryius the \\"Mother of Dragons,\\" is making her way back on a long, cumbersome journey, to reclaim the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. There are quite a few other kings  that are all in claim of the Iron Throne, and it seems to be King against King, and a lot of death throughout this medieval read.  However they are all defending their claim, and this creates a gruesome, descriptive and excellent adventure for you to read.<br /><br />That said, again I had a hard time getting into this, and would rather I watch the TV series over read the book, which by the way book two and the tv series had many more contrasts than that of book one and the tv series. One major difference is how Bran is really a wolf in his dreams in the book but it does not expand on that in the tv show. However that is important because this characteristic saves them.  Hence the reason I read more than I watch tv. It leaves the image to the mind and least strays from the original blueprint that the author created for us. Enjoy your read.
B001KT6JPA|3.0|Hannibal was a pretty good movie, but the whole time I had the feeling that there was something off about it. Anthony Hopkins was simply amazing as he is in most everything he does and The rest of the cast was equally as good, but the story was a bit strange. Out of the four Lecter movies, this is the one that just doesn't fit. I didn't like the whole overseas aspect, although the manhunt was Lecter was pretty good. Clarice Starling was a completely different character in Hannibal and it has nothing to do with that fact that another woman was playing her. Juliana Moore did a great job, but Starling, wasn't the same Starling we came to love in Silence of The Lambs. She was reckless and honestly not as smart as the Starling we all know and love. Overall I liked the movie and it had some great parts to it, especially the ending, but it really doesn't fit the genre of what we know about Hannibal Lecter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Totally worth buying minecraft is awesome cool cool make a assassin creed map and town seed: caves ,forest, jungle,waters as ll
B003NTSBUG|4.0|\\"Is it better to live as a monster or to die as a good man?\\" That is the last line in this mind bending thriller from Martin Scorsese. It perfectly describes this film, which I can honestly say is one of the smartest and most savvy films I have ever seen. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date. I've seen a lot of DiCaprio, since Titanic, we all have, and this is by far the best he's ever been. How he didn't win an Academy Award for this role is beyond me! The story is very strong and very smart. It's evident that they took their time with this one, in order to get every detail right. The ending is of course the best part. It leaves you scratching your head, going over everything you've just seen and keeps you thinking for hours. No matter how many times you see this movie, you'll always pick up on something new, each and every time. It was an amazing movie and I can't recommend it enough!
B002JVWR4A|4.0|One of my favorite shows on television.  I have loved the story lines and await the 6th season's price coming down so I may contribute to my series collection
B0041VV03A|2.0|Science Fiction is my passion. I write it, I read it, I watch it, & I love it, but movies like Splice are what keeps people away from the genre. This film is twisted, disgusting, and just messed up. Two scientists decide they can splice human and animal DNA to create a genetically perfect being. This being would naturally produce cures to many diseases and could change the world. The whole time I was waiting for this thing to go crazy and kill everyone, but it doesn't quite happen that way. First, the scientists treat it like a pet, than a baby, than they have sex with it... Oh no, I'm not joking! This film is disgusting! ...and how come everything these scientists make looks like a big penis? Seriously, I have never seen something that is just so pointless and disturbing. I can honestly say I wish I hadn't seen this film.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not quite as captivating as the first two books in the series but still leaves you wanting a little bit more!
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|If you're not a baseball fan, you're going to find Moneyball boring and a little bit confusing. I am an avid baseball fan and saw this film about the inner working of the front office to be extremely interesting and just plain awesome. The Oakland Athletics are a small market team and can't afford to put a hundred and fifty million dollar team of stars on the field every years, so how can they possibly compete? It's a problem faced by almost half the teams in Major League Baseball, while teams the Yankees and Red Sox win year after year, teams like Royals haven't made the playoffs in twenty-five years! In sports, if you can't win, you can't draw fans and make a profit, so when you can't afford a winning team, you were just screwed, until Moneyball. Based on the true story of Oakland Athletics General Manager, Billy Beane, the film follows his creation of a system to judge players on more than just the basic scouting and numbers that have been used for a hundred years. Using this system, Beane and others who followed, have been able to compete with much lower payrolls, changing the face of Baseball. Brad Pitt is terrific as Beane and most definitely earned his Oscar nominations, but where did Jonah Hill's come from? I love Jonah Hill, but his character was as generic and boring as they come. In Moneyball, Hill plays Brad Pitt's sidekick, and is nothing more than a boring statistician, I've seen B-Movie performances that upstaged his in this film! If you love sports and want to know more about the behind the scenes aspect of it, Moneyball is a terrific film to use, but if you're not much of a fan and don't really care about sports, that you will just find this film boring. It's geared to a very specific type of moviegoer and if you're not into sports, you won't be into Moneyball.
B008LV05EG|3.0|Yeah, I was a bit disapointed by the sound mix as compare to how she was sounding when I first discovered here on Palladia live (either on a Story Tellers unplugged, or perhaps on London Live).
B005LAIGLE|4.0|Mark Wahlberg is certainly no genius, but when it comes to action movies, he's on top of his game. I wish I could say Contraband was an amazing film, but it was your typical, shoot 'em up action thriller, although the plot was better than most. A lot of critics bashed this film because of its predictability, but what do you expect from these types of films? The story, about an ex-smuggler, returning to his old ways to pay off an unexpected debt, was easy to follow and full of cool action sequences. That's really all you can ask for from these films and I rather enjoyed it. If you don't like action movies, don't watch them! If you do like them, Contraband is a pretty good one and few action stars bring to the table the experience that Whalberg has. If you're looking for something that you don't really have to think about, that will hold your attention, and kill a couple of hours, go with Contraband.
B0076NAW48|5.0|I'm an old German blues boy, loving such \\"old\\" music for over 50 years (!) and always thought: Sometimes there will be a pianoman who brings that music into year 2000 or later. Here he is! There are so many modern followers of pianoblues and boogie woogie who play it note for note but the old boys like Little Brother Montgomery, Leroy Carr, Otis Spann have done it much better. They had more soul and feeling of the low down blues, but than the keyboarder of THE ROLLING STONES  has done it: For me he is the \\"new\\" pianobluesman of the year. He knows the old masters but he plays it in his own way. He really pays homage to the great pioneers of bluespiano. Believe it or not: In my opinion no one can do it better. He is rolling, swinging, rocking his piano in a modern way and he has got a fantastic voice for the songs (he sounds younger than he is looking). The two piano- guitar duets with help of good ol' Keith Richards are the best I've heard for many, many years.<br />More than 55 minutes of Let the good times roll.
B007YJ8ZRK|4.0|Using just a video camera, High School outcast, Andrew, documents the events surrounding a recent discovery. In the woods, he and his friends discovered something unexplainable, something that gives them supernatural powers. What I loved about this film, is unlike, many many others, these kids didn't take these powers and become superheroes, instead they did what any real life teenager would do and use them for pranks, popularity, and various other things. Also unlike similar \\"camcorder\\" films, it wasn't jumpy or choppy and it was quite easy to follow. The first hour of this film was amazing, unfortunately it did go downhill at the end. The whole film was done in a realistic fashion, making science fiction seem possible, until the end, when all hell breaks loose and it honestly just destroyed the whole thing for me. It was such a strong start, but such an awful ending. Most of the cast were newcomers and were very good, the story was also very solid, but this film needs a much better ending if it wants to be considered a classic.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I deleted it cause it was dumb and no one I know play it but they did have some names and they never responded
B006FLGBGA|2.0|Two stars is generous for this film! I didn't really want to see this overhyped prequel, but my friends felt otherwise, and we went. For the first 40 minutes, the movie actually has a plot, is on genre, and was surprisingly good! Unfortunately, it goes way downhill from there. As the apes get smarter, the reality of the film decreases, and gets to the point where it becomes laughable. I loved the first half, but by the end of the film, I couldn't wait for it to end. First time director, Rupert Wyatt, really doesn't know when enough is enough! Some of the scenes just went on and on, and of course, they were the more ridiculous ones. Andy Serkis, who played the main ape, did a nice job with what must have been a difficult role. I give him props for that, but it's a good performance wasted in a ridiculous film, that was much too long, one that eventually becomes a farce of itself. Seriously, ignore the hype and save your money, this film is a waste of time.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this one, I loved the Mowgli stories, (i see now much they Kidized them for the disney movie now,) and I especially loved re-reading Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.
B006QF7664|1.0|This film is shot on old cameras, in a 70s style documentary, that someone would have made on an old camcorder. Someone uncovers the tapes of this secret, classified, NASA mission, that was buried and turns it into this film. Apollo 18 shows how the astronauts came into contact with extra terrestrial life. I was expecting this to be a trippy Sci-Fi movie, it wasn't. I also thought maybe the aliens would be hostile and it would be an action packed horror flick, not really. The truth is, it's hard to say what this was besides bad! First of all, the look they use for effect, hampered the viewers, the constant interruption and flashes were just annoying! The actors really have no dialogue outside of their work, meaning we know basically nothing about them, so there is no connection with the audience. The dialogue is bland, the effects are cheap, and the cinematography makes you want to vomit. It's not Paranormal Activity, nor is it the Blair Witch, it's a cheap rip off of both, that's not worth one minute of your time.
0786838655|5.0|One of my boys favorites and they needed this one to complete their set.  Great for them to carry to school.
B00000JSJC|4.0|In a futuristic world, black market virtual reality is all the rage. Ex-Cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the guy you go to for all your virtual dreams. He can get you anything from the ultimate vacation to porno and everything in between. Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others. It's a cool film and a different story, but most of the acting is weak, and the story repeats itself leading up to its predictable ending.
B005LAII8A|3.0|Found this a difficult movie to get into as i am not a real fan of this type of movie .Not my best Bruce Willis movie
B0072GPQNG|4.0|A great story line some really graffic scenes with the horse in barbed wire .<br />Different type of war story
B001NLKWLW|4.0|A story of great desire coupled with great loss. The characters are flawed and their destinies painful. However, the value of an ever coming future transcends sadness into hope. Beautiful.
0765334798|5.0|Everyone who has watched Star Trek will immensely appreciate this book! I read it in a day.<br />Also, the deconstruction of the storyline is great fun.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app and easy to use.  Have used the same app on the iPhone and the Kindle app is so much better.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the BEST slender on amazon and was really worth it. so far I have seen only 2 glitches I was walking in the cemetery and just started.... falling. Still this is really awesome and I'm glad I found a slender game on here
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great graphics great game. hard to find good games but this is one. hard to put down.loved everything about it.

B00A77II0U|5.0|great story and graphics.couldn't stop playing. awesome game.would highly recommend. kept me entertained for hours. storyline was well done. love this game.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Intriguing book that embodies defiance, ambition, breaking out of society norms, working towards self-satisfaction no matter what society judges.<br /><br />It urges you to wander, get swirled with contradictory emotions, and merely speechless after finishing it up.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzles are lovely and there is a large number to choose from. They only take a few minutes but I find them very relaxing and destressing after a busy day!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read what the young people read and find that MANY adults are on this as well. I have been to the coastal areas of Carolinas and wil look at it differently next time.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|This is a phenomenal story of a man that knows how beautiful life is and will not let anything convince him otherwise, and will go to any length not to let life in a Nazi internment camp get his family down.  Both very serious and thought provoking and absolutely hilarious at the same time.  One of my top five movies ever and I watch a lot of movies from every category.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Had to read the full story when I heard the film was in the making. THe detail and volume of character development really enhanced the trilogy. I have read them 3 times now and each time with a focus on a different character. Great for adult conversation of all ages and experiences.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|If you like musicals or classic movies from early Hollywood, Singing in the Rain is a must see.  Even if you aren't really a musical fan per se, this movie is just so hilarious it might be the one to convert you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderfully concluded as a not-so-happily ever after. She was a realistic teenager. To deal with the prospect of death at every turn is not so far fetched. The futuristic elements appeal to all of the gamers i'm sure.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Hitchcock is a master story teller. The chemistry is obvious between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. An unusual story with many a twist and turn. You won't go wrong with this movie on a cold February night. Light a fire, heat up some hot chocolate, sit back, relax and enjoy.
B007SGM084|5.0|There is actually a story under the steamy conflicted sex scenes. Family elements are amazingly believable and the backgrounds of the many characters serves to fill out the reality portion of this trilogy. I look forward hopefully to the mirror image trilogy - written from his view (as in the teasingly last chapter)
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|Wow do I ever like this release!<br /><br />As a percussionist brought up on hair metal in high school who became friends with two different funk drummers, I really, really, really appreciate this CD.  It's a nice blend of many musical worlds, and it constantly has me tapping along with the funky grooves.<br /><br />Lately, I've seen Joe Bonamassa in my hometown of Detroit... then traveled to see his band in Indianapolis... and then many months later in Toledo, Ohio... with the latter two shows showing glimpses of the Rock Candy Funk Party groove.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Even nicer was when I attended the Toledo JB show in November of 2012, and afterwards, expecting to hear ZZ Top's \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" coda, we were treated to RCFP instead.  Hearing this \\"new\\" groove caused me to ask the soundman about the song.  He responded: \\"Rock Candy Funk Party... with their release coming out in late January 2013.\\"<br /><br />So I pre-ordered here on Amazon... and was delighted when the CD/DVD package arrived.<br /><br />It starts out strong... and then gets into some \\"cooler\\" night-time grooves.<br /><br />With the last song being intriguing for its 3 minute use of silence.<br /><br />It's not your usual Joe Bonamassa blues-rock blend at all.<br /><br />Instead, it's synergistic school for the oh-so-cool!<br /><br />Funkus Maximus indeed!!  Two thumbs way up!!!<br /><br />Brian Shell<br />Author, Artist, Musician
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I enjoy delving into complex fantastical histories that follow a grand scope of family legacy and conflict. This is the new LOTR!
B0090SI3ZW|4.0|The people going into this film expecting a deep story and well rounded characters had an entirely different movie in mind.  Iron Fists promises over the top martial arts mayhem flavored with a hefty dose of kung-fu movie cliches - and it delivers.  It's everything you want in a Tarantino film, plus everything you expect of a Tarantino film; the fact that it was directed by someone else blows my mind.<br /><br />Turn off that part of your brain responsible for critical thinking for a couple hours and just go into this movie expecting a fun ride; you won't be disappointed.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great idea. Amazon is always on top of the best and latest. Keep the ideas coming. I look forward to seeing this in action.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|This is a very different type of game. I like the concept of a real sleepwalker and how you can help him
B001HN694K|4.0|Brilliant reenvisioning of the Alice legend. We all recall the child's trip down the rabbit-hole, the improbable adventure. Tim Burton reimagines the tale to invest the Wonderland values upon an Alice on the threshold of adulthood. Courage and Wisdom, and the practical value of believing six impossible things before breakfast every day. A tale that inspires fresh Vision, and imbues even the ordinary with wonder.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I just didn't have high expectations from this movie, for some reason. I'm not a movie buff nor an &#34;expert snob.&#34; I'm just a regular person who likes movies, or not, like you. This is really an easy and fun movie to watch, with an interesting plot and plenty of suspense built in. Easily a great movie to recommend.
B0092EE5HY|4.0|This book entralled my after the first chapter.  GRR Martin is a very good writer and I also love his 'Game of Thrones' writing, I just want him to FINISH the %#$^ series so I know how it ends and can move on.  This book does not suffer from the syndrome.  It's a good story and has many of the human weaknesses set in the minds and atributes of alien planets and their populations.  The central character is a vegetarian and talks with his cats.  In any case, it is a good story from a good story telling writer.  I'd read it again.
B008M721MS|3.0|I started Skyping when I got my Fire 8.9, and the app seems to work OK, but I've had problems with the sound being delayed about a minute after the video connects.  Discovered this version is way out-dated when I tried a 3-way and this version does not support it.  I just got an email saying there's a new version for tablets, but alas no Fire update again.  Think I'll write Skype and push.  You too!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Bought this basically because it has been on the best seller liter for so long. Waste of money, didn't care for it at all. Characters unlike able, too much back and forth of narrating characters. Just not my cup of tea......

B000MRAAJM|5.0|One of the best pieces of art ever made.<br />Is visually astonishing, showing the world from another point of view.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|It has been a very long time since I watched a film, that I knew nothing of going into it, yet found myself engrossed in it enough to reference it as a &#34;film&#34; rather than a movie. I won't go into detail about what the film is about; certainly many others have done a great job of leaving a description/review. What I will say is that this film was beautiful. I was so taken by it that immediately after seeing it, I watched it again. Only pausing before the second round to text my friends and advise that if they have not seen it, to quickly do so.  Now, I am sharing that same message with those who read this review.
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the book...<br />At times I felt the writer dragged the story out too long, but the feeling faded quickly when the next ploy was set up

B0044XV3R8|1.0|Frst off i was under the impression i was ordering a blu-ray copy because thats what i had clicked on after i searched Avatar Blu-Ray. But, I had also ordered this movie new when I received it the outer cover was not sealed and the inner cover which holds the dvds looked as if it was re-sealed. I wanted to return it already after i realized it was not Blu-Ray but the kids wanted to watch it so I ignored it. Well I take the plastic wrapping off the inner cover and look over the inner box cover and its damaged corners are dented in the bottom section is peeling apart. Now im really P/O but once again I ignore it put disk 1 in it skips twice put disk 2 in to finish the movie it skips once. So now i really beleive i was sold a used copy and told i was purchasing a new copy. Also the way this version is set up is so stupid Disk 1 and 2 are the movie disk 3 is all the special features. You put disk 1 in it ask you theatrical, extended or bonus version you watch the first half then you put disk 2 in ask you once again theatrical, extended or bonus. Why wouldn't you make Disk1 theatrical Disk2 extended Disk3 bonus and divide the special features between the 3 now your movie experience is not bothered half way through. Still one of my favorite movies just would not buy this version or from this provider again.
B006ZNRD06|3.0|Would be nice if it would play the videos smoothly. Audio was out a sync with video. Increasing buffer did nothing and I refuse to lower the quality of the videos I am watching.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Really loved it. Quite a different ending. Very engaging. A very unique perspective . I would recommend this book !
0486290492|5.0|Great for the price. The cover, however, is very susceptible to scratches. If you just need it for school, this shouldn't be a problem.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really enjoyed this show.  If you like intrigue, mystery, and conspiracy type stories, you will love this series.  The story line is great and each episode leaves you wanting to see the next one.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|the carry cover is well fit and ease to carry on on conditions. the headset is well protected inside the cover
044042335X|5.0|I've just discovered the Jack Reacher seires with One Shot and this is the second one I've read. At first, I was kind of turned off by the author because of his perceived arrogance concerning writers who don't get published by the big houses. A comment he once made didn't sit well with me, so I never bothered with his books until recently. I'll admit his stories, though with their own flaws, are quite good.<br /><br />In this one, Jack Reacher is the unconventional hero. A wanderer with a dwindling bank account, no home, no traces of his life anywhere, no personal possessions except a folding toothbrush and the clothes on his back, he gets a mysterious call through his bank account from an old comrade from the Army. When his old buddies are threatened, mayhem ensues.<br /><br />Though, Reacher rarely gets in jeopardy himself, as with most thriller heroes, he certainly dishes it out. There's plenty of puzzle solving and in this one we are bombarded with lots of math problems. Thankfully, the author spells them out because I'm lousy at math. The story unfolds in an enjoyable manner and I found it addicting.<br /><br />My only real beef was that the author didn't quite get his geography right concerning the Palmdale area. Since I'm from Palmdale, I was scratching my head more than a few times as he described the locations with the helicopter and travelling back and forth, especially near the end. Outside of that, I had no real beef with suspending my disbelief.<br /><br />Since there are seventeen in the series, I have plenty to catch up on. I've had to eliminate at least one though, because the author ruined it by writing in first-person. I don't know how many more he did that to but I hope not many.<br /><br />The exposition and narrative, outside of the sometimes extensive math interludes, was fast and didn't bog down. He didn't get near as passive as in One Shot and didn't seem to head hop that much, keeping the point of view fairly solid.<br /><br />As for this one, it was not a conventional thriller as the hero was rarely in any real jeopardy. However, the bad guys sure were! That's good enough for me. Highly recommended.e, it was not a conventional thriller as the hero was rarely in any real jeopardy. However, the bad guys sure were!

B005CRQ3RK|4.0|Great book at the end he, just wrote really big he had more space though  he just really cheated me out maaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnn
0312330537|1.0|It started out strong. Fascinating seeing the Bombay slums from the narrator's perspective. After lots of fights in which he kicks ass and self-congratulatory talk about his connection with the Indian common people, I started to feel a parallel with Mark Salzman's Iron and Silk. Both Roberts and Salzman are foreign guys with big chips on their shoulders who have an over-fondness for fighting, think of themselves as impressively brave in the face of physical hardship and bond in a semi-homoerotic way with their fellow gangsters or martial arts experts. All of this comes with a big dollop of corny philosophy and lots of cliche metaphors and bad prose.  Give it a pass.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Tom Cruise at his best...the movie has several moments that are action packed. I have watched it several times and really enjoy this movie. One of my favorites hands down.

B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie has it all in my opinion. very touching story, great romance, beautiful scenery (Ireland), gorgeous men (Gerard Butler, Jeffrey Dean Morgan), uplifting ending, although rather sad in parts, great acting (Hilary Swank is magical in this role!). It starts out slow but keeps getting better and better.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|i love this game but it has some problems...<br />it loads very slowly<br />and one time it wouldnt open so in order for it to work i needed to re install it and i lost everything!!!!<br />but other than that i cannot survive without this game.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|One of my favorite horror films. If you've seen it, you should want to own it. If you haven't seen it, you should. In the same vein as Return of the Living Dead, the film mixes horror and comedy seamlessly, and never drags. I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read this book at a good friend's recommendation, so I saw it through.  I found myself hating the characters and story line, and feel like I wasted my time reading this book.  Maybe the author's intent was to make us dislike the main characters, and if so she succeeded.  However, I couldn't find anything redeeming about the book.  I would not read anything else by this author.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|it lets me know how warm to dress in case i have to go outside!!  not always easy for someone who is old!!
B000003337|3.0|Then why bother? But Randy makes it special.<br />I love Randy's music and I love it in this.<br />But keep in mind its not Ozzy.<br />Although, I think Ozzy's music is closer to this style than his Black Sabbath style.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|While I have read this book in the past, I wanted to added it to my library.  I do plan to read it again in the future.
B008BO61BE|5.0|US Festival is a legendary show that must be seen.<br />Blast it loud! Just great.<br />I was 13 and wishing I could be there. I knew when they were to play onstage, but I was in San Francisco Bay Area at the time.<br />Now I can see it and its still is a hot mess.<br />CAN'T WAIT FOR OTHER BANDS TO DO THE SAME.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Since my kindle fire didn't come with an Calculator. I had to go and download one but this work great for me.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I stayed away from this movie for quite some time because I wasn't sure what to expect.. Last night, I took a chance and regretted waiting so long.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a really fun game and it really addicting and fast. It also a really challenging game too.
B005CRQ2Y4|5.0|This is my first try at Thomas Pynchon. He did not disappoint. Using a dictionary paid off handsomely. Pay attention to  the names of the characters. In a word: LOADED ! Excellent literature. Pynchon is right up there with another favorite of mine: Richard Yates. Sweeping depth and alacrity.
B009ME47H2|5.0|Got this so my class to record class lecture and it work great even better than i thought it would.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I fell in love with M83 last year, and I literally have not stopped listening to this album. It's addicting to say this least.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I couldn't watch every week last season & loved getting caught up before Season 3 started  I loved watching each episode back to back.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely adore this. it is the best time consumer for those among us who adore all things equine world.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Quite a few twists and turns until this story comes to a fitting end. Great trilogy. Too bad it sadly had to end.
1616550414|5.0|It's just pure amazingness for any super Zelda fan.  It has a lot of character designs as well as the game timeline.  There may be some who think they already know everything about Zelda and therefore think they don't nee....no...no.  You need it.  Just buy it already.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|GOT THIS COLLECTION AT A GOOD PRICE TO ADD TO MY BLU-RAY COLLECTION<br />I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE FAN.

B007THA4FI|3.0|The reader is introduced to all the residents in a small town so it is necessary to keep notes to remember who is who. It is a 'who done it' novel.
0679890475|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew, it was by far one of my favorite books as a young kid.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Once again I've gone bananas over this groups music.  I loved all the songs! Their music captivates me. Lyrics, melodies, harmonies and instruments are all superior! -  Sarah C.
B0086HGW42|5.0|He is an amazing performer and songwriter!! He songs come from true stories about is life. My favorite songs include small bump, drunk & you need me!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|A good action suspense movie, obviously developing the plot for a sequel, not that there is anything wrong with that.  My family enjoyed it, and I found the PG-13 rating to be appropriate.
B0091THRCU|1.0|Not only was it difficult to use, but the thread came out within a week and became useless. Not happy
1449410243|5.0|I had a good laugh for this one! Cat lovers will love this. I hope to see more of the Bobcats.
044655667X|4.0|I really like MIchael Connelly's legal series. The plot moves along, Haller is likeable and flawed. I am waiting for the next book in the series.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|INTENSE. DISTURBING. THOUGHT-PROVOKING. Some of the words that I associate with this movie. Watching it is a truly powerful experience!<br /><br />Something really did draw me into this movie--whether it was the acting, the directing, the story line  whatever--I really, really empathized with the main characters and felt, at some level, what they were going through. That's movie as art!<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson (I recognized him from \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\") were superb, and Woody Harrelson put in a memorable performance--running the gamut from quirky, calloused drunk to deeply caring mentor.<br /><br />I'm seriously considering adding \\"The Hunger Games\\" to my DVD collection, but I would definitely put it on the same shelf with my copies of \\"The Killing Fields,\\" \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" and \\"Schindler's List\\"--movies that celebrate the greatness of the human spirit when confronted with horrific evil.<br /><br />One lasting impression I will take from \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a heightened gratitude for the individual freedom we still have in this country--freedom from the despotism and tyranny portrayed in The Hunger Games' futuristic dystopia. Freedom is a precious gift--one to be treasured--and one that is relatively uncommon over the sad course of human history. Another lasting impression I will take from this movie is how it portrayed the disturbing propensity some societies have for viewing human misery and violence as a \\"spectator sport.\\"  It seems to me our culture is drifting dangerously close to that now in some of the violent video games that are flooding the market (and attracting big dollars), car races with their prospects of fiery crashes, and even football (a sport I have dearly loved as a spectator through the years) with its increasing incidence of serious, debilitating injuries. May heaven help us all if we as a society openly sanction and celebrate the misery of others as a valid form of entertainment!<br /><br />All told, The Hunger Games is a movie worth your while and your utmost reflection.s is a movie worth your while and your utmost reflection.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I got started late on this series so I was able to go from one book to the next without waiting... until this point. Ack! I'm still amazed at how fairly central characters are killed off, but it does, as some reviewers have written, give the sense that anything can happen and increases uncertainty and excitement, and perhaps a bit more &#34;realistic&#34;, or as realistic as a fictional-historical-fantasy series can be.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The book was recommended by some friends and for a book group. The story takes place in the south at a tobacco plantation.  Although an interesting perspective of a white slave, I found the authors version of the complexity of slavery in the south a bit too simplistic and somewhat racist.
