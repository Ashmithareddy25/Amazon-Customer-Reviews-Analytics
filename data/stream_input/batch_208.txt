B000055WIQ|5.0|This is what Regan says to an astronaut attending the party in the novel. This is one of those rare films that captures the essence of the book. If you haven't read the novel...please do so! As a child the imagery of this film terrified me. As an adult the idea of a demon/entity taking over me is disturbing. I especially like the scene where Dectective Kinderman is questioning Regan's mother about Burt's death.
0385484518|3.0|Tuesdays With Morrie, by Mitch Albom has a fairly simple plot, but many different aspects are covered in the story. The story revolves around an old man in his late seventies, Morrie, and his former student, Mitch, who comes back to visit him after he develops ALS, a disease that moves up your body paralyzing you as it goes.  Once it gets to your lungs, you cant breath anymore, so you die.  After Mitch graduates from college, he promises his professor, Morrie, that he will come and visit him.  Not until Mitch sees Morrie on television does he go and visit his old professor.  <BR>Despite Morries logical thinking and wonderful personality, unless you like books with sentimental value, youre not going to like this one.  This is the reason that I would not recommend this book.  It was way too sad and depressing to think that this bright, intelligent man with so many great memories is going to die, just like that.  The book was also a little slow.  It wasnt very exciting to read, so if youre into adventure, I wouldnt suggest that you read this book.
6304366078|5.0|If you don't like this film you don't have a passion for racing.  Unbelievable footage with the actors actually DRIVING the cars!!  James Garner (Pete Aron) is racing in the rain in Belgium at over 110 mph risking it all (Director Frankenheimer allows it) after Lloyds of London cancelled Garners life insurance policy because of a particularly risky fire scene that Garner performed a couple weeks earlier.  Film companies would never allow that these days.  There is only bad special effect in the whole movie.  Everything else is GREAT! Some amazing helicopter shots and on/in car footage and even a PLOT.  A real life racing soap opera with real racing going on in the FORE ground.  If you don't like this film you probably lack appreciation for human mechanical effort and challenge.  Its the best racing film ever made.  Noone else is even close.
0141301139|5.0|Roald Dahl is a master of words and his books are veritable treasure troves of rich vocabulary for children of all ages. While writing a unit on this book, I was challenged myself to find the contextual definitions of some of his words. \\"Cleverest\\" is one word, I think he probably invented (wouldn't it be \\"most clever\\"?), which can be found in these pages. Whether you're looking for a good book for a literature focus unit, a fascinating read-aloud for your students, or just a good read for your child (or yourself!), this book will be a hit!
0811826848|4.0|My wife gave the Anthology book to me for a Christmas present in '99 and I'm reading it randomly. There's a lot of info<BR>from Neil, Sir George and Derek, but I just wish that they had had more printed on poor Mal Evans. It's amazing to know that Mal and Neil were practically the only road crew that The Beatles ever used. Also I wished that Pete Best and Jimmy Nichol were better represented in this book. Overall, it's still pretty good and I'm glad it's reaching out to more younger converts.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Just Kidding!  But that is the whole premise of the film, right?  And yet it isn't offensive and it has a cute moral message of becoming the best that we can be.  Reese Witherspoon does a great job as a beautiful blonde who has never been expected to do anything more with her life than look beautiful, who then surprises everyone around her (including herself) by going to law school and suceeding.  Even though she goes to law school solely to get back her dumb social climbing boyfriend, in the end she recognizes her own worth and not only betters herself but also manages to nab a great new boyfriend (played by the ever adorable Luke Wilson).  So it is truly fiction -- pure entertainment that can only be enjoyed when you completely suspend reality.  But isn't that what we go to the movies for?

0671027344|3.0|While I write this, Wallflower had been #1 on the G/L chart for months and has received >400 reviews.  I figured it must have something going for it, so I got a copy. I think this story accurately captures a very awkward time in a dysfunctional 15 year old's life--but why all the crying? The 'infinite' scene was indeed the best one as has been noted. And while I was wondering why Charlie seemed so ineffectual while he was experiencing all these things, I was disappointed with the ending only because it was completely unexpected and perhaps a bit off the wall. Regardless, I would say this is a good read and would read the next novel by this author.
0345413377|5.0|In The Amber Spyglass, Philip Pullman brings His Dark Materials trilogy to a close with a big, sprawling, apocalyptic piece of work that ties up all those loose ends in a satisfactory manner... Satisfactory, that is, to anyone who is open-minded enough to accept new, imaginative thoughts. <br />In essence, there are two kinds of great innovative stories - those that fit new situations seamlessly into an existing body of thought and make you wonder why no one did it before, and those that do exactly the opposite and massage existing situations into a new line of thought. Then there are the third kind... the kind that only rise to the surface once every century or so... the kind that can take new situations and place them into a new stream of thought. Such is the trilogy of The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass. Imaginative, compelling, thought-provoking and innovative... no other way to describe them. Pullman is known for other fine works as well as His Dark Materials, but I'm willing to bet that these three books will be the ones he'll be remembered for. <br />The most amazing thing about The Amber Spyglass is that Pullman could, at any time, have taken the easy way out and written a happy ending... an ending that the church would have blessed and sanctified... an ending that the feminists would have been comfortable with... happy endings all around, in fact. The world is saved - God saved the world. But no! Pullman stood firm and allowed his characters to think for themselves. In doing so, he has taken the heat from all manner of religious fanatics. But this is REAL LIFE people, so you either accept that all three books were just a little fairytale with a difficult ending, or you accept that they were an analogy of life itself. Heads you win; tails you can't lose! Unless, of course, you're too closed-minded to see it.
6302424887|5.0|Having an ancestor named Macbeth causes a sense of duty in one. I wasnt a fan of Shakespeare,but went to see this film when it was in the theatres in the US. I felt I should,though Shakespeare didnt actually tell a truth in the play at all. Reality was quite different. Still,it was an awesome thing to view,this film. I went to the 11:00 p.m.showing so there would be not too many people or noise. Watching it,I was totally stunned to silence. It was a three hour deluge of violence,fury,jealousy,and murder. It impressed the Hell out of me! I came out of that theatre and just wandered home in a daze. Only one other film has ever shell shocked me like that. Macbeth has since been used in classes at many universities to teach Shakespeare,and I can see why. <BR>Most reviews deal only with the two principal players,Macbeth and his wife,but,there is another that figures highly in this drama/horror. Banquo. Martin Shaw did an incredible job of portraying him,his loyalties and fears.as did Jon Finch execute Macbeth with clarity and vision. Franchesca Annis did fine in her role,and was quite convincing in her insanity. <BR>An outstandingly powerful period piece,with all the right actors and landscape.

This book was extremely absorbing and gripping, and I could not put it down until after I had finished the shocking conclusion.<br />Do yourself a favor and read this book -- it's definently worth your time.

B00005U18E|2.0|This movie was an agreeable way to blow 90 minutes. Perhaps its greatest virtue is it encourages one to read or watch Pride and Prejudice (again).<BR>Please note: I have not read the book, Bridget Jones's Diary. <BR>Hugh Grant, as Daniel Cleaver, or Wickham-lite, provides the best comedy. Charmingly sleazy. I liked how he referred to Bridget Jones by her last name, so I'm going to have emulate him in this review. In my opinion he was under-used. Even when he gets his come-uppence in the office, with Jones making a crack and everyone ha-ha-ing at the boss, in his eyes you can see a witty report but on film he says nothing. A lost opportunity.<BR>Colin Frith is excellent of course. I find it difficult to describe his acting with his eyes when he is looking at the woman he loves. They show, at the very least, that he needs and wants her while at the same time exhibiting an uncertain pain and a questioning doubt of her ability to love him. A very similar look was used by him in A&Es Pride and Prejudice, incidentally, an excellent film. <BR>Renee Zwelleger was alright. She had some loopy charm (I really liked her frizzed-out 1980s coiffure), but very little depth--which didn't seem to be her fault, rather the script's. She looked great, its hard for me to believe so much fuss was made about the weight she put on. <BR>Several things were irritating about this film. In my opinion, having old people talk about their sex lives in order for the protagonist to show exasperated disgust and get a cheap laugh from the audience is lousy, desperate comedy. And several of the jokes seemed really dumbed down, like the audience couldn't figure out the humor without an arrow draw above it: for example, it kills the humor to have the mother introducing, hanging around, and then pointedly leaving Jones and D'Arcey alone together. <BR>The blaring love songs I can tolerate. However, the several slow-motions were ridiculous and unitentionally funny. It also seemed strange to me that the diary, in the movie anyway, is not very important at all, merely an afterthought. Only at the end does it provide a curve for the lovers to overcome.

0451169514|3.0|Like all of Stephen King's books, I had to plow through pages of description to finally finish this book last year, when I was in grade nine.  Do we really need all those pages devoted to listing the items in Eddie's medicine cabinet??  Ok, ok, we get it Mr. King...<BR>When I was done,  I sat there and asked myself if I truly liked the book.  I'm still not quite sure.  I liked the characters, they were well developed (possibly overdeveloped!), but the ending was SUCH a disappointment to me.  But, so was the Shining... and then again with The Long Walk.  (hmm, it's like there's a pattern).  I felt like after reading alllll those pages, he tried to finish the story too quickly, and left to many ends untied.  Plus, I was really peeved with how King chose to display It in the final scene.  Was I the only one totally confused with the climax??  <BR>In my opinion, I'm glad I read it.  It had it's terrifying moments!! But if I was going to recommend a Stephen King book,  I'd suggest Carrie instead.  Great novel!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I really don't know what to say about this album, I don't think I can categorise it in any way. I first bought this album (my first by Radiohead) as a recommendation and when I first listened to it I thought, what on earth is this? I didn't get it at all, I found it impossible to grasp. Why do people rate it so high, what on earth was all the fuss about? It only succeeded in giving me headaches. After listening to it for maybe a dozen times still finding it impenetrable I started to get hooked on a couple of songs and the rest followed from there. Theres some great music on here and I can't stop playing it, although if you were to ask me what the album is &quot;about&quot; I would have to admit that I havn't a clue - I think that this is a &quot;concept&quot; album, but I really don't get it at all, neither the artwork nor the lyrics mean anything to me at all. Having said that, the album is strangly compelling, my favourite tracks are &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; and &quot;Karma Police&quot;, although it's a true album rather than a collection of songs put together on disc, every track somehow adds to the cumulative effect. It's an album I just cannot stop listening to, although I'm not really sure why. Some people are saying they're the greatest band of all time, and that this is the best album of all time, etc - they and it are not, but this is a very, very, good album all the same. I just wish I understood it!
0553106635|5.0|I mean that!!! This book is the third book in a series that grabs and doesn't let go. It is a dark fantasy that is only dark because of its gritty realism. I've read many other authors and find Martin to be the best. Enjoy...
B00003CXCQ|4.0|There are so many laudatory things one could say about the film itself--the first American feature-length animated film, its use of the multiplane camera, color, realistic animation, characters, and so forth. I will not go over such familiar territory here. Suffice it to say, if you have not seen SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS and you are at all interested in either animation or pivotal moments in film history itself, then you should fill that gap in your knowledge. That being said, I will confine my comments to the DVD edition itself as it might appeal primarily to the adult animation/Disney fan.<br />First, there are a ton of extras here which include a range for almost anyone. Check out the list of contents--everything from an \\"interactive\\" ride with Dopey to archival material to technical information on the process of animation. Many other reviewers have listed their favorites, and I am no exception. A particularly nice addition is the Silly Symphony \\"The Goddess of Spring.\\" It's always nice to buy a feature-length film and get a short that helps demonstrate technical aspects to animation. Also quite useful were excerpts from the Disneyland TV show which focused on technical information, including \\"Tricks of the Trade.\\" This is a solid introduction to the multiplane camera. And then, for those of us who love paper as much as cels, there are production design galleries and posters from various theatrical releases. All these extras are combined in an easy-to-navigate format, which is much appreciated.<br />Before addressing the reason for my 4 star rating I should comment on the DVD's overall tone. It is almost excessively indulgent, whether when expressed in the Disneyland excerpts or the guest appearances. Disney knows and lets the audience know that SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a great product and that they also created a materful DVD. But it gets tiresome to hear how the world of Disney is so wonderful; the evidence should (and does) speak for itself. There is lots of shameless self-promotion here, much of it unnecessary and some of it irritating. More balanced commentary from historians and scholars like John Canemaker would have been preferable to the prescence of Angela Lansbury or the \\"Disney Through the Decades\\" cast; the \\"testimonials\\" felt like the actors were still under contract rather than offering heartful support to the film.<br />I know, you might be thinking \\"And shouldn't a company congratulate itself?\\" To an extent, yes, and I would agree that this DVD is well worth the money. But--and these are the reasons which are enough for me to withhold a 5 star rating (I would have given it a 4 1/2 if there was such an option--there are some omissions, additions, and errors that interfere with my enjoyment of the DVD as both a Disneyphile and scholar. Surely \\"The Old Mill\\" was worthy of inclusion as the company's multiplane camera test short! More information in the galleries, to finally giving proper attribution to studio artists, would better satisfy those who would spend time perusing such material. Did we need Streisand's rendition? Most distressing for me is the inclusion of the so-called Brother Grimms version of Snow White; I will simply say the version they provide is incorrect, altered for a Disney audience (to check out for yourself, look at Norton's Critical edition of tales edited by Maria Tatar). In such a carefully wrought work, such an error is careless and suspect. There is also the concern with navigational speed; it seems a bit clunky at times, though I am more than willing to overlook this for the wealth of materials that Disney does include.<br />Overall, the DVD is well worth the amount charged. It demonstrates the potential that DVD offers an informed audience and makes it possible for those new to animation or Disney to become an informed audience. I highly recommend adding it to your collection, even if you have yet to purchase a DVD player. However, I withhold a 5 star rating for its(rather obvious and unnecessary) omissions and errors, and its congratulatory, almost  smug tone.
B000056K04|5.0|I believe this album is just like every other DMB new release.  Most of his new releases do not sound a thing like the one previous to it.  Dave is constantly changing because most people get bored with the same.  If this album us so bad, then how come it is his best selling?  A lot of DMB fans say they do not like this album, I don't believe that it is the music.  I believe it is the popularity of the album.  DMB fans were very rare with the first few releases, and when their name grew so did their popularity, this is what I believe DMB fans do not like. That they are no longer a college band, but more universal. DMB fans like that they were rare, but not anymore.  This is a good album, and yes it is different, but that difference is still good.

0375704027|4.0|Having read most of Murakami's other works before reading Norwegian Wood, I was pretty surprised to read a fairly simple, realistic romance.  Although Murakami denies that this is autobiographical, one can't help but think that he based it somewhat on his own experiences.  Despite the different mood of the book, I believe that it would be a mistake to consider this book unrelated to his other works, as character traits of Watanabe, Midori, and Co. are found in many of Murakami's other works.  Midori's spunk and directness in particular can be glimpsed in a lot of Murakami's later characters.<br />As for the book itself ... although Norwegian Wood is supposedly a love story, I had a hard time seeing tender or romantic qualities in our protagonist.  Like many of Murakami's characters, Watanabe is at heart a realist, and a bit more selfish than the average Murakami \\"Everyman\\".  He has sex with pretty much every woman in the story so I had a hard time buying into his \\"love\\" for Naoko (he seemed more focused on her sexual prowess than her mind anyway).  I couldn't disagree with Nagasawa's drunken observation that Watanabe was like him in that he was incapable of truly loving anyone. Even when he declares that he can't do without Midori and never wants to be without her again, he goes and leaves her for a month after Naoko kills herself.  He even sleeps with Naoko's middle-aged roommate, Reiko.  Watanabe's ideals went out the window once he had a chance to take his pants off. When Naoko died, I found myself wondering if his sadness was because she died or because he lost a sexual outlet.  I couldn't help but feel that Naoko's gentle beauty was lost on him.  The older, wiser Watanabe that we start the book with seems to think along the same lines, but unfortunately, we lose his insight just a few pages into the book.<br />Norwegian Wood was an interesting read and likeable book, but not really the great literature Murakami's capable of.  Norwegian Wood was written around the same time as Banana Yoshimoto's \\"Kitchen\\" and I think it would be fair to make comparisons between the two.  That's not meant to be a knock on either story.  Murakami himself said he wanted to do something different in writing this book, which he certainly did.  A good book, but probably not among Murakami's greatest.he same time as Banana Yoshimoto's \\"Kitchen\\" and I think it would be fair to make comparisons between the two.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I am actually not a Dave Matthews fan, but, like many other reviewers, have not stopped listening to this cd since a friend told me about it in November.  I'm not a music buff, so I'll just quote part of the Rolling Stone review here instead: Mayer is described as both &quot;likeable and accessible&quot; and &quot;smart and affecting&quot; and given 4 stars (though I'm all for 5 myself).

B00005UKKF|5.0|Britney Spears is really an awesome performer. She can definately dance, you have to admit that! She is also a good singer. Just cause you all wish you could sing like her doesn't mean you have to put her down. I know you're wishing you had all the money she makes. And if you think people only like her so they can see her so called \\"Half Naked\\" body, then why did I think 2 of her albums go like Platinum? Its not like each CD shows her performing! Millions of people buy her CD's because she has talent. And the reason why in concerts she sings ALONG with the recording is because if she sang while breaking out with her awesome choreography, you would hear her voice be shaky because she can't do both at once. However, even as she said in an interview, shes still up their singing her bottom off. So please, if for some reason you want to put down an awesome performer like her, just keep it to yourself. She is good. Anyways, about the DVD, I saw it on HBO and I went to her concert in Atlantic City ((which was identical to the LV one)) and it was awesome! She sings songs from her new ablum, along with songs from Oops!...I Did It Again and ...Baby One More Time! It's a must have! Thanks

0375507507|5.0|This gifted author has the ability to recreate Africa with all its scents, sounds, and sensations. Alexandra Fuller has written a truly original and brilliant memoir of growing up in a white racist household in Rhodesia. Although her parents are blatant racists, as well as alcoholics, Fuller is able to make them sympathetic and even, at times, charming. Indeed, both her mother and father will suffer so in Africa that it's a mystery why they didn't pack up and return to England. You'll read each page marvelling at the language and emotions. Absolutely the best new book of 2002.
B000077VR3|4.0|I had heard a lot of good things from friends about MOULIN ROUGE and critics seemed to love it. However, the only promotions I had seen for the film advertised the sexuality of the picture and nothing else. That made me a bit leery. However, after finally viewing the movie, I'm happy to say though the film is full of sexuality (notice I said sexuality and not sex) it's a great movie well worth watching.<br /><br />The plot of the film, about star-crossed lovers separated by different lifestyles is an old one; but makes for a great story when told well (by the way, in MOULIN ROUGE the poor man wins the girl in the end, but in a slight twist, fate intervenes). And in MOULIN ROUGE the story is told exceptionally well. The scenery and costumes are marvelous, capturing all the lively decadence that was the Moulin Rouge. The altered pop music score and soundtrack is brilliantly done and one can only hope that future films choosing to use this format will be as well done.<br /><br />Many have praised and much ballyhoo has been given to Nicole Kidman for her performance and she may end up garnishing an Oscar because of it. However, Kidman isn't the real star of this movie. The real star is Ewan McGregor. He pulls off one of the finest and most believable performances of his career. Not only that, but man can this boy sing? Did anyone ever know how good his pipes were? He could easily pull of a Broadway musical and it would be a treat to see him try. Now, I'm not dissing Kidman; she gives a fine performance and has a difficult role. Nevertheless, McGregor has been overlooked and he's the one who really pulls off the better performance. Besides, it is his character (Christian) and not Kidman's (Satine) that the story really revolves around. The supporting cast is wonderful as well.<br /><br />As for the movie overall. The first twenty minutes are really strange and bizarre. After that, the pace picks up and things make sense.

0743201140|5.0|REVIEW: While I am generally disappointed with sequels, this book didn't disappoint and stands on its own (see \\"First Break All the Rules\\").  \\"Now\\" focuses on the individual (except the last two chapters) and their inate strengths.  It goes into detail on the 34 different types of talents/strengths that the authors found in their research.  \\"Now\\" is based on two simple themes: (1) each person's talents are enduring and unique, and (2) each person's greatest room for growth lies in their greatest strengths (not in improving their weaknesses as so much of our society is focused on). \\"Now\\" will help you recognize strengths (yours and other) which is the first step to capitalizing on them. I now find myself regularly thinking in terms of the strengths concept when making working decisions.  By the way, you don't have to read \\"First, Break All the Rules\\" before reading this book.  In fact, I recommend this one first!  Also, \\"First\\" focused on the manager and how he/she should think and act differently in terms of the authors discoveries on talents and strengths whereas \\"Now\\" focusses on the individual. <br />This book was also the first book that I've read that included an on-line component. The on-line test took me about 30 min to complete and gave me my top 5 strengths. After reading the detailed descriptions in the book, I believe the test correctly hit 4 out of 5 with the 5th one a close runner-up.<br />STRENGTHS: The book is easy to read and full of examples. I found the concepts and content very well thought out and very effective at changing my thinking.<br />WEAKNESSES: I note some weaknesses, but they were at most annoying and not significant enough to prevent me from enjoying or highly recommending the book. First, as in the \\"First\\" book, no index. Second, while the book has lots of examples, a number seemed to be thrown in to touch popular or emotional topics rather than being solid support for the specific topic being discussed.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: The book is probably best suited to professionals and knowledge workers with an interest in better understanding themselves and those around them. If you're interested in increasing your own effectiveness and the effectiveness of your relationships with others this book is for you.<br />ALSO CONSIDER: Of course, \\"First Break All the Rules\\" by Marcus Buckingham & Curt Coffman [either before or after this book]. \\"The Effective Executive\\" by Peter F. Drucker.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Well, it's not really a breakthrough - like Gloria Estefan (who co-wrote the English lyrics to \\"Whenever, Wherever), she was an enormous success in Spanish-speaking countries long before mainstream American listeners found her.  <br />For people who don't speak Spanish at all, the repetition of two songs in Spanish could be a bit annoying.  Putting the CD on \\"repeat\\" means that you hear the Spanish \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio,\\" followed immediately by its English version, \\"Exception.\\"  But for people who do speak Spanish, comparing the two sets of lyrics can be interesting.<br />Part of Shakira's mystique is that her background is half Spanish and half Lebanese (she grew up in Colombia).  The Middle-Eastern influence is clear in \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and \\"Eyes Like Yours.\\"  Also, her musical sources are broadranging - the rap bridge in the two \\"Tango\\" songs are so obviously inspired by \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\" that there's a detectable German accent.  The bridge of \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" features a \\"Penny Lane\\" trumpet fanfare.  And \\"Rules\\" could have been a lost hit from Blondie.<br />Like Abba's early work, if Shakira hasn't mastered English, it doesn't show.  Even native English speakers don't necessarily know that \\"silicon\\" is in computer chips, and \\"silicone\\" is in fake breasts.  (I won't ponder why two songs pay homage to her lack of an enormous chest)<br />There are songs that have the plaintive tone and wide vocal range of Alanis Morrissette, but the bitterness and excessive self-examination aren't there.  Which is probably a good thing.  <br />As I'm writing this \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" is the first and only single.  I can't imagine which one will be picked next - there isn't a weak \\"album track\\" song on here.  If you don't mind the two tracks that are repeated in Spanish, it's easy to put this on repeat and listent to it all night.

I think this book is an insparation to achieve in life to make dreams come true.  In this wonderful character of Paulo Coelho I found wisdom so closely.  This story dozzing in its simplicity Pyramids.  I'm waiting to see the movie because I want to see Santiago's picture on the screen.  Santiago learned how to survive and listen to his heart.  Sometimes I want to do the same things Santiago did.

B00005NGSD|5.0|If you are looking for commercial &quot;hair-band&quot; rock, this is NOT the CD for you.  The Scorpions outdid themselves on this release.  Taken by Force has it all...hard-charging rock, classic &quot;acid&quot; rock and beautiful ballads.  Every song on the CD is great, and since it also includes Suspendered Love (never released in the US) I can't rave enough about it.  I have the LP, and have waited SO long for it to come out on CD.  Taken by Force is my all time favorite Scorps release. It has proven to be elusive, so get it now before it disappears again.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you loved the movie it's a must to own this CD. It has all the music to bring back the magic of Moulin Rouge. There's not much else to say. I've found that no matter what mood i'm in there is something on the CD to fit it. God Bless and enjoy!
0062502182|5.0|Shortly, my personal opinion is that The Alchemist has motivate me to realize my Personal Legend.  Because, it has reminded me that there's a lot of obstacles that I have to face in life in order to realize my dream.  For this reason, I should never give up until I make my dream come truth.  Yet another, important thing that I've learn from this story is that I should enjoy the marvels of the world but not forget what I have.  Finally, I've decided to leave my family behind and pursue my dream until I reach my goals.
B00005QZWI|3.0|The music was very good.  Overall, i would give the music 5 stars.  fits the music very well.  However, if I could actually listen to the music on my PC, it would be great (which is why it only gets 3 stars)  My computer does not even recognize that there is music on the CD.  It only loads some webpage that you can watch enya interviews and whatever but there is nothing on the CD that actually lets you listen to the music.  Considering that my computer is my primary CD player here, that just takes all the fun out of having the CD
0395925037|4.0|Here it is, straight from the man himself. Called everything from garbage to a Satanic Bible, Mein Kampf is the written words of one of history's most important figures, Adolf Hitler. \\"My Struggle\\" was taken down in prison where Hitler was incarcerated for his failed Munich coup in 1923. Hitler waxes philosophical about his early life and aspirations, government, and a new program to lift Germany to dominance. The book is kind of tough to read at times, but other passages are remarkably lucid. This is probably due to the fact that it is a dictated account. There is endless repetition and congealed passages that will make you shake your head in incomprehension. I think the best hope for reading this book is to try and come away with the general themes of what Hitler is trying to say. Try not to get bogged down in the details or you're a goner.<br />Hitler begins the book by discussing his childhood. His father and him argued incessantly over what career Hitler should pursue. Hitler won by default (his parents died) and chose to pursue his dream of painting. He spent time in Vienna, where he began to form opinions on Marxism and Judaism. Long sections follow on Hitler's experiences in World War I, the Jews, and the failures of democracy. German foreign policy, along with its failures, is discussed in detail. Hitler never provides much evidence for his arguments, except for his condemnation of democracy, which is right on the money. Interspersed throughout his long discussions on politics and race are accounts of the rise of the NSDAP, or Nazi party. This is probably the most interesting part of the book, as Hitler outlines the growth of the party up until the Munich putsch.<br />I suspect most people will read this book to find out what Hitler says about the Jews. Hitler does discuss the Jews, mainly by outlining how the Jews gain dominance over the gentiles throughout history. Hitler sees Marxism as a Jewish phenomenon designed to enslave the Aryan world. The international financial system is seen as the cause of World War I. This same system is also described as a tool of the Jews. Hitler believed that the Jews sabotaged the German war effort from behind the lines. Jews are referred to as parasites and less than human. In general, most of the book is not about Jews, but concerns politics. The copy I bought was in the history section under Germany/Austria.<br />At times turgid and fascinating, you'll never forget reading Mein Kampf. I enjoyed this translation. I expected to see some raving monster. Instead, we see a political animal with some intense views. This book is must read for historians and World War II buffs.tional financial system is seen as the cause of World War I. This same system is also described as a tool of the Jews.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie was so brilliantly done that I can't watch it enough times.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sparkle together to create a wonderful love story of overcoming trials.  I recommend it to everyone I meet!

0060278234|5.0|This book tells of the life that a young girl has growing up in an orphanage not knowing who her father was and being abandoned by her mother when she was still very young.  As she gets older, Lirael hopes that she will get the Sight that all of the daughters of the Clayr recieve when the are becoming young women.  She notices that all around her, she is the oldest Clayr without the Sight.  With a turn of fate, she finds herself working in the library at the glacier where the Clayr live.  When she is not working she is looking behind locked and hidden doors that hide secrets of the Clayr, and more things than Lirael could have ever dreamed.  Even though she keeps her time occupied by work, she still has the emptiness inside of her, that only the Sight that she yerns for can fill.  After venturing through other hidden parts of the library, she finds herself being told to leave the glacier in search of answers and her future to be.
B00004UFYU|5.0|This is a great follow up to an amazing album.  The songs remind me of Enigma (obviously), but also with traces of Pink Floyd, Sarah McLaughlin, and Alan Parsons Project.  &quot;Misere Mani&quot; was featured on the first album, and is remixed here.  I find this album to be slightly more mellow (gone are the electric guitar solos), but what it lacks in hard rock, it makes up for in composition.  The songs are more beautiful, and the whole thing seems to have matured overall.  Plus, there aren't multiple versions of songs on this one, so it is far less repetitive.  If you are familiar with the first album, get this one!  If you're looking for an album to be introduced to the band with, this is the one!  The whole experience with this album for me has been like listening to Adiemus (Songs of Sanctuary) for the first time.  I was blown away, and had to listen to it over and over.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This has got to be the best and most fascinating movie made.  The computer animation is fantastic.  I have watched this movie every day since we got it two days after Christmas.  And I haven't tired of it yet (and I'm in the over 40 age group).  It's a complete pick-me-up.  I love all of the characters, especially Donkey.  I also liked the fact that after the Princess' kiss from her true love she did not remain the beautiful Princess.  Finally - a happy ending story that doesn't feature beautiful &quot;Barbie&quot; type people.  Granted I think this is more a movie for older kids and adults, but small kids will like the cute, lovable talking donkey and Shrek even if they don't understand some of the content.  The movie does have several good lessons to teach kids and that's to not judge people by their looks and what the true meaning of being a friend is.  How anyone can give this movie less than 4 stars I cannot understand when you consider the imagination, the technology, the hard work the makers put into this movie.  This should be a classic and I'll continue to watch this every day if I can. I don't think this movie can be topped!
B00003CXTG|3.0|While I highly recommend that people buy this DVD, it deserves much of the negative press it has received and should spur lots of discussion and critical analysis both outside and inside the filmmaking industry.<br />The fact that the producers, directors, and writers did such an incredible poor job in preparing the screenplay rivals any similar blunder in the history of filmmaking.  <br />The love story almost ruins the film, even some of the scenes between Evelyn Johnson (Kate beckinsale) and each of her two lovers (actually buddies since childhood) are absolutely pathetic, contrived to the point of becoming something out of a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale.<br />I certainly don't object to a ficticious love affair being inserted into what should be basically a docudrama, but this ridiculous triangle, involving Rafe (Ben Affleck) joining the RAF in the Battle of Britain, being shot down, escaping from a sinking plane, and a prison camp, returning virtually unannounced to surprise his former lover and boyhood friend is simply too stupid beyond words.<br />What I'd really like to know is why this screenplay was ever approved in the first place?<br />It's obvious that the filmmakers didn't want to simply remake \\"Tora, Tora, Tora,\\" but why not?  It's been thirty years and with computer assisted production techniques it would be certainly worth the effort.  Why didn't they take some time to more fully develop the Japanese expansion into China and Southeast Asia, as well as the isolationist climate in the United States?<br />Another weakness of the film is the second ending, Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo.  Alec Baldwin is not the least bit convincing as Jimmy Doolittle.  And, once again the screenplay stumbles by including the two buddies (Rafe and Danny) in the raid.  Of course, one doesn't make it back to the U.S.<br />What's good about this film?  Well, nearly everything else.  The special effects alone are worth the price of the DVD.<br />The accompanying extra features attracted me and added to my appreciation of the film.<br />Even though I come across extremely negative, I highly recommend this DVD, especially for collectors of World War II films.
0195067142|5.0|The best book I have ever read. His horrific accounts of the war are spellbinding, but at the same time shocking. He gets down to details of the war on the two islands.

VERY INTRESTING
B0000029DD|5.0|Without question one of the most important CD's of the last 20 years, Jeff Buckley's Grace is a masterpiece so soulful, strained and emotional that it demands your complete attention.  No wonder this album appeared on so many top 100 lists at the turn of the millennium.  <BR> <BR>I never had the chance to see Jeff Buckley live before he died but if ever a CD encapsulated the ephemeral light and life of an artist, Grace is that CD.<BR> <BR>I cried the first time I heard him render Leonard Cohen's Halleluiah with powerful and haunting sadness.  This is both a testament to the brilliance of Leonard Cohen as a song writer AND Jeff Buckley as an artist so singular that any song he touches becomes uniquely and unequivocally his own.  <BR> <BR>This is a CD of incomparable artistic integrity and unfailing thematic continuity that will leave you breathless for more, yet mournful because this gem is the only complete work he left us.<BR> <BR>BUY THIS CD!  I promise that you will not regret it.
0380788624|4.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. As usual, Neal Stephenson has served a delightful mix of technology and speculation that ties in with a slightly off-center cast to make a highly entertaining story. However, it suffers from the problem that much of his work does. The ending is abrupt, although not to the same extent as The Diamond Age. If the finish was executed better, this would be 5 stars.
B00005NWM3|3.0|yup, heard this before.  its an okay cd.  but nothing here to get all excited about.  if you like creed, staind, fuel, or anything along those lines, you will like the cd.  if you like how you remind me, buy it.  otherwise, spend your money on alien ant farm, incubus, or lifehouse.
B00005RZV4|5.0|I have hundreds of NIN bootlegs, and this recording is exactly what all of them are trying to be.  Trent always said that if he released a live album it would be the best one ever, and now that it's out, it's obvious he wasn't kidding.
B00001OH1S|5.0|What a great representation of the music from the movie.  I find Sting's cool version of &quot;Windmills of Your Mind&quot; better than the original.  Nina Simone's frenetic, (if a bit overlong) &quot;Sinnerman&quot; puts you right back at the Museum; &quot;Caban..&quot; does an equally good job putting you back on Martinique.  &quot;Everything&quot; is a steamy, sensual tune and Bill Conti's original embodies all the feelings in the movie.  I would have like to have seen more music from the movie, and lyrics to the foreign-language songs would have been nice, but the album itself is extremely enjoyable and it hasn't left my car stereo since I got it.  If you liked the movie, you'll love the album.
0679720200|5.0|This short novel is a classic of existentialist literature. The novel is divided into two parts. The first part takes us from the death of Meursault's mother to his killing a man. Throughout Meursault is quite indifferent to whatever does not directly effect his physical comfort. He is largely unmoved by his mother's death. His girlfriend asks if he loves her, he responds that he doesn't know what that means, but he doesn't think so. Meursault becomes friends with a shady character named Raymond almost as if he has nothing better to do at the moment. At last he kills a man on the beach apparently for no other reason than that the sun hit his (Meursault's) eyes in a certain way.<br />The second part of the novel takes us from Meursault's arrest to what is presumably a point near his end. The entire novel is in Meursault's voice and he is still in his cell at the end. He does not take us all the way to the guillotine. Throught the investigation and trial, Meursault is brutally honest. The trial takes on Kafkaesque tones when the prosecution is more interested in his indifference to his mother's death, his affair and shady friends than the actual killing. Self-defense is never suggested by the defense even though the man kill did pull out a knife. It is only in this part that Meursault is at all reflective upon his life, only when it is about to end. And it is only at the end that we see any emotion from Meursault. At the very end, he snaps at an unwanted priest's efforts to bring him into the fold before he dies.
B00005QG9J|5.0|this cd rules.  i didn't like the other incubus cd's that much, but this one is awesome.  i espcially love the bass and drums on it, they are awesome.  i dont know what to say other than you should buy at least two.  this cd rates up there with alien ant farm, lifehouse, weezer, seattle bands, and the counting crows.  its that good.
B00005B4GU|5.0|If you haven't heard this album, but are familiar with \\"Kid A\\" and are following Radiohead on their journey, you'll like this. My only complaint is that it's a bit short.. I mean, Radiohead branch off into so much territory, some songs just leave you wanting more and more. <BR>Listening to this album requires you to have an open mind; an appreciation of music no matter how it's made, or what genre it fits in/ignores. If you're still stuck in the mindset that any instrument other than guitar/bass/drums isn't worth listening to, move on. But if you're not a moron like many of these other reviewers, swoop on this album and expect the unexpected. Radiohead is finally ignoring the term \\"rock band\\" and just becoming a music group. Cheers.
6305807043|4.0|Being John Malkovich has the kind of frothy surrealism easy to conceive and terribly difficult to execute. Keeping the tone consistent and flowing is no mean achievement. The movie loses its momentum in its late stage when it tries to explain its plot. This is unnecessary, and only serves to conjure unwelcome disbelief. One movie that possibly inspired BJM, and did in fact manage to sustain its surrealist tone is Tom Schiller's Nothing Lasts Forever (1985), which was never released due to poor audience testing in Seattle. Seattle deserves a little seismic spank for depriving America of this neglected gem. The plot, as in BJM, takes place in New York sometime in the indeterminate future. The Port Authority has declared martial law, and struggling artists must negotiate with bureaucrats to fulfill their aesthetic labor. Stylistically, the tone is a retro homage to the New York of the late 1940s when bohemianism had an intellectual edge. Performers include Imogene Coca, Mort Sahl, Eddie Fisher, Selma Diamond, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Anita Ellis. What a shame this movie can't be seen!
B00000BKE1|4.0|You have to give this cd a chance. This isnt' one of those cds where you jump right in. Give it some time and you ll start to love it.

B000021YQV|5.0|this cd is excellent.  system of a down shows that you can rock, and still not sound the same as everyone else.  in a maket saturated with cry-baby-middle-class-... (see fred durst and aaron lewis) it is refreshing to hear this cd.  they are loud, but actually have something to say other than \\"... you, i rule\\" (see fred durst again) and \\"... you dad\\"  (see arron lewis).  and they aren't afraid to incorperate different instruments and sounds into their music, or have songs that, gasp, no way, sound different.  also, they get their point across without the use of constant profanities, showing that if you use that much profanity, you obviously didn't put much effort into your lyrics.
0780622553|5.0|Rufus Sewell is our befuddled knight in the altogether - at least as the movie unfolds. No idea whatsoever WHY this movie is so - so underrated, it is far superior to the \\"other one\\" [.......matrix.......], but somewhat similar in theme.<br />It's slightly Kafka, slightly Raymond Chandler, somewhat Clive Barker, and so much more. A detective story? Yes! A love-story? Yes! The art direction is superb, and so are the actors in various guises, especially Keifer Sutherland doing a chilling tribute to Peter Lorre.<br />There's also the lovely and finally recognized JENNIFER CONNELLY as the mysterious love-interest; Richard O'Brien [\\"Rocky Horror Show\\"], Ian Richardson the evil Mr. Book and William Hurt as the relentless detective searching for a serial killer - yes, that element is also present.<br /><br />Not confusing, neither frustrating, it's a unique world of deja-vu with a final gut punch that rivals the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\".<br />A must for the serious avant-garde movie fanatic - and an excellent companion piece to \\"The City of Lost Children\\".

0671027344|5.0|Growing up is not all roses as most of us remember. The novel shows the clarity of what it is like, the good and the bad. From innocent crushes, to being high for the first time.

078401213X|5.0|Pi is by all means a masterpiece of cinema. Aronofsky's noir film technique and photography are ingenius. The intensity of Pi reaches a level that very few directors can achieve. In an age when making films purely for money and forgetting about the artistic value of films are commonplace, Pi is a wake up call. When trying to describe the style and tone of this movie, I come to a loss of words. Stylistic images of horrifying beauty combine with an original and dramatic story to create Darren Aronofsky's first film, Pi.

0446605409|4.0|Plum Island is my third Nelson DeMille book and like the previous two I've read (Gold Coast and Charm School), it's a little long winded, probably 100 pages longer than it needed to be, but the primary character, John Corey is his best character to date.  I agree with other reviewers that he is arrogant, but he is pretty funny with his sarcasm, which makes him tolerable when the story drags.<br />The storyline, which deals with the murder of employees of Plum Island, where work is done with hazardous materials (including anthrax) is obviously very timely today.  It makes a lot more sense today than in 1997 when this book was first published.  You get to learn a little about this stuff, so DeMille's research doesn't go to waste here.<br />I found fault with DeMille's decision to let Corey figure out who the criminal was midway through the book and then spending the rest of the book showing how he gets this person.  It would have been nice if he threw in a plot twist somewhere later to shake things up and add some suspense, but it's a good book that will lead me to read The Lion's Game (another Corey book) in the future.
B00005R87Q|3.0|THE MOVIE:<br />The Story<br />\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" follows the story of an undercover cop, Brian `O Connell, infiltrating a street racing gang in hopes of uncovering a smuggling operation.<br />Movie Features:<br />Tons of fast and hot cars, \\"men's men,\\" some hot women and a pounding urban hip-hop, metal soundtrack.  This is definitely a guy's movie.<br />Downsides:<br />The plot isn't really well developed and to get the full story you'll probably have to watch the film a few times.  For example, you really don't catch what it is that Brian is really trying to investigate.  <br />Overall, with some of the themes in this film this movie probably isn't all that appropriate for kids and probably will not be enjoyed by the more \\"matured\\" crowd.  The movie upon it's release was somewhat controversial for it's glamorization of the illegal and dangerous \\"street racing\\" culture.<br />Plusses:<br />If you're looking for a fun, action filled flick this movie does the trick for you.  It's definitely high-octane and high-adrenaline with tons of fast racing scenes with fast cars and fast bikes, a handful of fighting.  Plus the hard soundtrack will make you want to get up on your feet.  Overall, if you're a guy who's young or young at heart, this is YOUR movie with some cool cars, hot chicks, etc.<br />THE DVD:<br />Like most new DVD releases this movie is just STACKED with tons of extras, some good and some \\"whatever.\\"<br />1. Commentary with director Rob Cohen:  standard fare...<br />2. Making of \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" documentary<br />3. Theatrical Trailer<br />4. Deleted scenes with director commentary:  some were pretty cool but the film isn't any better with them...alright feature...<br />5. Music videos:  Alright...<br />6. Special Effects Montage:  This was a cool video...<br />7. Interactive eight camera angle stunt sequence and Movie Magic interactive special effects:  Basically this just shows the different angles of the final scene in the movie with the train.  It's okay...but kinda \\"whatever\\" as you view it...<br />8. Lots of other features including DVD ROM features, you get the idea...<br />Overall, if you're really into the movie the DVD features are a nice mixed bag of cool stuff (commentary, special effects montage, etc) and some not so cool stuff.  If you're really into the movie get the DVD, if you are ambivalent it may be good for a rental or a pass.<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall, while this movie probably won't win anyone critical awards or make any \\"must-see\\" lists, this movie is good for what it is - a two hour diversion and entertainment.  This movie is probably best viewed by younger guys into cars, chicks and street music.  Anyone else may either take it or leave it...<br />Mildly Recommended
B00002NDNM|5.0|\\"Watch out!\\", the first words from Tom Jones' latest CD, Reload, serve him well. Reload is largely duets with other great singers, and it's a winner.                                                  <br />   At (likely) over sixty years of age, Jones proves himself more dynamic and entertaining with every new offering. Rather than mellow into his fourth decade as a pop icon, he cranks out blasting versions of songs like Lenny Kravitz' \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" and originals (\\"Sexbomb\\") that are designed for wild rumpuses. In a (rare) slower moment, his duet with Van Morrison is beautiful, but the tempo then picks right back up with Iggy Pop's \\"Lust For Life\\" and continues through and beyond a (live) version of \\"Come Together\\" that will give your subwoofer a bit of exercise. <br />       With the release of Reload +2, Tom Jones has, yet again, (see also The Lead And How To Swing It) proven himself to be much more than fodder for oldies stations. It's doubtful that any good party or road trip would be complete without this CD. Play it loudly!<br /> Scott Gordon
B00004HYLF|5.0|The whole album is a masterpiece, but the title track \\"Romantic Warrior\\" is the best fusion song EVER!!! Stanley's bass solo is actually so amazing that it gets hard to understand, Al and Chick's solo as well, and Lenny keeps that ... groove.<BR>The song builts up incredibly. To make it short - that's the perfect song for me - no words can descripe what I felt when I listened to it the first time and still I feel this special feeling while listening to it.<BR>That song gave me a musical orgasm. <br />Peace
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I have seen some...reviews of this album that have complained that the album plays like \\"name that influence\\". Those critics forgot one important thing about the origins of rock music, it got started as a ...ryhthm and blues of the fifties. I dare only to speak of that because Ryan Adams has already, in my humble opinion, set himself apart as a singer/songwriter. As fans of the first solo album, Heartbreaker, already know Ryan Adams may present misery and heartache in hs music but he does it in a very beautiful way. Many songs on Gold feature very good melody lines and choruses that will stick in your mind almost instantly. Anyone who can listen to Answering Bell and tell me they don't like it at all[!?]. With (hopefully) more music to come Ryan Adams seems set to claim his share of music history, just as long as these evil women don't get him first.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Ok.  First I want to say this to all you people who complained about the lack of plot, realism and dialogue saying that the movie is aimed at young male \\"idiots.\\" :  You are morons. If you didn't know that that was what the movie would be like going into it by the previews, then you don't even deserve the right to a complaint.  Perhaps you don't understand the the purpose of the movie: to see underrepresented import cars drive fast.  That's it.  That's what I payed for so that's what I got.  Sure, there is to much emphasis on \\"NOS,\\" but really, the movie achieved its goal as a fast-paced thriller involving cars not quite out of reach of the average American working class car enthusiast.  I know that I, along with many other young teens, loved to see the faster versions of the cars in our driveways rocketing down a city street at 150+ mph.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|....somebody's got to do something about that bad plastic surgery Angelina Jolie had done to her lips.  Sorry, other than the lip thing she's a prime fox.  It's just the unhuman, way oversized lips make ler look like a freak.  <br />Other than that?  It is a great cross between Indiana Jones and Terminator, with maybe a spice of Batman thrown in.  Very well done, overall.
0425180638|5.0|Patricia Cornwell's, The Last Precinct, is a continuation of Black Notice. Both of these books are very intriguing.  The story line is that there was a body found in a cargo ship in a Richmond, VA port from Belgium.  The body is thought to have been the son of one of the most prestigious families in France.  The body's brother \\"La Loup-Garou\\" is thought to have been on a murder spree in France, Virginia, and New York.  Kay Scarpetta is flown to France by jay Tally.  She has an intimate night with him that will forever haunt her.  Back in Virginia more murders happen that is thought to be La Loup-Garou.  Diane Bray, a hated policewoman, was brutally murdered.  Kay is thought to have killed her and made the scene look like it was committed by La Loup-Garou.  Near the end of the book Kay and her niece, Lucy, go to a motel that was the site of two murders.  They went to see if there was a connection to the death of a twelve-year-old boy.  While at the site jay Talley and the owner of the motel attack Kay and Lucy.  Jay takes Kay to a room were he beats her up and tries to kill her.  Lucy saves Kay's life.  In Kay's Supreme Court appearance where she was investigated for the death of Bray the truth came out.  Jay was La Loup-Garou's brother who was operating a drug cartel.  Jay and the motel owner fled never to be heard from again.  This is the last book in the Kay Scarpetta series.  I hope that Patricia Cornwell will continue with her outstanding books.
B000002OVJ|3.0|Not many people will stumble upon this review of a recording that is the embodiment of power trio rock. To have done so will probably imply a deep familiarity with THE WHO and the exalted place the original album has in the pantheon of live rock &amp; roll recordings.<BR>    For the sake of this review, lets's use the original as a basis of comparison. For the sake of brevity, let me remark that you'll be asthetically better off finding the album in a used record shop than buying this reissue that obliterates the rhythm, structure and visceral power of the original mix. Sorry, but this splice job totally ruins the Magic Bus denouement which made the original edit a masterpiece. In this case, more is less.
B00002SWEM|5.0|This is an awesome movie/concert. You can expect a rare glimpse into life in havana, cuba, and an historical overview of cuban jazz that came out of the 1950's. Americans rarely get to see Cuba, much less experience its rich culture and music (as we once did), and this DVD gives you the opportunity to do both. I have shown it to my students just to give them some perspective. I believe this is not only an emnjoyable film, but is also important.<br />The music itself stands alone and is undeniably excellent. After watching this film, my appreciation for cuban jazz multiplied. I saw Buena Vista Social Club perform in Atlanta over the summer in 2001 and their music was heavenly.<br />I highly recommend this DVD, whether you are familiar with the music or not. After watching it, you will want more of this music. ...And possibly even a glimpse of Havana for yourself!
B00005O3VC|2.0|This has to be the weirdest movie I have ever seen! It has cocconuts to killer rabbits. Now thats just silly! If you are a person who likes cartoon creatures or just one odd guy, heres your movie!
B00005NKCM|3.0|No one has to sell me on this story.  I've been waiting since dvd first came on the scene.  DVD better than Laser Disc (I didn't think it was possible).  &quot;Magic Casements&quot; episode must have had a chimp in charge of quality control.  I had my copy back to the distributor three times with no better results.  What I consider poor quality appears in the same places in all the copies I have viewed.  To me that says poor quality control.  I kept the series anyway because the story is still so good even after almost a third of a century.  Expect a good story but not all DVD's are created equal.
B00005QIPH|5.0|is this the savior of rock? i dunno, but its a really cool album, and its nice that something besides blink182 watered down pop punk is selling. i see this album as more of a glimmer of hope than the holy grail, but that doesnt mean its not good.
B000001DTM|5.0|In U2's incredible style, Achtung Baby easily rates as one of the bands' best works. Second only to The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby makes a bid for the best of the decade, not only by U2, but by any artist. What's amazing is that the album is a different sound than The Joshua Tree, and yet manages to solidify the band as one of the greatest ever. Popular songs like &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; are equally matched by less played songs such as &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; and &quot;So Cruel.&quot; If you're new to U2, it's not too late to enjoy their work. This album would sound brand new today--solidifying the notion that U2 was and IS well ahead of their time.
B00005NTJM|3.0|This Was sets the blueprint for the unusual sound that Jethro Tull would cultivate over the next three decades.  Tull plays heavy rock with a dash of medieval sounds mixed in.  Lead vocalist Ian Anderson has a powerful voice, but his flute playing gives Tull a sound like no one else in rock.  This Was is a solid, but not spectacular set buoyed by one great tune, &quot;A Song For Jeffery&quot;.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Aside from the bad acting and only one hot chick throughout the movie, the storyline is a complete and total rip off \\"Point Break\\".  Insert neighborhood families' beef for surfers', and heisting 18-wheelers for robbing banks as the ex-pres.  Paul Walker can't even out act Keanu's \\"I am an FBI agent!\\" in this one.  He let's Vin Diesel go in the same manner that Patrick Swayze is allowed to surf because they \\"won't go back man\\".  If you like cars, that could be the saving grace.  Otherwise, \\"Point Break\\" is still a classic that was poorly copied.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Jethro Tull hit their peak with their fourth album, the sterling Aqualung.  The album is full of meaty guitar riffs, sharp, introspective and vivid lyrics and minstrelesque melodies.  The title track is the band's most famous song and is a bona fide FM rock classic.  With its bombastic riffs, soaring flutes, mood shifts, it is a superb piece of rock.  But it is far from the only thing the album has to offer.  &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot; is a sturdy rocker while &quot;Mother Goose&quot; evokes a quieter mood.  The band goes introspective and questions many things on the tracks &quot;Wond'ing Aloud&quot;, &quot;My God&quot; and &quot;Up To Me&quot;.  &quot;Hymn 43&quot; is a powerful rocker and may be the best song on the album.  &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; is another FM rock staple, thanks in large part to its smoking guitar and propulsive beat.  Aqualung is the band's crowning achievement and a 70's classic.
B00005RZV4|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet: this CD is incredible, especially for those who saw NIN in concert on the Fragility tour.  The raw energy that always comes through on the studio recordings doesn't hold a candle to that of the live recording.  <br />For those of you who are already fans of Reznor's genius, I have only this to say to you: get the Deluxe Limited Edition with the bonus disc, .still.  It contains some amazing &quot;acoustic&quot; (if you can call it that) versions of &quot;Something I Can Never Have,&quot; &quot;The Fragile,&quot; &quot;The Becoming,&quot; and &quot;The Day The World Went Away&quot; as well as some brilliant new additions to the NIN repertoire: &quot;Adrift and at Peace,&quot; &quot;Gone, Still,&quot; &quot;And All That Could Have Been,&quot; &quot;The Persistence of Loss,&quot; and &quot;Leaving Hope.&quot; (Some of these may have been previous releases, though I don't think so.  I am a serious NIN fan, though my diligence faded during the dark years between Downward Spiral and The Fragile- Sorry, Trent.  It'll never happen again)<br />For those of you who have not yet discovered the brilliance of Mr. Reznor, this may not be the best place to start.  While the CD is great, your best introduction to their music would probably not include the band performing with the accompanying voices of thousands of teenagers.  I would reccomend starting with everyone else's favorite &quot;The Downward Spiral,&quot; or my favorite, &quot;The Fragile.&quot;  Though it may not be a bad idea to pick the Limited Edition 2 disc set up now - in case it is, in fact, limited - and perhaps store it away somewhere.  After you fall in love with the music, you'll be wanting it.<br />While I did give this version (which is the first disc of the 2 disc set only) 5 stars, I must reiterate this suggestion:  Get the Deluxe Limited Edition with the bonus disc instead!  If this version is 5 stars, the Deluxe version is 8!
B00005NTJK|4.0|1970's Benefit strongly follows up 1968's Stand Up with more solid music from rock's minstrels.  Ian Anderson has his strongest vocal effort to date and the band is in fine form on such standout songs like &quot;To Cry Your Song&quot;, For Michael Collins, Jeffrey &amp; Me&quot; and &quot;Nothing To Say&quot;.  The best song on the album is the propulsive &quot;Teacher&quot; that ranks among the band's best songs.  The album was their breakout in the US peaking at number eleven on the charts.

B00005OM4Q|5.0|&quot;Almost Famous&quot; is Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical story of how at the tender age of fifteen, he went on the road as a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine. It is also one of the finest movies ever made about the golden age of 1970's rock n'roll. Crowe's alter ego is William Miller (played admirably by Patrick Fugit)who goes on tour with the fictional band, StillWater (a composite of real life rockers the Allmand Brothers, Eagles and Led Zepplin).It is here on the road he must deal with his domineering but loving mother's phone calls, groupies and musicians with outsized egos.Throughout the film William walks a fine tightrope between becoming friends with people who are his heroes and maintaining his journalistic integrity. This film is a brilliant meditation on why we like music and what is the meaning of being a 'true fan'. &quot;Almost Famous Untitled&quot; is Crowe's director's cut of the film.The grapics of the packaging and on screen menus are made to look like that of a 1970's bootleg rock album. It includes over thirty minutes of footage not seen in the original theatrical or initial DVD release. In most films, scenes and dialogue have been originally deleted, because of pacing or the fact that they do not contribute to the story. Many of these director's cuts feel padded and have been put out just to make a quick buck off of fans. This is not the case with &quot;Almost Famous Untitled&quot;. Crowe's additional footage greatly adds to the story and gives us a greater understanding to the motivations and emotions of the characters. I would say this is an improvement over the original cut.This edition also includes many more extras then the initial DVD relese. One glaring ommission from the first DVD release was it's lack of commentary track.This edition makes up for this with Crowe giving us a both inciteful and hilarious commentary with his real life mother. These two laugh and reminice with great chemistry and make it very obvious, that their relationship was accurately captured in the movie. Also included are a variety of other deleted scenes, trailers, concert footage etc. If you are a fan of 1970s rock n'roll then this is the movie for you!elationship was accurately captured in the movie. Also included are a variety of other deleted scenes, trailers, concert footage etc. If you are a fan of 1970s rock n'roll then this is the movie for you!
6303215734|2.0|The colorized version of this timeless holoday classic is a complete desecration of the original  black and white presentation. The garish washed out colors (done in 1988 by Colorization Inc.), destroys the shadow and picture contrasts and kills the entire mood and tone of the film.<BR>   Go with the original black and white version. You will enjoy the pathos of George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who attempts to commit suicide after a financial breakdown but is stopped by his guardian angel who shows him the importance of his life...This is a true holiday classic that is strictly meant to be seen in B&W!!!!!!!

B00005RHGK|2.0|I love horror movies. I really do. So, since \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" was a horror movie-yep, you guessed it-I rented it. The movie was going along fine-mighty fine. It had its moments of scare-but nothing, nothing like \\"The Exorcist\\" (This movie scares the heck out of me, even at my age!). The worst came at the end of the movie...all I could say about it is...STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID and a thousand times STUPID! I really, I really hope the ending was made like this because there is going to be a sequel.. I mean-what's the point of an ending like that if you don't make a sequel? Another bad thing about the movie are two items: Who is \\"The Creeper\\"? Where did he come from? WHAT he is? Why does he kill every 23 years? What's the song have to do with him? If he's some type of animal-how can he whistle? Who really is Jezelle Gay Hartman? There were a lot of questions that unanswered at the end of the movie-and that's another reason the movie [was bad]. Well-unless there's a sequel to it-I would probably change my mind about \\"Jeepers Creepers\\"-so, we're just gonna have to wait and see what Hollywood has in store.

0679720200|4.0|Goddammit, I LIKE this translation!  I wish people would stop putting it down.  Although it has none of the poetic beauty of the other main translation, that is the WHOLE POINT!  Read it in the French or have someone translate it for you (for the French- impaired, like me) and you will realize that part of the book's power is the stark, straight-to-the-point style of writing.  Camus is a genius, and this translation is truest to his original words.  Prepare to be shocked, entertained, amused...and ultimately to see yourself in this book.  (Or worse, NOT to see yourself...)  This is most definitely worth your money and your time.

I would recommend this book to anyone who just wants to read a good book.
0553712837|2.0|The whole idea of the novel was a good one considering it was John Grisham.  I liked the novel as it took off but also got a bit lagging and boring.  The book was also one of the big hits in the literature industry but as more and more people read the book, they figure out what it's really about. Luther and Nora Krank, the parents who decide to skip Christmas, love and sacrifice their trip for their daughter Blair.  I think that Blair is on of the characters that I enjoyed because she seemed to changed the novel and give it a big kick about the book.

B000002MG1|5.0|Let me explain what I mean by the title of my review.  Ten years, when I was a senior in college (my, how time flies), Rolling Stone back then (and even now) gave &quot;Automatic...&quot; a five-star rating.  One of my roommates at the time was an R.E.M. fan and bought the CD.  Out of curiousity, I gave it a listen.  My initial reaction was that it was dull, boring, and dry to say the least.  At the time, I could not understand how RS could give it five stars when at the most, it deserved probably no more than three stars.  If I recall correctly, &quot;Drive&quot; wasn't too bad (it was a single back in '92) and &quot;Ignoreland&quot; was the only other good song.  The rest was bland and mediocre.  Or so I thought...<br />Well, over the years, I've heard two other songs from &quot;Automatic...&quot; played on the radio over and over again, namely &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and &quot;Man On The Moon&quot;.  And those songs grew on me.  Finally, at a friend's place in Chicago last year, I stumbled across the CD once more and decided to give it another spin.  For some reason, it finally hit me!  I liked it!  All I can say is my view towards this album has definitely changed for the much better.  And I'm glad for that!  Reason being is that apart from growing older, the songs have a certain maturity to it where people like myself can relate to then at a certain point in life.  Throughout the whole CD, themes of loss, hopelessness, and desperation are mixed in with themes of faith, hope, and love.  At times, you can hear the solemn desperation in Michael Stipe's voice while at other times you can hear the hope and encouragement knowing that things will get better (to me that's what it sounds like).  Out of all the R.E.M. CD's I have (I have only five of them), this one by far is their best!  If I had to name the most outstanding tracks, they would be &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and &quot;Nightswimming&quot;.  &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; is a song that certainly everyone can relate to.  Let's face it, who hasn't felt alone and misunderstood?  There are people who do care about your well-being.  By keeping the faith and hope alive, things WILL get better!  Everyone should listen to this track at least once!  As for &quot;Nightswimming&quot;?  It's the BEST track on the whole CD!  I have not heard a more stunning gorgeous song in the longest time!  The combination of the piano and strings and Michael's voice makes this one a winner, hands down.<br />So there you have it.  &quot;Automatic...&quot; is a quiet, reflective, introspective CD worth listening to.  If you had to get one R.E.M. CD, you should AUTOMATICALLY get this one! (pun intended)can relate to.  Let's face it, who hasn't felt alone and misunderstood?  There are people who do care about your well-being.  By keeping the faith and hope alive, things WILL get better!  Everyone should listen to this track at least once!

B00005LQ04|5.0|I was amazed when i first popped the discs in my DVD player. The picture and sound are incredible and must be experienced to be believed! You've never seen Suspiria like this before. The extras are a great bonus with trailers, TV spots, radio spots, 100+ stills and photos, in depth cast bios, etc. The 2nd DVD disc contains a 52-minute documentary for the 25th anniversary. It contains interviews with Dario Argento, cast members, etc. I found out quite a few things i didn't know about the movie from watching that. The 3rd disc is a CD of the original soundtrack by Goblin and i think it features a few bonus tracks (remixes). If you're a fan of the movie then you really can't go wrong with this great set!
0767809246|5.0|This 1986 film directed by Rob Reiner is, without a doubt, the best film adaption of any piece of work from horror maestro Stephen King. However, this isn't the usual King/horror story. It's a magical journey back to youth and the fun adventures you'd have as a kid. Not to mention the bonds you develop with your closest childhood friends. The movie takes place in the 1950's where a group of friends decide to go on an overnight adventure to find the dead body of a boy who was hit and killed by a train. During their journey, the young lads have a few of their own scary encounters. The young guys are all played very realisticly by Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and the incredibly slimmed down Jerry 'O' Connell. Along the way, they encounter the town bully, played wonderfully by Kiefer Sutherland. The movie is narrarated by an adult Gordy(Wheaton's character), who is voiced, and played, by Richard Dreyfuss. I have always thought Dreyfuss had a great voice, and it is put to great use here. It's a special movie that will rekindle fond memories of your own childhood. Most people might not of gone on such a big and odd journey as these guys, but I'm sure almost anybody can relate to that special time in life. Reiner did a great job. Watch out for a cameo appearence by John Cusack. A great American classic.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This low-budget cult classic horror spoof has one of the great movie titles of all time. Mike (Grant Cramer) and his sweetheart Debbie (Suzanne Snyder) are smooching on lover's lane when they see what appears to be a meteorite crashing over the horizon. They loosen their liplock long enough to investigate and find a curious circus tent. There they discover malevolent clowns who stop their victims with popcorn-shooting guns and acid-drenched pies in order to feast on human blood. The unfortunates are then entombed into inescapable cotton candy cocoons. Officer Dave Hanson (John Allen Nelson) is called to investigate with help from Officer Mooney (John Vernon). For those viewers who already think clowns are a little creepy to begin with, this one will push them over the edge.

He unwillingly takes on a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) as his sidekick as they journey to free a princess (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon. Along the way, they manage to have a lot of fun with the traditional nursery rhymes and bedtime stories that most of us heard when we were children.<br />Unfortunately, they also have a little too much fun with double-entendres and body noises, which makes this a film which parents should watch with their children (if they even allow their children to watch). Without a doubt, it is not the animation that Walt Disney would have imagined in the 1950s. Rather, it is a cleverly designed tale which engages the minds of adults while tickling the visual senses of the younger generations. (The Gingerbread Man/Muffin Man scene alone makes this movie worth watching).<br />In the realm of DVDs, &quot;Shrek&quot; also establishes itself as a cut above. The menus are incredibly interactive, and even entertaining. The several features about the making of &quot;Shrek&quot; are definitely worth watching, and the &quot;karaoke&quot; video (which appeared after the credits in the theatrical release) is available for viewing by itself. This is definitely worth adding to any DVD collection.

But,I didn't really like all the fiction I'm into nonfiction.  However, this story was great and I think people should read it.  If, they like fiction books.

B00005JKQX|5.0|this is a must see movie!  <BR>there are no words to say to express how much you will enjoy this movie.
B00005RHGK|2.0|While &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is obviously in the hands of a skilled writer/director (Victor Salva), one can't help but feel an odd sense of deja vu when watching the film play out. The set up, or the film's first 30 minutes, is terrific. The resolution however, is typical. It's odd this film would have received such glowing reviews from the nation's critics, though one suspects the presence of Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios to be a factor. &quot;If they made it, then it has to be good!&quot; It's really not.<br />Two siblings returning home from college decide to take a detour down a lonely country highway. We know this wisecracking pair, a brother and sister, are going to encounter horror, since this is a horror film. But the way they encounter the horror, in the form of an ominous demon with a taste for human flesh, is always suspenseful and surprising. From church basements to rooms littered with dead bodies, this unlucky pair is in for a nightmare of terrifying proportions.<br />Unfortunately for the viewer, the nightmare is far too reminiscent of &quot;Friday the 13th,&quot; &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and, most noticeably, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&quot; And don't forget to throw in &quot;Duel&quot; for good measure, as this demon prefers a juiced up truck bearing what seems to be one heck of a loud fog horn.<br />While the kids in this film undoubtedly make some of the stupidest mistakes in the history of horror films (returning to scenes of crimes, observing crimes rather than running), I was never really distracted by this. I also appreciated the fact that beautiful young woman were never the victims in this film. In &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; men seemed to be suffering far grislier fates.<br />What bothered me was an especially abrupt ending at the police station, a lack of explanation for why this demon was scooping up victims off the highways of Florida and the overall geekiness of Justin Long as the brother (though I think this was intentional). In fact, Mr. Long irritated me so much that the creepy conclusion amused me more than anything else.<br />I thought Gina Philips as the sister was terrific and hope to see her again in the sequel, or perhaps a better film. Her performance was natural and commanding. It was perhaps the best aspect of &quot;Jeepers Creepers.&quot;<br />As for the demon, well, been there done that. It certainly is not something I would want to meet in a dark alley (or on a lonely highway), but one can't help but wonder if this is yet another attempt by moviemakers to produce a title monster followed by an endless line of bad sequels.

0671449028|5.0|I bought this book based on reviews and got no huge reaction when my daughter(2) opened it at Christmas.  However, the first time we read it, she started memorizing it.  The second time:  she took the book, went away and sat by herself \\"reading it\\" over and over.  <BR>The book tells of a variety of cutesy animals(on a boat) getting ready for bed.  They go through the ritual of taking a bath, hanging up their towels, finding pajamas, brushing their teeth and then the much controversial exercising.  The boat part I thought was a little weird at first but how else are you gonna rock an elephant and a hippopotamus to sleep?  <BR>This book didn't help my kids go to sleep or even get them to pick up their towels but it sure brought out a lot of conversation and excitement about reading.
0385505833|5.0|So many reviewers have attacked Grisham for daring to step out of the Legal Thriller Category where he has made such a mark. Give me a break!  This is a great little book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a lighthearted spoof of life in America at Christmas time.  Is there a better time of the year to enjoy a humorous tale?<br />I smiled through the entire second half. There are several unexpected twists along the way as the Kranks prepare (and not prepare) for Christmas.  Luther Krank is determined that their first year as empty-nesters is going to be like none before. He succeeds in a hilarious manner.<br />My advice, if you are looking for a legal thriller, skip this one.  But if you can use a good laugh, don't miss Skipping Christmas.
0671042858|3.0|This slim volume is really a &quot;novella&quot; (which, I believe, is Spanish for &quot;short story at full-length novel price&quot;) and its brevity acts as a sort of defacto editor which reigns the author in to some extent and makes for a more straightforward tale than one might expect -- especially given the outlandish, everything-including-the-kitchen-sink nature (&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;,&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;) of King's other recent work.  But the ending disappoints, like a slider that gets a bit too much of the plate and all you can do is watch helplessly as the ball leaves the yard....
B00000JZC4|4.0|Let me begin this review with a story, <BR>One afternoon i was waiting for the town bus on the main avenue in my hometown. I was wearing a pair of headphones with the filter cd title of record in the discman.I had a good spot on the steps of a store that had closed down a few months ago.I noticed that the bus was running awful late but i was really not caring. This cd provides a listening expierience that may send you to another world. a trance. which is what it did to me, the well composed music sent me into one that made me listen to the cd once + 6 songs for a second time to realize its sunday, and in my town the bus dont run on sunday. <BR>i included this little story not to run the review but to give you an idea of my introduction to the cd.<BR>The songs do run long but i think its because all of the music is well composed. giving you bridges like the &quot;mama give me my medicine to make me feel like a taller tree&quot; to give you a full spectrum of emotion. i like it for the most part but i am its not something all of you adrenaline lovers may. &quot;welcome to the fold&quot; is a great song. an addicting riff which is all you really need. 7 minutes of everything. the only problem i can see is their eccentricness can be a tad annoying. <BR>my favorite song is captain bligh. its one of those songs, well in fact filter is one of the bands where the whole song builds up more and more toward the end. if you want another example of it would be in the &quot;live&quot; cd &quot;throwing copper&quot;. the chorus is always stuck in my head &quot;I am a greiving man<BR>I can't believe the things I've done to you&quot;]<BR>lets skip to &quot;the best things&quot;, of course the 3rd radio song, fast moving, very swift this song is, and as the verse rolls on it all comes down to the loud scream &quot;NOWHERE&quot;. the instruments are great, it seems the kouder you listen the better they will become.<BR>&quot;take a picture&quot;, their radio hit, i like, but i dont like filter when they are so sweet like that. stick your your strength, its still pretty sweet.<BR>&quot;skinny&quot; gives you a nice slow verses and a nice harder chorus, it almost blew me away<BR>cancer is one of my favorite songs. a very sweet chorus and some good rhymes <BR>as for miss blue i would rather just listen to the dead 10 minutes and the weird sounds
0684867621|1.0|THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON not only isn't on par with King's other novels, but, in my opinion, is one of the [worst] books ever written...<br />The story is about a small girl who -when accidentally separated from her mother and brother on a nature hike- becomes lost in a Maine forest wilderness for several days, and the perils (or imagined) that she encounters during this time.  99% of the book covers her adventures in the forest while she is lost, and believe me, the story is even FAR, FAR more boring and uninteresting than you may think, considering how simple the plot is.  Basically, all this book does is describe this girl's day to day experiences in the forest such as: eating poisoned berries and vomiting them up, listening to Tom Gordon pitch for the Red Sox via her walkman-radio, flee from an imaginary creature, vomit some more, etc. etc.  The story drags on and on and on and on and it never becomes either interesting or suspenseful during any stage of it.<br />Other than sparse profanity here and there (uttered by the little girl -who talks to herself and apparently learned to swear from a classmate) this is totally a rated G little kid's book, and it's the most insipid kid's book you will ever read in your entire life, by far.<br />Reading this book, one will be hard-pressed to believe that it is Stephen King material; it's untalented, extremely boring, and nearly completely devoid of suspense...Don't make the same mistake I did.  Reading THIS...will be the biggest 4 or 5 hour waste of time in your entire life.
0553801481|3.0|Some parts are very good.  The premise and overall plot are quite believable.  But there is way too much focus on animals - especially cats - as characters.  If you don't think of cats and dogs as little furry people (blecch) you might want to skip this one.  Also, there are allusions to Hedge Magic but it is largely undeveloped - probably for the best because this part comes uncomfortably close to the sort of embarrassing content you'd find on a sixteen-year-old's wiccan/pagan web site.  And if hedge magic were as generally effective as this work suggests, its use would be much more pervasive in the society.  Three stars because she develops the (former) Fool well as a character, and the former Fitz character hasn't become weak enough to taint the memory of the excellent Assassin series:  note however that the former Fitz spends most of this tome as weak hand-wringing effeminate lackwit.  This book could have used a few more passes through an editorial process.
B00003CY5J|4.0|I'd give this 3.5 stars.<br />This is certainly an enjoyable film and it has it's moments, but given the caliber of the actors involved, I had expected more.  There's enough action to keep the movie moving along, but it doesn't take Felinni to see where it's headed fairly early on.  The video and audio quality are fine.  The audio is less dynamic than many modern movies, but that's OK since this wasn't meant to compete with bombastic titles.  Plus, it means that you don't have to rack the volume up to hear the quieter conversations, then back down during the loud scenes.
B000002INR|5.0|I agree with pretty much every review on this album except the ones that call Skid Row a hair band. Any one who knows a damn about rock 'n' roll knows hair bands are Poison and other .... I mean Skid Row toured with Pantera and are good friends with Slayer. Well with that out of my system, I can actually review the album. If I am in a bad mood I put this CD on. It automatically puts me in a better mood. Not that it's all happy b/s! This is great for parties, or anything really. My favorite is probably \\"I Remember You\\". Bach is so good at what he does that in recent years he performs on Broadway! That alone should make you go out and buy this awesome metal debut.

And as we watch the perfect paradise decay into insanity and blood shed we begin to see the accuracy of the comparrison.
B00001ZWTT|5.0|WILD WILD WEST is one of the first films to take full advantage of the DVD format. From a visual standpoint, seeing this film initially in the theatre I just felt that too much emphasis was placed on special effects (which are now mostly computer generated) and development of the story and characters was sacrificed to this end. Subconsciously the viewer knows that many of these effects no matter how realistic they look can not be photographed because there is really no vantage point to place the camera. Our minds are just too sophisticated to accept this especially when seen on the large silver screen in a theatre. Somehow on TV these effects just seem more acceptable and palatable.  Perhaps it is all those commercials that are now filled with CG effects and proliferate our TV sets. In any event WILD WILD WEST looks great on TV and putting aside all the special effects it plays out as a very entertaining Western made from the same mold as the original TV series. It's basically a story of two secret service agents  (Will Smith and Kevin Kline) who report to President Grant. They travel by way of their own personal railway car and locomotive across the country pitting their talents against a villain (Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Arliss Loveless) who utilizes Twentieth Century technology in an attempt to conquer and rule the West. Director Barry Sonnenfeld has taken this format but now pits our two heroes against each other to see who will win the girl (Salma Hayek) and who ultimately get Loveless by the end of the film. This is a similar plot device that Sergio Leone used in successfully in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. As Will Smith and Kevin Kline develop in their roles they learn that they must combine their talents to defeat Loveless. Kenneth Branagh gives a brilliant performance as the devious and twisted Dr. Loveless that somehow strengthens the resolve of both Smith and Kline. There are some great moments in this film of action, surprise, comedy and bravado. All this is enhanced by Elmer Bernstein's first rousing Western score in years. Despite the science fiction elements Bernstein focuses his score on the West and Dr. Loveless' post Civil War Southern homestead. As for Will Smith's great performance of the WILD WILD WEST theme song, you can hear that over the closing credits and on the complete version of his music video included on this DVD. I thought this was a very enjoyable film. I have watched it several times. I just can't believe this is the same film that I did not enjoy in the theatre.hanced by Elmer Bernstein's first rousing Western score in years.

B00005QIPH|2.0|I like keeping my reviews relatively short, ergo: Two words: Overrtaed.  I suppose it was inevitable after the overwhelming hype they got from every possible angle.  It's amazing how un-cool music can become when all we hear about is that this band marks the \\"return of rock and roll.\\"  Analogy: I once had a friend who weeks after being dumped by his girlfriend, kept telling me on a daily basis that he was finally over her.  This went on for weeks, and his opinions on the matter were always unsolicited.  Thankfully, it eventually stopped after some time.  Afterwards, I had to point out that if you have repeatedly tell people that you're over someone, guess what, you aint over them.  Same thing with this band.  If every music critic and \\"hip\\" DJ in America have to say how spectacular and revolutionary they are, they just aren't all that spectacular...

B000002U82|5.0|To say that Dark Side of the Moon is a masterpiece is an unbelievable understatement.  There is a good reason this album has sold so many copies (and still continues to pop up on the record charts from time to time despite the fact that it was released 30 YEARS AGO).  From start to finish Dark Side is pure musical and lyrical genius.  Every sound on the album; whether its the heart beat to open and close the album, David Gilmour's incredible guitar work, or the screams of agony on &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;, has a greater purpose and they all work together to create a compelling, thought provoking look at madness and the parts of everyday life that can lead one down that path.  The lyrics are intellegent, poetic, and emotional and blend perfectly with the music.  There is simply no album that, from start to finish, can even compare to the brilliance of DSOTM.  This album is a must-have for all music fans.  If you don't own it already, buy 2 because if you have any taste at all, you will wear the first one out.

B00005R87Q|3.0|Sure, it's not going to win any writers immortal fame as brilliant storyline crafters, but, face it, The Fast and the Furious is a decent, nay, *good* movie.  It was exactly what it was billed as -  a movie about chicks, rice rockets and racing.  Whether any red-blooded male could dislike this movie is certainly a question in the first place.  The Fast and the Furious has some sweet chase / race scenes, nice cars and hot girls.  What male could say it sucked?  But, beyond that, it's a fairly decent movie.  Unlike many movies, ranging from the action genre, to the horror genre, to the infamous gross-out comic genre, have plots that resemble something thrown up after one too many bowls of Trix in the morning.  While it's not exceptional, The Fast and the Furious has a decent, vaguely palatable and even engrossing plot.  It's not offensive, at the very least, although the ending is quite lacking.  Paul Walker's acting is, admittedly, poor, but Vin Diesel is a very convincing and powerful character, and, in general, the array of supporting actors and actressess do their jobs quite nicely.  Overall, an enjoyable viewing.

B00004T37H|2.0|I'm sure some people will accuse me of being a purist.  OK, I can live with that.  BUT I don't think you have to be a purist to feel the way I do about this film.  This film may have been the biggest seller of all time in Japan, but the English language version wasn't, isn't and will never be.  Why?  Because even if the translation was perfect, which it wasn't, there are WAY to many concepts inherent in the story that cannot be understood without extensive knowledge of Japanese history.<br />Take the ending for example.  I'm sure I'm not the only person who felt like the ending fell a bit flat.  That's because, while I have studied Japanese history, I don't have the true FEELING of what it means to be a samurai, to follow the samurai way (bushido).  I don't truly comprehend the honor system, as most Japanese people do.  And while I do have some real experience with Japanese romantic relationships, I (and most westerners) don't share their belief in unrecoited, and even unspoken, love.<br />On top of that, I strongly disagree with the casting choices made for many of the voices.  Many of them were, in my opinion, simply monotonous, possibly because, I think, the voice actors were chosen because of the popularity of their names, rather than their actual abilities to do voice work, which is definitely different from acting in front of a camera.  (Don't get me wrong, I love Gillian Anderson on camera.)  And further on that subject, it just didn't fit to have have WESTERN American accents (and I am American) coming from traditional Japanese mouths, and it was even more inappropriate to have vastly different accents coming from characters living in one of the most homogeneous societies in the world.  Once again, casting for the sake of popular names.<br />NOBODY can fault Hayao Miyazaki for his work.  The animation was fantastic, the story epic, and the music perfect.  But after seeing (unfortunately proceeded by buying) this film, I MUCH prefer watching it in the original Japanese version, even though I can't follow the dialogue.  I'll keep it, but only because it helps complete my Miyazaki collection.

First of all, with only 7 tracks it runs over an hour. Next, the variety on this album, within each individual song, is amazing. It flows from one melody to the next smoothly and skillfully. The first time i heard the first song, I though I had heard 3 different songs. That impressed me. Also, I can't forget the remarkable nature of these songs. Listening to them makes you feel... well... profound.

Nicholas Sparks is an absolutely a delightful author, mixing the age- old story of 'rich boy meets poor girl' with the 1950's backdrop. It's wonderfully sweet.

B00005221L|5.0|I think this is a great action movie. Who can imagine the usual-looking secret mission would become  a deadly fight wiht a invincible-looking alien. I remember that I wondered about the opening scene (spaceship came to the Earth) when I was watching this movie for the first time. As well as terminator series, Die hard, this is the best of the genre. <BR>BTW, I had seen a scene in which our hero looked pale and almost shaking his hands out of fear of the Alien but I couldn't see this on the TV broadcast. Also, I heard that the Alien was played by J. C. Van Dame.  Is this correct?

People are still reading this book out of habit of picking up the latest Grisham, but it is nowhere as good a read as his previous books. The length is disappointing too for the price. The story is stale and the book certainly does not deserve to be on the best seller lists. This one is purely commercial folks! Coming right at Christmas Time too! Just a very average book that would have gone unnoticed had it been written by another less well known author.<br />If you love the original Grisham, Skipping Christmas then, is a book to skip altogether.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This album is a classic.  With some of Michael's best songs in it making it a wonderful buy.  Along with those amazing songs from the first-released Thriller, this special edition has interviews, and other songs.  Michael Jackson's original demo for 'Billie Jean' was even showed. Someone in The Dark made me cry and Carousel was beautiful.  <BR>Like many others, I believe this is an album MJ fans have GOT to get. :)
B00004U8JV|5.0|I think this movie was spectacular. Alot of technology was put into this movie. The dinosuars really looked real, and seemed to come off the screen at you. Once you look at this DVD you will never go back to VHS.
B00003CXFG|3.0|This film may not expand the Science Fiction Cinematic Universe as we know it, but there's a couple of twists and turns and enough atmosphere to make it a worthwhile addition to the genre.  \\"Pitch Black,\\" directed by David N. Twohy, involves a commercial space flight carrying forty passengers that crash lands on an unknown desert planet.  With three suns above them, there is plenty of daylight in which the survivors can negotiate their quest for survival, and finding water is their main concern.  As they begin to explore the wastelands for sustenance, they find evidence that others have been there, apparently some years before them:  A small ship and a couple of buildings; all of which appears to have been abruptly left behind.  Lead by pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), the small band of survivors have a couple of additional obstacles in their way, as well.  One is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer who was being transported to a penal colony.  But he may not be their greatest danger; because there is someone-- or something-- else close by.  Very close.  An entity that in all probability is responsible for the disappearance of those who came before.  And, if that isn't enough, Fry ascertains that the three suns above them will be setting soon; their world is about to be plunged into absolute darkness.  Soon, they will have to deal with Riddick and the entity stalking them in the pitch black of an eternal night.<br /> This concept is nothing new, and there's a sense of been there, done that, about it, but to Twohy's credit, what it lacks in originality he makes up for in presentation by building the suspense and maintaining the tension right up to the end.  The story was obviously influenced by a number of other films, predominately \\"Alien,\\" \\"Soldier\\" and even \\"Rocketship X-M\\" from 1950, but there is a unique characteristic about Riddick and a revelation at the end (that has to do with his true nature) that secures a separate entry in the annals of Sci-Fi lore for this film.  This one definitely has it's moments, enough to take it to a level that even such highly touted offerings as \\"Event Horizon\\" and \\"Alien 3\\" failed to achieve.  <br /> The performances, too, are a cut above the usual for this kind of fare, and while no one in the cast is likely to win an award for their work here, they do a good job, individually and collectively.  Radha Mitchell has an affecting screen presence and creates a very real person in Fry, equal to, if not surpassing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in \\"Alien.\\"  Diesel is effective, as well, especially in the menace he brings to Riddick, which is subtly honest and believable; the understated way he plays it gives added impact to the character and takes him beyond stereotype (though not quite up to Rutger Hauer's Roy in \\"Blade Runner\\").  With Riddick, what you see is basically what you get; there's not a lot of depth or complexity to him, but that's who this guy is, and Diesel plays it well.<br /> Also turning in effective performances are Keith David as Imam, Lewis Fitz-Gerald as Paris Ogilvie, Rhiana Griffith as Jack and Claudia Black as Shazza.  As Johns, Cole Hauser is adequate, but he fails to give his character the definition his co-stars achieved with their respective roles.<br /> Rounding out the cast are John Moore (Zeke), Simon Burke (Greg), Les Chantery (Suleiman), Sam Sari (Hassan) and Firass Dirani (Ali).  From the beginning, you know what you're in for with this one-- it's a survival story, and few of the characters, if any, are going to make it to the end.  But as entertainment, \\"Pitch Black\\" does the job; it's thrilling enough that by the time it's over you feel like you got your five bucks worth.  You may not remember it next month, but while you're watching, it's a pretty good rush.  It's the magic of the movies.
B00004U8JU|5.0|I thought this movie was spectacular. So much technology was put into this movie as well. Check out Jurassic Park the Lost World, and Jurassic Park III.
B00005NGSD|5.0|I can't really say if Taken By Force or Lovedrive is my favorite Scorpions disc, so, just make sure you own them both. While Matthias Jabs is a good guitarist he couldn't hold a candle to Ulrich Jon Roth. This would be Roth's last studio effort with Scorpions before departing for a solo career. I don't want to say he is as good as Hendrix, but he plays in the same vane. His work is superb throughout this disc.<br />There is no shortage of great songs on this disc. From my favorites &quot;Steamrock Fever&quot;, &quot;Sails of Charon&quot;, &quot;He's a Woman&quot;, &quot;Born to Touch Your Feelings&quot; and &quot;Riot of Your Time&quot; to &quot;We'll Burn the Sky&quot; you'll be amazed at the quality of the music here. There are even 2 bonus songs on the CD; &quot;Suspender Love&quot; and a live version of &quot;Polar Nights&quot;. Ballads and hard rockers this disc has a little something for everyone. This is where I caught Scorpions fever in 1976 and now you can have it on CD! This is the hardest of all the Scorpions discs to find, so, grab it while it's available to complete your collection.
0800177975|5.0|Arnold Swarzenegger was fantastic in this movie. Alot of action.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I watched this movie after reading the novel. May be this is why I was a bit dissappointed. I would be a fool to compare a movie with the novel it is based on. But about Hannibal I would say this: I actually miss Hannibal himself in this movie. The book presents a mind place or memory place created inside Hannibal's head which is completely omitted in this movie. The makeup of Mason disappointed me. The description in the book moved me more and really the gShock comes with the recognition that this is a human face with a mind behind it.h This is not the case in this movie. Anthony Hopkins is my favorite actor and I wonder if anyone could play the Hannibal role better. Julian Moore was okay. But I think the silence of the lambs was far better in every aspect and the present movie cannot stand for a sequel to that.
0805062971|5.0|Usually great books are either turned into mediocre films or else great films are made from mediocre books (and we won't even get into the sordid details of the novelizations).  Fight Club is one of the rare instances where a great film was made from a great book.  It is perhaps unfair to mention the film version while discussing the book as they are actually two very different animals.  (And animal is the right word -- perhaps uniquely amongst contemporary novelists, Chuck Palahniuk writes novels that seem to live in the reader's hands, often threatening at any minute to lunge for the throat.)  While most of the film's incidents are in the book and much of the razor-sharp dialouge is reproduced directly from the page, the book actually has a far greater satiric edge than the film.  Whereas the film used the story as a celebration of nihilism, the book is far too self-aware to allow itself to truly celebrate anything.  As such, it becomes less a call to action and more a devastatingly real portrait of a society that has become so commercialized and codified that even the once primal act of revolution becomes just another submission to pop culture.<br />Fight Club is the story of an unnamed narrator, an insomniac yuppie who spends his days helping insurance companies get out of having to pay their claims.  He wanders through a meaningless life until he discovers the emotional release of attending therapy groups for people suffering from various deadly (and rather embarressing) diseases -- all of which the narrator pretends to have.  When the arrival of another \\"faker\\" (the wonderfully dark Marla Singer, whose role is far less central in the book than in the film), the narrator finds even the shallow comfort of testicular cancer self-help groups has been taken away from him.  Luckily for him, he happens to meet Tyler Durden around this time.  And it is Tyler who introduces him to the concept of fighting.  What starts as a few rounds in a bar parking lot soon transforms into the nationwide movement known as Fight Club.  Every night, yuppies gather together and proceed to beat each other up and get in touch with the pure destructive instinct that society has forced them to suppress.  From this violent but relatively benign concept, Tyler sets out to build up an even more extreme movement and our narrator finds his own life suddenly spiraling out of control.  To go into any greater details would be unfair to those who have seen neither the film nor the book.  All that need be said is that the story never goes where you expect it too and the final twists -- while seeming a bit outlandish at first -- ultimately make a great deal of somewhat sickening sense. As complex as the plot eventually becomes, Palahnuik handles it all with a sparse, deceptively calm style that makes this book the literal epitome of a \\"page turner\\" -- once you start reading, you are hooked and it is truly impossible to exit the hauntingly and humorously dark world he's created until you reach the end.  Palahnuik proves himself to be an admirably subtle humorist and perhaps the funniest parts of the book comes from the reader's sudden realization that Fight Club has eventually become not so much a group of guerilla freedom fighters in the culture wars but instead simply a twisted mirror image of the weepy self-help groups that it seems to stand against.  While the film's final twist remains the same in the book, the end results are far more different.  While I personally favor the film's ending, both book and film build up to a strong conclusion that will stick with the reader long after completion.  Both the film and the book are truly original works of American Art and to see or read one without the other is to miss out on two exhilirating, similar but ultimately quite different experiences.
B000021XS0|5.0|the first time ive heard of these guys was about 2 years ago. I picked this album up because it was recomended by a friend. i had no idea how amazing this was because ive picked up crappy albums recommended by a friend before. i popped it in my cd and played it. just the mere concept of this album being pretty much 78 minutes straight thru was astounding, but the actual content was even more incredible. from start to finish it weaves together an intricuit story about a man (nicolas) plagued about a girl (victoria) that keeps reappearing in his dreams and her misterious murder.  some of the most amazing musicianship and talent you will ever hear on this planet.  the techical prowess of guitar master john petrucci, the highly, HIGHLY underated skill of bassist john myung, the incredibly creative pounding of drummer mike portnoy, the sheer talent of jordan ruddess on keyboards i mean he went to juliard at 9 YEARS OLD!!! and the impressive range of vocalist james labrie.  this album easily compares to such masterpieces as pink floyds dark side of the moon, queensryches operation:mindcrime and radiohead OK computer.<BR>i will never get tired of this album. it is a must have for ANY music lover. It is flawless (besides a misplaced bassdrum beat by mike portnoy, but im a drummer and picked that up) if u get this album, the only part u will regret about it, is all the time it takes up in ur life listening to it over, and over again. <br />P.S. they're latest effore Six degrees of inner turbulence is just as amazing as this one! dont forget to pick that up 2

1884822312|5.0|CHESS training in 5333 + 1 positions.  By [Laszlo] Polgar.  1104 pages.  Koln: Konemann Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 1994.  ISBN 3-89508-094-2 (hbk).  Reissued by Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers as 'Chess : 5334 Problems, Combinations, and Games', with a new Introduction by Bruce Pandolfini. ISBN: 1884822312 (hbk).<br />Laszlo Polgar (1946- ), Hungarian Olympic champion, master coach, and father and trainer of  the famous Polgar sisters, has here given us a training book to beat them all, one intended for beginners and amateurs from the basic level to master candidate (2,200 Elo).  Since it includes the basic rules of chess and explains, with the help of large diagrams, how each piece moves, and since the foreword and all explanatory matter have been given in no less than ten languages - English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, and Japanese - it will appeal to chess lovers of almost any age, level, or nationality.<br />Basically the book consists of over 5000 problems, many taken from over-the-board play, and most of which can be solved within a few minutes - though if you're anything like me some will probably take you much longer!   Polgar explains that there are \\"very few books containing chess problems, games and endgames which are not only easy to solve but elegant and instructive as well.  And there are even fewer that offer a sufficient number for regular and intensive training over a relatively long period.\\"  His aim is to help us develop our tactics and powers of pattern recognition, and his book, which is great fun to work through and involves practically no reading at all, certainly does seem to improve one's ability to see the possibilities a position may hold.<br />After a brief Foreword, and a 'Key to symbols' which explains, simply and concisely and in a way that even a small child could understand, the basics of the game, how the pieces move, capture, and mate, and the algebraic notation used throughout the book, the diagrammed positions follow -  Mate in one (1-306); Mate in two (307-3718); Mate in three (3719-4462); 600 miniature games (4463-5062); Simple endgames (5063-5206); Polgar sisters tournament-game combinations (5207-5333+1).  The book concludes with the Solutions (which give the first move of the Mate in two problems, and complete solutions of all other problems), a Biography of Polgar, and a Bibliography.<br />The original edition of Polgar's huge book is without doubt one of the most useful and certainly the most impressive and sumptuously produced chess book I have ever seen.  The book is of full quarto size (9 inches wide x 12 tall); beautifully printed on high-quality paper with each page holding just six (or later four) large and wonderfully clear diagrams; its spine stitched for durability; bound in thick boards with full cloth; and with gilt-embossed spine and front cover.  In contrast to so many of the 'books' that are being inflicted on us today -  trashy (though far from inexpensive) products on cheap and nasty paper with glued spines that will not open flat and which seem designed to self-destruct after a few hours handling - Polgar's is a magnificent piece of book production that will hold up for a lifetime, a rare treasure that belongs in the collection of all chess enthusiasts.  <br />So if anyone out there has a bright kid they would like to be the next Bobby Fischer - or if you yourself would like to be the next Bobby Fischer! - don't pass this one up.  It's a chess library in itself, and we don't often discover something that is not only so useful and beautiful, but is also an incredible bargain to boot.  Keep it open on the coffee-table.  Study a few pages a day.  And feel your chess muscles grow!
B000001DTM|5.0|Once you hear the first riff of Edge's guitar on &quot;Zoo Station,&quot; you know you are in for something special.  The music is top notch and so different from anything else, and the songwriting is U2's best.  &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was well worth the wait.  The time and effort spent putting this album together is evident.  The mix of raw rock and smooth ballads is a compliment to U2's far reaching abilities.  Even the little known songs are wonderfully executed.  The last song &quot;Love is Blindness&quot; has an amazingly, haunting guitar solo to finish off the album.  &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is not only by far U2's best album, but I'd put it in the top 20 of all time as well.
B00005RHGK|4.0|With very low expectations I rented this film recently, and was pleasantly surprised by its maturity and suspense.  Granted, 'Jeepers Creepers' shouldn't be considered a 'classic'- but its genuine inspirations come from wonderfully subversive and eclectic sources, such as &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, &quot;Duel&quot; and &quot;The Hitcher&quot;.  Effective camerawork, scoring, editing and pacing escalate this thriller above the usual garbage- and it was so refreshing to see a film NOT rely on sanitary CGI effects for its shocks.  <br />Overall a good Saturday matinee film, the kind of which we haven't seen since the early 80s.
1895565669|5.0|I love reading this book to my son.  It's our special song before he  goes to sleep at night. I sing it to the refrain of \\"Away In A Manger\\" just in case anyone needs a melody for it!
B00005LB9O|4.0|Okay... so I'm not sure what made me buy the Travis album.  They aren't getting any airplay in the San Francisco bay area... Coldplay is though and I really like their Trouble single.  ... I saw they were bundeling the two groups [Coldplay, and Travis] togethor.  I decided to buy the Coldplay album and two Travis albums (The Man Who, and Invisible Band).  Well, I was pleasently surprised because I actually like the Travis album more than Coldplay's Parachute.<br />Highlights for the album are \\"Sing,\\" \\"Side,\\" \\"Pipe Dreams,\\" and many other songs.  Sing's use of a banjo is really... (I can't believe I'm saying this) \\"COOL!\\"
B00005JKQX|5.0|A beautiful Mind was one of the best movies I have seen in my life. Russell Crowe, and Jennifer Connalie were fantastic.The movie was intense at some parts, but where at others it was casual.I would strongly recomend this movie to everyone. It was GREAT!

B00003CXCS|5.0|If I could give this 6 stars, I would.  Bear in mind, I'm an adult, pretty cynical, and a native New Yorker.  However, if there's one movie that can bring me to happy nostalgic tears, it's this one.  In minutes my cynicism is reduced to a grown adult bouncing around on the couch, singing along word for word.  It's the film that is most remniscent of my childhood, and I couldn't imagine growing up without it.  If you're a parent, or if you just want some happy, untainted idealism in your life, watch this movie.  It's still my favorite of all time.
0783240236|5.0|&quot;The Birds&quot; is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie for a number of reasons. Of all the Hitchcock films, this one has the most humor and the most suspense and scares. The acting is very good throughout and I really cared about what happened to the characters. There are scenes that have stayed with me after I saw the movie, including the attic attack near the end. Like all the best horror/suspense films, this one gives no explanation as to why birds are attacking, which makes it more terrifying. The DVD of this film has one of my favorite documentaries about the making of the film, with cast and crew interviews, storyboards, and matte paintings. The anamorphic widescreen picture looks good, and the sound is nice. Overall, this DVD comes highly recommended for the Hitchcock fans.
B00005B5L4|5.0|When I first heard Rumours, it was the original LP recording. Thought the record was in near perfect condtion, the sound was still not as superior as this DVD-Audio. I immedieatly went and bought the CD, and have played that a million + 1 times. In June, I stubled upon this in the DVD section of a music store. I bit the bullet and paid the price, and was amazed. As soon as I listened to it, my heart rose out of my chest. The sounds that were missing from the stereo versions of Rumours were back and blasting out of the surround speakers. I was taken away to space, where the music played all around me, and thrilled me. I was in heaven. I listen to this at least once a week, and each time I find even more hidden backround sounds that all add up to this ..... Rumours is THE BEST album ever recorded. The DVD-Audio really cleaned up the quality, and has made this sound better than most albums released today. I recommend this to any true fan of music, for both it's excellent acoustics and astounding vocals and song-writing. I give it 6 out of 5, and urge you strongly to buy it. If you are even considering buying this album, DO IT! You will not be disapointed.
B0000021RD|2.0|With the excepetion of PRELUDE, A.M MOURNING P.M MOURNING, and 2ND MOVEMENT which are lovely, short instrumental songs, I can only say negative comments about this CD! It...! What is particularly dissapointing and maybe why I am reacting so strongly towards a band that for the most part I like comes after hearing CHICAGO AT CARNEGIE HALL which has much better versions of songs that are on this CD. I was crushed to hear FANCY COLOURS ruined by the obnoxious ending on the studio version, and worse, to hear WHERE DO WE GO FROM HEAR sung in a sappy way, ruining the sweet, simplier live version. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and order LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL- a superior CD I can't say enough about. In fact, here is my review below:  <BR>REVIEW LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL: <BR>Shame on the reviewers who were so critical of this CD! I do realize that this has technical flaws (making me give it four and one-half stars for that reason), HOWEVER, it still rocks! There are some songs included that I personally don't care for, but it is still interesting to hear so many great early songs from the original members and L-O-N-G jams such as on SOUTH CALIFORNIA PURPLES and SING A MEAN TUNE KID. It gives a refreshing picture on a group that eventually turned into a \\"loung act\\" playing alongside Neil Diamond. When this was recorded the group was creative with a hard-rock edge. Hearing this for me has been like reliving the first few times I heard the Beatles' \\"WHITE ALBUM\\" because I knew some of the songs but was introduced to many great songs in a big bunch. Favorites to me are FANCY COLORS and HAPPY CAUSE I'M GOING HOME because of the strong positive emotions produced with the pretty melodies. Maybe the live Japan CD is superior (I haven't heard it) and I was dissapointed in BEGINNINGS for abruptly ending without any attempt to reproduce the wonderful single version, but wow, how can you guys be so critical of such a fantastic live album. The energy is high and the music soars! It is worth twenty bucks and then some! I only wish I could have seen this lineup instead of the sad \\"tribute band\\" playing in Las Vegas hotels now. Look to the past with this group and hopefully you will see why I feel so strongly about this CD!
B00005RYP7|3.0|My three-star rating is, I think, a tad generous, but it seemed more fair than two, because this movie does have some real suspense. It seems that every young actress that starts out innocent these days must soon get corrupted (or fade into oblivion). Wasn't Leelee Sobieski so lovably sweet and innocent in DEEP IMPACT? Then her innocence acquired a put-upon edge in NEVER BEEN KISSED. Still good and likeable. But after that came the seemingly obligatory squandering of innocence. For Leelee that lurid rite of passage was exceptioally harsh and gratuitous, in a bit part disjunct from the rest of the movie in EYES WIDE SHUT. Ever since then her characters seem to have an inexorable element of sniveling brat, too potent to be completely eclipsed by heavy plot elements making her a put-upon character, whether playing a terminally ill girl in HERE ON EARTH or playing a victim of a plot most sinister in the present movie. The movie title is a double entendre; Glass is both a prominent material in the title house's construction and the name of it's residents. Mr. Glass is played by Stellan Skarsgrd, who, if not in danger of becoming typecast already, certainly is after this movie. He's a relative of Leelee's character, Ruby, and becoms her guardian after her parents die in a car crash. At first at least, Mr Glass seems a put-upon character. Early on we see him being beaten up by obviously unsavory characters, loan sharks as it turns out. How then do we want to see the movie develop from this point? Well, for me, not exactly as it in fact does develop. There may be overkill in some characterizations. And what looks like the developing plot tensions may end up so eclipsed and overwhelmed as to be forgotten. That's not exactly what I wanted. A little bit more of things being what they seemed in the right places would have made it more to my liking. But if your tastes are somewhat different and those objections matter little or none to you, you might find this a quite satisfying thriller as it builds up to a taut climax.
0792151712|2.0|The first half is standard chick-flick tripe. The second half is alright with the boat sinking, but would have been better if you didnt already know it was going to happen!!!(a fictional story, and not the story of the Titanic would have made it much better) The 2nd star is for the sinking and DiCrapio dying at the end.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I thought this movie was spectacular. Ridley Scott did a great job with the film location and the directing. Anthony Hopkins, yet again, did a great job as the bone-chilling Dr. Hannibal Lector. I also believe Julianne Moore did a good job acting out Clarice Starling. The Italy scenes were wonderful and Mason's home was beautiful. The movie had some spots that were gory but what can you do, it helped in understanding those parts. So if you dont want to make Hannibal mad, go buy this movie which has a great dvd. The dvd includes just about 15 deleted scenes, multi-angle views of how they shot certain scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and much much more. It's the best two-disc dvd this year(2001)!
B00003CX5P|2.0|I was a little kid when the first trilogy was released. I always liked those movies. This one I didnt. I tried to. I did. It just wasnt there for me. Maybe it was the way Anikin was played by that Lloyd kid, or the WAY OVERDONE special effects, or the lame jokes and even lamer Jar Jar.(Lucas, what the hell were you thinking with him?) Some characters in movies have been annoying, but NOTHING like that waste of space!! Yousa [bad]Jar Jar!!! Even the saber fight wasnt special. Sure it was fun to watch, but there was no drama to it. They didnt even know who DM was!! I hope part 2 is more interesting with an older Anikin.
0446604844|1.0|My wife pushed me to read this, but this is probably the worse book I've ever read.  Except for the detail (ie, a secretary explaining back-up tapes to Sidney), the plot and characters are much better suited for a comic book, rather than a novel.  <br />There is no character development, no theme, and no plot development.  There are no hints as to why the character act the way they do.  I didn't even like the characters, even the \\"good\\" ones I was supposed to like.<br />Balducci and his agent wrote the book with story boards for the next movie in mind.  That would explain why they thought  it would be a great idea for an FBI agent to oggle a greiving widow immediately before her husband's funeral.  And all the references to Sidney's \\"sexiness\\"...<br />Bottom line: ...bad writing.
0525946284|3.0|At the beginning, I was pulled into the story of women operating from behind enemy lines during WWII. The action was brisk, the plot was driven by interesting characters, and I was looking forward to finding how it all played out.<br />However, something got lost in the middle of this story and I found it hard to finish.<br />I think the author missed a golden opportunity to tell the JACKDAWS' story.  Maybe the real truth was better than a 'fictionalized' re-telling of their story.<br />Oh, well.
B00005O5CM|3.0|It occasionally zigged when it could have zagged, but I admire Witherspoons portrayal of the main character.  Just 'cause she's into fashion doesn't mean she's dumb.<br />The extras on the DVD should have been left on the cutting room floor.

6305013578|1.0|This dvd is almost unwatchable. The film is actually printed so that a significant portion of the sides of the film runs off the edge of the dvd format. The image quality is poor and the music is unappealing. Get the Georgio Morodo version if you can, all things considered it is by far the best print available.
B000006FH5|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater as a child.  All my life I thought I imagined that the little girl on the train (when young Clark was speeding past it) was Lois Lane.  Any time I ever watched it whether it was on video or TV they never showed that it was her.  Finally, I was watching the movie on Encore and what do you know....they showed a scene with the little girl talking to her parents in the train about what she saw and they hushed her and called her Lois Lane.  I knew I wasn't imagining it!  I hate it when they cut things out for whatever reason.  How tormenting it was for a child who loved movies.  And still does.
0571212689|5.0|This is the book I was planning on creating but Richard Williams beat me to the punch. I am a pro animator and animation instructor (teaching At The Center For Character Animation in Levittown, NY) and I highly recommend this book; a wonderful informative bible of animation information from one of the very best in the business. I have made this A mandatory book for all our students. <BR>Basically, there are thousands of dollars worth of information crammed into this under 300+ page book. To the point, clear and concise, this gem is terrific for Cartoon animators and a definite necessity for computer animators.  Mr. Williams book is The MUST HAVE out of all the other animation books on the marketplace. Read it from cover to cover, then read it again and again.  A+++++++
0385505833|3.0|Its important when you read this to know what you're getting into. This book doesn't try to be profound, so if you're looking for a Charlie Brown-like treatise on the commercialism of Christmas, don't bother. And there is no murder, no lawyers, or runaway juries. Its just fun. I read it in one sitting and although I must confess to some annoyance at the ending (no trick ending--I swear!) it was very okay. It was nice to see a more humorous side to Grisham!
0446608955|5.0|This book was wonderful! It was so sad at the end I cried. It was so tuching. A very good romance novel. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00005TT77|2.0|I like this CD only because it reminds me of how excellent the originals are. Otherwise, it's nothing but middle-of-the-road alternative artists (with the exception of Eddie Vedder) wandering through this pointless waste of time and money. These \\"tributes\\" range from mildly irritating to simply nauseating. If you don't believe me, all you have to do is listen to both versions of each song. Then I'm sure you'll understand... And, to me, Nick Cave covering \\"Let It Be\\" is like hearing Fidel Castro singing the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\".
0805047905|5.0|This great book from Eric Carle is great for toddlers. I have a 2 year old son who received this book for his 2nd birthday. He is almost 3 years old and he knows this story so well he recognized the colors from the animals. Whenever I ask him about the colors he will tell me the color and the animal from the story. His imagination has expanded from reading this book. I recommened this book to parents who are beginning to read to their child. This is a great first start in reading.

0399226907|5.0|If you are beginning to read to your toddler child than this book is a great book to start. My 2 year old son loves counting the food that the caterpillar eats in this story. Your child learns how to count and recognizes what foods the caterpillar is eating. This is a great book. Start with a simple book like this.
0899668151|5.0|Bell Jar underscores the fact that some of us, regardless of intellectual, financial, or social status, simply cannot find our own link to life. This inner inability to connect with the world manifests itself as disenchantment. It may ultimately result in depression, addiction and untimely death, self-induced or otherwise. Although categorized as fiction, this book provides excellent insight into a recurring problem in our society.
0515125024|3.0|My first Lee Child book. Jack Reacher is a great character and the bad guys are nicely drawn. The first part of the book was a very good read. But then Child gets bogged down. No one just shoots a gun in this book -- Child has to describe the inner workings of the gun and then what gravity and the earth's shape do to the trajectory. Where child can you use one sentence, he writes a paragraph. Where on paragraph will do he writes a page.<BR>As others have said the same language used over and over is bothersome.<BR>This book needed a good edit. It could have been 40 pages shorter and a much better read. It's too bad because Child is a good storyteller.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When this movie came out it was marketed to the wrong crowd.  I watched it begrudgingly (I'm not too hip on Nicole Kidman).  I bought it immediately. I wish I had seen it in the theater.<br />Of course it's the old story of boy meets girl, but there are no original plot lines.  The miracle of this movie is in the music and visuals! The humor walks a thin line bewtween art the absurd but never crosses it. It is genius in its music mixes and editing style.  Nicole is good not great, but Ewen will break your heart.  Watch this movie at night in the dark with no distractions. You may love it or you may hate it, but it will have an impact nonetheless!
B000002L9Y|3.0|\\"Tango In the Night\\" was Fleetwood Mac's most commercially successful album of the 1980's, but when listening to it today the music seems dated and a little out of touch. Still, the three singers bring their own unique style and chemistry to this album and it works in varying degrees. The strongest material belongs to Lindsey Buckingham, who left the band shortly after Tango's release. \\"Caroline\\" and \\"Tango in the Night\\" are very effective and \\"Is'nt it Midnight,\\" which he cowrote with Christine McVie is perhaps the best song on the album. McVie had the most hits off this CD but her songs seem superficial and mannered. Stevie Nicks has always been the big draw of the band but her contributions on this CD are weak. Nicks' friend Sandy Stewart wrote the hit \\"Seven Wonders\\" and Nicks recycled her far-superior 1981 song \\"Blue Lamp\\" for \\"Welcome to the Room Sara.\\" The resulting track is curious and listenable but nothing memorable. The weakest track is Nicks' \\"When I See You Again.\\" McVie and Buckingham reportedly tried to block the inclusion of this song because of the lyrical content - or lack thereof. Nicks croaks and wheedles \\"what's the matter baby\\" some thirty times in less than 3 minutes before ending the song touchingly but not soon enough. This song, like the album as a whole, reminds us that the band's best days were past.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I am a car fanatic to start with, and have dreamed of owning a Toyota Supra Twin Turbo since I learned to drive in 1998.  It is still only a dream, but when I heard that this movie's feature car was a Supra I couldn't wait to see it.  I first saw the movie at the drive-in this past summer, it was awesome there, and I decided to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out.  I did just that, and you should too; as this movie might just be one of the coolest, fastest, and most addictive movies ever made.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I dont buy DVDs often, in fact, I think they are a complete waste of money. I mean, who wants to see the same movie over and over again? Snatch changed my ways. I completely enjoyed this film from start to finish. Much better then  \\"Lock, Stock\\". Characters were interesting and humorous, camera work was great, plot was twisting and engaging, all in all an enjoyable film worth buying on DVD.
0060278234|5.0|When I read Sabriel, the first book in this series, I was floored.  I had stumbled upon it in the \\"Young Adult\\" section and was pleasantly surprised that it is a fantasy novel of the highest caliber, equally suited to young teens and adults.  But I was even more amazed to hear that Nix was writing a sequel to Sabriel, which stood well on its own.<br />When I finally got a copy of Lirael I couldn't put it down.  I LOVED it.  After the success of Sabriel, Nix is free to explore a longer and more complex narrative, which will require two books to tell.  <br />Nix brings the character of Lirael and the world she inhabits to life so vividly that I almost wish the entire book centered upon her.  Unfortunately, Sameth, the other lead character suffers in comparison to the treatment Lirael gets in the narrative and is harder to sympathize with until almost the end of the book.  But in the end I was totally engaged and loving both of them.<br />I will be on the edge of my seat until the next book is released.
0767830555|4.0|I loved Taxi Driver . I think it is a classic. The only thing that has always bothered me about it was the ending. it would have made for a much better and grittier film if it ended with the last violent scene with Di Nero passing out and the camera panning from above. Instead it was &quot;hollywood-ized&quot; by showing that De Niro's character lives, sees Cyble Shepard and is proclaimed a hero. In my opinion, that last part ruins the whole film.
0345413377|5.0|First I'd like to say that this is my favorite book, and no matter how many times I read it, it never gets boring.  Harry Potter is a good series, but it's kind of \\"happy-go-lucky\\" where everything turns out well, and this book is focused more for young adults.  first you have to read the Golden Compass, and then the Subtle Knife, and i promise you that when you get to this book, you're in for a treat.  Pullman added a little romance to this book (which I thought was great) but I cry everytime I get to the end.  If you're 12+ I bet you'll enjoy it =)
0786880708|5.0|This has long been a best seller and justifiably so.  Kabat-Zinn works clinically with people who are stressed and his earlier book, Full Catastrophe Living, was written for people who are almost pathologically stressed, to bring them the beneficial effects of meditation.  The present book is written for average people on the street, who may not need so urgently the therapeutic effects of meditation, but in the belief that we can all of us use a healthy dose of it.  It is written with no religious strings attached, and even avoiding the word \\"spiritual,\\" and yet it has the ability to open up the spiritual realm for us, no matter what we wish to call it.  It is an introduction for the beginner and a source of good advice for the practitioner of meditation.  It's written in bite-sized chapters, in clear, easy and very readable prose.  It is a delight to read.  The book's three parts explore the why and how of meditation and its many applications in daily life.  Many chapters conclude with suggestions for reflection or meditation.  It is concentrated wisdom that deserves much rereading and a permanent place on your library shelf.
078062999X|1.0|Melodramatic, showy, ill-conceived, name-dropping, Shakespeare-losing, this film is a complete disappointment, especially as Branagh did so well with Much Ado about Nothing. Why would Jacobi allow himself to appear in it, except for much money?
B00003CWMI|5.0|Robin Williams, who, in his manic comedian days, entertained many, has developed into a fine actor who has brought the charachter to life.  <br />Perhaps success and life events have made him able to capture the essence of the subtle genisis of what it is to be human.  I treasure this video as one I watch when the world starts to get me down.
B00003CXFG|4.0|I recently rented this DVD from my local Blockbuster. I wasn't expecting it to be too good, but I still took it home and popped it in my DVD player. And that was when the amazment began.<br />The film begins with the Hunter Graztner (a spaceship) slowing moving towards a planet on a trade route. The ship design, I must say, is the best I've seen in years. The only thing it can compare to is the awesome Nostromo from Alien. But anyways you immediately hear the prisoner's (Riddick) voice (much better in DTS than Dolby 5.1). I think Vin Diesel hit his best acting in Pitch Black. He is just perfect for the role.<br />Riddick talks a while then hints at the future by saying things could go wrong. Immediately a meteor shower punches holes in the ship. The Captian, Dock Pilot, and Officer are awakened out of cyrogenic sleep. Unfortunatly the captian is dead from the shower, and this leaves the Dock Pilot to fly the ship.<br />The dock pilot, Fry, and her Officer Owen realize with warning as they get to the bridge that the ship is going into a planet's atmosphere. Once inside the free-fall to the ground begins. This is when the imigination of the writer really comes in. The ship is just plain awesome in its effects. <br />The ship crashes into a planet that is completly desert, surrounded by three suns. There are ten survivors, one of them the deadly prisoner Riddick. Riddick escapes and an expedition is sent to find water, and him. <br />The plot turns suddenly when a survivor is slaughtered by an unknown creature. Riddick is captured and blamed for the murder, but he swears it wasn't him. Finally the survivors discover that something else lives on the planet, something that sticks to the dark. Luckily there are three suns and the survivors have nothing to worry about. Until they discover a total eclipse that is scheduled to occur in a few days.<br />From then on the plot is pretty good. Some of the scenes are very good, like the fight between Riddick and Johns. But othersaren't so great- like when an Islamic youth is killed next to Riddick. The movie is so dark it is incredibly hard to understand what is going on.<br />All in all the movie is a great buy if you love sci-fi. The acting is very solid, the plot is worthy enough, and the special effects are good. Some places need to be tweaked just a bit (like some of the \\"Raptor\\" [alien monster Close-Captioned name] attacks). This is the best sci-fi horror movie I've seen since Alien (Alien: Resurrection was complete ...). So if you like sci-fi, buy it. If you aren't big into the science fiction world, I'd leave it alone.<br />-Robbie
B00005JG6Q|1.0|For this DVD edition, the producers decided to not only redub the film, but also rewrite the script.  So any dialog or plotline that is inferred by the original script is actually spelled out for you.  And thenew voices make it sound like a Disney movie.  I love this movie, but it is unwatchable with the revisions.  I hope to return it and find a copy with the old script.  So disappointing.  (as an added beef, why didn't they put both dubs on the same dvd?  there are few added features, so there is sure to be plenty of free space on the disc).
B00005NWM3|1.0|The only reason this song got so popular was because they wronte the most &quot;radio-friendly&quot; song in existance. They are completely unoriginal, and so boring I cant even stand to listen to a few songs off the album. I never bought it by the way, just heard it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It is good to see a modern day video throw back to the previous century. It reminds me of the days when Musicals reigned supreme. I found Moulin Rouge to be a very lively , amusing and touching film. Considering todays hip-hop market and mentality, Moulin Rouge is a tremendous spark for the heart. I feel it could be a good direction for future movie culture, if someone is willing to take the ball and run with it. Sit back and enjoy.
B00005K3O0|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 12 years old courtesy of late night TV. I watched it with my younger brother and we were both terrified. My brother and I saw it only once, but that single viewing was enough to provide us with a creepy story to share around the campfire for years - well, decades. I recently related the story to my nieces and nephews. Now they understand why Uncle Charles reacts so strongly when I casually mention &quot;Audrey Rose&quot; during &quot;scary story time&quot; at family get-togethers. This movie will haunt you (and me, and Uncle Charles) for years to come.
0780625129|5.0|Especially in light of the events of 9/11, this video is especially poignant.  I'm reminded of Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who established the Holocaust Museum who believed in \\"remembering evil to prevent it\\".  This video expresses a similar view; how to combat racism.  We are all just people in the same struggles in life.  Racism has never and will never make any sense whatsoever.  We are all just people, period.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It's important to remember what it is you're watching, as you're watching this.  It's a musical.  People don't break into song instead of conversing normally in real life, nor do they in realism theater.  This is not realism.  It's a musical.  A big, bold, graphic and glorious musical.<br />The performances are all incredible - each actor takes risks that may seem too much (but again, we're talking suspension of reality here) and your emotions will be on a wild rollar coaster from the first to the last note.<br />I saw the movie in the theater, and now own the DVD - which brings lots of entertaining extras that anyone who wants to see what goes into a musical will love.  Full length dance routines (not the shorter versions that make the final cut) and original camera angles make you take a second look at the movie - and realize just how brilliant Baz Luhrman is.<br />You'll be singing along before you know it - since you probably already know the songs anyway - and you'll look at your pop music favorites in a whole new way...<br />It really is Spectacular - Spectacular!!!

B000002H5I|5.0|Out of my huge CD collection this one always gets repeat spins. Every song is amazing and my jaw dropped when I first heard \\"Behind The Wall\\". My favorites are Mountains O Things, For My Lover (EVERYDAY I'M PSYCHOANALYZED! 4 MAH LOVA!!! THAT IS MY SONGGG!!) anyway, yeah I love the whole album. Baby Can I Hold You is my songgggg!!! I love this album!!!
B00005QZWJ|5.0|The soundtrack of the movie The Fellowship of the Ring is fantastic. \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" is a light, high-spirited piece that contains the essence of The Shire. Going on from there to \\"A Knife In The Dark\\" and \\"Many Meeings\\" we see a definite darkening of the theme. Listening to some of these pieces, one can almost see the text-and the scenes-flowing before your eyes. While Enya's \\"May It Be\\" at the end of the soundtrack doesn't really add to it, \\"The Breaking Of The Fellowship\\" is a beautiful, heartfelt piece that encompasses the sorrow at Boromir's death, the capture of Merry and Pippin-and the flight of Sam and Frodo. <BR>All in all, I definitely recommend getting this soundtrack.
B00003CXTF|3.0|What PEARL HARBOR strives to be is the \\"Titanic\\" it never was. Sure, it's a blockbuster, but the movie is far from getting a Best Picture Oscar nomination, except probably for the special effects and sound effects.<br />PEARL HARBOR is counting the days until and after the Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941, all the while spinning a somewhat uneven romantic triangle between Kate Beckinsale, Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck. Affleck and Harnett are top-notch pilots, while Beckinsale is an adorable nurse whom they both love.<br />PEARL HARBOR is a uneven movie that tries to be the \\"Titanic\\" of 2001, and turns out to be a pale imitation. Sure, it's not good, but it's far from being a expensive piece of eye candy. What we get from the movie is countless cameos from Cuba Gooding Jr. and dozens more; an uneven romantic subplot with the most awful romantic dialogue there is; a frightening, realistic 30 minutes as the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor; and a sad ending.<br />I prefer TITANIC over PEARL HARBOR because the story focuses more on the characters and events surrounding them, whilst PEARL HARBOR unevenly paces the many subplots it's sagging with, no tension as the battle rages on and off the battlefield, and all of the characters aren't fully fleshed out.<br />If you're looking for a good tear-jerker, this isn't your flick. If you're looking for mindless entertainment with terrific special effects and hokey dialogue, this is what you're looking for.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2s geatest album of the 1990s. This was the album that gave U2 a hole new image for thwe new decade. This album contains the amazing &quot;One&quot; single and &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;. It is a very good album and makes you feel good that it exists.
B00005U4UV|5.0|Herbert West (Jeffery Combs) is a mad scientist with an extreme messiah complex focused on cheating the gods of death. He has discovered a serum which when injects in the brain of the recently deceased makes the dead stand up and walk. Unfortunately, these are no longer our friends, relatives or loved ones, but rather adrenaline-driven super killing zombies. <br />Realizing Herbert's potential, his professor Dr. Hill (David Gile) has been keeping a close eye on his research. Hill is determined to do whatever it takes to get his hands on Herbert's discovery and steal credit for his work. While  forcefully trying to convince Herbert to turnover his findings,  Hill's head is viciously separated from his body. Herbert than decides that now is the time for the final test of his magical elixir and re-animates Hill's head and body. <br />Dr. Hill is still able to speak, even without a voice box and lungs and continues to be  psychically linked to his body, which he controls to wreak havoc and seek his revenge. There's a scene where Barbara Crampton is forced to have sex with Dr. Hill's head (only available in the unrated version). This all leads to a bizarre ending with plenty of zombies and gore galore. Followed up by the equally impressive sequel \\"Bride of the Re-Animator\\".
B000001FS3|5.0|wWithout a doubt the best U2 album ever. Then again it is probably the best album ever. A definate must for any music collection. even if you don't like U2 you must get this album!It includes songs like the fantastic &quot;Where the Streets Have no Name&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;.
B00005TT77|5.0|I am a big Beatles' fan.  I found having new cover versions is a refreshing change from the originals by the Beatles.  The original versions are still classic, but I enjoyed listening to songs I know, yet they seem new.  Much like George Martin's compilation/tribute album &quot;In My Life&quot; with various artists covering Beatles' songs.  So in other words, different is good.  I like the music on this CD.
B000001E18|4.0|Not the best album they havwe ever written, but once again U2 show that they can write amazing songs and give a great performance. Album contains &quot;Stay&quot; and &quot;Zooropa&quot;.
0812550757|5.0|A thrilling follow up to Ender's game. Once again, humanity meets an alien race and is forced to either understand the other or destroy it. Again, Ender Wiggin is thrust into the center of the conflict when, after a brutal murder, he is called upon in his role as speaker of the dead.<br />I really enjoyed this book. I could not put it down after the first paragraph. Not only was the plot fascinating, but the characters were believable. Flawed enough to be human but hopeful enough to be inspiring they really suck you into the story lending a credability that is lacking in many other science fiction stories. However, there is more to this book then a great story.  Like in Ender's game the author is exploring a facet of humanity through his work.<br />In Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card explored the confusing and often contradictory world of children. In Speaker for the Dead he explores a question no less deep: \\"What is faith really?\\" Unlike many of his fellow science fiction authors, he does not dismiss Christianity out of hand, but rather shows how the Church might have to deal with other life in the universe.<br />This book only confirmed the suspicion which began to form in my mind after reading Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card is a great writer. He can deal with heavy overarching issues without losing track of his story or characters. He made this book a great read, which I have no problem recomending to anyone.
B000001F3C|3.0|In my opinion this album is not U2s best. However it does contain some of the greatest songs ever written. &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and New Years Day&quot;.
B00005U18E|5.0|I could watch \\"Pride and Predjudice\\" over and over again. One of my top twenty, for sure. And now I have another favorite, \\"Bridget Jones's Diary,\\" to add to that list -- as watchable as the TV film series that partially inspired it.     Having Colin Firth as one of the leading men in both films is also a plus. Though we women often say we want a man who can communicate, why is it when the Colin Firth character (in both films) hesitates at the most important moments to say what's on his heart that we find it so romantically irresistable? I guess it's because in both films, the truth does eventually come out (something that doesn't always happen in real life).    If you've always wanted to be liked \\"just as you are\\" (my favorite line from the movie), this is the one for you...to watch over and over again.

0316548189|5.0|We sang, &quot;Free Nelson Mandela.&quot; We walked the streets of our own cities hoping for an end to apartheid and we weren't even sure what that meant.

0380973650|2.0|I know I am going to get railed with a 2 out of 133 or something for my unpopular opinon, but I think that Gaiman's novel was high on concept and potential but never took off.<br />I find all kinds of mythology interesting, and that is exactly what made me purchase this book and I think Gaiman did a good job of incorporating competeing mythologies into the novel.  However, and I know that this is not the most eloquent way to put it, but the book just didn't do it for me.  It really just felt like an airport book of the week, like Sidney Sheldon's \\"Doomsday Conspiracy\\" which took an interesting topic (at the time) and made an episode of All My Children out of it.<br />I think what it came down to for me was that I never beleived in any of the characters, especially Shadow, and I saw the twists coming from a mile away.  I hate saying that, but it is true, the story was transparent.<br />I am not an avid fantasy reader, though I dabble in Sci Fi, so take that into account with my review, but over all, I was just waiting for a bang that never came.
B00005TT77|3.0|Title speaks for itself. The aimee mann/michael penn duet is lovely. The sara mclachlan tune sounds &quot;treated&quot; but i have a soft spot for her voice (however enhanced). Rufus wainwright's contribution is pretty straightforward if his voice is anything but. As a matter of fact, the first eight tracks are nice ear candy, save for ben harper's take on strawberry fields. for my money, the ben folds song is the best of the lot. the rest ranges from uninspired to downright forgettable (heather nova's breathy cover of &quot;we can work it out&quot; has no clue where it is or what it wants to do) except for nick cave's treatment of &quot;let it be&quot;.
0451167716|5.0|I picked up this book from a friend's bookcase because I was bored. Having already seen the movie, I thought this would just pass away the time. It stole time, actually. I couldn't stop reading, becoming so engrossed in the plot, storytelling and characters despite already knowing the ending. <br />Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather\\" is truly a masterpiece. There is no flowery prose, no extra detail to make the scenes more attractive: this is story telling at its leanest and best. The characters are drawn beautifully, lovingly, honestly: so much so that you can steeped into the Corleone family and live through each character. <br />This book is testament of how much a piece of literature can entertain. While the movie was spectacular, it doesn't stray from the book (a miracle that Hollywood actually kept the story, almost exactly.) Still, the book is even better because there's more insight into each character.<br />Imagine my disappointment when, after finishing this book, I found out there isn't a Part II or Part III. Those were fabrications of Hollywood. I almost cried!
B0000035E7|5.0|I think Bleach is a great album, very different from virtually anything else I heard, and I don't only mean in Nirvana terms. it's about as unpretentious as you can get, with lyrics that range from depressing to hilariously silly.<BR>Here are the highlights for me, in order of, um, appearance:<BR>Blew- (kind of weak lyrically, but the great Nirvanaesque melody is already intact), About a Girl- (a classic. Very different from the Unplugged album version, but just as good), School- (this is pure fun energy), Love Buzz- (I love the instrumental parts here, they play this song really well), Paper Cuts- (one of the more serious songs with probably the best lyrics), Negative Creep- (see School), Scoff- (this is hilarious! And I love the melody), Swap Meet- (this is the song which had an effect on me first. That is to say, it was the one I remembered after the first hearing), Sifting- (I love the riff of this song. I just can't say enough good things about the riff), Big Cheese- (to this day I am not sure what it is about this song that I love so much).<BR>Bleach is the kind of album whose songs make a well-integrated whole, they all have something in common that binds them and that makes it hard to start listening to the album without continuing with no breaks till the very last song. I am not sure what it is about Bleach that I love so much. Yes, In Utero is a stronger album. But the songs on Bleach are something you just don't hear anymore, or at least something you certainly don't get to hear often. It's innovative and performed with absolute zeal. Kurt Cobain screams, roars, and rasps his heart out and just makes you enthusiastic and energetic, sometimes in a happy way, sometimes in an angry way.

6305014140|4.0|Where the stiff and boring \\"Demon City Shinjuku\\" failed, \\"Ninja Scroll\\" succeeds. A budding and fitting example of mature anime, \\"Ninja Scroll\\" is the kind of movie you should watch without too many expectations.<br />For the most part, \\"Ninja Scroll\\" manages to get many factors right. The animation is some of best I've ever seen in an anime movie, and the characters, while not perfect, are interesting and likeable. The story, thankfully, isn't another version of a \\"lonely warrior, along with a beautiful woman he's going to lay sometime in the movie, must save the world from a powerful evil before it's too late.\\" Instead, it plays out more like an \\"X-Files\\" episode, where the plot changes unexpectedly from time to time, although the plot twists won't surprise everyone. The amount of action is also satisfying, albeit extremely gory, and several of the evil characters are some of the coolest villians to appear in anime (although many of them are only seen for about five minutes).<br />But \\"Ninja Scroll\\" does fall short in a few areas. To up the mature rating, several sex scenes are scattered throughout the movie, all are gratuitious, and one in particular is completely unnecessary. Also, the plot, while not stereotypical, does have some pacing and execution problems, and the ending of the movie wasn't particularly satisfying, nor did it make any sense.<br />All in all, \\"Ninja Scroll\\" as a whole is a movie that is questionable but ultimately satisfying. It is a very mature work of anime, but probably not as mature as \\"Wicked City\\" and \\"Legend of the Overfiend\\". I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under 18 or to anyone who hates extreme violence or extreme sexual situations.
630575067X|2.0|George Lucas wrote and directed the very funny 'American Graffiti' and the very imaginative 'Star Wars'. So what happend, George. What happened to 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'??? The reason I bring this ancient movie (1999) up now is because Lucas' new film, 'Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' is arriving in theaters in May of this year. I have a feeling this next film will be better than the last. I hope to GOD it is for everyone's sake. It really IS a good series (all except for the last atrocity - I give it two stars for its special effects and Ewan McGregor). There was a rumor going around: some of the actors, especially star Liam Neeson, noticed that Lucas was more interested in the technical aspects of the film rather than the actors. No wonder the acting was so wooden. Neeson, Natalie Portman (most of the time) and the boy (the one who played 'Anakin Walker - the future 'Darth Vader' - give me a break) all came across as wooden heads, and the boy is especially bad. Sorry. Sorry. I shouldn't blame the boy. I blame Lucas for not working with this kid, and for allowing such brilliant actors as Neeson to stroll through the role like the lobotomized Jedi Knight he was. McGregor at least 'tried' to add something extra, but when you have a director (Lucas again) who cares absolutely nothing for the actor, the script, the story, etc., 'The Phantom Menace' is bound to become not only one of the worst movies in 1999, but one of the worst science fiction movies I have ever seen. I have read some reviews commenting on the red-faced Darth Maul. What a clown. He was one millionth what Darth Vader (James Earl Jones - remember him???) was. Maybe Lucas shouldn't direct these movies. Like in 'The Empire Strikes Back' (easily the best of the films) and 'Return of the Jedi', Lucas hired others. Maybe he has lost 'touch' with humanity. Maybe he himself, like his numbing creation 'Jar Jar Binks', has also turned into some kind of dull alien whose only interests lie in boring audiences with the latest in super-technology. I know at one time Steven Spielberg had expressed interest in directing one of them. Maybe Lucas should remain 'behind the scenes' (and I do mean WAY behind the scenes). The real talent is always in the writers (good writers, George), the actors, and the hundreds of craftsmen who put together such an eventful science fiction film. Sooooooo, 'Phantom Menace' was a real dud. Will I see the next film??? Even though I am not happy with the title 'Attack of the Clones'???. Another hour and they have come up with a MUCH better title, guarenteed. But remember this, Lucas doesn't care about titles or scripts or actors - afterall he is truly a cyborg with no emotions, something his fans didn't know I bet. Still, I look forward to watching the 'newer' Star Wars saga. It features actors like Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor (I loved him in 'Moulin Rouge' - you should see that if you haven't already), Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee (I LOVE Mr. Lee). I also heard that Hayden Christensen is a HUGE improvement over that 'kid' (I don't blame the kid - I blame the director). And the special effects should be masterful no doubt (afterall, Lucas OWNS ILM up north). 'Attack of the Clones' (WHAT a title), I can only wish upon a midnight star, will be a VAST improvement over the disappointing 'Phantom Menace' which took the series to an all-time low. Please, George Lucas, move to the planet Endor or at least wake up and smell the Wookies. A meaningful story, good writing, attention to the actors is what makes a film GREAT. The special effects can only enhance a film's quality, and we know Lucas is an expert at F/X. Well, I am crossing my fingers that May's 'Attack of the Clones' is indeed memorable and falls into line with 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Hey, one can only wish, can't they.
B000002A3T|4.0|This is another one of those CDs that I wanted but didnt want to pay full price for. So when I found it for discount I bought it.  I really like it and listen to it often. Many of the songs are well put together. I like nearly all the songs. Marooned is my favorite instramental ever and high hopes is in my top ten favorite pink floyd songs list. All of the songs are slow though and that's why I didnt give it 5 stars. Still I think that most people will like this.

B00005QZWI|5.0|A friend of mine recently said he was surprised John Williams (&quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;Superman,&quot; etc.) didn't compose the music for this movie. I had to disagree. While I'm as big a Williams fan as they come, I found Howard Shore's score the perfect match. The exciting parts were thunderous, the quiet parts were gentle -- there wasn't a single misstep in this composition.<br />As good as Williams is, I don't think his style would have treated the softer moments of this movie with the elegance Shore did -- in &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; there is a brief violin snippet that that still resonates in my mind a month after first seeing the movie. In fact, it was that snippet that made me decide to purchase the album.<br />In other words, it's perfect. Pick it up.
1573226521|5.0|Ready for some excitement and adventure?  Pick up The Beach and lose yourself on a tropical island...<br />Richard, a twentysomething backpacker who spends most of his time searching for bigger and better places to see, finds his way to Thailand for a little R&amp;R.  But something is definitely different about this trip and most of it comes in the form of his crazy hostel neighbor, Daffy, who talks incessantly and angrily about a beach.  Tucked away in a remote and off-limits part of Thailand, the beach Daffy speaks of is considered a utopia, a perfect world that is unspoiled by tourists, a prize at the end of a tiring quest.  Naturally Richard is curious, so he sets out with a French couple, Etienne and Francoise, and a map drawn by Daffy in search of this pristine fantasy land.<br />The island commune in The Beach would definitely pass for a secret Woodstock hideaway.  Richard's journey is like no other; a riveting and spectacular adventure.  Reading this book was the next best thing to swimming in their private lagoon, spearing fish and viewing the underwater corals.  Island politics and the obsessive desire to keep the island's secrecy plays a heavy role in this novel and is also a prime example of how, even in paradise, one can somehow manage to destroy it.<br /><br />Dark and sinister, as well as sarcastically funny, The Beach is a fast and furious novel that transports readers to another place in the blink of an eye.  Alex Garland's writing is razor-sharp and indicative of his amazing storytelling talent.  The movie cannot begin to touch the depth and fascination of this unforgettable novel.
0446677450|2.0|The title sucks one in - as the author himself indicates, that is by design.  He is a self-professed best-selling, and not best-writing, author.  This is evident.  The book is written at a junior-high level intellect and composition style that becomes increasingly annoying.  Thoughts and exact sentences are repeated frequently, and the result is a read much like the two-page advertisements you see in magazines geared toward get rich / lose weight etc. plans that implore you to send three payments of $19.95 to receive all of life's answers.  The quit-working-for-the-man-and-be-your-own-boss preachings are merely repackaged here, and the numeorus diagrams are rediculous wastes of space.<br />That said, there are a few interesting tidbits of useful knowledge buried therein, e.g. buy real-estate cheap and re-sell for a profit.  Set up a corporation to do so to minimize taxes.  Wow...thanks for the advice.  Such \\"lessons\\" could be better set forth in a bulleted article of several pages rather than this rambling work.<br />The author has made his point - good salesmanship results in sales (his book).  His rich dad (a friend's father) would say that we critics are missing out on the fly-by-the-pants philosophy that he advocates, and simply don't understand it (like his biological poor dad).  Perhaps that is the case.  Or perhaps it is merely a nice daydream for educated, hard-working, and succesful people who wonder during their two-week annual vacations what it would be like never to return...
B00003CXFG|3.0|I saw a trailer of this and it looked like a low budget shlock movie. I rented the DVD for various irrational reasons and it was a reasonable science fiction thriller. Despite looking low budget in the previews the sets and filming are quite good. <br />The main attractions are the two leads, a convict played by Vin Diesel and a female pilot played by someone else. <br />The film is interesting as it has a female in the jock lead role and in doing so it is not artificial like Tomb raider. The actress playing the role is both effective an charasmatic. <br />Vin Diesel is also a pleasant surprise. In interviews he comes across as a little dull but he is able to give a multi dimension peformance to his role. You have in a science fictin film something unusual a interesting and rounded character. <br />The photography is good, lots of washed out tones which create the sense of an alient world. The &quot;monsters&quot; provide menance by only being shown for short periods and the way they are portrayed does not degenerate into comedy as can sometimes happen. Quite a reasonable DVD to play to while away a few hours.

B0000024Z7|5.0|Carlos Santana's \\"apex\\", \\"apogee\\", call it what..., this recording for me was the HIGH WATER MARK as Santana recordings go.<br />Carlos had \\"prefected\\" his trademark sound, the anguished -cry interstellar blues note bending coupled with a more fluid approach to his previously bluesy street guitar sounds(this can be  attributed to his almost exclusive use of the dorian mode scales, along with the usual  pentatonic blues scales most other  \\"rockers\\" so heavily depend on.<br />It is common knowledge too , of Carlos' affinity for jazz and Brasilian forms.<br />He records Jobim's classic instrumental, \\"Stoneflower\\" on this recording, and named another lp/cd \\"Borboletta\\", the Portugues word for butterfly instead of using  the Spanish \\"Mariposa\\").<br />Santana's creativity in his improvised lines was at peak level, as displayed by endless choruses of creativity on the tune , \\"song of the Wind\\".

0345451325|4.0|Nylund's &quot;Halo: Fall of Reach&quot; could be directly compared to Robert A. Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; in terms of its ability to create a war setting, futuristic characters for that setting, and make a reader care deeply about the novel's outcome.  <br />&quot;The Fall of Reach&quot; is a story meant to be the prequel for the Xbox game Halo: Combat Evolved, and as such it completes its task to every extent.  The novel sets up the characters, gives gamers and readers alike a history of the future and its soldiers, and it never allows for a spare moment.  This is a novel that can easily be read in four or five hours, due to its tenacious speed and overwhelming levels of brief, yet thorough, details.  <br />While I did want to give this novel five stars, I am compelled it lower that rating to four stars because it relies too heavily upon secondary sources (the video game) for its details.  In other words, if you haven't played Halo: Combat Evolved, you are bound to misunderstand much of what the SPARTANS look like, what the Covenant look like, and what the machinery looks like.  Nylund seemed a bit too quick when he introduced these elements of the novel, and that leads me to believe &quot;Halo: Fall of Reach&quot; is meant to compliment the video game, instead of the game complimenting the novel.  <br />In the end, if you are looking for a compelling novel that alludes to how (unintentially) cruel a military can be, I highly recommend Fall of Reach.  Also, if you've played Halo, this is a must-read: the novel compliments the game so well that you'll return to the game's world just to re-experience the drama Nylund set forth.
B00005JY1B|3.0|Sweet November is one of those movies where cold hard reality doesn't really exist in it's ficticious little world. However, having said that, director Pat O'Connor does his best to create a little bohemian world that is inviting, mainly due to the charisma of the two main leads. <br />Nelson is an ad exec that exists in a world where they are forced to implant a phone to their brain, forgo their personal lives and become ratrace automatons. He meets Sara (in a way that only exists in movies), at the DMV. After getting her accidently kicked out, she starts intruding into his life by telling him about her \\"one month\\" boyfriend idea, where she takes a lover for one month and improves his life. Nelson, already thinking she is crazy is mortified and justifiable dumps her. Then he is dumped by his girlfriend, but that is just the beginning. <br />Eventually in a presentation to a hot dog company, that would never exist in real life (I could of done a better pitch job...Market Demographic Reports anyone?), he is canned and takes her up on the offer. She teaches him to respect life and take control of it. Of course, it is easy to do such things when you don't need a job to support yourself, which is too easily explained as Sara being a E-commerce guru. I don't need Sara to show me how to live life, I need to win the lottery.... <br />There are some plot twists that turn this story into a twisted Pretty Woman/Romeo&juliet story and it ends on a somber note. I won't go into this because I don't want to give away plot points (even though they were pretty easy to see a mile away). <br />Anyone who lives an existance which is composed of all work, having no friends, hobby or romantic life will find this movie appealing (like me). This is our fantasy, to find an attractive mate that will \\"be your slave\\", never work, visit beaches and eat good food; but it just will never happen, that's why I see this movie as more of a whimsical fantasy rather than a serious romance. There is nothing that works on the sensible side of my brain. If I came at it for what it is, I would say this is a non-sensical movie that stereotypes 1. Gay men 2. Corporate Executives 3. the Standard Protagonist among others. There are some very hokey points in the movie as well, one which involves very bad singing by Keanu and another which involves 12 lame presents including a dishwasher. Also, the whole setup of finding, serving and improving a person for one month is bizarre and would indicate that Sara needs some major psychological help. Luckily, I kept that part of my brain shut off for this movie. <br />However, I did like the ending, an ending which I wish \\"Pretty Women\\" had. Too often in these movies, the man changes and the woman falls into his arms, to live happily ever after. This doesn't happen and the way that O'connor ends it provides a much more powerful statement that anything julia roberts and richard gere did in their \\"fairytale romance\\". <br />Overall, this movie is not bad. While it is overly sentimental and unrealistic, it is lovely to look at (especially the charismatic leads) and does have moments of both serendipity and retrospect that make it worth watching...Rating: C+

0380788624|5.0|This is my new all time favorite book.  I read it a second time and loved it even more!  I was chortling with amusement practically every other page-- Stephenson's cynical, incisive editorial adds wonderful flavor.  The utilization of Lawrence Waterhouse, a brilliant but nearly idiot-savant-like mathematician, to characterize a story surrounding the role code-breaking played during World War II was inspired, and Stephenson portrays Waterhouse intricately and magnificently.  I found myself feeling like I was living behind Waterhouse's eyes while reading-- a wonderful way to keep what is obviously intended to be a particularly brilliant character more down to the level of the book's readers.  I loved this character!  I wanted more of this character and his interactions with Alan Turing.<br />Some nit-picky complaints: 1) the book was clearly the first of a series, and the end, while appropriate to the storyline, was a little anti-climactic given the superlative job done in the body of this work.  2) the math is far too rudimentary for mathematicians of the calibre of the characters, but I understand why this may have been done, 3) there is a little too much dwell-time on bodily fluids for my taste.<br />Nonetheless, I can't wait for the sequel!  Bravo!

B00005OAIE|4.0|We all go through those periods when we look at our entire CD collection and say \\"YUCK!\\". After that we say a silent prayer to the CD god to send us a new album to renew our faith in music. John Mayer's ROOM FOR SQUARES hits the spot! You'll be listening to his inner heart with every track. God bless this guy's parents. They did a wonderful job!<br />As a songwriter, John has a very unique perspective. I can only compare it to Dar Williams in that it's a hybrid or worldly wisdom and childlike innocence. It's as though he's experiencing everything he's writing about for the first time and he's thrilled with the new discoveries. The consistency is pretty solid too. Each track is well polished and beautifully worded. <br />His sound is that of shimmering pop, without the computers. His melodies are graceful and catchy as all get out. His voice has a similar timbre as Dave Matthews but (with all due respect) his falsetto is far better. There's a clarity in John's voice that I don't experience in Dave's either. The tones are both fun and reflective. Great album to clean your house to on a Saturday! <br />By buying this album you're basically purchasing the diary of a bright eyed boy looking at the world through newly acquired adult eyes. It's positively enchanting.

I'm glad there was a mix of races in this movie from Asain ,Blacks,Hispanic and,Italian.It gave the movie depth it made it seem more realistic. The only reason I gave it four stars was that the pacing threw me for a couple moments and I was tempted to fall asleep until the action started other wise it was a treat to see definently a buy when I can track it down on DVD.

There is another version, quite different and quite wonderful, which was released as the b-side to \\"Witch's Promise\\" and included on the 20 Years Of Jethro Tull box set.

0375704027|5.0|\\"Now... I realize that all I can place in the imperfect vessel of writing are imperfect memories of imperfect thoughts.\\"  This is how Haruki Murakami, through the voice of his noble narrator Toru Watanabe, begins \\"Norwegian Wood\\".  It is a poignant beginning; one that brings into question the factuality of all that follows, but not necessarily the feeling. <br />This is the second of Murakami's books that I've read.  The first, \\"A Wild Sheep's Chase\\" lost me in its allegorical approach to the existential detective novel.  \\"Norwegian Wood\\", while a much more straightforward and accessible a narrative, is no less complex.<br />Although written in Japanese, you'd never know it.  Jay Rubin's translation is seamless, capturing Murakami's easy dialogue effortlessly.  The writing really shines through.  As do Murakami's rhetorical techniques, which include using personal letters to get past what would be a lot of lengthy exposition.  Usually I find this technique distasteful and lazy, but Murakami's letters are so skillfully economical and honest (not to mention woven consistently into the narrative) that I found it to be a rather effective technique.  And his powers of language are staggering, so much so that he manages to make tired cliches seem robust.  He even trumps the saccharine 'box of chocolates' simile from \\"Forrest Gump\\", coming up with an analogy of his own that is not only clever, but also relevant and original.<br />It also helps that for Western audiences, Murakami is unexpectedly accessible, as American music and American literature dominate his thoughts.  This gives the novel (like all of Murakami's novels, from what I understand) an almost paradoxical feel for Western readers.  I found myself skipping along, feeling as if the story was set in Berkley during the late 1960's, but then every once and a while Japanese culture will jump up; after a touch of vertigo, you realize just how transcultural the East has become.<br />Another of the novel's major themes, and definitely its most powerful, is the notion, often repeated, \\"death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life.\\"  Watanabe appears to have the Midas touch; only when he comes in contact with people, they don't turn to gold, they die.  Sometimes it feels like Murakami is chronicling the genocide of a sensitive subculture of 1960's Japanese youths.  Fortunately, death is never exploited.  Well, sometimes it's used as a device to jumpstart the narrative, but Murakami has such sensitivity in his writing that it never feels cheap.<br />Murakami's greatest feat is his spare recounting of college dormitory life.  It's rendered realistically, providing a setting for much of Watanabe's ennui.  He even notes at one point that college is nothing more than a \\"period of training in techniques for dealing with boredom.\\"  Luckily, Watanabe gets a lot of mileage out of the people he meets in his dorm.  A fastidious roommate, a lecherous friend, and others provide a menagerie of minor characters who revolve around the story's periphery, reflecting back at Watanabe certain aspects of his personality that he may not want to see.<br />In Watanabe, Murakami has created a terrifically grounded narrator.  He is frank and plainspoken, to such an extreme degree that the people he knows keep commenting on it.  He lacks pretension and ego, while constantly in a mode of observing.  In many senses, he is a perfect narrator.  Thankfully he fulfills that duty, because as a character you'd almost never notice him.  He goes through periods where he's a cipher, and then through periods where his low-key charisma inexplicably attracts a number of beautiful, iconoclastic girls.  It appears that you have to be tuned to a specific, underground radio station to really appreciate Watanabe.  He's like a secret club that only attracts people who are \\"kinda weird and twisted and drowning\\".  I dug him.<br />The bulk of the novel is taken up with Watanabe's relationships with two of these weird and twisted characters.<br />Midori, a fellow student, is a whirlwind of unbridled curiosity and unchecked ego, especially when the topic is sex.  She's also funny, charismatic, sad, immature, dramatic, passionate, and highly emotional.  She challenges Watanabe, and is successful in bringing him out of his shell.  I found myself rooting for Midori to be the one that Watanabe chooses for love; but in the end Murakami makes you realize that love is not a voluntary thought, and that the \\"choice\\" is never that easy.<br />Instead, Watanabe is obsessed with Naoko, the girlfriend of his dead best friend.  Their love affair is always tenuous, and kind of creepy in its necrophilia.  Naoko is tortured and troubled and sad.  It's hard to decide if she never really loves Watanabe, or is just incapable of love.  Murakami never provides easy answers when dealing with her situation.  In that way she becomes not only the most real but also the most frustrating character in the book.  What does Watanabe see in her?  I'll never know, but I certainly recognize his reactions to a transcendent feeling.<br />Naoko also provides the book's title.  She loves the Beatles' song 'Norwegian Wood' because it \\"can make me feel so sad.  I don't know, I guess I imagine myself wandering in a deep wood.  I'm all alone and it's cold and dark, and nobody comes to save me.  That's why Reiko never plays it unless I request it.\\"  Reiko, Naoko's roommate, in a typical moment of wit, comments that it \\"Sounds like Casablanca!\\"  This is typical Murakami: positioning gentle emotional epiphanies against modern, pop-culture obsessed observations.  It's a style that certainly makes this book, on the surface morbid and forlorn, addictively readable.
B00005QW5X|3.0|I knew the subject matter before hand so it is not like I don't appreciate films about gay people. On the contrary, I consider myself a pretty open minded person and am always up for something different.  I didn't know that I would be witnessing one of the most BIZARRE films that I'd ever seen.<BR>I really wanted to see this because John Cameron Mitchell, Hedwig/Hansel, was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor.  He was critically acclaimed, and after all the bad movies with even worse acting that I had seen in 2001, this couldn't be much worse.<BR>Well, This is just not for everybody.  Especially straight men that have a bit of a phobia for watching movies to do with gay men.(especially when the sex/love scenes arrive).  My husband left the room.  I on the other hand, watched the entire film with some dismay.  I do think that John Cameron Mitchell was totally amazing and gave a very riveting performance as the main character.  He had this great confidence in his acting, and seemed to really enjoy playing this character, Hedwig.  <BR>I think that the direction and the pencil drawing animation is what I found bizarre, but not bad.  <BR>The ending was the most bizarre part of all as I just lost all understanding and meaning of the movie.  What is it that they are trying to say here? It isn't all cut and dry, maybe I missed something that others saw.  <BR>I think all the acting was very good, especially JCM.  He is very talented, and I imagine that the live show must be a real powerhouse of entertainment..for those that can appreciate this kind of show.  <BR>It's not that I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.  It totally depends on the individual.  It's certainly a movie I will never forget.  It has been 24 hours since I've watched it, and I still have got it up there in my head.  I really loved watching JCm...
B000056QD6|5.0|Hey,this album is so good! You can listen to many never-heard-songs! But I care about the difference between singl version of &quot;All alongthe watchtower&quot; and this album's one. The difference<BR> is almost nothing!
0553573403|5.0|Imagine, an eight hundred page fantasy epic with no quests, no elves, and no gnomes. This is a great opening to George R.R. Martin's six book series \\"A song of Ice and Fire\\". Although many of the characters of the book have a darkside, there is no evil lord (well, maybe Joffrey but that's it). It's unfortunate that I must wade through five more books to find out how this series is going to work out, but at least it's not this never ending series like \\"The Wheel of Time\\".  I hope the rest of the series is as impressive as this book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie was amazing in so many aspects.  The love story (although recycled and kinda rips off of Shakespeare in Love)works really well with Satine and Christian.  You follow their love and you feel for their happiness and sorrow...at the end.  The music was excellent.  \\"come what may\\" was especially a beautiful song.  Some people are complaining about the use of modern music in this movie!  That is just to help the audience relate themselves to people in that era.  Demonstrating that love and sex and whatever problems that existed back then still exist today!!  It's to bring the characters into the movie.  Although I agree that the relationship between some of the characters were undeveloped, we have to remember that if we developed every relationship between everyone (say between Zidler and Satine) the movie would drag on and on for hours exploring nothing but the psychological and sociological relationships of people who aren't the main focus of the movie.  That would really take away from what the movie is trying to say!!  There is a reason why some actors are called supporting actors and why some are called the leads.  Furthermore, although the movie doesn't come out and tell you straight out the history between some characters, the movie seeks to show us multidimensions of the characters, like Zidler and Talous.  Anyhow, this movie was amazing, from the costumes and sets and amazing effects, to the wonderful acting of the Kidman and McGregor, to the beautiful music, and finally to the love story.  The DVD is great, the 2 disc sets are amazing!!  If you want a movie that will make you laugh, make you sing and make you cry...you've got to see Moulin Rouge!!
B00003CX5P|1.0|just a message to Goerge Lucas asking him, why do you insist on continuing these story..!???, YES star wars was marveleous, (at its time of production) and it is still so good now to watch, and the following two parts &quot;the Empire strikes back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was compatible with the First version and were suitable to be produced, but now, &quot;the phantom menace&quot; is so so ordinary, these kind of movies is not suitable at all for our time, the movie production technology is very high now, we dont need more space movies, the star wars triology is spectacular, it was unique and ...stop... any thing more will be so poor in comparison with the first one, pleeeeeaase, stop it Mr. Lucas, dont ruin what you did.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I had great expectations for the movie, but to be honest didn't have the patience to even watch it to the end.<br />The tunes, while nice, don't fit the period.<br />Just too much creative licence taken and the story, sigh, not worth watching for free, let alone buying it.<br />I enjoy musicals, but this one was disjointed and the story line ... a waste of time.
0525946284|3.0|I've just read my local library's copy of this book, it's not bad. I found the plot to be more or less believeable and generally well developed as were most of the characters. I do not think it is completely ridiculous to tell of a last minute sabotage attempt such as described in the story using virtually untrained women, that sort of thing does happen in so many things in real life. Follett writes of a desperate search for women who could do the mission and having to take what comes along, and the bureaucratic interference encountered when someone favored is rejected, that and the incompetence of some of the Nazi's is so true to life. The behavior of the women agents isn't exactly what you usually see in a war story but does sound like what I'd expect someone so untrained to do ( the two lesbians getting themselves captured by going out to dinner is an example)I did like the way Flick and Ruby handled themselves. FLick's new love, Paul, seemed kind of thrown in to me, I would've liked more development there. Greta, the German transevestite homosexual (actually named Gerhard) was sure a new one for a war story although he/she did work out pretty well. I could have done without the little bits of sex, they didn't really add to the story. My biggest complaint is with Mr. Follettt's writing style because every page is full of sentences like \\"He did this\\" or some other sort of fragments which really should have been cleaned up some.
B00005NWM3|3.0|SILVER SIDE UP is a good album by NICKELBACK. It has good riffs and some good lyrics and gives off a burst of energy that is missing from rock presently. NEVER AGAIN is the song that starts the album off and it is a good start. It deals with domestic abuse, but doesnt seem at all a whimpy song. HOW YOU REMIND ME is the big hit so far off this album that deals with a relationship gone bad. TOO BAD is the new single just released and I really like the song. It is a good rockin song that I think will follow REMIND ME to the top of the charts. JUST FOR is another solid song from the album, how can u not like a song with lyrics about ripping someones heart out!!! This is a good album for any rock fan and hopefully we can start to see all this pop wannabes disappear from the scene and more bands like NICKELBACK can replace them.
B00005QDW1|2.0|You really have to listen to this album more than once just to start to get a feel for it. It's not the same thing that put No Doubt on the top. When I think about how the band wrote the album while in Jamaica, I can see where some of the songs have been influenced. Overall, I'd say there is maybe one or two songs that you can totally groove to and think to yourself, &quot;This is still the No Doubt I remember.&quot; Other than that, they have changed. Don't buy it if you aren't ready for their change.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Great edition of a perennial classic comedy. I remember how daring this movie was when it was out in theaters. The extras are very nice.<br />Be warned! The case claims that the movie has Spanish subtitles in the options, it does NOT! A problem for me since I live in Mexico and was looking forward to friends watching it with me.
B000002ADT|5.0|There is nothing to say about this album that has not been said.  This album goes round and round, both when I play it and when it is in my carousel.  This CD makes me happy, and will make you happy too.  My mom even likes it, I put it on when she comes over to dinner.  Endlessly cool.
B00003CWTI|2.0|I thought I had missed an Oscar-contender when I didn't catch this one at the theater, so this is one I rented soon after it came out on DVD/video.  I'm glad I didn't waste the money.  I can't understand the appeal of this movie.<br />Although there are a few promising stories going on, none receive enough attention to hold my interest.  Granted, they are tied up better in the end than I expected, but that doesn't save it.  Instead of a film, Magnolia is more like a mini-series or soap opera condensed into one sitting - not just in its plot schizophrenia, either, but character development.  For example, most guys are portrayed as jerks but you are supposed to feel sorry for them anyway.<br />There is a lot of gratuitousness.  Whether in Tom Cruise's speech (the role I'm sure he has been dying to play for years) or the infamous raining of frogs, it goes over the top to the point of absurdity.  Some might find it as an attempt at dark comedy, but it falls short in my book.<br />The acting is what saves it from a one star rating.  They do try to work with what they have.  I'm sure no one would have noticed Magnolia at all if it hadn't been for an above-average cast.  But I for one am glad it's over with, and I don't plan on seeing it again.
B00005AACC|4.0|Hey if you liked the original Mission Impossible with it's cool gadgets, latex masks and surprise endings you will be mostly satisfied with MI 2.  The only bad thing about the story is it's very predictable.  Mission Impossible was great because of the complexity of the story, in MI 2 halfway through the movie you know exactly what is going on!<br />Many things can be said however for the special effects, the awesome stunts, (performed largely by the star himself Tom Cruise) and great cast.  Overall MI 2 is a success and definatley worth renting if not buying!  Especially if ya like Tom.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I really really like this cd...Prince has matured. He is speaking of things other than sex.  Yet some will disagree but that's alright too.  The music is definitely his, not D'Angelo or anyone else that came AFTER him.  His head seems to be clear, his thoughts focused and his music is back to the pit of his soul where we all (who enjoyed his earlier music)used to be. (Dove's Cry, Computer Blue, etc.).  Yeah, Yeah, he is back -large and in charge.  Change is good.  Nothing stays the same, and I for one am pleased that the changes he made makes him happy...you can hear it in his music.  The guitar solo's are upbeat and inspiring. The dance hook 1+1+1 is 3 is funky and Last December is completely opposite...soothing and kind to the soul.  I love this cd...Prince - good job, thank you.
0385505833|1.0|Carelessly banal, insipid,and cliche, this book is not worthy to be published under ANY name, much less a name that people buy because (with few exceptions) his books are a decent, if somewhat superficial, read. (Some are FAR better than others.) And this one is the worst of the lot. The worst of anyone's lot! I am a voracious reader &amp; read even some bad and mediocre books to the finish just to find out what happens.  I forced myself to keep reading this drivel until I just couldn't stand it any more and put it down, half finished. Yuck.

B000002MY3|5.0|This album is one of my favorites. I played it many times, and bought many CDs since, and I still go back to this one. The songs have very meaningful lyrics, that will make you think and sometimes remind you of people or episodes in your life. Most of the songs are about negative experiences, a cheating boyfriend, parents that don't care about their child's feelings, a depressed friend, but there are also some positive songs, like &quot;Head over heels&quot;, which is a very nice and ironic love song. The songs are real experiences or could easily be, and Alanis expresses real emotions in her intepretation of each song in the album. She has a great voice and is very talented. I actually don't like the rock genre very much, but this album is a must-have for any music fanatic.
0684800713|5.0|I was lucky enough to find this book at goodwill for 79 cents. I wasn't going to get it at first, but then I looked inside the front cover. The following message was written, <BR>&quot;Sam, I am sorry we did not spend more time together. Ciest la vie, Ernest Hemingway&quot; It was a copy from the late fifties. So It very well could be signed by him. And if it is whoever got rid of it is silly. If it is not his signature, oh well it is still a great book.
B000002UAR|5.0|Why this album is not touted as the Beatle's best I find somewhat appalling.  Enough has been said about that already, though.  Do not hesitate to play &quot;Revolver&quot; for your cats. They will live longer, and purr more frequently.
B00005TT77|5.0|I normally dislike tribute album especially people butchering the Beatles.  This album however, I love.  Rufus Wainwright's version of Across the universe is the highlight of the album, In My opinion.  Also the Blackcrows version of Lucy in the Sky and a version of Help , that even Lennon would be proud of. Strangely enough Jakob Dylan, Bob Dylans usually unenergetic voice becomes lively in I'm Looking Through you... I cannot help But wonder What Lennon would say about Bob's Kid doing a revamp of their song.<BR>On the other hand, The revamp of Revolution and Let it Be leave a lot to be desired.  But over all a good musical Tribute and a Highly recommended one from me!
B00000IPAX|3.0|The CD contains some good songs, my favorite's being &quot;Adam's song&quot; and &quot;All the good things&quot;, but some of them are a bit too much: too loud, too noisy, too punk, too hard. The songs contain explicit lyrics, so they should not be played around children. It's mostly not good background music so you won't be able to play it when you have guests, unless they are there for your 16th birthday party. Not many will be able to play this CD in the car and drive without having accidents, LOL, some songs are very hard rock and therefore could be very distracting while driving.<br />That said, some songs are actually good and you'll be able to listen to them with someone who is not into rock, but some of them will make any chillout fan flee. The band does write the texts and plays the music, which is not true of many young bands nowadays. So they deserve 3 stars.
B00005B36H|5.0|they have come a long way from their early days but i would like to say that their career got better. Using ideas of famous mythologist Joseph Campbell and outstanding psychologist Carl Jung they twist and break the rules of modern song writing by writing compelling songs with the best melodic riffs i've ever heard. For first time TOOL buyers, this one is a good choice, but you can't forget that all of them kick @$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0060930187|4.0|When I was sophomore in college, a classmate was a nice, articulate, bright, and beautiful young woman, who <BR>commited a suicide few months later.  I always wondered<BR>what would drive a privileged young person, with such<BR>bright prospects, to kill him/herself.  Ms. Plath's<BR>book finally gave me a startlingly and shockingly clear<BR>portrait of the gradual spiral of despair that culminates<BR>in the ultimate act of self-destruction.  Such mental<BR>illness strikes across all social, econmic, racial, and<BR>religiouls boundaries, but rarely has any author been<BR>so candid and courageous in chronicling his/her own<BR>humiliating and agonizing experiences.  It's worth noting<BR>that Ms. Plath died by suicide at the age of 31.<br />I cannot give it five stars, which is reserved for the<BR>likes of Edith Wharton's \\"Age of Innocence\\", but it's<BR>a gripping and harrowing must-read for anyone who ever<BR>wondered about the experience of mental illness.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|I bought \\"Escape\\" after I heard the single \\"Hero\\" (which I believe to be one of the most beautiful love songs ever written and performed...) and I wasnt expecting anything on the album to better this. (I havent heard Enriques first album yet.) Every once in a while a recording is released that restores some faith in the music industry, and \\"Escape\\" is one of the few. Why? I listen to this album from start to finish and never even consider skipping a single track. The entire album is quite refreshing, and somehow in contrast to the boyband songs that we have had recycled for our ears time and time again. \\"Escape\\", however, sounds more personal and more real. It is probably the closest thing to pop perfection since Abba. But this album also glows with the warmth of the Latino. 3 of the tracks are in Spanish (including a Spanish version of \\"Hero\\" which is sure to make you cry...) Enrique; what a voice! Swelling with romance, you will want to dance and cry throughout. This is an \\"Escape\\" to excellence for romantic nights in and romantic nights out. An indespenasable recording.
B000000OTU|5.0|I am listening to &quot;Big Ones&quot; on a contraband CD player at 2pm on Thursday.  All I can say is having this much fun at work has got to be illegal.
B000007ODM|5.0|I heard this for the first time in a jewelry shop in Turkey.  I bugged the staff until they told me the name of the group (had to get an interpreter eventually).  After getting back to the states ordered it immediately.  What an amazing disc.  Reminiscent of Enigma and Adiemus, but manages to find its own niche in the style, rather than just aping the style.  Enigma focuses more on being techno than Era, and Adiemus focuses more on tribal vocals than Era.  Era has wailing guitars, classical orchestrations, medeival latin choirs and a strong beat to go along with it all.  The only thing about it that is a shame is that they remix two songs on the same disc.  This gives a fairly repetitive feel (but not worth taking away a star).
0446608955|4.0|Well, I'm a guy. And this book was only the second &quot;romance&quot; novel I've ever read. And I bought it for my 13-year-old daughter--but then I decided to read it first after seeing the words &quot;first love&quot; on the back cover. I wanted to see exactly what kind of &quot;love&quot; author Sparks had in mind. Anyway, this novel was pretty good. And I DID cry, just like the main male character, Landon Carter--the &quot;I&quot; of this 1st-person narrative--assured me I would. But the story was VERY predictable. I haven't read Sparks's other books, so I don't know how they compare to _A Walk to Remember_. But one thing that really distracted me was the &quot;tone&quot; of the writing.Sparks has the older adult Carter reminiscing about when the story occured, but has him telling it in the language a high schooler would use. From the get-go and throughout the entire book, however, I imagined this story being told by the ADULT Carter--as if he and I were sitting in front of the fireplace. So, to me, the language didn't match the age of the one doing the reminiscing. In spite of that, I really loved the story. And it's not at all trashy. Which is why my daughter is reading the book now...as I type.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|A very clever and funny movie. This move was not marketed towards children. It's parents who assume all animated movies are for children that are upset. It's rated &quot;PG&quot; parental guidence. If it were a movie explicitly for children, it wouldn't have been made to hold a PG rating.
B00005U18E|3.0|I LOVED the book, Bridget Jone's Diary, so much that I immediately went out and bought the sequel.  I even stayed up all night reading it.  Both books are hilarious and utterly charming.  Needless to say, I was really looking forward to the movie.  Unfortunately, I thought it was a cheapened version of the story.  Renee' Zellweger is a fabulous Bridget and Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (Oh my!  He is gorgeous!!)do an admirable job of portraying Cleaver and Darcy.  However, the supporting cast of friends and co-workers are abyssmal portraying characters with no redeeming qualities--very unlike the book!  My biggest complaint of all is that Bridget, with all of her flaws and quirks, is one of the most loveable and sympathetic literary heroines to come along in quite some time and this movie portrays her life and her friends' lives as vacuous.  Where the book is charming, the movie is simply foul.  For anyone who loves Jane Austen's P & P and stories with any integrity, this is not the movie for you.
B000002BQK|5.0|BUTTERFLY was the first CD I bought of her's, followed by MUSIC BOX which I bought on tape a while ago when CD's weren't too common.  I bought this album as one usually does, for songs played on the radio (here being \\"Honey\\", \\"My All\\" and \\"Breakdown.\\")  The songs she released on the radio, however, are no match for the rest of the jeweles that create this masterpiece!  There are few albums that I can listen to ALL the way through.  This one is one of them, no doubt!  People complain about this album as \\"too much of a change\\" or \\"not her style\\" and \\"I know Mariah, this isn't Mariah.\\" Personally I think this is her best work up-to-date.  MUSIC BOX included too much sappy stuff, which most of her older fans seem to enjoy (who by the way are most likely adults who listen to lite fm stations).  Anyways, here's a profile on some of my favorite songs on the album.<br />My All- I simply had this song listened out after hearing it too much.  She sings it beautifully and it's very emotional. This song is a true product of her song-writing skills.<br />Breakdown- Though I have never heard of Bone Thugs 'n Harmony before this song, I respect them so much  now because this is one of her best songs out there collaboration-wise.  It even comes very close to \\"One Sweet Day\\" with Boyz 2 Men.  It's a nice-mellow dance jam that can be listened to over and over again.<br />Whenever You Call- This is really a *beautiful* song!!!  This is one of my favorite ballads out of all the singers I've listened to.  I would have liked it however if she would have included the version with Brian McKnight, but maybe that one came a little later.<br />Fly Away (Butterfly remix)- It's not a favorite but I have a good comment about it. It was very nice of her to put this one in.  It's a good break from the ballads of \\"Close My Eyes\\" and \\"Whenever You Call.\\"  Gives us a little \\"jolt\\" before listening to the last two medium-speed songs.<br />The Beautiful Ones- I swear Dru Hills sounds like Prince. I didnot know it was him until reading these reviews!  In fact I didn't even know it was a Prince song until I looked inside the cover.  It was very well covered and it maybe goes on a little too long, but not by much.<br />Outside- Peronsally my favorite ballad out of the whole album. Simply Beautiful!  Very emotional and we can all relate to it in one point or another in our life.  A great ending track for an awsome album!<br />Overall this album is, as stated in my title, SUPERB!  She blends a variety of music tastes ranging from Pop to Hip-Hop to Soul and yes...to Adult Contemporary.  A must buy!  Mariah fan or not!
B00005ASQ1|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and felt moved to cry.  It reminded me so much of myself. No, I am not a basketball player but I did fence in college and was state champion twice.  I am also black.  Further, I had a white teacher while I was in high school who nutured me in intellectual ways that my parents could not. Her mentoring opened my vision of what I could be and a window for me into a larger world. I also met white teachers that felt my work was remarkable for a kid from my background and conditions.  While viewing this movie, I vividly remembered what it was like to move within white circles and never be fully accepted by people that claimed to promote me on the one hand, but disparaged me on the other. For those who have never been a Jamal Wallace it might seem a cliche of a movie. But for those who have lived the challenges sited in this film, it is true to life.  I particularly like the scenes that showed the closeness of his family, and the distancing of Jamal from his neighborhood friends as he began to progress and change. This distancing is what almost every young person is afraid of, but must face at some time in his or her youth. I recommend this as a fine film for young black kids in &quot;mean&quot; or &quot;not so mean&quot; streets who are offered a way up. I also recommend it for people who are struggling with what it means to be truly intellectually gifted in a world (black and white)that has no place for that. I have not seen &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, the trailers did not impress me. And thank God for that. People who can watch this movie with open hearts and minds will find it a pleasant, thoughtful mirror that reflects pressures and sensitivities of intellectually gifted blacks and artists who demonstrate promise before their time.
0790729628|4.0|I have owned and enjoyed the VHS tape of the movie for years.  After seeing the Director's Cut on DVD, I would say the changes made were almost not worth the effort.  The unicorn scene is ambiguous, but it was interesting to watch the film without listening to the voiceover.  I feel Ridley Scott could have done much more, by adding edited scenes.  Negatives: it was shocking to find this DVD was not shown in widescreen, or letterbox.  Also, one can see dirt and other debris in a couple of scenes that was not removed from the original celluloid copy for this DVD.  Positives:  it is a joy to watch this film in DVD and see everything in much better sharpness.  Hopefully, the 20th Anniversary Edition due out later this year will correct the deficiencies.
B000003N7K|5.0|I sometimes wonder which instrument is more sensual,<BR>  Johnny Hartmans voice or John coltranes tenor.<BR>  Coltranes respect for johnny hartman is evident in his<BR>  rich,less is better accompaniment.A gentle John coltrane<BR>  to blend with the cool, relaxed unhurried style of johnny  <BR>  Hartman.What a perfect marriage, and probably at a time when<BR>  both artist were at the top of their talent.<BR>  My alltime favorite album.

B000007NYS|5.0|Where have they been hiding Lucinda Williams all these years? Why aren't these songs - - her songs as sung by her - - standard hits?!? I am so grateful that I stumbled across VH1's Top 100 Women of Rock-n-Roll show last year, and as a lark, decided to watch it.  My first thought was &quot;how did they actually come up with 100 women in rock-n-roll?&quot;...that half-hour episode happened to be the one that included Lucinda Williams. From what I heard, she sounded like something I'd like, so I made a mental note to check her out. I am kicking myself for waiting so long! You know how it is when you go cd shopping...you fill up your basket, and then you realize you're spending way too much so you put things back for another time. Well, I kept putting Lucinda back! I finally purchased this cd (with Xmas gift money, so I splurged, guilt-free!) and it has not left my cd player since! <br />I would describe these songs as heartfelt, edgy, and very real, with stories we can all relate to.  'Side of the Road' has got to be one of the greatest songs I've ever heard...it really touched me by effectively articulating that need to occasionally identify myself separately, not only from my husband, but even from my children. This re-release also has a bonus track of a live version, and it is so beautiful! 'I Just Wanted to See You So Bad' is one of those songs that oozes that intensely wonderful, all consuming, sense of urgency, when a relationship is new; 'Like a Rose' is just heavenly; very Velvet Underground/Sunday Morning-ish; and, of course, the well-known 'Passionate Kisses', I think Lucinda's version is much more effective and exudes a deeper message than Mary Chapin Carpenter's, which I always found to be kind of grating and pop-ish.  I find the cd as a whole to be delightfully under-produced, which gives it a very personal atmosphere, and the musicians in the band are obviously top-notch and &quot;tight&quot;! <br />I don't know how you would categorize this music; folk/country/bluesy with a rockin' edge? This must be why we don't hear these songs on the usual radio stations, and it is a shame that a huge percentage of the general population will never be exposed to their magnificence.  I am completely sold and am going to be scooping up all of Lucinda William's other recordings asap!
0780619951|3.0|Assuming this movie was intended to be a serious sci-fi thriller, I would say it failed miserably in that aspect. It was a horrible movie the first time I saw it. The second time, I realized how funny it was, especially Brando and Mini-Brando. In my opinion, its not worth owning in a serious collection, but a good rental.
B00000JQFL|5.0|This has got to be one of the best albums ever put together.  From the opening introduction which sets the stage for an explosive concert setting.  You can feel the &quot;fire&quot; as the rhythmns thump in your heart.  Each and every song leaves you with satisfication.  Although most groups never sound like their songs do when they record them in in the studio, this &quot;live&quot; reproduction sounds like the originals.  You can hear voices, notes, horns, the whole works.  As a musician myself, I can appreciate the &quot;tightness&quot; of each piece.  This album will forever go down as one of the best &quot;live&quot; recordings ever!
B00003W8NM|4.0|When I feel that a film is good enough to earn three stars, that's saying something. I'm extremely picky when it comes to grading movies, and base it on several factors: plot, script, acting, directing and overall enjoyment, all of which are extremely hard to accomplish, and together almost impossible in my opinion. So here's my opinion on 'Fight Club': <br />Plot: Though strange, unusual and disturbing, it's incredibly original and totally away from the 'norm' that Hollywood has been forcing us to watch. 5 stars. <br />Script: The script is clever and makes you think, but it sarcastic to the point that 'Fight Club' is funnier than most comedies we see nowadays...in a way, that's sad, but helps the film. 5 stars.<br />Acting: Edward Norton does a fantasic job as &quot;Narrator&quot; or &quot;Jack&quot;, and is the highlight of this film. Brad Pitt also gives a wonderful performance, but is overshadowed by Norton's. 4 stars.<br />Directing: David Fincher deserved an Oscar for this. It's unfortunate that his film was left in the dust because of M. Night Shymalan's 'The 6th Sense', the two very similar. 5 stars.<br />Overall Enjoyment: 'Fight Club' was by far one of the best movies I've ever seen, and after watching it...well...I'll be buying the DVD eventually. The extras are great, funny, and probably one of the better buys out there. 5 stars.<br />So all in all, 'Fight Club' is a great movie and is worth the two hours you put into watching it. <br />My opinion: 4.5 stars at least.
0786867973|5.0|Lawson has infused recipes with her wit and straightforward cooking style.  She reveals that she often 'messes up' a recipe, and yet her error does not affect the final product.  She is a steady guide for young cooks or, those tired of cooking for perfection.  Lawson is a comfort in the cooking world - however small or large that world might be to you.  Her book is easy to read and her recipes are intriguing.  They are simple and beg to be tried - over again.  This is a great book for a first timer who is intimidated by baking, and for a well seasoned cook.
1556154844|4.0|I like this book and believe that the information in it is critical knowledge that every programmer should have, and that there may not be a better book available for these kinds of core programming techniques and principles.  I especially liked the section at the beginning that discusses the true nature of good programming (using the metaphor &quot;Software Construction&quot;), the principles of Team Programming, and the cost of discovering errors in design and coding too late.<br />Having said this, I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 for several reasons.<br />First, the book is outdated.  It uses examples from languages such as Fortran and Basic to make its points, languages which are not in widespread use anymore.  It brings up the GOTO argument, an old argument made irrelevant by most programming languages today.  It discusses Object Oriented programming from a viewpoint that it is still in its infancy.  <br />Second, I disagree with some of the author's conclusions, among which is the code indentation techniques. The author claims that indentation is not required within structures such as loops, but I claim that without this indentation it is impossible to visually set off the loop code from the rest of the code.<br />Finally, I get the uneasy feeling that the person who needs this information most desperately (the neophyte programmer) might not understand the examples given without already being a pretty good programmer, and good programmers should already have a good grasp of the principles in this book.<br />Bottom line:  If you are an experienced programmer (like I am), you can probably look beyond the outdated examples and the author's opinions, and extract some information from this book that will be useful to you.  <br />If you are a beginning programmer I am not convinced that this book would be useful to you as an individual read.  You might be better off using it as a supplement while you learn your programming language of choice.
B000002GXS|5.0|If so, get a jug of wine, sit on the floor and let this cd slip into your soul. A suffocating, stately meditation on missed connections. Why this isn't a staple on the jukebox of every crummy dive bar in America, I have no idea. Its about going out or away because thats what you know best-and feeling the emptiness that it invites. Piano, sax, crooning, the West Side Highway,your beat up car, 4am at the bodega, its all here. Waits has got to be the most eloquent articulator of loss Ive ever heard.
006019250X|5.0|I thought there is no other book like \\"The Little Prince\\" until I found this book. It remind me of the past, and it made me so passionate about it. This is the second book I love and I would love to introduce this book to the people around the world.... who is searching the treasure, or the fulfilling their dreams, love. The Omen, a lot of people treat it as a sign of God, for me, I treat it as an art; the art of senses. And I loved what Paulo talked about \\"The Beginner's Luck\\". Very closely related to my experience in life. Read it, I bet you will fall in love with it. Read it with a pure and simple heart. If you are too realistic, I dont recommend this book to you.
0425129608|5.0|Another master piece by Agatha. While Poirot is on a vacation,a woman hated by most of her gender, is found dead on a beach. Since all the hotel members think her husband did it, Poirot sets out to prove them wrong. This is another well-written mystery that will shock you when you read the ending.
B00005K3O4|4.0|This 1988 kult klassic is (finally!) on DVD, one of the titles in MGM's Midnite Movie Collection, and we are happier than Charles Nelson Reilly and a tube of grease(paint). A spaceship---looking just like a circus tent---lands in a field in a small town...unleashing a korps of killer klowns, red-nosed klutzes who kill, maim and cotton-candy people to death. It's madcap, maniacal magic that makes Alien look tame. The DVD also contains deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer and a slew of bloopers...we're not klowning around when we say this is a horrifying hootx
B000003BDY|5.0|Yes, the boys really were this young once, with Mick in jacket and tie no less!  &quot;12 x 5&quot; was released in the mid- 60s when the Stones still demonstrated the deep effect that Blues had on them. This is serious music, a far cry from the sound and fury of the Giants Stadium concert I saw in '97. High points are a rendition of Chuck Berry's &quot;Round and Round&quot;, a plaintive &quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot;, and their single hit &quot;Its All Over Now&quot;. The boys hit their peak with a wailing &quot;If You Need Me&quot; and especially with an A+ performance of &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot;. From one who loves the Drifters, that is the highest praise. If you like the Stones of the '70s and later, use &quot;12x5&quot; to examine their roots. This one is a no lose purchase.  Go ahead and hit the &quot;add to my cart&quot; button!
B000002KHH|5.0|This is the second great Metal album. The first is the Sabs debut.<BR>Taking up the experimental scaps of Hendrix and Cream, Led Zeppelin defined hard rock.<BR>Thematically energized from \\"Dazed and Confused\\" Black Sabbath wrote the <BR>book on Heavy Metal.  The difference? THEMES and ARRANGEMENTS. <BR>HARD ROCK LYRIC - I saw a woman last night.....  <BR>METAL LYRIC - Satan found me in the night.<BR>When thinking of the overall feel of PARANOID, <BR>I find myself reduced to thinking of it in single words. <BR>Words like: Clunky.......Corroded.......Trippy......Scary....Silly<BR>Evocative.......Clever.....Unpredictable......Funny (bad horror <BR>movie funny)....Bleak.......Engaging....Uncompromising ......... <BR>Cohesive and above all else ESSENTIAL.

6304143184|5.0|I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it to my most resent viewing with my children, ages 4 and 5. This movie is one of the best sci-fi movies that really makes me feel that there are others out there.  My children loved the movie and wanted me to find one to buy.  I can't wait to add it to our collection of movies.
B000003B6J|5.0|The best gangsta rap album of all time.  Forget compilations, forget greatest hits.  This is straight thru, front to back.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I love this movie! Although it is a bit \\"young\\" so to speak for my age, I still found it hilarious. Reese Witherspoon is adorable and truely funny in this movie. A no brainer way to watch a movie.
B00005A7BR|5.0|This cd contains two discs... The first one is the Affirmation Disc (13 tracks) which contains all the songs in the regular Affirmation cd.<br />The bonus disc is called the Declaration Disc (11 tracks)... which was recorded live at the Brisbane Entertainment Center during May 20-21 of 2000.  It contains all the recorded live versions of the songs from the Affirmation disc, except for &quot;The Animal Song&quot;.<br />However, the Affirmation Disc has a bonus track, which is &quot;The Animal Song (Hex Hector Club Mix)&quot;...  The cd also has a CD Rom feature with detailed notes about the Affirmation CD, video clips, pictures, and links to websites.<br />All of the extra features (the bonus cd, bonus track, and CD Rom features) are not a necessity.  But is very collectible for the ultimate Savage Garden fan.  Enjoy!
0451191153|4.0|I liked the book a lot.  It is a very nice book for those who believe in the good of people.  A very good example of how simple life should be but how easy we complicate it all the time.<BR>A very long book but it is worth the time.  It is a little too much into architecture but I like the message behind it.
0385495315|5.0|I picked up this book before a term in which I was planning to do a course in Cryptography. This book got me into the groove, so to speak. A very easy read and an excellent introduction to the field of Cryptography for the layman.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Historic title aside, it's a Hollywood love story.  Consider yourselves warned
B000002JB8|5.0|I own several Vangelis CDs, and I have to say that, after my first listen to &quot;Oceanic,&quot; I was somewhat disappointed.  I felt that a couple of the songs were very relaxing, but for the most part, the harmonies and melodies eluded me.  Nothing really stood out to me the way songs on &quot;1492&quot; and &quot;Themes&quot; did.  <br />But I didn't give up, and I feel that a couple of the negative reviews of this album reflect people who might have stopped listening to it too quickly.  Every time I listened, another melody would appear out of nowhere like magic, or another instrument would suddenly surface.  The tunes began to stick with me, and I found myself humming them long after the CD ended.  Most importantly, a loved one at the time began to find the music incredibly romantic.  <br />Now, the CD has become one of my favorite Vangelis CDs.  I have owned it for months, and the music is STILL growing on me.  As a result, I doubt I will ever grow &quot;sick&quot; of it.  If you like calming, relaxing, romantic music, then trust me:  this CD is perfect for you.  Listen especially for the last two songs, &quot;Memories of Blue,&quot; and &quot;Song of the Seas.&quot;
B00003CXZ3|5.0|this movie is odd and i love odd movies. its almost quentin tarantino-ish. it starts at the end and goes in reverse the whole time till it gets to the beginning. it's abt this guy that is involved in an \\"incident\\" and loses his short term memory. he takes polaroids to remember people and places (i.e. where he stays, what he drives, his friends, etc.) i was very surprised at how it ended (or began if you want to get technical) it's a really good movie especially if you like twisted weird things. i recommend it to everyone! you won't be disappointed.
6305132984|1.0|There were men dancing ... dancing! But let me explain a bit further ... or try to. You see, they weren't simply dancing, they were prancing and frolicing around ... you know, like little boys and girls eating cookies and candycanes in a field of flowers. That's what I saw! I swear it! But that's not all. They all wore costumes, or little outfits, too, as if it were Halloween. These are grownup men and women, I remind you, wearing the strange costumes and doing the dancing and prancing ... grownups! I do realize that this silliness has its reasons, that the film has a message, and so on, but -- sweet Lord! -- filmakers, can't you find another form of expression than this! Perhaps by painting a picture, writing a book, a poem -- can't you illuminate your message another way? Why have you chosen to make fools out of so many men?  And women, too -- I'm not a sexist! You made both the sexes look like fools!<br />I gave this joke of a movie one star, not because I had to, but because I felt it should get one, just one, for its positive message.
B000002B2X|4.0|Alice in Chains released a gem of an EP that captures them in their element, acousticly.  &quot;Brother&quot; is a chilling song that could send chills down your spine, &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; is one of AIC's best songs ever written, &quot;Right Turn&quot; falls nothing short of amazement and it features Chris Cornell as an added bonus, and &quot;Am I Inside&quot; is creepy and even more chilling than &quot;Brother&quot;.  Recommended to any and every AIC fan.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I don't own this dvd. My little brother borrowed it from a friend, and I watched it with him and my other little brothers. I know I shouldn't be reviewing, since I don't own this, but watching it made me so mad, and I want you to know why. I'm upset because the movie uses dirty jokes to be funny and claims to be a kids' film. Sometimes dirty jokes can be funny, I know that, but when you're a little kid you don't know what they mean or why they're funny. After one punchline one of my brothers turned around as if to ask me what it meant. That made me sick.  It makes me sick how people make movies they say are for kids and then put dirty, even mean, material in them. Don't moviemakers know how sensitive and easily influenced kids are? I'm a 21-year-old college guy and know better!
B00003CXB7|4.0|I loved M*A*S*H the first time I saw it, but this video, which claims to be uncut has left out the \\"severed carotid artery\\" scene.  Therefore I can only give it 4 stars.
B00005KFUM|5.0|I bought the CD four days ago (waiting a month now for it to come in =P) but i burned it before....its an incredible piece of work. The first song i heard, Plug-In Baby, is certainly a great song, but Newborn takes the cake for a true masterpiece of a song. \\"feeling good\\" is another great song ...ok, the entire album was simply stunning. Buy it. trust me.
B00003CXTG|1.0|If it was possible to rate this movie less than a single star I would have.  As an historical portrayal of WWII events, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is the motion picture equivalent of &quot;Hogan's Heroes.&quot;  But as silly as that series was, it had much better acting, writing, directing, and sensitivity to the actual victims of the war than this latest Bay/Bruckheimer waste of celluloid.
B000002HAF|4.0|I first heard doolittle in about 1994 and was instantly hooked, when I could i bought all the other albums, the last of which was surfer rosa. I wont say I liked it first time, infact I thought a dissappointment. In retrospect I was young and foolish, since listening to the album again and again I have grown to appreciate the raw genius of this album. Some tracks are to harsh and some sound dated, however as a whole it is an explosion of emotion, seemingly rage! \\"where is my mind\\" has been a favourite of mine since i first heard it on death to the pixies. Undiluted, pure, uncommercialised emotional expression through rock!
B000005RT8|1.0|Just think... this was the same guy who did &quot;Penny Lane&quot; + &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. Musta been some good stuff he was growing on his ranch...
B000002H8F|4.0|Crisper than doolittle its introduction of little jingly background melody helpers is all very nice, but does it lose something? maybe...still not as good as doolittle, but my some amazing tunes, I can't believe no one has mentioned is she weird! the bass, the beat and the screams of franky boy!!!...we'll leave it there!
B00005OMTT|5.0|This CD is a compolation of Enigmas greatest works! People may recognize the song Return to Innocense, but there are others as equally powerful, such as Gravity of Love or Modern Crusaders. <BR>This CD is quite powerful. By that I mean the style of music feels very motivational.<br />Althought, I do need to point out that some copies actually were given the Parental Advisory Label, I scoff at this. The music contained on this remarkable CD is not vulgar, nor violent... granted it could be a little.. suggestive is the sound arther than word, but even then, it sould be view more for it's art and beauty than this. Enigma is known for their sensual and motivational pieces... and this one is their best.<br />Each track is mixed in seamlessly with the next, causing each song to play into the other. The only way you can determin this is if you put a single song or repeat.<br />Overall, this is a grand CD worthy of notice!
B000002H72|5.0|I heard it first about 1994, it was on repeat in the background, i had no idea I was listening to it until i started humming along to the songs...I am not an out an out rock freak but my god this is one of the best rock albums (if not best albums) of all time. Loud emotion, unpredictable melodies and lyrics, a guitar sound that sounds like a monkey is playing and drums that a wife beater seems to be having a beef with! Never gets tedious.
B00004UFYU|4.0|This is a rather hard-to-find CD produced in France. But it's well worth the buy.<br />The music is very soothing and tranquil, and several times I've sued it to either read books or set my mind at ease. The style is best described as Neo-Gothic. The music has French chanting with a mix of electric instruments as well... over all this is a very fine CD and was actually reccomended to me by a friend in Denmark, where the CD is a bit more popular
B00003CXXI|4.0|This excellent animated feature from Dreamworks is basically a swipe at rivals Disney.  It turns the fairytale story on its head, with the hero being a big, ugly but amicable ogre (Mike Myers).  With his sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy) he goes off to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) in order to reclaim his land back from Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), which has been overrun by fairytale beasts.<br />'Shrek' is most fun when taking a stony-faced literal look at the fairytale world - i.e. the three blind mice carry canes, Snow White isn't easy despite living with seven men and there's also a wonderful gingerbread man that yells 'eat me' at his tormentors.  The distraction of toilet humour is, unfortunately, to be expected in such movies.  Also good is the acting, with Eddie Murphy having the time of his life.  In fact, 'Shrek' is worth watching for his performance alone.  The big name advertising for the movie does beg the question though, of where is animation headed?  The answer is, that the producers wanted to capitalise on its winning formula of good jokes and winning animation, where you can literally see each blade of grass rustling in the wind.  Most importantly, it's a movie that both adults and children will enjoy, which is always a treat amongst most of today's animated fare.<br />Even so, the light-rock soundtrack doesn't always fit and sometimes you're left feeling whether 'Shrek' is intentionally modern.  Plus there's the obvious comparisons to the 'Toy Story' movies, which could hardly be bettered by many movies, let alone another animated one.  Saying that, 'Shrek' really is excellent, a break from tradition and its slightly bitter asides will be loved by adults.
B00003CX96|5.0|This film set a new standard for the modern coming-of-age film.  It puts a new light on the tradition set by such movies as Shane, and To Kill a Mockingbird. It is certainly sweeter than either of them, but in its own way, poignant, touching, and easier to identify with for the post-war generation.  OK - the matters at hand are trivial in the long run, but they are no less real or familiar to those who grew up as baby-boomers and later.  <BR>    Dave Stoller dreams big - though the dreams are so far out of place for a kid from the midwest, that they seem like sheer fantasy.  The film shows that these dreams, and the passion that drives them, are what are to be sought.  Cyril, Mike, and Moocher seem rudderless by comparison, and by the film's climax, it is clear that even fantasy masquerading as dreams are preferred to none at all.  <BR>    The characters are enough to make you watch this film again and again, Paul Dooley's long-suffering but ultimately sincere, loving father, Barbara Barrie's mother comes off as flaky at first, but proves to be the most sensible of the bunch when all is done.  <BR>    Of course the characters here set Daniel Stern and Dennis Quaid on the paths of stardom - this film is still their 2nd or 3rd highest rated performances.  <BR>    My biases as a cyclist do show up with this film - in the truck racing sequence and in the Little 500, my legs start pumping involuntarily - and I usually end up heading out for a good ten or twenty miles.  And it's the best video for stationary bikes, bar none!  Dave's dreams can do us all a lot of good.
0553345834|4.0|This is a good if over-rated book. If a lot of what he recommends here isn't already instinctive in you, you probably weren't meant to be an entrepreneur. He goes on endlessly about how you should be as silent as much as possible in negotiations. I went into negotiations after reading that thinking that's what I'd better do. Then I realized that's what I'd been doing the whole time without having to be told. An arrogance bleeds through the lines a bit too often. And being a sports agent, to me, is about as frivolous a profession as there could be. When I first heard the term &quot;sports agent&quot; I literally thought it was a joke. Bill Murray said the reason Mike Ovitz failed as an executive at Disney is, &quot;He went from a simple commission business as a talent agent to the much more complex business of Disney. That's why he failed.&quot; And McCormack runs a talent agency, basically. And a lot of readers will probably be involved in much more complex businesses, for whom his advice will be dubious at best. But with those major reservations, I still think it's a book worth reading.
B00005R87Q|3.0|Although the visual effects are impressive and the cars are fantastic the storyline is lacking in substance.  There isn't enough believability in the plot or the characters.  The chemistry between the actors is almost non-existent and you almost cheer for the antagonists.  The real stars of the movie are the fast, flashy automobiles because that's all you want to see but you don't see enough of them.   To sum it up I would have to say this movie is for the car lover but not for the film lover.
B00005B1EX|5.0|There's no mistaken this voice for anyone elses. Finally, a modern day rock recording with BALLS!!! This is clean loud thunderous face splitting crunch! Most all of todays hard rock bands stink! Their guitars sound like they have a cold.........it's either that or their owner is just falling short of the true guitar potential. Get this CD in your player today and share some of that reserve volume with your neighbors. There is statement spoken on this CD just prior to the song \\"into the pit\\". This statement pretty much sums things up for all the teeny-bopp'n bubble gummers who thinks RAP and ROCK go together. Like I said............. the RESERVE VOLUME PLEASE!
0061020680|4.0|I always knew that Terry Prachett was funny, but when I got stuck in Orange County Airport for more hours than I planned,  I actually found myself busting out laughing while reading Mort.  Considering how bad of a mood I was in, I see this as high praise.  Although there are other Diskworld books that I liked more, this one isn't too far down my list of favorites.
0375420525|4.0|OK, probably the main qualm most have with House of Leaves and its originality is its striking similarity to Wallace's Infinite Jest. Firstly, you can read either with the knowledge that both authors took years to write either manuscript (in the case of Danielewski, ten I believe), so both can be judged as wholly orignal, or as original as anything can be.  Though what a pair!  Similarities which include (though \\"this list is by no means exhaustive\\"):<BR>1. Extended foot notes -- Both use long (occasionally tedious, usually intentionally so) footnotes in their novels to forward the plots momentum or create a mood. The main difference is that while Wallace usually reserves his footnotes for mainly inconsequential data (and the final bound pages), Danielewski's are often extended plots or potent motif within themselves which are built right into (often Inside) the narrative.<BR>2. Subject matter -- Captivating film, many rounded characters, magic realism, math (my own private battlefield), obsessive fathers with neglected wives, multiple plots, post-post-postmodern (are we there yet?) tactics...<BR>3. Narrator(S)-- Both novels utilize a series of narrators to offer new stories and plots.<BR>4. Degree of difficulty -- Both novels, though highly rewarding, prod the reader through verbal labrynths and paper-cut inducing note-hunts. Hard to read, but in a fun \\"I-can't-believe-how-long-this-is-taking-me-but-won't-my-friends-and-former-teachers-be-impressed\\" way.<BR>In the end, the fact alone that either of these books exist and were written by mere mortals (mere Young mortals) is testament to the standards we hold for good fiction today. There is usually a scarce number of good NEW books out there to read, so even if these two whales happen to look the same on the outside, you still won't know what hit you once you reach the last page (the term \\"last page\\" used loosely).
0375507507|5.0|You will be carried away to a childhood in a foreign land..foreign to Westerners at least..and be the better for it.  I surely appreciate the U.S.A., but find it somewhat difficult to understand the preference of living in Africa and foregoing all the amenities offered in &quot;more civilized&quot; territories.  There is a charm in the telling of this tale and also a sharp edge of living conditions that I would not wish to put up with.  The author does well indeed to keep things interesting.  I read this book out loud to my wife and it is a winner (my wife also agrees)!
B00005QZWI|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, a film score is best when it isn't calling attention to itself. Outside of the movie, a score can still sound good enough to stand on its own, but that isn't its primary purpose. This soundtrack isn't quite memorable enough to stay in my head after I've left the theater.<br />I noticed immediately that the Hobbit Theme used throughout sounds remarkably like the love theme written by James Horner for Titanic. This threw me off a bit.<br />I also wondered why I couldn't find the dramatic suspense music written so admirably into the theatrical trailers. That music really made me want to see the movie, and I still hear it in my head often, especially the section where Pippin accidentally drops the skeleton in Moria. Now I know the cues were recut for the trailer, but I remember the music being in the movie.<br />A soundtrack that completely stands out in my mind is the almost perfect Star Wars Episode IV, by John Williams. Each track is evocative of the scenes in the film, yet they hold up with just a music player and your imagination. Unfortunately, the LOTR score is no Star Wars.<br />All in all, I was kind of disappointed, but other buyers may enjoy the soundtrack even with these criticisms.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It is undoubtedly one of this year's most polarizing movies - Moulin Rouge, directed by Baz Luhrmann and starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. Some film critics have put a lot of effort in trying to write as negative movie reviews as possible - the movie has been declared as all too banal. But it might also be stated that this film is a cleverly done persiflage, the work of a genius, a master of creating colorful and powerful images. <BR>Firstly, critics have argued that the story behind the movie is full of clichs and simply dull. They might not have considered the fact that Luhrmann uses these clichs, such as the often cited \\"boy meets girl meets doom\\", fully consciously. 'Moulin Rouge' can be regarded as a very entertaining parody of the musical genre. Luhrmann constantly gives reference to what is generally known as typical musical elements, such as the overly emotional dramaturgy accumulating to a tearful climax. The attribute \\"banality\\" is by no means justified. As a very neat feature, the director constructs an extremely entertaining parallelism between the movie's story proper and the content of the play that the characters in the movie rehearse. <BR>It might have been unclear to most critics that this movie definitely is a musical. So complaints about flat, unsophisticated dialogues rather seem of no use. Witty conversation or a complicated storyline is certainly not what musicals aim at. However, what does play an important role in a movie like `Moulin Rouge', is the music. It has been widely criticized that the clash between the historical scenario and the music consisting of commonly known pop songs was too enormous. In fact, using well known songs for new musical projects is a frequently used method which was especially popular during the forties and fifties. This method is a very clever tool in order to lose the historical distance between the audience and the scenario. By taking up familiar music for the soundtrack, the director creates a directlink between his audience and the  story.<BR>Another reproach is that the song parts of the medleys are too chopped; by sticking together only small splinters of love song classics like \\"I Will Always Love You\\", \\"Up Where We Belong\\" or \\"Your Song\\", the spirit of the various songs are lost. Therefore, according to critics, pieces like the love song medley cannot touch the heart of the audience. However, this collage of love songs is much more likely to touch the audience because it causes interaction. On watching the movie, the audience is constantly trying to figure out which song is being referred to, and consciously thinking about the lyrics, so that the overall message \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return\\" can be perfectly well received.<BR>Luhrmann has also been accused of not being able to handle the speed of the movie: according to film reviewers the atmosphere created by the astonishing kick off with fast, almost MTV-like editing then all of a sudden collapses into a too old stereotypical love story. Looking at this from another angle, the powerful opening scene should rather be interpreted as an overture  - a direct access for the audience to get at once into the Moulin Rouge feeling. <BR>The big plus of the movie is the entertainment factor - and that is what a musical is all about. The comedic presentation of the characters, the impresario Harold Zidler and the Can-Can dancers and the wonderful music contributes to a movie that is probably not full of surprises but comes up with breathtaking visual arrangements, wonderful music and beautiful pictures. It is definitely worth watching.
0671024256|4.0|A little self-serving, but otherwise good. I think if King actually writes a whole autobiography, it will be as riveting as his novels. Much of the writing advice he gave has been said many times before. Anyone who's taken a college or even a high school writing class has heard this stuff time and time again. At least now we understand why a number of his books have such atrocious, tacked-on endings--he never has a plot, so he's left with a lot of loose ends that are resolved in an unbelievable or stupid way. But I have to admit I have spent hours entertained by his novels.
B000003489|4.0|Giant Steps is appropriately titled as it was John Coltrane's first album made up entirely of his own songs.  The music on the album is smooth and Mr. Coltrane's sax playing is soft and inviting.  &quot;Naima&quot; is a gorgeous piece with a sweet, tender melody.  The title track is a pulsating tune.  The deluxe edition fleshes out the original album with alternative takes, but the original tracks are worth purchasing this album alone.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|You'd have to be an ogre not to like this movie.  This is one of the most delightful, visually stunning movies I've ever seen since The Wizard of Oz.  We've owned the DVD about a week now and I've watched this movie - and laughed my (behind) off - about ten times.  Buy this movie!...
B000003N8R|4.0|Crescent is probably the most overlooked recording in John Coltrane's catalog.  Released right before his landmark, A Love Supreme, Crescent was lost in that album's tidal wave wake.  Athough Crescent isn't as ambitious or groundbreaking as A Love Supreme, it contains some of the tightest work of his career.  Along with McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrsion, he floats through this set with grace and aplomb.  Mr. Jones in particular provides some outstanding work on the drums.
B00005RHGK|2.0|All the reviews I read about this movie talked about the \\"incredible beginning\\" and the \\"fresh take on the genre.\\"  Sadly, this movie was a major disappointment.  Yes, the movie seemed from the start to be worth the time.  Fifteen minutes into it, though, the whole room of us watching started our catcalls to the screen.  \\"What the heck?\\"  \\"Oh, that is SO stupid.\\" \\"Oh man, that is pathetic.\\"  And it only got worse from there.<br />Despite some truly startling moments, the movie itself descends into silly and laugh out loud scenes.  By the end - yes, we forced ourselves to watch it all - we were all checking the bottom of the screen to see if the guys from Mystery Science Theater were watching with us.  After an hour and a half of silly, you won't care what happens to anyone in the film.
B00005RZV4|5.0|Wow. is there anything better than this cd? not that i can think of. Although the cd itself is insanely good, i reccomend getting the special delux edition for the &quot;Still&quot; cd, because it's a beautiful indication of where NIN is headed. I really can't say anything about this album other than go out and buy it. Doesn't matter what it costs. It will be worth it.
B00005B4GU|3.0|As a companion piece to Kid A, Amnesiac doesn't have that album's singular, bleak vision (whether or not that makes Kid A a masterpiece or a huge downer is another question).  Radiohead insists that Amnesiac be treated as its own album and not as a grouping of cuts culled from the Kid A sessions.  Seen in that light, the album has its peaks and valleys.  The opener clicks along with seething anger, spiraling down into the wandering sadness of &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot;  After a dull interlude, the band breaks back out of its shell on &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; with a coda that makes your spine tingle.  But then Amnesiac bogs down into a creative but ultimately dull suite of songs (including &quot;Knives Out&quot;, whose piano riff is a lift of the opening guitar on &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;) lasting through an interesting but pointless rendition of &quot;Morning Bell&quot; off of Kid A.  &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; brilliantly brings back the seething anger of the opener, and Amnesiac finishes with three unique tracks that don't especially blend together.  Like Kid A, the album is admirable, but whether or not it's much fun to listen to is ultimately a different question.  What makes Radiohead such a wonderful band these days is their fearlessness and, most importantly, their passion for their craft.  That passion clearly shone through on The Bends and OK Computer.  But the isolation and ultimate lifelessness of Kid A and Amnesiac makes you wonder when the band will snap out of it.  Both albums have moments that few, if any, bands can even touch (no one else could write a song as good as &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;).  But you long for the band show more passion, even joy, in order to give you a breather once in a while.  And that's the ultimate paradox: Radiohead got where they are by listening to themselves and not their audience.  It's what makes them so fascinating.  Still, you wonder if their next album will spiral down further, or rise back up and, well,ROCK the way Radiohead can.  Amnesiac is an intriguing work, but only movies should leave you begging for more.  Ultimate listener satisfaction won't be found here.  But we'll keep our ears open...
B000050XEI|5.0|I love this CD and don't see why some of the reviews are harsh.  Enya has a refreshing style, her music is relaxing without being depressing.  My absolute favorite is tempus vernum, I love the choice of latin for that style of song.
0226264017|2.0|Probably all scientists have political biases they would like to see proven, but a persistent theme among Friedman's critics is that he is unusually willing to cut corners to prove his points. Paul Krugman writes: &quot;I think it is fair to say that up until the late 1960s Friedman and his followers, while influential, were regarded by many of their colleagues as faintly disreputable.&quot; (2) Edward Herman writes: &quot;Friedman's methodology in attempting to prove his models have set a new standard in opportunism, manipulation, and the abuse of scientific method.&quot; (3) Paul Diesing lists six tactics Friedman uses to support a pet hypothesis called &quot;Permanent Income&quot; (or PI). These are: <BR>&quot;1. If raw or adjusted data are consistent with PI, he reports them as confirmation of PI...<BR>2. If the fit with expectations is moderate, he exaggerates the fit...<BR>3. If particular data points or groups differ from the predicted regression, he invents ad hoc explanations for the divergence...<BR>4. If a whole set of data disagree with predictions, adjust them until they do agree...<BR>5. If no plausible adjustment suggests itself, reject the data as unreliable...<BR>6. If data adjustment or rejection are not feasible, express puzzlement. 'I have not been able to construct any plausible explanation for the discrepancy...'&quot; (4) <BR>Monetarism reached the peak of its popularity during the 1970s. In the 80s, however, it suffered a sudden reversal of fortune, and today economists generally agree that &quot;monetarism is dead.&quot; Friedman stands virtually alone now among top economists in his belief that it contains any merit.<br />What happened? Monetarism was tried in Great Britain during the 80s, under Margaret Thatcher, and it proved to be a disaster. For almost seven years, the Bank of England tried its best to make it work. According to monetarist theory, the British economy should have enjoyed low inflation and high stability. But in fact, itwent berserk. The economy sank into a deep recession, while lead economic indicators zigged and zagged. Although inflation came down, this was at the price of rising unemployment, which soared from 5.4 to 11.8 percent. Between 1979 and 1984, manufacturing output fell 10 percent, and manufacturing investment fell 30 percent. (5) Eventually production recovered to a respectable 2.8 percent growth, but it became clear that high unemployment was a permanent feature of the British economy. Eventually, the Bank of England came under overwhelming pressure to abandon monetarism, which it did in 1986. The experiment was such a failure that not even conservatives abroad wish to repeat it.<br />In step with Great Britain, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced in 1979 that it, too, would follow a monetarist policy. Many people blamed the double-digit inflation of the late 70s on Keynesian theory, on too much expansion of the money supply trying to achieve &quot;full employment.&quot; Many critics thought that monetarism would restore some responsibility and stability at the Fed. Chairman Paul Volcker apparently agreed, and under the name of monetarism contracted the money supply down to a steady level. This produced a deep recession, but it did cure double-digit inflation.<br />In 1982, when inflation looked defeated, the Fed suddenly abandoned monetarism and reverted to a Keynesian policy. In that summer it sharply increased the money supply, and a few months later the economy roared to life, in a recovery that would last seven years. Milton Friedman was furious at the betrayal, but he got little sympathy from his fellow economists, who were witnessing a monetarist disaster unfold in Great Britain.<br />Why did the Fed abandon monetarism? Because it was never really monetarist in the first place. Volcker's strategy to defeat double-digit inflation had been classically Keynesian: reign in the money supply, and accept a deep recession in the process. The &quot;monetarist&quot; label was simply political cover, to mollify the Fed's growing number of critics. Such criticism was not renewed after monetarism failed in Britain, and Keynesian policies produced a seven-year boom in the U.S. The contrasting experience of those two nations was responsible for the demise of Friedman's theory.<br />Endnotes:<br />1.

B000001DQG|4.0|I just wanted to take the time and explain to people what &quot;Solar Prestige A Gammon&quot; means. Elton and Bernie were fed up with critics dissecting their lyrics and all that stuff. So, they decided to write a song in some made up language that didn't make any sense at all just to tick them off. Got it?. I had to explain so people would stop saying Elton's material went downhill with that song. You gotta know what it meant before you ridicule.
0688156819|3.0|I bought this book since I'm a fan of Tim Burton's movies (Edward Scissorhands is one of the most beautiful movies I've seen). I appreciate Burton's unique drawing style, and I thought I would enjoy this book. However, it wasn't quite what I expected. I had in mind something more similar to Edward Gorey's \\"The Gashlycrumb Tinies\\" or, at worst, something akin to Angus Oblong's \\"Creepy Susie.\\" And while it does have some similarity, I found it much less entertaining. The stories are often little more than a reiteration of the title, and the verse in the longer stories strikes me as uneven in rhythm (which may not bother everyone, but i'm admittedly uptight about things like that.) One solidly redeeming feature about this book is the impeccable design, however. The hardcover edition is beautifully bound, and the book is cleverly and neatly laid out. Graphic design students might want to take note of this book solely for that feature, if it can be found cheaply.<br />In summary, I'd say the book is for hardcore Burton fans, or those who are more open to highly atypical stories. I give it three stars for effort and design.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Pink Floyd skirted the fine line between pretentious abstract pap and true grandiosity with admirable grace, inspiring legions of fans who \\"got\\" their high-concept albums or, in their altered states, at least thought they did. \\"Echoes\\" isn't necessarily for that crowd. It's more appropriate for casual Floyd admirers, like myself, who have never owned one of their records before. I found \\"Echoes\\" to be a worthy primer, compelling enough that I will definitely buy the original albums to further my education in the Floyd.<br />\\"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day\\" very aptly describes my vocation as a maker of depressingly drab yellow page ads. The long \\"Echoes\\" experience is perfect for helping pass the day away. Excruciating stretches of cosmic poppycock are nicely offset by great stand-alone songs (\\"Time,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here\\") and jarring interludes, such as Clare Torry's soulful, otherworldly wailing on \\"The Great Gig in the Sky,\\" that are magnificently transporting.<br />Purists should lighten up. \\"Echoes\\" is for Us, the converts to the Floyd fold, not Them.
6304493681|5.0|ghost in the shell is definetly the best anime movie i have ever seen...
B00004W5UA|5.0|Wow! That is all I can say about this one. This movie has so many different levels to it that after buying it 2 years ago, I am still seeing different things! I can not believe how much substances there really is to this flick and I recommend that everyone see this moive. Let's get down to it...<BR>THE GOOD: 1) GROUND BREAKING. In a time when so many movies are watered down, can anyone say Scary Movie?, it is nice to see some work that has substance. Everything about this movie is new, from camera work to the plot, this movie rocks! 2) ACTING. I knew that Edward Norton could act, but who would have thought that Brad Pitt could? I never believed in his acting ability until now. The chemistry that these two have on screen is amazing and makes for an entirely enjoyable movie. 3) PLOT. One of the most original I have seen in a long time. You will not be disappointed in this department my friends, nor will you be able to guess the ending. <BR>THE BAD: 1) VIOLENCE. Now, I am never one to not see a flick because it has a huge amount of violence (I used to watch Terminator and Predator all the time when I was young), but this one has a ton. WHile this does not turn me off, other viewers might not be able to see past this level and get to the good stuff underneith. 2) SUBSTANCE. I think that this movie should be seen by everyone, but since the substance is so graphic the younger viewers are going to have a hard time getting their hands on this one. I have to put this under the catagorie of \\"bad\\" because it seems to me like a level of censorship and I can not stand that. <BR>THE BOTTOM LINE: This moive is no ALMOST FAMOUS, but it will change your life in some way. I recommend this moive to all people, but only if you can get past the level of violence that it contains. This moive is a MUST SEE for everyone and a MUST OWN as well.
0553208845|5.0|A journey of a man who is completely open minded and receptive of this fantastic creation of God.  He seeks to test the limits of love-hate, of body-emotional-physical, of joy-sorrow (despite of his claim that he is devoid of any feeling).  He seeks knowledge and a teacher.  Siddhartha (not to be confused with Gautam Buddha) takes it upon himself to experience the pleasures (Samsara) which he was denying himself for true knowledge.  He submits self to each extreme to understand the virtues and vices of each.<br />A very grasping and enlightening piece of literature as it poses several questions in front of the reader.  This book challenges and eventually affirms many Buddhist beliefs.<br />Herman Hesse, a man who can use words and make a simple story enlightening and a spiritual journey.
B000056V73|5.0|Once in a great while there comes along a movie that everyone must see and that everyone will appreciate. This is one of those movies. With a relatively unknow cast, this movie searches every viewers soul and shines a light on what you really believe. Let's get down to it...<BR>THE GOOD: 1) PLOT. A very moving story concerning one boys seach for himself, but there is so much more behind it. Everyone who has ever listend to music will understand just what this story is trying to say. 2) ACTING. Outstanding, pure and simple. I can now see why this won so many awards the year that it came out. Every role is taken seriously by each actor and that seriousness shines through in droves. 3) MESSAGE. By this I mean what is the story trying to say. Most movies out today come in smally, neatly rapped packedges that when you are done with then they leave you with no questions about yourself. That is what entertainment is supposed to do right? Well, this movie both entertains and enlightens. Quite simply put, you will be changed by this movie. <BR>THE BAD: Nothing. I can not believe that I am actually writting nothing here. This movie does it all, every character is believeable; the story is not too sappy and moves right along; and most of all the time is just right on the whole thing. Nice job everyone!<BR>THE BOTTOM LINE: See this movie, plan and simple. When I first saw it I had to run out and buy it right away so I could watch it again. It had a profound impact upon my life and did what I said it would, change you.

B000000OQF|5.0|I am really honest that this is the best album of the Guns N' Roses firstly you can find the original members in this album and also all of theirs best performans (even Steven Adler !!) they are telling you something about their lives and hard times I am really not exaggerate that this album deserves the whole stars in our galaxy if you still haven't bought it  guees you 've missed so many cool things
B000002I77|1.0|IF you're thinking of buying this because Cobham played with Mahavishnu, you're in for a big disappointment. This has NONE of the raw energy or lighting guitar work that characterized Mahanishnu. It's slow, repetitive, mellow (ie. boring). Buy this only if you liked Mahavishnu's most mellow stuff.
B00004T37H|5.0|This animated epic really amazed me, it was edge of the seat action, eye bogglin' art, and mind fryin' plot. This is my altime favorite anime, it has amazed me over and over. The plot is a prince warrior fights a demon that was taken by the pain of an iron bullet, thus he get cursed himself, \\" First it will give you great pain, then kill you\\" (excerpt from movie) He must leave the village and find what can cure him. GREAT MOVIE!!!! Most anime's don't get alot of stars according to the \\"Famous\\" Critics, but Rogert Ebert gives it 4 and a half stars! Grand movie, it will shock you!<BR>RATED- PG-13 for animated violence/gore, images of wouneded, and some language.
B00005J6T0|5.0|I bought this cd last years and it only has 8 songs... alotho its he original recordings remastered .. it doesnt have the remixes.... I loved this cd, i bouht it for the song La Isla Bonita and live to tell. I grew up listening to live to tell since I was Born... It is one of the best ballads Madonna has ever done. Its a great song, she espally has a great voice. But you cant forget the other songs on this cd. Papa dont preach one of he big hits off this is really great, its about  a girl who gets pregrante and her fater is mad, and she want to keep her baby. I think she wrote this song because In 1985 she got pregnate twice and got an aboriton. Thats what I think.... Even thought this cd is from the 80's it never dies, madonna will always be the queen of pop and she lives on. This is a great cd by Madonna and i recomde it to everyone.
B00005OMTT|5.0|This is the long awaited compilation Enigma CD, with the most radio friendly tunes, to the most obscure but tunes that are equally deep, if not better. Micheal Cretu has musical talent which is almost underappreciated in the bubblegum pop music world today. If you want to know what Enigma is about, get this CD. Also, Enigma fans, get the accompanying DVD. you won't regret it!
B000003TA4|5.0|Ahhhhh Nirvana, whenever I flip through channels and see TRL and how stupid TeenyBoppers calling themselves rock stars, I throw in this cd (or any Nirvana CD) and it takes me back to when i was 7 years old and how I would listen to this cd till it start to feel hot and had to let it rest. Folks I recommend this cd without a doubt, harsh but beautiful lyrics and awesome guitar riffs make ... Puddle of Mudd look like .... Great Tunes such as Territorial Pissings, All Apologize, and oh of course the one that started it all Smells Like Teen Spirit. Now you have two options eithier you can ignore this review and go out and buy Puddle Of Mudd or Staind who will probably be gone by next year or you can pick up this cd and other Nirvana cds which will remain honored forever. And if your like me and are sick and tired of pop and ... it offers get this. Kurt Cobain,even though he could have been suicidal and crazy, was such a brilliant writter and and kicked pop off the charts for 4 years. Its such a shame to see what fans and music lovers turn there backs after his death and get swallowed up in the Pop trend again. Folks we need another Nirvana. FAST! Till the time comes when another will rise we'll just have to keep listening to Nirvana (Pearl Jam, SoundGarden, Weezer (OLD-SCHOOL WEEZER). GET THIS CD!
B00005R87Q|3.0|These days, a movie comes along that documents a world of people that most of the populace knows little of. Sometimes these movies are made just for the special effects, and for the directors to show the audience: \\"Look what I can do!!\\". The fast and the furious is one of those movies. There is no plot, the whole movie is a plethora of stereotypes, and the acting is just barely average. <br />BUT! what makes this movie an exciting watch are the race scenes. There was a lot of effort made in the makings of the cars, the race and the stunts that accompanied everything, and that is what probably makes you feel better about renting the DVD. If you watch \\"the making of...\\" in the Bonus materials part of the DVD, you will know what I mean. I mean, heck, after watching this movie, *I* wanted to get into one of those and drive like the devil. I recommend you watch this movie but only expect a thrill from the special effects, and not anything else.<br />ps. the absolute nay-sayers of this piece have lots of valid points, but do watch \\"the making of...\\". It just might create a little respect for the wonders that these people can achieve on film. And really, no one is forcing you to watch it twice.
B00005U122|5.0|What more can be said after the previous reviewers hit the mark. Simply if you are a Pink Floyd fan then you are also a Roger Waters fan whether you know it or not. I had the great honor of seeing Mr. Waters' first show at The Garden in NY. This DVD is a must for any fan. Since Pink Floyd has released two live recordings over the last twelve years, sadly sans Roger, it's only right and proper that Mr. Waters release a live recording of HIS music backed by a great band. I have been a big fan since '72 high school. This DVD is a true representation of the show I saw. They perform these pieces as well as his former band members did, I saw Pink Floyd in '88 and '94. Also some great work from \\"Pro & Cons\\" and \\"Amused to Death\\" etc. Thank you very much for this DVD Mr. Waters, your show was breath taking as is this DVD. Listen to the samples folks! One important thing is the way this show was filmed, no jerky jumping around that is common in todays videos. The camera focuses at the right time on each band member for a proper amount of time. Ms. Kissoon sent chills down my spine on \\"Mother\\". As mentioned by everyone else the band is just fantastic that is really what I think, oh by the way Rog is Pink. Buy this DVD an enjoy history for a lifetime. Thanks Rog and company.
B00004WG2X|3.0|A lot of people think Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennet, and that she bested Jennifer Ehle (from the A&amp;E 1995 production). I'm afraid I can't agree to that after seeing both. Although E. Garvie was good, she seemed to care too much about the opinion of others, whereas she's not supposed to be indifferent to that. On the other hand, J. Ehle illustrated brilliantly the wit and superiority of mind which are the first traits everybody notices in Elizabeth.<BR>  The best Mr. Darcy was of course Colin Firth. I don't think anybody could disagree on that subject. David Rintoul was ok, but like every other actor in that movie, he talked reaaallllyyyy fast. That's the main thing I didn't like: the actors looked like they were reciting their lines, and didn't let the time for the emotions to sink in. For example, when Elizabeth reads Mr.Darcy's letter, she doesn't react at all. Sure, we hear her thinking that it was impossible and so on...but she doesn't show the outrage she is supposed to feel, unlike in the A&amp;E production, where they dramatized that very important letter really well.<BR>   As for the rest of the actors, once again, in my opinion, they were all better in A&amp;E. Although it is true that Jane isn't prettier than Elizabeth in A&amp;E, the softness and kindness of her character really showed, and I think Susannah Harker did a great job. The only person I liked better in the BBC production is Mary Bennet. She is supposed to be silly, of course, but not resentful,as shown in the A&amp;E version. She almost shows contempt for the rest of her family, and isn't supposed to be that haughty. In the BBC version, I must admit that she is portrayed perfectly!<BR>  So although it's a perfectly acceptable dramatization of the book (which I love), I would advise everybody to go for the beautiful, and much superior, A&amp;E version. And I don't say that because of the budget difference that shows in the quality of filming in each movie (of course, the 1980 movie isn't like the Matrix or something ;) ) but because of the difference in the quality of portrayal of the events and characters!
B000001DTM|5.0|U2 is the best rock band of all time . They were good in the 80's. They were good in the 90's. They are still on top now. The highlight of their career is Achtung Baby. I think all their albums are great, but Achtung Baby just blows my mind. Everything about it is just awesome: great hard songs, like &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot;, and great soft songs like &quot;One&quot; and &quot;So Cruel&quot;. Not only is it loaded with good music, the lyrics are pure genius. This album has it all. It's received a lot of acclaim, but I still think it's under-rated.
B000002MP2|1.0|Now, I'm not one to complain normally, but I didn't find this album to be particularly great. Back in the 7th grade, when it came out, and everybody was buying, I kept my money. I changed the station every time they came on the radio. Why, you ask? BECAUSE IT'S THESE KIND OF ALBUM'S THAT SOUND GREAT THE FIRST TIME, BUT PLAYING THE SECOND TIME AROUND, YOU FEEL GYPED. This is pure, overrated hogwash. The media played \\"basket-case\\" and \\"when i come around\\" so many times I just got fed up. I basically told Green Day to \\"sod off\\" and bought Live's \\"Throwing Copper\\" instead. DON'T LET THE MEDIA TELL YOU WHAT YOU LIKE AND DON'T LIKE!  DON'T BE A CONFORMATIST B*****RD! Just, I beg of you, to explore some of the \\"underrated\\" stuff out there. You'll find something you like, just trust me.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie streches the idea of conventional cinema more than any that I have seen in a long time.  This is not a movie for those looking for a mindless series of dialogue and explosions.  This movie makes you think and in the end the reward is well worth it.  PS: If you like this movie, FIGHT CLUB is VERY highly recommended.
0201485672|5.0|This is another fabulously written book by Martin Fowler. Concepts are described in excellent detail, yet simple to understand. The first chapter alone is worth the price of the book. It not only describes numerous means of improving existing code, it abets the understanding of the full potential of the object-oriented paradigm and will significantly improve the way you write new code as well.
B00005R87Q|2.0|This film could have been decent. As it is, it's not the worst out there. But it's full of many holes. <br />Keep low expectations and it might be a mildly entertaining view.<br />** Spoiler Below **<br />My main question is why those truck drivers didn't just hit the brakes? That would have solved everything. Instead they just kept driving along while being harpooned. Things like that really bug me because any idiot could have put a better plot device in there and made it at least mildly realistic. <br />Without that and a quite a few other problems this might have been a pretty decent film.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman shoots up in the stars with the movie Mounlin Rouge. When I saw it in theaters the opening day, it took my breath away with all the fantastic coloration in the movie. McGregor and Kidman sucks you into the movie, you wouldn't want to blink throughout the movie. Love it!
B000002897|3.0|I bought this CD cause of all the praise. I'm disappointed. It's kind of bland and I can see why these guys didn't achieve superstardom. I haven't found a song on it yet with any real hook, so they come off as your average also-ran group. The first two songs are merely Ok, and after that it gets less and less interesting. Definitely recommend you borrow the CD from someone before you buy.
B00005QW5X|1.0|Before anyone blasts me, let me first say that I love Rocky Horror, I enjoy indie films, and I adore Broadway musicals...and I was prepared to love Hedwig.  While John Cameron Mitchell's performance was impressive, I didn't enjoy ANYTHING about this film.  I couldn't tell if the music was supposed to be funny or straightforward, because it was just terrible and cheesy.  I cringed during &quot;The Origin of Love,&quot; not knowing if I should laugh or hum along.  I forced myself to watch it through to the end, assuming that it would improve.  I realize that this movie garnered rave reviews from everyone from Newsweek to People, so I guess it's just me, but I can't stress enough how disappointed I was with this film.  Sorry, Hedwig!
B00003CX8J|4.0|that is, until Spiderman comes out this year.  If you are a geek about the comic series, you may not be impressed, but if you don't expect the most, you will likely enjoy this movie. :)  Check it out if only for Storm's beauty! ^_^

1558216340|5.0|I read _The_Long_Walk_ when I was in high school.  A girl friend had a copy with the front cover ripped off, and missing the first page of the first chapter.  Back then, I was the Angry Young Man you've encountered so often.  I could not stop talking about the book with anyone and everyone I met.  My admiration for Mr. Rawicz and his companions cannot be overstated.  He is a hero, a person whose endurance, integrity, decency, determination, and grace are exemplary.  He is enshrined in the hall of my heroes alongside George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Sergeant York, Dwight Eisenhower, George Patton, Mother Theresa, Mahatma Ghandi, Almanzo Wilder, Cap Garland, and any other fundamentally good, decent, and determined people you can think of.  <br />This is a must-read book.  It is possibly one of the most important stories ever told, if only because of its total honesty and utter truth, in the face of horrific circumstances.
038533348X|5.0|I've read all Vonnegut's books.  This was the first one I read, and it's still my fav.  Breakfast of Champions comes close, but this book is still his masterpiece in my mind.<br />Anyone who sees this world from the half glass empty principle will love this book.  I laughed out loud repeatedly - Kurt just cuts through the crap and writes the most basic concepts of life at point blank range - he really knows how to make us see things for what they truly are.<br />I'm not going to bore you with what I got from the book or what you're supposed to think.  I think that what makes this book great is that you'll get something out of it no matter what your belief structures are or what your background is.  Read this book and decide for yourselves.
0395951054|5.0|To berate this author's book, passing it off as simply \\"rambling,\\" is to deny passing on the message the Holocaust survivors want us most to deliver:  \\"Always remember, and never forget.\\"  To discount it as boring or confusing simply means the reader must educate himself with history, desire to learn about issues outside his own environment and current events, and most importantly - read more in order to get a better vocabulary so it won't seem so confusing.<br />Upon first hearing that Hitler was a high-school dropout and before reading Mein Kampf, I figured it was his lack of education that gave way to his feelings - and actions - on racism.  Throw in a little economic failure with a society desperate for WWI revenge, and you have the perfect recipe that needs only an uneducated schitzo like Hitler to concoct the horror that ensued.  Oh, no, indeed.  Rather, the opposite holds true:  High school was far too simple for Hitler, who, unlike our own youth, thirsted for knowledge in the subjects our youth find tedious.  It is when you WANT to learn and educate your SELF, rather than a school teacher assigning it to you that you truly learn and internalize anything.  <br />It was in Hitler's thirst for knowledge of history, culture, society and his internalization of it that he conceived applying his knowledge to an entire nation by \\"saving\\" them from destruction.  Was Hitler moral?  Not by our standards.  Was he correct?  Not by our standards.  But it is only in lending yourself to different thoughts than your own in past time periods and economies that we will learn FROM it so as to STOP it dead in its tracks in the future.  <br />The most asked questions about the Holocaust, \\"HOW could he do what he did to so many people, and WHY?\\" starts HERE, with this book.  A must read for anyone remotely interested in learning not just about Hitler, the Holocaust and Hitler's ideologies, but in responsibly educating oneself so as to possibly become a positive force in society'sfuture.  To think another \\"Hitler\\" cannot arise again is to have the attitudes and actions behind tossing this book aside, sticking one's head in the sand, and flipping on the television again so as not to miss out on one's daily vegetation into ignorance and complacency.
B00005QATY|2.0|All the hype, all the love, all the critics - Come on.  This movie was one thing, and one thing only.  Boring.  Maybe it was because it was after a long day at work when I watched this, but I couldn't really get into it - it had some wry humor, but overall, I never laughed out loud even once.  It was like watching 2 hours of a Days of Our Lives dream sequence - there was no beginning or end, just blah.<br />I prefer Homer's Odyssey.  Please Coens, keep to your own stuff.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I have to tell you that this album is one of my favorites. Howard Shore is awsome. It's Braveheart meet's Duel of the Fates. Shore's music for this great film is outstanding! And it sounds great since Leonard Rosenman's score of the cartoon wasn't that good. I love the themes and combination of orchestra and chorus in tracks 4,5. The best thing is that the CD is 71 min.long.A perfect score that always stays in my head after seeing the movie. I'm very, very pleased with this CD and you will be to. The muisc has a great RING to it.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Kate and Leopold is one of the best movies I've seen this year. I put this movie up there with Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. This is the type of movie that really speaks about what women really want. Innocence romance and true love are wonderful in this picture. I was surprized with the ending, but glad to see that the political feminist point of view was omitted. This is a story just about two people trying to find that missing piece of the puzzle without any interference with the outside, modern day world. This is a great movie to watch, especially if you like a movie without that mambo jumbo.
0060987464|4.0|I felt this book was very good indeed. however, i feel that it focused more on mansons private life, rather than his music. having said this his private life is very interesting and at times quite funny...overall a good read - buy it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This compilation blows away any other collection of songs.  The Beatles are the greatest and most influential rock band ever.  Having a collection of their number 1 singles on one album is amazing.  Songs like &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, and &quot;Help&quot; keep the listener alert and also show how the band matured.  Even though some of the Beatles best songs were not number 1's, this compilation captures the splender and magic of this timeless rock band.
B0000042H4|5.0|Dear Decca - it's time to retire those annoying side breaks imposed by the 80-min. limit of the CD format. Please release this great recording on the DVD-Audio so we can hear it the way the composer intended (it's about time).
B00005QK5X|5.0|To me, The Wipers are comparable to bands like the Velvet Underground (before they finally became famous), Love, or Big Star:  one of the greatest bands to ever plug in their amplifiers, and yet relatively unknown to the public at large.  These guys are unreal!  I profoundly regret that I never heard them live.  I almost did.  In the Winter of 1994 Nirvana was going to play the Aragon in Chicago, and the Wipers were going to open for them (the Wipers were major influences not only on Nirvana but most of the great bands to come out of the Pacific Northwest in the eighties and nineties).  I was primed and ready.  Unfortunately, the Wipers pulled out, and tragically I decided not to go to the concert.  It turned out to be the last time Nirvana played Chicago.<br />This box set collects the first three albums by the Wipers.  I have to confess that the second of these albums, YOUTH OF AMERICA, is my least favorite Wipers album.  IS THIS REAL? isn't their best, but over the years it has had more replay album than almost any other album I own.  Just one phenomenal cut after another.  But the real gem of the album is OVER THE EDGE.  It is far and away my favorite Wipers album, and one of my favorite albums period.  The title track is also my favorite Wiper cut.<br />I write &quot;The Wipers,&quot; but that is a misnomer.  &quot;The Wipers&quot; was Greg Sage, and whoever he had playing drums and bass at a particular point varied from album to album.  Sage is a decent singer, a very fine song writer, a musical visionary, and a stunning guitar player.  I think comparisons to Jimi Hendrix are absurd.  Their playing styles are strikingly different.  Sage, unlike Hendrix, very rarely plays &quot;trumpet solos&quot; (when what we think of as guitar solos were first being introduced in music, they were seen as analogs with what was being done with trumpet solos, with the emphasis on a succession of single notes), but instead focuses almost exclusively on thick, massed chords.  A Sage &quot;solo&quot; will consist of the aggregation of a large number of driving, distorted, piercing chords of maniacal force and energy.<br />These albums contain almost the first stirrings of post-punk music.  It is alternative rock over a decade before Nirvana made alternative pop.  Whatever it is, this is absolutely essential music for anyone who loves awesome rock music.  It is also essential because it is the only way to obtain the incredible album OVER THE EDGE.  A must-own.  And the bonus tracks aren't bad either.age &quot;solo&quot; will consist of the aggregation of a large number of driving, distorted, piercing chords of maniacal force and energy.  <br />These albums contain almost the first stirrings of post-punk music.

B00005QDW1|1.0|The once talented writing from Gwen has all but gone away, along with talent of the musicians that made up the No Doubt I remember.  Being a long time `East Coast' fan of No Doubt, I am dishearten at the  direction this band has decided to take with their lasted project `Rock Steady'  Instead of developing a project that would take advantage of their maturity and reflect on the experience of their talent, they have elected to put commercialism and teeny bobber mentally at the head of all else.  Just when you thought a nice guitar sole was coming, or the drive of the once - force one drummer, nope just imitation drums sounds and what guitar, that's some high paid rapper doing what he/she knows best ..nothing worth listening to.  So buy this CD if want a combo of Madonna want a be, and Juice Joe ras-ta rap man...or what ever ..-----thanks for the effort Gwen.   -On the other hand, all of No Doubt's other project are top line!!
B00005JKQX|5.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is a cinematic triumph for director Ron Howard, lead actor Russell Crowe and every member of the cast and crew that made this gem!  In the film we are introduced to the character of John Nash, a brilliant, yet reclusive mathematician.  The viewer begins to see the world from the perspective of the mathematical genius.  We follow him through his schooling to Princeton and later MIT.  There is an intriguing subplot that begins to emerge.  I will not reveal it to you, but I will say that it is very well, and suspensefully developed by director Howard and acted by Crowe and the ensemble cast.  It will shock you, but you will cheer on Nash as he triumphs in the midst of incredible adversity and learns ultimately that love is all that really matters.  This is a profound story of an exceptional human being overcoming tremendous challenges, and it is Ron Howard's BEST film yet!  The soundtrack by Howard Shore is great as well, featuring the soaring, angelic voice of Charlotte Church.  This is one of the best films of the year without a doubt!
B00003CXA6|3.0|As an extra in the movie and a high school history teacher, I guess I have a point of view different than most. From the beginning of the film (when a 400 pound Confederate sergeant who is suppose to have walked all the way from Virginia) stops someone from entering his picket line to the horrible looking ... beards of Longstreet and Jeb Stuart; there are too many inaccuracies to mention.<BR> It is true that the director (Ron Maxwell) had a limited budget; that he had to take re-enactors as extra's for the movie (which means the average age & weight were all wrong) but that doesn't excuse his use of different film for the Picket Charge scene. No one can miss that he filmed Pickett's Charge at different places and at different times of the day. The worst part of the film is the acting job of Martin Sheen as General Lee. If Lee had really behaved this way it would be a wonder that his own men didn't shoot him. It is beyond me why Maxwell allowed Lee to be portrayed as a horrible commander and as borderline senile to boot. <BR> At least the South is not portrayed as the evil slave beating stereotypes, although it is clear that the Yankees are the true hero's in this film....
B00005MP58|5.0|I've never seen a better (or more complete) adaptation of a classic novel than this version of Pride and Prejudice.  The costumes, sets, and music are all first rate.  The acting is uniformly terrific, from leads Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, all the way down to the smallest characters, such as Mr. Wickham's fellow officers.<br />I do have a criticism of the DVD, however.  I had taped the original American A&amp;E broadcast, and watched it several times over, and the DVD, thankfully, eliminates all of the annoying breaks and even includes additional snippets of scenes here and there, some of them significant.  The color and contrast, however, are very poor.  All of the lighter colors, particularly the faces of the actors and the dresses of the women, are very bright and washed out.  In contrast, the darker images are too dark.  As a result, much of the richness and the detail that I can see on my otherwise poor video is absent in the DVD.  Otherwise, however, the DVD image is clear and steady, and the sound excellent.<br />Despite this criticism of the DVD, this version of Pride and Prejudice is probably the best television production I've ever seen, and, therefore, well worth the money.
B00004RF98|4.0|Having finally decided to watch this film (which is of my parents' time frame), I was awed by the costumes, numbers &amp; its ingenuity.  Set in the heyday of silent movies &amp; about to enter the era of &quot;talkies&quot;,the movie was filled with Kelly's superb numbers (e.g. the unforgettable &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; number)&amp; O'Connor's funny antics (yet, equally admirable muscial genius).  Reynolds, with her limited exposure, was just as good with her songs &amp; tap-dance numbers. Lina Lamont, portrayed by Jean Hagen,was the funny villaniness with her hair-raising screechy voice.   Very different from the modern, high-budget films of today, the actors were not only beautiful but were very talented as well.  Such a wholesome movie.  How come we do not have this nowadays?
B0000029GA|5.0|1994. This is the year when a young cat named Nasir Jones a.k.a Nas released &quot;Illmatic&quot;. This is one of the best hiphop albuns ever made, better yet this is one of the best albuns EVER MADE IN EVERY GENRE OF MUSIC. Nas represents QBC, Queens, home of such rappers as Big Daddy Kane, Mobb Deep, MC Shan, Marley Marl, CNN, Screwball and so on...<br />I finally bought this a few days ago...I always read that &quot;Illmatic&quot; was dope, and no doubt it is...Every single song is a banga...From the intro to &quot;Ain´t Hard To Tell&quot; you don´t press the skip or fast forward buton, yet u press the rewind instead, ´cause there r several lines you listen and think &quot;What? This cat said that? Na, na, gotta listen that line again...&quot; The production is incredible, Large Professor, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, all of them gave their best.<br />The best track? Hard to say, cause it´s all good...Bu the standout tracks r &quot;N.Y State Of Mind&quot;, &quot;Halftime&quot;, &quot;Memory Lane (Sittin´In da Park)&quot; and &quot;It Ain´t Hard To Tell&quot; on which a Michael Jackson´s sample is used and by the way this was the first song I listened by Nas...And I like it a lot.<br />No doubt this album is one of the top 10 of all time, if u a hiphop fan go get it, you need &quot;Illmatic&quot; to add to your collection.
B00005K3OT|2.0|Set in the late 1950's, a gypsy woman and her young daughter literallly blow into a tiny French town to open a Chocolaterie, during the period of Lent no less. This causes problems for the town mayor and his precious townsfolk. He thinks her prescence will tempt his folk into succumbing to their sinful vices, such as erm, chocolate. Glossy, saccharine and dripping with sentimentality, this \\"chick flick\\" for the over 30's cannot even be saved by the creditable direction of Lasse Holmstrom. \\"Chocolat\\" is not an International art-house movie, it's actually as close to Hollywood feel-good sap as you can get.
B00005QB9A|5.0|You probably know Tim Roth from playing bad guys, as in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Planet of the Apes\\" --if you didn't notice, he was the bad ape--, or ,even, in \\"Vatel\\". Now, watching \\"The Legend of 1900\\", you'll be surprised seeing him playing the title role, 1900 -- yes, this is his name-- who is a very melacholic musician.<br />1900 was found in a ship when was still a baby. Adoped by one of the men who worked in it, he grew up watching people immigrate to America and being greeted by the Statue of Liberty. He is a natural born musician, so he can perfectly play piano, and it starts to call people's attention. So the film follows the life of this man who never leaves the ship. The story is told by one of his band mates.<br />The script is very fine, balacing some funny moments and some melancholics events. It is impossible to forget the impressive duel between 1900 and the father of the jazz. And Ennio Morricone's score is superb. The music that 1900 `composes' in the very moment a record is being recorded and he falls for a beautiful girl resonated in my mind for days. This piece is deeply touching. Giuseppe Tornatore is, as everybody knows, Italian and he directs the movie with the Italian approach, in other words, it will touch your heart and will make you cry many times.<br />There is no doubt that Tim Roth is the heart, soul and fingers of the film. Although he does not play piano, he just mimes, it is so good that one may think he is actually playing the songs. Other thing that is not impossible to avoid mentioning is his eyes. They are so deep and expressive. Most of his feelings are expressed by those melancholic pair of eyes. 1900 grabs your heart and, even though being so surreal, he looks so believable that you think you're watching a story very likely to have happened.<br />I recomend this movie for those who like Italian Cinema, and music as well. I don't think this is the kind of film for everyone, but, surely, it has its audience.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Tenacious D are truly the funniest comedians rocking.  Their CD is side splitting funny but also, full of superbly wonderful music.  They truly know how to rock.  Jack Black has one 'heck' of a voice.  His brother is just as good a musician.
B0000508U6|5.0|this is cd is great!!!! i bought it, when yellow came out, i was stunned to find out that the whole cd was awesome, im buying another copy of parachutes so i can have one for my car and one for my home! this cds great for a dinner date or doin your homework..if i were you..buy this cd now!!!!!!
B00005QZWJ|5.0|I love this soundtrack.  It's awesome.  I got it the day after I saw the movie, and I've been listening to it ever since.  The music is superb.  My particular favorite is \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\", a very moving piece of music.  I also liked that 99% of the track titles were chapter titles.  Except for The Prophecy, Amon Hen, and Concerning Hobbits (but that's in the prologue so it doesn't count).  And Amon Hen is a specific place mentioned.  What more can I say?  It's a superior soundtrack.
B00005RFAI|5.0|What a wonderful Christmas present I got (I asked for it, so I wasn't THAT surprised). And I honestly love nearly every song on it.<br />If Britany What's-her-face had a soul, a little more talent, and some individuality she MIGHT release a CD as good as this. OK she probably has a soul...maybe honesty is the word I was searching for. These songs crawl into your head and make a place for themselves. I find myself humming them even when I haven't listened to the CD for days! <br />And as an old 4 Non Blondes fan, I love the fact that Linda Perry is back in the biz &amp; working with someone so...FUN.<br />The Enhanced sing alongs only make the package that much sweeter. A great buy for newbies and fans alike!
B000000H4V|5.0|After the full-on speed metal of Beneath the Remains and Arise, Brazil's finest apparently thought it was time for a change of pace. This is the first &quot;experimental&quot; Sepultura album as it were. The tempos are slower and the band brought in some more interesting influences: an acoustic instrumental ('Kaiowas'), a female opera singer ('Amen') and certain passages of &quot;jungle&quot; style drumming. All of this might cause one to think that Sep had gone soft or wacky, if not for the fact that this album is full of the best, heaviest guitar riffs the band ever thought up. Several tracks, like 'Refuse/Resist', 'Slave New World' and 'Biotech is Godzilla' rank up with this group's finest work. This is a definite change from their earlier work, but in many ways just as strong. Recommended for open-minded metal fans.
B000002KIE|5.0|Many people have written about how the Sex Pistols didn;t invent punk and couldn't play. There are also remarks that they merly manipulated the media to reach their place in history. But they forget that even though they couldn't play as well as the Ramones or The Clash, they were the perfect example of what punk really is They had this absolute ATTITUDE that made them more punk than any other band before or after them. Secondly, their inprofecincy with their instraments proved how you did't have to fall for the sky or have great talent to make great music. Also, the Sex Pistols were just being themselves when they insulted almost all of Britan, they weren't putting of some sort of publicty show just to make the news. Finally BUY THIS ALBUM! and to those who diagree with me, rent or buy The Filth and the Fury(...) and you'll understand what I'm talking about.
B000002UA7|5.0|If you are looking for a gift for some one who has everything by David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, and Pink Floyd; some one who has an ear for unusual material and stylings in female vocals; or some one interested in music with a distinctly English-Irish edge, I would strongly recommend this particular recording.  Although a full box set would be required to do full justice to Kate Bush, who is certainly one of the most completely original female recording artists within recent memory, THE WHOLE STORY provides a reasonably inexpensive and good overview of her work.<br />THE WHOLE STORY includes selections from Bush's first five albums, THE KICK INSIDE, LIONHEART, NEVER FOREVER, THE DREAMING, AND HOUNDS OF LOVE.  Some of the selections, such as &quot;Hounds of Love,&quot; are obvious, but many, such as &quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;The Dreaming,&quot; are less in the line of selections typical of &quot;best of&quot; compilations than they are indicative of the diversity of her work as a whole.  THE WHOLE STORY also includes a re-recording of Bush's extremely popular 1970s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Experiment IV,&quot; which was specifically created for this release.<br />As always, Bush's remarkable voice and her ability to twist it into unexpected stylings plays sharply against the neurotic, often macabre, and frequently paranoid-toned material to remarkable effect.  I personally find the re-recording of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; equal to, although quite different from, the original, and &quot;Experiment IV&quot; is quite interesting in its lyrics, story, and its strangely almost-but-not-quite disco beat; the effect is at first a bit off-putting, but it steadily grows upon the listener.<br />There is a video companion to this release, also entitled THE WHOLE STORY, which contains videos created for releases from HOUNDS OF LOVE and &quot;Experiment IV&quot; as well as interesting (albeit less cinematically sophistocated) video &quot;restagings&quot; for earlier releases.  Although this video--like the famous 1970s KATE BUSH LIVE AT HAMMERSMITH ODEON--is out of print, it is still available  used through various venders, and is well worth a look.er releases.

B000002OAZ|5.0|This is very simply the greatest blues album in the entire universe this side of alpha centauri although, I think there's a pretty good growler near the pleides but, he fell in a black hole never to be seen again. Just get it. Oh I meant the greatest album in the entire universe period. I can tell you the likes of that! Best anywhere! I can tell you the likes of that! Oh Eric Clapton says he was TERRIFIED during the little red rooster! If you dig the blues or if you aren't sure, get your credit card #'s ready. And GO! Oh see if Muddy Waters London Sessions is available. Now I don't want to tell you how to run your home entertainment life but.........
B000007ODM|3.0|This CD is somehow similar to the previos one. However, the melody is a bit to modern for my taste. It has too much guitar and sounds sometimes like a rock concert. I recommended only if you are not into &quot;real&quot; new age music.
B000009RC2|5.0|This album absolutely made the biggest difference in the way music was concieved afterwards. In other words it effected all the musicians who heard it forever. This is not for the weak of heart. Go to Kenny G if you have any preconceptions of what music should be. Should implies guilt. This will change you and maybe erase your bad karma in just the first listen. Be NOT afraid. This is a little scary at first but, you will soon be purified and free to be decent, compassionate and self-respecting again. A small price to pay for all of this. If you never heard this or don't own it and have strong inclinations towards living, buy this disc and know there is order in the universe. We were meant to be here. Whoever called this pompous and weak was actually describing his own sex life. Soundtrack for enlightenment.
B00003CX8J|3.0|When it comes to this movie, I'm a little torn as to what my opinion should be.  On the one hand, it's a great action movie with some great casting.  On the other hand, they really messed up on the casting of certain characters (read: Storm), and the storyline for others (Rogue is supposed to start out as evil!).  Although I think David Hayter's script (and his other work as the voice of Solid Snake) are cool, there's really no denying that this is the same crap Hollywood always puts out.  Honestly, the fight scenes were really just special effects showcases, and I really would have liked to see more character development.  Hopefully, the next movie should address these issues.<br />What does this mean in terms of the DVD?  Well, the movie doesn't hold up well because of the afore mentioned issues, so unless your money is just burning away in your bank account, try to avoid buying this movie unless the film made you absolutely ecstatic.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I found this movie enjoyable and thought-provoking. As an avid oneironaught (dream-explorer), I was pleased to see a movie that provided such an interesting treatment of the subject.<br />The visual style of the movie is also quite attention-getting: it was filmed live-action and then animated (rotoscoped) using the live-action as a template of sorts. Each animator who worked on the film (and there was a whole herd of them) was able to use his or her own style. The result is a movie that constantly shifts between various styles of animation.<br />I'm waiting impatiently for the DVD to become available as this is one movie I feel is worth watching multiple times as I suspect I will still be catching new details even after several viewings!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie will put even someone having a terrible day in a good mood. It's silly and cute, not at all deep or anything.  Even though the donkey can be a bit of a drama queen (king)sometimes, the characters are generally good-tempered.  Overall, I think it's a good movie.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This sooooo beautiful that I don't know what to say. Pavarotti's Nessum Dorma is gorgeous. And every sound that comes out of Joan Sutherland melts into my heart. That explains why Prince Calaf is in love with her. Caballe also sings beautifully. Her's is a voice on the same level as Dame Joan. This is my most favorite CD.
0679746048|5.0|In 1967 18-year-old Susana Kaysen was sent to Mc Lean mental institution, after spending no more then an hour in a doctors office. At admission she was diagnosed with a psychoneurotic depressive reaction, and personality pattern disturbance. <BR>She was a high school graduate, that for threw past year had been living with her boyfriend, but that was finished when she got into the hospital.    <BR> In the hospital she made new friends, and saw and learned many different things. During her year in the mental institute she wrote a journal, which is actually the book. In her journal she tells what happens in the hospital, how they treat the patients, what they give to them, and what they do to them. She describes a lot about the way the hospital looks and where the usually like to \\"hang out.\\" There are many different people she talks about in the book, some being the doctors and nurses in the hospital, and some of them being the girls in the hospital. She tells what they do, how they behave, what the look likes, and how she feels towards them. Lisa is always speaking her mind and listens to no one. Georgina, her room maid, is like her best friend. <BR> The story is a true story and the author is the one writing about what she had gone through in life. <BR>The book has a non-chronological order that makes it so great to read. Sometimes she has flash backs about high school, and how she used to behave before going into the hospital.<BR>Many times I felt like I was right there with her because she described every thing with so much heart. <BR> I think Girl, Interrupted is an amazing book and every teenage girl should read it!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If you saw the movie.<br />You'll like this DVD even more.<br />It has so much content. I feel sorry for people who don't own a DVD Rom drive.<br />I've seen the future of DVD content. Other companies should follow Shrek's example.
078322608X|5.0|We watched (my wife and I) this movie several times. Each time we have come up with a different conclusion on &quot;What happened next&quot; after the movie ended. We never could agree. :-) This movie is intriguing and will keep you guessing on the conclusion. One of my most favorite movies.
B00003CXXP|1.0|One of the worst films of the year without question.  This film would've been raked over the coals by critics if it hadn't been for the Kubrick-Spielberg collaboration behind it.  A film full of holes and missed opportunities, there is no heart in this film and no redemption for it either.
B00005A0RI|5.0|One of the lovliest jazz recordings ever.  Smooth and serene without beeing in any way maudlin.  Highly recommended! Right at the top of all the Charlie Haden recordings I've ever heard.
B00005U18E|4.0|I have to confess that the primary reason I saw this hilarious movie was because of the casting of Colin Firth in the modernized role of Mr. Darcy inspired by the Jane Austen classic, Pride & Prejudice to which he also played the mysteriously deep Mr. Darcy. Colin Firth was well casted as the charming gentleman and hero in this romantic comedy.  Renee Zellweger was brilliant with her witty and fun characterization of Bridget Jones. I feared that as a native Texan, Renee would fail to accurately portray the tarty and tongue-tied English marm but Renee pulled the role off convincingly. Hugh Grant was perfectly cast in his role as the manipulatively charming Daniel Cleaver.  I look forward to the sequel and recommend this comedy to anyone who enjoyed the classic.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad; Poor Dad is a book that I highly recommend. It shows two different type of menatality about money. It shows that being rich is all mental then progress. And being poor is about habitation of poor people that goes to their children from the parents.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|In a film, a repeated theme gives the listener a point of familiarity. Sometimes composers have themes for certain characters or events [as in John Williams' Star Wars music].<br />The first Lord of the Rings movie has 2 or 3 of these themes, which are repeated a lot on the CD.<br />The music is terrific and the performances are wonderful, but you may get sick of hearing these themes after the 4th or 5th time!<br />I really appreciated Enya's input, though I wasn't expecting to. It fits with Howard Shore's score very well.<br />I bought the standard edition, and reading reviews of the limited version do not make me regret it.<br />One point which I have not seen mentioned in the other reviews is that Shore wrote the whole score, arrangement and orchestration included. Many film composers today would not even be capable of doing this, and those who could might well assign some of these tasks to the hacks.<br />You will most probably enjoy the music, particularly if you found it moving during the film.<br />However, be warned that many of the tracks contain the same themes, though dressed in different garb.
0062502182|4.0|&quot;The Alchemist&quot; is an international bestseller but media hype would have us believe it is a modern day fable classic. Encouraged by glowing reviews, I joined the ranks of its swelling readership only to have my raised expectations dashed. A little. Not that it isn't an enchanting little novel. It is. Only that I expected more. What it offers is old hat and lacks profoundness. The message of daring to dream and follow one's dream isn't new. The proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow - here, the treasure the boy shepard seeks in the Pyramids - is, of course, an illusion and not so different from Fitzgerald's &quot;green light across the bay&quot; that lured Gatsby to his tragic end.  The treasure we covet isn't external to us but lies within ourselves and like raw diamond, will reveal its lustre only when polished, ie it is the journey (not the arrival) that confers wisdom and maketh the man. Paul Coelho's simple unpretentious style makes &quot;The Alchemist&quot; a quick and entertaining read but it's no great shakes. I can't see what the fuss is all about.
0553573403|5.0|Having read all of the books that are now available in this series, I must recommend it as one of my favorites in the genre. The plot is dynamic and varied, and the characters shift in importance as the story progresses. Finally, a novel in which good does not always win the first round, the hero is just as liable to get knocked off as the bad guy, and the bad guy can be the hero in the next chapter. This series keeps you interested, and I must say, is one of the only series out there that I still have no idea how it will end. Buy this!
B000002VFW|5.0|Owe this one for many years. Lisa became known with it and the classic by now All Around The World is still as new.<br />Very sexy, vibrant music. If you like Lisa's singing start with this one. Sure you'll never stop thereafter.
B00000K3UR|3.0|The movie itself is really good. Its not the best movie but I still enjoyed it. Adam Sandler was a great actor in it. The little boy in the movie is so cute. The movie is really funny and is really sad. Really a VHS.
0385505833|1.0|I thought this book was ridiculous and hardly worthy of one of my favorite authors.  It is barely more than a glorified short story.  I really enjoyed A Painted House, which was a departure from the usual, and was looking forward to something perhaps similar.  What a disappointment!
B000001Y42|5.0|Ah yes, Arguably Limp Bizkit's best CD. I d realize why many people don't like it though. First of all, the CD does at times sound like a garage demo. Second, They are not used to all of Fred's screaming. He screams a heck of a lot on this CD. It'l take a listen or two to get used too, but once your over it you'll love the songs. Okay, now to individual song reviews:<br />Intro- funny as hell<BR>Pollution-5/5- Very very catchy, and has a lot of screaming.<BR>Counterfiet- 5/5- Another classic<BR>Stuck- 5/5- One of the best on the CD<BR>Nobody Loves Me- 3/5- Ok song<BR>Sour-5/5- Hands down, the best song on the CD. It really shadows of what Limp Bizkit's later classics would become.<BR>Clunk-5/5- Very catchy and cool<BR>Faith-5/5- The one that got LB famous.<BR>Stinkfinger-2/5- Catchy for a filler......<BR>Indigo Flow- 4/5-Great but short!<BR>Leech-4/5- Is this a demo? Nah! Very good<BR>Everything-3/5- Waaaay too long! It's 20 minutes long!
B00005RHGK|5.0|I've been reading alot of these reviews and it seems that alot of people did'nt like the ending. Well boohoo, the bad guy one. This was one of the most gutsy endings i've seen in along time. If you want a happy ending rent When harry met sally,otherwise SHUT UP. Of course these kids are dumb for going back and looking down the pipe. And of course there dumb for going into the pipe. If they did'nt, there would be no movie. Yes they should of just driven home but I dont want to see a movie about two kids just driving home to see there unhappy mom. Salva has pieced together a wonderful and haunting movie. It's been along time since there's been a film that just creeped me out. Maybe not since John Carpenter's Halloween. The camera angles and the score are just awesome. Salva knows how to keep the audience's attention. I think the people that didnt like this movie were the one's that just loved star wars episode one. OOOOH, now i'm getting nasty. I'm not saying this is the best horror movie of all time. I just think people are being too critical on a better than average horror movie. RELAX,dont do it. Im out.
B00000AF98|4.0|Yeah, it's slick, overproduced, and lacking a lot of typical heavy metal \\"crunch\\".  Yeah, it's got \\"80's\\" written all over it.  But for those of us who grew up in that era, it's pretty damn good.  \\"Crazy, Crazy Nights\\", \\"Reason To Live\\", and \\"Turn On The Night\\" were great ear candy, and the rest of this album ain't bad either.  Gene was criticized for bringing \\"Thief In The Night\\" (which he'd previously written for Wendy O. Williams' solo album) to the sessions for this record, but it's a great track, as is \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" (kind of understated vocals, as Gene Simmons songs go, and that makes it interesting), and \\"No No No\\" (nice Van Halenesque work by Bruce Kulick on that one).  Paul's \\"My Way\\" is pretty good too.  Only \\"Bang Bang You\\" (the \\"Love Gun\\" references are pretty weak) and \\"When Your Walls Come Down\\" sound lame here.  If you like Kiss and you like 80's rock, this is as good a place as any to start.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is one of the best DVD's I've seen to date. It's worth buying just for the screen tests alone which include actresses such as Leslie Ann Warren, Stockard Channing and Anne Archer reading for the part of Lois Lane. The cut scenes that are added back to the film are excellent. In fact, I couldn't imagine why they were ever cut, especially the Brando scenes in the beginning of the film.
B000001GBJ|4.0|A friend brought this cd back from China and played it at a dinner party. I was blown away. Incredible &amp; beautiful. Those who enjoy music from Enya, etc will truly appreciate this lovely music.  I've been recommending this cd to friends and all who have listened/purchased have thanked me for turning them onto Songs from a Secret Garden.
B00005ARDC|3.0|think<br />It's for records such as this one that self-styled music connoisseurs have coined dismissive comments like \\"over-hyped\\", \\"what's all the fuss about\\", \\"oh no, enough with the f****** BRMC\\", etc. BRMC's debut belongs to that brand of more-or-less-indie records that somehow manage to be more talked-about that your average indie release, eventually conquering a small degree of fame, even outside indie circles... In this they have much in common with the Strokes and therefore it's no wonder music snobs are reacting in the same way the did back when \\"is this it\\" hit the racks. Now, being a music snob myself I was relishing the idea of employing one of the aformentioned comments and dismiss this release as a derivative pile of pap. I was tempted but I have to admit that this is a good debut album, not great mind you, but definitely good! A couple of tracks clearly tower above the rest (\\"whatever happened to my rock 'n' roll\\" is clearly the highlight here...). The remainder of the tracks is generally good even if they don't attain the hip-shacking glory of the mentioned song. This is not cutting-edge stuff but it's a refreshing listen and people who like BRMC's obvious reference points (Jesus & Mary Chain, the Stone Roses...) may love this :-) My humble advice is to listen a couple of samples and judge for yourself...
0553381407|5.0|I used to think that we could heal without confronting, but I came to know differently.  Even if 'they' are no longer with us, we still have to confront to 'completely' heal.  Dr. Forward gives the best suggestions and guidelines I have seen as to when and how to do it so we can redefine our relationships and be healthy and happy.  This is a wonderful and definitive book about how to heal not only from toxic parents, but also from others who were abusive to us.  I recommend this book to all my clients who are recovering from toxic relationships.
B00005QHPQ|3.0|His English-language debut, 1999's &quot;Enrique,&quot; was certainly polished and entertaining.  However, there was more than a touch of overkill: the consistent handclaps, castanets, and particularly relentless acoustic guitar (plucked, of course) seemed unwilling to let you forget, even for a minute, that you were listening to Latin Pop, and the fact that Iglesias' voice had beauty and charm pretty much took a backseat to the genre.  Now that the Latin pop trend (not to mention Ricky Martin's success rate) has cooled, Enrique doesn't have to clamor for the spotlight as eagerly, so his sophomore effort, &quot;Escape,&quot; ends up an album full of a strong and unique identity.<br />Pop/rock seems to interest him the most these days; the title track is a bright and sunny workout that is all but guaranteed a heap of airplay.  &quot;Maybe&quot; is a strikingly straightforward midtempo pop song, and even dressing up beats in hints of electronica can't hide the rock and roll heart of &quot;Don't Turn Off the Lights.&quot;  And then of course, there's the song everyone's heard, &quot;Hero,&quot; an elegant pop ballad and one of those rare smash hits that actually deserves to be one.  The Spanish-influenced guitar does find its way through the door, but it's quickly counteracted by techno beats on the fetching &quot;Love to See You Cry,&quot; the lyrics of which could go one of two ways - he either has a bit of a cruel streak or he loves the girl so much, even her tears are beautiful.  <br />The production throughout the record is full of surprising little touches, be it a reverbed repeat of a vocal or a quirky hit of computerized percussion, and paired with his lovestruck lyrics, the overall impression is that Enrique just wants to have a good time.  Unfortunately some of the material doesn't inspire a party: &quot;One Night Stand&quot; and the attempted hip-hop cut &quot;She Be the One&quot; try to stir things up a bit with racy lyrics, but the melodies are so routinethey go in one ear and out the other.  &quot;I Will Survive&quot; is another song that certainly sounds commercial enough, and in the background at a restaurant or club, it certainly wouldn't offend, but when paid attention to front and center it's less inspired than most of the material it's surrounded by.  Still, the strengths outweigh the flaws, and it's impressive to see how far Iglesias has come since his last album.  Granted, radio will keep you up to your ears in at least four of these tracks for the next couple of years, but when a breezy, carefree, yet solidly distinguishable spirit is what you need to brighten your day, &quot;Escape&quot; is a good record to have onhand.
B00005OKSJ|5.0|For anyone who loves Bernstein (or even for those who don't), this is the CD to purchase.  Includes excerpts from some of his most famous stage and serious works.  <br />It has performances with some of worlds top names, original casts, and later revisions.
B00005U122|5.0|All these great reviews made me go out and get this great DVD. It is true, the video quality is the best of any concert DVD I have seen. The audio quality is right up there but still doesn't beat the open natural quality of the Ringo Starr and the All-Star's DVD which is probably the best sounding concert DVD that I have heard. Of course NOTHING (so far) beats the ELP - Brain Salad Surgery DVD-A even when experienced in &quot;lowly&quot; Dolby 5.1 The detailing of this disk is so good that it is a completely different experience from the CD version.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Anyone who thinks this movie represents even the look (much less the technical side) of real street racing obviously has never done it, been near it, and knows nothing about the laws of physics (Hint: time and space do not warp around you at 140mph, even if those jokes of cars could reach those speeds in the time they represent).  I won't even say anything about the souless and silly plot of the movie because frankly it should just be expected, when the formative idea for your movie seems to have been neon paint jobs.  Do yourself a favor, instead of watching this movie, go and buy a ticket to an amateur street race track.  There you can see real cars and real drivers, who put some heart into their vehicles and do not need special effects to help them along.  The one star is for the 69' Charger, which is certainly 2 minutes worth seeing, but I am afraid even something as beautiful as that can't save this movie.
B0000507R0|5.0|This is my favourite disk in my large collection of music DVD-V's/A's. It is just incredible and you have to hear it to believe it. Even if you just have Dolby 5.1 capability get it. It can be played at an amazingly loud volume and the sound remains clear and detailed in either format. Because it was originally recorded in Quadraphonic this piece of music was made for surround. I agree with the other reviews that say that you need good rear speakers but then who would buy a serious surround system without ensuring that all of the speakers were of the highest quality for those music occasions? There is also a considerable amount of material including some bass coming out of the center channel as well. Also the bass line in the extra Lucky Man track is just awesome. Move the good china and put your pets and children in a safe place before playing this disk.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I'm not quite sure where Shore had to go in himself to get this music, but let us all be very thankful he did go to that place.  As with the majority of Shore's scores, the tracks work more as a collective rather than as seperate cues.  Listening to this reminded me of Mozart's Requiem or perhaps some Elliot Goldenthal.  Shore clearly sees this as a tragic story, one with huge mythical overtones and Goth tendencies.  As such, this score is what some are prone to call &quot;dark&quot;.  I've been a fan of Shore's music as his work with/for David Cronenberg has produced some of the best film scores ever made (The Fly, Crash).  Here with LOTR, Shore steps into some excitingly new territory.  This is the type of music that demands full attention, so be warned...it will stir you.
B000008COG|4.0|I have absolutely no idea why 'Blow Up Your Video' has been given so many terrible reviews!  In actuality, 'BUYV' was a return to form for AC/DC.  The new tracks off of the Stephen King film \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" (1986) titled 'Who Made Who' and AC/DC's BREAK from form 'Fly On The Wall' were like nothing AC/DC had ever done before in their career.  Whether I liked or disliked the new tracks off 'Who Made Who' (the title-track plus two instrumentals \\"Chase The Ace\\" and \\"D.T.\\") is beside the point----'Blow Up Your Video' was AC/DC getting back to basics and like any AC/DC album (besides 'Flick Of The Switch' their most horrendous release of all time), all of the songs stick to a specific formula: catchy, fun, packed full of riffs and killer guitar-solos by none other than Angus Young.  There is nothing to dislike about 'Blow Up Your Video' other than the fact that the production could have used some work, and that bogs down my rating for this cd a bit to about four and a half stars.<br />The songs:  \\"That's The Way I Wanna Rock 'N' Roll\\" is a personal favorite of mine and really is a bit of a hidden AC/DC gem (actually, the entire album is! None of the stores carry 'BUYV' anymore and haven't for years).  \\"Heatseeker\\" and \\"This Means War\\" are two other essential AC/DC rockers.  All of the tracks are fun to listen to and I rarely \\"feel the need\\" to skip any of the tracks; the songs I mentioned are merely what I believe to be the standouts contained on the record (WARNING: You may disagree...... Bwahahaha!).<br />The band:  Johnson, Angus and Malcolm and Cliff are all on here; the only line-up change was with Simon Wright talking a backseat on the drum-kit.  Wright was also the same guy that joined the band to replace Phil (long-time AC/DC drummer who re-joined the gang in '95 with Ballbreaker) with 'Fly On The Wall' after he had left with 'Flick Of The Switch'.  Simon Wright, in my opinion, had much more creativity on the drums and a great deal more talent than Rudd so itis quite refreshing to hear a new guy banging on the drums for the gang.<br />Conclusion?:  AC/DC just didn't cut it with their latest, 'Stiff Upper Lip'.  The songs are so completely average that it is a pain listening to the album all the way through as there are only three or four true great songs on that album.  If you haven't bought 'Blow Up Your Video' yet, then are missing out on something.  There might be one or two songs you could do without on 'BUYV', but isn't that the case with almost every cd in your collection?  ...  If you make the decision to go ahead and discover what a great album AC/DC released back in 1988, after listening to it one time you will wonder to yourself how 'Blow Up Your Video' ever got lost in the shuffle with all their other rock masterpieces.  Keep rockin' everyone.
B000002ADT|5.0|If you have yet to have the pleasure of owning a copy<BR>of this recording, (arguably the best jazz recording ever<BR>made), and listening to it countless times, then you are fortunate to have yet another great thing in life to look forward to. &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was the second jazz recording I ever owned (after Coltrane's Giant Steps), and it is primarily the reason why I lost interest in pop and rock music after college, and began to open my ears to anything that showed signs of creativity, honesty, and virtuousity. Hard to believe that it has been almost 50 years since it was recorded.
B00005QDW1|3.0|I like all of the songs on this CD except for one minor detail; a lot of them just consist of the chorus being repeated over and over and over. Take the song &quot;Making Out&quot;--it's the same thing played about 15 times in a row. Too bad, this could have been a good CD.
1556154844|2.0|As an experienced but informally educated programmer, I'm always on the look-out for basic information I may have missed over the years.  I purchased \\"Code Complete\\" based on the Amazon reviews, which almost unanimously suggested this was a vital addition to any serious programmer's library.<br />That might have been true back in 1993, when the book was published.  In 2002, \\"Complete\\" reads like a repair manual for Connestoga wagons -- an historical curiosity, with little practical use for the modern professional.  (At least half the code examples are in Pascal; how many companies code in Pascal these days?)  Most telling is the book's brief nod to Object-Oriented Programming as an up-and-coming technique for good programming practices; a slightly more modern treatment would have *focused* on OOP, to far better effect.<br />Perhaps I'm just annoyed at wasting my money on a primer, when what I wanted was an information-dense manual.  However, if you're in 4th grade and learning BASIC, \\"Code Complete\\" might actually help to improve your marks a level or two.
B000002UB3|5.0|&quot;...(The Beatles) will keep progressing, they'll make better music and they'll never fall. Only, in thirty years, I don't they'll have meant as much as Elvis Presley.&quot; (from 'Pop From The Beginning' by Nik Cohn, pub. 1969)<br />Don't you find it funny?<br />I think it's hilerious.<br />Mr. Cohn's prphecies, I might add, were far from accurate in other areas as well; in the same book he predicts that both the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd were going to break up any day now. Ironically, though, The Beatles' 1969 release, named simply after the studio in which it was recorded, showed no signs of the Beatles ever breaking up, even though in reality they were already finished. In 1970, when their penultimate album, 'Let It Be', and the accompanying film would both be released, it would be quite clear that it was all over.<br />'Let It Be', it's quite obvious, was a very bad move. The frictions within the band were bad enough as it was; bringing in cameras into the studio made things much more tense, as the movie plainly showed, and eventually brought the inevitable end faster. However, following this bitter album, the bandmates decided to record one last album, to end the Beatles on a happier note. It works. All of them knowing perfectly well that it was going to be their last, the Beatles did their best to have fun recording this album, and the result was a fun, energetic, happy album, with none of the moodiness that characterized 'Let It Be'. On 'Abbey Road' everybody was at their creative best, most notably the forgotten Beatles - Ringo Starr and George Harrison, both of whom reached their peak on this album, Ringo with 'Octopus's Garden', clearly his best composition and a very fun song, and George with 'Something' and 'Here Comes The Sun', both of them absolutely gorgeous and of his finest songs.<br />The main stars, of course, are as always Lennon and McCartney, who put their differences aside for a while (as John put his Yoko aside for a while) to createthe wonderful second half of this album, which is basically a medley of both finished and unfinished songs. Because the songs are so short the entire album is given speed and energy that makes it a wonderful listen. The songs on the medley, though none of them stands out as a masterpiece, are mostly excellent: John supplies 'Because', 'Sun King', 'Mean Mr. Mustard' and 'Polythene Pam', Paul contributes 'You Never Give Me Your Money', 'She Came In Through The Batheoom Window', 'Golden Slumbers' and 'Carry That Weight'. All of them except for that last one are fantastic songs. John's fantastic 'Come Together', originally written as a campaign song for Timothy Leary when he was running for the senate, is also a classic, as is his long, ecstatic screamer 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)'. Paul's 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' is another favorite of mine, with light poppy music and beautifuly grotesque lyrics, sarcastic black humor that is rarely present in Paul's music.<br />Then there's the ending, of course: 'The End', one of my favorite Beatles tracks, a fast, rhytmic mostly instrumental piece in which every bandmate was given one instrumental solo. George, of course, shines the most, but Paul with his heavily distorted low solo does fantastically as well, and also Ringo, who was generally opposed to drum solos, supplies here the only drum solo of his career, and it's much better than could be expected. The entire track is extremely powerful and energetic, as the solos build onto each other, when finally the whole thing breaks down into no more than a quiet piano, with Paul singing those eternal words: 'And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.' A wonderful song, and an appropriate farewell from the Beatles. Or at least it would have been, if it wasn't for 'Her Majesty', a fast, quiet 20 seconds long song which was added at the end of 'Abbey Road', giving the album the wink that has always been the charm of the Beatles.<br />Well, what can I say...? Iconsider all of the Beatles' albums to be absolutely essential, but the least you can do is get the top five, and this is certainly one of them (I dare not attempt to label any of them as being better or worse than the others. The other four are, in my opinion, 'Sgt. Pepper', 'Rubber Soul', 'Revolver' and 'The Beatles'('the white album')). Many people consider 'Abbey Road' their best; I don't quite agree with that, but it's a superb album, a lot of fun, certainly more accessible than the white album or Revolver. It's one of the Beatles' best, and their best group effort since 'Rubber Soul' in 1965. 'Let It Be' may have been the last album for the public to hear, but thank god 'Abbey Road' was the last made.
B00005QB9A|5.0|I Picked this DVD up because I am a big fan of director Giuseppe Tornatore ( Cinema Paradiso, Malena ). Five minutes into it I knew I was in for treat. Tim Roth stars as &quot;1900&quot;, an abandoned infant who is raised on a steam ship and never sets food on dry land. His whole world exists only with the passengers and co-workers. Soon  his talent as a piano player becomes legendary which forces a showdown with the great Jelly Roll Martin ( Played by Clarence Williams III ). The jazz soundtrack done by Tornatore's frequent collaborator Ennio Morrocone alone is worth the price of admission. All in all this movie is a real gem.
0767830555|3.0|I'm in the middle of those who say it is terrible and those who say it is a masterpiece.  Certainly, 25 years of movies and (I assume) imitation can make it seem less of an impact film.  But it is very slow.  It has only one dramatic moment (the climax).  The character is inexplicable many times.  The script is so minimal that I sometimes wanted to yell- \\"say your line already!!\\"  <BR>Of course DeNiro is good but I don't see the part as one of his most demanding.  <BR>But Cybil Shepard is drop dead gorgeous!!

B000002J03|5.0|Zep is the greatest rock band ever. People who try to discredit Zep for stealing from Black American artists... well.. yeah, they were heavily influenced, but Zep is Zep. Some will say listen to Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and say they stole Muddy Water's \\"You Need Love\\", but really they are just trying to show how 'smart' they are. Really, the music isn't even CLOSE... and the melody... not close... just a little bit of the lyric is the same, and the vocal melody is much different, though you can hear the influence. Anyways... you also have to factor in things like production. Zep rocks, and they are totally original, all powerful, and timeless. Get their entire catalog. And go check out Muddy Waters via your fav Napster P2P client. Hear for yourself.
B00005JKQX|3.0|Sorry, but while great film has the responsibility for excellence in script, direction, acting and cinematography, when it lies by selective ommissions from truth, it is propoganda, not art.<BR>Biographer SYLVIA NASAR has defended screenwriter AKIVA<BR>GOLDSMAN's decision to omit certain details about mathematician JOHNFORBES NASH from his film A BEAUTIFUL MIND. <BR>Fans of the GOLDEN GLOBE-winning writer's biography about the former schizophrenic have criticized both Goldsman and the movie's director RON HOWARD for ignoring significant aspects of Nash's life - including his homosexual tendencies, that he fathered an illegitimate child and that he and his wife ALICIA divorced shortly after his schizophrenia was diagnosed.<BR>In the film, JENNIFER CONNELLY, who plays Alicia, stands by her troubled husband's side throughout his mental problems, and Nash, played by RUSSELL CROWE, is portrayed as an upstanding and resolutely heterosexual man.<BR>Sorry folks, but without truth there's no beauty when beauty proports to be truth and not fantasy. .
B00005K3LU|5.0|This is probably the epitome of what an action movie ought to be.  All action movies after this were modeled after Die Hard. It's true. The formula: Terrorist takes over (place), one hero is there with them who has to save the day. How many times have you seen that? Probably more than just a couple of times if you watch a lot of action movies. Not that all those movies were bad, but they can't hope to live up to the original thing. This movie had it all, great dialogue, a great script, great actors, great special effects, and the perfect combination of action with comedy. This is arguably Bruce Willis' best character ever. His banter with head terrorist Hans Gruber is at times hilarious, at times adrenaline pumping, his conversations with Sergeant Powell are inciteful and interesting, and him just talking to himself are all great parts of this film that add to the story. <BR>The DVD of this movie fills all expectations of what a great DVD should be and then some! I haven't watched all of them, there's so many! First off, the extra scene, Turning off the Power, isn't that great. It just shows a little more of the terrorists turning the power off. The Scene Editing thing, as many reviewers have said already, is absolutely awesome! You get to play around with scenes, changing camera angles, editing the sound, etc... You'll be playing around with this thing alone for days! It includes the full screenplay, which is cool for people like me who have an interest in writing. It of course has all kinds of trailers and TV spots, and it has about three commentary tracks. One of them that I haven't tried yet is supposed to be in subtitle form instead of audio. As I said, I haven't tried it yet, but it seems like a cool thing because that way the sound of the movie isn't interrupted while the commentary is running. This is what all DVD's should be like!!!  <BR>Anyway, if you haven't seen this before, rent it this weekend and watch it with some friends. I give you my personal guarantee that you will enjoy it.

B00000BKI4|4.0|Mercury Rev are soon to play an \\"18+ only\\" show in my area, exactly one week before I turn 18.  No, life's never fair.  But at least, for consolation, I still have this wonderful album to listen to.  <br /><br />I used to have this problem with this CD.  It went like this.  I would need to do some homework, and I would put Deserter's Songs on as background music.  But before I could get started on the work, I would be drawn in by the haunting strings at the beginning of \\"Holes\\".  I would sit still, waiting for that magic moment when Jonathan Donahue's voice comes in for the first time.  I'd be sitting there staring into space, thinking about how the music sounded like rich dark colors, crimson and sea-blue, and what does he mean when he says \\"Holes, dug by little moles, angry jealous spies, got telephones for eyes\\"?  Then--oh, the song is over.  Time to get some work done.  <br /><br />But then \\"Tonite it Shows\\" comes on.  I try to work, but mostly I'm kind of staring through the page.  I'm concentrating on the lovely changes in the melody.  Track 3--\\"Endlessly\\".  Hmm, interesting-of all the songs with vocals, this is the only one without any water imagery.  But it does mention ships, so maybe that counts.  This isn't the best song, I think, but it's very pretty.  Jonathan really does have a beautiful voice.  I smile dreamily.<br /><br />OK.  This next track is an instrumental--\\"I Collect Coins\\".  Now I can get some work done.  But my concentration keeps on wandering to the fact that \\"Opus 40\\" is about to start.  And the instrumental is short.  And then \\"Opus 40\\" does start, and I fall over in a panic attack of amazement.  Since when is music allowed to be this good?<br /><br />The guitarist Grasshopper takes over lead vocals on the next track, and it's a nice change.  His voice isn't as unique as Jonathan's, but it's good in its own way.  Once again, it is impossible to concentrate.  Interesting lyrics here--I'm fond of the line \\"Mercury is falling, yeah who forgotto pray?\\"<br /><br />Another instrumental, during which I stare continuously at the same paragraph, debating whether I should really try to read it.  But before I can come to a conclusion...oh yes...\\"Goddess on a Hiway\\" begins.<br /><br />If you've heard this track, then you understand.  If you haven't, I'm telling you that the album is worth it just for this song.  Reading the line \\"And I know, it ain't gonna last\\" on paper will never be a substitute for hearing the melody that goes with it.  Oh, the power.<br /><br />You'd think I'd manage to get a little work done, now that the album's best track is over.  Wrong.  Because they follow it up with \\"The Funny Bird\\", a mysterious, atmospheric song with filtered vocals and a storm-at-sea feel.  Sometimes I think this song is even better than the preceding one.  The first few seconds are incredible--a couple of quick ascending notes on the keyboard, simple and unadorned, suddenly crash into a huge ocean-like wash of sound that remains for the rest of the song. Good stuff.<br /><br />\\"The Funny Bird\\" leads into \\"Pick Up If You're There\\", one of the best instrumental songs I've ever heard, and that includes the works of Mogwai, Tortoise, et al. With an extremely sad mood, it's actually just as expressive as the songs with vocals.  I chew the pencil as my mind conjures gray-blue images of a dark, lonely house by an ocean.<br /><br />The last song, \\"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp\\", would be okay to do homework by, if it weren't for the fact that it's so darn good and it's kind of happy for a change and I want to dance around the room.  Instead, I settle for just sitting there grinning, thinking, \\"I love this album.\\"  I haven't gotten any homework done, and that's okay, man.  Mercury Rev exists, and all is right in the world.  Yeah.<br /><br />Now, I've just been describing my reactions during the first few weeks of owning this album.  I should also mention that this was nearly my very first exposure to what is often known as indie music (I credit Mercury Rev for permanently altering the direction of my musical tastes, away from the likes of Coldplay, toward the underground and obscure).  At the time I'd never heard anything like it, so naturally, it had to seem amazingly good.  But, naivete aside, this is still a very strong album, in my opinion.  Bear in mind that your individual results may vary.  <br /><br />I've had the CD for several months now, so the initial thrill has worn off somewhat--as it does for all music.  Nowadays, of course, I don't die of astonishment every time I hear it, and I've discovered that, besides being excellent music for close listening, it really is very good background music, once you're used to the songs.  But I still love the album, yes.  It has aged well.  It still elicits strong reactions from me.  I'm giving it four stars because 1) five stars is reserved for a classic on the level of Modest Mouse's The Moon and Antarctica; 2) I don't want to add to the hype more than necessary; and 3) I'd like it to be a little more...substantial.  The first two instrumentals are kind of throwaway, and if it was cut down to just the 5 or 6 best songs, you'd have a really killer EP.  But I'm nitpicking.  Deserter's Songs is great.  Check it out.  It'll do you good.
0060934913|4.0|How Bourdain manages to be so thoroughly lively, exhausted, lurid, touching, affectionate, foul, informative, downright silly, and loving between two mere little book covers was beyond me at first, but I got the point as I settled into this fine fun read. Books rarely make me laugh out loud, and this one did. Books also rarely offend me with the kinds of foul language and images he at times invokes, and this one did. Or did it? I just cheerfully plunged on, as fascinated as I once would have been getting stoned with a total stranger who then keeps me hanging on until dawn to hear every word of his frquently grubby and despairing life story. \\"I want more\\", I whined as I turned the last page and saw the sun coming up. Not too much non-fiction does that to me.<br />It's a rough story about line cooks in not always the finer restaurants, as we all know, and what goes on in a variety of those kitchens. That's the read one is told one is going to get, and one is neither disappointed nor particularly shocked. One learns a lotta kewl and nasty stuff about these places, and gets some great offhand expert tips for home cooking and eating out. But it's lot more than that as one thinks about it - this gestalt is elusive, and more than a sum of its parts. That's because it's about, at bottom, FOOD, our daily mystery and joy.<br />As a home cook, I made some notes (altho I already use his plastic squeezy bottles for sauces, being a vintage 40's an 50's kitchen stuff collector) from his tips chapter. I've been waiting for YEARS for somebody to recommend the right cheap knives, and here they are ! And as a person who likes a good but not fancy restaurant meal (fresh ingredients and simplicity being my bag too), I made mental notes on good days for fish, for avoiding brunches from now own (except my own), for skipping certain dishes on buffets, forever. It was nice to see this scattering of direct pragmatic information in the midst of such a wild ride. It gave me a chance to breathefor a bit before diving into the next adventure.<br />What hangs this all together, this mixed bag of tales and tricks and cussing and laughs, is the guy's love of food, its character, its handling, its consumption, and the business of preparing it in what amounts to a balletic zoo of bizaare creatures from planet Mongo. The book is steeped because he is steeped - THIS is an expert, not a gossip columnist. Everywhere he is in this thing, except in his reminiscenses of his first two childhood food loves in France and the ensuing youthful rampage thru all the food types he could get his hands on (this chapter borders on the poetic at times and is slower than the rest of the book, and should be), he is dashing on, already planning the timing and plating of his next chapter. It all leaves one breathless, delighted, impatient to read on, and equally intrigued by the next course. <br />His mellower later years introduction to this reprint is nifty. So was unexpectedly encountering him on the Food Network one evening while I was reading the book - talk about double vision !! He was exploring food in Cambodia with his buddy from Les Halles, and having a fine old time (altho his gastroenterologist was mentioned at one point, laughingly and with resignation). <br />He must be one heck of a cook.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I look upon &quot;Beatles 1&quot; as an excellent Beatles collection for those being introduced to the Beatles (no pun intended) for the first time. My advice is if you like what you hear on this CD, then start buying the original British albums. On &quot;Beatles 1&quot; you hear the band musically progress from &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, to &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, etc, etc...<BR>Yes, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Now go check out the rest of the Beatles catalog, you won't be dissapointed!
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I really wanted to like this film. After seeing it, I'm astonished it made Official Selection at Cannes. On the bright side, the art direction is very good. I love the colors, typography and some of the special effects... to an extent. The storyline is so riduculous that it comes across as late-show camp. The film's downside is enhanced by unlikeable characters and pathetic overacting. What is especially irritating though are the song and dance numbers. Mixing pop music with a peroid drama is an interesting idea but executed, it just doesn't work.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Anime with a complete and complex beautiful story, no annoying long humor sequences, no tons of reverb, I could go on and on.<br />This movie should set an example for all the cookie cutter, lone rogue vs. the bad guys anime movies out there!
B00004TH7Z|3.0|Let's face it, this CD does not even come close to the power, sophistication and imagination of The Number of The Beast, Piece Of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, and Seventh Son CDs. Even the original Iron Maiden and Killers CDs were superior to this. Iron Maiden used to sing about cool things involving end of the world senarios i.e. 2 Minutes To Midnight, Die With Your Boots on, etc. They also were king at instrumentals like Phantom Of The Opera, Genghis Kahn, and Losfer Words. Such greats that were taken from mythology and history like Alexander The Great and Rhyme Of The Ancient Mariner were show stoppers. I will admit that this CD is better than \\"Fear Of The Dark\\" and \\"No Prayer.\\" When I 1st heard \\"Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter\\" I just about wet myself laughing. My band had turned into a former shell of the band I knew.  I know that Bring your Daughter to the Slaughter became number one in Europe, but most of us in the U.S. knew that Iron Maiden had gone down the tubes.  I went to the Brave New World concert with high expectations and was very disappointed.  I saw the Piece of Mind, Powerslave and Somewhere in Time concerts and everyone of those shows blew my mind and forever changed the way I feel about music.  I am definitey one of their biggest fans, but I will not call this a great album just because it's Iron Maiden we are talking about.  I sure hope their next album is better.  I am not looking for Maiden to release a clone of past albums, but to use some of the creative energy that they had when they created their pre-1988 CDs.  Brave New World gets two and a half stars, just because of the fact that it was better than No Prayer and Fear of the Dark.  I know the European fans just love this CD as well as No Prayer, Fear of the Dark and The Blaze albums, but it just doesn't cut it in America.  Compare Live After Death to A Real Live One and A Real Dead One and you will see what I mean. Enough said.
B00005QDW5|1.0|I'm not a big Pink Floyd lover but liked them enough to be interested in a Best Of CD.  So I bought it without paying much attention to the track listing because we all know what SHOULD be included in a Pink Floyd Best Of, right?  Needless to say, I should have read the track list more carefully.  If you are like most people, you will be disappointed.  How can you have a Pink Floyd Best Of without Dark Side of the Moon?  Are we to believe the weak 80's and 90's tracks on here are really better than some of their classics?  I feel... off.

B00003CX9E|5.0|To all those people that say the people that like it are basically brainwashed and don't know how to think for themselves all I can say is don't lash out at people who like it if you don't get it.  Go to your dumbed down \\"Pearl Harbors\\" and whatever it is you watch and let us movie buffs enjoy.<br />No, it's not the best movie ever (I've seen better) but it is definitely a technical achievement and an excellent story that unravels.<br />This DVD contains an excellent transfer and great extras (though the documentary is slightly disappointing).  A must for fans and film buffs (not Michael Bay followers).
B00004BZ16|5.0|I first bought it in 1982, and have never grown tired of it.  There is so much depth to it.  Yes, it's a sprawling, stylistically ambitious (overambitious?) album, but that is part of its genius.  It was a great leap forward for the best band of its generation.  Some of the best songs on here are ones that will not jump out and grab you on first listen, but that sink their hooks into you slowly: &quot;Something About England,&quot; &quot;Street Parade,&quot; &quot;Junkie Slip,&quot; &quot;The Leader.&quot;  But it's all good.  It's true: they were the only band that mattered, and they just don't make 'em like this anymore.  Well, not quite: please check out the two discs by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros . . .
B00004U45G|4.0|Before this album, I'd already written off the Black Crowes as nothing more than a band that would be amazing if they just stuck to covers, instead of relying on ham-handed Stones/Zep re-hashes.  Say what you like, the critics were never pissed off at the BCs because they were influenced by the Stones, they were pissed off because there really wasn't a shred of originality or uniqueness in their delivery.<br />As for Jimmy Page, we all know the (mostly) rotten fruits he's reaped since the demise of Zeppelin.  And at his age, he can't possibly be expected to live up to his own past, so he doesn't try.  Backed by the Crowes however, he can pick his spots and still relatively shine.<br />As a result, the album is great fun, with particular emphasis placed on the second CD, which (from start to finish) is loaded with energy, updated riffs, and--let's face it--wistful memories.  From the blues covers, to the Zep b-sides (wise choice), the result is one of the best live albums of the 90s.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This was one of the best films I have seen in ages. It isn't the standard slasher film that so often fills up the Horror genre. <BR>    It is extremly spooky and suspensful in places. It can invoke the same kind of feelings of watching a horror film as a kid. This film is all about sitting around with your friends, turning the lights down and saying &quot; Don't go into the room.&quot;<BR>    it was alot of fun and apart from a couple of cheesy events I enjoyed it alot.
B00005NYKT|4.0|After picking up 'Faithless' last album \\"Outrospective\\", I saw Dido being featured in one of the tunes, and figured it was respectibility by association.<br />So where does it lie?  Dido has a great voice--a combination of Sinead and Harriet Wheeler--and most of the tunes carry themselves sheerly based on that fact.  Good thing too, because the lyrics are mediocre at best.<br />The album loses steam about 8 songs in, which in this day and age, isn't too bad, but the 4th star in my four-star rating goes for the bonus CD, which contains reasonably interesting (for a change) remixes and (on my Korean copy) one unreleased track.<br />The bonus CD however, doesn't excuse the high price of the import.
0385505833|3.0|I have not read more than 1 or 2 John Grisham books so it wasn't his writing that drew me to this.  It was that this book had stayed as #1 on the best seller list for so long.  After reading it, I think the reason the book spent so long on that list was due to the author name, not the book itself.  It was an easy little read - never really challenging the reader's thought process, an appropriate book for sitting in the waiting room of your local dentist's office.  I do believe if this story had been submitted by an unknown author, it probably would have been returned with a rejection note stating - &quot;nice little story - plot line needs more development&quot;.<br />I fully expect to see this whole story in some made-for-TV Christmas special starring Dan Akroyd by the end of 2002.  So, if you are looking for a relatively quick escape from reality and just want to read what amounts to a sit-com in a book, enjoy, relax and have at it (or wait for the TV special)!
B000051VWW|5.0|I didn't get this CD when it first came out. I guess because I was waiting for Columbia House to get it because I am very cheap. Anyway, when I did finally see Sade in concert I knew that I had to get this CD. I agree that some of the songs are not like LOVE DELUXE or DIAMOND LIFE but Sade did an excellent job and since she sold 3 million copies of Lovers Rock.....that proves that somebody must have liked it. The CD is definately worth getting...From \\"By Your Side\\" to \\"Slave Song\\"  to \\"Flow\\" (which is my favorite) This CD does not miss a beat. The best song on the whole CD is \\"Somebody already Broke My Heart\\" It reminds me of the old Sade. Anyone who is wondering about this Cd doesn't have to wonder anymore. It is the absolute best CD in a longggg time. If you are sick of all this BUBBLE POP MUSIC then you should buy this CD and enjoy.
B00005NW02|5.0|This CD, simply put, is a fantastic album. It is one of the few CDs ever put out by anyone (like Linkin Park) in which I like every single song. Every song is so original, funny, and no two songs sound alike. The first song I ever heard by SOAD was Chop Suey, and from then, I was hooked! I took a gamble on buying the album, and am in now way dissapointed, it was worth every penny! To put it in a better way, there are 14 songs on the CD, the best ones are: Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Jet Pilot, X, Chop Suey!, Bounce, Forest, ATWA, Science, Shimmy, Toxicity, Psycho, and Aerials, you do the math! Buy this CD!

6304924216|5.0|This is a very clever movie. What if you looked in the mirror in the morning and saw your worst enemy staring back at you? John Woo's clever action film takes a sci-fi concept and uses it to tell a very personal story. Face Off is about an FBI agent, played partly by John Travolta (convincing in a serious action role) and partly by Nicholas Cage (again very effective in a tough part). The effects and technology used to achieve the body swap are impressive, but they are really incidental .<br />What makes the movie, and where Woo and the cast show their skill are the huge action set pieces juxtaposed with moments of intimacy. The death of Archer's son at the hands of Troy is particularly well handled, being moving without being maudlin. Care is taken over every shot and the editing makes this even more effective. It's well worth buying becasuse you can watch it again and again and pick up more and more each time.
0446608955|5.0|Not all of us in this world have fallen in love, nor do we know what it's like to be in love. Yet, some people like Nicholas Sparks have the eminent gift to be able to describe love to us in such an extraordinary way that makes our heart hungry for this marvelous feeling.<BR> During the year of 1958 at Beaufort, North Carolina a touching story about love at a young age, unfolds. Landon at age seventeen thought that he'd gone through a long journey in life. But, the day destiny deals him a bad hand, his life completely rotates; he falls in love with Jamie Sullivan. In simple and common words the \\"school geek\\", whom he had known all of his life, but had never paid enough attention to notice her inner beauty.<BR> The magic of how Landon with the rush of time is attracted to Jamie more and more, but fools himself by not accepting it, keeps you glued to this splendid story. What if this lovely realistic-fiction novel actually took place? I would get us startled, wouldn't it? Not for the fact that the \\"school geek\\" and the \\"popular guy\\" fell in love. But, for the fact that two people found within each other what most people spend their lives seeking, mutual love.<BR> Read \\"A Walk to Remember\\" and experience all the different kinds of feelings Nicholas Sparks wakens up from your heart. Love is another world apart, and the only way to know about is by exploring it. Stories like this one though, show and prove to us now love is and if you want to see it with your own eyes I recommend reading \\"A Walk to Remember\\".

B0000541VS|2.0|Sleepers purports to tell the story of a group of boys who, growing up in Hell's Kitchen in NYC, straddle the line between good and evil, and are thrown over the line after their brutal stay at an up-state reform school. Sharing an oath while still young to never disclose the cruelties they've endured, especially sexual brutalization at the hands of a group of guards led by the sadistic Nokes (Kevin Bacon), the group grows into scarred and withdrawn men. With their juvenile records sealed, their inner pain is the only sign of their suffering. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) goes to work for the New York Post, and unsurprisingly becomes the narrator for this tale of woe. Two of the other boys aren't so lucky, becoming coke-addicted Westies-like contract killers, doomed to die before they hit 30. In an inexplicable coincidence, the pair happen across the hapless Nokes in a Manhattan eatery, and extract a cruel revenge. .... In a lucky turn, the subsequent murder prosecution is handed to Michael (Brad Pitt), an ADA and the fourth of the unlucky boys. In a bid to enhance the revenge they all want, Michael plots to throw the trial, revealing Noke's uncharted history as a sexual predator to do the defense attorney's job of raising reasonable doubt. Because some of the prosecution's witnesses were also former reformatory guards, the defense has an opportunity to discredit them and reveal their sins. Those not exposed on the stand are tagged by other contract killers, whether related to our heroes or to other boys brutalized at the reformatory. Besides covering the trial, Lorenzo's job is to protect Michael from retaliation for heading the prosecution against his former friends. As the trial progresses, Michael and Lorenzo are forced to break their oath and reveal what they endured to Father Bobby (Robert De Niro) and Carol Martinez (Minnie Driver playing latina), a local girl and single mother loved by each of the four boys.<br />Despite the premise, Sleepers loses it for me. The great pains the film takes to jar your senses and convince you of its authenticity makes the flick look shallow and manipulative. The script bathes itself in an underworld cool of local gangsters and dark secrets that looks very Hollywood, and Lorenzo' voice-overs don' help. \\"It was 98 degrees on the day our lives changed forever\\" gives you some clue as to the New York Post style realism that pervades the film and undermines its credibility (Carccaterra's position with the New York Post seems about the only credible thing in this movie). The courtroom looks like some unconvincing Hollywood set (probably the reason why the film requires a screaming subway to cut across now and then). What really kills me is the shallow and high-minded moralism of the film, with characters like Fat Mancho pontificating about justice-for-sale, and ignoring the top-flight cast (with matching paychecks) the movie leans on heavily. De Niro and Hoffman are totally wasted here. As a father I can't easily ignore the cries of victimized children, but I found this film's slickness an insultingly manipulative vehicle for dealing with that horror.
0553208845|4.0|I was given Siddhartha as a gift from a close friend.  At first, I didn't know what to make of the book.  Having memories of H.S. English class and struggling through Steppenwolf, I must admit I wasn't very optimistic.  However, I am very fond of this book - Hesse's insightful words provoke new perspectives on life -- how the negative, painful situations we sometimes face are what actually allow us to fully experience the positive.  Although some of the religious references  challenged my concentration, Hesse keeps the reader occupied with his emotional descriptions of Siddhartha's thoughts and learnings as he struggles to find inner peace....Nirvana.  If you're looking for a light read that will help you bring more clarity to your own &quot;meaning of life&quot;, I would recommend this book
B000002HD5|5.0|This is the greatest disc I have ever been privileged to hear. Each song is better than the last , with 'What jail is like\\" currently my favorite (though that may change) . Everything about this record, from the disturbing lyrics,  the discomfiting soundscape , to the way certain songs segue and themes and verses recur throughout make this a supremely chilling disc. Ignore all of the horrid thrash and other ... bands trying to pass themselves off as evil or demonic.Then  Whigs come across as infinitely more sinister and chilling, especially when one recognizes snippets of themselves in the words. If ever there were a disc designed to be listened to after a bitter breakup , this is it . I have actually gone through a few copies , wearing them out form repeated listenings . The cover is ideal . Every one I have asked has a differnet view of what the cover means.Vagueness is just one of the things expertly expressed in this. I recommend this to any neophytes .Just don't hold me responsible for anything you discover about yourself.
B000059HCN|4.0|Well, I guess Amazon's Jeff Shannon would call me a masochist, because I did watch this film two nights in a row. Of all the recent drug-themed movies (\\"Blow,\\" \\"Traffic,\\" \\"Jesus' Son\\"), this is probably the most powerful. It is also the most adventurous cinematically, as well as being the most effectively cautionary of all these cautionary tales. <br />Several viewers below noted how stunned they were by the cinematography, the editing and the top-notch acting. I certainly had expected a well-acted film--the cast alone would suggest that. Ellen Burstyn's has garnered a good deal of well-deserved acclaim. And I knew that Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans were up and coming young actors--who basically needed a plum role or two to really jump start their careers. Well, they certainly got a chance to strut their collective stuff in this release, and I hope they're able to capitalize on the film's artistic success.<br />But I have to admit, I was unprepared for the film's powerful contemporary feel. The old fashioned 50s style title (evocative of such films as \\"Hatful of Rain\\" and the \\"The Man With the Golden Arm\\") had me fooled. The startling camera work, the jump editing, the stark soundtrack (courtesy of the Kronos Quartet) were anything but old fashioned. In lesser hands, it might have risked cliche --but director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Hubert Selby Jr. have all avoided the trap of sheer avant-garderie by emphasizing the human element over mere style. A haunting, ultimately devastating film.
0060926317|1.0|This book is poorly written and obviously fiction.  There are so many holes in it that it should be swiss cheese.  I had to make myself finish it so that at my Book Club I could atleast say I finished it before I tore it apart.  Though it may have a small bit of merit as a \\"new age\\" inspirational, it comes off as silly and poorly thought out.  I never once believed that this happened.  I was so glad that it wasn't longer because I couldn't have taken another page. I don't understand all the reviews of \\"who cares if it is true or not\\".  If a writer wants to get a message out, it can be done well without faking an experience. I was grateful for all the negative reviews that gave specific examples of the flaws from the book and regarding the author.  She should be embarrassed! I was embarrassed to read it! Leave it on the shelf where it belongs.
0553106635|2.0|I would rate the previous volumes in this series very highly, and while this one has its moments ultimately it's a dissapointment.  It feels as though Martin lost his way and couldn't work out what to do with his characters so ends up killing off a large number in the last hundred or so pages, or leaving them in limbo.  I don't understand why the Danerys thread was in there if she never gets to actually challenge for the throne!  The whole valar morgulis thread of arys' story (which I loved) never went anywhere either.  And who was the black rider with cold hands who rescued Sam?  Another intriguing sub-plot (well the whole book feels like subplots) that disappears. It feels like their should be a fourth volume to explain everything properly.  Much of the first half of the book is gripping, but definitely loses its way in the second half.  In the end just too many characters and plots which never came together.
B00005U122|5.0|This is another Must-Have dvd to be one of the Floydians and a fan of Roger Waters. Otherwise, don't count yourself as one. Roger Waters and the band have created an amazing performance with wonderful audience. The sound and the picture quality is splendid. If you love PINK FLOYD and ROGER WATERS,and a ROCK-MUSIC lover, this s an INDISPENSIBLE concert dvd to be watched over and over again.  You can't realize how fast time passes with Jacky on the rocks beside you. STANLEY KUBRICK's contribution to 'Perfect Sense' has made the song awesome. Hall's begging mercy to Dave on the background sound has put the put the bricks on the wall finally. 'What God Wants' could've added more flavors in the concert. I'm sure we all Roger Lovers will meet in the Garden one day. Fly high...

B0000009RX|5.0|This album is perhaps one of the best comedy albums I've ever heard.  The songs really capture the lighter side of a time period, whether it's talking about &quot;places where phony hippies meet&quot; or cops killing &quot;creeps....pow, pow, pow.&quot;  Some of it seems a little overboard (such as &quot;Let's Make the Water Turn Black&quot; but this is a great recording.  Perhaps the best part is the total lack of any attempt to seperate the songs.  There are no fade outs, no blank space.  One track will literally end in mid-sentence and leap into the next, and they are laden with true 60's-style psychadelic feedback and such.  A lot of fun, especially for fans of the Beatles et al. who need a swift kick in the pants!
630420065X|5.0|\\"Mission Impossible\\" is probably one of the best spy films I've seen in a long time! Different from James Bond 007 movies, \\"Mission Impossible\\" has a clever plot, lots of twists and turns, edge-of-your seat suspense, some parts where there is witty humor, and action which would satisfy any movie lover!<br />Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is sent on a mission with other IMF agents Jim Phelps (John Voight), his wife Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas), Jack Harmen (Emilio Estevez), and Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite). It's a fairly simple job in Prague, their mission is to keep surveillance on the top-secret NOC list. But everything goes wrong as the list in stolen and one by one, all of the agents are killed, leaving only Ethan alive. He then learns that the list that was stolen was actually fake, and that the whole thing was a set-up to capture a 'mole'. And since Ethan was the only one left alive, he is now the prime suspect for being the traitor. Now disavowed with a man-hunt going on for him, Ethan must find out who the real culprit is and to do that, he plans on stealing the real NOC list to bait him! With help from Claire who had not really been killed and two other disavowed agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), they now have a 'mission impossible', to catch the traitor!<br />This is certainly a 5 star movie since it has what I think all the ingredients that are needed in a good action movie: acting, plot, action, suspense, and a bit of humor. And \\"Mission Impossible\\" has it all! But probably the two ingredients which were the most well used was the superbly written plot and the action. <br />The plot was pretty original, not the usual 'an evil man/group planning to take over the world' plot, but one where agents all over the world would be in danger if the NOC list isn't kept safe. Also there was plenty of mystery, surprises, and twists and turns, making the watcher actually having to think during the movie. You would actually have to watch \\"Mission Impossible\\" a few times to get the whole story.<br />As for the action, probably the highlights of the film are most probably the beginning where the agents are keeping surveillance on the NOC list, the breaking into the CIA computer vault, and the helicopter/train scene. My personal favorite is the breaking into the safe in the CIA safe, it was a really exciting part!<br />There was a sequel made after this movie, \\"Mission Impossible 2\\". Returning in the movie are of course Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. Though it was very exciting and more action packed, the plot was very, very simple compared to the first movie and also it had a different director, John Woo, direct. All in all, an OK movie which I recommend to watch. And of course, all James Bond movies are must-sees.

0451457994|4.0|This novel is solid, however a little disappointing. A like the destination of Saturn over Jupiter, as the magnificence of the rings, and the depcription of Japetus, make it very awe-inspiring to read. However, I feel that clarke does too much to desctibe the monolith as the creation of physical beings, and looses much of the ominous mysteriousness which made the movie so great, when he actually descirbes the &quot;creatures&quot; process of evolutoin, etc. But overall, this book does a fantastic job of portraying the unimaginable vastness of the universe, the overarching prupose behind its creation.
B000002LOE|4.0|When you turn on your CD player, pop in &quot;Out of Time,&quot; the first thing you are greeted with is a rap-pop miture called &quot;Radio Song&quot; that sounds extremely dated today.  At the risk of being cliche, &quot;that is SOOO 90's!&quot;  Still, it would be silly to say this is not a good album, and certainly critics and listers agree; this was released during REM's peak.  Virtually all the songs are at least listenable, and some are very interesting, such as the song &quot;Belong,&quot; which I feel gives a hint as to the music REM would produce on later albums.  It's slow, introspective, and very mood-oriented.  Of course, most everyone likes the radio hits (&quot;Losing My Religion,&quot; and the mildly silly &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;).  Overall, this album is a fun listen, but I prefer music that actually makes me sit and think, and this album doesn't do it anywhere near as well as REM's indie days, or their later work.  Sometimes being popular can be a disadvantage, since everyone has probably already heard several of the songs on here, and unfortunately those tend to outshine the rest of the album, making it sort of a redundant purchase since you can hear the best songs on the radio every few days anyway.
B000002KBU|5.0|Like another reviewer, I too was exposed to Mitchell through a VH-1 program. It sounds strange, but it really was musical love at first sight, and my appreciation has grown deeper in the almost two years since I bought it. <br />Soon after buying this album, I spent a month on a boat in the middle of nowhere and every night after finishing the chores I would go sit on the deck and look up at the stars and listen to this album from beginning to end. It's something I would look forward to throughout the day, and I cannot think of a better  album to go with such a special time in my life. <br />Each song is a distillation of hard-won experience, and it amazes me that some years of living plus hours of writing plus weeks if not months of recording can equal something that still stands after all those hours are gone. <br />Do yourself a favor, listen to this album. Maybe it will speak to you, maybe it won't. But if it does speak to you, I can guarantee you will be listening to it for years to come.
0446608955|5.0|Although i only started to read this becuase I like ot read the books before I see the movies, this was a book I could not put down. The characters of Jamie and Landon jsut came alive. This book is about Jamie, an old minister's daughter, who doesn't fit in,but is the sweetest perosn you could find. and Landon, a so-called bad-boy who is not sure what his life is really about. Though strange circumstances they end up together in the school play, and become very close. Everything is wonderful, until Jamie reveals her secret. I tihnk this would have to be the first book I have really cried at. Tjis is a wonderful book and I urge you to read it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a perfect melding of the White Album, Husker Du and Mission of Burma.  This CD unites what the '60s and the '80s alternative has strived to be: perfect pop, perfect edge, perfectly brilliant. Yet, this is NOT derivative.  As a mid-30s former punk rocker who saw U2 on their &quot;Boy&quot; tour-not to mention Ultravox and New Order (who Radiohead also borrow from), I can attest that this is one of the BEST bands I have EVER seen live and that they have made their own contribution to rock and roll. It is rare that you get such a beautiful, emotive voice combined with amazing songwriting.
B000056K04|5.0|Of all the albums i have listenend to this, it has to be said just blew me away. this album is although not very well known im so sure that it will soon top the charts. Im proud of the fact that i have listend to this album.<br />please take my word for it and try this album out you wont be disapointed for the best laid back jazz/rock sound so my fellow music lovers keep [the space between ]
B00005ASOC|3.0|Kind of slow....  But, it was an interesting story. I can't say that it is a remarkable or memorable film, just interesting. <br />Connery, as usual, brings the film to life. He plays his character expertly.<br />It is worth the watch.
B00003CWNR|1.0|A beautifully filmed but only adequately-acted movie oozing with pro-choice and maudlin romantic sentiments.  Rightfully overlooked at the Oscars.  Epitomizes most of the over-rated junk that has come out of Hollywood in the last four or so years, starting with Titanic, and including such melodramatic misguided claptrap as American Beauty, The Green Mile, Magnolia, and Wonder Boys.  <br />This film is definitely a junker.
B000001IPL|5.0|This breakout album by these guys was a refresing listen from the day it came out back in 1994.  As opposed to the grunge that was still dominating rock back then, this album was downright catchy and fun to listen to.  Sure, plenty of \\"angry\\" messages prevail, but it is done in an uptempo and often humorous manner.  Finally, a band from the first half of the '90s that doesn't take itself too seriously.<br />To the tracks:  \\"Self Esteem\\" is one of my favorite rock tracks from the '90s.  Funny and kick-a** at the same time.  Among the many great lines in this song, how can you go wrong with lyrics like \\"the more you suffer, the more it shows you really care\\"?  \\"Come Out And Play\\" was another awesome hit--rocking and catchy, yet serious in its message about street violence.  \\"Bad Habit\\", \\"Genocide\\", and \\"Not The One\\" are among the other tracks that keep up the powerful non-stop pace of this album.  Especially later in the album, the tracks get really short, but all are very fast-paced.  Sure this may be \\"selling out\\" from a punk-rocker's perspective, but for the mainstream rock listening audience this is a heavy delight to listen to.
B000021Y77|4.0|Run Lola Run is sort of like a work of art, as far as movies go. The movie has three separate storylines. I myself, think that this movie would be better with only one, but oh well...that's not the way it is. Lola is sexy in a strange kind of way with her red hair and everything. This movie is worth owning just to look at Lola! This movie would be better too if it wasnt so badly dubbed in English. All in all it is a good movie and I recommend it for anyones collection. The soundtrack is good as well.
B000001DVV|4.0|This album was a non-serious breath of fresh air that came out right as grunge was taking over the rock universe in the early '90s.  How can you not get a kick out of a track like the rocking leadoff track \\"Neighbor\\" with lines like \\"My kid's a punk, and I'm a drunk\\"?  Nothing to be taken seriously here, as in their big hit \\"Everything About You\\"--as in \\"I hate everything about you.\\"  Funny stuff for sure.  For a more serious track, the remake of \\"Cats In The Cradle\\" is a nice ballad (although I'm sure purists who love the original hate it).  Besides these three radio hits, tracks like \\"Goddamn Devil\\" and \\"I'll Keep Tryin'\\" really rock, and \\"Mr. Recordman\\" is a nice, somewhat mellow track to end the album.  Overall, the album is pretty heavy with not many ballads.  If these guys had come on the scene a few years earlier, they definitely would have had a longer, more successful career.  They just arrived on the scene with this style of music at the wrong time.
B000002LND|5.0|Just look at the track listing... every single one of these tracks was a single and on the charts for weeks. The tracks go from upbeat dance tracks to more sanguine melodies. Madonna has a unique voice and and beat... no two songs sound quite the same, but they are all screaming \\"Madonna!\\"<br />I went on a road trip with a friend a few months ago and this was one of the CDs we brought with us... we ended up listening to this CD over and over again at least 5 times... and we sang along with each song, did the hand movements on \\"Vogue\\" and we just had a blast. I didn't realize  the words to so many Madonna songs.
B000051S3H|5.0|I first saw this version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" in Europe when I was 14. That evening marked my transition from child to romantic teenager. I never saw it again for 23 years until I bought the VHS last year. It is the only video I own. I watched the video 10 times now and can't get enough of it. Today I copied John Williams' theme from the Internet to my hard drive, and keep listening to it. I never knew Williams could compose something that doesn't sound like Gustav Holtz' \\"Jupiter.\\" Awesomely beautiful... George C. Scott is the definitive Rochester, Susannah York is excellent, because she manages the fine balance of being vulnerable in love yet strong in her convictions. But I must admit, having read the book again last week, that some scenes could have better conformed to the original scenes without adding too much in length. For example, the \\"no reproach\\" scene where Scott holds back too much, not getting up from the armchair; and the final scene, again Scott holding back too much or trying to be too subtle. I always felt that he played like he's bursting in that final shot, but when compared to the book, bursting alone won't do. Pity, because you can't rewind the time and re-do this version. Still, I'll never be able to bear looking at another Rochester. (Have seen each version but Dalton's once and never again.)
B000001ES4|5.0|&quot;White Stones&quot; is my first exposure to Secret Garden. Like always, I was curious and bought this cd. What a gorgeous album! I found the music to be quite moving. While there are no lyrics or lush vocals to be found on this album, the music itself speaks volumes to the human soul. The closest I could compare this music to is Loreena McKennitt, minus her gorgeous vocals. New age, classical and celtic music is fused together to give the listener a gorgeous soundscape of the best of both worlds without overwhelming the listener. I can hear the passion that Fionnuala Sherry puts into her violin. That really shows and I don't say that very often about any given musician nowadays. I think in order to show your enthusiasm for your music, you have to be enthusiastic about it and I hear that in Fionnuala's music. And of course I can't forget about Rolf Lovland. His piano playing is breathtaking to say the very least. After hearing &quot;White Stones&quot; I am certainly intrigued by this duo and will have to look into their other albums they have released.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|the way this movie is filmed is fairly unique; the action sequences are running backwards in time while the telephone conversations of the lead character, Leonard (Guy Pearce) moves forward. the parallel time streams were presented well and the phone conversations are shot in black and white to help ingrain the timing distinction.<br />however, this movie is a mystery at its core -- a logic puzzle and there are several things that makes the premise unbelieveable. the primary problem is why Leonard is able to run around given that he was connected (victim or not, the degree depends on your interpretation of the film -- but probably a victim if you analyze the tattoos) with one or more homicide. given his condition, it's difficult not to either be released to his closest kin, or be committed... either of which would have prompted a search of a missing, potentially derranged, and dangerous, person.<br />given his condition, i can't imagine him eluding any kind of manhunt -- he is just so easily remembered. it's also difficult to believe Natalie (Moss) wouldn't turn him in for either revenge for Jimmy or to tie up a loose end with Dodd. there's no reason Dodd wouldn't turn Leonard in (even as an anonymous tip) -- well, maybe not Natalie or Dodd per se but others like them that Leonard's probably met in the past.<br />for a guy that's so disciplined (to the point of tattooing instructions), Leonard also seem to rarely keep a pen on his person... that's not a short term memory problem, that's logically irresponsible.<br />finally, it's really reaching that a cop would use such a loose cannon like Leonard, who takes polariod 'momentos' and accumlates so much circumstantial evidence of everyone.<br />if, however, you sit back and don't think about the film from a logical starting point... it's not a bad movie with some credible acting and otherwise good direction.
B00005U122|5.0|OK, you have to like Pink Floyd in order to like this DVD, but the overall production is great, the music sounds terrific,its a fact that Roger does not sing as much as he used to but backups are great and the rendition of Comfortably Numb is the icing on the cake.<br />Highpoint: The special feature movie about the concert's rehearsal. Thats my major interest in a music DVD. Behind the scenes stuff and this one has it.
B00005JKES|5.0|I now have the pilot and the First Season on DVD and I couldn't be happier with it. How people can find something to be upset over is beyond me...especially one reviewer's gripe that they don't have a widescreen option!?!? It's a TV show, it was filmed for TV not a movie screen. If you're a fan, you'll love this set.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I think it is sad that these people writing these reviews are so mad and critical about a movie that was created for the sole purpose of portraying an underground car club.  Have you ever heard of FICTION?????   It's an interesting concept where people ignore their dismal, ordinary lives and actually try to enjoy a movie about fast cars and hot women.  I know that it's hard to do this when you are driving a primer-spotted metro, but seriously, where has the sense of adventure and imagination gone.  If you ever had the experience to drive a car like the ones in this movie, you wouldn'd know what do do.  You have to respect the workmanship that went into these cars and the imagination that went into the customization of them.  I happen to know from experience that a modified fuel injected V6 or 4-cylinder can outrun most carbourated V8's.  To the reference about the V8's doing wheelies, it's a combination of rear-wheel drive and POWER.  Please don't criticize things that you know NOTHING about!
B00001NFCY|4.0|when i bought this cd i was VERY impressed. i have had this cd awhile and i still love it. this cd is clean and awesome! here is my personal ratings on all of the songs on the cd in order.<br />#1.Are You Ready?- This is a very heavy rock song and is one of the best on the cd. it gets a 9/10<br />#2.What If- THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE CD AND ONE OF THE BEST THAT THEY HAVE EVER WRITTEN! it is very heavy. 11/10<br />#3.Beautiful- it is a little softer but still is very good 9/10<br />#4.Say I- another heavy rock song and one of the best on the cd. 10/10<br />#5.Wrong Way- This is softer but i still like it. it respectively gets 8/10<br />#6.Faceless Man- this is softer to but comes in with 9/10<br />#7.Never Die- it is softer to but this one still gets 7/10<br />#8.With Arms Wide Open- if you don't already know this song is awesome you should it is softer because it talks about his baby but gets 10/10<br />#9.Higher- This is one of my personal favorites this song is a heavy rock song 10/10<br />#10.Wash Away Those Years- this is soft and talks about the death of his grandmother. 6/10<br />#11.Inside Us All-this is a softer song 6/10
B000007T1M|5.0|Listen to this once and only 3 songs are good, twice and 5 songs are good three times and it'll take you a year to take it out of your cd changer.  The riffs and crazy and serj has got the best voice in metal by far.  The energy is all over the place.  One second you are listening w/ your head bobbing and your eyes shut peacefully and then in a split second you'll want to jump around and go crazy.  If you like music, then buy this album because I cant say enough about it.
B00000K19E|4.0|The matrix is an effective and interesting film. The reason for this is that it is succesful at two levels. The first level is that it creates an artificial world which it gradually explains. This world is based on an original view of the future and is a plausable basis for an action film. The second level is that this is an effective action adventure film set in that world. The dialogue is effective for an action film and not embarrasing. The plot is taunt and gets you in.<br />The roles are all played well and both Keanu Reeves and the female lead are great. The action scenes are tremendous and you can watch them again and again. <br />This film will no doubt have a number of follow ups and make the cast and director a lot of money. This they richly deserve.
0880389052|5.0|Re-reading Homeland after the first time five years ago brought back much memories.  Undoubtedly, some of Salvatore's best works were in his earlier periods.<br />When the book came out, Drizzt was already a familiar character to to readers of FR novels, having been introduced in the Icewind Dale Trilogy - Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver and The Halfling's Gem.  His combat skills with the twin scimitars were already well documented, as well as his faithful friend the magical panther Guenhwyar.<br />In Homeland, Salvatore attempted to explain the origins of how a drow, traditionally enemy of the surface world, came to be a defender of the weak and upholding justice in the realms.  He began with societal description of Menzoberranzan, a mighty drow city where Drizzt's natural family resided as one of the stronger noble clans.  Through a combination of macro and micro view of interaction between the drow clans, Salvatore depicted a society where the strongest rule, not only among families, but also within.<br />Born to a world dedicated to Lloth the Spider Queen, where everything is permissible (except being caught) to further personal benefit, Salvatore showed how a unique combination circumstances shielded the young drow noble was shielded from the despoiling influence of his society until he was sufficiently strengthened physically and emotionally to face the stark truths of everything around him.<br />Throughout the theme, Salvatore dictated a furious pace of the progress of the young Drizzt through his formative years, learning his place as a page, a warrior trainee and a student in the drow academy where inter-student rivalries were literally deadly, before Drizzt finally took his place as a fully fledged male noble in his clan.<br />At intervals, there would be a page or two of personal contemplation of Drizzt on his Menzoberranzan years, the lessons he learned, and re-learned upon the benefits of hindsights. These musings serve as an interesting read to readers, allowing them to bring their own mullings to pace with Drizzt's developments.  This, is one of the better parts of the book, which overall is an excellent piece of reading.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Well, that sorta makes sense!<br />For me this is a {hopefully} unconscious tribute to the French movie &quot;Eyes without a Face&quot; - just substitute the crazed plastic surgeon for our demonic friend, stepping lightly behind Clive Barker.  Yep, it's kind of THAT territory complete with bickering siblings who like Miss Red Riding Hood take a shortcut to Hellville, and meeting quite a few Grandmamas and, err other Things along the way.<br />Victor Salva who previously brought us &quot;Powder&quot; seems to have a penchant for the downtrodden and the abused  -  this is an interesting talent worth watching!<br />Expertly lit, acted [well, the kids do do justice to the script!], and directed, we see just enough of our demonic friend, who just might be a long lost close cousin of the original &quot;Thing&quot;, except this babe [now, IS male or female?????] seems to have a heart - or a few hearts, err lungs, and other things humans need.<br />Not, too long either - just right for a few muffled screams!<br />Double bill it with &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot; - nice!
B00005RHGL|4.0|First off this is a great improvement over the orginal bare bones dvd, But I wish there would have been a few more features the second disc was not really necceserry it would have all fit on one disc. The featuretees were nice and intreasting but two of them were only seven minutes and the other one just over twelve minutes. My mom enjoyed the newspaper artcile although i found it difficuilt to read, i wish they would have reproduced it on paper intead of on the dvd.The storyboard of the o.k corral was nice and the interactive timeline informative. There is also a nice booklet and map included with set. the dvdrom game works unlike tombraider and sherk and is quite fun. There is easter egg if you scrooll right on the dvd rom icon a star will appear click on it and you will get a nice still gallery of artwork and poster conncepts. People this is probbally going to be the best tombstone dvd you can get, so if you are a fan of the movie buy this but dont expect a moulin rogue type of bonus feature disc you wont find it here.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I love this CD- the music is wonderful, and I must admit I bought it for the Hero song, but now I have several other favorties as well.  It reminds me of music from the 80's in a contemporary way, that I can relate too.  You won't regret this purchase!
B00003CXB2|5.0|This review won't help anybody. This is just the greatest movie of all times.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I recieved this as a birthday gift.  I love these kind of silly movies.  I thought that Ms. Witherspoon nailed the part.  As far as silly comedies goes, this ranked over my previous fave, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.  I like movies that entertain and make you laugh without thinking too much.  I really enjoyed it and so did my husband who normally doesn't enjoy these kind of movies.
6303402348|4.0|1/25/02 Tom Hanks' acting in Forest Grump leaves the impression that he didn't insist on \\"the player being the thing' vs the 'play being the thing'(it's nice seeing movies where you remember the plot,first,than,which actors  help make the movie interesting)...The movie billboard as well as the video jacket give no clue that the movie will go beyond the \\"minimal deminsional\\" of a \\"bus stop\\" or \\"park\\"  bench...Hank's character is not stupid,he's just missing certain abilities of intuitiveness...an emotion which is not inheritant,but usually evoles in us as we get beyond our tottler use and go on beginning with the age of reason\\"( about the age of 6 or 7). It has nothing to do with moral or immoral,ethical or unethical,kind or unkind...There are court cases at present where the defendant's lawyer is trying to prove his client is disfunctunal and didn't quite understand the damages due his doings .The movie,  Forest Gump has Gump, narrator ,on a park bench ,recounting (to many a  non-requesting \\"ear\\")the places in his life in which \\"from ordinary people\\" to \\"legends\\", he plays a role... In my opinion, the movie needed all those extras to keep our attention.His role, as not greatly dimensional, needs those actors,those cameo roles, that music and someone like actor Tom Hanks, who while playing the main character, still, allowing you to see all those 'bad sights and sites of the last several decades through your intuitive eyes not those of \\" Forest Gump\\". (he never truly is inside..somehow he is a parody,whose never being made aware due to more applaude  than rudenesses that he is a parody(e.g. his scenes with Pres. Kennedy & Johnson). He has not agenda outside of those to whom he's made promises..however he is a 'rote' person who is lucky enough to do whatever he does well..and is rewarded as such (the irony is ,he could care less about so much hoopla over his doing whatever he does in an impressive way..he's not doing it because he has an agenda,he does it because he'sbeen told what he's expected to do and he's missing that part of us that says \\"why?,who? what? where? how?).In real life few ,with his condition have that much \\"luck\\".
6305265666|4.0|I think this movie is so cute and so good.  I love that it is like the original Cinderalla story but in a way it is not.  I love Drew in this movie.  She is so sweet and it was like the role was made for her.  But I do think that it is a chick flick.  My finance did not think it was that great but I loved it.  So I would suggest women to see it.
B000001FFJ|5.0|When I run across fellow Tom Waits admirers, it seems we frequently find ourselves in the \\"Pre-Swordfishtrombones\\" camp or the \\"Post-Swordfishtrombones\\" camp. The Pre folks love his love ballads and bluesy works like \\"Martha\\" and \\"Spare Parts,\\" while the Post folks appreciate his artistic and experimental works that seemed to really kick in with the above-mentioned work.<br />I'm one of the Pre-Folks. I dig the melodic Waits, his humorous tunes and love songs. That said, I found \\"Rain Dogs\\" to be an incredible meeting of the experimental Waits and the traditional Waits.<br /> \\"Rain Dogs\\" followed Swordfishtrombones, and I was told by friends to expect similar work. I was pleasantly surprised from the start; The opening song \\"Singapore\\" sets the stage for a fabulous CD packed full of music with an artsy edge to it. While the romantic songs are quality traditional Waits, the tunes that steal the show are ones like \\"Singapore,\\" \\"Diamonds and Gold,\\" and \\"Cemetary Polka\\" which are eerie works of storytelling as only Waits can do. This might sound like a stretch, but if a master storyteller like Robert Louis Stevenson were required to spin a \\"Treasure Island\\" style tale into a short haunting song instead of a novel, the result could be something along the lines of these tunes! <br />I especially enjoy the lyrics in the opening tune where new sailors are welcomed to the night boat headed for Singapore: \\"Wipe him down with gasoline/ til his arms are hard and mean/ from now on boys, this iron boat's your home.\\" Add Waits' gravel voice with the clunky instrumentals, you get a very cool and haunting tune!<br />I wouldn't go as far to say this is my favorite Tom Waits album, but if you are becoming an avid fan, I believe that \\"Rain Dogs\\" is an essential addition to your collection.
B00004S35Z|5.0|Having read the review at Allmusic.com, I did expect a great album, but I did not think it would be this great! The review gave it 4.5 stars. The other album review I read at the same time was Innervisions. Innervisions is a good album, but not quite as great as FFF in my opinion. Living For The City may be an epic, but I think You Haven't Done Nothin' is much more heartfelt.The most beautiful song on FFF is probably To Shy To Say (he knows how so many of us feel) and that beats any of the ballads from Innervisions. Don't get me wrong, I gave Innervisions 5 stars in my review. I just think this is better. I will add though that it is not as perfect as Talking Book and as epic as Songs In The Key Of Life, but it is truly a gem.
0930289528|5.0|this a book is a nothing short of a master piece buy this you'll really like \\"Yes, I know my enemies they're the teachers that taught me to fight me: compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission, ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite.

079070546X|5.0|I think that this is an absolute must have in a DVD library.  You just have to watch this at Christmas, or any other time of the year.  Just another silly movie that I love.
B00005NB0H|1.0|Gosh, when will the NEXT reissue of this album be out? Why they couldn't just put it all out at once is beyond me. I'm not made of money, Petey!
B0000029GA|5.0|i believe in my own opinion<BR>that nas was ine of the best in da game.<BR>And stil is one of the best in da game<BR>lyrically ,he is untouchable.
0671027344|5.0|this book will remind you of those days when you were once what seemed like the outcast. what is was to be young and the memories that come with it....some good some bad.....but definately memories you don't forget. i loved this book...
B00004S367|4.0|I was weighing up whether to give this five stars or four. I had reviewed all of Stevie albums from the 70s (except Secret Life of Plants because I haven't heard it and Songs in the Key of Life because that review will take some time since that album is so great) and given them 5 stars each. Is Music of My Mind a contender of Stevie's greatest album. Possibly. But with the opposition, Music seems to be lost. Talking Book, Fulfilliness First Finale and Songs In The Key of Life are better than Music of My Mind. However raw Music of My Mind is, I felt it was better than Innervisions. To be fair to Innervisions, it is a classic so I gave it 5 stars. To be fair to his other albums, I had to give it 4 stars. Favourite cuts would have to be I Love Every Little Thing You Do, Love Having You Around and Evil
6304508611|5.0|Comming from a 13 year old, I absolutely loved it,I really think Sissy Spacek was a wonderful part in this movie. I saw past the looks and I actually really think she was really beutiful, call me blind but I really hate the end, It made feel so bad, This movie was filmed in my hometown, her House was in my town but unfortunatly they tore it down, damn it!
0446608955|5.0|For Christmas break, my English teacher made us read a book. Thinking of what I should pick, I remembered some of my friends discussing a book they read and liked a lot. The book they were talking about was called A Walk To Remember by Nicholas Sparks. As I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I will admit that I don't like to read that much, and when I start reading a book, I usually never finish it. This was completely different, we had 3 weeks to read the book, and I read it in 1 week!<BR>   I am a 14-year-old girl, and like other girls, we all want to fall in love. (Grown ups would say puppy love). This book is a really sweet and cute love story that will capture your heart.<BR>   One of the main characters is Landon Carter; he is in his senior year in high school. Landon thinks that his year will be the same as other, joking around with friends and chilling around all the time but he is totally wrong. His life, and thoughts about life will change right after he picks drama as one of his classes. Thinking he will be able to sleep in this class, he goes not imagining what will happen.<BR>   Jamie Sulviani is also in her senior year. She is not like other girls in school; Jamie is the daughter of the Minister in town. She is always carrying a bible with her and she is consider as the class dork. Also in drama class, Jamie is picked for one of the leading roles in this year's Christmas play. Jamies father, Revender Sulviani, writes these plays. Jamie wants this play to be one of the best plays ever presented. She wants this for her father.  Actually she wants this year to be the greatest year in her life. She wants to help the orphanage even more this year. She wants to give each little kid a Christmas present they have never received before.<BR>   With no other choice, Landon invites Jamie to the Homecoming Dance. Jamie will accept to go, as long as Landon keeps his promise of not falling in love with her. (Landon promises). A twist in fate, makes Landon break his promise. He falls in love, but will it be forever? <BR>   In my opinion, the author wrote his memorable book in a way that teaches you a lot about life, and about the fact that you don't have to criticize someone without even knowing him/her. I loved this book a whole lot, and I wouldn't be surprise if you did too.
B000002U82|2.0|...until I heard it.  This was about 15 years ago and it was just sitting there in his extensive (read: he'll never miss it) CD collection -- glistening, gleaming, glowing and summoning me:  \\"Take me, Daleband, take me.  I'm 'Dark Side of the Moon', for crying out loud.  I was on the charts for longer than you were in high school.\\"  <br />I mean, come on, I'd be really cool if I owned \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" especially by stealing, right?!  Well, I put it in his CD player (hey...nice CD player) and was awestruck by how awestruck I wasn't.  <br />\\"So this is the greatest rock album of all time?\\" thought I.  \\"But it's so slow.\\"  I surmised that I must not have very good taste and went on about my uncool life.  <br />Years later, I find myself really into King Crimson, Yes and ELP.  Still a spendthrift (but not really a thief), I borrow CD's from the public library and burn 'em.  Well, the library was just overrun with Pink Floyd, so the other day I decided to give \\"Dark Side\\" another shot.  Turns out my horrible tastes have not changed.<br />The sound is amazing for '73, but the dirge-like quality of most of the songs is hard to overcome.  And I think I speak for everyone when I say that Roger Waters sounds ridiculous on \\"Great Gig in the Sky.\\"  Worst falsetto ever.<br />I'm gonna try the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" thing, though.  I guess I'm a sucker for goofy hidden stuff.  I'm also a sucker for candy on a stick, but that's really beside the point.<br />For those unfamiliar with the \\"Wizard\\" thing...  Start the movie without sound.  Once the WB lion roars for the third time, start \\"Dark Side\\" using the \\"repeat entire CD\\" function (or whatever your player calls it.  My cousin's old player...woops...I mean my player calls it \\"repeat all\\").
0525946284|4.0|Jackdaws is clearly the best of Follet's recent books.  The story is set in the UK and France during the period just prior to D-Day in WWII.  The Germans are in the middle of preparations for the massive Allied invasion that they know is inevitable.  The French resistance, supported by the Allies, is doing what it can to be disruptive in advance of the attack.  In the middle of it all is a group of British secret agents who are tasked with destroying a key communications exchange in northern France.  When the first plot is foiled, a more desperate plan based on an all-female attack team is launched.  Jackdaws is an impressive tale of espionage, with intense physical, emotional and intellectual battle being done among the combatants.  It is full of intrigue, twists, turns and surprises that are classic Follet.  The reader is presented with interesting characters and an entertaining, fast-paced story.  Jackdaws will be difficult to put down once you get started.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Personally, I thought the US theatrical release of THE PROFESSIONAL was stellar entertainment ... but then I happened across LEON THE PROFESSIONAL, the original uncut international version ... and I was blown away, much like Leon's victims.<br />Luc Besson's original version is much deeper in characterization and motivation of his anti-hero, Leon (played superbly by Jean Reno).  While the added footage gives the audience a bit more information about Leon's past, it also builds tremendously on the relationship between Leon and Matilda (played by the buddingly beautiful Natalie Portman), his inadvertantly adopted 'partner.'<br />While there are a few scenes that arguably add little to the depth of the story, they are momentary and distract little from the narrative.<br />If you can get your hands on this version, it's well worth the viewing.
B00005OMTT|5.0|LOVE SENSUALITY DEVOTION: THE GREATEST HITS by Enigma is just that. I have the first 3 Enigma albums, and have always enjoyed them because each album has familiar elements sonically, but Michael Cretu assembled them with new themes each time. <br />This compilation includes music from the 4 albums including SCREEN, plus 2 new tracks. The new tracks are OK, but they don't grab the ear as do the other songs. The mix is well done, putting hard-driving rock with more ambient music. One track flows into the next, so it makes for an excellent total listening experience!<br />Best when you're not doing anything but sitting with your eyes closed taking it all in. I find it relaxing and engaging music...<br />A fantastic hits collection for anyone...whether you like it loud or soft!!
0553712837|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and read it in one night. It is funny and an enjoyable read and you really get to feel for Luther and his wish not to participate in Christmas. I am enjoying how Grisham has been moving out of his traditional law arena as he has done with his past two novels. I was a bit dubious at first to read them but I loved them both. Keep up the good work John and to others, don't be put off by the title or the fact that it is not a 'law' book as such. This is a really funny and enjoyable read. If you are a Grisham fan you will enjoy this.
B00004X0ER|5.0|to suggest that the hives are a throwback to the proto-punk of detroit is to totally underestimate the degree and reach of their piracy. it's like they've sucked up every crumb of trashy rock since louie louie and regurgitated it on veni vidi vicious, and they stop just shy of quoting their influences from the sonics to blur (yeah, i said blur). graying aficionados of american punk will find themselves in familiar terrain, but then again, grindcore fans who were probably in diapers when the dolls started purveying their junk-style take on glam will recognize the energy (if not the soul). and somewhere in between, the hives were careful to pick at the carcasses of the new york noise bands of the 80's. so if somebody were to say to me that there's not one original thought on this cd, i'd be hard-pressed to find a rebuttal (except to weakly point out that there's not really an original thought on any cd coming out these days).<br />that doesn't mean i'm not going to go out on a limb and say the hives deserve a place in the pantheon of great RAWK (oy!) based on this album alone though. there's nothing wrong with building on the unique ideas of your forebears, but it does increase the pressure to deliver. imho, they totally deliver. they're tight and cacophonous and obnoxious - everything you'd wanna hear about a rock band. they've hung their talents on memorable, catchy tunes and even the lyrics are kind of smart - in a clipped, snotty punk-... sort of way. there's not a dud in the bunch, including the charming crooner find another girl. highlights are die, all right!, hate to say i told you so, but most of all, main offender. all of 'em brilliant, cathartic, and fun - the sort of butchy summer keg-tunes i like to crank up in my car with the windows all open and howl along to.<br />if you like trashy rock like this, check out royal trux's accelerator too.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I've already reviewed this album once, but here's an extra rock 'n' roll pilgrimage tip for those of us lucky to live in London:<br />If you fancy &quot;steppin' out to Angelucci's for your coffee beans&quot; in the Wild West End, you can: - Angelucci's is still there, On the corner of Frith Street and Old Compton Road, just across from Ronnie Scott's - and it still sells the best coffee in London.<br />But not for much longer - Mr Angelucci is thinking of his moving shop (which has been there since 1929) to Barnet in North London. Mister Knopfler doesn't come by so much any more, I guess.<br />Now, some people here have expressed the opinion that Knopfler isn't much good live. In Shea Stadium, perhaps not - he isn't exactly Freddie Mercury, after all. But anyone lucky enough to have seen him in a small venue, playing the roots blues he is inclined to do these days, will know how good he really is.<br />Very.
B00005QXDD|4.0|Jack Black sure can sing. But this CD might make you feel a little dirty. I love it though, it's hilarious.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Few performers in pop music have had such an impact and continue to do so the way Madonna has since emerging in 1983.  Hers has been a spectacular career filled with hits and a few misses.  She's held the attention of the public longer than just about any living celebrity.  But when you take away the videos, the fashion, the husbands, the children, the scandals, the movies, the  $500 concert tickets, the controversey and the paparazi you are left only with the music.  We tend to forget while standing in awe of the whole package, that the music is truly the heart of The Madonna Media Machine.  And when one takes a second look, as with GHV2, we are quickly reminded that it's some great music.<BR>Spanning the hits from the early nineties right through her latest multi-platinum release \\"Music\\", GHV2 is a solid collection of pop classics, hit singles, and ingenius collaborations.  The only disapointment of this collection is the lack of any extras.  There are no new tracks, no remixes, no surprises.  That's a little disapointing coming from the woman who has kept us guessing all these years.  There are a couple of megamixes that included a bunch of Madonna's hits that were created for this release but, unfortunately, those have only been used for promotion.  MTV ran a clips video and a download of the track was available at the Warner Bros. site for GHV2.  [Amazon.com] has one available as well.  Also, some of the tracks have been edited, which is pretty standard for greatest hits packages.  But with some tracks, like Ray of Light and Human Nature, the cuts are more than a little akward.  And where is \\"American Pie\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\"?  <BR>Still, this is a strong collection that is, at the very least, convenient for ones car stereo.  Not as impressive as The Immacculate Collection, GHV2 is still worth the purchase.  The disc insert is packed with Madonna images spanning her entire career. That alone is worth the money.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I've been a real fan of orchestral soundtracks for years, especially the big sounds and sweeping melodies of such greats as John Williams (Star Wars) and Hans Zimmer (Gladiator). After listening to this soundtrack (5 times in the last 48 hours), I'm convinced that Howard Shore is every bit as good as any other soundtrack composer out there. The first thing you should realize about this soundtrack is that it is quite dark in nature. With the exception of the bouncing second track, &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, this CD is a study in the darkest emotions of music. At times sad, at times almost frightening, Howard Shore's score is by no means a happy one. The voices of the choir (almost reminiscent of Williams' &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;) and Enya's melancholy laments are a nice touch. But though this soundtrack is dark, it is also grand and triumphant. It sweeps you through all the action and scenery of an excellent story. It also manages to capture the soul, depth, and feeling of Tolkien's original masterpiece. As with all good music, words really can't describe it. All in all, this CD is more than worth the cost. If you like the movie, like the book, or just like the sound of a powerful orchestra, you should get a copy of this CD.
B000002J1H|5.0|Going for the One is a great album.  It encompassing energy with mystical thought; romantic songs are present too.  Even Jon Anderson admits that GFTO is the last album of what he calls &quot;The whole topographical period.&quot;  The energy level on this record is higher than on others because Yes felt the heat of the changing musical landscape.  Yet, they were still able to provide the last and arguably best of the their &quot;epic&quot; songs &quot;Awaken&quot; which is my favorite Yes piece.<br />If you put all seven of the great albums on your CD player, you can feel all the music working up to this.  After this was finished, Yes really had no where to go, and the years have shown this to be true.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I think P!nk's new come back is more better than ever! My fave track is Get The Party Started. It is worth buying this album.
0385505833|4.0|As a novelist I found Mr. Grisham to, once again, be capable of telling a story very well without being confined to his original successes!  His versatility is exceptional - all those wonderful legal stories, then A Painted House and now &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, this funny story that touches so many corners of our heart.  I marveled at the wonder of actually laughing with a Grisham book!  It surely will be a light-hearted Christmas movie in the near future.  Bravo for his diversity, his ability to change courses and still show great writing abilities and for proving that a writer can change venues and still be true to his art!
B00005OCMR|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie ever since the early 80s.  Not for the story, which I have to admit is not too good, but for the visuals.  I first saw it in '83 or '84 on VHS and fell in love!  I was an aspiring, teenage computer programmer at the time, and this movie showed me a world of technology that was beyond my dreams.<br />I bought the older DVD a couple years ago, before I even had a player.  It was not available in VHS.  I was afraid it was going to go out of print (I was sure wrong about that).<br />I got the 20th Anniversary edition a week ago, put in the Extras disc and was blown away right off the bat!  There's an intro. to the DVD that runs through the real-world-to-computer-world transition, but it's not just a clip from the movie.  The computer world was computer generated just for this DVD release, and it looks wonderful!  The 3D menus on the Extras disc are like little Tron movies in and of themselves!  Each time you pick an item off the main menu, you are taken (zoomed in) to a different part of the Tron world, where different things start happening, and then the submenu appears.  A real treat!<br />I spent hours going through the extras.  There is so much!  The 1-1/2 hour &quot;Making Of Tron&quot; documentary/interview with the creators and actors is great!  It was made very recently, since someone makes reference to &quot;the XBox&quot; from Microsoft.  It shows interviews with all of the creators and most of the main actors, at their current age.  The ones I recall seeing were Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner, Cindy Morgan, Dan Shor, and Barnard Hughes.  The exceptions I noticed were David Warner (who played Dillinger/Sark), and Peter Jurasik who had a brief role as &quot;Crom.&quot;  Remember, he's the guy who plays against Flynn in the Ring game.  They don't appear in the interviews.<br />I was happy to see that many of the extras I had heard existed on the LaserDisc edition (now out of print) were brought over, including the in-film audio commentary by the creators of Tron.<br />On the movie disc, there is also a 3D computer generated intro. that's very neat (think ring game combined with Tron in the I/O tower), though not as engaging as the one on the Extras disc.  The movie itself plays just fine on my Toshiba SD1700 DVD player, no pauses or quirks (though the back cover of the disc does warn about possible pauses due to the dual-layer print).  The picture is crystal clear and the colors are vivid.  The sound is great as well, THX Certified.<br />All in all, I am SO glad I got this edition.  Looking at the work that went into it, I can't help but think that a group of Tron fans at Disney made it.  It made me fall in love with the movie all over again.<br />If you loved Tron, you will love (and I mean luuuuv!) this DVD.  THANK YOU DISNEY!  It is MUCH better than the older 1998 DVD release, whose only extras were the theater trailer, and the French and Spanish language versions of the movie.
B00005RZV4|5.0|Although I favor Slipknot, Mudvayne, and Nothingface very much, Nine Inch Nails is my all-time favorite group.  Along with Green Day and Soundgarden, NIN was one of the main bands that got me into listening to music.  I practically own pretty much every album they have put out, along with some singles with rare remixes.  I haven't heard an album by NIN that I have ever disliked.  Their new live album is a great accomplishment, and is as of now the best live album I have ever heard.<br />From heavy guitars to rapid drum beats; from loud keyboards to soft piano tone playing, NIN amazes us with so many different unique sounding songs that it is very hard to comprehend them all.  Some are heavy and angry while others are a little softer and less aggressive.  The point is that there is no song that sounds the same as the other.  Each is unique and pleasant sounding to the eardrums.  The recording quality is awesome.  Trent Reznor has an awesome singing voice and still remains as one of the best singers of all time, (at least in my view).<br />The only downside is there are only 16 songs.  NIN has written so many songs that we all love and enjoy hearing that it is impossible to fit them all into one live performance.  Some of your favorite songs might be left out, (as with mine, &quot;We're in this together&quot;), but all of the classics are still there; such as &quot;Closer,&quot; &quot;Terrible lie,&quot; &quot;Sin,&quot; &quot;Hurt,&quot; &quot;Wish,&quot; &quot;Gave up,&quot; and many, many more.<br />If you are a true NIN fanatic, I suggest that you get the two disk set.  The second CD are remixes (acoustic sounding) of old and new songs, as well with a few unreleased tracks. I really only recommend this to true NIN fans.  People who only &quot;like&quot; NIN may not find the second CD as satisfying.  It also comes in a really cool sturdy case.<br />I also recommend the DVD version of this live performance.  The video and sound quality are off the charts.  I will later on write a review for it as well.<br />Let's face it:  NIN is one of the greatest bands of all time, and Trent Reznor is an absolute genius when it comes to song writing and performance.  He really has a unique singing voice, as well as  violent screaming and yelling.  What he can do with a keyboard is just breathtaking.  Get this album as soon as you can.  If you are a true NIN fan, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; is a great NIN album that you shouldn't miss.ter on write a review for it as well.<br />Let's face it:  NIN is one of the greatest bands of all time, and Trent Reznor is an absolute genius when it comes to song writing and performance.

B00005YTFG|5.0|When a great MOVIE like Moulin Rouge gets everyone's attention in my family, it's almost a  miracle.  It is so great we all enjoy it TOGETHER!    <br />Moulin Rouge has EVERYTHING we all sometimes take for granted in our lives.  Love, Beauty, Freedom, Truth, Envy, Jelousy, beutiful songs, etc.  Everything's covered.  The dance scenes are very exciting!  It makes me and others want to get up and do the CAN-CAN!  <br />I love all of the characters!!  The only way I can describe my feelings about Moulin Rouge to the fullest, is in spanish and Moulin Rouge is TREMENDAMENTE FABULOSA!
B00005J73X|2.0|okay i'll cut the crap i'm a die hard bj fan so this album was such an exitment for me when i recieved the album i wonderd what classics will be on this? i was saddended to see no,always,bed of roses,blaze of glory,lay your hands on me,in these arms born to be my baby,hey god,i'll be there for you,and many more but instead i was faced with,bob geldof with the rendition of ''i don't like mondays'''!why.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|I watched this movie with my husband and we both really liked it. I am a cartoom-movie fan so I especially liked it because it was unusual and funny, but still a nice fairy tale and very well drawn and animated. The animation is actually absolutely brilliant, it really looks more like a movie than a cartoon!<br />I think some kids can watch this movie and enjoy the fairy tale aspect, but on the other hand, I think that some kids around 7 and 8 won't get, as one reviewer objected, some of the jokes, which are actually not targeted for that age, but more for a late teen and adult audience. I would not say the jokes are downright dirty, some have a double meaning but they are not vulgar or offensive and I don't see the need to get offended. I would not buy it specifically for a kid, but it is a movie that the whole family can watch together.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I bought this cd right before christmas,I drove to California from Texas with my brother and we listened to this cd over and over again!I was giving my son a truck for Christmas(HE is 17)and the truck had a 4 thousand dollar sterio system in it.When we arrived in California.I was at a relatives house and the truck was ripped off in broad daylight!I got the truck back the next day but the sterio was stolen and also my cd`s.I was real upset about the whole situation,but the same day I got mytruck back I bought This cd again and rocked out the rest of the week in California.Even my son liked it!I know I didn`t get into detail about the songs,But if you like smokin heavy metal,Iron Maiden is back!
B000059LGC|4.0|OK, those died-in-the-wool Christie fans had better give this a miss and stick with David Suchet. <BR>But, just as Margaret Rutherford did a totally unauthentic, but delightful, version of Miss Marple, Peter Ustinov gives us an equally enchanting version of Hercule Poirot. <BR>No, it's not Christie's Poirot, but it's still a lot of fun.<BR>Christie's plot is basically kept in tact, but it is the all-star performance which, for once, shines through.<BR>David Niven does a wonderfully English 'Hastings' impersonation (far more interesting than the original character in the book in fact). Bette Davis and Maggie Smith do star turns as the NY matron and her companion , but the whole film is stolen by Angela Lansbury as the alcoholic 'romantic' novelist, Salome Otterbourne. Her 'authentic' tango with David Niven is a cinematic classic.<BR>The idea the 'everyone could have done it' is rather laboured, but if you can suspend disbelief, this film is loads of fun.<BR>If you like your Christie with panashe, then this is the film for you.
0698116496|5.0|For those youngsters who are familiar with \\"Good Night Moon,\\" this is a wonderful addition to their library.   While there are some similarities that a youngster may or may not pick up on, the illustrations help to move the story along in an original and enchanting way.<BR>This is a wonderful introduction to the zoo and many of the animals found there
0446678430|1.0|In brief, if you have read any of the other Rich Dad books then this does not add anything. The content is a rehash of the earlier Rich Dad books but with very annoying tendencies to shamelessly plug other Rich Dad books, a Rich Dad game and the website. If the author is as rich as he claims, why does he need to do this?<br />All the Rich Dad books have as the central theme that people are wasting their time trying to become affluent or rich by means of working in a regular job. Instead the way to affluence is through entrepreneurial activity. This is a welcome change from the regular financial books that stress 401(k) investments in the stock market and the Rich Dad series are worth reading just to get this alternative perspective. There comes a point, however, when excessive hype can destroy the message and this point may have been reached in the Rich Dad series.
0930289234|4.0|To be honest, if you've read Michael Moorcock's non-fantasy novels, you've read most of what's new in comics from Gaiman to Morrison.  Moore, too, took a lot from Moorcock (including his<br />'JC' signature characters) but is probably the only graphic writer to have  built solidly on his original inspiration. Read this and then read From Hell and you will see a writer developing his craft to a very high degree -- getting better, subtler, more pointed.  This still remains one of the classics of the field, but Moore has come a long way since then.  Only Moore really backs up the claims of comics fans that the medium has reached some kind of maturity.  There is mature work out there, including Bryan Talbot's Tale of One Bad Rat and his Luther Arkwright stories, but Moore remains the most consistent and interesting of the great innovators.

B00003CX9E|5.0|This DVD is probably the best DVD that I own (I have close to 200). With all the extras that come with it and the details that are included, it's not only a great movie, but it's a great resource as well for movie buffs. The history behind the movie and the documentary &quot;The Battle over Citizen Kane&quot; (included) is wonderful and it really shows the wild creativity that Orson Welles displays in his first film effort. This DVD is terrific!
B00003CXXP|5.0|An awsome spectacle...truly captivating movie that one will either love or loathe. Ignore the too obvious analogy of Pinocchio - yes it does draw from this story, but there's much more to it that that. The other side of the coin, and the darker aspect of the movie draws deeply fro the classic tale of Oedipus. This is a compelling blend of Greek tragedy, fairy tales and a classic sci-fi short story.<BR>First rate performances all round, and a story well told on several levels. The only mildly distracting mechanism is the clear shift from a typically thought provoking Kubrick feel to a Spielberg \\"ET\\" like theme. It works, but is a bit too contrived. This is not a movie you sit back & watch it happen around you. It grabs you & demands you invest thought and energy into the experience. At ~ 3 hours, I can see why some complain, but it's time well spent if you really want more than the usual aseptic, thoughtless Hollywood formula. <BR>AI is truly a richly textured and emotioanlly/intellectually challenging movie - which is perhaps the major reason it clearly divided the audience.

Great visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Dream Quest Images using Computer Generated Imagery (CGI), which they are Superb (Oscar Winner for Visual Effects).

B000002UBU|4.0|This CD is great if only for the title song... Most people that I have talked to know American Pie by Don McLean, even if they don't know it by name. I enjoy some of the other songs on the CD as well, and Don McLean does an excellent job of conveying emotion into a very well themed CD, however, none of the other songs live up to the reputation established by American Pie. If you are a lover of oldies music, or even just rock and roll music, Don McLean's song American Pie is sure to delight you with its sad, rock and roll style antics. For the price that you are paying, it is well worth the music of this somewhat underappreciated artist.

B00005JKQX|4.0|Was interested in seeing this movie after viewing an interview of Ron Howard by Charlie Rose on PBS.  I've enjoyed a number of his films in the past, and wondered how he would tackle this complex story.  I was so swept away by his delusions, I was disappointed to learn that they were mere products of his imagination.  Had heard talk of the psychological community not fully appreciating this film because it gives the false impression that schizophrenia is curable, when most cases are in fact not.  Still, an engaging movie, and I was surprised to see so many viewers in Honolulu for what I thought might be a \\"hard sell\\".  Due to the strength of his performance, Russell Crowell carries the film, and for this should be applauded.  I attended the film with a classmate who teaches courses in psychology, and she agrees with my assessment.

B00005RFQ5|4.0|To me \\"Rainbow Children\\" is Prince's most musically & lyrically adventurous and inspired not to mention ARTISTIC album since \\"Lovesexy\\".  When he left Warners, I was kinda expecting him to go on and produce something amazing as I believed he would be free of record company control and the pressure for hits and radio play.  Maybe that was naive of me but I was profoundly disappointed by the overlong and asinine \\"Emancipation\\", the vapid and half-baked \\"Nu Power Soul\\" and the unfocussed and slightly desparate to be relevant sounding \\"Rave Un2 The Joy Fantasic\\".  As a result, I had more or less given up on the guy and approached this disc with extreme weariness - I bought it more out of curiousity than in the expectation of total excellence.  But incredibly, that is what I found!  <br />The music is outstanding in every field - in composition, in arrangements and in the performances themselves which have a refreshing \\"live\\" feel.  Yes, the \\"Rainbow Children\\" does seem far stronger when listened to as a whole from beginning to end but that is because it is so cohesive - (most of) the tracks are individually very strong!  Standouts for me include the exhilarating \\"Everywhere\\", the amazingly tight Sly meets JB funk of \\"The Work\\", the quite lovely and relatively straightforward, \\"She Loves Me For Me\\" and the funky and lyrically wry \\"Family Name\\".<br />I feel that this is a deeply personal album for Prince.  Musically, he is really wearing his influences on his sleeve.  This for me is most obvious in the homage to \\"In A Silent Way\\" era Miles which is the title track and the Stevie Wonder-esq postivity and melodiousness of \\"Everywhere\\".  And lyrically, he is wearing his heart on his sleeve.  I don't agree that the content is sexist or racist as some have claimed.  Yeah, the voice overs are a little weird and freaky but even if you don't agree with what Prince is trying to say, I give him full respect for attempting to share his vision with us.<br />Anyways approach this discwith an open mind (and open ears, of course!) and you will be amply rewarded.  <br />PS. And for my money, apart from \\"Rainbow Children\\", the only other post-80s Prince disc I would wholeheartedly endorse is \\"The Gold Experience\\"!

0671688782|5.0|I would like to express a deep admiration for Dr. Welch and her 26+ years experience with her Holding Time therapy. It is not a fad therapy, but is based upon the findings of Nobel Prize-winning Ethologist Niko Tinbergen and attachment theory scientist John Bowlby. Tinbergen devoted the last ten years of his life to bring attention to Dr. Welch work. Welch Holding Time therapy applies the findings of these two scientists and other findings in neuroscience - mainly that behavior is conditioned, and that conditioned behavior can be changed. Dr. Welch has proven this through her treatment of reactive attachment disorder, ADD, ADHD, as well as a wide range of behavioral problems, including Autism. Dr. Welch is not only a practicing psychiatrist of long standing, she is a respected neuroscientist doing research at Columbia University in New York City with some of the world's foremost scientists. She is about to publish her findings on the brain chemistry that makes Holding Time work.<br />Readers should remember that families who attend Dr. Welch's intensive treatment sessions have children who exhibit extreme behavioral problems. The book, Holding Time, was written by Dr. Welch to help the average family experiencing behavioral problems. People who attend her intensives are desparate - their children, adopted or not, are often so far out of control that if they cannot be helped they will be institutionalized. I have witnessed two consecutive intensive treatment sessions in which the principals of Holding Time have been employed. I found them to be miracles of healing to the 15 families that participated.  All of the families that I witnessed left with dramatically changed children and new Holding Time parenting tools with which they could manage their child's behavior at home.<br />Please keep an open mind. Buy the book and read it. See the videos and CD's available... To those critics of Holding Time, consider the source. Above all, try Holding Time with your child. The results are uniformly positive, regardless of family history. Connection, once experienced, extends to all other relationships and fosters empathic behavior. Isn't this what we're trying to achieve? God bless Dr. Welch.

I'd never seen such ham-handed cinematic waste in my life.

Lots of good piano stylings here and a real variety of material. &quot;Baby Ain't I Good To You&quot; and &quot;If I Had You' are real gems. The upbeat &quot;Hit That Jive Jack'&quot; really swings. Her most requested signature &quot;Frim Fram Sauce&quot; is there too.

B00004VVNC|5.0|This movie is a wonderful love story.  I own this movie and it makes me cry everytime I watch it.  There are so many touching moments.  So many things are taken for granted in life and disappear before anyone can appreciate them, and this movie shows us how quickly things pass us by.  Brad Pitt is a wonderful actor as well as an extremely attractive man, which makes this movie a real winner in my book :)
B00005NI5Y|5.0|What a refreshing album from a man who continues to amaze me. Dylan is back on the tracks with this one.  It sheds the darkness of &quot;Time out of mind&quot; and fills in the spaces with colorful music, and clever lyrics.  It displays the dignity of &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, with a twist of playful sarcasm like &quot;Bringing it all back home&quot;.  If you are a Dylan fan you will not be disapointed, if you are not a Dylan fan..You just might become one. Trust me on this one...Fantastic
0671688782|5.0|Welch Holding Time was the only viable and effective solution to the problems we were experiencing in our family.  In fact, today, it is not only a solution, but also an integral part of our lives.  <br />My husband and I adopted two children as toddlers, both of whom were experiencing attachment problems due to backgrounds of abuse and neglect.  On one end of the continuum, we had a son who was aggressive, violent, defiant, and demanding.  On the other end, we had a daughter who was overly compliant in her behavior, yet completely incoherent in her thought process and extremely independent and distant from her family.<br />In trying to mother both of our children, I myself became engulfed with my own unresolved childhood issues.  The rejection and the lack of control I was experiencing with them pulled me to the depths of my pain from my own childhood.  My own relationship with my mother and father were also becoming more and more tense as I tried to help and mother my children.   All of this created a barrier between my children and me.<br />Welch Holding Time was the only therapy that allowed healing and resolution to this downward and painful spiral of discord within my family.  Traditional methods such as play therapy, behavioral modification, and cognitive restructuring were absolutely no use.  Welch bonding reached deep within myself, my parents, and, most importantly, within my hurting children.  <br />My children are finally healing and we are enjoying beautiful and reciprocal relationships.  Welch Holding has allowed our children to leave behind the anger, the hurt, and the sadness and has allowed the gentleness, the kindness, and the playfulness within each one of them to surface once more.  They are back to being the way God designed them to be.

The pretty, twinkling Take A Bow is a warm bath by comparison, but again filled with Madonna's particular brand of wistful romantic longing.<BR>More songwriterly are the intelligent, tuneful Substitute For Love, slinky acoustic Secret, and 2001's Express Yourself sequel What It Feels Like For A Girl, with its shimmering guitars and funkydrummer hook.  However, Old Quicksilver is quickly into a more familiar groove, dancing for inspiration to the techno-ethereal-rhinestone-psychodelic beats of Don't Tell Me, Ray of Light, Beautiful Stranger and the mechanical Music.<BR>As always we wonder: what next?<BR>Footnote: Check out the dazzling mosaic ofvideo stills and record sleeve photography on the inside cover  - schizoid voguing poses through the years!

B000002572|5.0|This is one of those select albums I have owned on vinyl, cassette, and now CD.  Boston's debut was a landmark album, one that has stood the test of time and remains a regular spin on classic rock radio stations everywhere.  There's a reason for that kind of longevity: the album is brilliant.  <br />These songs are anthems of classic rock.  On this album, Boston delivers a powerful combination of intelligent compositions following the progressive rock tradition of the 70's, masterful musicianship, and superb vocal performance.  Who in rock and roll has a voice better than Brad Delp???  Who in rock and roll can play music with more energy and intensity than Boston exhibits on this album???  Folks, it simply doesn't get any better than this!!!  <br />This album sounded great on vinyl and cassette, but on the digitally recorded CD, it's near perfection.  Treat yourself to an unforgettable audio experience: get this CD, put on the third track, and crank it up on high quality speakers!!!
B000002UUX|5.0|I got into Megadeth year ago, and being a huge Metalica fan, I was looking for something similiar and also as good. After failing to understand the point in Slayer and Sepultura, a friend of mine told me to try this album. I listened to \\"Peace Sells\\" and \\"Killing is My Business\\" before and I didn't particulary liked them, so I was preety sceptic.<BR>Man was I wrong! This album is one of the rare things that can be called a true Metal classic, something that can compare itself with \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\". Every song on this album is a very strong piece, with some of my favourites being \\"Hangar 18\\", with probably the best solo ever written, \\"Holly Wars\\", a true trash-metal classic, and \\"Poison was the Cure\\", sounding a lot like punk song, yet being metal all the way through.<BR>It is a sad thing that this was the last album that Megadeth wrote with this kind of intensity. Their later work is very solid, but it is completely different genre, and it can't even begin to compare to power of \\"Rust in Peace\\".
B000001EUL|5.0|This disc welcomed Michael Schenker, younger brother of Rudy Schenker, back to the Scorpions for the first time since Lonesome Crow. Lovedrive, though, is a much improved and mature Scorpions sound. The only loss her is the guitar work of Uli Roth, who is more than ablely replaced by the young virtuoso guitarist Michael Schenker. This is the sound that would propel Scorpions into Superstardom.<br />I'd give you a list of the good songs, but I can't honestly call any of them bad! From great instrumentals like &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; to the reggae sounds of &quot;Is There Anybody There&quot;, to the hard rockin' &quot;Another Piece of Meat&quot; and the ballad &quot;Holiday&quot;, there is no weakest link on this CD. If I didn't already own a copy of this disc, I'd be on line buying it now! What are you waiting for....I'm telling you, this is a great disc!

The intensity never lets up!<br />My favorites are &quot;747&quot; and &quot;Freeway Mad&quot;, but there is nothing to scoff at here. Discover why Saxon still draws crowds to their live shows with this masterpiece of metal. This is a great start up disc for those who don't know Saxon, although I would suggest spending the extra couple bucks and get the Wheels of Steel/Strong Arm compilation. You will pat yourself on the back for such genius and some lady in leather might just love you for it!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is another installment in the \\"rap-metal\\" genre that has been slammed so much by critics lately.  Yet, they seem to avoid the criticism directed at bands such as Limp Bizkit.  I wonder why?  It's because unlike Bizkit, they actually have talent.  They are not a couple of guys playing music while some idiot tries to be something he's not (...).  They come up with great beats, play instruments very wll, scream at all the right moments, and even (SHOCKER!!) sing on key, which Durst will never do.  Very well done, very well produced, overall a great CD.

0385505833|3.0|I read this book in one sitting during an hour and a half long free period. It was funny, not that original, but still worth reading. The characters didn'texactly come to life, and I wish I had neighbors as nice as the main characers. if I hadn't been given it for christmas I probably would not have read it at all, and I certainly wouldn't buy it for myself, so If I were you I'd wait until its in your local Library.<br />I'd say 3 and a half stars.
B00000IFWE|5.0|petty proves once again, that he's still in fine-form lyrically and vocally. this is his best album of the 90s, not only because more than 3/4s of the tracks on this album rang true for me one way or the other, but because the songs are so polished and real, its amazing how petty can continue to make up these incredible songs! this is an album of a true artist at work, he's got nothing to prove, no one that he needs to impress, and yet still he gets such a true album out that is simply without blemish. very cool, very real, must listen.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|The first part of this film showing the title character Shrek and his many ogre ways (killing, eating, and scaring) along with the lampooning of all favorite childhood fairytale characters from the Three Little Pigs to the Gingerbread Man (lampooning Disney in general), was all great fun.  Up to that point, its a pretty good film. However, when Shrek saves the princess from the dragon, it get's sappy and predictable from there.  The CGI animation is top notch and the voiceovers are excellent (Eddie Murphy/Donkey was a little annoying). Overall, it is a nice family film only to be seen once. The critics were too generous to this film. I was hoping Shrek could go back to his ogre ways and really do some maiming, scaring etc...
1577311523|5.0|I picked up \\"The Power of Now\\" in the \\"New Age\\" section of the bookstore.  I was determined to make the reading about \\"spirituality\\" a short episode in my life... and I was probably right, as far as the reading goes, that is.<br />I got the book and continued reading at home, and, as I often do with study guides and textbooks, started underlining what seemed most important. Soon it became harder to separate the important from the unimportant, because it all seemed important!   Then, I stopped, put down the pencil and said: \\"Wow!\\"<br />Where did this book come from?  Why aren't we hearing about it on CNN?  Reading it felt strange at first, as it demanded my total attention: either I was drawn deep into it, or not at all.  Do you like to eat while reading?  Well, this book will make you feel ridiculous if you try to eat and read at the same time!  <br />The book showed me that I have a pretty thick mold of the mind to break through, and it took me very far on the first day, even farther after that.  The message went beyond what I would probably recognize on my own.  After all, I was (and still am but to a lesser degree) one of those constant thinkers who mistakenly believe that it's good to think all the time but almost never stop to see, hear and feel the essence of being.  Although the message in the book seems familiar and simple, in the end it provided exhaustive answers to the few questions that I had and also those that I wouldn't have thought of before.  Amazingly, it also managed not to raise new ones.  What it did was grab me by lapels and put me into the present moment.  Over and over again, it told me what it means, how to enter it, offered a few different methods, and suggested that with practice many opportunities exist to enter it.<br />Another point is that once I finished the book, its message lingered (may I say \\"in my mind\\" here?).  The author's obvious and at the same time subtly effective, repetitive approach somehow kept reassuring me that I was absorbing and remembering the material.  The text never strayed far from the core of the message, which seemed to stick with vivid clarity.  <br />I soon began to practice shifting myself into this state of intense concentration, and it feels strange and alluring at the same time, this detachment from the mind. At first, I could only do it while being completely relaxed, just before falling asleep.  Later, it became easier to do along with other daily activities.  Don't worry; you will not get hit by a truck while crossing the street and trying to focus into the Now!   Also, the people at work will not laugh at you because you look weird trying to focus, but they may notice a difference in you: that you are relaxed, focused and less confrontational (because you are surrendered to the present moment).  The most immediate effect for me was that focusing into the present moment helped me communicate better. I began to listen more intensely, meaningfully and less judgmentally than before.   <br />However, I feel that this is only the tip of an iceberg.  Trying to be in the Now has inspired me more than any miracle.  At the same time, it's clear that learning to live in the Now is a skill, and like any skill it can be enhanced with practice.  The more you work at it, the better and more natural you get doing it.  <br />In short, I don't need to search for the truth anymore.  I got lucky on the first try, by becoming a little curious with the book that seemed unassuming and light in physical weight.  Thank you, Eckhart. NOW, I can be at peace, knowing how much I can look forward to in this life, and beyond.
B000002JS6|5.0|At the end of the 70s, AC/DC was riding high with a string of strong selling records. Coming off the success of their latest album, Highway To Hell, the band decided to record a follow-up. But the follow-up wouldn't come; at least not with Bon Scott tearing it up on vocals. <br />Before the band could do the vocals for the record, Bon Scott died in an alcohol-related tragedy. This album was written and recorded in memory of him.<br />With the hiring of a new snger, this album propelled the band to their legendary status. And why wouldn't it have done that? Brian Johnson's vocals are young and full of raw energy. The combination of Malcolm and Angus Young's guitars are, as always, a rhythm progression of power chords with Angus' blistering solos here and there while bassist Cliff Williams and drummer Phil Rudd throw down the usual simple rhythm and beats found in their earlier work. Together, they molded a rock and roll masterpiece that is unrivaled by most AC/DC albums.<br />Each song is filled with the \\"rock and roll rules\\" and sexual wit AC/DC has come to be known for. Hells Bells starts the album off hard with the bell chime and unmistakable guitar piece that follows. This is a slower song with a great feel and wicked lyrics. Shoot To Thrill picks up the speed of the album and flows into What Do You Do For The Money Honey and Given The Dog A Bone, which are all good, rocking songs. Let Me Put My Love Into You is one of the best tracks on the CD and also a little different from the rest. It has a slower feel to it than the previous three but the guitar is great and Johnson's vocals shine here, especially on the chorus where his voice seems to have melody. Back In Black follows with one of the most memorable guitar intros ever. This song is full of power and all members of the band are great here. Have A Drink On Me is an upbeat song about drinking. Great song with a cool feel to it. The same can be said about the next track, Shake A Leg. The final song, Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution is another on of the best. It is hard-edged bluesy track with great guitars and excellent vocals.<br />On this album, the band's youth and energy shows and by this time, they were ready for the world. And apparently, the world was ready for them, having sold 19 million copies of the album in the US alone, to date. The money people spent on this album was in no way wasted. All AC/DC fans will love this alum as well as fans of their bluesy, hard rock style and edge.
0140186395|5.0|This book opens up with the most persuasive commercial I've ever encountered - it's a commercial for California.  And it stays on such a standard for the rest of its great length.  It encompasses so many of the struggles, feelings, and victories that \\"the man's man\\" feels, and that the rest of us can feel too.  This book is so human.  We find ourselves wanting more than anything for Adam Trask to be stronger, for Charles to do something good, not for goodness' sake but for his own.  We want Samuel Hamilton to come over to the Trask house again.  We want to go there and live in all of this.  <br />Then, as Cal and Aron grow up and distinguish themselves from one another, we find their most distant of moments our saddest, their laughter becomes ours, and near the end (which I won't spoil) we want so much for Adam, Cal, and Aron to have more time to spend together.  When I finish this book the next time around I'll have to give my brother a call.  or maybe just go home for a week to spend time with him.  Great book.  Great book.<br />Even for the reader who remains separate from the characters, East of Eden is a story about the most intriguing of human actions.  The reason I say this book is so human is because of the characters.  They make the action, of which there is plenty, not the other way around.  It is not a boring book - Steinbeck filled it with plenty of interesting and complex characters who all refuse to be spectators and show themselves instead to be agents of goodwill, love, hate, evil, jealousy, ambition, and embrace.
B00000BKDS|5.0|After years of line-up changing and a change or two in the band name, Iron Maiden went into the studio to record their debut album. Released in 1980, their self-titled debut CD started them on the road to success and legendary status as one of the pioneers of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal.<br />This album has a raw edge that is not seen on their later releases (maybe No Prayer For The Dying) and that makes it all the more better. With a more punk feel than the straight-forward metal they would come to write and record, this album is a classic and a great start for the band. Guitarist Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton deliver the songs wonderfully with the usual power chords and harmonic leads. Paul Di'Anno takes his spot before the microphone and belts out all the Maiden classics. While not being as powerful as Dickinson, Di'Anno is a great singer and his vocals mix well with the music. Steve Harris, yet again, has his way of making the bass heard and plays with the intensity that he has come to be known for. Behind the drums is Clive Burr, playing simple, solid and catchy beats that suit the raw power of each song.<br />The album begins with Prowler which is a really catchy song with some great guitar. Di'Anno's vocals are great on this song and Burr's drumming is wonderful. Sanctuary is a faster, more guitar driven track. Its got a punk feel with great rhythm and an awesome solo. Remember Tomorrow starts off slow and develops into a rocker. The vocals are great and the guitars are superb. Simply a classic song. Running Free is another awesome song because of the feel of the song. Each of the instruments are played incredibly well and the vocals are catchy. Phantom Of The Opera is another upbeat song, like Sanctuary. The guitar is great, the the overbearing presence of the bass midway through the track is amazing and the drumming is excellent. Transylvania is a fast-paced, guitar driven instrumental. The song is excellent with fast guitars and a well played rhythm. Strange World is a step away from the sound of the rest of the album and it soft and quiet straight through. Di'Anno's vocals shine and the solo is masterful. Charlotte The Harlot is punk-type song with a love-type theme. The song is fairly fast-paced until the song slows down and the guitar is more classical with the bass popping in and out. Incredible song. The last song, Iron Maiden, is a great closing song. Awesome guitars and bass with an extremely catchy chorus.<br />Iron Maiden's self-titled debut started their slow rise to the top, but they didn't really get started until Bruce Dickinson joined the band. But this is definitely an incredible start. Iron Maiden fans would be pleased and fans of punk-rock may like this as well. Its definitely something to check out.
0385505833|1.0|A big Grisham fan, I was terribly disappointed with this book.  It was redundant and I could not finish it.  I bought it with such joy and anticipation because I completely loved A Painted House (I want a sequal to that)and expected another beautifully written novel that was not centered on law.  Every page seemed to be a chore to read.  I pick it up still in hopes that eventually the story will go somewhere, but I am more than 3/4 finished with it and still am not interested.  If you want a good Grisham novel, read A Painted House.  That was one I could not put down- it was a &quot;call in sick to work&quot; kind of book.
0446608955|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the novel, A Walk to Remember. Sparks did an excellent job developing the characters of Jamie and Landon and expressing their feelings. This book tells a story about young true love and how Landon became a better person because the great love of his life. I absolutely could not put it down and look forward to seeing the movie. Spark also did an excellent job developing the plot, and like any good novel there was a moral to this story.
B00005UMTF|4.0|...And this comes from someone who can handle such albums as A Passion Play. This Was, from 1968 differs from all other Tull albums because Martin Barre isn't even on this album, instead you have Mick Abrahams on guitar whose guitar style owes to the likes of Clapton and Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green. This is also by far their most blues oriented album of them all, and as a progressive rock fan, I usually don't go for the British blues revival of the late 1960s but this album sticks way above all that, simply because this is Jethro Tull. At this point, Ian Anderson seemed to have more a bluesy type of voice and is not as deep as say, Songs From the Wood. His trademark flute playing is also ever present. This is also by far their most group oriented album. Anderson doesn't write everything here. &quot;Dharma For One&quot; was co-written by Clive Bunker. &quot;Serenade to a Cuckoo&quot; was a cover of a Roland Kirk song (Anderson was a big fan of Roland Kirk and was a big influence on his flute playing). &quot;Move On Alone&quot; was sung by Mick Abrahams and is the only Jethro Tull song I ever heard that featured vocals from someone other than Anderson. At that time Jethro Tull was praised as the &quot;next Cream&quot;, and just like Cream before them, they do a version of &quot;Cat's Squirrel&quot; which just simply blows me away, especially the intensity. &quot;Beggar's Farm&quot; is a wonderful piece that shows more where this band will be heading. &quot;Some Day the Sun Won't Shine For You&quot; is a rather mellow, laid back blues piece. The all-too-short &quot;Round&quot; is a nice pleasant jazzy number with flute. But because it was 1968, and the British blues revival was starting to lose steam in the next couple of years, Jethro Tull moved to different styles and continuted to released more great albums over the next few years. So if you fancy the idea of Jethro Tull playing the blues or you want to know the roots of the band, then give This Was a try.
B000002BMV|5.0|The problem is that my Hi-fi just does not go loud enough when playing this CD,from the Storming outset of 'Don't stop believin'<BR>through the blazing 'stone in love' I find myself checking the volume control just to make sure I'm getting all it can give. With an album like this, you want to make sure the neighbours get to appreciate, what you already know, is the good stuff. Steve Perry's voice had me hooked the first time I heard  Seperate ways' and this album just confirms it. There are no prizes for witty lyric writing here, just good old fashioned down to earth music you can lose yourself in. 'Who's cryin now' is a powerful Balad that need little introduction, and the diverse 'still they ride' proves these guys are not stuck in a rut. 'Open arms' a popular track anyway concludes this polished<BR>and entertaining album, following the moving  track  'mother,father'. And then the music end's and I'm left wondering why I have a sore throat again...
B000050XEI|5.0|I remember watching a TV show that made fun of Enya because she's so touchy and wishywashy. And I remember my mom saying how much she likes Enya. I remember my sisters saying they love Enya, too. These are my three reasons for not wanting to like Enya. But then I listen to her and love her. Her song 'Only Time' is beautiful. It's so touching and beautiful I can't help myself. I say to myself, 'Snap out of it!' but then listen and want to cry.

B00005RFAI|1.0|For many artists, change is good. But change is only good if you evolve to something. In the case of this album, Pink regressed. Admittedly, I had high expectations for this album. Was I wrong for this? No. Her first album was a well crafted blend of R&B and Pop which Pink now seems to have abandoned. Yet instead Pink wishes to be rock and roll..which would be fine...if it were good. But the album is lacking in many departments.<br />The lyrics are laughable (My Vietnam and Don't Let Me Get Me) and the tracks are uninspired. She wishes to be the new milleniums answer to 4 Non Blondes, but who of us remembers their hit single? The lone good song on this album is 'Get This Party Started' and even this song in comparison to her last efforts is sub par. I'm not saying that she shouldn't branch out into other areas of the musical landscape, but she should strive for perfection while doing so. And this effort is not 'IT'. Pink definitely has the talent. I've heard her give a stirring rendition of a Stevie Nicks song on a behind the scenes look at last tour, and it was GREAT. Pink can sing. She has a strong voice that is capable of delivering soul, rock and pop. It's just that the material that she chose and wrote leaves much to be desired.
B00000IBRX|1.0|Finally caught this on the sci-fi channel and eagerly anticipated watching it after a few folks told me how impressed they were.  I have to wonder now about the sanity of these few folks.  Or the \\"majority\\" of reviewers here who have averaged out this total piece of gargage to 4 stars.  Amazon, you should REALLY allow reviewers to give a film ZERO stars, or BELOW ZERO.  I feel guilty now that I HAVE to give this one star when it deserves about MINUS TEN.  If there is a hell, I think it be would something like being strapped down in a chair with your eyes forced open (like in Clockwork Orange), and being forced to watch this complete misfire over and over and over again, for all eternity.  Sci-fi channel shows SO many commercials when they have a feature film, but this time, the commercials were a welcome relief.  Wish I had taped this, but if I had I guess I would've just started fast forwarding 10 minutes in, and missed this little glimpse of cinematic hell.<br />This movie reminds me of other big time losers like Mission to Mars, Battlefield Earth, Thin Red Line, and so on.  Lots of pretty effects, but there is nothing else.  Put on a nice screensaver and play some music instead.  Bad story, bad concept, plotholes enough to fill a stadium, good actors caught up in script-hell, sappy music, makes no sense from start to painful finish.  This is a 4 alka seltzer special.  They should take the original film, cut it into individual frames, re-arrange those frames randomly, and it would be a big improvement.  Slow, slow, slow, stupidity and bad dialogue at every turn.  This is like watching Spielberg's \\"1941\\" on acid.  It's like biting down hard on a big rusty nail and hearing the crunch of your former teeth.  It's like having someone take a big sloppy bucket of foul-smelling brightly colored paint, dipping a huge mop into it, and shoving it into your eyes until they exit the back of your head, along with your brains.  I bet this screenplay was written with crayons, by the \\"devil\\" himself to torture us all.  I kept expecting Robin Williams to turn straight towards the camera and scream \\"help me, how do I get out of this hellish film?!\\"  I think they should add a warning to the beginning of this, \\"may cause brain cancer, glaucoma, loss of hearing, and tooth rot.\\"  Within a half an hour I was glad there were so many commercials because I had the runs.  I found breathing difficult throughout so much that I almost called 911.  I wish I could write the filmmakers and ask for a refund of the tiny little amount of time in my whole life that was completely wasted watching this utter nonsense.<br />More painful than a root canal with a power drill.  It's a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie.  I really have to question the sanity of anyone who actually likes this.  This is paint by numbers filmmaking, done by artists without any hands or toes, or SOUL.  This is like listening to a Carpenters album while watching the 700 Club while eating a big bowl of you-know-what sprinkled with brown sugar.

068484267X|5.0|I read this book on a plane headed to Los Angeles and simply could not put it down! I was completely engrossed from the moment I began reading it until the moment I finished. This book gave me a lot to think about. The mere openness of Mr. McCourt concerning his life was amazing. I was often times livid about the way in which he had to go about his life, and felt the pain of his mother who in her own way remained strong and hopeful during his father's constant battle to find stable employment. <br />His father was a very interesting man. I believe that he was suffering from a broken-heart due to the loss of his daughter and<BR>twin sons. I believe the elder McCourt could have been an author or story-teller within his own right. I feel that such things can be a given and passed down from generation to generation. I think that this indeed was an interesting point that Mr. McCourt made in his movie and book that his father was always telling him stories in which apparently he remembered and retained.<br />It is hard to imagine how one could have survived such an upbringing; nevertheless this book is a perfect example how Mr. McCourt was ever so eloquent in his one dream of coming to America.  I was touched by his willingness on several occassions in which even as a child he worked and tried to take on the responsibilities of caring for his family. I thought that was beautiful when he became in the very words of his father when he left for London, \\"the man of the house.\\"<br />Mr. McCourt honesty and straight-forwardness about the events that occurred in his life makes him one the most beautiful authors that I know. Honesty within itself is a beautiful thing. The freedom to write an honest piece of work is far more intriguing.  <br />I love this book it touched my life. I have read this book more than once, and somehow when I want to place myself within a situation of all odds I read this . . . And then I am reminded of the dream of Mr. Frank McCourt and I am totally convinced that anything is possible within my life if only I just BELIEVE! <br />I highly recommend this book to all . . . it is one excellent read!
0553062182|4.0|I was fortunate enough to meet Elaine Aron early on before she published this book. I saw a flyer at my local supermarket, and signed up immediately for her support group, where we were given a few typed chapters to read. The book really resonated with me, and I bought it as soon as it came out. However, I must say that those who are bordering on more severe sensitivity and/or clinical anxiety, panic disorders, etc. should be aware that their difficulties may exceed what is discussed in this book. I have been on and off medication for anxiety/social phobia for years. I am also an HSP, which I believe made me vunerable to developing these disorders in the first place. I found the book to be very validating, so much so in fact, that I bravely attended more meetings and even assisted Elaine personally with mailings of her newsletter. While the book was insightful, I found that I wasn't clicking with those in her groups. For them, high sensitivity became a banner to wave proudly, and a lifestyle to embrace. I knew then I had different concerns with my disorders. For me, and perhaps others like me, this book posed a danger. I sensed that HSP's who band together (the one's I met anyway) tended to have an &quot;Us vs. Them&quot; mentality, which may be healthier for higher functioning people. But labeling can also be isolating and alienate yourself from others. For me, because of my struggles with social phobia especially, I was isolated enough already from the mainstream. I didn't want to encourage even more isolationist tendencies in myself. In that way, this book was an &quot;enabler&quot;. The temptation was to shut down even more, using HSP as an excuse to avoid the very things I wished to be a part of. I'm not knocking this book, I have learned much about myself, but those with clinical disorders may need to be empowered differently at first. I would recommend &quot;Healing the Shame that Binds You&quot; to those people as well.
B000002JS6|5.0|Fresh off the death of original lead singer Bon Scott the Austrailian hard rockers put out what is widely considered their greatest album. Back in Black is an awesome album with killer tracks like hells bells, You shook me All night long and the title track especially is their (and therefor the world's) greatest song. The album has the raw sex, drugs, and rock n roll attitude of ACDC's golden age in the late '70's with an cd full of sweet rock. brian Johnson dosent have to be able to sing, anyone who could go out there and sceam their balls off would do it but he fits the style of AC/DC well.

Rent before you buy, and for hardcore fans, hope that eventually the true definitive version will be released ...
B00003CXQX|4.0|This is one of those Disney films that should actually be classed as a comedy rather than merely an animated children's movie.  It's basically about an arrogant emperor Kuzma who is turned into a llama by his evil advisor, Ysma and her dim-witted, butch right-hand man.  On his journey back to the palace to reclaim his crown, he befriends (grudgingly) by a local peasant whose village he had planned to destroy with his new swimming pool.<br />It's got plenty of jokes, wisely aiming them at several age groups.  For instance, there's plenty of visual jokes alongside the wittier asides intended for a more adult audience.  For instance, there's a wonderfully zany scene in which Yzma replaces a huge pinata and is beaten repeatedly by blindfolded young kids.  Obviously this will have everyone laughing.  Yet adults may well find themselves raising a smile at Kuzko's sarcasm, mocking tone and dry sense of humour.  Also great value is Yzma's sidekick, a kind of dimwitted butch geek.<br />Thankfully, the usual idealistic ideas of friendship that are often shoved down your throat in Disney movies aren't as inherent.  It's nice to have a hero that, to begin with at least, is cruel and nasty but very very funny.  All in all, this is a fantastic little film that marks a standout in Disney's usual fare.

But at the intensive we connected through all of the hurt and changed; we went from fighting with each other to fighting for each other. At the end of the intensive I remember describing my sense of where we had come from and where we were going. My family was ready to explode, and I had gotten my family back.<br />It is truly amazing to look back two years and realize the struggle from which we have come. We had lost contact with most of our friends; we had no social life, we were happiest when apart from each other, and had little hope for any long-term vision for our family other than cut our losses while we could. Leanne's assessment of my wife was \\"shut up and feed me.\\" Now, life is different than ever before. We have many friends; we have a social life, we are happiest when together. I have a new, great hope for our marriage and each of our children. It has been a hard, steady road of work and progress - in working with Leanne and wondering if we were getting anywhere. Then looking back to see how she was behaving better - that she has come through so much anger and rage to a place where she wants to care about people. She still is learning how to care about people in so many ways, but I believe that is a life-long process for all of us and she's only had two years of practice. My sons are closer to me than I could have imagined. They are now 9, 15 and almost 17 years old and they are all jealous of my time. <BR>Do we still have problems? You bet. Life happens to be full of friction and we get hurt. The key is now I have a way to help heal the hurts in my relationships.

B00003CXA2|1.0|There are actually 187 things in this film that bothered me, from the core concept right down to Forrest's haircut.  I don't have the space to list them all, but here are a few ways that this film insults its audience:<br />Historically.  The trivialization of major historical events into (already outdated) '90s \\"bites\\" is an unimaginative premise for a movie to say the least.  The pandering to baby boomers' sense of self-important nostalgia is as shrewd as it is nefarious.  They don't even have the guts to say the word \\"AIDS\\".  Jenny died of AIDS.  Didn't everyone who experimented with sex and drugs?<br />Philosophically.  Chuang Tzu is rolling in his grave.  The \\"go with the flow\\" tenets of Taoism have been poisoned by this awful film.  Gump's character doesn't question the world around him, and blindly does exactly as he's supposed to.  Let's all join the Flat Earth Society, or maybe we should just go back to being cavemen.<br />Emotionally.  As Forrest runs away from bullies, his leg braces dramatically break off!  This is just one of many examples of the film's \\"subtle\\" pulling of the old heartstrings.<br />Politically.  The film's treatment of the Vietnam War would be laughable if it wasn't so tragic.  Anyone that leans to the left is seen as being a woman-beating fanatic (i.e. the Black Panthers).  Blind patriotism can be a bad thing.  Ask Germany...<br />Musically.  The ham-fisted soundtrack only contains the most obvious, lowest common denominator tracks that everyone over the age of 7 has heard a billion times.  Also, can someone please, PLEASE make a movie that has a helicopter flying over Vietnam WITHOUT Creedence's \\"Fortunate Son\\" playing in the background?  Just once?!?<br />Intellectually.  It's well-known that it's easier to tempt a fly with honey than a flyswatter.  Tell people not to think, a la 1984, and they will resist.  Gently persuade them not to think by showing that you'll come out just fine if you follow orders, and you'll be much more successful.<br />Cinematically.  Poor character development.  Bad dialogue.  As far as the special effects go, I'm sure it took plenty of time and effort to put Gump on the Dick Cavett show or erase Lt. Dan's legs.  It would also take effort to watch someone balance a bowling ball on their nose.  Does that mean I want to see it?  <BR>It's as impressive and cutting-edge as Mr. Ed, the talking horse was in the '50s.<br />Financially.  I was lucky enough to have seen this movie for free.   Others have not been so fortunate.  Zemeckis & Co. know that the demographic with the most disposable income are baby boomers, and that if there's anything they like, it's a film that affirms how wonderful their generation was.  Bling bling!  What, do you think these people have never taken a marketing class?  Buy \\"Anaconda\\".  Donate to the Red Cross.  BURN $20 to keep warm!  Anything!  Just don't buy this movie!<br />This movie isn't funny, either.  Telling the President that you have to go to the bathroom?  And this movie won AWARDS?  Whatever potential Tom Hanks had with the old sit-com \\"Bosom Buddies\\" or the excellent movie \\"Bachelor Party\\" is gone.<br />In the future, will this movie be seen as a back-patting homage to a generation that sold out its ideals for a new SUV and a wide-screen TV?  Or a dangerous, subversive propoganda film AGAINST THOUGHT?  Time will tell.
B00005RYKU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Leelee Sobieski was a spectacular lead, and got great assistance from the rest of the cast. Truly, she is a great young talent in Hollywood.<br />I could not give it a five however, because there were some isolated incidents that I felt lacked creativity. Yet, I don't believe that it detracted from the movie enough to make it unenjoyable.<br />Ruby (Sobieski) and her brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan of &quot;The Patriot&quot;) are orphaned after a car accident claims their parent's lives. Ruby finds out that she and Rhett will be living with old family friends, the Glass'. But as they start settling in, she discovers that with the glamorous glass house in Malibu comes a nightmare that will endanger her and her brother's life.
B00000I8NC|4.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada (Kranky, 1999)<br /><br />Godspeed You Black Emperor! Have been around for a few years now, turning out classical-pop crossover  material in relative obscurity and building themselves a small but rabid fan base. The band's aversion to publicity of any sort (motivated not by affectation so much  as a deeply left-wing anarchic bent in the Montreal collective that spawned this nine-piece, who go so far as to not even reveal their last names in most cases)  has kept them from the audience they fully deserve for their style of music, especially in these days when Cecilia Bartoli is a superstar even in America and Sarah  Brightman and Michael Ball are cutting platinum records left and right. There is a great untapped market for pop-informed classical music, and that is exactly what GSYBE!  And their legion of spinoffs do. And they haven't done it anywhere any better to date than on the EP Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada.<br /><br />As with most GSYBE! releases, the number of tracks on the disc is small (two, in this case); unlike most  GSYBE! releases, the tracks aren't divided up into smaller pieces. \\"Moya\\" and \\"BBF3\\" are single, fully-realized long works. This has the effect of giving the EP a  greater feeling of unity then other GSYBE! discs; you know you're still listening to the same song at the end of the track that you were at the beginning.<br /><br />What makes the music stand out from the crowd, aside from the obvious conceit that very few pop bands use the  violin and cello as front-row instruments, is the band's incredible sense of dynamic. As with some of the best classical music, often the same phrase crops up  again and again in a piece, with only a change in dynamic to keep things fresh. And it never fails here. Everyone was hitting on all cylinders, and the result  is two glorious, majestic classical pieces of with more pop sensibility than can be found in any ten boy band producers put together.<br /><br />(Don't get me wrong, though. I'm not talking \\"Boston Pops\\" pop here, not by a longshot. I'm talking sexy,  aggressive, channeling-the-spirit-of-Robert-Johnson drum-and-bass manipulated-tape-loop Madonna-dreams-of-being-this-good pop.) **** ½/><br />(Don't get me wrong, though.

B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is definitely a very creepy film.  The movie tells the story of a brother and sister driving through the farmlands when they encounter a road rage maniac who is later witnessed dumping a body into a drainage pipe.  From that point on, its a chase to the end.  This movie is full of frights as well as characters you care about.  From the scene at the church to the ending at the police station, it keeps you glued to the screen.  Of course, there is the typical horror movie mistakes all characters make such as going back to investigate the body but hey, this is horror.  People in horror films do crazy stuff like that.  I don't honestly think a supernatural horror film can ever be completely believable but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of them.<br />Jeepers Creepers is a film that defies the usual cliche of everything turning out good in the end.  Its a frightening suspenseful ride all the way to the conclusion.  I loved it and I'm a big horror fan.
0446608955|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has two New York's time's bestseller books. He has been named as a leading author of today's best writers of love stories.<BR> I loved A Walk to Remember because it is a heart-warming novel of two opposites who attract each other. It contains an excellent mixture of feelings, I laughed, and cried with this book. Because Sparks adds small details to the story, I enjoyed this book. Friendship, love, death, and specially faith are some the feelings Sparks wrote about in this sticking piece of work. <BR>  Have you ever fallen in love, with the last person you could have imagined? <BR>A Walk to Remember unrolls an exquisite story of love in Beaufort, North Carolina in 1958. Landon, a teenager who is afraid to face manhood, had already dated a girl or two and thought he had once been in love. When homecoming arrives, he is left with the only option of taking lonesome Jamie Sullivan. Benevolent Jamie, daughter of the Prime minister, volunteer at the local orphanage, and helper of injured animals always carried a bible with her. <BR> Jamie pursued Landon to enter the year's Christmas play. Walking Jamie to her house, every day after the play's rehearsal, Landon and Jamie slowly open the doors to their hearts where a congenial friendship grows. <BR> On the night of the play, when the air was crisp and the sky was clear, Jamie looked like an angel and for the first time Landon admitted that she looked glamorous and spectacular. Since Jamie and Landon fall in love, together they discover that their faith is stronger than life itself, and it can fight against all the obstacles that they are faced with. <BR>I recommend this book to any anyone who is willing to understand challenges that life presents to us, and how faith is the only thing that can help us move on.  Never judge someone by first impressions, but always remember to take a deeper look.
0140288503|5.0|The subtitle of BLACK HAWK DOWN is &quot;A Story of Modern War,&quot; but it's much more than that.  This book is THE story of modern war, a blueprint for ground actions in the military theaters of tomorrow.  Bowden hammers away at the facts in the &quot;Battle of the Black Sea,&quot; and gives the reader an unvarnished depiction of what went right and what went wrong in Mogadishu, from the commanders to the men pulling the triggers.  If one didn't know this was an actual event, BLACK HAWK DOWN would read like a military thriller, with a compelling plot, vivid characters, and no end of combat heroism.  Whatever the leanings of the reader, whether hawk or dove, this book will inform and entertain from cover to cover.  It's that good of a read.
0679412719|4.0|The imperial saint, Marcus Aurelius, penned much of his \\"Mediations\\" late in his lifetime while fighting the infamous Macromannic Wars, and they are a reflection of his devotion to Zeus, philosophy, nature, the State, and life in general. He addressed the \\"Mediations\\"--which are written in Greek--to himself, and so the text has suffered at times due to careless composition; at times this causes his writings to appear awkward and grammatically flawed, though for the most part they are eloquent, poetic and full of wise sayings. To stress Aurelius deep knowledge of Greek philosophy, it most be noted that while he himself was committed the tenets of Stoic philosophy, his \\"Mediations\\" still contain elements of Platonism, and even Epicureanism as well. This work is a timeless classic and a must have.
B000002R68|4.0|At last mine again, after almost 3 years of search (this Burdon masterpiece has already been part of my vinyl collection in the 70's), it brought back all the sweet memories of the late sixties - only disturbed by some strange re-naming of tracks (psychedelic &quot;Orange and Red Beams&quot; replaced by the somewhat more material &quot;Oranges and Red Beans&quot;) and the lack of the original date of issue. No traces of remastering have been left on the CD - though this would have been a clear advantage.

0141301104|5.0|\\"The Witches\\" is an incredible novel that opens up people's imaginations. This book makes you travel into an extremely magical world where witches really exist! It is a brilliant and fascinating novel that grabs your attention from page 1!<BR> The adventure begins when this eight-year-old boy moves to live in with his grandmother in Norway because his parents were killed in a horrifying car accident. The little boy had always had a very close relationship with his grandmother, and now that they were living together they grew even closer to each other. Every night, the eight-year-old boy and his grandmother would sit in front of the fireplace where the boy's grandmother would always narrate  incredible stories. One night the boy's grandmother decided to tell the little boy the truth about real witches! Now, real witches don't wear silly black hats and fly on broomsticks. Real witches wear disguises! They do not have any hair, instead they wear wigs. They do not have toes either, but they hide their feet in their shoes. They also have weird looking nostrils. All of these witches are followers of the Grand High Witch, who is supreme authority. This Grand High Witch meets with all of the witches of the world by making meetings with all of the witches in every country once a year. In these meetings, the Grand High Witch gives the witches of the country she visits new ideas in which they can destroy every child in their country! These meetings were usually held in hotels and were disguised as charity projects. Of coarse, the eight-year-old boy was shocked when he heard this. Who wouldn't be? <BR> Well, any ways the real heart stopping adventure begins when the little boy and his grandmother decide to take a vacation to Bournemouth, England and they stayed at Hotel Magnificent. The eight-year-old boy and his grandmother were planning on having a great time in this vacation, but unfortunately this was impossible! Since they were unaware that the annual meeting in which theGrand High Witch visits all the witches in England was going to take place on the same hotel they were staying at, they were bound to have an incredible surprise that would fill them with horror.<BR>You don't want to miss this breath- taking story! It is a real page- turner filled with laughter and delight!
B00000HZFH|5.0|There are very few things in this world that I find miraculous.  The fact that this amazing band has recorded the two greatest albums in the history of rock, well, that is certainly one of them.<br />BTS's 1997 release, Perfect From Now On, is a slightly better record from start to finish, with it's eight musical epics blending seemlessly together to form one incredible symphonic masterpiece (think Darkside of the Moon, only with lyrics to match).<br />With Keep it like a Secret, BTS hits you much harder with each seperate song, so much so that it actually makes the album feel less cohesive than PFNO.  That being said, the isolated experience of each of the first nine songs is literally breathtaking.  I could write pages about the intense feeling and profound meaning I derive from the recordings on this album, but there is obviously not enough room.<br />Keep it Like a Secret has certain songs that are so intense, I feel like I'm going to pass out every time I listen.  No joke.<br />Here is a little of what I'm getting at. I hope these examples make sense to you:<br />&quot;Time Trap&quot; - The slow indroduction and development of a song's core sounds is always interesting to me (there is an entire genre of &quot;jam bands&quot; dedicated to the concept, such as Phish).  This song reminds me of how the pain of life's monotonous routines can really cause us harm.  It seems necessary to go through routines, yet at the same time, the routines seem to be what drain the life out of us.<br />&quot;Temporarily Blind&quot; - In the process of creating the most brilliant layers of sound structure I've ever heard, this song reminds me of the desperation of over-exposing your feelings and emotions to someone you love, in particular, to someone who will never love you in return.  This song feels like one of Shakespeare's tragedies.<br />&quot;Carry the Zero&quot; - The best rock song ever recorded, and I have heard much more than my share.  I like to use this song as a test todetermine whether a person is REALLY alive, or just going through the motions.  I've NEVER played this song for someone whom I was certain was a good person, and not have them love it.  Besides displaying the most stunning guitar work I have ever heard (think tighter, more structured Jimmy Hendrix, yes Jimmy), this song reminds me that the persuit of perfection is NOT NECESSARY.  People these days seem forget this simple fact.  After listening to this song for about the 100th time, a thought occurred to me, &quot;Maybe God is imperfect, and that is the very reason why none of us are perfect.&quot;  This is a rather peculiar thought, considering that I feel this song itself is as close to perfection as anything produced in our reality can be.<br />The only, and I mean ONLY problem with this album is the last track, &quot;Broken Chairs&quot;.  I've listened many times to every song on the eight BTS albums that I own, and this song is BY FAR the worst they have to offer.  It just plain sounds bad.  The only reason PFNO is the best rock album of all time, and not this album, is because of this last song.<br />Enough of my ramblings, just buy it, and maybe a few extras for the people you really care about.
B000008JUM|5.0|Frankly, I don't understand how a music lover could NOT like this album!  This is the 4th time I've had to buy it because I either wear the CD's or tapes out or lend it out &amp; never got it back.  I love the classic Cole Porter renditions - that's what I was familiar with.  As soon as I heard this album, though, I fell in love!  I love playing Dinah Washington's version of &quot;I've got you under my skin&quot; and then playing Nenah Cherry's rendition.  O.K., Dinah win's out for me on that one, but I still like to hear what Miss Cherry does to the song.  The same goes for Betty Carter's &quot;Every time we say goodbye&quot;.  Personally, I ADORE what Annie Lennox brings to that piece.  I makes me cry too!  Give this one a chance and keep your mind open!!
0440234743|4.0|In &quot;The Testament&quot; John Grisham writes, \\"Nate took a large spoonful of stew...then began the story...(he) went from chapter to chapter.\\"<br /><br /> That is how Grisham tells a story and why I, as a writer, chose to read it.  I wanted to study exactly how he tells his story, chapter by chapter.  One of my writing teachers from UCLA, Michael Levine, once said, \\"Grisham is a master at setting up scenes.\\" I am a master at taking good advice so I decided to check out his technique.<br /><br /> We all struggle with first chapters.  Grisham's is masterful.  He uses first person which was a bit of a surprise for a novel in which courtrooms and legal finagling are cornerstones.  But what a way to get up close and personal, to draw a reader in.<br /> In this chapter Grisham sets up an ideal legal situation, a ploy that sets the tone for the entire book. He also does something very daring.  He kills off the person from whose viewpoint the story is being told.  Yes, the first person narrator dies at the end of the first chapter leaving the reader wondering what the heck happened and how he is supposed to get from first chapter to last with his aging, recalcitrant first person storyteller dead and gone.<br /> Grisham is willing to do all of this in order to get the reader in a stranglehold and never let him go but he risks creating exactly the opposite effect.<br /><br /> In the second chapter Grisham jumps to the more usual third person and never returns.  This all works because, though Troy Phelan, the original narrator, has committed suicide, the entire book will still revolves around the machinations that he has set in motion and we still get the third person we have come to expect with this kind of story for the rest of the book.  Grisham took a risk when there was a benefit to doing so.<br /> I also liked that Grisham used symbols that were unobtrusive. Nate, the alcoholic protagonist who has seen way too much water flow under the bridge is out on the adventure of his lifetime and observes, behind his boat, \\"a view of the wake and the muddy brown water bubbling behind him.\\" Don't even suggest that this is accidental.  It is intended for sure, but it seeps into the reader's subconscious instead of smacking him between the eyes.<br /><br /> Grisham's work is not intended to be terrifically literary.  He is short on symbol, metaphor, and philosophy.  Some would argue that this is all to the good and it is certainly one of the reasons his scenes move along quickly.<br /><br /> Unlike some of my favorite authors (like John Updike) Grisham's vocabulary is very familiar.  It would be unlikely for a reader to find one word (I did; it was \\"scintilla\\") that he or she isn't absolutely sure about it.  I personally think there is nothing wrong with stretching the reader a bit and I don't think it necessarily slows down any but the most exacting of readers.  Grisham, I think, chooses not to do this in the interest of perfect scene structure and a fast-moving story.<br /><br /> I also find Grisham's work short on detail.  It is not because he can't do it.  In one place he notes that, \\"blood filled in the mortar cracks and ran in perfect right angles down a gentle slope.\\" Can't get more vivid than that.  I think he chooses not to use his gift for seeing detail in order to keep his chapters and scenes moving along.  One is sacrificed for the other.  Which you choose, as a writer, depends on what you are trying to do.<br /> It's pretty much the same when making a choice as a reader.  What do you want more?  A fast moving story or something to chew on for years to come?  Choices. Choices.  It's all about choices.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"f his lifetime and observes, behind his boat, \\"a view of the wake and the muddy brown water bubbling behind him.\\" Don't even suggest that this is accidental.

B00005QATY|5.0|You don't necessarily need to enjoy bluegrass, but it sure don't hurt because some of the finest bluegrass in the world is probably heard in this video.  Norman Blake does a terrific rendition of &quot;You Are My Sunshine,&quot; and you'll find a real &quot;old timey&quot; sound coming from The Whites, The Cox Family, Allison Krauss, and other Newgrass artists.  The movie is charming, gutsy, and hugely entertaining.  George Clooney-- who happens to look remarkably like Clark Gable in this movie-- shows his talent for the comedic in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill, the smooth talker in the trio of escapees fleeing a chain gang in 1920s Mississippi.  Adventures, escapades, and political predicaments follow hot on their recently-freed heels, and all of it is accompanied with unforgettable music.  Buy the soundtrack if, for nothing else, the &quot;Soggy Bottom Boys'&quot; rendition of 'Man of Constant Sorrow.'  O Brother is a treasure.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I don't see how any music fan can give this album a rating of anything less than 5. Ryan Adams is a songwriting genius, show REAL emotion. (Unlike some popular artists today, ahem! cough!, Creed!) This album shows some great feelings of true american spirit, and only the genius of alternative country legends Whiskeytown can pull this off. You can really tell how hard Ryan Adams worked on this album. Some artists after they become really popular start focussing less on great music and more on how much albums they'll sell and how much radio play they get. Hey Ryan, my man, keep working hard, my friend. Peace.

068485015X|5.0|M. Scott Peck's brilliant description of the human condition is the uber-self-help book.  If you want to know why the world today (and twenty some-odd years ago when the book was written) is awash with narcisists, liers, responsibility shirkers, loveless relationships, and instant gratification consumers, this is the book for you.  And yes, you will find that you exhibit some symptoms of every problem he describes.  But how do we combat our own weakness?  He explains all.  As Dr. Peck says (paraphrased), &quot;Why do people lie?  To avoid pain.&quot;  Simply stated and direct, he writes with a style that exposes the elephant in the room.  Every person owes it to themselves to read this book and look in the mirror.  This book is not a substitute for therapy, or a spiritual guide.  This book is an eye opener, to show you the way towards a healthy mind and spirit...hence the title.  Highly recommended.
B00005ARDC|3.0|Like the Strokes, B.R.M.C. suffers from an overdose of hype. I mean, really, what this trio does isn't new - the Jesus & Mary Chain has done this already, and better, on the (woefully out of print in the U.S.) Psychocandy and Darklands. That said, there isn't anybody else doing dark, semi-erotic distortopop - even the Chain gave it up long before they disbanded - and B.R.M.C. does it well. If you yearn for the days when \\"Happy When It Rains\\" got regular play on your local college radio station, you'll find this record a refreshing listen.
B000059ZLH|4.0|Mike Portnoy may be the world's best drummer, but he's no film director.<br />What could have been the greatest DVD of a band ever released turned out to be a throw-back to the cheesy edits and &quot;direction&quot; prevalent in the '60s. Multiple images on screen. Blurs. Fades. Colors. You know. The stuff you'd see in a Flower Power gig at the Fillmore.<br />Why he had to do that, I don't know. The concert and music itself would have been enough. In fact, it would have been far more than we deserved.<br />The music on Metropolis 2000 is flawless. In fact, it's astounding. It's their entire Scenes From a Memory album performed live. The sound quality is excellent. For the most part, the picture quality is, too.<br />But I found myself wishing there were fewer visual enhancements and &quot;artistic&quot; augmentations. There aren't many of them now (thank God!), but what's there is annoying.<br />If you're a fan of DT (as I am) you can overlook these flights of fancy on Portnoy's part. If you're new to DT and want to see what the band is all about, you probably won't even notice them. <br />The bottom line: This is a great DVD from a superb band. If you overlook the extravagances in editing/&quot;direction,&quot; you'll discover an incredible musical experience you'll watch again and again.

B0000508U6|5.0|This music is perfect to lean back, listen to, and let go.<BR>With a vocal sound similar to some of Radiohead's works - toned down, obviously - it's a type of music there simply isn't enough of.<BR>A few notes in &quot;High Speed&quot; are reminescent of Pearl Jam's &quot;Jeremy&quot;, but Coldplay is much more laid down.<BR>&quot;Don't Panic&quot; is a perfectly flawless, chilling song, while the two hits &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; give the album a superb median. &quot;We Never Change&quot; is also a relaxing addition. In fact, this is the kind of CD you can listen all the way through without once getting tired of the style.<BR>I applaud Coldplay's works, and look forward to their next release.
B00005UKE0|5.0|I was just 13 when this LP was first released and it was the most special Christmas present I received that year. Now I'm 45 and after revisiting the record I am astounded that I didn't recognize just what a wonderful work this was.<br />Don't misunderstand - I liked the LP but I had forgotten it over the years. George's passing brought me back and now I have found music that is undoubtedly the best of the after-Beatles efforts.<br />The sheer joy and inspiration of \\"Awaiting on You All\\" is worth the price of the CD. Then there is the haunting beauty of \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and the majestic irony of \\"Art of Dying\\". What stands out, first and foremost, is the essential nature of George Harrison.<br />This music exudes the gentle humor, grace and resolve of a man that I would have dearly loved to meet. You get the sense of the man from this music - the joy, the cynicism, the band of friends he surrounded himself with.<br />This CD is moving, haunting and it burrows down into your soul - the way truly great music should. What a pity artists like George Harrison and Ronnie Lane are underestimated and underappreciated while they are alive.
B00005LOUS|3.0|Although I throughly enjoyed the \\"new\\" Grinch movie...I still get more of a kick out of the cartoon original! The initial part of the movie was interesting and gave a new twist to why the Grinch was Grinchy (the Grinch is thwarted in love and made fun of by school mates).  The relationship that develops with Cindy Lou who is really quite brillant...the special effects and costumes are great, and Mr. Carrey is excellent along with rest of the cast...I'm still not out my childhood yet apparently!  I love the cartoon antics, the extreme facial expressions on the cartoon Grinch and side kick dog!  Thus my rating!
B00005O3VC|3.0|I am downgrading my rating of the Special Edition DVD because of the fact that subtitles switch themselves on at scene changes, seriously disrupting the flow of the film. If Gsuscryst or someone else could just give some links as text - they don't have to be live - to any Sony site which offers exchanges, postage-paid or not, please reply to this review.  I have been right through cthe.com looking for an admission of the tech problems - no dice.
B000009QPE|5.0|Hands down, this is the best album to come out of the thrash genre of the late 80's. <BR>Some may complain that it's only 30 minutes long, but really, this CD contains a good 2 hours worth of great riffs; they're just played so fast and furiously that it clocks in at a half hour.<BR>This was Rick Rubin's first production with the band, and just by listening to their previous recordings, you can tell how much he was able to harness their sound into a manic fury. Where the earlier records suffer from that echoey, early 80's generic metal production, Rubin whacks everything up front and center.  The sound is crystal clear and uncluttered. No gimmicks here,just in your face raging guitars and manic drumming. Tom Araya sounds like he's practically bellowing in your ear. Reign In Blood is bookended by 2 of Slayer's greatest songs: Angel Of Death (featuring Dave Lombardo's astonishing double foot pedal drum break) and Raining Blood, which has one of the most neck-snapping riffs ever. The guitar solos are typical Slayer noisefests, but fit perfectly with the mania of the music. Most of the time it feels like the songs are going to careen out of control into noise, but the band always harnesses it back in in the nick of time with a great bludgening riff or a blinding drum break.<BR>Warning :This is not for the faint of heart. The lyrics would probably kill Tipper Gore before she was 5 minutes into it. If you are easily offended, stick with some happy metal band like Bon Jovi or something. Otherwise, pick this up, and move the furniture out of the way. You may need some room before it's all over.

B00005Q45W|5.0|Well, it's Leonard Cohen, isn't it?  Need I say anymore?  One of the most original voices in the world, with a beautifully jaundiced eye.  Snatch this one up.
B00005RJ1U|1.0|let alone learn how to drive?  That is whatI wnat to know.....somehow don't think this character would be that inconspicuous at the local DMV.  This movie really makes no sense.  As many other reviewers have stated, there were such possiblilities available during the first oooooo 10 minutes or so of the movie but they were quickly blown by bad writing, bad acting, and nonsensical plot twists that just left me alternatively shaking my head and balancing my checkbook (NOW that's scary!)  Dull, stupid, and a non-ending which is blatantly left open for a sequel  --- which for obvious reasons would only be hghlighting Gina Philips lack of talent; reason enough to avoid JC II.  Avoid this movie!
B00005TT77|4.0|I, like I suspect most, of the million or so people who will see the film \\"I Am Sam\\" do not label myself a \\"Beatles Fan.\\"  Do I like a lot, if not most, of the Beatles songs...sure.  I think I even own one or two of their original albums.  This SOUNDTRACK album has some great versions of very enjoyable songs.  I liked it.  My wife liked it.  My 2 and 4 year old sons liked it.  They also liked \\"Beatles One\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love: Beatles Songs for Kids\\".  Interestingly, whenever an album comes out that contains tracks written and performed previously by the Beatles, died in the wool \\"Beatles Fans\\" jump all over the review boards with poo-poo reviews.  What a crock!  I seriously doubt that the intention of the artists or producers was to \\"capture any of the emotion, spirit or uniqueness of the originals\\" as one such Beatles fan/moron stated.  This album was designed to capture the emotion and spirit of the MOVIE - I Am Sam...which I hope to see next week and fully expect will be fabulous...in part thanks to these very tender and emotional songs which (it is my understanding) were a very real part of the character Sam's identity.  If you are some crazy \\"Beatles Fan\\" awaiting John or George to return from the dead (much like the million or so Elvis freaks with subscriptions to the Weekly World News), not only don't buy this album (because no Beatles renditions will ever give your demented little minds any pleasure) but don't discourage others away from an album that is uplifting and a pleasure to listen to.  I didn't like this album because the songs were Beatles songs, I liked it because I enjoyed listening to it...in my opinion a much truer test of a good album.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I really enjoyed the orginal Jurrasic Park. I felt it was about time a really good dinosaur movie was made. When the second movie came out I was not as impressed having a great movie just been done. However, this third movie kept me at the edge of my seat the entire movie. One complaint I have is that a certain times in the movie, the dialogue is so soft I was increasing the volume control to heard what was being said. Then the animals would appear and the volume was much too loud. You would think that the film people would have a solution for this. This aside, I very much enjoyed this movie....
B00005LQ04|4.0|Everyone else talks about this movie being a ground-breaker, and it is.  The first 10 minutes are so incredibly tense Argento had to relax up a bit after that or anyone watch would die from a visually induced stroke.  OK, maybe not, but still, those first ten minutes are incredible.  Now for my complaints.  This didn't need to be a 3 disc set.  The movie is short enough the 52 minute documentary could easily have fit on the same disc, plus, there's no commentary track.  There's one on Tenebre and Phenomena, but not here.  The 3rd disc is the soundtrack, and it is right up there with the Exorcist and the Omen for best Horror film ST's ever.  The music video on this DVD is worthless though (I much prefer Bill Wyman's on Phenomena.  At least that had something to do with the movie.  So my complaints are more than made up for by the movie itself.  Plus, I've always had a crush on Jessica Harper.
B00004TRD8|4.0|Sure, Terminator 2 might be more technologically advanced than the first one as well as longer and has more action but for some reason the first one catches my eye more and seduces me more. The 2nd one starts 10 years after the first terminator came back to kill Sarah Conner but failed, the 2nd terminator was sent to kill John when he was only ten years old, however this was a T-1000, an advanced Terminator that can copy and imitate anything it touches. As in the first a protector is sent, the T-800, the same model as the first terminator who is kinder and gentler in this movie.  The reason the first terminator is better is because the humans don't stand a chance against the Terminator, it's a cyborg and they can't kill it, two Terminators fighting each other gives away the ending of the 2nd movie.  the sound mix is alright but the way the widescreen picture is set up isn't as amazing as the first terminator movie.  I was kinda left disappointed but I did enjoy the movie a great deal, but today it's not as amazing, it's just too serious and tries to be better than the first movie, most sequels don't try to surpass the original but extend the story.  But anyways, the picture quality is good and the sound mix isn't too shabby, the DVD menu is kind of hard to navigate through and the documentaries are more about interviews but not actually shooting scenes and how they came about or what they used to make them. Why I give this DVD 4 stars is the fact that it's the terminator and was also one of the first rated r movies I ever watched and to this day still makes me guilty because I know I should have not watched it because I wasn't supposed to, oh well, can't change the past can you?
B000000W5P|1.0|Don't get me wrong!  I like the Rolling Stones, but to me they're more of a \\"singles\\" band than an \\"album\\" band.  They've written some of the greatest rock & roll songs ever like \\"Brown Sugar,\\" \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" and (of course) \\"Satisfaction.\\"  But in my opinion, the Stones have only crafted one truly great album (1971's STICKY FINGERS) and all of the other albums I heard by them seem to be hit-and-miss.  And 1978's SOME GIRLS displays my theory perfectly.<br />The Rolling Stones are WAY more talented than the likes of Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, but SOME GIRLS is unquestionably one of the worst rock records ever made.  Why did they even make this album?  It seemed as if they were trying to make their bluesy sound more commercial so people can realize that they're still around, but every experiment to try a different style on SOME GIRLS falls flat every time.<br />The only song I like is the raunchy title track \\"Some Girls,\\" which is vintage Stones.  Mick Jagger's lyrics toy with his celebrity status as he discusses how far groupies are willing to go to sleep with their rock icon.  Keith Richards' main riff expertly complements the sheer machismo of the song.  Besides that, it's all downhill from there!!<br />\\"Lies\\" and \\"Respectable\\" are awful, pathetic attempts at doing punk rock, while \\"Far Away Eyes\\" is a country-tinged song that sounds tired and cliched.  The cover of \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\\" is very uneven since Jagger isn't as good a singer as the R&B singer who wrote it, but it's a hell of a lot better than Keith Richards' whiny and annoying singing spot \\"Before They Make Me Run.\\"  The guitars are so loud during \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" that I can barely hear the drums, bass, and Jagger.<br />I bought SOME GIRLS back in May of 2001, and I've only listened to it three times and it's been sitting on my record shelf ever since.  But the aggravated feelings I get just thinking about it make me want to vomit!
B00005QFE5|5.0|The true love story and beautiful scenary shots. No wonder it was directed by Zhang, Yimou, the best director in China, who was originally studied Cinamic Choreagraphy (poor spelling?) then later became actor and director. I seldom was moved to tears by any movies, being a man, but not for this one, I have watched many times, each time was fascinated and attracted by the colorful landscape and beautiful actress Zhang, Ziyi.<BR>Here is the Time Asia Magazine exclusive interview about Yimou and Ziyi's new movie, \\"Hero\\" with other superstars, Jet Li, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung. You won't see it before the geginning of next year. But I bet it will be another smash hit in the world. (...)<BR>It was a cover story and iterviews with all the major casts and directors. The following is the pasted interviews about Ziyi by Yimou: <BR>Time: You told us that Zhang Ziyi feels a lot broader to you as an actress than she did when you were working on The Road Home with her. Does she now give you that same sense of being able to wrap a scene in one or two takes that you talked about with regard to Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung? Or does she still need a lot more cajoling to achieve the kind of performance you want? <BR>Zhang: On this film, she's almost there. In the past, I had to spend a lot of time talking through each shot with her. Now she catches on much more quickly. Of course, she doesn't have the variety of experience of Tony or Maggie. She's still young. But she's got the ability. <BR>Time: Do you think that's a function of her increased familiarity with your demands on her as an actress? Is it that she simply has a better sense of what you want from her in a performance? <BR>Zhang Yimou: Partially, yes. But it's just as much to do with the development of her craft as an actress. I'll give you an example. When we were making The Road Home, there were several times in the film when she needed to cry. And as far as I was concerned these were crucially important parts of the movie. I'd call for quiet on the set. There had to be total silence, because crying in front of so many people is not easy. I knew we could only do one take. The lights, the film, everything had to be perfect, because I was afraid that on the second or third takes the tears wouldn't come, or the acting wouldn't seem sincere. But on this film, she's been amazing. We have technical problems all time. There's always one reason or another to re-shoot the scene. We're doing five or six takes for every shot. And she cries on command. It only takes her a few seconds to get in and out of character. It has surprised and impressed me. This is real change in Ziyi's acting. Now if I have to shoot her crying, I'm not afraid of shooting multiple takes, because there's always a possibility that the last take will be the best one. Maggie's got the same talent. And I've caught Ziyi studying her performance very intently. It's a smart move. There's a lot Maggie can teach her.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This movie is just fun.  I remember going to see thing thing when I was 10.  I liked it then I like it now, good family movie.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This sweet and less well-known film is the very best of all the Austen re-creations done in the last ten years.  Unlike Sense and Sensibility, which introduced 20th-century comic schtick that would have appalled Jane Austen and any other person of her era, Persuasion moves at a slower and more subtle pace.  The casting is perfect and nothing is prettified--this is the real Regency period, not a fantasy coloring book.  Absolutely outstanding--one of the best evocations of a book on screen ever done, second only to Howards End.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Make no mistake, this is a masterful album, but it is Leonard Cohen with a difference. He has pared away a great deal, including a great deal that his fans have always loved: most of the lush and startling imagery, the intense eroticism, the smoldering anger at the world's ingrained injustice, most of the irony, and the artistic ethic which had always prized unslakable longing as the compass directing us to what is beautiful and sacred.<br />Those things are largely incompatible with serious Zen practice, and this album makes it clear that Cohen's practice has been serious. There's a phrase for people who throw themselves into meditation and come out with a taste of enlightenment and a jargon-heavy religious vocabulary; the roshis say that they have \\"the stench of Zen.\\" There's none of that neophyte heavy handedness here. When Cohen wryly observes \\"I fought against the bottle, but I had to do it drunk,\\" he is offering a classic koan about the impossible job of Buddhism - using our unenlightened desire for enlightenment to eliminate desire itself. When he continues, \\"I took my diamond to the pawnshop, but that don't make it junk,\\" it's a reference to a major Mahayana scripture, the Diamond Sutra. His unpretentious images get it all across effortlessly, whether the listener is familiar with such esoterica or not.<br />I'm glad there's no stench of Zen. What I miss here is the \\"stench of Leonard.\\" But the man has moved on. He has achieved a kind of peace with himself, one which seems bleak on one listening and comforting on another. These ten new songs exhibit a relentless honesty, in a voice that speaks to us from the other side of a vast gulf we feel we too may have to cross. Again and again, they manage the trick of both renouncing all the highs and lows of life and accepting them. <br />My favorites are 'Love Itself', a journey past the edge of the universe and back; 'By the Rivers Dark', a harrowing sequel to the 137th psalm; and two songs that, if you'll pardon the oxymoron, are heartbreaking in their objectivity: 'Here It Is' and 'Leaving Alexandra.'  But ask me again after the next two dozen plays.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I watched this movie with my 16 year old son, a fairly new driver.  Predictably, he loved it and I hated it.<br />If the movie was intended as a vehicle (pun intended) for watching teens race customized rice rockets then I guess it succeeded.  However, it failed on just about every other level - little intelligible or creditable plot (just how DID those kids afford the incredibly expensive bolt on go-faster products?), zero character development beyond the cartoon-like stereotypical goodies and baddies bound together (loosely) with literally laughable posturing and dialogue, corny visual set pieces with cars driving round the streets in jet-fighter like formation. At several points in the movie I had to suppress guffaws so as to not spoil the movie for my son.  The entire project felt like it was written from a high-schooler's perspective of what is 'awesome'.<br />Additionally, the soundtrack on the DVD was all over the place.  There was no consistency of volume at all, the sound had to be turned up for dialogue and then the music came in at mind-numbing volume resulting in a mad fumble for the remote control.<br />So, if you are under 20 and want to see a movie about other kids with fast cars then sure, go get The Fast and the Furious. If you are over 20 (or are a mature 18) and you want a car chase within the context of a plausible movie, get Steve McQueen's Bullitt or even The Driver with Ryan O'Neil. Darn, even Gone in 60 Seconds was better than this drivel.
B0000524E5|5.0|Yes, you can say that the story is not the best...however, I must confess that I really loved the way Piper plays its role. I just saw this movie for 3 times now, and I would still like to see it once again. <BR>In my opinion it's funny and has some romance on it (despite being a simple movie). I'm still trying to understand why, but the fact is that I really enjoyed the movie...just watch it!<BR>As I said in the title, Piper is great. Just hope that she gets the chance to play with some really talented actors like Robert De Niro or Al Pacino. That would really make her a super-star (in my opinion, she's already a star :) )
B0000524E5|5.0|Yes, one can say that the story is a little lame...however, Piper transforms it into a great movie: how, you may ask...well, easy: by giving us a great performance (really  really good one, I think)...I hadn't seen her before, but I can assure you all that in the future I will pay attention and look for her name (in the actors list): is it's in it, then I'll surelly see the movie! <BR>So, I'll just wrap it up by saying that coyote ugly is a good funny movie. If you don't believe me, just watch it, will you?
0375805613|5.0|I used to have this book when I was a little girl and I bought it for my two boys who are now older and have since gotten rid of it, and I LOVE THIS BOOK!  It was my favorite as a child, it was my older boys' favorite, and now I've had a baby and I want it to be his favorite too!!  Grover is just so silly and cute in this story that you just have to LOVE him!!  Everytime I read it, I laugh and giggle because it is just too silly!!  It is a definite must have for any child out there!  Grover leads you all the way through the whole book telling about this scary monster at the end of the book and how frightened he is, and then ...  well for those of you who haven't read it I don't want to ruin it for you...heheheh!  Enjoy!

B00003W8NO|5.0|\\"Toy Story\\" is a modern fairy tale created with appropriately modern computer animation. Its snappy dialougue will appeal to adult viewers, the spectacle of fantastic toys coming to life will appeal to children, and adults may wax nostalgic about the toys they enjoyed as children, several of which are featured in this movie.<BR> The story revolves around a cowboy doll named Woody, and his imminent replacement as the favorite toy of his owner, Andy, by Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll, a multigadgeted gift that Andy receives for his birthday.<BR> Tom Hanks'personality shines through in the persona of Woody, and Tim Allen's voice lends the right amount of charisma to Buzz. <BR> In the process of forming an eventual friendship, the characters go through a lot of antagonism and a lot of other real human emotions. As they prepare for life in a new home, they are imperiled by the sadistic kid next door named Sid, into whose clutches they fall by accident.<BR> It's entertaining to watch the toys interact with each other.<BR> Buzz gradually learns that he is simply a child's plaything and not the noble space crusader he fancied himself to be in the beginning, and Woody learns to share his special place in Andy's heart. A great supporting cast including Annie Potts as Woody's sweetheart, Bo Peep, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as Slinky, Wallace Shawn as Rex, John Ratzenburger as Ham, and Laurie Metcalfe as Andy's mother help fuel this tale.<BR> Seeing this innovative film made me want to buy dolls of Woody and Buzz as collector's items. But I am content with just a copy of this movie. The second installment of the \\"Toy Story\\" saga is an enhancement of the first one, and just like the first, nothing short of delightful.
B000002UJQ|2.0|I don't get it yet. I've listened a couple times to this album and it really seems like a wash. People are putting it in the category of other great works, but for me, you've got to have that something more then this has - maybe emotion, maybe coherence...
B00003CX7L|5.0|This second installment of the \\"Toy Story\\" saga is an improvement on the first one because the animation is better. The movements of the humans in the story are more fluid and natural and the story of friendship, loyalty, and deciding where one really belongs is one with which we can all identify.<BR> We find little Andy Davis, his Mom, and little sister, Molly, comfortably settled into the house to which they moved in the original \\"Toy Story\\". Andy is a little older, and the physical appearance of the human characters has changed a little bit.<BR> Happily, we see that Woody The Cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks)still has a special place in Andy's heart despite his earlier displacement by the arrival of Buzz Lightyear. Andy still enjoys taking Woody to Cowboy Camp during the summer. But this time, the plans are altered by Woody's being slightly damaged.<BR> At the same time, Andy's Mom decides to have a yard sale. When she takes Wheezy the Penguin down for the sale, Woody is stolen by a dishonest toy store owner as he attempts to save Wheezy.<BR> As Andy's toys attempt to track down Woody's whereabouts before Andy returns from camp, Woody learns of his own history as the star of a 1950s children's show, and is greeted by an aggressive but friendly yodeling cowgirl named Jessie,voiced by Joan Cusack a prospector doll who has never been out of his box, voiced by a dour Kelsey Grammar, and an awkward but adorably sweet horse named Bullseye.<BR> The seach through the toy store is funny, especially when tour Guide Barbie points out, in reference to the Buzz Lightyear dolls, how \\"in 1995,shortsighted retailers did not order enough dolls to meet demand\\". Presumably, that incident is based on real life.<BR> There is a poignancy to this story when we learn that Jessie once had a home, and that she hasn't been owned by a child in more than 30 years. The story of Jessie's brief time with her owner is beautifully enacted through music.<BR> Complications ensue during Buzz's rescue attempt on behalf of Woody, and the objectives of the members of Woody's Roundup Gang<BR>begin to differ. <BR> Eventually, all turns out well, and this story provides a morality tale about dishonesty when, instead of ending of with rare dolls to send to a museum in Japan, Al ends up with no Round-Up gang members at all, and the child whose heart might have been broken by Al's greed and dishonesty ends up with two new friends to play with.<BR> It's fun to watch the toy ensemble at the end enjoying a musical number by Wheezy. All in all, it's a cleverly written story with great animation. A masterpiece from the crew of Pixar!
B0000524CY|5.0|This movie is about a twelve year old girl named Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) who starts to act strangly.  Her mother, Chris (Ellen Burstyn) takes her to different doctors day by day and do numerous tests on her (spinal taps...etc.).  They find out that nothing is medically wrong with her and consult her to find a priest.  Since Chris is not a big religious person, she goes to a Jesuit priest, Damien Karras (Jason Miller).  He tells Chris that her daughter is possessed by an evil force and needs to have an exorcism.  After seeing \\"Help Me\\" on her stomach, he pleads to the Catholic Church to approve of the exorcism.  Father Merrin helps Damien proceed in the exorcism as Regan's body starts to turn into a demonically figure.  When they find out it's a demon named Pazuzu (Mercedes McCambridge) who is possessing Regan, Father Merrin starts to doubt his fight for her life as Damien starts to doubt his faith.  As the demon takes full control of Regan, the exorcism starts to go downhill.  Father Merrin and the demon have already fought once before and Pazuzu now knows all of Father Merrin's weaknesses.  Pazuzu ends up killing Father Merrin and now Damien is on his own for the fight.  When he sees there is nothing else to do, he tells the demon to come into him.  And he does, then after fighting within hisself and the demon, the demon throws him out the window and he dies.  Now Regan is freed from the evil force of Satan....or is she????
0451191153|5.0|I first read this book as a philosophy student and was immediately ostracized by student and faculty alike when I attempted to ask questions about why Ayn Rand was not included in discussions about modern philosophers or American philosophers.<br />I remember the puzzled look on the face of my philosopher teacher in our American Philosophers course when I brought up her name. He completely ignored me and pretended as though I were a ghost for the rest of the term. And I was previously one of his favorite students. I am not sure if they fear her, misunderstand her, or simply despise her, but I think that a scholarly examination of her body of work is long overdue. And this book is the beginning of Ayn Rand as a serious thinker with an important message.<br />I fell in love with this book from the first page and did not stop reading it unless I was eating, sleeping or in class. The characters overwhelmed me, the writing blew me away and the ideas gave me hope. I had first heard about Rand from Rush Limbaugh's radio show, where he talked about disagreeing with Rand because of her atheism and her pro-choice stance. I knew I had to read this author because I hated the religious elements of Rush's show.<br />&quot;Howard Roark laughed.&quot; From those words I was literally hooked. I had no idea what was coming next, but i knew that these were just the ideas and words I needed to hear. I had been thinking them for so long already, it was about time I finally felt someone I could relate to, and who had something intelligent to say in philosophy that was completely incoherent.<br />Read this book and try to remember the hope you had as a teenager, when the world was clean and open to any possibility. That is the world these characters live in every day. I re-read this book often just to enjoy the sense of life that she created. It permeates every page and nuance of this book. Its a sense of life where you are the master of your own destiny, where anything is possible. The climax is powerful and the conclusion uplifting, just like life shoudl be.limax is powerful and the conclusion uplifting, just like life shoudl be.
0375704027|5.0|Norwegian Wood is easily the best thing Haruki Murakami has ever written. It is so beautiful and poetic, so rich in emotions and realism, so touching and so haunting. The story of a man choosing between a love of his past and a love of his future, Norwegian Wood carries a tremendous wave of emotions in such subtle and simple prose. That is the gift of Murakami; the music of his words. Beautiful and rich, his novels are always exercises in minimalist literature - Norwegian Wood is no different. Each passage in the novel trembles with symbolic possibility, adding to the emotions already stirred by his characters, who are, as constructed by Murakami, afloat in a world devoid of a point or purpose. They live with death, with loss and with idiosyncratic problems; they must also, however, live in a world crazier than themselves. It is established in the novel that a mental rest home is saner than the outside world. Perhaps the best way to describe this novel is as a bleak, tragic love story mixed with black comedy. For its entirety it travels smoothly and easily, becoming increasingly more intriguing and compelling, right up until the devastating denouement.
B000002J0B|5.0|As the music industry keeps getting worse and worse, I always go back to albums like these. It's such a shame that the music industry is more strict lately, where back then they didn't care. Led Zeppelin is a excellent group that didn't have limitations and have endless talent. They are truly a godsend. That's why I reccomend this. Thank you.
B00005TT77|1.0|I have heard many wonderful interpretations of the Beatles over the years; some I have liked better than the originals.  I'm not a purist, who believes no one can do it better than the Beatles.  But most of this is awful, especially the &quot;interpretations&quot; mentioned in other reviews.  These folks just didn't have a clue what the music is  about.  After listening to the soundtrack, I will not sit through the movie.
0385505833|4.0|This is a fun book with a sweet ending.  It was easy to read and made me laugh.  It would be a great movie.  It pokes fun at our societal norms, but still sends across the real meaning of Christmas.  Loved it!  I recommended it to my friends.
0790750627|5.0|Wedged between two exercises in the psychosexual (\\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Psycho\\"), Alfred Hitchcock made a truly entertaining chase flick. \\"North by Northwest\\" features a cross-country joy ride of familiar landmarks as Cary Grant's \\"Roger Thornhill\\" tries to elude both the henchmen of James Mason (SUPERB!) and our own government (headed by Hitchcock stalwart Leo G. Carroll). Eva Marie-Saint, though not as alluring as other Hitchcock \\"blonds\\" adds the right blend of mystery and sex appeal to her character. Martin Landau, in an early role, is featured as Leonard, Mason's right-hand man.<br /><br />The movie also sports a brilliantly exciting Bernard Herrmann score.<br /><br />So, set your travel plans to include a trip \\"North by Northwest.\\"
B00005QZWJ|5.0|After seeing this film a 2nd time (out of 4!), I realized that quite a lot of its incredible effect<BR>upon me was due to the score.  The melody of the Shire is captivating no matter<BR>how often you hear it, and Shore's orchestrations are masterful.  Noting that he had previously<BR>worked on (what I at least consider to be) &quot;junk&quot; films like Cronenberg's, I was gloriously<BR>surprised at his ability to create something beautiful and noble enough to enhance The<BR>Lord of the Rings.  As Cora says to Hawkeye in &quot;Last of the Mohicans,&quot; this score is<BR>&quot;stirring to my blood.&quot;  I can't wait for the complete soundtrack to be released.  The<BR>piano arrangement is due out soon, as well.  Enya's &quot;May It Be&quot; is one of the most<BR>lovely, memorable songs I have ever heard.  Wagner aficionados will also be thrilled by<BR>the many Wagnerian leitmotivs here, as in the &quot;Great River&quot; sequence as the companions<BR>pass the colossi of the warrior-kings.
0441008356|1.0|This book was probably the worst book I have ever read. It jumps from one time frame to another with no apparent order. There are so many flashbacks, it becomes very confusing. It offers you glimpses into explaining the story but never actually achieves it. When you finish reading it, you are left wondering what it was all about. It promised so much and delivered so very little.
B00005RFAI|4.0|In this latest from Pink we see her sing more rock with catchy pop hooks .But there  is still some R&amp;b influence . Over all I liked this album I didn't give it 5 STARS ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE OVER PLAYING HER FIRST SINGLE WAY TO MUCH THEY NEED TO STAR PLAYING MORE SINGLES mISUNDERSTOOD AND DEAR DIARY.

6303269842|5.0|For sure one of the best comedies ever made.  The stars are all great, but some of the most memorable scenes in my mind came from the guest appearances of Graham Greene (as the indian chief) and James Coburn (as the commodore).<br />This definitely a movie you would want to watch over and over again!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The movie was spectacular spectacular! Nicole Kidman is a Prostitute who falls in love and sings all about it with co-star Ewan McGregor. A musical romance with theatrical comedy. I gave this movie 5 stars because it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made want to watch it again and again. It's a great movie please see at least once for you're sakes.

B00005N9CV|3.0|I am the proud dutch owner of 4 former Diana Kral cd's which I all Like for a different purpose; Love Scenes,All for you,Only trust yout heart and When I look in your eyes.<BR>I had great expectations when I orderd this cd, but it is a bit dissapointing. I think only one word tranlates my feeling after hearing this cd. 'FLAT'. You put it in your player and after 10 tracks it's silent in my room again and I can't remember what I heard before!, for this kind of easy listening I rather stap into an elevator. Diana You can do much better!
B00004XQP4|1.0|Last year, I heard my nephew playing some grating, whiny music about 'moral majority', and I then asked him who the band was.  He then proudly exclaimed, \\"Billie Joe\\".  I looked puzzled (I thought that was the band's name).  My nephew went on to say, \\"Billie from Green Day\\".  In all honesty, I DIDN'T actually know, but I nodded told him I did anyway.<br />At best, all I can say about \\"Warning\\" is that it is awful, and abysmal.  The wonderful sales record for \\"Warning\\" only serves as proof that children will purchase anything that Green Day churns out, no matter how hackneyed, heartless, and unoriginal as it may be.  <br />One final thing of note: the organ tune played throughout \\"Misery\\" was stolen from the beautiful song entitled, \\"Sally's Song\\" from the film, \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\"; Green Day never gave credit to Danny Elfman.  I suggest you check it out (you can even buy it right here); it would definitely be a better investment than spending your hard-earned parents' money on \\"Warning\\".
B00005K9LN|5.0|There's my song. I love living after midNIGHT, and this is my anthem of the month. It's a little happy, but it's still quite an amazing mighty night song. The rest stand up with this classic, but they don't mention night. WE NEED MORE SONGS ABOUT NIGHT! Well, this rocks.
B000003TAB|5.0|Whichever user commented that \\"Incesticide\\", as opposed to \\"Bleach\\", is a better showcase of Nirvana's earlier days is wrong; although I don't care for \\"Bleach\\" as much as I do \\"Incesticide\\", \\"Incesticide\\" is lacking in its rawness that defined Nirvana's sound from the 1987-'90 era. That's not to say it's polished, but it definitely had more production value put into it.<br />One of the aspects I love best about \\"Incesticide\\" is its varied stylings. Most bands lose their identity when they try to vary their stylings, but Nirvana is one of the exceptions. They always seemed the type of band that could comfortably transition without losing their beautifully gritty sound. <br />My favorite tracks: \\"Mexican Seafood\\", \\"Hairspray Queen\\", \\"Beeswax\\", \\"Stain\\", and \\"Downer\\".
B00000JMOJ|5.0|Arnie has done some fantastic roles, and as an owner of the Arnie DVD four pack, I can say that I own some of his best work. Not only does he rip out some great one liners in this movie, but it's got some great action, and the social relevance to some of the &quot;extreme&quot; game shows out now is downright scary.<br />The basic premise of the film is just amazing.  Arnie does his usual role of one man army, taking out some cleverly thought of enemies. While a lot of the effects look cheesy by today's standards, I think this film is perfect. The supporting characters are kind of weak, except for a very cool Richard Dawson, but what do you expect.  Any movie with the balls to cast a Zappa is awesome in my opinion.<br />Ultimately, you need to own this DVD if you like Arnie. If you love Arnie, buy the DVD four pack instead.  While Commando isn't fantastic (save for those great one liners), the other three movies are Arnie classics.
B000003TAR|5.0|Although its production is less polished than \\"Nevermind\\", there was definitely more heart and dedication put into this release.  \\"In Utero\\" may be rough around the edges moreso than \\"Nevermind\\", but it has much more substance and emotion.  <br />I've noticed that many people hail the big hits of \\"In Utero\\" (\\"All Apologies\\", and \\"Scentless Apprentice\\") as some of Nirvana's best, but I disagree; I think that \\"Very Ape\\", \\"Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter\\", \\"Rape Me\\", and \\"Tourette's\\" are much more emotional and/or energetic. <br />My favorite tracks: \\"Very Ape\\", \\"Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter\\", \\"Rape Me\\" \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", and \\"Tourette's\\" <br />Least favorite track: \\"Scentless Apprentice\\"
6305508550|4.0|If there was an award for the movie that stood up to the most repeated viewings, it would be this one.  Mike Judge has made the kind of movie where the humor is sometimes dry, but is so incredibly smart that you tend to laugh again and again.<br />The characters in this movie are VERY memorable.  Samir is probably the funniest side character in the history of cinema.  I've never met an Indian (you know, from India) that was as tempermental as he is, but I hope I do someday.  Michael Bolton is awesome.  The guy is just totally down on life.  The whole cast really shines.  Diedrich Bader has a range to his talent that is just amazing (I didn't even recognize him the first two times I saw the film).<br />There really isn't a dull moment to the film.  It was cut so well that it just flows from beginning to end.  It's almost too short, but that's what makes it so easy to watch again.  This is truly a movie that gets funnier the more you watch it.  There are little nuances that you tend to notice after repeated viewings.<br />The only real drawback to the film, and the reason it loses a star, is the fact that the extras are really weak.  There's nothing here that really heightens your appreciation of the film.  I wanted to see deleted scenes (there had to be SOMETHING). I really want to give it five stars, but there are so many other great movies that package equally good extra features.<br />Don't let that deter you from buying the film. It was released to theaters with very little fanfare, so I doubt the studio will bother with a collector's edition.  Buy this one now.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Baz Lurhmann has created a stunning piece of eye-candy with the sumptious Moulin Rouge. Set in a turn-of-the century boheimian part of France, Moulin Rouge tells the story of Christian, the yong writer who falls in love with the sexy and sultry Moulin Rouge wanna-be actress Satine. The story follows their love story, complicated by the meanacing Duke, club owner Harold Zidler and the wonderfully comic Toulouse-Lautrec.<br />The entire production itself is quite stunning, with Oscar-calliber performances coming from Ewan McGregor (Christian), Nicole Kidman (Santine), Jim Broadbent (Zidler) and John Leguizamo (Toulouse). McGregor and Kidman have excellent voices, adding a certain type of...stlye to their roles, claiming them as their own. Elephant Love Meadly and Come What May showcase their vocal talents, as well as being beautiful songs in the movie. I thought Ewan rocked in Trainspotting, but he's even better than this, his performance as Christian is priceless. Words cannot due justice to the performance of Nicole Kidman as the fading Satine, played with just the right balance of vulnerability and sex appeal. Both McGregor and Kidman deserve Oscar nom's for their performances. Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo also bring brilliant comedic perfornaces to this wonderful ensemble piece, but the movie truly belongs to Ewan and Nicole.<br />The opulance of the Moulin Rouge and turn of the century Paris has been vibrantly brought to life by Lurhmann and his design team. The costumes of the can-can dancers at the Moulin Rouge are stunning, as well as the many dresses that Satine wears. Then there is the actual Moulin Rouge itself, both brilliant and decaying at the sametime, with it's iconic red windmill seemingly in the background of every shot. The choreography in the dancehall scenes is also fantastic, and the \\"play within a play\\" performance is equally as amaizing. It is obvious that Lurhmann spared no expense when it came to the production values...simply amaizing...<br />Overall, this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. It seems odd to have modern music in the picture, although it seemingly fits (especially the \\"joke\\" about the sound of music). Moulin Rouge is a great date movie, and even a good one for a rainy day. So even if you're not a big fan of movie musicals, rent Moulin Rouge at the very least and you will see, why \\"above all this is a story about love....\\"
6303823351|5.0|This is a great movie despite some mean people saying it wasn't! John is being his usual evil self, Paul is still the ladies man, George is still our favourite pessimest and Ringo is still adorable Ringo. <br />Ringo has unintentionally put on a sacrificial ring, and now he can't get it off. This ring belongs to a religion and, they want it back. Chaos insues.<br />There is an incredible amount of great humor in this movie. You need to see it, and if you don't want to risk buying it at least rent it!!
0440178002|5.0|The book is the story of an Englishman who crashes into Japan in his merchant ship in the year 1600.  From that point, he becomes a significant pawn in the fight for power in Japan.  I personally found it to be a captivating story from beginning to finish.  One does not need to know Japanese history to be interested in the story, although I personally relished it a bit more due to my previous knowledge of Japanese history.  There is plenty of action, political intrigue, and numerous subplots to keep your interest.  While it is a VERY long book, the pace is quite quick and it rarely bogs down.  I personally read it in less than a week and put other things aside just so I could read it.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Russel Crowe plays in A Beatiful Mind as a schizophrenic mathematical genius with a flair for seeing patterns and codes (sometimes where there are none).  In Gladiator, Crowe was painfully melodramatic for his role, but in this case, his acting was abosoloutly perfect.  The paranoia and delusional behavior of a schizophrenic is very well-portrayed desipite the difficult nature of it.  As for the movie itself, the movie-goer is smartly pulled into the delusions until they are revealed to be, in fact, delusions.  This gives the audience the sense of surprise that John Nash would feel as he learns that all he has been doing was a lie.  The occasional light comedy aspect of the film also brings a lightheartedness to an otherwise depressing subject.  Much like Fight Club, this is a movie you must see twice; Once when you know nothing of what is going on, and then again once you know what is truth and what is untruth.  In general, this film is a heartwarming story of one man overcoming innumerable odds and emerging victorious over himself.
1565115147|5.0|In this very interesting overview of world history, Jared Diamond traces the geographic, biological and intellectual factors that have shaped the world.  In attempting to answer the question of why some cultures are sucessful in leaving their mark on the world, while other, equally meritous cultures are engulfed or face extinction, he brings to bear a number of highly interesting, plausable hypotheses.  As a layperson, I found the analysis informative and easy to follow, and the ideas very new. The audiobook is just the thing to listen to in the car on a long and boring drive.  I recommend it highly to the general reader.
B00000DLV1|5.0|I love Portishead-plain and simple.They can do no wrong. I gave their2nd release as a gift to someonewho just wasn't ready to accept what P had to offer. I found it tobe the deepest, most stirring, evocative and transfixing music that year, possibly ever. I love DUMMY but the 2nd really took off and jetisoned itself far out into the cosmos. So, with PNYC I now have the quintessential cd from the band, so far. It is true that the recordingquality is extraordinary. It is also true that most of the performances are even better than instudio. I happen to adore the alternate version of sour times.Granted, I needed a few listensto get passed conditioning fromthe original..but once passed I nowfind the original a bit passe. There aren't enough superlativesto describe the visceral experienceI have when listening to Beth'svoice. The clever and oh so interesting way she slips in and out ofcharacter from one song to anotheras she changes tone and vocal stylings altogether. Hypnotic! Needless to say the symbiosis betweenher and the band make them indispensible to each other. They trulyare tight as a drum. Every note,every bar meticulous. There is incredible craftsmenship in their creativity that has no bounds and is of a magnitude words do little to define. When it couldn't getany more perfect, they add orchestra which was a stroke of brilliance. The drama and texturethis has given their songs is trulyinspired. I always return to thiscd and when I do it's like hearingit for the first time. Just having been notified of theirHIGHLY ANTICIPATEDand WAY OVERDUE new release ofpreviously unreleased material andmore...we can all gear up for whatwe can surely expect to be anothervisceral and other worldly, worldclass performance from P...a band unequalled!
B000056HOZ|2.0|The only reason I gave it two stars is because I need to feel I didn't totally waste $24.00. I am a huge Bruce fan but this is the worst of Bruce. The acting videos are campy, the live videos are good. The acoustic Born in the USA is about the worst!!!! It is so pretentious, this is BAD blues at best. Also there is no DVD extras at all, no commentary, no interviews...nothing. This DVD is awful.
6305841861|4.0|Rating: +4<br /><br />In the eighties, Evil Dead was a moderate success for director Sam Raimi & somehow managed to gross $2,400,000 upon it's initial release in the U.S  even though the budget was only $375,000. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film has since managed to acquire a dedicated following as well as two successful sequels. (Horror writer Stephen King gave the film massive props in a November 1982 issue of Twilight Zone.) Not only did the sequels do exceptionally well, the films have all received multiple re-issues on DVD & several re-pressings through various distributors. Probability suggests that Evil Dead's popularity will remain a constant & this film's devoted followers will always cite this first entry as being their absolute favorite.<br /><br />Within the past few years, Evil Dead has also been made into an off-Broadway musical production with the approval of Bruce Campbell & Sam Raimi.<br /><br />Although Evil Dead 2 works well as a sequel, I've always considered the film to be a re-visioning of the first low-budget classic only this time Raimi had more moo-lah-ah to play with. Even though there are sure-fire elements of horror present, I'm not REALLY sure I'd call it a straight-forward horror flick as it's way too goofy to be taken seriously. Having said that, there's plenty to love here & more reason to re-visit Evil Dead a second time. Need I say that the laughs come as fast as the gore??<br /><br />How gory is Evil Dead 2? The film is unrated which means it wasn't submitted to the MPAA<br />because it surely would have gotten something more than an R), and in fact inspired the distributor (De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, founded by Dino De Laurentiis) to create Rosebud Releasing for this one film. There are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and plenty of gore to satisfy the blood-thirsty nuts like myself who simply can't get enough of it. Oh, yes there will be blood. Buckets.<br /><br />For some odd reason, Ash (played by Bruce Campbell) seems to love taking weekend trips with his girlfriend to this evil little place in the woods. You would think he might've learned his lesson after dealing with those demons from hell in the first entry & decided to take up golf as a hobby or maybe find another vacation spot. Instead, he would rather do battle with these evil minions in a haunted cabin once again. Some guys never learn I guess.<br /><br />Evil Dead 2 picks up immediately where it's predecessor ended. Ashley takes his girlfriend on a seemingly romantic vacation back to the cabin in the woods. All is well until Ash begins to play a recording of Professor Knowby's incantations from the Necronomicon (roughly translated \\"Book Of The Dead\\") & the trouble immediately starts up again. As once can probably guess, the recorded passages unleash an evil force which takes possession of Linda's body & Ash is forced to either kill her or be killed.<br /><br />I could go into further details here for you but why kill the ultimate experience? As anyone who has seen this entry or any other Evil Dead film an tell you, the proof is definitely in the pudding. What becomes of a terrified Ash & is it really possible to kill Linda? If Ash can bring himself to murder the girlfriend, will she stay dead? Will Ash ever escape this nightmare in the woods or will he find himself the catalyst in a series of grotesque encounters with the demonic world?<br /><br />Evil Dead is often touted as being a zombie flick by it's fans or cult following. While there are elements of the film which do remind us of zombie flicks, I've always seen the film to be about demonic possession. I will even go so far as to say I've seen countless threads or postings online where people have debated this for many years. At any rate, it's an entertaining flick & that's all that should matter.

6305558167|5.0|Excalibur weaves a dark and mystical vision of magic through a grimly realistic story of medieval war.  The result is totally engrossing.  Watching this movie, you will lose yourself in the story of Arthur as never before.  The video quality on the DVD is exceptional, and does justice to the lush cinematography.
0425152251|5.0|This book was really great. It made you think of things that you would normally never think of. Although some of the histories of philosophy could get a little boring, other more interesting parts make up for them.
6305079811|5.0|Yes, this move does a good job capturing the the feel of the old movie serials.  But more importantly, it shows why those serials were so popular: it's a really fun movie!<br />Call it camp, call it retro, call it a trash classic - but you'll find yourself cheering for Flash and his friends as they fight the evil forces of Ming the Merciless.  <br />The sound track by Queen is outstanding in its own right, and adds a lot to the adrenaline level.
B0000214F0|3.0|Well, this is a hard one to review. On an exploitation-flick scale, it's five stars, no doubt; this is about as trashy a major-distribution film as I can think of.<br />As far as actual quality, well...O'Toole is a lot of fun to watch (although personally I get more B-film thrills watching him in THE STUNT MAN), McDowall is also pretty good as Caligula, and there's some OK hardcore footage (well-shot at the very least).<br />It's worth checking out as long as you don't get yourself all hyped up for \\"The most controversial film of all time\\"...just watch it with the same mindframe you'd use to watch, say, ILSA: SHE-DEVIL OF THE S.S., or a low-budget slasher flick, and you'll have a heck (can I say that here?) of a time.
B00005RFAI|3.0|oh god, she is so fine. Pink wants my body.
B00005NWM3|4.0|1ST new solid rock album I have heard in a decade. Some of the lyrics are not to my taste, but other than that I love it!!  How You Remind Me is an astounding song. The vocals, music, and lyrics are all outstanding, and even though it does get a lot of air play I'm not tired of it yet.  Too Bad, Hollywood, Where do I Hide are good songs also. I especially liked Good Times Gone. This CD takes me back to my rock and roll years and I loved every minute of it.  I haven't been to a concert in years but I would love to see these guys!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I'm glad I only rented this thing and didn't put out any more money than a couple of bucks.  That's all it's worth.<BR>All you folks who know anything at all about the early 1940's and the real Pearl Harbor, rent it, watch it for the action sequences, return it, and forget it.  This has nothing to do with what actually happened, and it carries no \\"feel\\" whatsoever of the early `40's.  Most, not all, but most of the people who are giving the best reviews are those who do not know their history and are willing to accept anything which looks good, and what the \\"critics\\" tell them is good. <BR>Trust me... the animation is the only redeming factor in this movie.  <BR>History goes out the window on a greased skid, so if you're expecting to learn anything about the attack, or WWII in general... again, forget it.  The two fighter pilots never saw the Doolittle raid, but survived the war as successful pilots.  Ken Taylor became a Brigader General and at last report is living in Ancorage, Alaska.  George Welch (of the grape juice family) became a test pilot for North American Avaition after the war, and was killed in an air crash.  The movie gives the impression that these were the only two to become airborne, when in fact there were nearly twenty others.<BR>Another irritation is the Japanese sub-titles are tiny, and some, not being in dark boxes, are invisible against the background.<BR>In a nutshell, the action sequences were so-so, and the rest was BORING!  If you want to see a much better movie about Pearl Harbor, stick with Tora, Tora, Tora.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|I just saw this movie and I have not had a chance to think about it very much yet, but the idea that everything is in the perception is always an intriguing one.  First, running the story backwards is inticing--a brilliant way to isolate pure perception from interpretation.  Anything that shows how the passage of time affects our memory and opinions is a winner.  What was disappointing was that superimposed over this simple and gigantic concept, was a lot of silliness about murder and personal deception.  The twisting of memory and the concept of time was deception enough.  Overdone.  Maybe shooting for both depth and marketability is not such a great formula.  Notice I still gave it four stars--greatness underlies this plot-encumbered story.
6305531412|5.0|I can garauntee you will be extremely disappointed with this movie on DVD. This the most atrocious DVD I have ever bought. There are no special features in it at all. The picture quality is very poor. Why did they alter the film without the director's approval? Can someone please explain that to me? On the DVD the movie is censored. The film is excellent. Bob Hoskins did a wonderful job in this. Roger Rabbit is hilarious and Jessica Rabbit, too. It was incredible to see all those cartoon characters from Disney, Warner Brothers, and others interact with each other and live action people. I fully recommend this movie but DO NOT buy the DVD. Buy the VHS Instead. I Bought it on DVD and I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
B000003S0B|4.0|After IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING, Crimsom's masterpiece debut album, and after Ian Mcdonald departure, Fripp had to think about some changes in the band. Lake was about to left the band (to join ELP) and Peter Giles (an old friend) was called. Mel Collins (great musician from Circus) replaced Mcdonald. Keith Tipet appears on some tracks playing piano.<BR> The album is a great early progressive recording. Many people say it's a copy of the first one. They're not totally right. IN THE WAKE OF POSEIDON is a transitional album, where Crimson is trying to develop its peculiar sonority. Unfortunately, Greg Lake just recorded the vocals and his participation on the album was minimal. Peter Giles is a nice bass player, but he's not Greg Lake... All the strong characteristics of the firts album is present: powerfull mellotron, great acoustic guitar work and dark lyrics and textures. It's true that the best tracks use the same structure of the best tracks of the first album. \\"Picture of a City\\" is a heavy jazzy-rock track, maybe the best one. Excelet drums, sax and guitar work. Point for Lake's acid vocals (like 21st Century Schizoid man). \\"Cat Food\\" is a \\"funky\\" track, VERY interesting, nice piano work and lyric. A little bit confuse but very different from Crimson's tracks of this period. \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" is a dramatic and powerfull song (like Epitaph), another CLASSIC. Great mellotron. \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" is sung by Gordon Hasckel. A BEAUTIFUL song, marvelous Fripp's acoustic guitar. His voice is not that wonder, but what a melody... \\"Devils Triangle\\" is an experimental/Epic track, extremly strong at its end, but too long.... The highlights of the album are Fripp's harmonies, Michel Gilles drums and Lake vocals. The album is a Classic, there's no doubt, but the major atributtes of King Crimson are not totally present: angry guitars, improvised drums and introspective arrangements. The best things from Fripp and this amazing band came few years later.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|The epitome of tormented female-oriented music, this New York native writes arty alterna-rock with an urban twinge of melancholy; like a lonely person walking along the empty streets of a big city.  (One immediate smiles at the correlation between the chug-a-chug chorus of her single, Fast As You Can and the subway-shot video for it).  Whereas her first album, Tidal, was primarily comprised of variations on a tortured crush theme, albeit with surprising awareness and articulation, When the Pawn... (90 word title) explores more intimate aspects of this young woman's mental state in addition to all the boy-craziness- \\"Paper Bag\\" - \\"hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills...\\"  For instance, \\"Mistake\\" explores Apple's ambivalence towards authority (\\"Do I wanna do right?/ Of course!/But do I really want to feel I'm forced?/To answer you/Hell no!\\"), and \\"The Way Things Are\\" focuses on the natural human longing to stay in one miserable state instead of taking the effort to break free and become mentally healthy (\\"Wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice/If it rolled right past me...I'm much better off/The way things are\\").  When the Pawn... is essential for anyone who likes good alternative music with thought-provoking lyrics. Footnote: Although people will always think \\"chick rock\\" when they think of Fiona (perhaps it's because of involvement in Lilith Fair?) When the Pawn... is not purely \\"feminine\\" music at all.  Yes she's a woman and yes, she's writing about herself, but the struggles and joys that her lyrics convey are not at all gender specific. And besides, those electric guitar riffs, those ever-moving bass lines, and those drum solos, are damn edgy and contain a lot of testosterone, which beautifully blends with Fiona's feminine, sultry alto.
B00005TT77|4.0|This is such an amazing disc.<br />It impresses me how this album is able to take modern artists -- the kind that actually have careers -- and organize them over a three-week period to make this disc. There's so many great Beatles covers on here.<br />My favorite of the moment is Ben Folds' \\"Golden Slumbers\\". Ben always has this ability to give a song emotional lift -- from \\"Alice Childress\\" off of his first disc with the Five to \\"The Luckiest\\" and \\"Still Fighting It\\" off of his solo disc. No exception here. It's awesome.<br />Other favorites off the album include Howie Day's rendition of \\"Help!\\" (someone give this kid a record deal already), Rufus Wainright's \\"Across the Universe\\" (amazing, since I hate his original material to death), and Eddie Vedder's \\"You've got to Hide Your Love Away\\". Those tracks are the true standouts on this disc.<br />I would give it five stars, but there are a couple of songs that falter and add little to the original versions -- Ben Harper's \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" would pass off as the Beatles version if Harper's voice wasn't so soulful, and the Black Crowes' version of \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" suffers from the same fate. In a case of a song that's not good for a totally different reason, Grandaddy's \\"Revolution\\" is just a little too off-center to be enjoyable (though I recommend \\"The Sophtware Slump\\" by them).<br />Overall, it's not absolutely perfect, but it's close. Buy and enjoy.
0812550706|5.0|I doesnt whether you like Science fiction or fantasy you will like this book. It is very easy to understand it. The characters minds are very complex and will go deep into their minds. My description of the book would be : In the future there was a war in space against an alien race. and it is over but for the world to be prepared it is taking in young children who have good minds who could someday be the commanders if there is a war again, they are put up in space and the children are split up into different groups called armys. They play a game where thier commander leads them into battle against another army. Then one day a new boy is brought up ther and his name is Andrew Wiggin or know as Ender and he is very good at the game and others are mad and thats were trouble arises. I would reccomend this book to ages 13 and up.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I bought this collection of episodes just recently. I really enjoyed the comedy in the show. There are some quite amazing things that take place at Fawlty Towers, but it's all good fun. John Cleese is a natural and this  show highlights this wonderful man, because he portrays his character very well!<BR>This is good stuff! I highly recommend it- even if you're not familiar with it, because neither was I!

The audio commentary is GREAT! lots of laughs =)<BR>One bad thing is that not all the tracks on the 3-CD album Live Scenes from NY are on the DVD. But you can't ask for more since the DVD is titled Metropolis 2000.<BR>To all of you who want's to experience something you'll never forget, buy the DVD! or even better go to their concerts!
B00004TJFL|5.0|halloween and halloween 2 were suspenseful, don't ask about part 3. then came part 4, very good but nottoo suspenseful sequel. but part 5 is, you should watch it in the dark with popcorn and some friends...it's that good!
B000000OQF|5.0|I remember the first day I heard of Guns N' Roses.  I was watching MTV and they played Sweet Child O' Mine.  I was instantly blown away of how amazing this song was, and how amazing the band were.  The next day, I went out and bought the album, and it didn't leave my CD player for a year. I'm not exagerating.  Some bands come and go, but even today, in 2002, Guns N' Roses songs are played just as much on the radio as they were 15 years ago.  I'm not going to talk about the songs, because most everyone has heard a Guns N' Roses song.  And most everybody likes it.  You can take 15 year old boys who are into Marilyn Manson and they will like it.  ....<br />What it comes down to it, this album is amazing.  Every song is amazing, every note fits.  Axl's voice is truly unique, duff's bass is great, Izzy's guitar swirls around underneath Slash's amazing solos, and Steven's drumming is perfect for the songs.  <br />And that's it.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I am 28 years old and I am not sorry to say that I loved (yes loved) this movie. I don't really know how it compared to the historical event because our wonderful schools in this country did not teach my age group about it. Which is very sad. But I digress. I thought the acting was great and the special effects were top notch. (Typical of Michael Bay movies)  But I am a female so that might have something to do with the fact that I liked this movie so much. But I generally DO NOT watch love stories or as some call them &quot;chick flix&quot;.  I do own the DVD and I would not trade any other movie for it. But this is just my opinion.  Thank you for your time.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Shakira has arrived with her English album &quot;Laundry Service&quot;, and with a bang debuting at No.3 on the Billboards Hot 200 Album Chart.  A feat for a new artist which has only been matched by Alicia Keys this year going to No.1.<br />However, though Shakira writes all her songs there are some hits and misses on this album.  Pop wise it is very interesting and goes different directions.<br />Her first single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; is a hit...and I really don't know why.  The song basically sounds like she is ready to yodel her way down the hill after milking a cow...she should call herself &quot;Heidi&quot;.<br />The whole song is really a mish mash of instruments and sounds that trys to be different but just becomes the same old pop sound.  Though her lyrics are clever referring to her certain body parts as small mountains and going through the song with catchy rhymes, this album trys to go a pop path of trying to be different and avant garde but misses the boat in 50% of the album.<br />All the songs are good, they are just disposable pop that in my opinion won't be playing on peoples CD machines a year from now.<br />Though Shakira has a wonderful voice and she basically runs the helm on all her music, I just don't think she is pushing any music industry envelopes with this album.<br />Laundry Service needs to put some bleach into the rinse cycle to clean some stains out, and maybe Shakira will become a household name.<br />The standout cuts include &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;, &quot;Rules&quot; and &quot;Fool&quot;, and that is it.  I honestly think the first single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; which is currently in the Top 10 is the weakest cut from the album, and the only reason it is a hit is because the teenage boys like the way Shakira shakes her hips, and the girls like her long flowing hear and hip fashions.<br />Otherwise Shakira is the Nena (99 Luftballoons) of the new millenium.  I predict she will be a one-hit wonder...unless she starts writing some better material.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This adaptation was entertaining to watch and faithful to the book. The casting (which can make or break some films) was excellent. Gwenyth Paltrow adopts an English accent for the first time in this film and, as she has since done with SLIDING DOORS and SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, she carries it off beautifully. Enjoy!
B00005QG9J|4.0|I'm sick of everybody accusing Incubus of selling out just because this album is, overall, less heavy than \\"Make Yourself. \\"Notice that the singles released so far have been some of the heavier tracks. This is not following the formula of \\"Drive\\" and \\"Stellar.\\" That aside... here is a track-by-track rundown.<br />1. Nice to Know You- The second single opens the album with a bang, one of the harder tracks and very solid. If you listen to the chorus, the song is a paradox- one of Brandon Boyd's songwriting trademarks that make his unusually deep lyrics even more enjoyable. (8/10)<BR>2. Circles- Another heavy track. Not much to say about this one, other than that it's a fun listen. (7/10)<BR>3. I Wish You Were Here- The first single is the obligatory radio-friendly track, with a hooky chorus and not much else. Still, it's not bad. (6/10)<BR>4. Just a Phase- One of the best songs I have ever heard. Period. This five and a half minute masterpiece features the band's DJ making sound effects at the beginning, and slowly builds into a song, which is very soft and meaningful. It takes two minutes to get into the lyrics, and just when it seems that the band is building up to a climax, they fake you out and cut. Later in the song, the same climax reaches a brief point of loudness- an excellent contrast that is much preferrable to some of the bile on the radio today. (10/10)<BR>5. 11 A.M.- The trend of softness continues. It's not really one of my favorite tracks though. (5/10)<br />6. Blood on the Ground- Here, Brandon Boyd's songwriting skills really shine. \\"I don't want to talk to you anymore, I'm afraid of what I might say. I bite my tongue when I see you, because blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground.\\" You can't top that. It's fairly radio friendly, and rocks hard. (9/10)<BR>7. Mexico- Hauntingly pretty and the softest songs on the album. It is a desperate song that can shed a tear or two (You only think about yourself...) (8/10)<BR>8. Warning!- This is a somewhat avant garde song. Listen to it on a spring day. It's even better after reading about the meaning on the band's website. I can imagine hearing it on the radio. (8.5/10)<BR>9. Echo- This must be the equivalent of \\"Stellar\\". And it fails. It doesn't seem to have much meaning. But it's strangely likeable. (7/10)<BR>10. Have You Ever- Hardness. (4/10)<BR>11. Are You In?- This is an example of the strange cliche of one-line songs. \\"It's so much better when everyone is in, are you in? Oooooooooh...\\" (repeated many times) \\"It's so much better when sea foam is green...\\" Strangely bizarre, this song is undeniably catchy, but not meant to be one of the stronger tracks. (7/10)<BR>12. Under My Umbrella- Contrasts again between soft and loud, but the changes are much more stark and sudden than other songs. Another deep song which, nevertheless, can be easily comprehended. (8/10)<BR>13. Aqueous Transmission- Incubus turns Japanese (no reference to their remake of \\"Turning Japanese) on this very ethnic-sounding, ambitious peace. The lyrics are nothing special, but they don't have to be. It's such a novelty, but, nothing is a novelty with this band. (8/10)<br />In a nutshell, ambitious and without profanity (unlike \\"Make Yourself\\".)
B00003JRCQ|4.0|One could make an argument that PERSUASION is Jane Austen's best book, and her fans (including me!) usually have their own ideas of how best to adapt her work. This adaptation is not as well done as Thompson's SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY, or the perfect A&amp;E version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. However, it is well done, and respectful of the original work. A lot of the book takes place in Anne Elliot's head, so the screenwriters had to supply a good deal of the dialogue--there was no way around that. My biggest complaint is that the casting seemed off in the case of Anne and Frederick. They are both well-known, talented actors, but considering that Anne is supposed to be 27 and Frederick 35 they seemed...too mature. But over-all, I recommend it as a good film!
B000000WG3|5.0|I've owned copies of this album in three format: LP, cassette tape and CD. This is one of the few 80's recordings that sounds as fresh today as it did back in the days. &quot;The Loner&quot; still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. &quot;Over The Hills...&quot; and &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; are notable in that they don't feature blistering guitar solos, yet they still rank among the best Moore compositions ever. In fact, this &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; is significant because it is NOT a &quot;guitar&quot; album - no flash, no gratuituous solos - but rather a collection of great songs written and performed by perhaps the most underrated rock guitarist in modern times. To me, Moore's recent blues tangent has grown old fast, but his 80's recordings are timeless. Also recommended: &quot;Corridors of Power&quot; and  &quot;G-Force.&quot;
B00005221M|2.0|Ever wonder what might happen if the former executive producer of Miami Vice directed Dances With Wolves?<br />One's worst fears are confirmed in \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", an overly long frontier rock video that masquerades as an epic tale of love and war. And, yes, it happens to be directed by Michael Mann, former executive producer of Miami Vice and director of such stylish fare as \\"Heat\\" and \\"Manhunter\\".<br />The film marks the third Hollywood attempt at the James Fenimore Cooper novel. The setting is 18th century New York, where war rages between England and France, each vying for control of the Americas.<br />Daniel Day-Lewis plays Hawkeye (no Alan Alda jokes, please), the white, adopted son of a Mohican tribesman, who falls for an English officer's daughter, played by Madeleine Stowe. Their relationship is threatened by the war and the evil Magua (Wes Studi), the leader of the Huron bent on destroying Stowe's family.<br />It's a great story with plenty of room for commentary on war and interracial romance. However, the film quickly falls apart, primarily owing to Mann's overblown direction.<br />Mann presents Hawkeye as an untouchable God-like figure, and right from the beginning it's clear that he will conquer any tribe that gets in his way (and, of course, any woman who strikes his fancy).<br />In one scene, Day-Lewis runs into battle and doesn't so much as get a scratch as those around him get shot, scalped, and have their tongues forcibly removed from their heads. He emerges from the battle to give his girlfriend a hug. Awwww, ain't love grand?<br />It's discouraging to see Day-Lewis here, fresh from his Oscar win for My Left Foot, reduced to running through the forest in slow motion. His lines are few and far between, and what little dialogue he has is delivered in one of those phony \\"Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon\\" American accents.<br />Head-crushing is the order of the day, as Day-Lewis morphs into Rambo, beating bad guys to a pulp and delivering an eerily Stallone-like speech under a waterfall. \\"They drew first blood, Adrian!\\"<br />Stowe is also wasted. She's the love interest here and, as such, stands around and screams until Day-Lewis can hack his way to her. <br />Within the disappointing film is a good performance by Studi as the bad guy from the wrong side of the tribe. He's appropriately evil and adds some much-needed tension.<br />The battle scenes are relatively well done, but have a Hollywood feel to them that undermines their effectiveness.<br />Here's to hoping that this will be the last of the \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" we see for some time.
0679428887|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but this book inspired one. Mr. Harris is a wordsmith who crafts sentences as individual pieces of art. I listened to this as an audiobook and found myself constantly replaying sentences. More amazingly, I listend to the whole thing all over again as soon as I finished it the first time. The fact that he uses these wonderful sentences to tell a thrilling and different story puts this one right over the top. I normally give my audiobooks to our library as soon as I finish listening to them on my long commute, but while I hope they get a copy for all to enjoy, this one I'm keeping. I may want to pop a cassette in yet again to savor this unexpected treasure.
6305212112|4.0|In an era where most women's film roles are confined to stereotypical sex objects and second bananas, Fried Green Tomatoes is a breath of fresh air.<br />The film, directed by Jon Avnet, boasts not one, but four strong women's roles. They are executed to near perfection by actresses Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker and Jessica Tandy.<br />Adapted from from Fannie Flagg's novel, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, the film tells two fascinating, intertwining stories.<br />The first centers on the Bates character, a middle-aged woman attempting to make sense of life and menopause. She meets a nursing home resident played by Tandy, whom she visits for solace. Tandy shares her recollections of life in her hometown of Whistle Stop, which become the film's second story.<br />Tandy and Bates are excellent, as one might expect from two Oscar winners. The star turns, however, come courtesy of Parker and Masterson; their performances make the flashback sequences the most beautiful and telling parts of the film.<br />Though some might dismiss Fried Green Tomatoes as strictly the stuff of sentimentalists, it offers more than just good feelings. In one scene, there is a surprising act of violence that culminates in a scene of disgustingly fitting logic, and racial attitudes are also explored.<br />No matter how you slice it, Fried Green Tomatoes is a feast of delectable entertainment.
B00004TJFL|1.0|Halloween 4 was really good, but this movie (is bad)! In Halloween 4 Dr. Loomis says that Michael kills his family members and anyone who gets in his way. In this movie, he kills people he doesn't need to kill and stalks teens at a party when he should be going after his niece. An example is Sammy and Spitz. They didn't need to die, but they did. Another thing about this movie that I hated was that it was really bloody and gory, and was a kill fest. Halloween 1 - 4 wern't gory, but this movie crossed the line. This movie also brought in the whole subplot of the Man In Black which made Halloween 6 to be bad. I would only reccommend this movie to people who love slash fast movies. Halloween fans will be dissappointed. The mask in the movie was really bad and there was really nothing I liked that much about it. Halloween 1, 2, and 4 had a great atmosphere on suspence and terror, this movie has an atmosphere on bloody, gory, multi-killing deaths. All I can say is that this movie could have been much better. It can't get any eaiser than that. Something better to buy is the Halloween 5 soundtrack which has really great music. I am very dissapointed and somewhat hurt about what this movie did to the series.
0800177177|2.0|If you look no further than cinematography, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a great film. Unfortunately, there's a whole lot more than cinematography here.<br />The film takes place in 19th Century London. Dracula (Gary Oldman) accidentally discovers that his 15th-Century wife, Mina (Winona Ryder) has been reincarnated. What's worse, she's engaged to a starch-collared English sap (Keanu Reeves).<br />At this point, Dracula does what any jealous lover might do: he traps Mina's fiancee in his castle, turns into a monkey-wolf, possesses Mina's best friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost), and has his way with her (yes, as the monkey-wolf).<br />As Lucy slowly transforms into one of Dracula's love vampirettes, Mina inexplicably falls in love with the prince of the undead himself. Enter Dr. Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), vampire hunter.<br />As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters are under the control of a horrible unseen force that influences the very logic of their actions. That unseen force, however, is not some form of Draculian mind control. It's screenwriter James V. Hart's incredibly muddled screenplay.<br />Hart, the same guy responsible for the abysmal &quot;Hook&quot; screenplay, has packed the film with meaningless and baffling action. From the word go, it becomes apparent that obvious that not one of the characters will behave in a way that even remotely resembles human reaction.<br />In the acting department, no one is hurt more by the shoddy writing than Ryder. Why, for instance, does she seem to be emotionally unaffected when her friend becomes a vampire? <br />Oldman is an adequate Dracula. His young, romantic Dracula doesn't always ring true, but his old n' crusty Dracula is fittingly foul and intriguing.<br />Hopkins is ever the scene stealer as the film's only intentional source of comic relief. Radiating charisma, he makes his fellow actors look like cardboard cutouts. Then again, one of them is Keanu Reeves...<br />Reeves is exceptionally terrible in the role of Mina's fiancee. His accent is bad, his acting is bad, darn it, even his haircut is bad. <br />Despite these problems, you still have to hand it to Fracis Ford Coppola and his remarkable cinematographer, Michael Balhaus. Though a mainstream film, Dracula is daringly packed with double exposures, alternating film speeds and distinctive shading.<br />A visual feast, everything else about Dracula -- ahem -- bites.
B000059MEK|5.0|The best nights of my life have involved boogying to this album in a state of sheer intoxication. Purist raw beats have no place on this album - this one is for fun. I brought this album for a weekend away and we ended up fighting over space on the table to dance to these funky disco beats. Two favourite tracks are by far &quot;Harder Better Faster Stronger&quot; wand &quot;aerodynamic&quot; which are the ultimate party starter tracks.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Widely regarded as a modern-day classic, Beauty and the Beast boasts action, danger, romance comedy, and fantastic musical numbers. It's also the only \\"cartoon\\" to be nominated for the best-picture Oscar.<br />The film takes place in an animated France (and when aren't the <BR>French animated?) and opens with the introduction of \\"Belle\\", the beauty who loves reading so much that she fails to notice most everything around her, including the advances of boorish stud, Gaston.<br />One day, Belle's father, a crackpot inventor, ventures out into a strange forest and encounters a cursed castle. When he is taken prisoner by the castle's beastly inhabitant, Belle must come to his rescue.<br />First and foremost, Beauty and the Beast proves that not all cartoons are for kids. In many ways, the characters in Beauty and the Beast are more real than other films with flesh and blood actors. In fact, most actors would kill for roles like these. <br />My personal favorite of the film's many great characters is Gaston, the best Disney villain of all time, a conceited buffoon and deadly enemy. Gaston's theme song is one of the funniest scenes from any film -- probably ever. \\"No one's slick as Gaston/No one's quick as Gaston/No one's neck is incredibly thick as Gaston,\\" sing the boozers at the local watering hole to Gaston, who proudly displays his antler collection and chest hair.<br />Where other films pander to select audiences, Beauty and the Beast truly has something for everyone.
B000002N3N|5.0|Over the past few years this album has been used to cheer me up and calm me down. It is one of the fwe albums that I have had for about five years and am not ashamed of nowadays. A very escapist chilled album to listen to whenever you don't want to be disturbed. This abum will carry you through every mood and atmosphere and leave you feeling refreshed.
B00005JA2B|5.0|This is quite simply one of rock's greatest albums. <br />If ever a band hit a creative peak and laid down an album of classic tracks in one go then this is it. There isn't a dud or average track present and every one scores a hit.<br />From the well known radio classic Carry On Wayward Son, Kansas most famous song, to passionate masterpieces like The Wall, the frenetic Magnum Opus and wonderful Cheyenne Anthem this album is filled from start to finish with superlative musicianship, songs, lyrics, and vocals.<br />This is a must buy for any rock fan, not just fans of Kansas.
B00003CXXP|1.0|When I saw \\"AI\\" in the movie theater I loved the first act -- I was completely \\"there\\" -- but by the time the 3rd ending rolled around, I was staring at my watch, more that bored -- I was mad!  I felt manipulated, and I couldn hardly wait to get out of the theater.   Masterpiece?  I don't get it.  The most interesting character is \\"Snuggle the Fabric Softener Bear.\\" And one more thing -- I think most people would agree that if a child is lost and friendless, what should he do?  Why, hang out with a male hustler, of course.  Kubrick was a genius.  Spielberg is brilliant.  (And the story is fascinating.)  But together, they've created a peanut butter & pastrami on raisin bread sandwich - somethimes things that are great separately don't fit together.
B000002NC4|5.0|This album, while nothing like other BTS stuff, is absolutely amazing.  There is just so much to every song.  Each is an experiance in itself.  If you like Built to Spill or appreciate good music in any way, buy this album immediately (It will probably change your life).  After that, if you just don't &quot;get&quot; how incredible this album is, I don't know what to tell you.
078322818X|5.0|Having gone to high school at the same time as the teenagers in this movie classic, I can tell you with some authority that it rings true.  All of the classic characters are there--the popular class president, played by Ron Howard; the cheerleading captain, Cindy Williams; the nerd; the tough guy with the heart of gold who drives around in his souped-up car looking for a race; the young wannabe who acts tough just to fit in, MacKenzie Phillips; the young man who can't make up his mind as to what he want out of life, Richard Dreyfuss; and the challenger for other guy's girls and their bragging rights while drag racing, Harrison Ford.  Half of the fun is the classic rock 'n roll music played in the background, along with the clothes and hairdos which are defintive early 60's.  Come cruisin' with the great cast of \\"American Graffiti\\" and see what life was really like back then.
B000002I25|5.0|This first album by the Doors glided on the music scene back in 1967 like a manhole cover: unlike the standard jejeune and pollyanna pap of that era, The Doors presented a darker poetic psychedelic vision with complex themes and interesting music arrangements. The overall effect was haunting: none of the cuts on this CD are losers. I think most people will enjoy it, and this is a worthy addition to a rock music collection.<br />There's the full-length version of \\"Light My Fire.\\" Jim Morrison did the definitive version here: all imitations pale by contrast, including the annoying José Feliciano cover. He does a fine version of Kurt Weill's \\"Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)\\" -- which originally came in Bertholt Brecht's \\"Aufsteig Und Fall Der Stadt Mahagonny.\\" Enjoy the rich irony of \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" the moodiness of \\"The Crystal Ship\\" and the ambiguities of \\"Back Door Man.\\"<br />There are others: \\"Break On Through,\\" Soul Kitchen,\\" \\"Take It As It Comes.\\" These are each satisfying efforts. In fact, you can only understand the enormous success of the Doors as being the product of each of the band members: Jim Morrison, Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and Robby Krieger. <br />\\"The End\\" provides a final coda to this CD with an excursion into the dark night of the soul worthy of San Juan de la Cruz. It's long; but gripping and well-worth listening to. It may well be their masterpiece.<br />\\"The Doors\\" is now about 35 years old. However, I think it has stood the test of time well and has a contemporary flavor. This is not the golden oldie museum-piece music that is likely to be served up in fern bars: this is a contemporary musical journey into the Heart of Darkness.
B000003CMB|5.0|my review:<BR>I love this, it was awsome.  it contained one of the greatest guitar players i've ever heard in my life.  the songs capture the Allman brother's mastery of the blues, rock, and jamming instramentuls.  there is more in 10 minutes of this cd then any god damn phish cd i've ever heard.  thats all, this band aint no jam band though.  it defies genre  for that i leave you.  goodnight<BR>Jesse
B00000I8UD|5.0|I always knew of Sylvian, and knew of his former group Japan, but always steered clear of him, labelling him as just another averagely-talented mood music artist who likes to do his own thing with a droany voice! But a friend of mine handed me a tape of this album saying they thought it was one of the best albums of the year, and after 3 plays i was hooked! I rarely find an album that takes advantage of the 74 minute CD length and holds my interest all the way through, but this one did. Right from the first cut, I Surrender, a real laid-back mood jounrey that just pours from the speakers, nine and a half minutes, but it just flies by. There isn't the recogniseable standard pop song structure to his songs some last only briefly but all linger in the memory, i have since visit all his back catalogue and really love some of them, but nothing is as complete, as sure-footed and as accomplished as this, you can really see how much he's learnt, if you don't like Sylvian the first thing you'll nail is his voice. But once you're into him they'll be no turning back and you'll realise his voice lends itself so well to the songs and is better than you first think! The sheer fluidity of all the songs makes it sound like no other. I don't usually rate albums this much but i'm converted, give it a go, stick with it and see what you think.
B0000025DR|5.0|I really like this album.  It is a true legend.  I remember some of the songs when they were brand new, especially \\"Fire on High.\\"  I like the beginning.  It sounds kind of scary, and then it suddenly changes, and becomes more rockin'.  My favorite song on the album is \\"Evil Woman.\\"  I also like \\"Strange Magic,\\" and \\"Nightrider.\\"  Alot of the songs remind me of Beatles, and George Harrison.  So if you like ELO, I highly recommend this CD.
B00004D3C1|1.0|Depending on who you talk to, the originators of \\"stoner rock\\" were alternatively Kyuss or Black Sabbath.  The main problem with the genre nowadays is that there seem to be very few bands that are creating music that goes beyond that which has already been mastered.  Fu Manchu is one of the reasons that the genre has continued to stagnate.  If you want Kyuss clones, there are a few very good ones, namely Dozer and Lowrider.  While Fu isn't exactly a stoner clone of Kyuss, it is clear that originalty and musical growth passed by this band about halfway through their first CD.  Each song on every CD sounds the same and not only on each CD but ACROSS each CD.  Included in this unoriginality is the fact that the vocals are unparalleded in their lameness.  The same five or seven syllable cadance is chanted throughout each song and again could be swapped over to any song on any of their releases.  What's sad is that there is a lot of potential and talent in this band.  If you need new stoner rock, don't buy Fu unless you know you like it.  Come to think of it, don't buy Nebula either as they sound EXACTLY the same as Fu Manchu.
6302763835|3.0|First saw this flick back in the 70s when it was featured on a late night show called ¡°Horror Incorporated¡±.  I loved it then but more than two decades later, the film seems rather pathetic although still fun to watch.<br />If you¡¯re into cheesy yet fun 50s sci-fi thrillers, this is one movie to add to your collection.  Capitalizing on the popularity of ¡°Them¡± released a year earlier, it is a tarantula this time that is exposed to radioactive material that somehow causes the spider to grow to gargantuan proportions.  Like many vintage sci-fi movies, viewers need to suspend their disbelief to enjoy the film but this one in particular makes it quite a challenge.<br />Leo G. Carrol plays distinguished biochemist Professor Deamer who lives like a hermit in a remote area outside a small Arizona town developing a synthetic nutrient out of a radioactive isotope.  While giving a brief tour of his home laboratory facilities to the town doctor Dr.Hastings (John Agar) and his newly arrived graduate assistant Stephanie (¡°Steve¡±) Clayton (Mara Corday), Deamer proudly touts this radioactive swill as the answer to world hunger.  Indeed, his laboratory animals from rabbits to monkeys exhibit fast growth rates in his experiments.  There¡¯s just one problem.  The isotope is unstable and unpredictable causing death in some animals.  As ¡°Steve¡± confides to Dr. Hastings, they must solve this problem before they can ever experiment on a human.  (Duh! And to say nothing of the ethical issues this would raise.)  This of course, doesn¡¯t dissuade his previous assistants who were impatient enough to try the formula for themselves. (Damn the rats and monkeys! It¡¯s got to work.) They subsequently contract a rare degenerative disease that disfigures their faces and bodies.  Despondent and angry, one of the hideous assistants survives long enough to attack Deamer in his laboratory and forcibly give him an injection as well.  The ensuing scuffle causes a fire anddamage to the facility enabling an abnormally large tarantula among the specimens to escape into the desert and wreak havoc throughout the county.<br />Finally, the plausibility of the film¡¯s premise is further belied by the fact that a tarantula¡¯s body structure couldn¡¯t possibly support its own weight at such a size.  Volume is cubed so the weight increases at a rate much faster than the size.  <br />Scientific inaccuracies aside, the scenes of the tarantula legs poking out and climbing over distant hillsides are unforgettable as are the accompanying musical scores.  This is certainly an entertaining and fun film even if only for laughs at times.
B00005KHJM|5.0|\\"the Wicker Man' is a delightful twist for horror afficianados. <BR>A constable gets an anonymous letter about a missing female child on local island. The island is known for its bounty of vegetation. He is a pious man; his underlings joke about his virginity. <BR> He sets off in his plane to investigate. The residents give him a hard time; they tease him and lie about the child he is looking for. <BR> As he investigates, he notices with revulsion blatant sexual displays, such as anantomical shaped pastries, trees cut to resemble penises and so on.  <BR> He finds mysterious information about the missing child. So he decides to overnight at the local inn. When the landlord's daughter emerges (Britt Eckland)a terrific bawdy song is sung by all- except our dour fellow. She enjoys the tune, but our pious investigator, who is not yet aware he is being led about by his nose, sure does. Disgusted to his core, he goes for a walk, only to find nearly the entire town fornicating in the local cemetery. <br /> As he tries to sleep, Britt, dances against the thin wall of the inn to disturb him. She is naked, hot and it is one darn erotic dance. Virgin man is in agony; he tries to ignore what he hears and tries even harder not abuse himself.  <BR> The next day is May Day. Everything on display is sexual.   Virgin guy meets with the Lord of the Island, Summerall (Christopher Lee in one of his best roles). He refuses to answer any questions, but implies to the constable a human sacrifice will be held on May Day so the fall fruit harvest will be bountiful again. The lord takes pleasure in teasing a man who is saving himslf for marriage; he shows him fertility dances of naked women and anything else that will shock the socks off pious boy. <BR>   Mr. Pious is determined to stop the sacrifice. The island celebrates the first of May the old fashion way. Costumes, dances, sword games and finally a bonfire at the beach. The investigator, blood boiling, manages to get in costume and go along with the festivities. <BR>Little does he know who the real sacrifice is going to be; the wicker man awaits its perfect victim.<br />Although this film is terribly 1970s, it is simply grand. it is what a horror movie once was, before everyone started slashing each other at lonely camping grounds in nasty masks. The clash of religion is interesting, because both make some sense. <BR>Loving film means owning 'The Wicker Man'.  <BR> Try it- it's one heck of a movie.
6305364648|4.0|Action movies generally make some attempt at credibility both in plot and in the action itself. \\"True Lies\\" does not and, in a strange way, it seems to be liberated by its total disregard for plausibility and ends up as one of the most entertaining movies of its type.<br />Harry Renquist (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a US federal agent working for an agency whose very existence is denied. His own wife, Helen Tasker, (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks that he is Harry Tasker, a rather boring computer salesman and that, when he is off saving the world, he is merely trying to sell a few computers to a foreign company.<br />He is perhaps a little too boring for Helen and she is just beginning to get involved with Simon (Bill Paxton) a used car salesman who is pretending to be a spy when her husband finds out and attempts to use the resources of his department to keep tabs on the two of them.<br />Meanwhile, his current assignment, an investigation into a Mid East terrorist group led by Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik) begins to become tangled up with his domestic affairs. With the help of Juno Skinner (Tia Carrere) an art dealer specialising in Persian antiquities, Aziz smuggles a batch of ex Soviet nuclear warheads into Florida. His plan is to detonate one as a demonstration and then to hold the US to ransom. As a sideline, he decides that he must kidnap and interrogate Renquist who has been getting a little too close in his investigation. That leaves Renquist/Tasker and his wife on an island with a soon to be detonated bomb and three other warheads headed off across the country.<br />Of course, you already know that Arnie will save the day and square things with his wife but plot and story line are really just a convenient peg on which to hang some gloriously indulgent action sequences.<br />As far as it goes, the acting is really all about Schwarzenegger and Curtis. Everyone else is pretty much incidental. Arnie strides through the action sections with his normal aplomb but he falls down badly when he is playing the part of the cuckolded husband. In that mode he is unconvincing. Curtis too is a bit of a let down. She seems to be walking rather woodenly through most of the film though she does wake up when she gets involved in the action. Art Malik does a decent job in the not too demanding role of Aziz the master terrorist. However Tia Carrere just hams it up too far in her role as Juno Skinner the beautiful but evil sidekick. None of this matters though as we are watching this film to see Arnie try to ride a horse off a skyscraper and rescue his daughter with a Harrier jet fighter.<br />There is action aplenty and the movie just keeps dishing it up. It it one of the few films that has actually made this reviewer's pulse rate rise. This movie does not let the audience catch  its breath. The stunts themselves are splendid. Of course they are almost universally implausible but they work.<br />As an action movie, this is about as good as it gets. The pace is sometimes a little frantic but as escapist enjoyment the film is a hit.
6305252521|5.0|I really liked this movie and I am going to be able to watch it over and over because of Jim. I am not a fan of Jim Carrey's usual comedy, but he did an excellent job as the lead actor here, I would definately want to check out any other movie he does with a serious role because he is good.  Just watch his restrained expression while &quot;mom&quot; makes him sit there with the photo album, he is subtle and conveys perfectly that painful moment that we all had to sit through with someone sometime.....but on with the movie, it is interesting, inspiring, entertaining. I am very happy that I own this movie because I know I will enjoy watching it many many more times.
B000001ELP|5.0|It's not the greatest KISS album and it's not the greatest concept album.  Both of those should be obvious.<br /><br />And yet, it has an odd greatness of its very own.  It has a naïvet&eacute; that's frankly charming.  The story is also surprisingly strong and the music is fascinating.  The combination of KISS with the strings and choir holds up remarkably well.<br /><br />\\"The Odyssey\\" is frankly one of the wackiest, pretentious concept songs ever, but it's one of the few things here I enjoy mostly as camp.  \\"Under The Rose\\" just flat rocks.  \\"Just A Boy\\" is genuinely pretty.  \\"A World Without Heroes\\" remains one of those unsung, so to speak, masterpieces that would be recognized if another artist has done it.<br /><br />To me, \\"Dark Light\\", with its overwrought lyrics, is the only thing I'm not very fond of.  A KISS album on which the Ace song is the low point for me, it's unique in nearly every way.<br /><br />I listen to this regularly.  More regularly than its intrinsic greatness would suggest.  I just find it deliciously entertaining and oddly real for an album of songs telling a fantasy story by a band that was clearly trying to hard.<br /><br />It would be a different world for KISS if this album had succeeded.  I'd be interested to learn more about that world, but then I love [[ASIN:B000001ELR Creatures of the Night]], too, so maybe I don't want to know too much about it.
B00005QIPH|4.0|There are very few instances where an artist' debut is so powerful that it blows everyone away such as The Pretenders, Ricki Lee Jones, Tracy Chapman and so on.  This almost falls into that category.  You see, you have to have a certain sense of confidence to pull it off.  You have to be more that confident, you have to be talented as well.  These guys have plenty of talent.  In fact, being that they are sooooo young, I am really surprised.  And maybe that's where the four stars came in.  I just get this sense that they knew what they wanted out of their music, but in some ways I can hear and see the suits behind them.  I just hope that this is a novelty  \\"garage band\\" pushed in one direction by a label to get some respect.  That would really suck.  On any note.  \\"Is This It\\" is a striking debut with a lot of authority and enough attitude to send you home feeling like there could not be a better band around today.  Be careful with that thought!
B00003CY0V|4.0|Opening scenes are great. You have Travolta talking about Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon and pushing the envelope. <br />So, What if Pacino killed everyone? How would that affect everyone? Travolta sure showed you off to push that envelope in the opening scenes of Swordfish with an incredible action explosion scene.<br />You have a good cast with a script that could be better, but you do have a few nice action scenes that is unforgettable. Jackman has a good performance as a hacker for Travolta's evil mind. <br />You also can't forget about the beautiful Halle Berry in which she does get a bit nude in this film. <br />As for Mr. Travolta...it's another ridiculous haircut and another bad performance from him. Nicholas Cage should of played the role of Travolta's...that's my opinion. <br />If you want to see Halle naked, some good action scenes, and another ridiculous performance by John Travolta...I recommend this film to you.

B00005LKHW|2.0|This movie is ok, I own it, but I wished ida saved my money.  This is a one time see movie, after that it becomes uninteresting.  The comedy in this movie is not witty at all, in fact, it almost insults your intelligence.  This is a rent once movie, nothing more.
1565847032|5.0|Many people are eager for a true alternative to the usual gang of talking heads (or shouting heads), pundits, etc, for commentary and analysis of political and social life. Noam Chomsky continues to offer such an alternative. However, people often find Chomsky's several dozen books on international affairs difficult to read; books of interviews with Chomsky tend to be much more popular than his own writings. The reason is simple: in the informal setting of an interview or the (often lengthy) question and answer periods that follow his talks Chomsky retains his remarkable ability to bring many topics together into a coherent response. He does this by drawing upon the same wealth of source material cited in his books, but the answers given in the casual setting flesh out Chomsky's keen sense of humor, his dedication to social justice and make for easier and even more interesting reading.<br />Carlos Otero realized this, about 15 years ago, and published \\"Language and Politics,\\" an excellent book flawed only by the lack of an index or footnotes. Mitchell and Schoeffel, with \\"Understanding Power,\\" have improved on Otero's book by providing an index and the much-requested and -needed footnotes. Everything in \\"Understanding Power\\" is well documented. So well documented that the notes are longer than the book itself! To handle this the editors have set up a web site especially for this book, where notes may be down-loaded (or read on-line) in either HTML or PDF format.<br />This book, almost all of which is in print for the first time, is at once a very accessible introduction to Chomsky's political thought as well as an excellent addition to the library of the most serious Chomsky critic or enthusiast.
B00005JKT8|3.0|Okay, you've read the reviews and you are ready to see a twenty first century woman swept off her feet by a handsome 19th century duke.  The promise of creating the myth we all adore is strong.  Hugh Jackman is your typical tall, dark and handsome, perfect for the part of the gallant duke.  I would definitely like to see a film with Hugh Jackman again.  Meg Ryan as the harried, aggressive career woman, though not thoroughly convincing, is acceptable.  The failing here is in the plot.  The time travel element here runs head on into the time paradox problem--much of which could have been solved with some different editing in the last half hour or so of the movie.  For me, there were too many inconsistencies to create the so-called happy ending.  It felt strained and contrived.  It may have been much better to go for the tear-jerker ending, and keep the time lines clean(as in Twelve Monkeys).  This would have been perfect, considering the foreshadowing given in Kate's description to Leopold of Prince Charles and Lady Di's marriage as \\"a cautionary tale.\\"<br />Overall, a pleasant film, but not worth premium theater dollar.  Rent it when it comes out on DVD.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Everything about this film is just incredible. <BR>Starting off from the title sequence of Crowe's handwriting to the ending. <br />The score is just magnificent! Crowe always throws in great music in his films. <br />You get great performances from Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Jason Lee, Kate Hudson, and especially from Patrick Fugit. <br />The style of directing is A+ directing once again from Mr. Crowe. <br />I must say that Almost Famous got robbed of the Oscars. Steven Sodenburg for Best Director?!? Gladiator for Best Picture?!? You have to be kidding! <br />The film is very mesmorizing, and also very inspirational. I recommend this film to everyone, especially to the music lovers out there.
B00005221M|5.0|It has been years since I saw the VHS version of the movie, so I cannot comment on the differences between the director's cut on DVD and the theater version available on VHS.  I will say that Chingatchgook's diatribe at the end of the DVD about the white man coming and wrecking the land is very out of context and very cheesy.  The DVD version should end as the VHS version and the book do, with Chingatchgook saying, &quot;...I, Chingatchgook, last of the Mohicans.&quot;<br />This is a great movie!  I am so moved by Daniel Day Lewis' performance.  His character, Nathaniel, is a great example of the self-possessed warrior-man who finds and wins the golden-haired girl.  (See Robert Bly's Iron John.)  Nathaniel is so free from deriving his sense of self from the opinions of others that he is able to completely give himself to Cora, once he realizes that she is free to completely receive his love--and his wildness.
6305165912|5.0|Let me say this:<BR>This is without a doubt, i'll repeat that, without a doubt the best and funniest movie of all time.  Since I bought this movie, two years ago, it has not left the bottom tray of my dvd player.  I watch it so often that if it where on VHS the picture would already be as worn and faded as if it where 20 years old.  The characters and one liners from this movie are unforgetable, and, if you watch it enough times you will probably start talking like the Dude with acessive use of the word &quot;man&quot; and the exagerated pauses between words.  <BR>I must say that for the people that gave this movie only one star, they must only have 2 or 3 brain cells working to not be able to appreciate the witty humor of this movie.  Do yourself a favor and see the movie for yourself.  There is a reason why 99.8 percent of the reviews cant say enough about it.  Basically, you shouldn't own a dvd player if your not going to own this movie, simple as that.
B00003CXCS|5.0|The Sound of Music is simply the BEST!!!!!!!!!

0553269631|4.0|One of the most amazing things about The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is that Carson McCullers was only 23 when she wrote this.  The writing in this novel is incredible. I think the reader should be prepared for the fact that this story is melancholy and can be depressing at times, but at the same time is brilliant in its character depth and social understanding. I wish I would have read this novel in highschool as there is clearly a lot of symbolism and statement that would lead to great discussions. The center of this novel is John Singer a deaf-mute who is feeling abandoned after his life-long friend Antonapoulos is sent away to a distant hospital. The novel introduces us to 4 lives: a young girl named Mick who grows up in poverty; Dr. Copeland, an African-American doctor; Jake Blount a wandering alcoholic and Biff Brannon a cafe owner. We learn the loneliness and pain of each of these characters and watch as each one is drawn to the mute, John Singer. McCullers details her novel with many truths about the human spirit, as well as some political and social statements of her own. It is said that much of the novel is autobiographical as McCullers was raised in a small southern town, primarily by her African-American maid. I would suggest that the reading of this novel is coupled with a little research about McCullers and some background info on the novel for full appreciation. Upon completion I am glad that I read this and can appreciate it for all that it offers and is trying to say.
B000002LR3|5.0|Looking back and looking forward, Gillespie and company mined the Stones and inspired the ravers, all in this one great record. If commercial radio had any sense, these guys would be stars, but we all know it doesn't. I'm glad I had enough sense to pick this up in 1991; I've cherished it since. With Matthew Sweet's &quot;Girlfriend,&quot; this was one of the two best records of that year. (And yeah, yeah, &quot;Nevermind&quot; was terrific. But this is better.) Met Gillespie in Ohio when the band was touring for &quot;Give Out But Don't Give Up,&quot; and told him I thought they were (at that point) the greatest band in the world. (Well, they were, for a brief time. Also, see &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; and &quot;XTRMNTR&quot;...) He was less than polite: &quot;Yeah, fine, g'bye, leave,&quot; was what I thought he said. Broke my heart. But I STILL think this is a great record. And for me to overcome my pride and say THAT is something. So. Go on, get the record.
0783226063|1.0|Dune is a very long book so that it is hard to fit the elements into a film. The going rate is that a film can tell a short story. <br />Dune is in reality the re-telling of the story of Mohamed. A person has some insights and finds some desert warriors to follow him. They have been trained to live through hardship and are able to defeat the corrupt forces of the Byzantine and Persian Empires although hopelessly outnumbered. They set up the Caliphate which dominates the world for hundeds of years. <br />Dune is set on a desert planet and the hero of the story is the son of a merchant. His family have been given the planet which can generate enormous wealth as it produces something rare. The evil Harkonan family however want the planet back and they invade. Our hero is driven into the desert but stages a Geurilla war with the help of desert tribesman and not only regains his family plantet but the world. <br />The problem with the film is that it is like a very potted summary of a long novel. In the novel the events define the characters and why they are good and bad. Because there is not time to do this in the film, the baddies are shown to be physically grotesque and addicted to eating live cows to establish that they are on the wrong side. The heroes are such because they look more attractive and dess more tastefully. The villians also live in a tasteless abode and have appalling manners. The heros also live in cooler pads and have more tasteful decorations.  <br />The book creates a sort of feudal society in which the main characters have endless sword fights. The basis of this is the invention of force field technology which makes projectile weapons inefective. In reality of course this is done so that Herbert can write a novel based on personal heroism rather than on characters who keep elaborate trading records. The film has a brief bizarre scene at the begining to illustrate this but then leaves the idea behind. One has the impression that a lot of editing has occured. <br />What hits you about this film is the almost continually grotesque nature of the imagery and the very abreviated story. It is all pretty dreadful.
0783225792|5.0|An awsome movie about the mafia owned casinos of early Las Vegas.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Peci give steller performances as usual.  A must have for every DVD collection.  You will not be dissapointed. - Trust me
0790729709|4.0|The movie was extremely entertaining ... however, I was disappointed that there were some very important scenes in the theatre and TV presentations that were edited out in the DVD. If the DVD was un-edited I would have given this movie a five star rating!
6302517036|3.0|Chris Sarandon is terrific as Jerry Dandridge, the charming neighborhood vampire. In watching his performance one evening after I bought this tape, I finally understood why it was that the vampire story will never die, no matter how many stakes get driven into its heart: the near-death ecstasy and the orgasmic ecstasy are biochemically identical. Whether it is the act of creating human life or the act of taking it away- the human physical response is the same.  With the tale of the vampire, when the male vampire is in the act of ostensibly making love to his victim, we get both actions [ostensibly giving and taking] the same time.  The raw power of the scene in the book, \\"Dracula,\\" where the vampire baptizes Mina with his own blood, adds a third element to this powerful biochemical mix: a spiritual element, a religious esctasy.  We don't have this in \\"Fright Night\\", but instead we have the setting of an entirely normal central character and his friends, in an average town in Anywhere, America.  This \\"brings it home\\" in an unexpected way, as the spiritual aspect is replaced by a social one.  Context is the difference, one which is exploited very well.  And of course, the struggle of a fatherless boy trying to grow into manhood and the man finds himself fixating on [the vampire] adds another dimension.  The vampire has been a man and moved beyond it; Charley wants to be a man and finds that he is both helpless and threatened by the vampire.  And of course, the vampire is just as helpless under certain conditions and threatened by almost everything in the ordinary daylight world- Charley through the looking glass.<br />Roddy McDowell shines in his role as the washed-up B-movie star.  The supporting cast is also very good.  And the music isn't even bad-- very 80's, but this adds to its charm.
0783114893|5.0|This film is not really about much at all. You will not emerge from the cinema a better or more intelligent person. It is however an effective well crafted horror thriller. <br />A young man is driving a car across America. He picks up a hitcher who is clearly a psycopathic killer and is perhaps something more. He is able to escape but as he travells across America he is followed by the killer. <br />The role of the killer is played by Rutger Hauer. He is brilliant in the role and is able to convery a sense of both menance and evil. <br />The film is not one that has many scenes which are gross outs or filled with horror yet the film has an absolute tension which goes from scene to scene. It is a consumately brilliant film from a technical point of view.
B00005LC4B|5.0|In my opinion this movie is Robert DeNiro's best performance, and best movie.  Rob plays Max Cady, an ex-convict that is bent upon revenge against his lawyer and his family for having held back evidence in a rape case that could have made him walk.  I cant even begin to describe how awesome this movie is.  No Dvd Collection is complete without it.  If you liked Silence of the Lambs, Psyco, American Psyco, then this is for you.  Although the movie is very gory, the main reason why it is so chilling is because Max Cady is the worst nightmare of society.  Not only is he purely evil, and violent, he is also highly intellectual and brilliant.  He is the most dangerous types of men.  And Max Cady's are out there.  <BR>    Once again, increadable film, awsome cast, get it.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  More original than I thought it would be.  The first hour, or so, simply scared ..me.  I have to admit though, the monster was a little dissapointing, ONLY AT FIRST, then I realized the cleverness behind the story.  I watched the movie a second time the next night and even liked it more the second time.
6301247485|3.0|Mia Farrow gets slammed a lot for sinking this film, but I don't think the criticism is deserved.  Her Daisy is charming, flighty, playful, irresponsible and probably a little stupid.  But she epitomizes the upper class that Gatsby is so desperately trying to fit into, which display all these features.  \\"The best thing a girl can be in this world, \\" Daisy philosophizes to Nick, \\"is a beautiful little fool.\\"  Lovely to look at, charming to be around but undemanding and demanding nothing. Everything must be given to her, for by herself she is worth nothing.  Daisy is an ornament, and very little more.  Mia Farrow plays her that way. Gatsby does not love her because he is enchanted by her character or admires her mind....he is obsessed with her because she represents a prize for which he can never really compete.  For upper class men, the woman one marries is of vital importance because she completes the \\"set\\" of things you must have in order to play the upper class \\"game.\\"  Gatsby knows that, and he knows that Daisy would secure his entrance into the \\"game\\" because she has the look, the attitude, the very *smell* and *sound* of money. She was born to it and bred with it surrounding her all the time.  Moreover, she has all the right physical qualities: beautiful, charming, and not too bright. I think where Redford makes a mistake is in trying to play Gatsby as a man who loves Daisy for the person she is rather than the class she represents.  Bruce Dern is almost perfect as Daisy's husband Tom.  Tom is completely secure in the knowledge that money can buy literally anything, and he has more than enough to get him everything he could ever want. Money will solve all of his problems for him, because money is the one thing that hardly anyone ever has quite enough of.  And many, many people don't have enough to buy what they need to survive.  This gives an enormous amount of power to someone who has more than he will ever need or, for that matter, more than he would want.  He says at the end that he and Daisy have had times together that Gatsby could never understand, and he's right.  Daisy knows her place and her role, and Tom is both happy and grateful that she can fulfill and play both so well; the times together he refers to are when they are playing their stereotypical roles together perfectly, artlessly and without any thought-- the product of a lifetime of training and practice. Jay Gatsby does not understand either the upper class \\"game,\\" or the \\"roles\\" nor have any inkling of its final \\"goal.\\"  In the end, this is because he is at heart a decent human being and cannot be anything else.  To be so rich that you need be held responsible for nothing is almost identical to absolute power corrupting absolutely, for it boils down to the same thing.  Gatsby pays the price; rich people never pay.  Sam Waterston is an excellent Nick Carroway.  The rest of the supporting cast also is outstanding.  And of course the music is wonderful, the sets are fabulous and the art direction first-rate.
B00003CX5P|2.0|The original Star Wars films were what cinema is all about. Well scripted escapism which showed imagination and vigour. Star Wars itself was important in freeing woman characters from being love objects or plot focuses. It allowed them to become characters in themselves. <br />Star Wars 1 is a beautifully made film. The sets, the effects the photography are all brilliant. The problem is the plot and execution. <br />Jar Jar Binks is one of the most annoying characters to enter the film world. Black market copies of this film are being sold now with him being digitally removed from every scene. <br />The notion that a 15 year old girl could be elected to run a planet is also a fantasy which is clearly designed to make the film appeal to a younger target group. In much the same way the development of the Anakin Skywaler character is again aimed at the youth market. However in reality would some adults allow a 10 year old to engage in a dangerous car race to enable them to get some money to buy an engine? There are some plot points which are so unrealistic that they grate. <br />The forces of evil in this film use robots to fight for them. These robots are incredibly bad shots who never seem to hit anything. Clearly the main thrust of the film is to provide an explanation for the emergence of autocratic rule in the Star Wars universe. However the character who is to emerge as the evil emperor is such a greaser one could not imagine him getting a job in a small shop let alone running the universe. His emergence over the next few episodes will only be possible if the other characters have major brain surgery which reduces their intelligence.
B00005LKHW|2.0|This movie is ok, I own it, but I wished ida saved my money.  This is a one time see movie, after that it becomes uninteresting.  The comedy in this movie is not witty at all, in fact, it almost insults your intelligence.  This is a rent once movie, nothing more.
0312932081|5.0|I hadn't heard of Ender's Game when I first read it, but the moment I finished it, I made certain that all my friends heard of it. This was the one of the best books I have ever read. I know people who hate reading, and even they love it. It's as though you can hear Ender's mind thinking out his every move. It's brilliantly written. Ender is an intriguing character-he's a likable hero and a screwed up kid at the same time. This isn't just a book for sci-fi readers, either. It has enough aspects besides the futuristic aliens and such to make it interesting to most anyone. I, and everyone I know who had read it, highly recommend it.
B00000J7EI|5.0|One of the TOP 50 Death Metal CD's ever released. This album belongs to NWOSDM (New Wave Of Swedish Death Metal) which characterizes extreme complexity and improvisation of the guitars, playing almost always different riffs and melodies, of which there are plethora in each song. What caracterizes this music is the, what I call, \\"Clever Riffs and Melodies,\\" meaning neither brutal, nor very melodic music, but catchy-it sticks in your mind after. This album is the successor of At The Gates' \\"Slaughter of the Soul\\" and the continuation of the tradition in more technical, at times more melodical, conceptions.<BR>I absolutely guaranty that no human being who enjoys Death Metal will not like this masterpiece. To me it is in the TOP 10 of my 500 CD collection.<BR>Be wise and buy it...
0553275976|3.0|This book by Tom Wolfe was interesting to a point. It gives a<BR>good characterization of the many types of people that you will find in New York City. You have the Wall Street types,you have a black activist,you have society ladies. The book stays bogged bogged down in this routine tom the point of being nearly boring.<BR>It becomes difficult to read after a point. I have read no more Tom Wolfe books after I read this one.Find this one in a used book store.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|Immediatly after seeing the movie, I wanted to buy the soundtrack... I have to say this particular version is an awesome piece of work, especially with the neat leather-bound cover, and the booklet... <br />One thing I miss though... When the party is in Moria, the choir is awesome. If you saw the movie, I'm talking about the part right before the bridge on Khazad-Dum. They get chased by goblins (or Orcs), who flee when the Balrog approaches. The party flees, and Boromir almost falls into a crevice. The choir is doing an excellent part right there (it was my favourite part in the movie anyway, but the music just heightened the mood), and that's not on the Cd. I can only hope a more extensive, or another CD will be released on which that particular part will be featured. Other than that, I still love the CD.
B00005YTFG|5.0|This movie is the best musical i've ever seen...<BR>Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are awesome together!<BR>I love this movie and i definitely recommend it!
0446364495|1.0|I have to say honestly, I saw the movie before I read the book, and I liked the movie a lot!  I love Meryl Streep, but Clint Eastwood gives me the heebie jeebies....so needless to say, as I'm reading the book (after I saw the movie) and the author is writing about how Robert Kincaid is supposed to be this sexy older man, I'm trying to keep my lunch down!  Yuck.  I'm sorry but the image of Clint Eastwood ruined it for me...it was horrible enough watching him kiss and make love to Francesca  in the movie...they totally should have has someone like...I don't know...Robert Redford play the part of Robert Kincaid....Clint Eastwood needs to stick to the Dirty Harry movies....not love stories....this book might have had potential, but I just can't get that old man out of my mind.

B00005O3VC|5.0|What can be said about one the best comedies in movie's history? <br />The cast from Monty Python made it their goal to create a movie that is silly as hell, and yet will have you struggling to keep your tears from laughing so hard.<br />King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his trust servant Patsy (Terry Gilliam) travel through medieval England. On their way there, they encounter some of the strangest people you'll have ever seen (Including, but not limited to 'The Knights Who Say NI', an invincible Black Knight, a Constitutional Peasant, and a king who was determined to build a castle in a swamp). <br />While they travel and gather companions to join them in the court of Camelot, they are given a mission by God himself. Arthur must set out and find the Holy Grail.<br />In itself an easy enough task, but as his knights scatter across the country, they each become entangled in various perils (Imagine Sir Galahad the Pure being trapped in a castle of virgins who are dying to be spanked). <br />The end is sort of an anti-climax, but the legendary individual scenes more than make up for it. From it come numerous hilarious quotes that are frequently used by fans worldwide.<br />All in all, a movie that you HAVE to have seen, even if it was just to know how to react when someone tells you to go cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring.<br />The extras on the DVD are probably worth it just to the fans of the flick, but I have yet to meet a person who saw the movie and didn't like it.<br />Remember that during this movie, if you're going to be drinking, better swallow it down fast unless you want your fellow-viewers stuck in fluid.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Basicly this is the greatest anime in the genre. With the added extras like interviews, stills and a new voice tracks it gets overwhelming the greatness this addition gives.
B000002UA0|5.0|I think that &quot;Piper at the gates of dawn&quot; is a magnificent piece of work. It hasn't been too long that I've been listening to Pink Floyd. Why? Well, for one reason, my tastes were somewhere else in the music industry for 20 years. It's only been a year now that we have been playing Pink Floyd music regularly in the house.<br />What pleases me the most is that the cd is remastered, so the sound is as if we were in the studio at the time of recording.<br />To me, all the songs are great, and each one sets a unique mood when playing them.<br />Barret, Waters, Gilmour and Mason make a fine team because of the style the band had at the time.<br />I can't believe the review that someone did recently on &quot;Piper...&quot;. It was totally obnoxious and deceiving.<br />It's cool that all the lyrics are included in this wonderful album. Unfortunately, I was not born in the era when the LP was released. That was before me. My partner was around then, and of course, he knew them. Too bad for me, But that's a totally different story.<br />The songs which reach out to me the most are:<br />Astronomy Domine, Lucifer Sam, Interstellar Overdrive, The Gnome and Bike.<br />Piper at the gates of dawn has a taste of science fiction all over. It also reminds me a bit of the hippie style of music.<br />No, I have no regrets buying the cd, and if anyone wonders why someone so young would want music that dates back to a totally earlier generation, my answer is &quot;because the music is so communicatable.<br />One song in particular comes to mind when I write this. The song is track 7. Lucifer Sam. It reminds me of the theme music to a Batman or Scooby Doo cartoon. That is only my own mind talking out loud. Sorry if it offended anyone. Bike sort of grew on me every time we played the disc. Now, the song is no longer annoying, because I am used to the weird, one of a kind music of PF. The Gnome reminds me of summer. That's when we opened our windows in the car and let the cd blast. Does that tell you how much I like the cd?<br />The booklet is loaded with psychedelic photos and graphics of the band too. Quite artistic. I find with bands from before the 80's, the graphics inside their albums were more elegantly designed with many colours than today's.<br />This is the tracklist:<br />1-Astronomy Domine  2-Lucifer Sam  3-Matilda Mother  4-Flaming<br />5-Pow R. Toch H.  6-Take up thy stethoscope and walk<br />7-Interstellar Overdrive  8-The Gnome  9-Chapter 24  10-Scarecrow<br />11-Bike<br />So remember, if you like psychedelic and Sci-fi style music, then Pink Floyd's &quot;Piper at the gates of Dawn&quot; is definitely for you.<br />That goes out to all you new-comer PF shoppers like me.<br />Hope my review has helped.that tell you how much I like the cd? <br />The booklet is loaded with psychedelic photos and graphics of the band too.

B00005JKGV|4.0|Got lucky with this one. Been a Lynch's fan for at least 4 years. Not crazy about all of his work, but... Was particularly impressed with Lost Highway. Seen it 5 (make it 6) times on VHS. Had been looking for DVD version for some time now. ... - its well worth the money! Don't expect miracles out of DVD. Regardless - the transfer is excellent, far superior image and sound quality, as with some (far from all) DVDs. Well worth it! Good luck!
B00000JPH0|5.0|as far as military movies go, the winter war is as good as it gets. the movie hardley misses a point. the action scenes are great and (imagine this) historically accurate! the combination really develops. the smallarms, vehicles, fighters and bombers were all loaned from a museum in russia and the tactics were re-inacted  from the actual russo-finish war veterans on both sides. be right there in the trenches as you get strafed by fighters, shelled from artillery and fired at by snipers. you hardly want to look down to read the subtitles as you may miss the action (incidentially, there is a finnish-only version approximately 1 hour longer in length). 100% accurately depicted and well acted. highly recomended from a hard sell military buff.don't wait to buy it used, it's worth every cent brand new and if you liked it as much as i did, you'll wear it out anyway.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The Japaness did it again and made another great anime. Princess Mononoke is a grand story of man and nature, of evil and good and how they must learn to coexist. The one thing that should make this a great is the use of famous voices but all this aside the animation can only compare to itself. This will be forever one of the greats end of story.
0553213105|5.0|O.K. I would call myself a well-versed reader in popular books. I would also call Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen quite possibly the most well-written book in the past 300 years.<br />  As soon as you pick up this book, your mind is forming hypothoses about the rest of the book. The weird thing is that ABSOLUTLY NONE of them happen. Yet, at the end, you are not only as happy with the conclusion as you would have been with your own ideas, but happier. That kind of literary psycological euphoria cannot be and has not been acheived by any other author that I have ever read.<br />  This book leaves you with a feeling of absolute feclicity. I cried with joy the first time I read it, and had to reread the ending twice. In other words, it has a very happy ending! That has certainly been attempted by every tale from Cinderella to the Harry Potter books, yet Austen's ending is unique as her ending is perfectly real. It not only seems realistic, but, in hindsight, any other resolution to her book seems ludicrous.<br />  Her characters are vivid. They are complex yet you see them as if they could be you own mother, sister, father, brother, friend, foe, or aquaintance. You not only warm to her heroes and heroines, but Austen leads you to feel a fiery hatred of her vilains and vilainesses.<br />  Her writing is intricate. You are left feeling not only perfectly satisfied with this book, but want more. She is not only an excalent writer but a perfect one. Thius book is her masterpiece. It has comedy, tradjedy, richness, irony, love, and loss. It many complex facets gleam like diamonds. I am in awe of this book. I beseach you: READ PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!
B00005OCMR|4.0|While many people may view the plot of Tron as lackluster, I feel that Tron does have a type of analogy that is extremeley relevant today: the concept of a monopolistic software company taking over programs produced by other companies and using all sorts of techniques to force the user to communicate only with programs created by the monopolistic software company. In short, Microsoft would be an equivalent of the Master Control Program.<br />The only downside to the movie is the character development. I would have liked the character Flynn to show more shock at his own creations and how his own creations have been used against him. He did show shock when he passed by the enemy tanks while fleeing on a lightcycle, but that wasn't enough.
006092988X|5.0|There's a lot to be said about B.Smith's &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, but I will simply say this.  There's nothing else like it anywhere.

B0000028UK|5.0|This the second pearl jam album and the last one I like. It's a great album from start to finish. There are great 'grunge' songs like go and animal to accoustic songs like elderly women behind the counter in a small time to a song like W.M.A. Vs. really shows why pearl jam is one of the 90s best albums.
B000051Y0G|4.0|This is a great CD, Cyndi Laper has a nice distinctive voice. My favorite songs on the CD are Money Changes Everything, Girls Just Want To Have Fun, Time After Time, and All Through The Night, but my favorite Cyndi Lauer song of all time is Time After Time, when ever I hear that song on the radio I have to stop what I'm doing and listen to it but usually when I turned my radio on or change the station the song is usually almost finished, and now since I recently bought this CD I can listen to it whenever I want and I can hear the whole song from beginning to end!
0792844882|5.0|Elizabeth Berkly and Gina Gershon are by far the most beautiful women on film and just as seductive as Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly in the film Bound. These showgirls lit up the Vegas stage with hot dance moves and sexual passion. Elizabeth thumbs a ride to Vegas to become a dancer. She soon graduates from a strip club dancer to being a showgirl dancer. The movie really takes off when Elizabeth competes with Gina to become the lead dancer in the show Goddess. The movie has good dance scenes and a awesome scene of Gina in a short silver dress and Elizabeth walking nude along the pool. I do not know if the film accurately depicts the life of a Vegas showgirl but the film accurately depicts the beautiful body of Elizabeth and Gina.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Just as the Sticker on the CD Cover says \\"The best Songs of a Decade\\"...this is truly an amazing collection!...as Madonna said, she based her choices on the tracks that u can listen over and over and u would never be sick of them! and the tracklisting order flows amazingly...this is a Cd that u can listen over and over and always would sound fresh and FUN.<BR>In this selection you can find all possible mixtures of pop music, every track represents a stage in Madonna's Career and pop history, i can deffinatly see why songs as You'll See or Rain,even This Used To be My Playground are missing; First.- those belong to another collection named \\"Something To Remember\\", Second.-;those 3 songs does not match the type of collection that GHV2 is, and Third.-; u can't really listen Rain or This Used To be My Playgroung wthout getting sick and tyred of them!! and those 2 ain't that kind of strong songs!.<BR>Deeper and Deeper and Erotica; Both amazing, such a dark but joyful work, very original tunes and playful lyrics...each track on this collections stands for being extremely well recorded and powerfull...there are no wrongs here! i've never heard tracks that well produced, written and recorded!!.<BR>I don't get why some people trashes tracks such as Don't Cry For me Argentina (which is Madonna's Voice at her best), Bedtime Story (written by Bjrk...this is not Electronic dance or trace nor House...this is Bjrk-Pop!! the lyrics is what Bjrk thinks that Madge Would say if she has to stop using words \\"Let's get Unconcious Honey\\", \\"let's go with MY flow baby\\" -Bjrk meant.), Drowned World/Substitute For Love (Maybe madonna's songwritting skills at her best...honest lyrics, powerfull song...not an American Hit but an European One...besides ...she named her tour after this song...).<BR>and talking about the other tracks..well they are unreplaceable and each one Unique!!.<BR>One of the things that(made me angry)about the Immaculate Collection was the fact that she used Remixes and12\\" versions for some songs...when the single versions or album edits where superb!!(except for Express Yourself)...but tracks as \\"like a preyer\\" did dissapointed me 'cause i LOVE the rocky album version...but, thank god that with GHV2 we have the \\"Pure\\" versions of the songs as they should be listened to...just like a time capsule.<BR>And last but not least, the album Artwork which collects all the Madonnas from the past 20 years (focusing more on the last 10 years of her career)...the package it's extremely well done and amazingly beautiful...<BR>ABSOLUTLY NO REGRETS!!<BR>THIS IS AN AMAZING COLLECTION!!
B00005O438|4.0|The reason all you people hate this is because it's not about gore, it's about suspense. All you people probably like gory movies. Stephen King movies are about suspense and thrills not just gore. I would suggest a Scream Movie.<br />This is a great suspenseful movie. They should of extended the movie to two hours ( instead of 1 hour and a half ) to tell more of the story. If you haven't seen this yet I would suggest reading the book first to know the whole story.<br />If you like the movie buy it, if you don't then your just plain CrAzY!!!![....]
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is the best cd I ever bought, but I haven't bought many, less than 20....you see, I am not much of a music fan, especially country - but after watching the movie several times I decided to buy the cd and now play it in my car all the time. There are one or two songs on the cd that I really enjoy. Heck; I am even looking into buying other cds by Alison Kraus and the Cox Family.  That is why I am here today<br />There is something about it all, almost a patriotic thing, reliving America's  early days. Simple, yet beautiful songs of a time in America that many have forgotten. <br />I was disappointed reading  the various articles about the country music awards ceremony. It appeared to me today's country music promoters were taken by surprise that so many people loved these songs, which do not fit into the mold they want to sell as country music today. No hype, no sex, no fancy special effects, just plain and simple songs - definitely not what the country music industry wants to do today. They just don't get it...never will, guess that is why I will never be a country music fan.
B00005OAA6|1.0|what can i say about a total and uptight,low life, very tasteless music, cannot sing at all, trying to be better than Kylie Minogue, and thinking she can get away with it.<br />I listened to her album before i bought Kylies album and let me tell you the truth, i went back to the store and asked for a refund but the store would not let me and did you know what i did? I basically asked the girl to swap it for Kylie's \\"Fever\\" album.<br />The album is basically trying to become a Celine Dion TRY HARD and the irony of it all is that the album was not selling well and who would blame anyone, it is like a girl trying to be a singer with the most copied melodies you could ever think of!<br />ONE LINE REVIEW:<BR>BUY KYLIE MINOGUE \\"FEVER\\" IT BEATS VICTORIA BECKHAM ANYTIME. <br />And antoher thing, watch out for her, if you see Victoria Beckham, give her the Kylie album \\"FEVER.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Nothing like Dylan has ever done, except for his willingness to offer something, anything different than anyone could expect.  Yet, that's what Dylan fans expect, the unexpected.  Folk, jazz, swing, blues, and a little country make this a true tribute to the artist himself as well as what is very American in recorded music.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I watched this movie, expecting to hate it...and at first, I did.  But the moment Ewan began singing Elton John's classic, \\"This Song's For You,\\" I was captivated.  I've seen it now three times, and love it more each time.  I've bought the soundtrack.  I'm buying the DVD, and I do not buy many movies.  This movie is beyond words it's so good.  If it doesn't get nominated for an Oscar, Hollywood is brain-dead.  Go see this movie!
B00005QZWI|5.0|As another reviewer mentioned before, if you don't notice the music, it fits. This is very true. At the same time, however, every listen is to relieve the movie again.<BR>The real centerpiece of the album is Enya's finale, the stunning &quot;May It Be&quot; which was nominated for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes this year. Worthwhile purchase.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This album features a collection of Madonna's Greatest songs each song on this album represents a time from Erotica to Music.  It is definately worth it to buy it.  Afterall, everyone should have something from the QUEEN OF POP!
0345413377|5.0|An amazing book that is definetly worth reading (it's better to read it if you've read the other two)! I wish I had a DAEMON! The only complaint I have is about the ending, it's too sad and abrupt.  However this book still gets my rating as the best book ever written! Read it!
B000002Q88|4.0|I was an early Kansas fan who lost interest in the band in the middle Eighties. I looked at the fellow members reveiws and decided to take a chance as I have a hard time with the 90's and current music scene (aagh). This is a very solid prog/pop album with a majority of the songs being very well (Ghosts is hauntingly beautiful) written. Most of the songs musically flow along with the lyrics. It does however sound alittle awky on a few songs. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this album to any prog/rock fan especially at this price.
6303109950|3.0|I used to love this movie, but as I've developed my tastes, my opinions have definitely gone down. Tombstone is filled with so many cheesy moments and shots that sometimes I have to turn the other way. Like when Wyatt Earp is pointing a gun at someone, its thundering out, and he's screaming, \\"Hell's coming with me!\\" Just about anything Josephine -the singer, actress- says makes me gag. The saving grace to this movie comes from Doc Holiday, played masterfully by Val Kilmer. Only in him do we see a character go through mental changes in a world rife with violence and insolence, not a hospitable environment for introspection. Moreoever, he persistently delivers great one liners and witty threats to the enemies that he gives almost an outside the box look at what is going on right in front of him, as it happens. This gives some of the movie's themes -having gain peace by enforcing justice with more violence- much more complexity, since Holiday both looks down on other ruffians and also indulges in violence himself. Were it not for this character, Tombstone would be another \\"Yee haw! Wyatt!\\" romanticized, historically inaccurate, Western.
B000002AD0|5.0|You can put this record on for the same reasons you put most jazz albums on. Which is not to say this is jazz, cause it ain't. But it's so much more than rock, where it's likely to be listed. Santana aimed at something different than the jazz musicians of 1968 but 33 years later these jams come across with so many of the same attributes a great jazz performance can bring that it begs to be played and listened to as if it were a jazz record.

0446677450|4.0|Readers, don't get me wrong, Rich Dad Poor Dad had me extremely skeptical before I read it. When I read it, however, I was extremely enlightend. Not because Kiyosaki told me exactly what to do, that wasn't the point of the book, but instead he gave me financial principles that contradict those given in today's educational institutions. <br />Is Kiyosaki outlandish for saying that school is unneeded? It depends on who you ask. I argue that most reviewers who scorned him for his comments are simply angry because that's the pathway they revere so highly. In fact, Kiyosaki never told readers not to get an education, however, he said that you shouldn't get a standard college education that merely prepares you to get a job. Kiyosaki endorses that the reader be educated &quot;in school smarts, street smarts, and financially.&quot; <br />What readers need to be aware of is that he probably isn't rich as he says he is and that the character Rich Dad probably doesn't exist. By no means does that discredit his messages of principles.<br />The reader must take into consideration that Kiyosaki makes several allusions that indicates that he is an extremely educated man. Therefore, take the principles and use them as PRINCIPLES to achieving wealth, not the solution to achieving wealth because I believe that that would only make one's situation worse. If one reads Rich Dad Poor Dad and then immediately starts investing or incorporates himself then the reader misunderstood the books purpose and totally bought into a &quot;Get Rich Quick&quot; mentality that haunts the entire book. In short, take Kiyosaki's sound financial principles and expand into legitimate, non-commercialized forms of education.

B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has been a group of mystery for the many years of their existance, yet we all must admit - Maynard is brilliant; Tool is brillaint; rock/art/metal would not be the same without them.  Dark and thought-provoking, Tool's bold lyrics captivate its audience and refuses to let them go.  Not afraid to give fans what rock is all about, Tool constructs artsy pieces ranging from five to twelve minutes in length; the majority being lengthy.  While mellow and shadowy, Laterlus features metal-ish, head-banging rock with an introspective twist (i.e Parabola, Ticks &amp; Leeches).<br />Maynard's voice is simply made to go with these low-strung riffs and the band's unbeleivingly strong bass.  Bass and rythm is the foundation of music, and Tool's varrying percussion work and heavy bass provide amazing support for the lyrics and melody. Old fans, new fans - this album is for everyone!<br />Technically, production is clean and crisp; we don't get the fuzzy stuff expeirenced with earlier albums.  In comparison to earlier works, I have to admit Tool's changed - for better or for worse, it is the fan's decision (personally, I vote for the better).  Straying from the metal we've come to love from Tool, the band explores the mysterious corridors of art-rock and succeeds.  <br />Over seventy minutes of solid music awaits you, and Tool's got talent and length that more than account for the cash you spend.
B00003CXA4|5.0|GANDHI is one of the greatest films ever released in the past twenty years. Mohandes Gandhi'sa life, from a young attorney and on through India's independence from England, is brilliantly captured, with a peformance that is still Ben Kingsley's best one ever. He deservedly won that Oscar he got. One thing I find remarkable about this film is it's ability to be exciting without much action, music, or dialogue. This is a film that I believe people of every religion will enjoy. Hey, I'm a Christian teen, and I find this film to be absolutely incredible! Nobody ever knew that a man of Gandhi's stature could win India it's independence without lifting a hand in anger. Remarkable! Do not miss GANDHI! Once you watch it, yo'll never regret it! Trust me! This one's a keeper! I mean it! Grade: A+
6303165680|5.0|&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; may not be the greatest movie in the history, but it surely is the best modern romantic comedy I ever saw.  The only film that can possibly surpass this delightful one is, perhaps, &quot;When Harry Met Sally ...&quot;  Maybe tied.<br />Hugh Grant has starred in many films since then, but his best role is still Charles of this film, who unwittingly finds his love in Carrie, an open-hearted American played by beautiful Andie MacDowell at his friend's wedding.  One miatake is, he foolishly couldn't realize it before he let her go after one-night stand.  But as the number of ceremony goes up (including one funeral), he gradually comes to notice that he threw away the best thing in his life.  And while he is wondering what to do, friends around him start to search for their real love, including his own brother David, his timid friend Tom, Tom's sister Fiona, and Charles's eccentric roommate Scarlet.  But where should Charles go?  Going back to his countless ex-girlfriends?  Or, Carrie?  But she got already married.  <br />To be honest, a little abrupt ending of the film damages an entire movie's strength a bit, but all comedies have to pay the price to end the show within an appointed hour.  What is incredibly splendid about &quot;Four Weddings&quot; is that the characters are all so lively and sparkling with witty dialogue that you think they are not acting at all.  Actually, on top of Hugh Grant, many actors are still associated with the roles in this film even if they got more populality after this film; Kristin Scott Thomas is later to be nominated Oscar for her turn in &quot;English Patient,&quot; but she will be remembered as deliciously aristocratic Fiona.  John Hannah made his name popular through the Hollywood blockbuster series of &quot;Mummy,&quot; but still he is kind-hearted Matthew to those who have seen him recite W H Auden (most touching moment) in &quot;Four Weddings.&quot;  This is that kind of film that changes the cast's life.  It happens once in your lifetime.<br />With this great ensemble cast, we have fantastic script by Richard Curtis, filled with funny lines uttered by completely  believable characters.  He does not fail to take great care of minor characters, and give them equally good moments.  Look how Serena, in love with handsome David who is hearing impaired, learns sign.  Trying to impress him, she mixes up &quot;nice&quot; with &quot;mice,&quot; but, you know, when boys and girls are in love. nothing can stop them from understanding each other.  Cute.<br />Brilliantly written, &quot;Four Weddings&quot; is a superb model of romantic comedy.  If you like this type of movie, you surely will fall in love with it; and if you're not, your mind will be changed just like mine (I didn't expected much from it, so I didn't go to theater until the last day).  And the film never forgets the sad side of life as the title implies.  Sad thing is one of the cast Charlotte Coleman, who played most unconventional bridesmaid Scarlett, has passed away recently.  She is terrific.
B00004XONN|4.0|In Radiohead's Kid A, I found it to be realy earie and on an emotional height, unlike alot of the music out there (Back Street Boys, Britney Spears, Nsync etc.)  In \\"How to Disapear Completly\\", the singer Thom Yorke takes the listener into a dream where one can find themself walking through walls and flying.  Most of the tracks on the CD are like this, with some kind of ambient soundscape that make you feel as if you were in a dream, in heaven, or just on acid.  I gave this 4 out of 5 stars for I wish it had more tracks, but it probably realy deserves 5.  So to sum it all up, if you want good music to drive, to do homework, to do art, and even to listen to while a sleep...BUY IT!  You won't regret it.
0471413909|3.0|This book has a lot of useful information, particularly on the effects of grains and excessive carbohydrates on the human body. When people replace animal foods and fats for grains, degeneration sets in as the fossil record shows.<br />Where the book goes wrong is in its explanation and role of fat in human diets. Cordain erroneously believes that saturated fats cause heart disease and other diseases--totally wrong. Because of this belief, he also writes that our Paleolithic ancestors did not each much saturated fat from animal sources. The evidence he gives to support this, however, is very selective and misleading.<br />For accurate information on saturated fats, see Uffe Ravnskov's excellent book THE CHOLESTEROL MYTHS, as well as Fallon and Enig's NOURISHING TRADITIONS.
B000003TAR|5.0|Thus starts \\"Dumb.\\" In a way, this one song represents perfectly not only Cobain, but the \\"outcast youth\\" he purportedly represented. It's not angry, narcissistic, ridiculously self-absorbed alienation (coughNineInchNailscough) - it's simply lonely, fragile and sad beyond belief. With its gentle cello and minor key, it is very well the most beautiful song the man ever wrote.<br />Oh yeah, there are eleven other songs here too. There's the wickedly acidic \\"Serve the Servants,\\" \\"Very Ape\\" and \\"Frances Farmer...\\". The humor is black and biting - \\"It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid.\\" Ouchie. There's also the exquisite \\"Heart Shaped Box,\\" a haunting portrayal of someone unable to stop loving even though he knows he's being used. There's \\"Pennyroyal Tea,\\" which marries the words \\"I'm a liar and a thief\\" to an anthemic chorus. There's the melancholy \\"All Apologies,\\" which now reads like a suicide note. There's \\"Rape Me,\\" which uses the old \\"Teen Spirit\\" riff but inverts it to almost frightening effect. And there are a bunch of throwaway, almost unlistenable tracks (\\"Scentless Apprentice,\\" \\"Milk It,\\" \\"tourette's\\") that are deliberately placed right in between the best parts for maximum irritation.<br />The album is filled with a very marked disgust for human flesh. One can see this in the anatomic references of \\"Milk It,\\" (\\"I own my own pet virus\\"? Yum.) the strange rants about perfumed skin in \\"Scentless Apprentice,\\" the frighteningly cryptic lines of \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter,\\" and of course, in the downright disturbing cover art. Cobain's lyrics are never very happy, ranging from sad to outright nihilistic, but he remains a musical genius and thus infuses the record with a multitude of hooks, which are so good that they aren't even negated by Albini's execrable production. In Utero is made a difficult record by its duality - loud screamfests go hand in hand here with some of the band's best melodies ever - but the brutal honesty withwhich Cobain examines himself and the sheer power of some of his lyrical imagery make it a masterpiece. And once again, \\"Dumb\\" is his best song ever, a song that at once shows why so much was made of this band and why it struck a chord with so many people. Rarely has there been a better band than Nirvana.
6303407188|5.0|I love this film like heck, great insight into the &quot;worst director of all times&quot;.<BR>Now when is this film ever going to reach DVD?
6305358567|2.0|This film is visually stunning.  The costuming is terrific, the camerawork excellent, the acting superb.  All of that would be the recipe for a superior film-if it wasn't touted as history.<br />I have watched this movie over and over just to catalogue all the points of history it gets wrong.  It's impossible to write them all in a review here; it would take a full monograph.  The acting is superb but the character portrayals couldn't be further from the truth.  <br />Jeffrey Rush plays Walshingham as the suave, debonair older man who is very fond of the queen.  The actual Walshingham was in fact very sophisticated and learned- otherwise he wouldn't have been a good ambassador in France- but he was also a Puritan who didn't approve of the Queen's behavior and was famous for his run-ins with her (during one of which she threw a shoe at him.)  He did run the most elaborate and sophisticated spy network of his day, but he was not a murderer.<br />David Attenboro looks very much the part of Lord Burghley (William Cecil) but doesn't act anything like the historical person.  Burghley, or William Cecil, was very careful not to criticize the queen's personal habits.  It was his circumspect behavior that kept him alive during the reigns of three Tudors, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth.  He was Elizabeth's principal secretary advisor was extremely influential in the decision-making of the queen.  This movie tries to make him look like the straight-laced, Puritan old man who is scandalized by the Queen's peccadillos.  As an illustration of how non-critical the man actually was, he never complained even as the Queen flirted with his son-in-law the Earl of Oxford and kept him away from his wife, Burghley's much-loved daughter, at the expense of her own happiness.<br />The Queen herself is portrayed by Cate Blanchett as a young girl whose nervousness is quite visible in most scenes.  The real Queen was very strong and very seldom displayed this kind of weakness.  In fact it is said she suffered from illnesses that modern experts say stemmed from the fact that she kept these feelings locked inside.<br />It would take too long to list all the errors and fabrications in this movie.  After reading 30+ books about the subject I still can't place some of the characters (who was the kid Walshingham (Jeffrey Rush) was supposed to have stabbed early on?)  I can say that some of the situations border on the supernatural (how does Mary of Guise become the matriarch of the house of Valois?  How does she survive so long after the War in Scotland?  Where's Mary Queen of Scots in all of this?)  To sum up, take this movie as entertainment; get your history elsewhere.
6305078564|4.0|Okay, I am a big fan of this movie and could rave on and on about it. I have watched it endlessly on my VHS tapes and thought the DVD version would be the answer to my prayers. I'd give this DVD version five stars if I could, but unfortunately the quality of the picture is flawed. Unlike other reviewers, I have no complaints about the colors or the color-contrast. My complaint is about the last three seconds of the final scene just before the credits on the first disc: the image turns grainy and mottled for those three seconds. In the final seconds on disc one, Darcy has just proposed marriage to Elizabeth Bennett, been rejected, and left the room in a huff. Now, a close up on Elizabeth's face registering shock and anger, but this all-important close-up of our heroine's face in a most important scene is marred by sudden graininess and mottling!...

6303201962|2.0|What a disappointment! I like the first Star Trek series, so I was favorably disposed to like this film.  Nonetheless, this movie is too self-conscious and cutesy, exaggerating all of the characters' traits to the point of caricature. (Scotty even plays the bagpipes in one scene -- after all, he's Scottish!) The dialog is stiff and unconvincing when it tries to recreate the magic of the old crew being together by having the predictable fight between Bones and Spock, the predictable medical advice by Bones to Kirk, etc. Even worse, one almost feels sorry for the actors when they have to deliver such lines such as, \\"There's an old Klingon saying that....\\" or \\"Mmmm, is that Romulan wine?\\" all the while wearing their absurd-looking costumes. (The TV series' costumes look better than the film's late 70s / early 80s \\"space age\\" sensibility.)<br />William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban compete for the \\"campiest performance of the year\\" Oscar. The acting of most of the rest of the old Star Trek crew is so bad that you can see why they never could establish acting careers outside of the Star Trek franchise. Checkov's entranced episodes are particularly laughable. About the only crew member who makes it out with his dignity intact is Leonard Nimoy.<br />Speaking of Spock, the film can't even come by its pathos honestly. After trying to wring emotion out of his \\"death\\" in this movie, he ends up returning alive in subsequent films.<br />The plot is rather unsuspenseful and uninteresting, without any swashbuckling pizzaz. It's no wonder that one person watching the film with me fell asleep.<br />At a technical level, the film is merely competent, with average special effects for the time and uninspired cinemaphotography. The musical score unsuccessfully reaches for grandeur.<br />My advice is to skip this film and watch a rerun of the classic original television series.
0790751089|5.0|The book brought me to tears and I hoped that the film would do the same, and it did. It made me cry so much, no other fim has moved me so much, it is truly beautiful and romantic. Meryl streep and clint eastwood make you believe so much in that chance meeting and I don't honestly believe there is another fim like it, it is a masterpeice and I recomend it to anyone because I haven't met a person yet who hasn't cried while watchimg this film.
B000002KAT|2.0|I've been a Van Morrison fan since his days with Them, and think I have heard everything he has recorded, so I feel qualified to offer an educated opinion of Astral Weeks.<BR>For years I have been reading all the critical claptrap about how Astral Weeks is one of the seminal albums of the 60's, how it is far and away the best album Van has ever recorded, and how it belongs in every serious music fan's collection. Such nonsense! Advanced for its day it may have been, but the music now seems tired and dated.<BR>I own Astral Weeks and I do listen occasionally, but it is not anywhere near his best. On this CD as on a few others, Van tends to maunder on endlessly making much of the album a colossal bore. For stream-of-consciousness singing, the later Veedon Fleece is far superior.<BR>Astral Weeks is one of those albums that has received so many critical hosannas from the &quot;experts&quot; that it seems many shrink from criticizing its lack of depth and direction for fear of being accused of not &quot;getting it&quot;. It is also one of those albums every Van Morrison fan has heard of, but also one which few of them have actually listened to. I've had people tell me what a great album it is yet not be able to tell me anything about it except that &quot;everybody says&quot; it is one of the best.<BR>Its time to desanctify Astral Weeks. Its not a terrible album, but Van Morrison has issued at least 20 better.<BR>If you are a fan who prefers Van Morrison's bluesier, jazzier albums to the mystical meanderings of Veedon Fleece, Common One, or No Guru, No Method, No Teacher then maybe you should try to listen to this first before buying.
0784010501|5.0|The ultimate dare is to tell the truth. That's exactly what Madonna dared to do when she signed new director Alek Kishian to follow her and her crew around the world on her 1990 Blonde Ambition Tour. You get to see everything, because basically Madonna had nothing to hide. The viewer gets to see Madonna mouth off with her technical crew, a visit to the throat doctor, her fights with then boyfriend Warren Beatty, how she almost got arrested for a stimulated masturbation scene on-stage for her hit \\"Like A Virgin,\\" and just hanging out with her friends. This film shows everything. Being a Madonna fan, I loved this movie. Not just because it was about Madonna, but because it was bold, daring, and original considering it was released in 1991. I've never seen a movie like this, and being a movie nut, I liked it because it was different. Every scene is interesting. The film is serious, touching, and at times comical. My favorite part was when Madonna was in bed with her dancers and her backup singers Nicki Harris and Donna Delory. This is a very comical scene...<BR>Along with this great movie you get to see a few numbers from the Blonde Ambition Tour. Full numbers include: \\"Express Yourself,\\" \\"Like A Virgin,\\" \\"Vogue,\\" and \\"Keep It Together.\\" Snippets include: \\"Oh Father,\\" \\"Live To Tell,\\" \\"Like A Prayer,\\" and \\"Causing A Commotion.\\" Overall, this is an awesome movie. Every Madonna fan should see this. Even non fans will enjoy. Movie buffs especially will love this!...

B00003CXXI|5.0|THis has to be the funniest movie since, since ever!<BR> It will appeal to kids from the age of three to adults as old as they can get. The characters are original and side splittingly funny. Sure to bring the whole family together with its wit, charm and high morals. The characters range from a sarcastic but soft hearted ogre (mIke myers) to a beuatiful yet streetwise princess (Cmaron Diaz) and a charming, loyal and jjust down right funny, talking donkey (Ediie Murphy). I hope none of you have any doubts whatsoever about buying it!
B000021Y74|5.0|This is clearly one of the most creative films I have ever seen. It was a huge hit at the 1998 Toronto Film Festival and at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival and well deserves every award it won. In German, with English subtitles, this is a wild and exciting fast-paced movie that cannot be neatly assigned to a type or genre. Starring Franka Potente as Lola, her unique screen presence defined by her strong body, engaging tattoos and raggedy orange hair, she has a mere 20 minutes to get a large amount of money to her boyfriend so that he won't be killed by the mob. Instead of just showing us one of Lola's approaches, the film gives us three choices, and packs a strong punch with its theme of fate and destiny and how one tiny little move can effect not only the main characters, but also everyone around them. You can literally pick your own ending, each one packed with excitement and ironies.<br />Most of the film shows Lola running, and as she passes by the same bystanders, their lives are changed in long-ranging ways. The pace of this movie is fast and is a mere 81 minutes long and it didn't lag for one single moment. As a matter of fact, I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen because I didn't want to miss anything. The soundtrack is perfect to accompany all the running, and the director, Tom Tykwer, uses a great mix of animation, still photography, slow motion and some very unusual camera shots. Never, once, however did the film sink into just a palette for showing off his artistry. The story and the characters were foremost and the audience is held captive, their hearts beating, as they join Lola in her run. Recommended. Don't miss it!

B000055ZB8|3.0|The other descriptions provide very good explanations of the advantages of this DVD.  The one big flaw is that the included musical scores ruined the suspense of the film.  The newer symphony recording seemed goofy, the organ score was more acceptable but for some reason soothed the creepiest scenes.  <br />There was a version I saw on VHS several years ago (probably expurgated more than this one) that had a sparse and unsettling soundtrack that fit the movie perfectly. It wasn't well recorded, but that only made it fit all the better.  Wish I knew which version that was...
B00005J9M3|5.0|I bought this CD when it came out in 1991 on the way to a trip to Key West.  I fell in love on that trip, listened to the CD endlessly, and still LOVE it after 10+ years.  This is one of CD's that I listen to on a regular basis.   It's fantastic.
0553293397|5.0|The Naked Sun is the sequel to The Caves of Steel, and like that is a detective story set on the featuring robot-hating Plainclothesman Baley and, as if to prove Asimov really could predict the future, or movie-making of the '80s anyway, his entirely unsuited partner R Daneel Olivaw, a robot. Unlike CoS it's set on the (spacer) planet Solaria, a planet of few people and many, servile, robots.<br />I was a little disappointed after reading CoS, and was expecting something of the sort here, but that didn't happen. CoS was set on an Earth which I found awkwardly described - you got the impression Asimov was trying to say things about the way people thought but couldn't quite get them out. No such problem with The Naked Sun, where Baley's future-Earth foibles are out in the open (figuratively and literally), and Asimov also successfully hints for the first time that a utopia made up of a world where everything is done for you and where people can live for hundreds of years may, possibly, be flawed, a thesis that becomes stronger in &quot;Robots of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Robots and Empire.&quot;<br />Asimov wrote that CoS was an attempt to answer a critic that it was impossible to combine the genres of science fiction with detective stories. The Naked Sun is much more than an answer to that challenge, it's one of Asimov's earliest studies of humanity, and it's a well written thoroughly readable one at that.

B000007S5B|4.0|This album is a match for Strange Days, and arguably more consistent. There are no gigantic poetry recitations as the band concentrates on their skill of writing short and structured songs. In my opinion, I always felt the short songs were the Doors finest. Each one of their first six albums have around five obscure songs that clock around or under three minutes with very creative arrangements, chord selection, and lyrics. This is the reason I recommended for collectors to buy these six albums, as opposed to best-of collections. This album also is a transformation from the first two because of some experimentation, and the general abandonment of dark themes. The album's hits were Hello I Love You(#1), and The Unknown Solider(#39).  The former was very commercial, and if it was performed without fuzz, and sung in a higher voice, it would be an Ohio Express styled bubblegum song. The previous comment was not meant to call the Doors &quot;bubblegum,&quot; it was simply to show that the Doors had a good ear for what could be a hit single. One could argue that The Unknown Solider was pretentious, but this writer feels it was one of the best arranged and most touching war protest songs of the era. The well organized short recordings on this release besides the hits were tracks 2,4,5,7,9 and 10. They include depressing and effective ballads such as the perennial Summer's Almost Gone, and the drowning Yes, the River Knows, as well as one of the bands most psychedelic cuts, Spanish Caravan, which made good use of stereo separation. Caravan also had flamenco guitar adroitly played by Krieger, adding to the experimental side of the album. This leaves three more cuts. My Wild Love was something of a throwaway tune simply being a chant with percussion. Not to Touch the Earth was successful, being a ridiculous yet very intense outburst with some raging nonsensical lyrics, and strong hard rock backing by the musicians, ending with what was probably Morrison's most famous quote. Five to One was another very intense song, with some fine blues guitar played by Krieger, and a very solid performance by Morrison reminiscent of his vocals on Back Door Man. The song's blueprint was a simplistic yet catchy guitar riff that could be taught to anyone in less than five minutes. Being one of the Doors first six albums, this is recommended to collectors.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This is a revision of my original review in which I gave this disk 4 stars. There were some items advertised as being on the disk which I couldn't find. At least one of those items has been found, it was obscured by an odd technical problem with my DVD player (Creative for PC). I still can't find the Cameron-with-Mom interview, but I have to assume it is there... <br />There may be nothing wrong with this disk after all and the movie is superb. If the subject matter is of interest to you, this is a must have. But, you probably already know that by now.

B00005RFVL|5.0|You know how sometimes in a dream you find and purchase something so strange and delightful it could only exist in a dream -- and waking up without it is just so sad.  Well, apparently I made it out of dreamland with this one.  It's a remarkable piece of work -- maybe Robbie doesn't have the Voice, but he does have the Phrasing.  (Frank fans will know what I mean.)  While the duets have gotten a lot of attention, it's the solo numbers that really astound me.  Cheesy as it sounds, this &quot;One For My Baby&quot; made me cry; it was Sinatra's magnum opus, and Robert Peter does it justice and then some -- very much then some.  This record is confoundingly perfect.  You're aces, Robbie.
B00005RFAI|1.0|On November 20, 2001, Pink released  her sophomore effort, \\"Missundaztood.\\"  In this hip-hoppish  release, Pink tells us about her past and what it was like growing up with her parents splitting up.  Unlike her first release, \\"Cant Take Me Home\\" (2000), she uses more explicit material than in her debut.  It did disgust me in the booklet when it looked like she was having sex with a stuffed bear.  <br /> So let's take a minute to go over the tracks. <br /> In the title track, she tells us how we misunderstand her because she talks about sex when she is talking about just love.  <br /> In \\"Don't Let Me Get Me,\\" she wants to be someone else instead of a pop star.  She says she is not pop.  I admire her for that.<br /> In the first explicit song \\"Just Like A Pill,\\" she swears to try to be more of not a teeny bopper.  Its about how she took drugs and thought it would be fun (nice influence for kids).  She didn't like her boyfriend and she is comparing him to a pill because he is making her sick.<br /> And now it's the first single to the album, \\"Get The Party Started.\\"  I think this is one of the reasons why this album is called \\"Missundaztood\\" because it sounds like she is about to admit she is gay and she wants a party for it.<br /> In the speak out song, kind of rap song \\"Respect\\" (NO its not an Aretha Franklin remake), she talks about how she doesn't take [disrespect] from boys and she says that respect isn't easy and ladies don't come for free.  She even says its her rap song.<br /> The edited \\"18 Wheeler\\" has [profanity] in some of it and she tries to be \\"unbeatable\\" and she tells beautiful ladies to not let a guy boss her around.<br /> Now we move to the ballad part of the album where she is talking about when her parents got separated (\\"Family Portrait\\" its kinda like Everclear`s wonderful.)  and how she is alone and people disagree with her because she's rich and she has a lot (\\"Lonley Girl\\").  In one song she writes in her diary and she talks about how she hasdone bad stuff and that shes famous.  In songs like \\"Eventually,\\" \\"Numb,\\" and \\"Eventually\\" she talks about being famous, a role model and weak from her boyfriend.  Not even the duet with Stephen Tyler (\\"Misery\\") could impress me to listen to this. <br /> I didn't really like this album (TOO MANY METAPHORS).  But if you are a fan of Pink, and you are over 12, this is for you.  Even in the thank-yous she used a couple f-bombs.<br />   <BR>                             -Greg Pattak
B00003CXBK|3.0|This is, indeed, a beautiful production; real eye-candy.<br />I had no difficulties with the voices -- i particularly liked Billy Bob Thornton, who caught just the nuance with his characterisation that Jack Elam at his most comically villainous brings to live-action films.<br />The story isn't all that complex, but the characters and their relationships *are*.<br />Is the hunter, who wants the head of the Forest Spirit to win a fabulous reward that the Emperor has promised, an evil man?  Certainly, many of his actions are what one might call evil or lead to evil, but i'm sure he doesn't think of himself as anything but a business man.<br />Is the Lady of Irontown, who wants to kill the Forest Gods (demiurges incarnate as huge talking animals) and destroy the forest, so that she can mine ore more easily, evil?  Certainly, evil will come of *that* plan -- but the community she wants the ore to support consists in large part of girls she has rescued from brothels and lepers whom no-one else will take in, whom she has not only taken in but made respected and respectable members of society, which certainly indicates she is something other than evil incarnate.<br />Are the Forest Gods themselves, turning fang and claw and tusk against humanity, battling in blind fury when nothing else seems possible, evil?  Hardly.  But they are representative of a way that *must* pass with the coming of humanity, and hard as it seems, their time is over.<br />Is \\"the system\\" evil? Is human civilisation, in and of itself, evil?<br />Is it possible to reduce the whole issue, as Buffy does at one point on TV as \\"Fire bad -- Tree pretty\\", saying that wildness and trees take precedence over human progress and expansion?<br />Or, conversely, to assert that, *of course* humanity's needs take precedence over those of nature and wilderness?<br />The answer -- to either of the last two questions -- of course, is \\"No, it isn't.\\"  Everything must proceed by compromise, in balance, or we and the world we live in will go down to disaster.<br />The earlier parts of this film look as if it may turn out to be a pure tree-hugger's \\"ecology\\" spiel, but by the end, it is obvious that the survivors (on both human and forest sides) have taken the lessons of their adventures to heart, and are probably going to manage to come to some sort of modus vivendi that will enable both to exist and to interfere only minimally with each other.<br />Would the real world could learn such lessons.<br />((BTW -- i didn't read the subtitles, i listened to the English-dubbed version [which is excellent in terms of sound quality and voice selection], and i didn't notice anyone being referred to as \\"Princess Mononoke\\" or any variant thereupon.  Is the title a descriptive phrase that merely *sounds* like a character name == \\"Princess of the Wolves\\", or some such -- or werenames changed for the dubbed version?))d we live in will go down to disaster.<br />The earlier parts of this film look as if it may turn out to be a pure tree-hugger's \\"ecology\\" spiel, but by the end, it is obvious that the survivors (on both human and forest sides) have taken the lessons of their adventures to heart, and are probably going to manage to come to some sort of modus vivendi that will enable both to exist and to interfere only minimally with each other.<br />Would the real world could learn such lessons.<br />((BTW -- i didn't read the subtitles, i listened to the English-dubbed version [which is excellent in terms of sound quality and voice selection], and i didn't notice anyone being referred to as \\"Princess Mononoke\\" or any variant thereupon.

B00005QIPH|5.0|I recently watched the Strokes on SNL so I decided to get this cd considering I found their sound to be quite different from most of what is out there right now.  I mostly buy alot of cds from older artists so I hadn't really heard any of the hype about this band until after I bought the cd.  I was pleasantly surprised that I liked all the songs on this one and once I had listened to it the first time I relistened to it again.  Now it has become a cd I play quite often.<br />Yes, they are a throwback to the sixties and seventies.  Being a Velvet Underground and Stooges fan, I found this to be a pleasant reminder of that musical era.  Of course, its truly impossible to be completely original these days but I'm glad that this band is doing something very different in this dull and musically uninspired time.<br />Can the Strokes save rock?  I think they are doing their fair share to bring it back.  Its funny because the first time I heard Limp Bizkit's &quot;Nookie&quot; I wondered what had happened to rock and roll.  When I heard the songs on this one, I felt hope that music might possibly be redeemed.  These guys make great music.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is a movie that you realy want to watch it over and over again, you discover a new thing each time,for example why didnt the birds fly while the girl was running into them on the green fields as john saw her, and why the people were looking at him in a strange way while he was talking to his friends.<br />It is said that the movie isnt the true match of john nash life accordding to the book or to the biaography, regardless if we took the movie alone, its a classic, a movie that tells a story of a man who was pushed by his ambitions and detirmination to cross the lines and to exceed the limit.<br />Iam NOT a director,a film maker, or a critic..am only an ordinary person who watched the film and after that i started thinking about it... after all isnt that the whole idea of watching a movie, to leave with an impression about what you watched, to force your mind to think and review what you have been setting and watching for two hours.<br /> - After you watched the movie,Did you think about the original idea you want in your life,Did you realy changed the definition of the word sruggel and success, Are you willing to take your self beyaound limits for what you belive in.<br /> -  directing,actting the sound track it was so great and almost perfect , but for russel crow i think he was extraordinary,and try not to comapre the movie with the book, that isnt fair for the movie nor to the book, the movie is only two hours, YOU CANT TELL A ONE MAN LIFE IN TWO HOURS,INSTED ITS WHAT YOU CAN TELL IN THOSE TWO HOURS?<br /> In John Nash life, those two hours were about about ambition,deternmination,vision,strugle,love,hope and finaly..success.<br /> If we tried to take a moment..just one moment..and think...Think with the whole picture in our minds, we can see that the true plot of the movie<BR>is orientied on that \\"Original Idea\\"..the effort of a man to come up with a true original idea, his seek and effort forced him to exceeds the limits, and keep in mind that what you watched was a true story.<BR> <BR> A Beatufuil mind is a true \\"Original Movie\\", which does its job by leaving you wondering and asking questions.<br /> I think its also a great movie becuase its the kind that youll watch it again and again, it leaves an impression and leaving an impression is somthing rare in these days movies.

0767802659|2.0|This movie bored me pretty quickly.  The fighting scenes were a little drawn out, & too fake-gory to take too seriously.  Not to mention some actors (AHEM, denise richards) need some acting lessons.  It's got something for everyone I guess.  Special effects I suppose would be the only saving grace, cuz the story line is pretty boring & predictable.  Good looking cast for members of the opposite sex to both drool over (if you like the totally fake pretty ditsy types anyway), & at least Casper Van Dien's character did it some justice.  I got most frustrated in some scenes where some of the characters should've died a LONG time ago, yet somehow nothing happens to them (ahem, denise richards).  Ya, so movies aren't supposed to be realistic, but c'mon!!  Worth watching for the fighting scenes, but everything in between, you're not missing much by doing something else.
0800141865|5.0|One of the best films ever made on the personal right of free speech and civil liberties. If you are a supporter of our first amendment rights this is a must see film. You may not like the people portrayed in this film or what they have to say, but they do have a right to say it.  If you don't like it don't listen and don't watch. They may offend you. Great performances by Woody Harrelson (way over-the-top) and Edward Norton (very tolerant) are an asset.
B00003CXAW|5.0|...and isn't that event just as rare as a hen's tooth, kids? <br />King Kong is the stick by which ll monster movies are measured. With its classic story (boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy dies because ofgirl. That's Romeo & Juliet, too, you know.) and high adventure, King Kong lets you relive those old matinee days of heroes and damsels in distress--with the welcome twist. <br />King Kong is a pivotal, must see film for any movie buff, but any sci fi or adventure fan has to be well versed in it as well. There are many imitators, but only one 8th Wonder of the World!<br />King Kong is a must for any movie fan's library.

630575067X|3.0|I saw Phantom Menace before I saw the Trilogy, and I have to admit that when I first saw it, I was impressed.  However, afterwards, I decided that it was not as good as the Trilogy, by a longshot.  <br />I give it three stars, first of all, for the dazzling computer generation, especially the adrenaline-filled Podrace, the terrible droid battle with the Gungans and the underwater race with the giant fish.  I still marvel at what computers can do today.<br />Secondly, for Liam Neeson's part in general.  He did the part of the wise and kindly Jedi master Qui-gon Jinn, whose apprentice was Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and who sensed the power behind innocent Anakin Skywalker's (Jake Lloyd) appearance.  I liked his part and was sorry and sad [with what happens to him].  Natalie Portman also played the part of beautiful Queen Amidala.<br />Thirdly, for the music, being a fan of John Williams' first soundtrack for the Trilogy, I purchased the soundtrack for this one.  It was remarkably better than the movie.  Anyway, if I don't stop, I'll go rambling on about the soundtrack.  If you like Trilogy, see this and maybe you'll like it too...maybe not.
0446604844|4.0|This was my first David Baldacci book and not the usual genre of books I read, but I found it to be a face-paced, exciting tale of industrial espionage and counter-espionage.  The many characters and numerous plots twists and turns keep the reader engrossed throughout the almost 700 pages.  Written in 1997, the computer and internet technology described may have been somewhat complicated then, but today in 2002, is very easy to read and comprehend.  My one criticism is that, like many other authors today, Baldacci appeared to be writing this novel with a screenplay already in mind.  Yes, it would make a great movie - but I think he was making that assumption just a tad too early.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Director George Lucas certainly new what he was doing when he made these movies, unlike with Phantom Menace.  I liked A New Hope best, Return of Jedi second, and Empire Strikes Back least.  I give it five stars for the following reasons:<br />1.  The first star is for the superb acting of Harrison Ford as the braggish space pilot Han Solo.  He did a great job!  Also, James Earl Jones' deep voice was excellent for the evil Darth  Vader.  Carrie Fisher was ok as Princess Leia and Mark Hamill did will in the first two, though he was kinda weird as a Jedi in the last.  Other voices include Alec Guinnes as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anthony Daniels as c-3PO.<br />2.  The second star is for the magnificent special effects, especially during the destruction of the first Death Star and the lightsaber duels.  This 1997 edition also include some specially done computer-generation for a new scene with Jabba the Hutt and some interesting new creatures in his palace.<br />3.  The third star is for the droid duo in itself.  The arguments and antics of C-3PO and R2-d2 are just so hilarious anf the way Han snaps at Threepio all the time and calls him \\"Goldenrod!\\"<br />4.  The fourth star is for the music.  John Williams is my favorite American composer.  His music in the SWT was strong, powerful and at times, sad.  I intend to buy the Trilogy's soundtracks as soon as possible and any other Williams soundtracks too.  Any recommendations would be helpful?<br />5.  The fifth star is for thr story and the plot, which is rather simply when you come down to.  A farmboy, longing to leave his dusty planet, journies to become a Jedi knight and discovers that an evil Imperial leader is his father.  A young Princess and a small band of Rebels fight against a consuming force threatening the galaxy.  And in the meantime, the Empire is building a strong, planet-destroying machine.<br />These are great films, and though the theology is a little rusty and the movies are not for little kids (violent and scary), I highly recommend them to any sci-fi lovers.
B00005JKQX|5.0|John Forbes Nash is a brilliant mathematician. He won The Nobel Prize in 1994. And he also suffers from Schizophrenia. <br />  A Beautiful Mind tells his story, from College to the present. I have never seen Mental Illness so realistically depicted in any medium, be it film or prose. I won't say anything about the film itself; there are some AMAZING surprises along the way, and anything I might say would only ruin them. I'll just praise Director Ron Howard, Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, and stars Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, & Ed Harris. They are all outstanding, with Crowe in particular being Oscar-worthy for his portrayal of the tortured Nash.<br />  Upon leaving the Theater, I was thinking that A Beautiful Mind was one of the best pictures that I have ever seen. Very Impressive, indeed!
0064407667|4.0|The whole series is cute and well written, but that's not surprising if you know who Lemony Snicket is.  Lemony Snicket is an unpublicized alias for J.K. Rowling.  That's very true.
0790729628|3.0|I saw Blade Runner on TV when I was younger, but I have never seen it uncut and commercial-free, and I've never seen The Director's Cut, so it was with GREAT enthusiasm that I purchased the DVD.....<br />  Yawn.<br />  The story of a cop being pressed back into duty as a \\"Blade-Runner\\", a hunter/killer of sentient rogue androids, is very promising, but Director Ridley Scott, while delivering a great LOOKING movie, gives the viewer nothing else to latch onto. The characters are all cold, one-dimensional pawns being put through their paces; I didn't care about any of them at all. Harrison Ford seems to sleepwalk through his role. The replicants themselves didn't seem too menacing; If they're so dangerous,why not send a few more Blade Runners after them, so they can be dealt with that much quicker? Why is Edward James Olmos' character being paid to stand around and do nothing???? Get to killing some replicants, pal! <br /> The DVD has NOTHING in the way of extras, just some...\\"Production Notes\\", that are really nothing more than Cast Bios. This movie screams out for a Ridley Scott commentary track. And the much-ballyhooed \\"Unicorn Vision\\", that is supposed to reveal whether or not Deckard is a replicant himself, is all of two seconds long, and told me nothing new. The climactic battle between Deckard and Roy Batty is exciting and beautiful to look at, but that's about it. I had no emotional stake in the outcome of the fight, or the film itself for that matter. This DVD is obviously older than dirt, so hopefully the studio will issue a new version, with some commentary tracks and extras that will shed some light on the more puzzling aspects of the story. In the meantime, I have purchased the BFI Modern Classics Blade Runner book, and I'll be looking for answers there.
B00005OCMR|3.0|Well, I hate to admit it, but it finally happened. I thought I was vigilant enough to prevent it from ever happening to me, but now I'm yet another victim. A victim of what, you ask? A victim of a movie studio's DVD double-dip sales strategy, that's what! I'm sure most of you digital videophiles are familiar with the scene: one of your fave flicks comes out on DVD with minimal extra features, and you buy it, never suspecting that the studio and/or distributor might put out a deluxe, mega-tricked-out collector's edition DVD of the same beloved movie sometime down the road. But sure enough, several months to a few years later, that's exactly what happens. Fortunately, I learned of Disney's double-dip tactic with TRON about four months before the 20th Anniversary edition's street date, so I was able to auction off my old platter of it on eBay before word-of-mouth (and of e-mail) spread about the new release. Fortunately, I recouped almost all of what I originally paid for it. If I'd put it on the block any later, I likely wouldn't've gotten as much for it, and... hey wait a minute, I'm going off on a tangent here. I'm giving you advice for selling your DVDs on eBay when I should be presenting my review of the item at hand. Sorry `bout that. I'm gonna get back on track here with my critiques of this particular DVD edition's special features, starting....<br />...right now. I think I'm getting a bit jaded with the bonus materials included with these special-edition DVDs. There was a time when I'd be almost ecstatic over the extra thingies that I'd be able to look at and enjoy long after the closing credits of the movie itself were rolling. But nowadays, it just doesn't seem as big a deal anymore. It's probably because just about every Collector's version movie platter contains pretty much the same things: one or more behind-the-scenes documentaries and/or featurettes, stills of the movie in production as well as various merchandise & promotional items, deleted/altered scenes, storyboard sketches, and of course the obligatory trailers and teasers. All of which can be found in this particular presentation, as well as a few other bits & pieces Disney picked up off the cutting-room floor. Oh yes, and let's not forget...<br />...the feature-length commentary track. TRON'S secondary audio channel is helmed by co-writer/director Stephen Lisberger and a few other TRON collaborators. Often they'll go over the making of each corresponding scene, as well as the movie's history of production. Throw in a few cute little anecdotes, and you pretty much have your basic informative commentary track. A few of the things the speakers mention here are also discussed in the behind-the-scenes documentary, so you might already be familiar with some of the things they're commenting on if you watched the doc beforehand.<br />Unfortunately, I have to concur with a few of my fellow Amazonians about the TRON 20th Anniversary DVD's picture quality. The movie isn't quite as crisp & clear as the preceding bare-bones edition disc. I found the sound quality & separation to be as good, though. I really enjoy hearing the subtle background sounds that I never even noticed until I saw it on DVD. A great example of this are the famous Pac-Man video game sound effects that one can hear during the scenes on the bridge of Sark's giant CGI carrier/cruiser thingy.<br />Well, I guess it's time for me to wind this up. If you already own this flick, I'm going to leave you with a little \\"Where's Waldo?\\"-type task: look for Mickey Mouse's head, which is drawn somewhere on the landscape of the CGI realm in the last half of the movie. Oh, and no fair listening to the commentary track (Lisberger & friends point it out)!<br />`Late
B000002B7O|5.0|I have to agree with what other reviewers have said, this album is not just Ozzy's best, it one of the all-time greats in rock history.<br />\\"Flying High Again\\" is a classic tune, and Ozzy inundates the rest of the album with strong, powerful vocals.  Randy Rhoads rises to meet him with his amazing, tremendously influential guitar.  Sadly, this would be Randy's final album before his tragic death.<br />Another notable aspect of this album is its eerie mood; it is the first time Ozzy has truly addressed and expressed his bouts with manic depression, which are aptly summarized in the hauntingly eerie title song.<br />A perfect five star rating; again one of the all-time great rock albums.
0385335482|5.0|I really loved &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; by Sophie Kinsella.  I thought it was a sweet and charming tale of &quot;overdrafts&quot; and &quot;clearance sales.&quot;  Rebecca Bloomwood could be any 20-something with an obsession for shopping.  She is your average girl with average problems, like rent - men - and an obsession with shoes.  While this isn't a tough read, it's fun and flirty.  I liked to slow romance between Rebecca and Ben... and was more than happy to follow them along their road.  I stayed up pretty late reading this one and was more than happy to do it.
B000002B7U|4.0|Ignore all the critics who said this album was overcommercialized glam-rock, because it is NOT. Just because MTV finally recognized Ozzy's musical genius does not make him a sellout.<br />This album can be ranked among Ozzy's best, with Jake Lee in peak form on lead guitar. Ozzy's signature metaphorical lyrics resonate throughout, especially on such classic tunes as \\"Shot in the Dark\\" and the title track. As with the previous two albums, he sets aside a song to address his battle with manic depression, this time it is \\"Secret Loser\\". His satirical side comes out on \\"Thank God for the Bomb\\", and the remainder of the album offers the traditional hard rocking ballads for which the Blizzard is known.
0679735909|5.0|How does one even began to write a halfway objective review of a book with which one has, quite literally, fallen in love?  I guess by accepting one of the underlying themes of the novel: that the world we live and love in is a mysterious place and that for all the verbal magic of which we humans are capable (as evinced in this novel!) we fall short of being able to pin down Reality.  As Randolph Ash, one of the two Victorian era characters puts it on page 306, &quot;He thought of his hopes and expectations and the absence of language for most of them.&quot;<br />  What I find more than a tad disconcerting about almost all the other reviews (with a few greatly appreciated exceptions!) is that the readers want plot, characters, and page-turning reading.-That is, they want diversion and entertainment-Thus they are none-too-suprisingly less than filled with rapture over a book whose fundamental theme, it seems to me, is the nature of the love and language that makes us conscious, sentient human beings.<br />  Yes, there is a plot.  But the 20th century characters seem so thin, two-dimensional and untextured in comparison to the Nineteenth century artists on whom they are fixated that this hardly seems to be what this book is all about.  What it IS about is the love between Ash and LaMotte and the nature of love in general.  The tenuity of the 20th century characters and their relationships seems to be purposeful in order to contrast them with their Nineteenth Century subjects.<br />  &quot;...the life of the past persisting in us, is the business of every thinking man and woman.&quot;  This is a quote by Ash, in the Nineteenth Century.  The only two twentieth century characters who truly make internalizing the past their business are obviously Roland and Maud.<br />  OK. I won't go on to a long dissertation.  But I will say that I was amazed that none of the editorial or customer reviews (I read ALL of them) so much as mentioned Proust, the themes of whose work this work most closely parallels.  And I will also say to those few reviewers who seemed to appreciate the deeper implications of this novel, to give Proust a gander.  I will also state that for me that the gauntlet the book throws down for the reader is proffered by Ash on p.185 &quot;-the only life I am sure of is the life of the imagination.&quot;<br />  But you have to have been enchanted by the magical realm the characters have let flow from their souls into their poetry and letters, filling half or more of the book (which so many of the reviewers admit to have skipped) to appreciate the mystery with which Byatt confronts us:  What, after all, is REAL?  Is the brief physical relationship between Ash and LaMotte more REAL than their poetry and visionary experiences which fill these pages?<br />  It seems to me you have to have at least asked yourself these questions to understand the choice Roland makes at the end.<br />  To conclude, this book is for those who are truly Romantic and possess a sense of wonder at themselves and the constantly changing universe they inhabit and who ask themselves from time to time &quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot;Where am I?&quot; &quot;What is Love?&quot;  To those readers who have that sense of wonder and in whom this novel struck a resounding chord, I recommend Proust as a follow-up.  Yes, his Remembrance of Things Past is 3,000 pages long.  But you don't have to read all of it at one sitting!most closely parallels.

B000002B7S|5.0|This album almost eclipses DIARY OF A MADMAN as Ozzy's best.  Jake Lee had a daunting challenge to step into the late Randy Rhoads' shoes, and while not quite Randy, he filled the slot pretty damn well.<br />The album starts off with a bang with the classic title track, then maintains its momentum with the meaningful, and poignant &quot;You're No Different&quot;.  It continues with such anthems as &quot;Rock N Roll Rebel&quot;.  &quot;Waiting for Darkness&quot; further addresses Ozzy's bouts with depression that he covered on the MADMAN album.  Keyboards are also introduced (a welcome introduction) on this album, most prominently on &quot;So Tired&quot;, which ranks among the album's best listens.<br />This album is obviously one that is more near and dear to Ozzy, due to the heartfelt lyrics on most of the songs.<br />Five stars.

B00005N9CV|4.0|Guess I had too much time on my hands but I have heard the album and read a lot of the reviews.  Jazz purists....wake up! Yea, I can throw names around too as I use to be a DJ and played many traditional 'jazz' artists (my favorite was Horne - not Shirley but Lena).  But Krall's keyboard work and sultry voice are opening up this form of music to a whole new group of people.  Is she classical jazz?  Absolutely not.  But what is really classical jazz?  Depends on who you talk to.  For me, I just play music I like to drive to and Krall fits the jazz bill just fine.  Of couse, not being a jazz purist, I could just as easily play one of my other CD's which includes the likes of Jimmi Hendrix, Frank Sinatra, Beatles, Glenn Miller and the Army Air Force Band (still the best big band ever), Elvis, Ella Fitzgerald, Linda Ronstadt (remember Lush Life?), George Strait, Carlos Santana, Henry Mancini, Cream (early Clapton) or any of my classical CD's (I like Mozart and Ravel). So jazz purists, get a life and let the rest of us enjoy some great music from Ms. Krall.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Finding the perfect comparison band or even the best analogy to describe this CD is ridiculous.  Television?!  Please, how ludicrous would it be to imitate that?  The Strokes may not be innovators and Julian Casablancas (whose dad owns a modeling agency) is an okay singer but nothing fantastic.  Even so, these guys are getting the job done and they really do seem to be having fun.  Let's face it.  Between the robotic teen singers whose backbeats are as droning as the cash registers totalling their receipts to the suburban pseudo-punk that all the kids are groovin' to, there's not much real entertainment out there for people who have actually owned LP's out of necessity.  <br />The Strokes have put together a few really nice tunes for the soundtrack to our daily lives.  That's something.  So, who cares who did it first?  They're bratty NYC kids with connections and some musical chops.  That is it.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|Funny at times, new ideas incorporated into fantasy animation, but still not much here. Great for kids but not much replay or worth on an adult level. Its good but not great ! A good watch once, but thats it.<br />OO Agent
B00005RIKD|3.0|After reading the all the reviews about this CD I came to a conclusion. If you like Sting in the late 90's or are a die-hard fan this is a five star CD. But if you have gotten bored with Stings facination with jazz and slowing all his songs down to a yawn you will hate this CD. I happened to get the japan version which has 18<BR>tracks instead of 15. Bonus tracks are Seven Days, Mad About You and Shape of My Heart.<BR>Like it or not this is Sting, the man who is classic for giving 90 minute concerts to a T.<BR>And for writing songs as if he is limited by the space on an LP. Sting will rarely give you 12 songs on a new CD and with the American release cuts it down to 15 an instead of 18. What ever happened to giving us a live concert as it happend and giving all of it. It should have been two CD's and priced as one, Sting can afford it, he has more money than GOD. I do not believe Sting has ever been humble, there was no doubt on 9/11 in my mind that he was going to play his whole show and then rationlize it. But that is Sting.<BR>On All This Time his voice sounds great and so does the band, its a bit of a downer though. If you like the orginal versions of his songs do not buy. If you like it when artists re-work there songs buy it you will love it. Its a good CD add a Star if you worship him subtract one star if you want a fast upbeat Sting. <BR>There is no talking on the CD just music in case you are wondering, which I would have liked the intro to Fragile to have been included <BR>he had enough room left.<BR>Tantric Sting can go for hours unless of course he is singing and making a CD, in which case I guess Sting does not have, ALL (THAT MUCH) TIME.
B00004YX39|5.0|This is another album of timeless music. Must be heard on a killer system to appreciate all the fine points, vocal harmonies etc. Try to listen to it whilst driving west on Sunset- LA decadence and drugs (Not an endorsement by this writer!) is what inspired Gaucho. Two thumbs way up.
0062511408|5.0|Un libro que deberia ser parte del curriculum de todas las escuelas del mundo.  Un libro que te da el animo de seguir tus suenos y ideales.  Un libro que te inspira.  No, este no es un libro de como y cuando hacer las cosas y tu suenos.  Este libro contiene una historia que te hace identificar con el protagonista, y sientes que las aventuras que el tiene, o le han pasado son muy similares a las de uno. y cuando uno leer el como el supera estas cosas, uno se pone a pensar que si uno hiciera lo mismo, tambien saldria adelante en la vida.  no como un milloniario sino como una persona que tiene lo que busca en la vida... por que todo tiene un por que. Bueno, pues les rocomiendo este libro.  pues fue un libro que me fue regalado y ahora les comparto.  este libro recibe mas de 5 estrellas.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I must admit, I was surpised to see the relatively lower ratings for this album compared to previous DM efforts. In my opinion, this album sounds fresh and includes some of the bands' most mature work to date. The synthesizers sound great, and there is ample supportive space for the guitars. Overall, the sound is a bit on the more laid-back side, with only tracks like &quot;I feel Loved&quot; living up to the dance floor beats that everyone has expected DM to produce. But if they just did another Violator, it would have been a real shame. Rather, the band chose to mature and put out an album that shows that they still have something meaningful to contribute to the music world.
0446608955|5.0|Landan Carter's life was forever changed when he was 17. He fell in love for the first time to the girl he had never really looked at before. But it was more then that, he learned some hard life lessons that year, lessons he would never, ever forget. Every spring, when the grass is new and the air gentle ruffles his hair, he goes back in time. Back to the year, 1957. No longer is he 57, but 17, once again. He remembers every detail vividly, as if it just happened yesterday.<br />He never noticed Jamie Sullivan. Yeah he knew she was there, but he never noticed how pure her heart was. He figured there was nothing to notice. She was a plain looking, good two-shoes, who made every teenager in Beaufort look bad. She helped old people cross the street, raised money for the orphanage, read her Bible at school, every day. She was the perfect person, or so he thought. When she asks him to be in the play, he's a little hesitant, but he agrees.<br />And so begins his path towards love. His love isn't passionate or loud. It's soft spoken and subtle. He doesn't even realize he's falling in love with her, until he's smack dab in the middle of it.<br />Yes, this story is predictable and not original, but that's not the point. I think I love this book because it leaves you with the feeling that they found eternatl love within the other. Landan learns how to look past Jamie's outer appearance and see the beautiful heart within. Jamie sees past Landans rough exterior, he's just a sweet boy, longing for love on the inside. Usually I don't like books, if there is hardly any romance in it, but I can't imagine this book have being written any other way. Would I change anything in this book? Not a single word.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Okay...Okay... I did not enjoy it the way I enjoyed the original Star Wars.  Perhaps that might have something to do with the fact that I was ten years old at the time.  Maybe my standards have changed a bit over the past 25 years (at least I hope they have.)<br />Yes the acting is mostly bad and mostly lost in the spectacular (if sometimes bloated) special effects.  Hey, it's Star Wars people!  <br />Is Jar Jar annoying?  Yes, to my mid-30-year-old mind.  If I were 12 again?  This might just be the coolest movie ever.  <br />Enjoy it for what it is.  The extras alone are worth the purchase, and you get a pretty good kid's movie thrown in as a bonus.
0060987464|5.0|The Long Hard Road Out of Hell is a very good perspective from a highly controversial man. This book explores Brian's life in a very in-depth manner. Highlights include his Grandfather's basement, teenage things like losing his virginity and a section devoted to his relationship with Anton Lavey, founder of the Church of Satan. <br />This book is an fast read and great for fans and passerbys alike.
B00003CXFU|1.0|i went into this movie not expecting much. i expected not to like it. i had no idea that i would be absolutely repulsed. for one thing this idea has been done before. i had already seen civil action with john travolta, which is much better. for one thing travolta can act, and julia roberts can't.   but the big problem with the movie is erin herself. she is just so unlikable. there is a real problem with a movie when you're rooting against the \\"heroine.\\"  she has 3 kids, no husband and no job. i've heard this before. she plays the victim thing real well. she complains about everything. she demands a job just because her lawyer couldn't win her lawsuit for her. maybe it was the fact that she was't that injured or she  cursed at the judge and the jury. does she blame anything on herself? of course not. she blames it on ed, her lawyer(the only real likeable character in the film) for a job. she has no skills of course, and doesn't really wear any clothes. and of course when ed asks her to wear more business like clothes, she curses him off, like she does with everyone else. when ed offers to rehire her, she demands a raise, saying \\"i can get a job anywhere.\\" really? what arrogance. she's supposed to be a great mother but does she actually spend anytime with them. no? she dumps them off on her semi-boyfriend george. george eventually leaves because he doesn't want to be treated like some slave, but of course erin manages to say that \\"my two ex-husbands never gave me much choice.\\" please. ...  then there's the people themselves. it's horrible what's happening to a lot of them. it's sad. erin says they don't really care about the money, but they certainly complain a lot when their worried they might make 50 million dollars instead of 400 million.   there is just nothing to this movie. it's all been done before, and it's all predictable. the whole point of the movie is to like erin brockovich, but she just makes you want to smash your television. recommendation: see civil action or the verdict.  their  basically the same movies and there's no erin brockovich.
B000000W6X|3.0|Massive Attack's first two albums suffer because they can be dated.  They are so 1990's.  Their 1998 album is timeless.  Buy that one first.
B00004XQ83|5.0|As a fan of (most of) the Coen Brothers' off-beat films, I was totally smitten with this film from the first viewing. I bought the soundtrack, then after numerous viewings of the film bought the film on VHS format. While the original of \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" is here, that's a song I remember from childhood (I'm now in my late 40s) which was recorded by Burl Ives (in a somewhat edited form) for children. Of course, as a native of Louisiana, I also grew up hearing (and singing) \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" because it was written by a former governor of this state. This soundtrack introduced me not to the genre of \\"Old-Timey Music\\" as it's referred to in the film (my parents introduced me to that type of music--it was their generation) but to new artists in music. ...
B00005QIPH|4.0|There are great songs on this album that will infect your brain.  But, there is lots of filler on this album too.  I can't wait to see what happens when they go from club scene act to an artistic rock and roll band.  Watch out Radiohead if they make the transition.
0553579908|5.0|\\"A Game Of Thrones\\" is probably one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. It starts the entire Song of Ice and Fire saga, not with a bang, but with a regular nuke. From the savage Dothraki, to the treacherous and cruel Lannisters, to the honorable Starks and their tribulations, the entire novel was a trip to a fantasy world of barbaric adventure. I laughed, cried, felt anguish, terror, excitement, sometimes happiness... it was amazing how a novel could elicit such intense emotional reactions. The characters felt like real people, far away from the tedious archetypes that abound in fantastic literature; Tyrion, Eddard, Daenerys, Arya, all of them became my friends, and their fate was very important for me.<br />So does the sequel \\"A Clash Of Kings\\" sustain the excitement? I think yes. The plot doesn't feel as `tight' and fast paced as with \\"AGOT\\" but that's because lots of new characters and situations are introduced. There's still the feeling of menace permeating the story. People you like can die; there are no certainties in this fantasy world, no invincible heroes, only human beings in a very hostile environment, trying to survive, sometimes failing catastrophically.<br />I disagree with reviewers who talk about the supposed moral vagueness of the book, arguing that you can't really discern who's good and who's evil. Not true. Villains are clearly villains. The Lannisters, except for Tyrion, are all brutal sadists, Theon Greyjoy is as sympathetic as Pol Pot, and King Joffrey, the Boltons, Littlefinger, Gregor Clegane and lots more are utter fiends. It's true that some characters are ambiguous, like Stannis Baratheon and the Hound, but I think it's easy to make moral distinctions among the rest...<br />Let's hope the third part \\"A Storm Of Swords\\" reaches some kind of climax. This book, although great, feels a little transitional.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a great movie!  I would like to comment specifically on this edition.  I have had it on VHS(the 6 tape version), the first DVD release and now this release.  This release is highly superior in every way to the first DVD release.  The last release looked like it was copied directly onto DVD from the VHS tapes; the picture quality was not at all improved, there were no special features and the credits still ran at the beginning and ending of each of the original six episodes.  It was easier than dealing with six tapes, but otherwise a disappointment.  I'm so much happier with this one!  The picture quality is so much richer, there are only credits at the beginning and end of the entire movie and there are some very interesting special features.  I wasn't sure if it would be worth it to buy the newer release on DVD since I already had the first one, but I'm so glad I did!
B000002HAF|5.0|Very creative. Every song is like totally catchy and very clever. And it is also very funny to listen to this for the first time, cause you totally notice how much bands take off of this band. I heard people mention Nirvana, but make it less enthousiastic and then you have Weezer. Some of my favorite tracks are &quot;Break My Body&quot;, &quot;Oh My Golly&quot;, and &quot;Vamos&quot;. ut it still is almost impossible to select just a few.
0141301155|2.0|I got this book for the kids,but all they did was read<br />about 1-2 pages,then kicked it aside in favor of \\"Harry<br />Potter\\".I tried to read the book,but I could'nt make<br />myself stay focused on this dull,lackluster book.I ended<br />up using it as fuel for the grill.At least this book is good for<br />something.....
0399134204|5.0|While the coventional appeal of Tan's &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; has mainly focused on its entertainment value, the element which places her novel indefinately in the &quot;modern classics&quot; genre, is its profound depth.  The book alludes fiery femaninity and exists as a commanding vessel containing the enigmas of matriarchal beauties. Thematically timeless, &quot;Joy Luck..&quot; sifts past the typical &quot;female&quot; qualities of nurture, patience and emotional endurance to expose the realities of the innate, instictual bond between women, and the definitively female capability to reach beyond self-absorbed ambition to enlighten oneself with their role in relation to others.  Emotionally disturbing at times, the story bounces from depression, haunting regret, anxiety and metal numbness to surface the Essence of a woman's life. Life has no known goal, purpose or point. All that one can learn is that life is nothing more than yourself, and the people who contribute to your evolvement;  and that love can only be channeled through the network of female bonds. Simply written, yet profound, this was the one required literary work that I actually read-- and enjoyed.
B000006NPY|5.0|It is one of saddest albums I have ever heard.<BR>-Ava adore - the best song on the album<BR>-Once upon a time - very sad... &quot;mother you know I miss you so&quot;<BR>-Tale of dusty and pistol Pete - to listen during rainy autumn<BR>-Behold!

B00005QZWI|5.0|I've been a fan of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit since I was very young and have been waiting for a live action movie to come out since then.  The soundtrack to this movie is very good at adding that element that made it, along with the wonderful special effects, something that I will listen to and watch for years to come!  I think the theme music for the Black Riders was perfect.  The deep bass instruments along with the coral voices of the music is haunting in its own way.  The one track on the CD called &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; has to be one of my favorites too. It just describes the Hobbits to a tee.  I can't say enough about the music or the movie! Can't wait until the first movie comes out on DVD and for the Two Towers to premiere in December!
B000000W6R|4.0|&quot;Landslide&quot;, even though not their song, is the best on the album. You need to buy it if you a rock fan, but this is not for everyone. Some songs are a little bit dull, but the instrumentation is wonderful.
B000001DTM|5.0|Simply put, this is U2's finest album. From beginning to end, you won't be able to stop listening to this album(I haven't for 10 years!!!) It is filled with incredible music. How can anyone NOT like \\"One\\"? \\"Mysterious Ways\\" is tremendous, but you knew that already. But it's the other songs, ones that a non-U2 fan wouldn't know, that make this album so wonderful. Songs like \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses?\\", \\"Until The End Of The World\\", and \\"So Cruel\\" are just amazingly good. This was the transition album from the \\"Joshua Tree\\"/\\"Rattle & Hum\\" style music. Let me just say, there is not 1 bad song on the album, and it is my favorite album of all time. Bottom line, if you are not a fan of U2, you WILL BE after hearing this album!
0195067142|5.0|What a wonderful gift from my loving wife of 42 years, Marilyn. My name is Bob McKnight, I am aged 65, served in the U.S. Army on Japan's southernmost big island, Kyushu, less than 11 years after Japan's surrender.  Thanks to brave people like Dr Sledge, I found fewer American soldiers' graves there!<br />This book has touched my very soul.  I was riveted to each page by Dr Sledge's gripping, piercing, engrossing words... words that kept slapping me in the face with the realization that these young men were experiencing a living hell!.. And they were doing it so that young boys like me would be able to enjoy a better world when we grew up!  I an fortunate to be a native of Florida's panhandle and am quite familiar with Mobile, Marion Institute, Auburn University, Montevallo, as well as The University of Florida (my alma mater) where Dr Sledge grew up and excelled.<br />I recommend this book, not as a 'war' novel, but as a textbook for all young people in the United States.  Dr Sledge has taught us 'how' to live.. to grow up.. to deal with adversity and all sorts of unpleasantness.. how important teamwork is.. to love.. to laugh.. to cry.. to accept responsibility.. to strive for success! I thank his parents, his wife and children and Dr Eugene B. Sledge for this wonderful book!  And you too Marilyn, I love you!... Robert W. (Bob) McKnight
6305428220|5.0|I honestly thought that this is one of the best movies I ever saw. I'm a huge fan of Josh Hartnett and his talent really stood out and so did it for the other actors. It's one of my favs and a good movie for teen horror lovers. I would give this a million stars if I could!
B000002NHN|5.0|I first heard Loreena on &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; CD and I was immediately enthralled. Her music takes you to faraway places. This CD will melt away your day's worries. I highly recommend it.

0446525537|5.0|This book is one of the best by far that I have read in a long time.  Nicholas Sparks can interest the reader and keep them interested throughout the entire book, wanting to read more from him.  One thought, don't read the book then see the movie thinking you'll see a mirror image.  The book keeps the story \\"sweet\\", still sad but wonderful just the same.  The movie takes a little time to get \\"sweet\\", then you dig for the tissues during the last hour.  I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books and plan to continue with each and every book he writes.  I hope he never stops.  He is now my #1 author!
B00000FZ1V|3.0|What a fantastic movie.  I was so pysched to watch Ghostbusters again since it's been probably 10 years since I last watched it.  It was on sale, so I picked it up and sat down tonight to play homage to Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis.  I stuck the disc in my DVD player, popcorn and blanket ready, cat curled up on the sofa, patiently waiting for access to my lap.  I wanted to watch the special features first, but I couldn't get ANY of them to work.  I kept getting a disc error.  Finally, after several frustrating minutes, I was able to get the movie to play.  I settled down and just when I got in the heart of the movie (about half-way through), the disc just stopped playing.  I tried and tried to get it to play again, with no luck.  I remembered seeing on this site that several other people had the same problem, so here I am, warning others that apparently, there really IS a bad batch of Ghostbusters DVD's out there.  So if you plan on purchasing this fantastic movie, be prepared.  You may have to make several runs back and forth to the retailer in order to obtain a working copy.  None of this has diminished the quality of the movie, but I sure was upset I didn't get to experience it right away.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I give Michael Jackson's Thriller FIVE stars and I don't care for the title track, Billie Jean or Beat It (all which were world-wide hits). The album really opened the door for Michael's solo career thanks to, in part, the 25th Anniversary of Motown and the video for Thriller. At that time very innovated!!<br />I enjoy this album in large part because of The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, P.Y.T and the Lady in My Life...all very R&amp;B soulful tracks.<br />On the remastered versions includes behind the scenes (so to speak) with Quincy interview and a home demo for Billie Jean. As a fan of Michael Jackson-and I assure many fans agree...that this was a wonderful move by Michael and Sony. Rare tracks without going underground! :-)<br />Included tracks on the remastered version of Thriller are...<BR>Someone in the Dark...track for the ET Storybook...really rare to hear. Nice slow track.<br />Billie Jean home demo...what can we say? a work in progress...a real treat, even for those of us who are not a fan of the track!! :-)<br />Voice over session from Thriller-including the never heard before 2nd verse. With Vincent Price...another wonderful treat.<br />and a song called Carousel...a pleasant song but I am glad that if a song had to been omitted the first time around, this song was a good choice to leave out compared to the other tracks on the album. It's another rare track if you don't get bootlegs from the underground<br />All in all, you can't go wrong with this cd, even if you have the first version cd because the extras and the remastered version of the original songs are well worth the money!!
B000007VCM|5.0|Love is without a doubt the single most overlooked album of the '80s and ancestor to any number of musical styles which were to follow in the '90s. Groups as diverse as Nirvana, U2, Nine Inch Nails, Lenny Kravitz, Concrete Blonde, The Sundays, Weezer and many, many others clearly follow in the footsteps of this incredible, groundbreaking album that (oddly enough) few in the US have ever heard of, in spite of its massive worldwide success.<br />Essentially a stripped-down, skillfully guitar-driven album in the tradition of all great rock and roll, Love comes off in different ways to different listeners and is in the end quintessentially unclassifyable and unlike any major-label release before or since, in any genre. It is at the same time mystical and wordly, brooding and uplifting, scathing and soothing. Obvious to all listeners, however, is the degree to which Love has influenced all popular music through the two decades since its release.<br />Look at the ratings here and elsewhere, then buy Love. It's one of those rare albums about which I can say, regardless of who you are or which type of music you prefer: you won't be disappointed.
B00000K31V|4.0|Much slime will ensue. Though I must admit it can't hold a candle to the carnage which runs rampant in most Cronenberg movies, this has a serious squirm factor. The opening scene, set in a rustic church, seems like some bizzare, twisted dream only Cronenberg could formulate. For some reason the sight of ten fleshy blobs sitting on peoples' laps while pulsating and screeching is one of the most deeply disturbing things i've seen in campy sci-fi movies since the facehugger in Alien.<br />The plot itself is rather sketchy and confusing, though I personally think the acting was potentially shaky, giving a more realistic portrayal of video game characters. Anyone who plays Baldur's Gate or any of the proliferate spawn games will appreciate the dialogue between them and the human players.<br />Overall...eeeeeeeww[...]
B000000WJZ|5.0|I bought this cd right when in came out, back in '93 or whenever, and loved it dearly from day one. Admittedly hadn't listen to it for years - I'd become more inured to the punk rock side of the aisle, and had lost the patience to abide six minute long rock songs. Anyway, a few weeks ago I found myself in an emotional whirlpool, the usual stuff - relationship on the skids, where's my life headin', blah blah blah. Seeking solace in music, I felt coldly distant from my copious cd collection; felt it didn't have anything proper to offer me. Suddenly, for some reason I knew I had to dig up the Pumpkin's &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; and that I'd find a track which would recharge me. Well, I found the cd and dusted it off (I was serious about not having played it for years), and found my &quot;salvation&quot; in track no. 9. Folks, notwithstanding its inappropriately mundane name, &quot;Mayonaise&quot; is one of the most perfect and emotionally evocative songs ever written, just incredible. The rest of the album doesn't flag far behind. I guess I just had to be in the right mood to connect with this sorta music, and I know that in the past few weeks, I've hardly listened to anything else. All in all, this album comes pretty damn close to perfection.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|So my idea of a really good rock and roll band is something that will make you want to go out and break some stuff after having listened to it.  Well, At the Drive In definately fits the bill.  Some times, I am not sure exactly what they are singing about.  However, it gets me charged up.  Someone described them as the future of rock and roll.  I hope so.  Hopefully, being on the Beastie Boys' grand royal label will help their career flourish as it seems promising.  Listen up to these guys and you to might want to break something soon.
1561005533|1.0|I am a big fan of Wilbur smith.  He is a master of the historical novel.<br />The audio cassette editions of his books, manufactured by Billiance audito, however are so poor in their quality as to be unusable and annoying to the listener.  <br />Brilliance audio's technical reproduction of books is the poorest quality of any that I have purchased- I'm an avid user of books on tape.<br />I purchased this book to listen to on a cross country drive.  The uneven audio necessitated a constant adjustment of the volume level.  At moments the audio was so low that it was virtually unintelligible.  If you increase the volume another portion would be so loud as to be painful (usually spoken segments by characters).  This requisite constant adjustments in volume made this excellent story a real pain to listen to.<br />I thought that this might just have been an anomaly with this one particular tape.  I purchased another unabridged novel &quot;Warlock&quot; also by Wilbur Smith and manufactured by brilliance audio - it was the same.  <br />I was so angry after investing a significant sum to purchase these tapes that I called the manufacturer, Brilliance audio's national customer service manager.  She apologized and shipped me a replacement book on tape  that she assured me had good production quality.  I was shocked to find it the same as the previous books.  My car stereo is manufactured by Bose and is high end.  <br />The same problem exists when attempting to play these tapes on a sony walkman cassette player.  My conclusion is that Brilliance audio has no quality control or is using a cheaper tape or reproduction method than all of the other audio tape manufacurers.  <br />I wish Wilbur Smith had hired Jim Dale the reader of the Harry Potter books and had his novels recorded at another studio because those books are performed and reproduced magnificently.  <br />The audio renditions of both Warlock and River God, however, are simply poor quality and not worth their cost andunless you don't mind adjusting the volume continuously as you listen - don't buy them.
B00005NOOH|5.0|[Following is an incremental review spanning my audience experience of 'The World At War' series over 29 years. The first part is my assessment in 2002 of the series content based on having seen the original and several rerun television releases, and on owning the year 2000 PT Video PAL release, comparable with the first US NTSC release. The final stage is my comment on 30 March 2012 about the Blu-ray release - angled more on the technical aspects of that release.]<br /><br />The vast body of documentary-making about the Second World War has nothing to compare with Jeremy Isaacs' \\"The World At War\\", made for Britain's Thames Television in 1973-74.  The term miniseries is inadequate for this giant of quality and quantity.  It stands so far above everything remotely similar as to be in a class of its own.  With some 32 hours of viewing culled from millions of feet of wartime US, Russian, British, German and Japanese newsreel and propaganda film, and unique postwar interviews, this is a MEGAseries.  Sustained high quality shines through, although almost 40 years have elapsed since it was made--and more than 67 years since the archival footage was shot.  The DVD release is a gem which everyone interested in the genre will want to own.  It is no exaggeration to describe this series as a milestone of civilisation.<br /><br />The many postwar interviews gathered for this series with wartime Allied and Axis political leaders, generals, resistance leaders, diplomats, and ordinary and not-so-ordinary soldiers and citizens, are astonishing in their range, candour and insight.  It is impossible here to do justice to these interviewees.  Mountbatten, LeMay, Prince Bernhard, Durrell, Westphal, Manteuffel, Guingand, Galland, Warlimont, Fuchida, Genda, Galbraith, and Samuelson are just some of the famous names.<br /><br />Albert Speer, who was Hitler's architect and later his Armaments Minister, talks frankly and contritely about the coverup of the \\"Final Solution\\" and his close relations with Hitler.  Statesmen Averell Harriman (US), Anthony Eden (UK), and Koichi Kido (Japan), among others, recall diplomatic and political byplay and insiders' views ranging from Churchill to the Emperor of Japan.  The top WWII Japanese air ace to survive the war, Saburo Sakai, recalls the youthful patriotic fervour of his fellow fliers and the impact of Japan's reversal of fortunes. Marshal of the (British) Air Force Sir Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris explains his strategy for bombing Germany as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command. General Curtis LeMay recalls his experiences leading mass formations of the US Eighth Air Force on daylight bombing raids over Europe. US, Russian, Japanese, Dutch and British warriors and housewives recall dealing out and receiving the horrors of war.  Hitler's youngest secretary, Gertrude \\"Trudl\\" Junge, talks of the bizarre underground life in the Fuhrerbunker.  Eisenhower's driver, Kay Summersby, recalls her former boss's skills and frustrations in coordinating multinational Allied command.  The last prominent survivor of the 1944 Stauffenberg plot against Hitler, Ewald Heinrich von Kleist, recalls his days as a young Wehrmacht lieutenant and gives insights into why the German anti-Nazi movement was small and why it failed.  Admiral Karl D&ouml;nitz and U-boat ace Otto Kretschmer recall the battle of the Atlantic.  General Sir Brian Horrocks, the inspirational British commander who led XXX Corps in the drive on Arnhem (played by Edward Fox in [[ASIN:B000WC39SG A Bridge Too Far [Blu-ray]]]) talks of Operation Market Garden, the rivalry between Montgomery and Patton, and the burdens of military command.  The overlay of archival footage of the actual parachute and glider drops in Market Garden make the corresponding scenes in the movie, \\"A Bridge Too Far\\", look like home movie sequences.  Linking it all is a matter-of-fact commentary which soars above chauvinism and prejudice.  It is read in deadpan style by the distinguished British actor Laurence Olivier--among his finest work.<br /><br />The globe-changing civilisation-shaking upheaval of the Second World War continues to fascinate an immense worldwide readership and viewing audience.  If you, too, want to better understand how so much decent, intelligent and cultivated humanity descended into and in some cases survived that madness, view the grim and gripping \\"The World At War\\" series, and prepare to be amazed.<br /><br />Update in November 2011: Good to see that this landmark documentary series remains available in DVD. I think it is time for the copyright owners to consider some digital restoration and a Blu-ray release. [Exactly what I later learnt they were already doing.]<br /><br />Update 30 March 2012: I recently bought the Blu-ray release of 'The World At War' published under the History Channel label by A&E Networks, and available here on Amazon. It has been extensively restored for this release by Fremantle Media. Don't expect video transfer of WWII black and white combat footage, or even 1970s color video and 16mm transfers, ever to look like current full HD, but the restoration is excellent and a significant advance on the earlier DVD release. It has removed many artefacts visible in the DVDs and improved overall resolution, often by going back to original material. Even the archival wartime footage looks vastly better. Aspect ratio has been converted from 4:3 to 16:9. An interesting \\"making of\\" about the restoration (including new contributions from original series producer Sir Jeremy Isaacs), added to the extra features, explains how the restorers agonized over the issue of clipping some of the image in the aspect ratio change and how they minimised apparent image loss. Surprisingly the aspect ratio change is least noticeable in the archival footage. It is most noticeable in the full-face interviews to camera which were shot specially for the series in 4:3. The restorers chose to chop foreheads and leave chins when full-face 4:3 framing was very tight, as it often was for the early days of small screen TV. I'm still viewing the new disks, but I have seen enough - comparing the same random segments on DVD and Blu-ray viewed on a 65-inch HD plasma TV - to highly recommend the Blu-ray release. Anyone with a Region A Blu-ray player (note this release is region encoded) should now prefer this release to the earlier DVD version. Another nice feature of the Blu-ray release is total reworking of the disk navigation: the annoying and often confusing time-line episode navigation of the old DVD release is gone. The content is as amazing as ever for its insight and quality, and I see no reason to alter my earlier praise for content above. This is a jewel of a documentary series to own, explore and appreciate, and the Blu-ray is currently the best form in which to see it.shed British actor Laurence Olivier--among his finest work.<br /><br />The globe-changing civilisation-shaking upheaval of the Second World War continues to fascinate an immense worldwide readership and viewing audience.

B00003CX8U|5.0|All That Jazz is not yet out on DVD.  I am hoping that, after seeing \\"Fosse\\" on PBS that more people will demand it.  It is Fosse at his best, and one of the few places that non-New York theater goers can see Fosse's work.  Ben Vereen is terrific (a great humanitarian, and a personal friend of mine, ha), Scheider seems to have the Fosse attitude down, and all the suporting cast is phenomenal.  Send in your vote for this to be put out on DVD!
B00005JKT8|3.0|How can anyone expect a movie about time travel to be consistant and realistic. With all the stuff out there that gives you nightmares, bombards your ears with bad language and your eyes with explicit sex, a sweet clean movie that makes you feel kind of good is a welcome change. If you can't believe a girl would jump off the Brooklyn bridge to get a guy, take a look at Hugh Jackman...total biscuit.
B000002H38|5.0|I'm old-fashioned! At a time when record lables are frantically trying to force the next so-called 'Diva' upon an unsuspecting music lover I, for one, tend to 'zig while they zag'. Simply put....while everyone else is concentrating on the next darling of the Pop/Soul genre ( Jill Scott...take notes! ) I rush back to my roots and wait for all the hoopla to die down before stepping back into my local record store to be barraged once again with that 'Next Big Name!' But while other consumers pocketbooks fall victim to the Marketing/PR depts. enticing come-on's I wisely dance around those 'snake-oil' salesmen and purchase music that is destined for longevity/classics....not for a momentary pleasure. Well, for the most part I do! Although I am guilty of buying a Mariah Carey cd ( hopefully we live and learn! ). Anyway, that's how it came about to my purchasing a second copy of Anita Baker's \\" Rapture \\". <br />To put it simply a more succinct album title would be hard to find. I've yet to meet anyone who hasn't found this disc to be an absolute joy and in some cases an almost revelatory experience to one degree or another. Anita's voice, smokey and dangerous one moment, is innocent and yearning the very next. The first single \\" Sweet Love \\" which sets the album off on just the right note ( no pun intended! ), is at once R&B, Soul, Gospel and with just the right touch of Jazz thrown in as well. She exudes a confidence and masterful technique that I only hear in some of Jazz's greatest female singers i.e. Sarah Vaughn being the obvious parallel. Each song for that matter complements the last so well that I don't believe I've ever put this disc on without listening all the way through non-stop. It's truly that good! My personal highlight being \\" Caught Up In The Rapture \\" is a perfect example of subtle phrasing and tonal quality that I suspect you will never hear in a Toni Braxton or Whitney Houston cd! Their fine singers in their own right but they simply do not possess theemotional maturity and the musical insight that Anita so obviously does. These are songs that only a singer who is truly 'grounded' in all aspects of harmony/scales could understand and release with such awe inspiring results. No doubt we all, as music lovers, have dozens of cd's with singers emoting on the incredible joys and tragic heartache that \\" Love \\" sometimes deals us but Anita is one of those indescribable singers who makes you feel as though she's lived through these songs and is passing along some hard-earned wisdom. Definitely a cd to enjoy with a glass of wine and a broken heart. <br />In the end while rummaging through my own 'music library' only Marvin Gaye's \\" Let's Get It On \\" comes close enough for me to equate as having as much sheer power, intensity and true passion! And ultimately rewarding the listener with an almost religious experience, whether it's your intial introduction to this remarkable disc or even, like me, your hundreth! A more emotinally draining/revelatory experience would be hard to find! After 15 years of listening to Anita Baker I find I'm still in \\" Rapture!! \\"
0671024256|5.0|I realize that Stephen King survived his accident to give us writers this book--it is an invaluable tool, and one I shall use in my tool box.<br />As a successful writer King lets you into his world and illustrates how the craft evolves. His methods, his strategies and his touch of the unexplained weave a great tale, and at the same time provide nourishing food for thought.<br />I recommend this book to anyone remotely serious in the craft and aspiring writers alike.
B00000K31V|5.0|I can't believe the morons who gave this movie a bad review!  It truely is a great movie if you stop to consider it.  The plot can be confusing, but what's great about the film is how open it is to interpritation.  There are subplots that may exist, or may not, depending on how you look at it.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I thought this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<BR>Couldn't wait for it to be over.  Nicole was pretty good in it, it was the story line that was just empty.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|Enrique Iglesias. Well, surely you've heard of him, but you're debating why (or if) you should buy his latest CD. Yes, you should. From the emotional, introspective debut single \\"Hero,\\" Enrique charms his fans with the soft, soothing melody. The rest of the album is comparatively different, but just as good. Highlights inculde:<br />1. Escape: You can't escape Enrique, or his love. This song comes on very smoothly, then progresses to a spicy salsa beat. It has nice lyrics and is overall an excellent track.<BR> <BR>2. Don't Turn Off the Lights: There's something so fresh, so positively invigorating about this track. It makes you feel like you could just fly away into the sunshine. The tune is unmistakabley Enrique and quite catchy as well. It's almost trip-hop beat fused with the lyte Latin flavor makes for a real winner.<br />3. Love To See You Cry: This is a very interesting song, I really like the tune. It seems to go on a while, though.<br />7. Maybe: This is my second favorite. It's so soft and delicate, so remorseful. It's just a beautiful song you have to hear.<br />8. One Night Stand: Another winner. Enrique wanted something more from the relationship, but it's quite obvious it was only a \\"fling.\\" It's got a wonderful beat.
0380788624|5.0|This is a really long book and I hesitated to start on it since my track record on finishing such is less than stellar.  Turns out I was happily turning pages all the way to the end.  Like Stephenson's other books it's built around an interesting view of the future, in this case an &quot;off-shore data bank&quot; service that depends on excellent crytography.  The book is really two separate but related stories, one set in WWII and one a bit in the future, with the text jumping back and forth between them.  Now, if someone had told me that before I started I would have groaned, but Stephenson holds it all together and makes it work beautifully.  Good read.
B0000073NC|4.0|This album is creatively better than any of their other pre-Lovedrive stuff, but it needs to be remastered in at least 20 bit form. As soon as this happens, I'll buy another copy. <br />To everyone who is crying about the Scorps going commercial after Roth's departure, please wake up from dreamland. The Scorpions were NEVER a hair band even though so many tried to put them in that category. These guys have always been a very heavy and sophisticated rock band all the way up to 1990's Crazy World. Of course their peak time period was the Lovedrive, Animal Magnetism, Blackout, and Love At First Sting era. Please remember that Rudolf's ultimate dream was to become a household name in the rock/metal genre. His dream came true because he and Klaus Meine gave the fans what they wanted, intelligent hard driving rock, and positive progressive ballads that spoke volumes about their creativity, compassion, and integrity. They Never wrote the kind of cheesy songs that Poison, Rat, Motely Crue and other glam bans were famous for. Let's face it, their latter offerings were almost as underrated as their pre-lovedrive efforts. All of these Scorps CDs are now remastered, so get your copy before they are all gone. The Rush, Van Halen, Deep Purple, and Iron Maiden-Canadian remasters are also well worth the money.
B00000JMOF|5.0|What can be said about this classic that im sure everyone reading this has seen at least once? The transfer to DVD is very impressive and the extras are quite entertaining and informative.<BR>The DVD version includes a couple of  scenes that were deleted in some parts of the world, which is explained in the bonus Frankenstein Files. If you like gothic horror at its best, this is one for you.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie is the best in sound and adventure that I have in by vast DVD collection. The movie has added footage that makes it better than the original theatrical release. By far the thundering bass and the many different types of sounds make the viewer view things on the screen that would normally be overlooked on a normal television without surround sound. When I say surround sound, I do not mean a setup with small satellite speakers you can buy for under [price] at Best Buy or Fry's Electronics. If you want to feel the real experience, you must get a Mission, Klipsch, Infinity, Acoustic Research, or comparable surround sound setup. I tried out the below [price] Sony, JVC, Kenwood etc. setups and they just do not have what it takes to provide the deep base and the crisp highs not to mention the realistic vocals.<br />By far this movie is the test of all tests for any surround sound system. It is a must own.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Hands down, the best movie ever! And Oscar caliber all around! Without a doubt! Deserves Oscar for best movie! Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly deliver Oscar caliber performances! And Ron Howard deserves DGA and Oscar for his directing! It made me laugh! It made me cry!
0140430350|4.0|This book is often called biting or cynical, but what most appealed to me was its realism.  It is very different from many other books written during this time period in that it doesn't get too sentimental about innocence.  Amelia is in many ways the ideal woman of her day, but Thackeray sees her as a human being with weaknesses as well as virtues.  Becky would normally be branded as the gold-digger or adventuress, but she has some excellent qualities which really shine through, particularly towards the end of the book.  It is an enjoyable read, filled with wit and humour as it explores the ups and downs of the heroines' lives.  The only slight drawback is that it is very long and sometimes convoluted (the only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars) but the conclusion for me was absolutely worth it.  A classic for a reason.
0446677450|4.0|Robert Kiyosaki's books are all the rage right now.  At least four have been on the business best seller list, and I see people carrying his books on the bus and college campuses.  It's a phenomena, what's going on?<br />Overty, Kiyosaki has tapped into a new pool of people who are ready to change their attitudes about money.  Make no mistake, this is not a how-to book.  This is an attitude book.  It's about changing core values and priorities.  However, once that shift has been made, there are a number of useful starting points for making quick progress, and he mentions a few of these, such as the classic &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; by Napoleon Hill.<br />Covertly, Kiyosaki is addressing something far more personal than money -- How money and success warp our family relationships.  Many people face dynamics of &quot;do it our way, or you will be a failure.&quot;  This book offers a choice of success dynamics, and illustrates in a personal way the types of family that this creates.<br />This book is worth all the hype, because of the value change that it is inspiring.  It brings this entire dynamic into the public eye, and makes it acceptable to talk about different beliefs of success.  I'm looking into a cashflow club near me.<br />This book is not a classic, primarily because of the hype and the writing style.  It is unlikely that this book will be as approachable in ten years, even though I'm sure that many will remember getting something out of it.<br />However, the point of change is now, and if you want to build wealth, instead of the persuit of more money, read this book.
B00000DGUG|5.0|From start to finish, Alanis Morisette delivers a veritable musical tour d'force through \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.\\"  Starting with the amazing \\"Front Row,\\" \\"Supposed...\\" couldn't begin any better.  Through it's real, up-close lyrics that challenge the ambiguous and embrace reality, and extensive multi-tracking that complements the song stunningly, Alanis creates an unbelievable song that could have been a great single.  \\"Baba,\\" is where Alanis's spiritual side is displayed amazingly.  She challenges the misguided stunningly through her lyrics that demand to be deciphered.  The rendition of \\"Ave Maria...\\" at the end is as grand as it is real.  \\"Thank U,\\" the first single off the cd, is an interesting song that questions, asks, and attempts to decide.  The song is gifted with gentle drumming, that fits the tone perfectly.  \\"Are You Still Mad,\\" just asks, and doesn't apologize.  Alanis isn't exactly apologetic over her foibles, just like her \\"you.\\"  \\"Sympathetic Character,\\" is a roaring track that shows Alanis's creative side through its composition, and her fears and reality through its introspective, if carping, lyrics.  She complements and corrects beautifully within the same stanza.  She manipulates the lyrics to fit the music so uniquely.  \\"That I Would Be Good,\\" utilizes lyrics that express her fears of failure in society's eyes, with the accompaniment of her breathy playing of a flute.  Relaxed, stunning, and real, this is a very authentic piece that captures Alanis's emotion perfectly.  Alanis, ever the story teller, does so over the canvas of the 5 minute 23 second \\"The Couch,\\" with the back-up of drums.  It's almost a flashback, or even a foreshadowing, with Alanis taking a different perspective as singer.  It's different, but it works.  \\"Can't Not,\\" speaks to society, and does so brilliantly with Alanis singing various parts differently.  \\"UR,\\" is a fun track, reflective and progressive all in the same instant.  Low-key it is, but effectively so.\\"I Was Hoping,\\" will capture you.  The dark tones, the spirited protracted singing of the story Alanis is painting, and the infectious chorus of \\"I was hoping...\\" demand notice.  \\"One,\\" finds Alanis talking to society again, questioning what \\"average\\" and \\"individualism\\" actually mean.  \\"Would Not Come,\\" has Alanis in yet another roaring song that employs voice layering aptly, where society's definition of happiness and society's standards and virtues are questioned.  In \\"Unsent,\\" Alanis puts five love letters to five very different men to music, in a song that is as introspective as beautiful.  \\"So Pure,\\" is another roaring song on \\"Supposed...\\"  You can't help but sing along, because of the distinct pulse the instrumentation imparts to the song and the amazing tone the lyrics set.  Alanis sings with enlivened passion and brilliantly at that.  \\"Joining You,\\" challenges, questions, and starts to draw conclusions as only Alanis can.  \\"Heart of the House,\\" and \\"Your Congratulations,\\" address family, touchingly and tragically.  Particularly on \\"Your Congratulations,\\" backed with a stunning, almost ballerina-inspired playing of the piano, Alanis sings a heart-wrenching song that is compounded by tear-jerking singing and melancholy strings.<br />\\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" shows us a very personal side of Alanis.  This amazing cd tackles issues and addresses family, past loves, and inner self in an amazing 71 minute 50 second cd, which could have been longer.  Alanis is a creative artist, wonderful lyricist that isn't afraid to use her extensive vocabulary to express her ideas and thoughts, and talented, able to play the harmonica, flute, and piano proficiently on this cd.  The lyric booklet is a substantial twenty pages long, and a delight to read.  Alanis expresses herself so well.  Kudos to Alanis Morisette on a strong effort and an even better product that challenges, affirms, and provokes thought.
B00003CXXS|3.0|As much as i wanted to like this film i was dissapointed. After the first two J.P. movies perhaps i was wrong to expect something original. Its all too familiar and i found it boring. The one thing i do like about this third installment is that its the last.
B00005JKT8|4.0|...It moved too slow and the ending ended....quickly.<BR>Leopold is a poor Duke living in the 1870's and for a man in his time he is very advanced and has high hopes for the future with his ideas only no one really believes in his ideas least of all his uncle who now wants Leopold to marry and settle down with a rich woman. On the night where he has to make his choice on a bride a strange man named Stuart is lurking around Leopold's mansion in Brooklyn. Leo chases him and they fall off the bridge landing in the present time and here Stuart tells Leo that Leo is his great, great grandfather. In comes Kate, Stuart's ex girlfriend who now lives above Stuart's apartment and Leo is drawn to her, but she doesn't believe in love nor the magic of its feeling, but Leo is a true gentleman who decides to court Kate only with one problem, what will he do when he goes back to his time?<BR>A sweet romantic comedy, but not a movie for action lovers. This is solely a movie for Hugh Jackman fans who get to see him with a lovely accent and quite a different role than the other movies he has made. He is truly a rising star. <BR>The ending was rather silly though. Everything happened in less than 3 minutes when it should have had at least 10-15 minutes to let us indulge what was happening. Meg Ryan is still acting like if she were again making French Kiss but still a lovely comedy.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I went into A Beautiful Mind with doubts. I was wary of the hype it had recieved thus far and even more wary of the hype the actors Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly had recieved. <BR>The films opening featured a most beautifully scored song entitled \\"A Kaleidoscope of Mathematics\\" that ensnared me immediately. With the score adding a few points immediately I settled in for the ride. I was pleasantly pleased with what I found along the way. <BR>Crowe's performance as John Nash was far from a disappointment. It was touching, loving and extremely real. His stress and anguish shined above what could be expected of him and his sincere understanding of the setbacks in his characters life aided him in giving a wonderful performance. Jennifer Connelly portrayed Nash's wife with vigor and deep sentimentality. My heart ached for her as she tried with all her might to understand her husbands problems. Her determination to make the love between Alicia and John seem real was truly beautiful.<br />The second half of the film was filled with those magical movie moments where you see the real truth shine through and it touches you as a viewer so deeply. I shed quite a large number of tears in sadness and happiness for this film and it's characters. It is a stunning love story between a troubled man and his wife. And it is a love story between the audience and the entirity of itself as a film. It is a film that I hope will help others understand the struggles in the lives of others. It certainly opened my eyes and let light shine through. <BR>I recommend this movie to those who are true fans of films, to those with an open and caring mind and heart. If you have these qualities and wish to see a captivating film, go see A Beautiful Mind, you should not be disappointed.
0804106304|4.0|A series of short stories woven into a continuous narrative, rather than a novel -- but superbly written all the same. Very human, and to my mind as durable as Pearl S. Buck's &quot;The Good Earth.&quot; A successful autobiography of the contemporary American Chinese experience and its evolution through multiple generations in Chinese and Chinese-American families.
B00003CXS4|5.0|From beginning to end, this movie is incredible.  The characters all fit together so perfectly.  I saw this in the theatre without any preconceived expectations and was extremely happy with the experience.  So much so that I went back and saw it two more times. <br />Recently, I have purchased this movie on DVD and have already viewed it a couple of times.  It's definately in my top ten of all-time.<br />Each character in Snatch is funny in their own right.  Like Tarantino films, you find yourself laughing when maybe you shouldn't be.  However, there are plenty of times you should laugh in this movie.  It's hilarious.  This is modern film making at it's finest.<br />My favorite line in the whole movie is when Tyrone says, \\"It was a funny angle.\\"  The accents in the movie are great.  In the beginning, it took me a while to get use to the dialect, but now that I've seen it several times I have no trouble at all.  Well, maybe I still need to work a little on Pitt's \\"pikey\\" accent.  It will take most people a while to get the hang of it.<br />Guy Ritchie did it all here.  I have since seen \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\" and enjoy it as well.  If I had to take one with me, I guess this would be the one.  It just has a bit more.  The irony is the main aspect in \\"Snatch,\\" just as it was in \\"Lock Stock.\\"  I feel that the characters made this a better film of the two.<br />I'm guessing that most people will like this film.  Give it a shot if you haven't.  If you do rent it or buy it and don't fully get it the first time, give it another go.  There are so many things going on in this movie that you need to see it a couple of times to pick them all up.
B00005KHJT|5.0|This is the best horror movie ever and is also the best in the Halloween series. This DVD contains 4 extra scenes that were shot for television when the movie was sold to NBC. It would be neccasary to fill the 2-hour time block. The four extra scenes are are a total of twelve minutes. I have seen this movie at least twenty times, and it still scares the living daylights out of me. John Carpenter is just the right director to do the film. Debra Hill and John did a great job at writing the script and making the plot simple: On Halloween night 1963, 6-year-old Michael Myers stabbed his sister to death. 15 years later he escaped from the mental hospital to go after his sister, Laurie Strode. Only Michael's doctor, Dr. Loomis is hot on Michael's trail. I love this movie! The extra scences include; Dr. Loomis persuading two county ward workers to have Michael locked up, a seen where Dr. Loomis talks to 7-year-old Michael Myers. There is also this extra seen where two nurses show Dr. Loomis what Michael did the night he escaped. And lastly, there was a seen where Lynda came over to Laurie's house and wanted to borrow a blouse and Annie calls saying that she wants to borrow it too. It is a great movie with a great atmoshere on suspence and scary moments. The extra scenes were filmed using the crew of Halloween II. The scene where Dr. Loomis talked to Michael helped the filming of Halloween II. The boy who played Michael Myers was in Halloween II where Laurie had a flashback to where she went to see Michael in the sanitarium. I think that Halloween was the best horror movie that was ever made. There had been made six sequels after it, and Halloween 8 called Halloween: Homecoming is coming into theaters the summer of 2002. Halloween was made in 1978 which means the series has been lasting for 24 years. Halloween is a true masterpiece. Critics say that it is the most sucsessful independent film ever made. They are sure right! If you ever get the chance to rent the movie rent it, or even better buy it, and I would urge you to buy the television version with the extra scences. It is not gory or bloody or anything, just plain scary! This is the best horror movie ever made!t, or even better buy it, and I would urge you to buy the television version with the extra scences. It is not gory or bloody or anything, just plain scary! This is the best horror movie ever made!
B00005QXDD|2.0|I'm not sure why I broke down and bought this; maybe because I kept hearing how HILARIOUS it was. But to me, this just sounds like the Barenaked Ladies with swear words. Recommended if you are into Kid Rock, wrastlin', and Mancow. <BR>(I did give this two stars because it was great to hear Nirvana's drummer is working again.)
0375507507|5.0|Any time you hear about southern Africa's history in the U.S., you usually only hear about the repression of the native Africans and the evil colonials that supressed them. As the American-born daughter of a white Rhodesian, I am ecstactic to finally have found a novel that reveals how life was for the Europeans in Southern Africa during the years of turmoil.<br />Alexandra Fuller's attention to detail (especially to the region's dialect and the sights and smells) and sense of humor create an intensly engaging story of one white family's survival in a chaotic and intense evironment. Fuller creates a very authentic, no-apology narrative that America should appreciate as an honest glimpse of life in Africa.<br />Her frankness about her family's feelings toward the native Africans only gives her story credibility. While most Americans will consider this racism, they need to look beyond that stereotype and see that the family was simply reacting to the environment and times they were in. Overall, this novel is about the challenges the family faced and how they managed to overcome them and stay together as a family. Truly a portrait of courage.<br />If you are looking for \\"the other side of the story\\" when it comes to Southern Africa, you could not have found a better book. The sincerity and honesty of Fuller's novel are valuable assets in a world filled with stereotypes and ignorance.
B000002U9L|5.0|I love the movie Labyrinth....and why do most people love Labyrinth??? Duh....David Bowie!!! But what is the second reason people love Labyrinth??? The music!!! <BR>This is a great soundtrack, and any David Bowie, or Jim Henson fan would enjoy this CD.
0767818040|5.0|I'm not quite sure why I've always been so fascinated with this movie, but I am. The first time I ever saw it was in high school. I had read that it was a great movie and wanted to see it very badly. <br />One night I stayed up way past my bedtime just so I could see it. I think it was about 2:00am when it finally came on. Maybe part of the intrigue was that I was willing to stay up that late for a movie. I don't know. As it started, there was just something about it that I liked. It appears to be a bad film in the beginning, but once the houses, cars, plot, characters, and music develope, it becomes something more. <br />I've seen most of Depalma's films and he is truly an expert of voyeurism. I don't think in High School I had ever been part of a movie like I was with Body Double. Since that night it has become my favorite movie of all-time. I have easily watched it 150 times and can basically tell you the dialog from beginning to end.<br />Jake Skully is just a normal guy trying to make it in Hollywood and gets caught up in a whirlwind of terror and sex. As he falls in love with the next door neighbor, life starts to become very mysterious to him. Why would this girl do the things she does? Why would she put up with the things she does? He can't figure her out. All the knows is that she \\"does her thing\\" every night like clockwork. Little does he know he's being set up for a ficticious role. <br />The music, the homes, the cars, the scenery, and the camera angles really make this a complete movie. The music especially. It was the first thing I ever truly remember loving about this movie. It fits the scenes to a tee. Body Double is filmed in the early 80's and with all Depalma films it has already hit a high level of noirish value. Check out Shelton's sunglasses in the movie. I still laugh when I see them.<br />Again, I'm not sure why this has always been my favorite movie, but maybe you can tell me after you see it. If you have not seen this movie yet, you should.Depalma is always compared to Hitchcock and that's fine. Who cares really? It's a great movie. We all get inspiration from somewhere.
B000059QY2|3.0|The voices are great, the relatively young Pavarotti is almost dashing in the role of the carefree Duke, and the locations are beautiful, but I came away feeling dissatisfied with the dramatic experience. Part of the problem is in the performances: Wixell somehow fails to convey Rigoletto's twisted nature, while Gruberova -- well, one can only wish she were more the physical type to justify the courtiers' cry of \\"Quant'e bella!\\" But the weakest point in the film is the staging and photography. Although locations are used, they end up feeling like stages, and many of the shots have a random feeling or are just plain clumsy  -- for instance, sudden zoom-ins on one or another of the principals. The great quartet in the last act feels fragmented as the camera jumps from one singer to another, now inside the house, now outside; and in the middle of Gilda's last intimate moments with Rigoletto, for some reason we are placed several hundred feet away from the singers in a shot that goes on for far too long. If you're looking for a great \\"movie opera\\" this is not at all in the same league as something like Zeffirelli's La Traviata. <br />The image and sound on the DVD are excellent; there are no extra features.
B00005NWM3|5.0|i liked this cd. when i was pist off or just needed some me time to rehash my day it was good. again it was one of the few cd's where i can listen to most of the songs. although i did have to skip one song it was better then having to skip all the songs and only being able to listen to two out of the whole cd. i give this a five for its ability to abuse reality without being the guilty one.
B000006OS2|5.0|I think this is extremely funny.  It still shows him as the typical John Wayne with a sense of humor.   I hadn't seen it for some years and when I saw it again I laughed as hard as I had the first time.
071198042X|4.0|A must have for Freddie fans who want to know how he was and how he lived the goods and not so goods. I liked the detail and content around people that interfaced with Freddie. It is now easy to understand why Queen were so good at what they did.<BR>The book keeps away from other Queens band members and I would have liked to know a little more about their interfaces and thoughts of Freddie. Sad butlearning end for a brilliant artist. He will live on for a long time through his music
0375507507|1.0|The problem with this book is its laden, self-pitying tone. I got no sense of the beautiful country of Zimbabwe, the beautiful natives of that great country or of the incredible, formidable liberation struggle fought in that country for close to a generation. This... book and in many instances dangerously incomplete and infactual. Fuller has atleast an obligation to the historical facts, I would think, if nothing else. Her prose also made reading this book torturous. Unless you're Toni Morrison or Thomas Pynchon then you shouldn't attempt complex metaphors else they fall flat and come of as foolish, confusing and unintentionally funny. For the more literate readers out there looking for a good book, don't believe the hype on this sensationalist mess. There are many other writers, black Zimbabwean women writers, who are writing about the same period, about the same things with more intelligence, depth, feeling, compassion and humor. I would try them first.
B00005RFAI|4.0|...the lyrics are for the most part upbeat and empowering for young women-\\"Respect\\" is great.
6305428220|5.0|Watching the preview for this movie you already start to feel hyped. This is not just another &quot;alien&quot; story. The Faculty has a lot of twists and turns that keep it going on. It is thrilling throughout after watching it tons and tons of times. It carresses a charisma and is very down to earth. Also its cast is just awesome (Josh and Elijah). I LOVED IT!
B00003CXXS|3.0|Jurassic Park III is more simply a dinosaur movie that you take the entire family to see \\"Nothing more, Nothing less!\\" I like JP3 a lot better than the much disappointing \\"Lost World: JP2\\" that only Speilberg HAD to do enorder to have Universal produce \\"Schindler's List\\". Many people felt mixed about this film and same with me ,but hey the graphics are better than the first two.<BR>This film had likable characters, a sense of humor more dinosaurs!!!!! Plot needs to be better ,but still enjoyable.
B000059WOD|5.0|Just when I thought Hyrbid Theory couldnt possibly get any better, that it was perfect as it was, I bought the Japenese import with two extra tracks- My December and High Voltage. If you love Linkin Park, these songs will blow you away. My December is slower but prettier, in fact, an incredible pretty that I didn't know Linkin Park had, and High Voltage, the powerful, perfect song to blast in your house. If you haven't bought this import yet, you are missing out on so much- namely hearing some of the best songs ever recorded in history.
6305308659|1.0|*Pleasantville* has a lot in common with the movie *Chocolat* : both tell the story of two strangers who bring colour to a black-and-white town of the late 1950s by upsetting the traditional value-system of the locals and leading them into various temptations.<br />But if *Chocolat* was a brazen attack on Catholicism, *Pleasantville* targets the «normalcy» of  suburbia in the US of the 1950s, or rather of «Pleasantville», a caricature of its portrayals in the sitcoms of the period.<br />What the movie has to say is that the people who live in Pleasantville- who either stand for the people of the 1950s, or their TV counterparts, or both, or neither- are so dumb that their books have blank pages and that if their daily routine undergoes the slightest alteration, they will be so completely befuddled as to go round and round in circles until some bright teenager from the nineties rescues them.<br />Fortunately for them, their conservatism is soon challenged by two such youngsters who introduce them to the values their decade inherited from the sixties and all the iconoclastic eras of history : abstract art, rock&#8217;n roll, women&#8217;s lib, *Catcher in the Rye*, pre-marital sex and adultery &#8211; to which, if the movie had not been so cautious not to blow its family-movie cover, might have been added tobacco, alcohol, drugs and Marilyn Manson.<br />In what is probably the most depraved scene in the whole movie, a mother is taught about the existence of «sex» by a girl she believes to be her own daughter (who introduces her speech by the hypocritical modern bromide «when you really love someone...», even though she is currently having casual sex with a boy she is physically attracted to but has nothing but scorn for) and told that she can experience it on her own. We are later led to understand that her «daughter» has given her instructions on how to «please herself», to use the fashionable euphemism, when she applies them in her bath and the intensityof her experience sets a tree on fire.<br />Now the loss of innocence in this black-and-white town never goes unnoticed, for all those who bite into the apple suddenly acquire colour (suggesting, inevitably, a flourishing into something better, with colour representing the character&#8217;s buried passions and instincts, healthily given free reign), so that soon war breaks out between the inquisitorial black-and-white forces of reaction (standing for Republicanism, McCarthyism and the religious right) and the persecuted «coloured people», a bunch of enlightened liberals who just seek the freedom to «express themselves».<br />And if you wonder what the cryptic last scene may mean, here is my interpretation : on a purely dramatic level, the screenwriter simply could not make up his mind about the mother&#8217;s affair, and whether she would leave her husband after cheating on him or not, so he simply chose to have her do both. From a philosophical  point of view, this scene represents the logical outcome of the emancipation from all constraints preached by the film : even though the inhabitants of Pleasantville have gotten rid of the laws of (« bourgeois ») morality, they are still subject to the ultimate obstacle to whim-worship, the law of identity, which says that what is A cannot be non-A at the same time and in the same respect. In the last scene of the film, this law is simply transcended, so that the mother can both be cheating on her husband (and enjoy the pleasures of adultery) and not be cheating on her husband (and still be an irreproachably faithful wife.) More colloquially, she can have her cake and eat it too, as can the screenwriter.<br />*Pleasantville* is a big thank you to the sixties for saving us from the fifties, and to Satan for giving us the guts to stand up to God, experience evil and leave His mindless Garden of Eden.<br />Interestingly, the Office for Film & Broadcasting, calling « its depiction of the repressed 1950s vs. the supposedly enlightened 1990s ... simplistic at best », gave it an A-IV rating (« Adults, with reservations ».)
B00005QDW5|4.0|Pink Floyd has always been a band that has not ever been easily defined or contained, as is proof by this new compilation. The compilers of this package have attempted the impossible to compact the 36 year history of one of rock's most innovative bands into a 2-CD set. They almost succeeded. Hardcore Floyd fans will no doubt be annoyed by what's not included(&quot;Careful With That Axe Eugene&quot; from Ummagumma, &quot;Dogs&quot; from &quot;Animals&quot;, editing the title track down from its original 22-minute length, &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; from &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; from &quot;The Wall&quot;, and several others), but then again Pink Floyd has never been defined by hit singles. Their music is always best heard in the context of a complete album. On the plus side, the remastered sound through out is excellent, and is especially noticable on the Syd Barrett tracks. For someone new to their music this is an excellent introduction.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|Stars &amp; Topsoil is definitely an excellent buy. It contains the best in the CT history. I purchased this along with Bethany Curve's latest record at the same time and it was a double treat. Both records get my highest praises for best in shoegazing.
B00000GUZP|5.0|This recording of songs by Deborah Harry of the group Blondie is one of the most influential of all the early 80's albums. Considering the songs don't gel, the album cover is disturbing to a certain degree, and that R&amp;B/Rock/PopRap did not exist at the time this record was made (Except for Blondies' &quot;Rapture&quot; which was released in 80). This album mixes genres that don't show up in the rock record until Madonna breaks out around 1983. If you want to listen to a CD by Deborah Harry that doesn't confuse you then get a greatest hits CD of her songs. But if you want to know why Sire picked the producers of this album to make Madonna famous then listen to Deborah Harrys' Koo Koo.
0714834491|5.0|The Art of Looking Sideways is an instruction manual of sorts for adults to deconstruct their preconceived belief systems of reality. Readers are encouraged to look, see, explore, turn upside down, rip apart, and to ultimately rebuild that which everyday people believe to be true through a series of word plays, found quotations, paradoxes, and unusual truths. There are no answers. Just questions, and differences of perception.<br />The book challenges, enlightens, entertains, and ultimately inspires. It's absolutely not a book of gee-whiz optical illusions, a la psychedelic &quot;Mind's Eye&quot; pointillism or perception bending Escher, but rather a playful, witty scrapbook of collected thoughts, newsprint clippings, poetry, photographs, illustrations, and assorted junk found on globe trotting vacations by the book's compiler.<br />The design of the book itself is a work of art. No two pages are the same. Each idea, or question, is presented with it's own lyrical typeface and placement to further convey the essence of the topic at hand. At my count, there are well over 1,000 different original works of typography and layout -- a stunning feat in and of itself.<br />&quot;Sideways&quot; is quite simply a fringe experience that is impossible to label, describe, or place in a particular section of a bookstore. As a designer, I felt more inspired, more aware, more energized after just a handful of pages than I can remember feeling in years of buying design and art related books. <br />It's big, heavy, and worth its weight in gold. A classic.
B000001A9P|5.0|Anyone who has never had the experience of seeing Stevie Wonder live in concert, this excellent and very underrated album is the next best thing. Fortunately I did have that rare experience back in 1995 on Martin Luther King Day(got to meet him after the show too!!!) at the Paramount Theater in Oakland, CA. The music on this 2-CD set is presented almost in the exact same sequence as the show I got to see. Stevie is backed by his awesome band Wonderlove and augmented with a large string section who compliments the band brilliantly on \\"Overjoyed\\", \\"Village Ghettoland\\", and show opener \\"Dancing To The Rhythm\\". Stevie is in fine form and voice throughout. One track that I was slightly disappointed wasn't included was \\"Maybe Your Baby\\" that climaxes with a call and response between Wonder and the audience that raised the roof off of the house!!! The majority of his best known songs are on \\"Natural Wonder\\" and the program is lively from start to finish. Hearing this album brings back that amazing night everytime I play it.
B000021Y77|5.0|I just watched this film on IFC and I can't believe it!  The whole thing is just brilliant.  I rarely review films because I love them so much I usually have too much to say about this or that, but I will try to keep it to a minimum:<br />The concept is is one people have seen before:  someone is in trouble, and the main character needs to save them.  However, this is the best, and I mean the best interpretation of the concept I have ever seen.<br />The direction is excellent.  Everything is paced the way you want the film paced without even knowing in a conscious way that's the way it should be.  In essence, the film is intuitively guided.<br />Editing is incredible in this film.  The best I have seen for a long time, and reminicient without being repetitive of films by Guy Ritchie and Quentin Terantino.<br />Acting is marvelous here.  Franka Potente not only captures amazing emotion, she is able to catch the viewer's imagination.<br />The music is really wonderful, complimenting the movie without being intrusive.<br />If you have read this far, I want to tell you two more things.  1)This is really the best film I have seen in quite a while.  2)I can't remember the last time I had this kind of fun watching a film.
B00004Y635|5.0|I first rented the movie when I was 10 yrs old.Now<BR>im 14 and I have seen it 5 times!<BR>I think anyone who loves horror movies and anyone who<BR>is a Courtney Cox fan should see this movie!
0783231202|1.0|This is a film about a true life incident. Some slaves on route to Cuba mutinied and took control of their ship. They attempted to force the surviving crew to take them to Africa but instead the captain of the ship directed it north and it was captured by the Americans. <br />This then led to a complicated debate about what should happen. Under existing law it was clear that if the slaves were from Africa then the taking of them as slaves amounted to kidnapping. They were entitled to kill the people in the ship and to escape. If on the other hand they were slaves from Cuba their actions would amount to murder. <br />The various court cases were however not about these issues. What they were about was procedural matters of whether the \\"slaves\\" should be returned to Cuba for a trial run in a kangaroo court or whether they should not...<br />The critical thing of course is that the trials were not concerned about slavery at all. Slavery was a given, the question for the various courts was simply were these men slaves or were they free men wrongly reduced to servitude and further if so what court should make the decision. <br />Instead the film tries to make this film an epic which somehow showed that America was for slaves. Hopkins makes a number of moving speeches on this theme but the reality is that it is all nonsense. This incident had nothing at all to do with the move to abolish slavery in the United States. <br />The film also is obnoxious as it relegates the Africans at the centre of the action to playing the role of dumb oxes who are saved by intrepid white characters. <br />If these ideological problems don't cause you any problems the film is a reasonably well executed florid melodrama.
B000021Y74|5.0|This film was simply amazing. The suspense is both surreal and totally real. The techno soundtrack is a seemless part of the story. Lola is both sexy and liberating. A truely stunning german film.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is the freshest music to come out in a long time; just a guy with a great voice singing to wonderful guitar riffs. There isn't a bad track on the CD, but the stand-outs are No Such Thing, 83, Neon, 3 by 5, and City Love. His voice is a little bit of Dave, Seal, and Sting all rolled into one, yet it's still individual. By the time \\"No Such Thing\\" gets to the ending chorus where he sings, \\"I can't wait for my 10-year reunion, I'm gonna bust through the double doors,\\" I was cheering. The words rung so true. And that was only the first track! Put the top down, crank it up, and start singin'.

0380713802|4.0|When Bill Bryson was in his twenties he went on a trip to Europe. It was for him a liberating experiance despite spending his time with a friend called Katz. <br />This book is about another trip that he goes on through Europe after he has worked in England for some years as a journalist. He starts of in Norway and travels through Europe to Istanbul. <br />Bryson is partially a travel writer, partially a story teller. His books are largely a starting point to have a talk. That can be about his childhood, his German teacher or his belief in the arrogance of French people. This book is actually a laugh out loud type of book. I first read it some years ago, but on re-reading it recently the jokes were just as funny and one actually breaks into laughter reading it. <br />The book is short and can be read quickly but it is worth every penny you pay for it.
B00005RZV4|5.0|No if's and's or but's...THIS is the best album of the year and it's only January. Trent Reznor never fails to give his fans what they want.

Cover your nuts because this album will kick them right up your joxie, mates!<br />Buy it. Don't ask any questions.  Capisce'?
B00000613T|5.0|Like a miner, Boulez finds the Inner symphony, the one hanging on inside lines, and leads Mahler to new light -and he lets the horns ride like sultans in the Andante!  It's an amazing reading.  Boulez' motive is so enlightened by care and love, his Mahler really comes like nothing else before it.  I say no matter your experience with Mahler, listen to these recordings of the Symphonies by Boulez - even the CSO seems to extend itself.  What a clement musician Boulez is!  He sets those opening chords to splash and be plain until almost a kind of humming seems achieved, so indifferent is he to everything but the most transparent witnessing of the score.  It's an extraordinary idea.  This is musicianship to admire forever, courageous and operating in high country in these Mahler recordings.  The last movement here is as harrowing as the first is emotional!  And the DG sonics are part of the wonderful story!  Get this recording!  After the experience, you'll seek no other Mahler 9 for some long time.
B00000IQW3|4.0|This apparently was a reasonably low budget science fiction film from 1984. Its budget may have been small but it does not have the look or feel of a low budget movie. The premise and structure of the film is also interesting. <br />The plot device is that a decent but broke kid is growing up in a trailor park. He dreams the dream of such kids but is surrounded by poverty. This however does not seem to affect him at all, he emerges as someone free of the complexs that this can sometimes cause. <br />By mistake a video game has been installed in the trailor park. This game is actually not meant to be so much a game, but a means by which an alien civilisation can recruit army personell of a certain level of talent. This game was meant to have been dropped into a bigger town but is placed in the trailer park by mistake. The hero shows his talent and is recruited to a distant war in another solar system. <br />In the end he saves the world but there is also a complicated sub plot about what happens at home while he is away. <br />An unrelentingly nice and pleasant film which was a surprise hit when released.
B000059ZLH|4.0|Metropolis 2000 put plain and simple, it rocks.  <BR>Back with a new keyboard player- Jordan Rudess, the Theater is progressive rock once again.  This has to be their best since the video 'Music in Progress' from the 'Images and Words' tour in 92/93'. Rudess returns to the progessive keyboarding roots previously enjoyed by Dream Theater fans in the days of Kevin Moore.  I'm glad to say that I thoughly enjoyed this performance and it is a must for DT fans.
6305311463|4.0|Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) is the man. All go, no quiet is his moto and he always pushes his men too hard. He's in control of a drilling station in the China Sea, hating the Greenpeace campaigns and always yelling to everyone except his best friend, Chick Chappele (Will Patton). That's his life, but all it's about to change when a meteor shower starts to fall to Earth. And this is only a warning of a major meteor to come, as big as Texas, and it will impact on the Pacific Ocean in about 18 days if NASA can't do anything about it.<br />But NASA has a plan: to launch a couple of shuttles with competent people on board to drill deep enough to set up a nuclear device that will split the rock in two. Fate? Harry Stamper and his crew are to be send. What comes next is pure joy! Especially the training and my favorite character: the russian cosmonaut, Lev Andropov (Peter Stormare).<br />A very well written story with maybe a ridiculous but yet, fun premise: Country rednecks in outer space, Bruckheimer style. By the way, the score composed by Trevor Rabin is outstanding!
B00003CXXP|5.0|I'm very glad this movie finally came out in DVD format. Ever since I saw it with my wife I've been yearning to add it to my collection - very small - of DVD movies I felt worth keeping. This movie addresses a fundamental question we all ask and seek to answer in many different ways. I personally could not help seeing the similarity between the boy's search for the Blue Fairy and the pursuit of some men and women after their creator for the answers that will give their lives meaning, and to remain alongside that which gives meaning.  For the thinker and the searcher-there is no other I could recommend this movie to.
B00005QCYC|4.0|What's wrong with some people? I mean, it seems that power and money tends to make people believe they're gods or something. That's the case in Jurassic Park, where a powerful genetic industry, known as InGen creates living dinosaurs in order to open the ultimate zoo, somewhere near Costa Rica.<br />And that's how we meet the two main characters of this series, serious Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paranoid and funny Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). They're both guests to the opening of the park, but as the chaos theory goes, everything goes south. The dinosaurs escape from the confined zones and now we have all hell broke lose. I am sorry to say that The Lost World is not up to the quality of the first Jurassic film, but it still has good moments and what can I say about JP3? I think it's best of all three movies.<br />This is pure entertainment and it starts with a very and plausible premise. It's just a sci-fi adventure, but a sci-fi adventure like this don't come very often. The two characters are very well written and once you see this, you'll never forget Sam Neill wearing his hat and Jeff Goldblum dressed in black. And I think that's a great thing to say about these films, because those 2 characters stay with you long after you saw the movies... not even the dinosaurs. Human touch, I guess.

B00005YTFG|5.0|I watched this movie expecting that it would be a boring musical but instead I was so moved and so felt the meaning of love. The love that that is shared in this movie is magical, words could not even start to explain. I never cry in movies but I couldn't stop crying. You could feel their pain, their joy, their troubles and most of all their love for each other. It is a classical love movie but didn't feel like one. It had revenge, hatred everything that makes a movie GREAT! I am not saying that everyone will love this movie. But I loved it, and everyone I know loved it. It you want a romantic movie this movie is the movie is for you. Going to watch this movie I was saying how love sucked and that is was not worth the trouble, After the movie I couldn't help but love, love.
B000001GXI|3.0|Oh where shall I start? This performance has certain really good points, and some that are just plain horrible. It really comes down to a game of boys vs. girls, and believe me, the boys whipped those girls into oblivion.<br />It's really a shame that a performance can have such wonderful forces like Fritz Wunderlich, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Franz Crass (all three of whom are considered by many to be the greatest interpreters of these parts ever), and yet the consistency is broken by poor performances by the strained squeals of Evelyn Lear's Pamina and the entirely bland and uninvolved Queen of Roberta Peters. The three ladies aren't that great either.<br />Roberta Peters' delivery of \\"Der Holle Rache\\" is kind of a joke. If you are familiar with Steven Wright, imagine casting him as the Queen of the Night (well, give him a swift quick between the legs first). Yeah, that's about it. Peters actually sounds bored in her delivery of her two arias. However, her voice and technique are good for the most part (with the exception of some rather breathy F's). <br />Evelyn Lear, on the other hand, is very musical and expressive, but sounds like a dying cat. The sounds of her high range remind me of that time I stubbed my toe on a pile of rusty nails. What a shame.<br />And you know what the worst part is? This performance would have been perfect if some better sopranos were cast. Wunderlich can be relied upon to emit beautiful sounds and absolutely heartbreaking expression. Fischer-Dieskau's acting (which is the central part of Papageno's character) is wonderful--proving that he is indeed one of the greatest baritones in recent memory. And of course Franz Crass's classic interpretation of Sarastro. If I had my way, I would superimpose sopranos such as Edda Moser and Sumi Jo into this recording, and then it would indeed be perfect.<br />But until then, my advice is to buy this recording for half of the arias, and buy another recording for the other half. That would be cool.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Mule Variations is another flawless cd by a master of words.  Tom Waits tells the stories of the kind of people most try to forget exists and gives them a human face unlike any other singer/songwriter.  Every song on this one is great but my personal favorite is &quot;Hold On&quot;.  I listen to that one whenever I feel life and people getting me down.  Its a great song.<br />Waits sings and writes about real people.  These are the kind you see at bus stations, walking across the highway or hanging out at noon in your local bars.  He tells it like no other, understanding what makes them tick and putting it in his soulful amazing voice.<br />Brilliant!
B000002UDD|3.0|I heard this album the first time in 1988 when a friend let me borrow the tape during study hall.  At the time my knowledge of heavy metal was extremely limited.  The only two metal bands I listened to were Anthrax (whom I still enjoy) and Metallica (whom I wish would either break up or return to the underground - like that's gonna happen).  I was very impressed by the bunker-buster guitar riffs, the jaw-dropping guitar solos, the out of nowhere tempo changes, and the evil lyrics.<br />Well, times have changed.  In the 13 years since my tastes, especially in metal, have broadened and improved significantly.  SFSGSW is still a technically impressive album.  Even though the technicality is no match for a group like Dream Theater or Spiral Architect, you have to consider the album came out in 1988.  Only a handful of bands like Metallica and Watchtower were putting out stuff with this degree of musicianship.<br />But unlike the albums from Dream Theater or Metallica, SFSGSW lacks a crucial ingredient: song quality.  \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" had all the potential in the world to being a great instrumental, yet it seemed to end when the band - or rather Dave - got bored with it.  Is it any wonder why you never hear this instrumental mentioned in the same sentence with Metallica's \\"Orion\\" or Edgar Winter's \\"Frankenstein\\"?  \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" is a tepid remake that should have been left alone.  It is almost as bad as their 1986 version of \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\".  \\"Mary Jane\\" and \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" are otherwise great songs that are marred by Dave's efforts to (GASP!) sing.  Mustaine is a good lyricist, a great guitarist, and an exceptional composer; but he sure as heck ain't no singer.  \\"502\\" is well... filler at best.  \\"Hook and Mouth\\" has to be one of the worst sung songs ever in the vast realm of metal.  However, the biggest affront of them all is \\"Liar\\".  It is little more than a mean-spirited, hypocritical diatribe against former Megadave guitarist Chris Poland, who was reportedly fired for pawning the band's equipment in order to buy drugs.  You'd have thought that being fired from Metallica for substance abuse reasons would have humbled Mustaine.  Think again.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are some shining moments on SFSGSW.  The guitar solos and riffs by Mustaine and Jeff Young kick major hindquarters.  Chuck Behler lays down some solid drumming that compliments David Ellefson's flawless basslines.  It is a shame to see that these gifted musicians were hampered by their immaturity and lack of chemistry.  And there is one perfect song on the album: \\"Set the World Afire.\\"  It ranks right up there with Metallica's \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" and Black Sabbath's \\"Electric Funeral\\" as great nuclear war anthems.  If as much effort were placed into the rest of SFSGSW, we may have been left with another Reign in Blood, Among the Living, or maybe even another Master of Puppets in terms of greatness.  But it's SFSGSW.  And we're stuck with it.<br />Overall rating: 2.75 stars.nd, who was reportedly fired for pawning the band's equipment in order to buy drugs.

0790738139|5.0|L.A. Confidential was a brilliant film. The acting was very good and the plot kept your interest peaked. The changes in the relationsonships of the characters progessed smoothly and the various comic lines were added well. L.A. Confidential is a perfect movie of you like mystery and drama. Although Kevin Spacey is mentioned first in credits Russell Crowe deserves more notice for his leading role at which he does an amazing job portraying. Kim Basinger who was much noted for her character, which is preformed well, but not quite as award worthy as commonly said. Guy Pearce makes in affective change from the obnoxious snitch to a likable cop. Kevin Spacey's character is refreshingly funny as well as moving in the changes he makes on himself, by starting to understand what he has become. The various twists in the plot keep your mind roling and your curiousity present. Altoghether L.A. Confidential is the paragon of a great film.
B00003CXE7|2.0|More recently, the critics took aim and fired collectively at Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.  One of the criticisms was the film's (alleged) lack of attention to historical fact.   Indeed, Michael Bay took some liberties with Pearl Harbor.  He altered history.   <br />With Gladiator, history was not altered, but put through a  paper shredder and completely re-written.   Early in the film, the audience is asked to go along with the most ludicrous of propositions.  It goes like this. <br />Caesar, (played by Richard Harris) is weary of war and conquest.  He would like to die knowing that Rome will be reformed.   Thus, he makes known his desire to make Marcus Aurelius, (played by Russell Crowe) the new Emperor.   He would rather have a soldier be Emporer than his own son.  Why?  Because he wants to give power \\"back to the people.\\"  <br />Anyone who knows anything about Roman history ought to be ashamed for swallowing this whopper.   The real Caesar didn't give a rat's behind about giving power to the people.  One has to get past this ludicrous idea from the get go, or spend the rest of the movie scratching his head. <br />And the battle scenes?     Well they  are so obviously computer animated,  I felt l as though I was watching  Rogger Rabbit vs. Ben Hur.  <br />And what's more, the basic plot seems stolen straight from the Mad Max movies and placed in an Acient Roman setting.   The hero's family is murdered, and so our hero must rise up against seemingly unstoppable forces to get revenge.  Sound familiar? <br />I can agree that Russell Crowe is a fine actor, as are the other players in this film.  But I don't understand how that  excuses all of the other flaws.  <br />Even still, lots of folks out there liked it, so I guess its just a matter of taste.   Check it out, but be ready to seriously suspend your disbelief.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, is a wonderful book about the trials and tribulations of a teenage boy named Charlie who is in the 9th grade.  Charlie writes the book in letterform.  We do not know where Charlie lives, or to whom he is writing his letters to.  What we do know is that he must deal with real life situations; such as drugs, love and relationships, family problems, sexuality, how to make friends, and his best friend's recent suicide.  Charlie is not an outgoing person, nor is he unpopular. He's somewhere in-between.  In these letters he tells about his whole life, including his feelings, thoughts and every thing that has occurred to him.  In order to get well again, he is forced to face the death of his best friend as well as the previous events of his aunt's tragic life and death.   Helping him through these times is his English teacher, Bill, who understands that Charlie is very smart, and his two loyal friends, Sam and Patrick.  But even with the help of these people, depression still overcomes him and he is hospitalized.  The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great choice for all teenagers and adults to read.  It explains how many outcast high schoolers feel and function in their real lives.  Teenagers like Charlie are filled with doubts and worries that are just as complicated as the problems adults face every day.
0783240236|5.0|I'm not one for scary movies, and I kept picking this one up in the video store and putting it down.  Finally, I just decided to walk into the video store, pick it up, and go straight to the register.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This is such a great movie!  It's suspenseful and funny at parts... and scary too!  Not too scary though that it frightens you.  There was parts where I was yelling at the charecters in the movie to not do something because you were sure that they were going to get attacked.  It's a great movie that I really enjoyed, and I sure am glad that I rented it.  The extra features are really neat too: reading the alternate ending and reading about a deleted scene, though reading about the deleted scene was a bit confusing because you weren't really sure where it was supposed to be.  The documentry was very neat also... I seriously enjoyed this movie and I see why people like it so much.  It's just a really really great movie!!!  It's one movie that you've just gotta see!  It's wonderful!!!!
B00005QK3W|3.0|That's the way I felt listening to Mac's &quot;Driving Rain&quot;.  The first time I listened, it was &quot;good&quot;, then &quot;O.K.&quot;, then, &quot;very good&quot;.  By about the 15th listen, I just &quot;didn't know&quot;!<br />I still enjoy the cut: &quot;Magic&quot;.  Mabe because it was written about Linda and Paul's first meeting each other.<br />I'm sad to agree &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; was in fact, a stronger album.  In that respect, I think &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is a bit of a drag.  I've come to expect the un-expected from Paul.  As of late, you can pretty much predict what he's going to do - track to track -. That's a bit sad.<br />Before I close... it me, or do I detect Paul's voice fading/cracking a bit!?  It just does not seem as strong as it was just a short time ago!<br />Anyway, if you're a diehard McCartney Fan, this CD is worth at least 15 spins!  :)
0871137380|5.0|This is a riveting book that makes you feel as if you were there on the scene, and very happy that you are actually safe at home. Bowden is able to take the point of view of all parties. That's because he interviewed hundreds of people in apparently minute detail. It is a great work of scholarship, really, even though the first impression is that he is kind of a military jock, groupie. I was amazed at how little I knew about this significant event, and at the planning, logistical and expectation disconnects that led to a very messed up situation.
B00005OWIU|4.0|...Williams did an excellent job with less than serious material to work with.  But the difference between Sullivan and Williams is that Sullivan could only write excellent, original material with less than serious material, where Williams writes his best material with serious movies. I am a great fan of Williams, and have many of his scores and I particularly enjoy the more serious ones like &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; over &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Home Alone&quot;.  It is a great stand alone score, but doesn't have the emotional weight (nor should it) of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; or the greatest Williams, &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, but it has the trademark Williams catchyness and shows Williams ability to catch the mood of the movie.  I applaud Williams for his wonderful work but hope to see the next movie he works on with the emotion to put his full talent to work.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|What a waste of film.  A total waste of time to watch.  No entertaining at all.  There is no plot and there is no story to follow.

0871137380|5.0|This is the story of Army Rangers. I went through Ranger Training. It was gruelling and character building. If not for that training, probably NO ONE would have made it that day in Somalia. That's why I have a problem with liberals who kind of pooh-pooh our training, from a distance, naturally. \\"Why should the USA be involved with anything that would require grunts with that kind of training\\", they ask? They just don't get it. I don't bother explaining. I just tell them to read the book, \\"West Point\\" by Norman Remick to get all the philosophical explanations on why our founding fathers decided America needed schools (thus, the name of the book) to train the military in courage, character, and leadership, the ultimate of which is Ranger School. Those Islamic fundamentalists might do well to read it, also, to understand what America is REALLY all about. Maybe they'd see the light. But, fact is, we're in a new kind of war. I guess the 20% of Americans in the polls who don't support our war on terrorists think we should all convert to Islam to remove the threat to American men, women, and children? No way. We have Rangers to stand up and defend America and our principles. To Somalia, I say, \\"we shall return\\"! And, to those other Countries who talk out of both sides of their mouths while supporting terrorists, I only have this to say. Get ready. We're coming!

Victa Salva has produced a very good scary movie, it's Characters are beleivable.  Well the truck driving demon is terrific!! I guess there are moments during the film that sure shock you, it.s all like a surrealistic nightmare.moments of \\"Dual\\" and \\"Texas Chain Saw Massacre\\" come to mind, this is all of them, well done to all, a refreshing change from the usual rubbish that fills our movie screens. Go see it Or Rent it.
0446608955|4.0|Mandy Moore was my first reason i had read this book, i saw the promos for the movie, and knew there was a book. So at 8:00pm on Thursday the 24th of January 2002, i got into my car and drove to the local bookstore. I started reading it right there, i read for 2 hours until the store closed at 10pm. I got through 9 of the 13 chapters. The wrong thing was that i stopped reading, until the next day. It gave me a lot of time to think about what the last 4 chapters were about. It turned out to be predictable, a few things gave it away. So in my opinion it should be read all at one time. Finding out how the story unfolds is the main reason to keep reading. As a guy i liked this book, no doubt. The vocabulary in the book was around 8th or 9th grade, but the simplicity is quite good (written probably for that age group) At first i was smiling a bit, but by the end it did make you sad. I could relate to it at that date thats why it was so appealing. For others it might be more.
B00000K0E5|4.0|James Bond was getting a little tired in the Eighties, and it was definitely beginning to show. However, Bond is back in Goldeneye, \\"new and improved\\" for the Nineties. The story is the same, of course, with a villain set on world domination whom Bond must defeat with the help of a dazzling woman. <br />Pierce Brosnan is definitely the best Bond after Sean Connery (and in a few ways, perhaps better) - he's suave, debonaire, and looks stunning in a tux. The villain, played adroitly by the British Sean Bean, is also a welcome change: this bad guy's an ex-best-friend of Bond's, who's going to use the INTERNET to dominate the world! The women are a treat as well, especially Famke Janssen as the *very bad* villainess.<br />All in all, though \\"die-hard\\" fans of James Bond may disapprove of some of the newer elements (James Bond has a lady boss, who calls him a \\"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\\" - fancy that!), if one can look past the updating for the new century, it's still a very enjoyable romp. And it's still far better than a Licence to Kill.
B00005JKT8|2.0|In itself, there's a sense of the romantic in the notion of time travel; and when you introduce the idea of two people traveling through time to find one another-- when you factor in love-- it puts the romance in the romantic.  It's quite a concept, and it's the basis of director James Mangold's \\"Kate and Leopold,\\" starring Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman, a film that asks the audience to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow.  In other words, don't look too deep into this one; if you can do that, you may have a good time with this film, but bear in mind you're going to have to meet it at least half-way for it to be what it was meant to be:  Pure entertainment; no more, no less.<br /> It's New York, 1876; the Brooklyn Bridge (which ultimately figures prominently in the plot) is being built, and though John Roebling's \\"erection\\" (as it is referred to) is of great interest to Leopold Mountbatten (Jackman), Duke of Albany, there are more pressing matters in his life.  His Uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) is insisting that Leopold choose a bride from amongst the most rich and available of society, and has arranged for a ball to be held at his mansion, at which time his nephew will announce the name of the lucky lady.  At the ball, however, a stranger catches Leopold's eye, who-- when he notices he is being watched-- bolts from the premises with Leopold in pursuit.  The chase takes them to the bridge, whereupon something inexplicable happens, and Leopold suddenly finds himself in New York, 2001, in the apartment of the man he had been chasing, Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber).  Things happen fairly rapidly after that, and very quickly Leopold meets Stuart's ex-girlfriend (who lives upstairs), Kate McKay (Ryan).  And then the real story begins as, not surprisingly (refer to title of film here), Kate and Leopold discover that there may be something more to their chance meeting than just a newly founded friendship.  But there's a problem, and it's a bigone:  They happen to live in different centuries...<br /> In the final analysis, this mildly diverting, minor romantic fantasy is buoyed by the star power it employs, without which it would barely stay afloat.  Not that it's a \\"bad\\" movie, but it suffers from a decided lack of originality in both story and presentation.  Given the concept of the film, it needed an imaginative touch to really make it work, and unfortunately, Mangold was unable to provide it.  And it's a shame, because in Ryan and Jackman he had two of the main ingredients for success, but he failed to make the most of it.  Like mixing metaphors, mixing genres is a hard sell to begin with, and it's imperative that the filmmaker have a definite vision going into such an undertaking; Spike Jonze did with \\"Being John Malkovich\\" (from which this film borrows the concept, as well as the context, of the \\"time portal,\\") and was successful.  Mangold, however, failed to realize such a vision, and the moment passed him by.<br /> As the Duke, Hugh Jackman gives a convincing performance, complete with a passable British accent.  And you have to give Jackman credit for constantly striving to expand his horizons artistically; he's done science fiction (\\"X-Men\\"), romantic comedy (\\"Someone Like You\\"), action/thriller (\\"Swordfish\\") and now this, which is different still.  Also to his credit, he's done well in them all.  With such a diverse resume, he's already demonstrated his versatility and ability as an actor, and add to that the fact that he has a definite screen presence, and you know-- without a doubt-- that you're looking at a \\"star\\" who is only just beginning his ascent, the kind who will bring more than \\"celebrity\\" to whatever role he takes on.  Definitely an actor of whom we will be seeing a lot more.<br /> Meg Ryan is a versatile actor, as well, who can do drama (she was outstanding in \\"When A Man Loves A Woman\\"), or action/drama (\\"Proof of Life\\"), but her forte is romantic comedy (\\"Sleepless In Seattle,\\" \\"You've Got Mail\\").  As Kate, however, she gets caught up in her character with the same misdirection that characterizes this entire film.  On one hand, Kate is sweet and perky (traits upon which Ryan has successfully capitalized elsewhere), but there is also a more jaded side to Kate, the businesswoman striving to get ahead (More like Diane Keaton's J.C. in \\"Baby Boom\\"), and these two sides of Kate's personality, rather than making her a complex character, simply do not seem to gel, and at times the demands of the way in which the character is written takes it's toll on credibility; and in a story like this, the one thing you absolutely need is believable characters, people you can accept as presented.  And there are too many moments in which the side Ryan is attempting to convey seems forced.  I hasten to add that it is not entirely her fault; the character is poorly written, and Mangold did not serve his star well.  It goes back to the vision of the director.  A Nora Ephron, for example, knows how to get the best out of someone like Ryan, whereas Mangold simply does not.<br /> Turning in notable performances in supporting roles are Liev Schreiber, another gifted actor who has yet to have his day in the spotlight (he has one of the best voices in the business, so effective in his terrific portrayal of Orson Welles in \\"RKO 281\\"); and Breckin Meyer, convincing as Kate's actor brother, Charlie.<br /> The supporting cast includes Natasha Lyonne (Darci), Bradley Whitford (J.J.), and Philip Bosco (Otis).  The anticipation for this film was high, but ambiguous direction and lack of definition causes \\"Kate and Leopold\\" to misfire at just about every turn.  Ryan, Jackman, Schreiber and Meyer deserve better than this, and so does the audience.  The magic just isn't there.

B00005RIKD|5.0|Having been a Sting fan for many years; I am still amazed at how little his creativity is mostly un-appreciated. For an artist to have the ability to steal our imaginations, and dreams, and turn them into songs is mind boggling. \\"All This Time\\" speaks volumnes in this area. I wish that more musicians would re-visit their older recordings. Props to Sting for speaking to my soul through his artistry. \\"Fragile\\", is one of the greatest songs ever written.

B000000OR9|5.0|WHAT A DISC! John Sykes, from Tygers of Pan Tang and Whitesnake, steps out to front his own band and man can this guy sing! We already knew he could play guitar with the best, but here he shows us what he can do with his voice. Impressive! The band is rounded out with Carmen Appice, drums, and Tony Franklin, bass. Appice, we all know is a great drummer, but Franklin is a find as bassist, as well. In the studio, keyboards were played by Nik Green.<br />Blue Murder is a full assault of the Rock 'N Roll variety. The music sounds a little like newer Sabbath with Geoff Nichols, but this isn't a copy at all. These songs all have good lyrics and great music. Sykes has remarkable solos on this CD, but we all knew he had it in him from other CDs. This disc cuts loose like gang busters from begining to end. There are no songs you'll want to pass over when you listen to this. Really great songs include \\"Riot\\", \\"Sexchild\\", \\"Blue Murder\\" and \\"Billy\\". My favorites, and we're talking HUGE are \\"Valley of the Kings\\" and \\"Black Hearted Woman\\". A definite part of any '80's/'90's hard rock collection. 3 thumbs up!
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness goes down as one of the best albums of the 1990s. Smashing pumpking transformed themselves through their careers as just another grunge band to a band of importance. Mellon Collie and the Infinite sadness is their swan song and shows what the band is capable of doing.
B00004TRD8|5.0|SUPURB!! I have always loved the film but you get so much more from this Special Edition DVD.<BR>You get the film on one disc, and it has a lot more scenes in it that had been cut out for the original release. On the other disc, you have the making of the film as well as the making of the Terminator 2 3-D at Universal Studios, which was great. I have just been to Universal Studios in Florida & T2 3-D was AMAZING! This DVD is very worth Buying.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK computer is Radiohead's best album to date. I really haven't heard anything like OK Computer before. Radiohead took a really big risk by doing an album this experimental but it worked out for the better. The album is great and helped to make radiohead's place in rock history.
0446608955|5.0|Landon Carter is now 57, but when he was 17 his life changed forever.  Jamie, the girl he had known for his whole life, but didnt think anything else of her except for a friend, became somthing more.  Landon sighed up for a drama class expecring it to be a 'blow-off' class, but what he got out of that class was somthing more.  He needed a date for the Homecoming dance, Jamie was the last girl he could think of.  Before she agreed to going she told Landon to promise he wouldent fall in love with her.  He  promised while laughing it off, never thinking anything of it.  Jamie had asked him to be the lead in the play along with her.  They rehearsed every day for weeks. Jamie and Landon grew closer and closer.  For the first time in Landons life, hes in love.  He wants nothing more then to be with her.  Jamie only has one dream in life that turns into a goal. Which is to have the biggest wedding, over flowing with people and nothing else. Landon found that strange seeing thats all she wanted. but he soon found out thats all she could have in the short time she had to live.  Jamie developed a disease, leukemia.  At this point one million things were running through Landons head, but still all he wanted was to be with her.  He decided to marry her, and have her dream come true. <BR>            Jamie and Landon are the type of cherecters that can make you laugh and cry at the same time.  Jamie seemed like the responsible, caring, and loving girl that will always be there for you. Landon was the more popular, football playing type of guy.  I liked how Nichols Sparks would show great detail in every  thing they did.  The auther also showed flash back, it was like Landon was sitting right next to you telling you about his teen years. At the begining of the book it says &quot;First you will smile, and you will cry-- don't say you havent been warned.&quot; At first i didnt understaind it, but once i got into the book it started making sence. This book has been my favorite, at times it was funny sad and very moving.
B000002LFU|5.0|Green stands as a great REM album. The album the band's first with warner brothers and it show that the band did not sell out to corporate interests. Green is still a honest REM album from start to finish.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|I can't believe it!  I had caught bits and pieces of this movie on cable, but it never caught my interest, AT ALL.  Then, one day, I happened to catch it at the beginning. That was all it took!  I was completely engrossed -- so much so, that when it came on three hours later on another channel, I found myself riveted to my seat yet again, for the entire show.  Something that's never happened to me before.<br />As someone else mentioned, this is definitely a movie to watch over and over again -- all the subtle details just can't be picked up in one viewing.  <br />Fine performances by all, including Shawn Doyle (the killer), whom I hadn't seen mentioned in the other reviews I read (of course, I didn't read all 160+ reviews!!).  <br />I can tell this will be one of those movies that I'll hound all my friends and family to watch!
B000002LOE|5.0|Out of time is a great album even after being released for more then a decade now. The album sounds great and marks the first the band uses outsiders on an album on songs like shiney happy people and radio song. This album helped to make rem for a good reason.
B00005NGZX|5.0|After Converge was done with their album, \\"When Forever Comes Crashing\\", not only did their bassist leave, but so did their drummer. Then you read about Converge choosing a producer hardly anyone's heard about to do the recording for the new album. Fans have nothing to worry about; Nate Newton fills in the duties of Brodsky finely (listen to the hypnotic groove on \\"Hell To Pay\\"). Ben Koeller is an amazing drummer; he doesn't use double bass, relying rather on his technicality and speed displayed throughout the album. And Matthew Ellard's previous recording experience includes bands like...Weezer, among others. But in no way is he trying to make Converge sound like any mainstream band. In fact, this is probably Converge's most intense and creative album to date.<br />It opens with \\"Concubine\\", starting off with innocent harmonics the first five seconds, then shifting into blistering speeds and intensity, featuring Bannon's trademark vocals, which are as scathing as ever. The song (which clocks in at 1:19) barely takes a breather before \\"Fault and Fracture\\" kicks in, which reminds me of the Dillinger Escape Plan, only harsher. The surprise track is \\"Homewrecker\\", which has the riffs and structure of some mainstream songs (Bannon's screaming eliminates any chance of radio play), and is one of Converge's most memorable songs. The other surprise is \\"Phoneix in Flight\\", a slow motion, distorted track with an incredible climax. \\"Phoenix in Flames\\", clocking in at barely half a minute, is the harshest track on the album, featuring only drums and vox. And then there's the final title track, at over 11 minutes long, ending with a crescendo of noise so intense the only thing the listener can do is just listen in stunned silence.<br />The choice of a new recorder has enhanced Converge's sound. Everything is crisper, sounding harsher than previous efforts. And the added use of theremin takes already intense songs to new levels of dynamics. My only complaints of the new album hasnothing to do with the music; the booklet is about 30 pages thick, which has lyrics, but they're nearly unreadable. And there's Bannon's artwork, but it's repetetive; it's just variations of that drawing of the girl on the front cover. But nevermind. This is probably Converge's finest album to date. Ellard said something like \\"I'm gonna make you sound like how you really should.\\" Converge has found their sound, and it's in Jane Doe.<br />(If you like this chaotic type of metal/hardcore, check out Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch, and Drowningman.)
6305165912|5.0|To start off, I have to say that this movie is wonderful.  People had been reccomending it to me for what felt like years, but I never got around to watching it.  Finally, I saw it, and I have to say that I am sorry that I waited.  Jeff Bridges was awesome as \\"The Dude,\\" and John Goodman could not have played his role better as Walter, the Viet Nam vet bowling psychopath. But there was something strange at the beginning of this movie that I wonder if anyone else might have noticed.  In the beginning, we see \\"The Dude\\" buying a few groceries, for which he pays by check.  The date on the check is September 11th.  Stranger still however is that seconds after we see the check, we see a shot of a TV screen behind the cashier which displays George Bush, the original George Bush.  The first thing that comes out of his mouth is the statement: \\"This act will not stand,\\" referring to a situation in Kuwait.  So everyone who has it run out and double check this, and anyone who doesn't buy it now and see one of the funniest, and most visually stunning movies ever.
B00003CXTG|4.0|despite all the negatives review, this movie is fully enjoyable<BR>hystorically the film stinks in the first 80 minutes which is ruined by the stupid love story <BR>if you want a movie about world warII or pearl harbor that will fill your intellectual need,this one is hopeless<BR>but if you prefer a romance film or maybe the \\"titanic\\" type, grab some popcorn ,sit tight and enjoy =)<BR>I especially like the superb specials effect during the attack so i give it 4 stars
0385505833|4.0|Grisham's new Christmas classic was written with a twinkle in his eye, a chuckle in his belly, and a dollop of Dickens satire. Our modern day Scrooge is named Krank and he's tired of nine percent of his annual adjusted gross income going to Christmas presents. That money, saved over 50 years could lead to a nest egg worth...well you see Krank's way of thinking.<br />When I started this short book, I wondered if indeed, the Kranks would go on their cruise and it would turn out to be a National Lampoon's Christmas with the Griswalds. And in some very funny ways, Grisham does not disappoint with accountant Krank displaying comic relief by his conservative nature.<br />The true irony in Grisham's tale is it shows our shortcomings, our childish ways of conformity, how even us thinking outside Stephen Covey's \\"nine dots\\" becomes a cliche. Like John Denver once penned so well, \\"as different as we are, we're still the same.\\"<br />This is a delightful read that I intend to include in my annual Christmas traditions.
B00000I14Z|5.0|Mingus Ah Um is a one of Mingus' greatest albums. It truly shows Mingus' musical genius, as a composer and bass player as well. A must have for everyone's jazz collection. A classic.
B00005214X|5.0|After receiving this recently and listening to both at home and in the car,I have to say it brought back some fond and great memories.Growing up with the Beatles and all the other great music of that era, it played a special part of life of that time.The remastered version is especially enjoyable.George must have been very pleased with the results.The haunting pics of him inside of 30 years ago and two years ago give the collection a special touch as well.Recommended very much.
B00005OAA6|5.0|Fans who like pop & RnB will definetely like this! Even though she's really overrated over in the UK this album shows that Posh can do well by herself! The ballad \\"IOU\\" is dedicated to her husband David and is one of my favorite tracks. \\"Every Part Of Me\\" is a really cute & sweet song that has vocals from her son Brooklyn, he's so adorable! Now in 10 years he'll know that his mom was DEFINETELY famous! Snatch this album and get it here from amazon ...
0312117337|5.0|I own 11 different Tarot decks.  Many of them have been my best friend.  This deck is my newest purchase and immediately upon opening them I felt the messages start to talk to me.  The art work is just beautiful.(simply stated, but an understaement)<BR>The deck is a little different than the traditional decks.  It has 23 Major arcana cards.  One is a surprise for those who buy this deck.  The court cards are marked by little arrows pointing in different positions.^&gt;&lt;v but you get the drift easy enough.<BR>The booklet has a short intro. then goes right into a commentarty of each card. At the end of the booklet there are a few layouts to help you along.  <BR>Overall it is soft and sweet on the eyes and easy to interpret.  But....as a caution to the beginner......you may need to start with a basic deck and book to get to know the art of tarot reading in general.  But if you have never read tarot befor and just use this deck it might be ok because you don't have all the other stuff to confuse you. Just let these beautiful cards speak to and with you.
B00004Z459|5.0|Well, first of all, I have to give props to LP for their 3 Grammy nods, and let us LP fans hope they win. Also, I have to say that this is not as heavy as you can get, but it is pretty heavy, and it has not a single cuss word on the whole CD! Again, props. Now for the critique. &quot;Papercut&quot; is dark, unoriginal, yet catchy. &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is an excellent song, but, again not that original. &quot;With You&quot; is quite catchy, and I love the bridge and the turntables. &quot;Points of Authority&quot; is OK. The little rap intro is nothing special, but the melody is catchy and I never skip this one. &quot;Crawling&quot; is the darkest song on the album, probably about a mental patient, although the video shows a gothic girl crying blood, but that's not the point. The point is, the screaming gets by you after the second listen and you hear the sad and spooky lyrics. &quot;Runaway&quot; is probably one of the only songs I've heard about running away, and I love it. Not the topic, but the song. &quot;By Myself&quot; has great guitar and bass, but is not anything special. &quot;In the End&quot; is THE best song on the album! Nuff said. &quot;A Place for my Head&quot; is nothing special either, but the bass during the verses is amazing, and the song is catchy. &quot;Forgotten&quot; is another spooky track, with lots of screaming, but it's all right. &quot;Cure for the Itch&quot; has no lyrics, just some speaking at the beginning and the turntables working, and a little piano chording. &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; was, at first, for me, boring and weird, but it grew on me. The drums are excellent, and this is the only real song about love on here. Overall, this CD is something you cannot miss and if you don't have it by now (and I'm sure a lot of you do, cuz it sold the third-highest number in the country. So you gotta buy it, or give it a listen at least, cuz I love it and my friends who have it do, too.
0385493622|5.0|Simon Singh has written an interesting story that unfolds in narrative style, about the solution of a timeless mathematical riddle.  Fermat was a judge in 17th century France who dabbled in mathematics.  He conjectured that the Pythagorean theorem (a squared + b squared = c squared) is never true for any other whole number power (e.g. a cubed + b cubed would never equal c cubed in any case).  Maddeningly to later mathematicians, Fermat boasted in the margin of a paper that he had the proof for his conjecture.<br />     Singh briefly reviews some history of mathematics, backtracking to Pythagorus himself and then unfolds through the ages developments in the quest for mathematical proofs.  The human face of the mathematicians adds drama--the book is essentially about real people and their intellectual pursuits, challenges and failures or successes.<br />     In the early chapters, the story is easily comprehended.  Later chapters delve a bit more into the math itself, but for the purpose of unfolding the basic story, not to teach the reader &quot;how to&quot;.<br />     The book trumpets the final success in proving Fermat's conjecture by Andrew Wiles, which was front page news at the New York Times.  That any man succeeded is truly a marvel and this account allows each of us to appreciate and share in human nature which struggles and strives for answers.
B0000028W9|4.0|Leonard Cohen is a unique Artist. He came into the game late (his first album was out when he was 34), and produced his masterpiece (1988's I'M YOUR MAN) when he was in his late 50s. This is the following album, and the songs in it are as good as any Cohen album - there just aren't enough of them.<br />Cohen opens his album with the title track, by far the best song in this collection, and one of the best Cohen tracks ever. This can stand high next to Suzanne, Bird on the Wire, Hallelujah and Tower of Song. Cohen is now the prophet, mocked and misunderstood (you don't know me from the wind/ you never did, you never will/I'm the little Jew who wrote the bible). He faces a world deformed, which he fears, but others stoopidly ammulate and create (All the little poets traying to sound like Charlie Manson). he wants safety back (even the Cold War - because 'I've seen the future, it is murder'), but he knows it can never be. In the chorus, Cohen tries to defend himself from those attacking him, as he sees through their deceptions and illusions (they are the ones who want 'Christ AND Hiroshima', and thus 'When they say repent, I wonder what they meant).<br />Following on a track as powerful as that would be impossible, but Cohen certainly comes close. Waiting for the Miracle is a strong Cohen love song, filled with the humor so evident in 'I'm Your Man' (When you're Pressed for information, that's when you've got to play it dumb/ while you're waiting, for the miracle to come).<br />I admit I fail to see why Cohen brings in BE FOR REAL, an obscure cover, it is nowhere near as powerful as Cohen's own songs. <br />CLOSING TIME is a song I'm uncomfortable with. It is probably just me, but something in it doesn't quite add up. Everytime I listen to it, I admire sone lyrics (It's once for the devil and it's once for Christ), but I never get some of the rest (Why is Cohen proud that \\"I loved you for your beauty, that doesn't make a fool of me\\", and what exactly is \\"Closing Time\\"). but the melody is good and it is a powerful energetic tune.<br />ANTHEM is a good Cohen song, probably a little better than LIGHT AS THE BREEZE.<br />DEMOCRACY I feel uncomfortable about. First, I hate the drums, which are so obvious (Military Marsh? Come'on, you could do better than that), and second, because there is an Amercan-centricism which smacks you as arrogant (and yes, I know that cohen is a Canadian). Democracy is comming to the USA from Tianaman Square? America is the home of the best and of the worst? It is there they have the machinary for change? am I the only one who finds these lyrics troubling?<br />But the melody is powerful and the songwriting is impeccable, so Democracy is a good listening.<br />ALWAYS works better than Be for real, although it is another cover. The song is probably better, and Cohen and co. treats it with endearing lightheartedness and improvisation (\\"Alright\\", Cohen says at one point, \\"if you don't want to quit, let's do it one more time\\"). In fact, one only wishes that Cohen would use some of this spirit in his concert performances which often seem over rehearsed. <br />the last song on the album is an instrumental, which is kind of needless in the works of a poet like Cohen.<br />All in all, this is another great Leonard Cohen album. cohen's lyrics, his voice and songwriting are at a peak, and this is a must have album to anyone who loves complex, intelectual and challanging Rock music.
0385495323|5.0|Another book from Simon Singh that successfully combines history and mathematics.  The Code Book delivers on its promise to tell the science of secrecy (secret messaging) from ancient times to the present.  It does so in clear, understandable prose.  The continual struggle between cryptographers (those encoding messages) and cryptoanalysts (those decoding them) engages the reader's interest and heightens intensity.  A subject worth reviewing in present times, with the threat of terrorism and war in the air.<br />The book includes some very specific mathematics, in easy to follow format.  (I love math, but am quite rusty; I found this aspect refreshing because the author assumes we're all intelligent.)  <br />I almost took off a star, however, in my rating, because of the contest at the end of the book.  About ten coded messages are given and the reader is invited to decode them and send responses to the contest address.  After reading the book, I was so enthralled with the subject, that I immediately took up the challenge, cracked the first two codes in record time and then, buoyed by this success and feeling confident, worked through the night and day on the third code--totally absorbed.  I forgot what day it was (it was Sunday and I missed church), I let my daughter fix her own meals (she's seven!)--and suddenly realized I would just have to put the book away and NEVER look at the contest puzzles again.  I didn't take off the rating star, though, because I remembered in retrospect that the book includes a story of a man who likewise was consumed by a coded message he intended to decipher.  So fair warning!! <br />Enjoy the read, enjoy the challenge of the puzzles, be prepared to deepsix your copy to return to more mundane work and life!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Expectations were high for this one - after creating 3 classic full length albums in a row, anything less than brilliant just won't cut it anymore, and Amnesiac does not disappoint.  I'm just glad it isn't the &quot;return to rock and roll&quot; everybody was predicting; as shown by this album, Kid A in fact wasn't just an excuse to sound like large mammals stomping on drum machines, but rather the artistic direction toward the avant-garde that Radiohead finally developed the guts to pursue.  It has come to the point where a typical &quot;5 guys with a guitar and some drums&quot; sound is considered a departure for the band (witness &quot;Knives Out&quot;).  Radiohead's key element is innovation.  While most of the songs aren't as &quot;out there&quot; as &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;National Anthem&quot; or &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, they're still far from straightforward.  The most successful tunes are the paranoid, pulsing &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot;, the slightly jazzy &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, the loungy &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; and the piano-drenched &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;.  The album admittedly gets a bit tedious near the end, with the instrumental &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; going nowhere, &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; sounding like it was recorded backwards, and the jazz section of &quot;Life In A Glasshouse&quot; just sounding dull and grating, much unlike the energetic, free-wheeling noisemaking of &quot;National Anthem&quot;.  The work before this trio of songs, however, is Radiohead at its best.  &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is possibly Radiohead's finest song to date, while &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; also deserves to be a Radiohead classic.  Overall, you won't be disappointed.
0736041850|5.0|If you work out regularly, this book is for you.  It shows which<br />exercises and which muscle groups you are presently missing, and<br />leads you to a more symmetrical workout.<br />After about 10 days, I have post-it notes on about 9-10 pages,<br />and some really sore spots from working the groups that I now<br />find I have been neglecting.<br />This isn't like the other weightlifting books, or &quot;regime&quot; manuals; this is one you need, and won't regret buying, and<br />it won't be gathering dust on the floor next to your workstation.
B00005LB9O|4.0|Not that I have anything against Radiohead, they're one of the best bands around, but sometimes you're just not in the mood for pretentious experimental bleeping, blipping and blooping.  For this reason, it's just so refreshing to finally hear a band that keeps their work as bare-bones as Travis does.  When you're in the mood for something that sounds &quot;nice&quot;, there isn't much that sounds &quot;nicer&quot; than Travis' songs.  The most striking feature on this album is a banjo, which is heard on the opener &quot;Sing&quot; and album standout &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot;.  The best example of how easy Travis makes the art of music-making look is &quot;Dear Diary&quot;.  No drums, just an electric guitar, a bass, 2 verses and a chorus, all in all to make the perfect 3-minute song.  Other standouts include &quot;Side&quot;, &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;, the aforementioned &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot;, and &quot;The Cage&quot;.  The single best song, in my opinion, however, is the melancholy &quot;Last Train&quot;.  It provides such a great contrast to the cheeriness of the rest of the album.  It's effective in its own right, but in the context of the album, it's simply stunning.  The only weak tunes are &quot;Sing&quot; (too much of a cheesy &quot;wave-your-hands-from-side-to-side&quot; vibe) and the predictable and trite &quot;Humpty Dumpty Love Song&quot;, which I swear steals its chord prgression from Massive Attack's &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot;.  The 10 tunes in the middle are what the Travis is really all about, though.  Just nice, simple tunes with emphasis on melody.  If you want something light and easy to listen to in your CD collection, Travis offers just that without making it too syrupy (my copy doesn't have the extra tracks, so I can't make comment on those).
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash were once touted as the only band that matters.  While this may not be true today, and it probably wasn't true then, in the late seventies they were the most innovative and provocative.  I've often called them the punk rock Beatles, except better.  Like the Beatles they branched out to entirely new sounds, but unlike the Beatles they had artistic integrity from the very beginning.  This album is arguable their best.  Each song takes on a style and life of its own (and with 19 songs that's saying a lot).  The Clash aren't content to write just one kind of song.  London Calling contains some of the greatest political songs ever as well as one of the best break up songs ever written (Train in Vain).  Comprised with such breadth of emotion these songs never get old.  You'll find a song for any mood at any moment in your life.  Perhaps that's its greatest strength.
0060955775|4.0|Paulo Coelho weaves us the story of your quintessential twenty-four year-old European woman who decides to kill herself when she realizes that her life is insignificant and that she will just keep getting older and uglier and people will betray her and her life will just go downhill. She decides to cut her losses and kill herself with an overdose of tranquilizers. She wakes up on the medical floor of a renowned and intimidating mental hospital known as Villette. Once she is conscious, Veronika is informed by doctors that she has done irreversible damage to her heart and will die within a week; this knowledge reinforced by recurrent episodes of cardiac arrest. Upon hearing this knowledge, Veronika is forced to come to terms with the numbness and oblivion with which she has lived and how she can make the most of the life she has left.<br />The book has many colorful characters and its setting in Slovenia throws in some historical intrigue. There is Zedka, a housewife undergoing insulin-shock treatments for depression over a lost love whom she misses, but doesn't really understand why. There is Eduard, a handsome young schizophrenic who unwittingly becomes the impetus for Veronika's spiritual and sexual reawakening. Lastly, there is Dr. Igor, the humorous and metaphysical head psychiatrist, who will stop at nothing and no one to complete his thesis on \\"Vitriol\\" (his name for the inner poisoning which creates insanity in his patients--or in a simpler term \\"bitterness\\". Together, these colorful characters pave a path for Veronika's recovery, culminating in a truly fabulous and suspenseful ending which can't possibly be imagined beforehand.<br />Although the translation is a bit awkward in parts, the book is very well-written. Coelho shows insight into a female character without degradation. It is a very fast read and fairly easy to understand in spite of its highly philosophical content. Hints of Coelho's own life shine through in his portrayal of a society's great disdain for artists. Humor adds an ironic twist to the story, particularly in the beginning, where Paulo Coelho himself makes an appearance in his own story. There is a richness and lightness about the topic in spite of its ominous note of death, and Coelho speaks like a modern Emerson. Veronika's cynicism contrasts perfectly with her later sense of enlightenment and rebirth.

B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is up there in the top 5 Pink Floyd albums: Animals is #1, Dark Side of the Moon is #2, Meddle is #3, Wish You Were Here #4 and The Wall #5. Meddle is not lacking in great tracks, starting off with One of These Days which showcased the great things that Roger Waters and David Gilmour could accomplish together with the bass in this song. A Pillow of Winds is a mellow interlude that lays the track for Fearless, which is a great song that belongs to be blasted in stadiums everywhere. San Tropez is a laid back tune that makes you want to reach for a tropical drink, because this is Floyd at its most laid back. Seamus is a short, but quirky song about a dog that quickly becomes infectious. Then comes Echoes, the 23 minute epic that can't be eclipsed by any other Pink Floyd masterpiece. This song brought all of the band's talents together: the lead guitar role and vocals of David Gilmour, the thumping bass of Roger Waters along with the soulful lyrics, the brilliant piano and synthesizer work along with harrowing vocals by Rick Wright and the not missing a beat drum work of Nick Mason. This album makes me wish for the days when Rock music actually meant something as opposed to today, where its all about being on TRL. Also, this album deserves more airplay on the radio, but yet it remains untouched by these DJS who insist on playing the same old stuff
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album is, without a doubt, the best yet! I will admit that when I heard Britney would be changing styles, I was nervous, and maybe even a bit skeptical. But I can't believe I ever doubted her! \\"Britney\\" perfectly embodies the style of music she is meant to sing and her voice flows so well with these 12 new tracks. My thoughts on each track:<br />1. I'm A Slave 4 U (4.5/5) - One of the best songs on the album!<br />2. Overprotected (5/5) - A hot, up-beat, good old-fashioned pop song!<br />3. Lonely (5/5) - A gradual movement toward rock/r&b...awesome!<br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (4/5) - Beautiful ballad, much like \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\".<br />5. Boys (5/5) - THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM! Funky R&B sound to make you dance!<br />6. Anticipating (4.5/5) - Disco pop, Britney style! Really good.<br />7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll (4/5) - Very good but does not live up to \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" from her previous album.<br />8. Cinderella (4.5/5) - A lot like Overprotected.<br />9. Let Me Be (4/5) - Good song, light and funky.<br />10. Bombastic Love (4.5/5) - Another upbeat dance track from Max Martin!<br />11. That's Where You Take Me (3.5/5)- My least favorite, but still good. The \\"La La La\\"'s make it sound a bit childish.<br />12. What It's Like To Be Me (4/5) - Surprisingly good track with the backing vocals of boyfriend, Justin Timberlake.<br />Overall, its an exellent CD and I would reccommend it to ANYONE--not just Britney fans. For the next album, however, this may sound strange, but there should be some stronger language...nothing distastefull, but the \\"made-for-kiddies\\" songs are starting to get old (ex. Bombastic Love, Let Me Be, etc.)--sorry Brit, but I think it's time to say goodbye to Max Martin and friends.
B0000060NF|3.0|What's Going On is another one of those albums the critics say is indispensible to any music lover's collection and judging by the ecstatic reviews I've read, I know I'm swimming against the tide to say its not.<BR>Perhaps it is innovative in terms of what was happening in soul music at the time it was issued, but not in terms of the whole music picture. The vaunted percussion, while enjoyable, is pretty basic. Much more exciting things were happening in rock, blues, and jazz then and Gaye's \\"innovations\\" were timid by comparison.<BR>Marvin Gaye was essentially a top-40 singer and the fact that the two best songs on the album were AM hits for him bears this out. I don't like much top-40 music, but I do like Marvin Gaye's vocal style and the songs \\"What's Going On\\" and \\"Mercy, Mercy Me (the Ecology)\\" which are the reasons I took a chance on the CD. But those two are really all there is.<BR>The rest of the album is enjoyable but nothing else stands out. Inner City Blues is a great song, but not as performed by Gaye. Les McCann and Eddie Harris as well as Brian Auger do much better and more powerful versions.<BR>Fans of R&B and 60s top-40 will undoubtedly love this album, but to me it sounds a little dated. Only \\"Mercy, Mercy Me...\\" seems relevant still today. Those looking for a little more essence in their music can't help but agree that while this CD may be good, it is highly overrated.

0553062182|5.0|This is more of a testimonial than a review.<br />I was trapped by the title, so I bought the book, and took the survey on pages xxi-xxii, and got 18 out of the 23 right-a 79%!  So knew this book was for me!<br />I admire Dr.Aron's courage in writing this book, since, as she says in the introduction, that people who are highly sensitive are not the kind to be pushy about what happens to them, so she was really working against the grain to get this book published.<br />Growing up, I was always bothered by loud noises, and had trouble sleeping, since the street noises, the dim but ambient light in the room, and jets flying overhead kept me up.  Also my mind refused to stop working, so I had a hard time sleeping and would always get up early in the morning, being overwhelmed by the world around me.  I always felt that something wasn't quite right, but I couldn't put a finger on it, or vocalize my concerns since those of my family didn't have the same symptoms that I had.  Every time I would bring up something, I was called a liar, or accused of \\"faking it.\\"<br />I think part of my case was biological, since I have severe allergies to dust mites, and am asthmatic, which has caused me to put on a lot of weight.  Then factor in the psychology of this all, and you see what a fix I am in.<br />On the good side, I think I have always been able to enjoy music better than other people.  Being highly sensitive means that I am not filtering out as much stimulation as other people.  So I wouldn't do well at a rock concert, but in a more controlled setting, I can hear and perceive more in the music than most people.  Ditto for smell and taste.  If you have ever seen the TV show \\"The Sentinel,\\" you get the idea.  For those out of the loop, \\"The Sentinel\\" is soft-core sci-fi show about a cop how has heightened senses-hearting, sight, and whatnot--and uses these abilities to solve crimes.  The sad thing is that a person with heightened sense would be overwhelmed by this noisy world of ours.<br />This book by Dr. Aron is not just a feel-good book, although I am always content to rejoice in the truth, but it gives practical solutions to dealing with hypersensitivity.  She encourages you to take breaks from stimulating activities, and to do things slowly.  Don't compare yourself to other people who have duller senses, but do things on your own.  This will cause you to be separated from other people, but pretend you are a monk on retreat.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who feels overwhelmed by the stimulation round him or her!f ours. <br />This book by Dr. Aron is not just a feel-good book, although I am always content to rejoice in the truth, but it gives practical solutions to dealing with hypersensitivity.

B00004R99L|5.0|After reading some of these reviews, I almost get the feeling people are somewhat &quot;apologizing&quot; a little for this flick.  I am a huge Walt Disney fan and Alice In Wonderland is by far my favorite one (with Pinocchio and Peter Pan closely following).  The music score and sound FX are the tightest I think I've ever witnessed (from front to back) in &quot;any&quot; movie.  And the opening scene of the countryside, to the falling in the Rabbit hole and on through the many adventures ending with the classic Queen Of Hearts ending, I feel makes this a &quot;must have&quot; for any movie collector.  I can watch this over and over...and do!
0446525537|5.0|I'll be honest. I probably never would have heard of this book if the movie hadn't been created. But the movie AND the book tell such an AMAZING TOUCHING story that they both made me cry. I cried literally 20 minutes after I finished the book. I will give nothing away about the movie or book, but Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter are miracles to each other, it is so sad at the end. This film, book, and soundtrack are all so AWESOME!

B0000541VS|5.0|This is a very heart pounding film about true friendship. It makes you want to cry and leaves you extremely depressed. I sugget reading the book as well to give the movie more heart.

B000065U1N|5.0|SAVING PRIVATE RYAN forever changed the way war movies are made. Even mediocre war movies and a few bad ones that have been made since 1998 tend to have a more realistic portrayal of combat life. Having never served in the military I do not make this claim myself, but do so only after listening to veterans speak of their experiences and comparing them to what they now see on the screen.<br /><br />With that said, BLACK HAWK DOWN is an exciting and riveting film that neither downplays the U.S. involvement in foreign fields of conflict nor disrespects the men who serve. The movie moved me in much the same way that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did. I left the theatre feeling even more grateful to all those in uniform who risk their lives so that we, and so many others around the world, can enjoy the blessings of freedom.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's direction is genius and in BLACK HAWK DOWN he has made a worthwhile film that makes up for the fiasco that was HANNIBAL. There aren't very many stand-out performances in the film because it is an ensemble piece, but there are two exceptions. One is the pretty-boy Josh Hartnett who does a remarkable job as the character who is the moral center for most of the film. The other outstanding performance is that of Ewan McGregor. I didn't even know McGregor was in this film until the end credits rolled. His versatility as an actor continues to amaze me.<br /><br />A great film, not for the faint hearted, but should be watched by all Americans nevertheless.

B00AEFY5B6|5.0|Many years ago, Hollywood mass produced epic movies that were not only monuments of spectacle, but also contained meaningful messages that gave films moral magnitude as well. There are several reasons why Hollywood stopped making epic movies and just a few short years ago the great movie epic was said to be dead.<br />Well, the great movie epic is back. It began with BRAVEHEART in 1995 and reached new and different heights with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN in 1998. The tradition coninues with GLADIATOR.<br /><br />GLADIATOR is the story of Maximus, a fictional Roman general. Maximus is the greatest of all Rome's generals. A dying Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, chooses a reluctant Maximus as his heir. However, the Emperor's son, Commodus, has different ideas. Therefore, instead of the Imperial Palace in Rome, Maximus soon finds himself as a slave sold as a gladiator fighting to stay alive on the fringes of the Empire. Maximus is chosen to fight in Rome and from there he plots how to revenge himself against Commodus and make Rome a republic again.<br /><br />Russell Crowe plays Maximus and one word need only be said: amazing. After stellar performances in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR has cemented Crowe's place with the top echelon of Hollywood's elite. Other noteworthy performances include that of the late Oliver Reed, who plays the gladiator owner/trainer, and Djimon Hounson, who plays Maximus' gladiator friend.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott has revived the \\"Roman movie\\" with this awesome epic. The melding of great performances, visual scenery, special effects, and sound story is a testimony of Scott's skill as a filmmaker.<br /><br />GLADIATOR also contains a moral message. Maximus is a religious man; yes a pagan, but a religious one nonetheless. He is tossed around the wheel of fortune, yet ends the film as he began: a man of integrity and honor. All must die. Yet, it is how we live our lives that makes a difference. That's a lesson, especially in our current troubled times, that's worth hearing (and seeing) again and again.roubled times, that's worth hearing (and seeing) again and again.
0790738139|5.0|Film noirs are often a little bit hit and miss and for that reason I was a little dubious about seeing 'LA Confidential'.  However, after watching it late one night on TV I snapped it up straight away.  This is a one of a kind.  It's set in 1940's LA, a city of hope and dreams which hides corruption, betrayal, drugs and death behind its glitzy veneer, as we are told by Danny deVito writing for Hush Hush magazine.  We're introduced to three police officers first off: Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacet), a celebrity cop who is fond of scandal, Bud White (Russell Crowe) an agent who works things out with his fists, and Ed Exley (Guy Pierce), a by-the-book officer following in the footsteps of his father.  That the movie manages to get past these apparent stereotypes to show you that not is all as it seems (the very same thing that is said of Hollywood in the beginning) is a feat in itself.  That it's utterly engrossing with superb performances is another thing entirely.<br />There are various subplots that are woven together with style, with it all centering around high-class Veronica Lake-lookalike Lynne Bracken (Kim Basinger), a woman on the edge of snapping but managing to hang on by the skin of her teeth.  The movie poses various questions about judgement, morals and even the effectiveness of the law at the time to hand out efficient justice.<br />It's a shame that Kim Basinger was the only woman to receive an award for her truly excellent performance.  Perhaps it was the same case as with 'Thelma and Louise', that it would be unfair to choose one of the cast.  The three male leads are all revelations, interestingly enough each one just about to make a huge impact on the film world shortly after 'LA Confidential'.  Kevin Spacey gives a completely different performance as he did in 'The Usual Suspects' and 'American Beauty', the actor of his generation by a long shot.  Russell Crowe is great too, with his apparent brute violence hiding secret inner torment, and he's everybit as good as he was in 'Gladiator'.  Guy Pierce is absolutely superb, showing just what a star performer he is, something which is more than evident in the equally fantastic 'Memento'.<br />I urge you to go and see thing cunningly devised, pulse-pounding film noir.

It even shows both sides of the story which makes not at all bias.  I love the book and look forward to see the movie (&amp; I can't wait to get the DVD version of it too.).
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is an original, visceral odyssey to be enjoyed by young and old alike.  The amazing worlds created for this epic movie are as real as our own.  The Elwins and the Brownies both have unique and individual lifestyles and personality types.  It's a pure joy, every time I watch it.  Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis have a great kinship, and the laughs never stop.<br />This DVD version has wonderful behind the scenes photography and a special &quot;making of&quot; documentary.  It is well worth the price of admission, to be able to watch the magic again and again.
0380729407|4.0|If there's one thing that Ray Bradbury excels at, it's his ability to recapture the range of emotions and attitudes that were present in all of us when we were just young, impressionable children.  It's a sign of a talented writer if he or she is able to make the reader feel nostalgic for a childhood that one didn't have.   SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES pushes all the right buttons in reminding us of the wonder that was present in everyone.<br />A lot has been said about the prose of this book, and it's certainly of a higher quality than one would be expecting from a \\"horror\\" story.  It's quite poetic and most of the time it is excellent at painting the scene.  However, there are a number of places where it feels forced and pretentious, as if Bradbury is writing that way just to show off his thesaurus-reading skills.  But for every turn of phrase that falls flat, there exist several chilling moments that will be forever etched in the mind of the reader.  It's a step above the sort of material that one usually finds in genre works.<br />The point of view from the two children is executed amazingly well.  As in his other novels and short stories, Bradbury demonstrates his superb ability to realistically portray the beliefs and emotions of children.  They aren't overly mature, but neither are they childish.  He's hit the nail so perfectly that it really feels as though one is reading a true-life account of some curious boys, rather than a fictional account.  On the other hand, breaking up the action between two children means that we never really get extremely close to either one.  There's some nice interaction between one of the boys and his father that deals with the grown-up's attempt to develop a backbone and to stand up to the evil carnival people.  This relationship creates some great dialog between the child and parent, as the older man tries to explain thoughts and concepts that are just slightly outside what the child can realistically understand.<br />The story itself is quite chilling and is told well.  Many of the actions that occur don't really make much logical sense, but they are nonsensical in the same way that fairy tales don't make sense; everything works inside the current context and that's just fine for their purposes.  Evil men do evil deeds simply because they're evil.  Good men attempt to prevent the spread of evil, because that's what good men do.  Their motivation really isn't important.  What makes it work is the journey that the characters go through.  <br />SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES is certainly a recommended work.  Although often classified as a horror book, it really isn't all that frightening.  But it succeeds at being a fantastic adventure tale that will remain with the reader long after the final page is turned.
B0000027RL|5.0|I remember Pearl Jam from way back in the early 90s, but didn't really give them a chance.  Then, for some reason last year I was in a nostalgic mood and put 10 in the cd player and was simply floored and amazed and just silent for the 35 minutes this cd played.  I remembered Jeremy from the MTV video, but OH MY GOD, this CD is beyond words.  Now, each time i hear this cd, it brings be to tears.  The lyrics are so open to interpretation and SOOOOO POWERFULLY sung.  Eddie Vedder has a voice beyond compare.  Since then, I have all their albums, and although they dont make me cry like 10 does, I love them dearly.  If you call yourself a pearl jam fan and DONT have this CD, you can still be a pearl jam fan, but DUDE, GET ON IT!!!  I love how Pearl jam lyrics can let you make up what the singer is talking about because the lyrics are so open.  At least the singer knows what he's talking about.  Oh, and in one of the reviews it said \\"stone gossard and jeff ament are great guitar players.\\"  Jeff Ament is a bass player and Mike McCready is the amazing Guitar player.  Grrr, people should know what they are talking about before they make fools of themselves.  So, buy this CD because I love it.  NO, buy this CD because your life won't be complete without it.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I admit it, I bought _Mirrorball_ because I was cheap.  I didn't want to shell out for both _Fumbling Towards Ecstasy_ and _Surfacing_, but the McLachlan songs I'd loved on the radio were pretty much evenly distributed between the two albums.  Then McLachlan comes out with this live album, and Voila! it contains all of my then-favorites.<br />Oddly enough, the radio hits (\\"Adia\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Possession\\", etc.) are probably the ones that I play least these days.  I've fallen hopelessly in love, instead, with \\"Good Enough\\", \\"Do What You Have To Do,\\" \\"The Path of Thorns\\", and other less-known songs.  McLachlan is one of the best lyricists I've come across; she is never pretentious or stilted.  She can convey the deepest and most universal of emotions with nothing but simple everyday language and a haunting voice.  Other artists use long words and convoluted lyrics, or else revert to constant cliches, but only McLachlan seems to have the guts to just lay it right out there on the table.  When pressed for an example, I always quote \\"Hold On\\":  \\"Oh God, the man I love is leaving.\\"  Simple, and cuts straight to the point and to the heart,<br />And to those fans who say that _Mirrorball_ can't hold a candle to McLachlan's earlier albums, just be aware that it is _Mirrorball_ that has convinced me to go out and buy those earlier albums, now that I've gotten this wonderful taste.  If this is \\"bad\\" Sarah McLachlan, I'm more eager than ever to hear the good.
015670160X|4.0|This fake biography (complete with counterfeit photographs and an index) is not Virginia Woolf's greatest novel by any means--but even the least of her works must rank among the finest of early twentieth-century fiction.<br />The \\"plot\\" seems more appropriate to a Heinlein novel: a boy raised during the Elizabethan period becomes a woman, lives until the 1920s, and ages only 36 years. During the past century, the novel's reception has evolved much like its lead character: while early critics and readers praised the book as a literary parody bordering on farce, later generations have regarded the novel more as a commentary both on sexual roles and on the oppression of women. Some readers will see Orlando as representing, in human form, the evolution of literature (it`s telling that the only other character who lives as long as Orlando is a critic); some will focus on the novel's presentation of gender and sex. Both interpretations (and others) seem to be equally valid--which is why this book is so powerful even today.<br />One of the most charming (and surprising) qualities of the novel is Woolf's refusal to take herself or her book seriously. At times, the novel is laugh-out-loud funny. She mocks her own style (she interrupts one of her infamous run-on paragraphs with \\"nature ... has so much to answer for besides the perhaps unwieldy length of this sentence\\"), and she even makes fun of the book's very concept (when Orlando is not doing much of anything, Woolf exclaims: \\"If only subjects ... had more consideration for their biographers!\\"). \\"Orlando\\" infuses everyday life with both wit and elegance; or, as Woolf puts it, \\"when the shrivelled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the senses amazingly.\\"
B00005QDW5|5.0|The songs on this cd were all good but there should have been some live performances and some more songs in general. Also, a story booklet about the formation, success and fall of the band would have been nice too, most people probably wonder why Roger Waters is such a strange person. The live versions of Mother, Young Lust, the rare version of pigs on the wing and the normal version of goodbye blue sky would have been nice as well.
6303433766|5.0|Heavenly Creatures is one of the best movies of the '90s, especially for something based on a real life story.  It stars Kate Winslet (Titanic) and Melanie Lynskey (Ever After) as best friends who end up killing one of the girls' mothers.<br />It starts out with Melanie's character, the weird girl, who loves opera and worships a certain opera singer.  She ends up flirting with and sleeping with a man who stayed in her parents' boarding house.  She meets the new girl (played by Kate) and they realize that they both lead similar lives.  Both feel ignored by their parents.  Both were very sick as children.  Both feel kind of empty.  Both love opera.<br />Their friendship begins to blossom and under it, a forbidden love.  After Mel's character is diagnosed by a psychologist as a homosexual (this was from the 50s), her parents forbade her from seeing Kate's character for a while.<br />The two got back together and began to plot the murder of the mother of Mel's character.  At a very unsuspecting moment (for the mom), the two girls strike.<br />They thought that her death would allow them to be together forever, but it didn't.  The police found out what they had done (from a diary) and they were arrested.  They were both found guilty and sentenced.  One condition of their paroles--they could never see each other again.<br />Now, they lead somewhat normal lives as a writer (Kate's character) and, I believe, the other works with horses.<br />Anyways...this movie is a definite must-see!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink has never conformed to the commercial style of Britney and unlike Britney's new \\"not a girl, blah, blah\\" Pink's lyrics on this album are more deep, personal and make more sense than we've seen from a woman (especially on just the 2nd album) in a very long time. Although I wished there were a few more r&b/hip-hop tracks that bred her success, what she lacks in quantity she more than makes up for in quality. The soulful \\"Misery\\" (my favorite track) gives enough of a fix for any of her r&b fans. My favorite rock song off the album \\"Just Like a Pill\\" is a lacking lyrics the hook is catchy and honestly hearing a 10-second clip of the chorus is what made me rush to the stand and by the last available \\"Missundaztood\\" in the store. I haven't heard an album this diverse in ALL MY LIFE. Pink's new album is like a roller-coaster listening to. From the retrospective \\"My Vietnam\\" to the punk-urban track \\"Respect\\", her entire-person (in my opinion) is cast in \\"18-Wheeler\\". Pink's originality and diversity is possibly the key that'll make her a constant chart-topper for ATLEAST the upcoming years. I don't think we've seen an artist as honest as Pink since Janet Jackson. All-in-all, I recommend this album more for the lyrical content than the actual music style since it's so diverse. If you're not as open-minded to other genres as Pink and I are you'll atleast appreciate the honesty in her lyrics. If you don't have this album, buy it...
B00000JPYQ|5.0|UFO must have had something going that night in Chicago -- the kind of energy expressed on this album could wake the dead, or at least bring them to one of the best concerts of all time.  UFO at its zenith -- the only other live album I know of that comes close is Judas Priest's &quot;Unleashed in the East.&quot;  Close, but it doesn't quite cut it.<br />Everyone must have been at the absolute top of form that night... especially Michael Shenker.  Someone hand that guy a guitar! cuz it will be lying on the ground as confetti an hour later.  This album is my all-time favorite hard rock piece, and the definitive live album in the &quot;Brit-Metal&quot; genre.  Transcends the rock genre completely into the realm of musical poetry, especially on &quot;Lights Out,&quot; &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; and &quot;Out In The Street.&quot;  6 stars!
B00005IC2H|5.0|This cd contains some of the most beautiful, haunting music I have ever heard. The group is from Iceland, and I don't understand what they are singing, but it doesn't matter. Listening to it is almost a religious experience. The sound comes from the heart and soul, it is uplifting as well as sad, erotic and romantic, a veritable jigsaw puzzle of musical emotions. The voices are ethereal, and the music needs to be played over and over. I highly recommend this album.
B000002A3T|4.0|With this album and &quot;a Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;, post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd has proven that it can still create poetic lyrics and haunting melodies with the same or very nearly the same high level of brilliance and inspiration.<BR>As is the case with classic Pink Floyd albums, &quot;The Division Bell&quot; merits numerous listenings to fully appreciate all of its aesthetic nuances, something not unfamiliar to Pink Floyd fans.
6304007523|1.0|This has got to be the worst film I have ever seen in my life.  I cant believe that there is more that one in the series.  I absolutly hated it.  I have never liked a film with Sylvester Stallone in it.  Have you seen his mother, You cant tell them apart when there standing next to each other.
6300218031|4.0|This movie is often overlooked when discussing John Hughes films. I am not going to recap the mlovie because i think it will lose something for someone who hasn't seen it yet.  I will say that I think it shows true teen angst better than any other movie, including the Breakfast Club.  It is funy, smart, romantic and suprising.  Great performances, a well written script and excellent direction makes this a must see for fans of 80's movies.  Watch it again.
B000002LHT|4.0|Just as the Ramones faced a crisis in 1979, wondering where they should allow musical direction to drift in the early '80s post-punk confusion, they also faced a similar crisis ten years later. The band was looking for another new direction. The Ramones struggled to keep their fan base all decade long, shining momemtarily on \\"Too Tough to Die\\" and \\"Animal Boy,\\" but otherwise came up lackluster. The two really good albums from the '80s, \\"Pleasant Dreams\\" and \\"Subterranean Jungle,\\" were panned by critics and ignored by fans. Now, come 1989, they were tired, were about to lose their long-time bassist, and looking to make a bold statement.<br />That statement came in the form of the extremely hard-hitting \\"Brain Drain.\\" The Ramones re-invented their sound in a fitting way for the explosion of nu metal, grunge and retro punk that would define the '90s, and brought them into that decade looking and sounding relevant.<br />\\"Brain Drain\\" does not follow the Ramones' punk formula. The album is mostly goth rock and proto-heavy metal. But it works. The production is as heavy as it gets, but is also necessary. The songs wouldn't work if not for the bone-crunching sound that master chops man Bill Laswell provides. In short, \\"Brain Drain\\" is a seriously loud album, but enjoyable.<br />I could do without \\"Palisades Park,\\" which is just downright silly and doesn't fit well into the album, but the other songs jive with their new direction in style and sound. Excepting the obvious \\"Pet Sematary,\\" the best songs are \\"I Believe in Miracles,\\" \\"Zero Zero U.F.O.,\\" \\"Don't Bust My Chops,\\" \\"Learn to Listen,\\" and \\"Can't Get You Outta My Mind.\\"<br />Considering this was Dee Dee's swan song with the Ramones (before returning years later stricly in the role of songwriter), you'd think that he'd have more lead vocal duties. Dee Dee delivers a delicious vocal performance on \\"Punishment Fits the Crime,\\" accentuating the lyrics in poignant style. He should have sung \\"Zero Zero U.F.O.\\" and \\"Ignoranceis Bliss\\" as well (not to demean Joey's vocals in any way). Also, Bill Laswell, a bassist himself, didn't do Dee Dee any favors either by mixing his bass well into the background. The bass is a barely audible thump, song after song. Shameful.<br />However, despite any oversights in vocal duties or production techniques, \\"Brain Drain\\" is a stellar album, featuring very rich and satisfying heavy rock. If you're looking for an album that defined the Ramones during the early '90s, forget the miserable \\"Mondo Bizarro.\\" Listen to \\"Brain Drain\\" instead.

B000002UA0|5.0|This album could have been the beginning of something less than monumental. As many think it already is I think that if Floyd would have not dropped Barret the albums that followed would not have been so depressing. But they dropped him for the obvious reasons, he was paranoid and on LSD. But I guess this just adds to their appeal and shows Floyd can survive the Bubble Gum Pop Century.
0385505833|2.0|I have not read any other Grisham book so I had no expectations when I bought it.  Fortunately it was short and an easy read so I was able to finish it in a couple of days.  I read the book a few days after Christmas and it just reminded me of all the craziness of the holidays which by then I had conveniently forgotten.  The prevailing of the Christmas spirit at the end of the story was certainly not enough to justify the long &quot;adventure&quot; leading up to it.  All in all, the story was depressing.
