B002VANNWY|5|Very good
B00B1TKY8C|5|Very nice and well constructed.
B001F634UQ|5|Everyone told me I might have to pay up to $600 for a great set of professional shears. I bought these for my daughter who tells me they work great. The price was definitely right, and because we've never compared them to $600 shears, I would rate as five stars.
B00HZKU3S2|1|Not working at all,and itch my skin,do not recommend
B00YLO129O|5|I received this foundation compliments of #influenster and all opinions are my own.<br /><br />I have never used this kind before, but I have to say that I will more than likely be buying<br />every couple of months, as I've used it everyday since receiving.<br /><br />It's very lightweight and silky, and doesn't irritate my skin.
B009ZVHRY2|2|Don't like the fragence
B004BVMKRA|4|i ordered 2 of these wigs one in black and the other in 1B30. the curls are very big and bouncy and beautiful. only thing it seems with the 1B30 wig the color treated(highlighted) hairs are a little straw like. i guess this happens during the color treating process. but over all if you like curly wigs you will love this one. just to warn you now the wig is ALOT more curly when you take it out the box than shown on the picture so if you want the look of the model on the front of the package it will take some styling to acheive that look. oh and if you want to flat iron this wig don't expect it to revert back to being curly. i tried that with the black one and BIG MISTAKE but i cut it and made it work for me. overall i REALLY LIKE this wig and appreciate the style of it and will be ordering another (black lol) one in the future.
B000URKWQU|5|This lotion is creamy without being excessively greasy. The three pack was a perfect value. I keep one in my room, one in my purse and gave another to my son. (The winter months can be brutal to our skin!)
B00655MJT4|1|Streaks really bad!!!
B003AKZCPU|2|I thought this one might be better than a toe clipper. Although it is made as a quality product, it's not as useful as a toe clipper.  And it's pricy. A toe clipper with larger opening should be better, which I am still searching for.
B00JEQKHW2|5|I received a sample of pop! goes the shadow in my ipsy glam bag a few months ago and it's now my go to color! I loved it so much that I decided to get an accent color as well. Thanks!
B006OGJMSU|5|this stuff smells freaking great! not as strong as i thought it was going to be, but still very pleasing. very, very similar to YSL opium.
B00B0RHJB0|4|This is a great shampoo.  The shampoo I had been using lately was not cleaning as well, and this was just what my hair needed for a pick me up! And my hair is so shiny!!
B00BWTZ3ZK|5|Makes my skin feel wonderful
B00LGPPMO2|1|weird scent
B0001AF6QM|5|This Skin Trip Coconut soap is more than just great smelling. It is top quality natural soap. I highly recommend this soap to all Coconut lovers. If you love the smell of Coconut then this product is for you!!
B000UPT8RG|5|works great
B000AMA43Q|5|I live in a condo that has a very, very small washer and dryer, so I don't have the room or the time to do much laundry. With regular towels, I can only put three in the washer, and it ends up taking 2 hours to wash and dry them! These towels are perfect for apartment-style living! I can throw this towel in the washer and have a TON of room for all the other things I need washed, too! The absorbancy factor is great, my hair is not frizzy after keeping my hair wrapped in the towel, and it's pretty soft. My husband and I are very thin, so I thought this size towel would be great for drying off, but unfortunately, they barely wrap around our bodies enough to tie them on the side and wear them around the house. So, I would use these towels as a baby towel or very large hand/face towel instead of a bath towe. I'll definitely buy the larger one in the future.
B002CML21U|1|Um... $26 for 1.7 oz is $15.29/oz not $9.xx/oz as stated<br />don't understand the mistake.  is the package truly 1.7 oz?
B00GHNOQ54|5|not enough light play on my shorter fingernails, will try again when they get longer.<br /><br />EDITED NOTE!! Jan. 12, 2015.. My nails are short again, but I have grown to LOVE, LOVE this polish! First of all, I put it on in globs last August. Not Good, not at all. Here is what I do now:<br /><br />First, I put a good base coat on, then at least 3 THIN coats of polish. After they have dried completely, I put on a top coat and then Seche Vite!  ([[ASIN:B007U90J5U 2 BOTTLES Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat .5 oz PROFESSIONAL Clear High Gloss 83005]])  Amazing results will be seen on your nails if you do this too!<br /><br />Or you can do the base coat, a coat of black nail polish and one coat of This Beautiful Light Playing Nail Polish... K B Shimmer, Rollin With The Chromes. If done properly, your nails will look just like the picture, under a lamp or out in the sun, light blue chrome to a pinky violet, then darker purple, then back again. They are always changing. So, you have a wardrobe of colors on your finger tips. Almost no need to change the color, ever!<br /><br />Now, I followed the 3 coat way, and have had my polish on for almost a week -- washing dishes, scrubbing tubs, Mod Podging and not babying them in any way. I had one tiny spot flake off, and I just touched it up. When I take it off, there has never been any staining. I use Opi Base Coat and Opi Top Coat, maybe that is why, don't know. ([[ASIN:B004B3YC9M OPI Natural Nail Base Coat & Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5]])<br /><br />Hope this helped anyone who is on the fence about this polish, it is so pretty and fun to do, takes me 30 minutes or so, while watching a program.  Also, it is creamy and easy to apply, and fun to watch as the light starts to reflect off of the built up coats. ENJOY!  :-)
B00A8DHHNC|1|This picture is not what I received. I got to little heart shaped ones. If I wanted that, I wouldn't have ordered this. I don't like being decieved
B00C4P11QG|5|These clips are so very pretty. I bought 2 and they are perfect size for one on each side of my hair. i love em.
B00107BB82|1|Dont get me wrong i love this stuff , but i found the same product at walmart for 4.97 . 14.99 is way to much .
B004LYKQ9G|5|I make my own lotions and soap and use grapefruit essential oil frequently because of its smell and cellulite/ water reducing properties. This particular oil is a very nice quality - clean distillation and a nice aroma profile. Its also the absolutely best price I've found for it so far.
B00MG7RQPM|5|I was very excited to try this product!  It arrived on time, boxed in a sturdy box to protect the product.  The actual packaging for the product is very nice.  The jar itself is of a very heavy frosted glass (to me that equals a bit more expensive, as it isn't plastic).  The only issue I had is the lid didn't twist securely on (luckily, I wasn't travelling anywhere).<br /><br />Upon opening the jar a nice scent emerged.  It isn't powdery nor floral smelling.  The best I can describe is it smells clean but in a very sublet way.  The cream is wonderfully thick and satiny, not greasy at all.  I use Mineral makeup and normally use a Primer, but this moisturizer almost had the same feel as my primer.  So, I stopped using my primer and only this moisturizer before applying my makeup (who doesn't love having one less thing to do to beautify yourself?)<br /><br />The BEST part of this product?!?!?!  My husband actually asked me what I was doing different, my skin had a glow.  I am in my mid 30's and have a very youthful appearance as it is. But for my HUSBAND a GUY, DUDE, MAN...part of the opposite sex that doesn't notice things like this to notice and comment was amazing.  In addition to my husband commenting my MOTHER IN LAW (God rest her soul) said I had a glow and asked if I was pregnant (I AM NOT!!!!).<br /><br />****I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion****
B00AE07H0M|5|I really like this product, I can tell a difference in my hair,has more body and shine. Also smells so good.
B00CN2UO2M|5|The product of the quality is good . I Love  my bag that I purchase with them.<br />The price is right .But Hope next time the service was faster.
B007SZCG0C|5|This shampoo is awesome! Let me just start of by saying that I have had issues with hair falling out in clumps since giving birth. I have tried many things to help me with my hair loss and thinning hair, from natural remedies to pills, and so far this is the only product that has made a real difference. From the first time I washed my hair, I noticed right away that it looked and felt much thicker. I also noticed a lot less of hair falling out in the shower, yay! I am really happy that this is geared towards women as well, since most hair growth products are geared towards men,so my insecurities as a woman suffering from hair loss subsided. I also thought that since it is made using caffeine, it would have a strong smell, but surprisingly it  smells very nice and refreshing. It also feels refreshing too since it has almost a cooling effect once applied. It is definitely well worth the money spent. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and I plan on using this shampoo for a while, until my hair returns to it's full former glory, which I am sure it will since this shampoo has already made such a difference.
B00KOKZ844|5|Used this just once so far and I am sold on it. My hair detangled easily and is very soft. I have naturally curly/wavy hair, and this was great for it! A little bit really does go a long way. I used a lot less of this than any other conditioner. It is very thick and moisturizes instantly.
B0089GBCEK|4|Love this
B000068PBT|5|Made in the Netherlands, not China! Far superior to original blades, made I china? I dunno all, I know is best shave yet from Norelco!
B000TUC9AA|5|i bought this brush 3 years ago and im still using it!!! this product holds up much better than other brands that i've bought. doesnt compare to the others that you buy from duane reade or rite aid that just snaps in half within 1 week of purchasing.  i have mirrors brushes and nail clippers from swissco and they are all great. im a customer for life
B00CB87BQ0|5|Great price per oz. Works great. They were using this at my barber shop, so I picked some up on Amazon. Nice hold and I'll be buying again, whenever this huge can runs dry.
B00469V5QO|5|We love this soap, it smells SO clean and fresh.
B008GOR6O0|4|it is a great product but i thought it would be a larger palette, I was a bit disappointed but the colors are great
B007K6K0IY|5|Ever have one of those days that just seems to drag along, you get frustrated, hot and sweaty and all of a sudden, your deodorant fails? Well that's happened to me before so I was delighted to be able to try a free sample Secret Outlast® Clear Gel because I knew I would be going on a road trip with friends and I knew that the party would go on and on so I didn't want my deodorant to stop working! When I used this deodorant I first noticed the great smell, it smelled so fresh and clean as if I and just stepped out of the shower. I figured that this scent would go away after a few hours but I continued to smell it the entire road trip through three states!  When I finally had the chance to take a shower, I didn't even smell bad because this deodorant prevented me from becoming all wet and sweaty. The best part is, I brought dark clothes with me, which can be a pain because I always get white deodorant marks. This deodorant is fast drying so you can just throw it on as your rushing to get out of your motel room and on to your next journey. It will go on clear, dries right away, evaporating in seconds and won't stain your clothes! I love the fact that it is specially designed to adhere to your skin so I don't have to worry if my underarm gets accidentally rubbed on your shirt or someone else's!  The dual action odor technology actually works before you even start to sweat and it minimizes the bacteria that causes odors. I can't believe it lasted for me a 48 full hours even when it was 90 degrees outside. I am so happy that I decided to bring my free sample of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel deodorant with me on my road trip, and I'm sure my friends sitting next to me were glad too! I smelled great the entire trip and felt the freshest and cleanest I've ever felt!
B00PWYSYOI|4|It's as good as most other moisturizers I've used but it's no better.  There are others I've purchased for less that have worked as well so I won't be purchasing this product again.
B000O2M2UA|2|Even with all the attachments, this diffuser did not fit my Conair hair dryer.  I could barely squeeze on the largest fitting, but it would continually pop off while I was drying my hair and eventually cracked down the side from being shoved on too many times.  I was very disappointed and ended up having to buy a new hair dryer that came with its own diffuser attachment.  I am sure the product would be fine with the right hair dryer.
B00P1Q35N2|5|This is the BEST daytime moisturizer that I've ever used. I love everything about it; from the packaging, to the nice light sent, to how it makes my face feel pampered, to how smoothly my makeup goes on over it. I think it's fabulous!!!
B00A3PJLD4|5|good item
B0071XOJKG|3|Smells good but a little to runny for me
B005A5Y55G|5|If you are a woman and love the scent of chocolate, slap this on your man.  It's like a magnet pulling you towards the neck.
B00P8FAN40|5|I tried this around my eyes where you get wrinkles at the sides and I definitely like the tightening feeling and it didn't take that much product to cover the area. So far so good.
B0014KPYFG|5|great comb! for waves
B007JJ2DO6|4|Very nice lip balm. It's huge. So you get a lot of product. This will last me for quite awhile. I like that it doesn't have an overly coconut scent. It's just light enough that I get a hint of it and it's not overwhelming. I received this at a discounted rate for honest review.
B0027LSEPS|5|Similar to a waterpik, not quite as powerful. However, it's low price and convenience/portability factor make it a super buy. I think it's awesome.
B003UAZB7E|5|I have been using this product for a few months now, and absolutely love the way it works! I noticed a reduction in the number of breakouts right away, and my skin feels smooth and soft, even in cold weather. This is the first product I've ever used that was successful in getting rid of extra oil without causing excessive dryness. I definitely recommend everyone with oily skin to give this a try.
B00GGO6AT4|3|Unless you're NOT big on skin care in general, you might be better to simply go with a Mia version by Clarisonic. If you already dry brush, scrub, and blah blah blah, you're not likely to see a big benefit out of the full body action of the Plus. Personally, the most impressive part about the full body cleansing was my back. I'm pretty flexible and always thought I exfoliated my back fairly well. This device made a noticeable improvement in softness/smoothness of the skin on my back after the first use. Otherwise, I'm not very impressed. To me, this just means I should get a dry brush with a long handle! Using the Clarisonic has not eliminated the need to use other methods of exfoliation.    Additionally, I'm not too crazy about the body scrub by Clarisonic. It leaves a residue-y sort of film on the skin that I wasn't too happy about. I prefer this with my regular cleansers, but don't see anything good about it that accounts for the cost or trouble. However, this might work very well for those who don't have/make the time to exfoliate regularly. It's just not going to do better than the old fashioned ways. As well, you'll end up using a lot more of your cleansing product with the Clarisonic brush compared to using a body mitt.    For the face, it is good at removing left over makeup. I oil cleanse to remove make up and alternate between glycolic acid and enzyme cleansers for my face. However, I'm not a person who wears heavy make up. I found that after oil cleansing the clarisonic was able to remove even more makeup still. As such, I think it's a good product, especially for daily makeup wearers. However, as I do exfoliate my skin regularly, this hasn't made any difference in the softness of my skin or anything so far. I'll give it more time and update if my pores are any clearer with continued use. I haven't tried their face washes yet. I wanted to just see the difference the brush on its own would make first.    I think it's worth noting that, the delicate brush may be essential for a lot of people who choose to use this system. The normal brush is entirely too rough. It's also worth it to consider that the regular Mia only has one speed. If you choose not to get the Plus, you should definitely choose a version with a gentle setting. Even if you're careful not to press down, the wrong brush and wrong speed will be pretty abrasive. Expect your face to be a little red for a couple of days.    It's tempting to want to go for the best of the best, but if you're already a skin fanatic you probably won't benefit by spending the extra money on the Plus. And, the charge doesn't last very long at all! The Mias supposedly hold their charges longer... something to keep in mind.    I decided to buy the Clarisonic after testing the Olay ProX for proof of concept. While I hated the Proactive brush, I did notice that the Olay removed some extra make up after oil cleansing. For me, however, the Olay was just too abrasive. It's a cheaper option to consider, though, if you don't wear makeup a lot and would only use the system once or twice per week. The Olay is about as abrasive as the normal Clarisonic brush.    **Update** Sorry for the length, but I think it's worth noting that the products you use are a huge part of how well you'll like the Clarisonic. As mentioned above, I used the brush with my normal products to see how the brush itself would do. After awhile I started to notice my skin looked a tad worse and... OILY. I have sensitive, combination skin. I'm prone to both winter dryness and clogged pores. At night, I always use a cream by Roc and had *never* experienced it to make me oily or break out. I figured that cleaning my face with the clarisonic before applying the cream probably had something to do with it. So, I switched my face wash to Oxy Clinical at night, toned with neutrogena clear pore, closed my pores with ice, applied proactiv cream where needed, and moisturized with Aveeno positively radiant. Problem solved!    Thing is, I can't say that the improvement had much to do with the brush. Oxy Clinical is pretty good but a raw deal for combination or dry skin. I reached for it because of the excessive oiliness I was experiencing. I will continue to use the clarisonic in the evenings and update after continued use. So far, I'm still not seeing the great pores I hoped for, but again... I might need to look for better products. I should also add that my skin did not like the honey mask after cleaning with the clarisonic! Again, I've *never* had a problem with honey ever, but I reacted to the honey when I used the mask after cleaning with the clarisonic. Honey has always been what I used when I reacted to other products. So for the honey to have an adverse affect after so many years of use could only be blamed on the clarisonic. I haven't given up on this yet. It's just good to be aware that it can make your skin more sensitive... I suppose because this system actual helps your skin to absorb products better.
B00HM6D30E|4|Smells great and I can already feel a difference after only 1 week. Will change the rating to five after longer use.
B002DPUXZC|5|good
B00NTBS568|5|Great product...quick delivery
B0083X3P9E|5|What can I say about a product that gives you the best looking pedicure, including those in a salon? Just that I love, love, love these Impress brand toenails. No more back-breaking pedis for me - these nails are ready to press on just by removing the light backing covering the glue. No more will I ever spend the time polishing my toenails and cleaning up the misses, then waiting forever to have them dry. Just maintain your toenails' length and cuticles, then in minutes easily apply these professional-looking polished nails. They should stay on as long as three weeks (wearing sandals), and will never lose their shine. You'll always look like you just stepped away from a Fifth Avenue salon manicurist.
B00HQ4W8RQ|5|Thr mattifying treatment is the BEST for oily skin!
B001E91ERO|3|Beware, it says gel, but when it was delivered it was pure paste.  Paste is okay, but I spent extra time looking for a gel.  My wife opened it up and used it before I could return it, so for the next 6 months...ugh.
B00IT06Y3K|4|It lathers well, smells good (not overpowering and reasonably priced. I expect to buy more as I replace a couple of others that are wearing thin.
B00IDT7KQ2|5|the colors are very pretty, you could get away with only putting on 3 thin coats. shipped really fast!
B00SA26JHI|1|Doesn't do anything!
B00IKTU2XS|3|My daughter wanted these, you can barely see the polish on the nail unless you put a TON of coats on! Then its so thick that it just kind of peels off on its own.. She likes them, but I'm not a fan,
B0009EXOO6|5|Love this product.  Makes my hair so soft and easy to work with.
B004V50HJE|5|LOVE THIS PRODUCT
B001ET76EY|5|Classic
B004VW630O|5|This is helping to keep my pores clean, and gives a better look to my complexion. I use it at night, followed by moisturizer. I have definitely noticed a difference in my pores (which are large and tend to clog). Will definitely keep buying.
B0013WFHAC|4|I found the stencils a little difficult to use the first few times but with practice I think it will get easier.  Have always liked Fran Wilson products.
B0002WTGPQ|5|I bought this stuff not too long ago, basically on a whim. That, and the vibrator told me I needed it. Well....shazam. I'm hooked. From the first time I delicately dipped a trembling finger into this languid tub of goo, I felt a tingle in my nether regions....a rush of heat to my loins, and I could almost detect the pulsating throb of the little man in the rowboat. Then, before I started to pass out, I began buffing my stiffened nipples with this stuff. It's like Turle Wax fer yer teets. I spent the next several hours finding creative uses for this product. Not only will it give you new shiny new headlights that will blind a wombat, it makes an excellent salad dressing too. You can also waterproof your pussy with it....and who doesn't appreciate a dry cat? I ask you...<br /><br />So if you are tired of using Crisco on your areolal area, use this.<br /><br />Martha Stewart
B00NWAIHHS|5|If you love makeup you know there is a $3 lipstick next to your $20. Simply because great makeup can be found any where but that is not always the case with beauty tools. Beauty tools need investment and a little research. That is why I am so excited to have found this tool. It is actually a affordable, and yet high-end design beauty must.<br /><br />The Occhio Beauty Eyelash Curler Set is such amazing eyelash curler set. I love the non-slip handle, and couture design. Truly gives my lashes a va va voom lash look. That for me is not always easy to achieve. I have smaller lids and can not always get that full curl but then again that is when a great tool comes in. This is that tool. No matter your eye shape or size, you can achieve a great youthful eye look with ease. No more pinches, uneven eye lashes or eyes that look tired. Now you have curl, lift, and eyes that look awake and youthful.<br /><br />Plus it comes with a beautiful free mirror and tweezer set. How amazing is that?<br /><br />This is a highly favored beauty item from this beauty blogger. Truly highly recommend.
B004I6PU7A|5|I saw this online and have been pining away for it for about a year now.  Well, I lucked up and found one for a STEAL and could not pass it up.  I am an African American woman with relaxed hair, but I have gone without a relaxer for the past five months and my natural hair is curly.<br /><br />I used this iron after I let my hair dry naturally and let me tell you; it only took one pass!!!  Your hair will not snag on the plates due to the fact that the plates \\"float\\"; they move with the direction of your hair.  My hair is sleek, silky and full of body!!  I have been dying for an iron that willo straighten my hair with as little heat as possible and this is it!!  Not only can I straighten my hair, but this iron is so versatile that I can create bouncy curls and flips with ease!!<br /><br />IF YOU DON'T YET OWN THIS FLAT IRON, PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET ONE!!!
B0000AFUTL|5|This was just what I was looking for.  Great price as well. It tucks nicely to the sideof my cabinet and is out of the way.
B00E81GE84|2|Shocking, as I LOVE the shampoo.  It felt a little too &#34;gelly&#34; where I prefer more creamy ones.
B00GNKRAOU|1|PerfumeLA wants to charge 180.00 for this? I just bought 2 on Ebay for  50 each.<br /><br />Apparently, Ralph Lauren discontinued this product so if you want it, better go and seek the last few bottles out now.  But for God's sake don't pay nearly 200 bucks for it!!!
B000I5MJ8S|5|I love using this applicator to apply my make up. Creates a smooth finish and is easy to clean too.
B00400B7RQ|5|amazon amazing deal for gucci just love it..
B007SNGSFS|5|Smells nice and fresh and keeps the razor clean.  Easy to install.  Fits and works as good as the original.
B003O7IBZC|3|Very nice cream for babies with eczema
B00433P7HG|5|I CAN HIKE ALL DAY BY THE SEA, SALT, ENCRUSTED FACE!...<br />AND STILL BE ABLE TO GO TO A MEETING AFTERWARDS, AND HAVE A VERY NICE LIP TINT.<br />FANTASTIC PRODUCT!
B000SIFG3A|5|Gets rid of cooking odors on you hands and has a wonderful scent.
B003EDDI0Y|4|My item arrived in 2 days through my Amazon Prime. It was packaged with several other items in a box. This item was in a separate bag with bubble wrap round it and the box had ample bubble packets in it also. This item was perfect. All the petals were intact and the clip was fine. Since several others said theirs arrived broken, I wanted to say it is possible to receive it perfect. I only gave it 4 stars since I have not used it in my hair yet, so I don't know how well it holds. It is very pretty.
B0017WMOIG|5|excellent product and shipping was fast
B003GDBEBM|5|These are great sponges if you don't need something incredibly soft and want some mild exfoliation. The material is not silky and they are not particularly dense. Personally, I prefer this as I think it adds to the exfoliation and the durability. These can be used for a long time, but this will of course depend on your preference. Unlike many other brands, they don't start to become unwound after a month or two of use. It's also great that these are made of recycled plastic, I don't see any reason to waste plastic (oil) on a different, non-recycled brand sponge when these are as good as they are.
B00GP9ZE10|3|Can leave puddles if not left on the edge of a counter. Also, the light stays on one color, not rotating through the colors nicely like another one we have. On a positive note,  there are 2 levels of brightness. Other than that, it does work. Just need to be careful
B000LLSXG6|5|I got a tiny jar at the grocery store and fell in love with how perfect it was for feet!!  Regular lotions seem to dissappear without doing any good, but this product leaves your feet smooth and soft!!
B000P9GN52|4|Great dye, lasts much longer than \\"Raw\\" brand dye.  As a semi-permanent, it still doesn't hold too long (needs frequent touch-ups), but it doesn't seem to stain other surfaces nearly as much as other kinds I've tried.  It's an incredibly vivid color.  Head's up, though--it's much more blue-purple than purple-purple.
B002DNAQHO|5|Good price for a basic item.  Nice size--not huge, not tiny.  Good grip.  Bristles hold up as well as brushes at 3 times the price.  Bristle density and firmess are, I'd say, a &#34;medium', which I like (I don't want to use a wire brush on my fingers!)
B00NQL5G6S|5|Very nice phone cover, especially for the price with free shipping.  Have received several compliments on how cute it is. At first it was a little stiff, but it has softened and loosened up with use.
B000C230JE|5|It took almost 3xs the estimated time to be delivered due to the weather, but it is the best smelling so far of all the Boss Colognes my husband has used so far... ;)
B004YBW5T0|5|I really like this Shea butter!  It was very easy to work with. I used it when I made cuticle cream. I'm going to use it in making body butter soon. I think it will be fantastic!
B00CMFO5OS|5|Love it
B003COAFPQ|4|Smells terrible but I have noticed my hair is much more stronger now after about four months using it. Will recommend it.
B000N3EGDG|5|I absolutely love this brush. Its a soft brush yet it penetrates the hair so that you get a wonderful scalp message. My hair is mid back length and this sz large brush is a perfect size for me. I originally purchased this brush for my dog but once it arrived, it only took a couple of brush strokes through my hair for me to decide that I had to keep it for myself.<br />I absolutely would recommend this brush to anyone looking for a great brush.
B001MA0QY2|5|I absolutely love it! All of the reviews I read about it were accurate!
B0097G3XDY|5|This product really works!  Love it.
B0046XOUSA|5|This is a large container for the .  Excellent for dry skin and base for homemade wrinkle cream/moisturizer. Love the smell and this actually soaks into your skin instead of sitting on top.
B00YVCWUCE|5|Very surprised how much easier it is brushing out my knotty hair, wet or dry, with this brush and will be buying more for my family, thank you!
B008U2X5J8|5|good quality product - I would definitely order again
B0023A7JF4|5|This soap clears your skin so fast and it smells amazing!!!
B003TEQYZE|5|I picked up a sample size can of this stuff while on a trip to Germany and I loved the smell and the way it worked. I did not perspire as much and the scent of the spray remained strong enough to cover up any unpleasant underarm B.O. Before leaving Germany I bought a few full size cans to take home with me as I'd never seen this stuff for sale Stateside before. I was very glad to see that this spray is available on Amazon.com. In this reviewers opinion the smell is more appealing than Axe or other popular deodorant body sprays and it keeps odor and perspiration down to a minimum much more effectively. There are a few different scents available from Nivea and each one of them smells and works great. My girlfriend goes crazy about the smell of this stuff, too. I would recommend this stuff to any guy, unless you don't like smelling good.
B001DYM62C|5|This little guy does a professional type haircut.  On my first use, it was easy to work with and did a surprisingly good job.  Anyone can use this product. I highly recommend it to any one.  I love mine.
B0014P8L9W|5|A+++
B00551CPIY|5|I got this specifically to use for the longer, high-quality paper guest towels that I can buy in larger quantities on amazon versus the expensive smaller pkgs at bed bath and beyond
B003WL42JY|4|It does the job just fine for my needs. Some other guards I tried made me feel like I was preparing for a boxing match before bed and were very uncomfortable, this one is very nice to sleep with in your mouth. No soar gums or sensitive teeth in the morning, and I'm sure the wife likes not hearing my grinding teeth anymore. Not a bad product at all, the only things I would like is some kind of cleaning rinse solution to leave it in before the next use.
B0016M1PVY|5|I only bought this because I could fit one more polish in my order without increasing the shipping, I wanted to try something out of my regular zone of colors and decided to go WAY OUT of my zone.  I love black and gray for clothes and household items and pretty much anything - but never for nails. I certainly never thought either should be worn by anyone over 25, 30 at the most. I am creeping out of my 30's soon but figured I could wear it on the weekend, when I'm home, or give it to my nieces if it looks really bad.  Obviously I had no plans for this to be anything wearable-since I had figured the options for what if I hate it.    I LOVE IT!  First of all, this was my first time ever trying China Glaze polish - bought a few bottles in this order in different colors.  The creme colors like this one are absolutely amazing.  I have used the cheapest $1 bottles of polish, Revlon-drugstore/middle of the road, Zoya, up to OPI's DS at $12.50 and was shocked how much better China Glaze (cremes) is better than anything I have ever tried before - EVER. I do my own nails, haven't had a professional manicure in 7 years-since the price has skyrocketed where I live, never heard of China Glaze, and for $3.99 was skeptical - but could get so many more colors for my money, so I took the risk. It is the perfect thickness so you can use only 1 or 2 coats, depending on your preference, has a nice size quality brush, dries nicely and quickly, no streaking, no lifting of the color on the second coat (since I never wait until the first coat dries).  When it dries, it is unbelieveably glossy - looks wet for a week.  I was afraid to touch anything for 3 hours-because it looked WET! STUNNING, really stunning. I finally was sure it was dry and realized days later, it really stays looking like the first day.    As for the color, it doesn't look like trendy goth or grunge (as they used to call it),old cement or trendy but tacky, or \\"I wish I was in high school\\".  It could be worn with your most casual clothes-sweats or a beautiful gray suit, or a charcoal silk dress, no matter, it is so beautiful, I really can't believe it. I didn't use a top coat because it really wasn't needed but about four days into the polish, I tried an OPI DS \\"Glitter Bit of Music\\" Top Coat that came with another polish as a bonus item.  You can barely see the glitter at all (which I love) but it gives you a sparkle in the light that you can't really tell what it comes from.  The next day, I painted the tips (like french manicure) on two of my nails with Opi Coronation (a mild silver, not bling, just silver) to see what it looked like and it was really pretty.  Two totally different colors, totally different types of polish, but they blended perfectly and you could tell it was a french man. but just barely. Another time I painted it over China Glaze FOR AUDREY (a beautiful Tiffany blue creme) which changed it a little to have a nice gray/blue tint, another beautiful manicure - that lasted a week.    Anyway, the point is, it can be worn in so many ways, and be classy.  I would bet you could use a matte top coat to change it from glossy to matte if you wanted, I also considered something fun would be a pale pink with it as a french manicure - maybe not for me, perhaps a younger person, I'd have to see it to know if  I could pull it off but a Creamy, pastel pink might be nice. This turned out to be a truly Multi-use polish, that started out as a one-time try it out when I don't have to go anywhere.    For those who can only wear certain colors:  My skin tone is medium/slightly tan, medium brown hair, and nails are usually medium to short, always trying to get them to grow long, strong and healthy, with only intermittent luck.  All of my \\"gray\\" manicures were with medium/short nails except the last one over FOR AUDREY, by which time my nails were a solid medium length, close to long.  I don't know if the polish kept them healthy enough to grow or not, but they have not broken since Istarted using the polish in this order (which had a couple OPI and a ZOYA).  Keeping them polished at all can be helpful so it may have nothing to do with the China Glaze brand. Because of health reasons, I can't keep them polished as much as I would like, but it's a goal for the new year!    As for the seller - NailsEtc., they were quick, got the order here by Christmas, even though it wasn't likely to get here in time, well packaged, and good prices.  HOWEVER, the shipping is outrageous.  It is better than a number of other nail polish sellers on Amazon (some charge $2-4 per bottle, no matter how many you get) but it's not worth the cheap prices if you don't get multiple bottles-but not too many.  Only a bottle or two and you pay the same or more for each bottle than a regular price seller - too many bottles and the shipping price jumps WAY up.  I say \\"bottles\\" but it is based on the amount of money you spend, not number of bottles so if you get a few expensive items, it may be a smaller package and weigh less, and technically cost much less to ship, but you actually get charged much more to ship.  BE CAREFUL, and check the shipping prices before clicking to purchase.
B004E5PJE4|5|thank you very much! they are not as thick as I thought they would have been, but I love them.
B0045MV6WU|5|Allergy to latex in elastic bound hair nets led me to these in the early '70's. Glad to find them on Amazon @ Cache Beauty. They keep hair in place and ARE truly invisible!.You forget it's there,really!
B00H6TPT90|4|GREAT
B00A9G2PJ4|5|These are the best eyedrops, Rx or non-Rx. They work better than anything over the counter or otherwise available in stores.
B0007OES3Y|5|Love these razors! Such a smooth shave. I have to admit that I would use men's razors to get a very close shave on my legs but these razors do as good of a job and at least it looks girly hanging in my shower.
B00Y23RAU4|5|Like many women in their thirties, I have the challenge of needing to fight both wrinkles and breakouts. To do so, I use a combination of prescription retinol and benzoyl peroxide products. As a result, my skin is also sensitive. I have tried so many cleansers in all price ranges, but have had a hard time finding something gentle but effective enough to remove waterproof eye makeup (not to mention foundation, concealor, blush & powder). This little cloth does the job amazingly well with just water, so there is no irritation or dryness. I honestly could not believe how  well it worked the first time and went over my face with a makeup wipe after to check the results - totally clean! Nothing on the wipe! You truly only need a little water. I am amazed!
B000J14PR4|5|Use it to crush dog medication to add to their food.. Works great!
B0018RG2VU|1|I grew up with this stuff. Made me smell so wonderful.<br />Why would Sara Lee sell out that new company and allow them to change what was the best bath soap on the market?<br />Totally stupid.
B0091KRB98|5|I fell in love with this fragrance when I was in high school&#60;3 Now that I finally found it at a decent price (after previously paying 80.00 for it at Belk's), I can honestly say I'm VERY satisfied with my purchase. I sprayed this like six hours ago, and I keep getting whiff's of it every time I move. LOVE it!
B008TNQ2DY|5|I can't say enough about these as well I love these too.<br />yes iI will buy them again keep the good work up.<br />Thank You
B005NZKTC6|2|Just junky.  Color completely off and NOT as pictured.  Sent completely wrong item. I don't really know why the message box is telling me to add more words?  Easy review here?  Didn't receive the item I expected and paid quite a bit for the one I have that cannot use..  Period.  Do you want to spend money on something you can't wear?  I did :(  Returning is a hassle.
B0032VJUX2|5|Never using another brand again!
B0015PGFQW|4|As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:<br />This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner<br />It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc<br />the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I'm sure it does not fit this case<br />Excellent product it works very good
B003ZSFJ5K|4|I have had this mirror for several yrs but ended up either blowing the bulb or transformer while travelling; always bought the same mirror to replace the ones which I have ruined. Its inexpensive, light is adequate, small enough to travel with
B007M6CTW2|5|Omg I'm completely in love with these lashes. Took exactly a month for them to get here but so worth it. They do feel a little stiff but that's what makes team easier to put on (I'm not the greatest at putting on lashes) they're not too dramatic and they're not that natural either.will def purchase again.
B0089JVDPK|5|Gets all the dirt and make-up off without drying my skin.  I also have sensitive skin and have no problems with these!
B005ORIXZS|5|This smells good and the scent lasts most of the day even between washes.. It is a lighter scent from the poppy perfume.. But that's what hand lotion is supposed to be! :)
B008QNMINA|1|I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS YET!!!!!!<br />i know i LOVE the product but i have yet to have it sent to me!!!
B00JSAE0ZE|3|As a gloss, this is nice.  I don't see much plumping, and the gloss doesn't last very long on me.  It is too expensive for what it does, so I will probably not get it again.
B00AX3YNPC|5|I've been using a corded version of the Braun Silk Epil for a few years now so I was super excited to try this cordless version. Truth be told, I haven't used the rotating brush head yet, but I LOVE the epilator! They've made so many improvements to the design since I received my last one. The unit charges pretty quickly. I didn't time it but it couldn't have been more than 20 minutes after plugging it in from completely dead that I found it fully recharged. The contour of the unit is also improved, and I love the changes to the on/off dial. It was very easy to accidentally slide the on/off switch on my older model, but this requires two fingers so you won't be accidentally turning it on or off when you don't intend to. The new contouring head is also fantastic. The older model did not pivot with the contour of your legs, but this one works perfectly. The rounded epilator head is protected by the pivoting frame so that when it meets your skin, it is always in the right position. I had jabbed myself a few times with the older model as I was getting used to it. Not painful, but annoying and not effective. It's impossible to do it wrong with this new pivoting head. Overall, I don't feel that it's less painful than previous versions (and underarm hair is still excruciating and I will not do it!) but if you keep up with it every couple of days the pain is extremely minimal. The worst will be when you've let the hair grow out for a while and then do it all at once, and even then it's bearable. I'm glad to see they removed the cold pack from this version because it never helped with the pain despite the claims that it would and the ice on my legs was more uncomfortable than the actual epilating. The weight is just right, not too heavy to fatigue your hands but not too light as to feel like you don't have precise control. And of course, my skin stays smoother longer and epilating removes a lot of the dark spots that are left behind with regular shaving of my very fair skin. Definitely worth picking up for first timers or if you have an older corded version!Definitely worth picking up for first timers or if you have an older corded version!
B004I94DF2|4|I love all the colors.  2 or 3 coats are fine.  It does chip easily if u have your hands in water a lot, so be sure to wear gloves when washing dishes.  I would buy them all again.
B0010H3VL2|5|This tanning lotion is THE BEST. If you don't get it hen you really are missing out. It gets me extremely tan in a short amount of time. :)
B000X4J360|5|He loved it works great...
B000C20P6U|5|My whole family uses this brush. It is stiff enough to go through thick hair, yet pliable enough, it doesn't scratch your scalp. It gets even better after using it for a few months.
B000YJ2SKM|3|Great for gentle cleansing. I found out it has parabens in it, and the research is clear: stay away. CeraVe, do away with the Parabens and I'll start using it again!
B003987CL0|5|This is the best razor I've ever used. I have sensitive skin, and this razor gives an amazingly close shave yet doesn't irritate the skin. It's great for shaving your head as well. I strongly recommend it.
B005CK3QQ8|5|I have used this Dental Floss for quite some time and I love it...although it is not as thin as the regular ones so it is important that you floss carefully but it works great and does not hurt...I wouldn't change it for another one...
B0018B9JKM|5|I like all Clarin's products, and these are no different.  They are clean and make my skin feel great.  I notice immediate changes if I try different products.  They have the best toner I've ever used, and their cleansers are wonderful.
B004Y0YJTU|4|This lemon essential oil is amazing! It has a wonderful full-bodied zing to it and it is of good quality. I don't think its 100% undiluted, maybe like 80% or so but I am very happy with the quality regardless.     Keep lemon essential oil away from cats, it can cause liver damage.
B00UICNOPI|5|My cat is finally accepting of my dog after using this oil as part of a flea/tick spray :) I also put a drop on one of her toys, and a couple drops in a bottle of bubbles, and she's having a blast! VERY effective in keeping ticks and flying insects away, and my cat is one happy camper! Incredibly potent, a little goes a very, very long way.
B00FZIUHL4|5|Very good!! My hair has been damaged from different products… dasgro has helped restore my hair very quickly. I am proud to show it off again! If you want a hair regrowth product that is worth the price, this is it.
B0050XG9RK|5|Great little mirror! perfect for travel and for my second bathrooms...many of my guests need magnification for contacts, etc. I have a full size counter one for my master baths.
B006EHZF8A|4|Would like more conditioning.
B004ML689A|3|This is probably the first negative review I've ever written on Amazon. I just got this steamer and I was so excited to try it. The item came brand new, however, only the cool mist works. I tried different levels of water - right at the Max line, below, above etc. When I switch the hot steam on, it just beeps 3 times and doesn't do anything. The light indicator doesn't go green like the cool mist one does. I was able to magically make it at least go green, so it would start to heat the water (and you can see the waves in the container), but just when it looks hot enough, it would automatically switch off - no hot steam whatsoever. I spent 1 hour trying to make it work. So that's enough time wasted. Unfortunately I have to return it...Very disappointed! It's probably a hit or miss with this product.<br /><br />UPDATE on Sep. 5, 2013:<br /><br />The night after I wrote the review above, I was actually able to get this steamer to work. I just shook it a little and maybe this changed something? It almost sounds like the Russian way - bang on the TV and it starts working. But it did, so I was happy. Otherwise, I was about to return it. I have used it probably 6-7 times already and so far so good. The steam is pretty strong. I keep it for 10 minutes but I think it can go even longer since there is a lot of water left after 10 min.
B00GBI590Q|5|Worked amazingly on my face. I'm African American
B0011WJ5K2|5|I have used this product for years, daily under foundation.  It is not greasy, and allows my skin to hold moisture.  As I freckle easily, this product keeps my skin even-toned and freckle free.
B0009I4MB6|2|I have very thin, fine hair and thought that the pureology products were a good idea. Unfortunately, I have found that it leaves my hair very dry and full of static.  Sorry, but I think I will go back to my tried and true Redken BodyFull line.
B009ERZGMM|1|Nothing special as far as mascara goes, and the comb is rotten.  It gets all gunked up bad design.  Run away and buy sephora brand or Rimmel with a comb!
B00HA0SN7A|4|Every lipstick except three of them, were disconnected from there bases, but with a little push they went back in. Very bold bright colors. Just what i wanted.
B00AHAWWO0|4|My wife has been using these and we can really tell the difference in how bright her teeth look. One side effect most everyone has already mentioned is your teeth will get sore. There isn't anything you can really do about it but sleep it off and usually by the next day you feel fine.<br /><br />The only downside is how expensive they are but they did work as advertised. I am not quite convinced that these do anymore than the lower tier Crest Whitening strips and may try out a cheaper package next time.
B001Z8IJSG|1|Awful, broke the first time I used it and it was old and stale
B00IIU19BS|5|works a lot better than the regular austalian gold, and i loved that product, this is just superior, and bought in a three pack, not much price difference. i like the fact it is not a bronzer, but an actual tanning lotion that can be used indoors and out, It got me a lot darker, a lot faster. and smells fantastic.
B007W4ZFSO|5|Product is great . Shipping took forever
B007HO1A9W|5|Good price, delivery was as expected, easy transaction. I purchased this product for my niece and she said she really likes it and it does what its  suppose to. She said it does get really hot.
B0001XOIY0|5|Most helpful when travelling.  Seal easily and securely.  Write info with ballpoint pen.
B00IX9EN2G|1|Dont get me wrong, the hair is of great quality and its nice and thick however...BEWARE THIS IS NOT 32&#34;/80cm IN LENGTH, it is only 22&#34; curled or if you stretch it out straight it is 24&#34; long, a good 10&#34; short than what they say. I bought this, love it but am very upset they gave me a 10&#34; short wig than described so please beware, I was told by the buyer I rcvd the correct wig, they must have the length listed incorrectly but a month later and I see not corrections to that length have been made so make sure you get some guarantee of the length first!!!
B00QU0KKUO|4|Awesome for photos
B001MS7P0W|5|I came across this shaving cream at Target. I decided to try it since it smelled great and had a lotion like consistency. I have to say I absolutely love this shaving cream! I have never used it to shave on dry skin, but I have used it plenty while in the shower and it is great. No nicks or cuts, and as someone with very dry skin, this actually moisturizes my skin leaving no irritation bumps or anything. It does clog the razor quickly, because it is so thick, but I recommend this to people with very dry skin!
B003988OM6|4|uhh bien
B0046VGPHQ|4|Love the color and the mitt. The only thing I would complain about is the spray bottle stopped working about half way through.
B002HWS9GQ|5|Great toothbrush.
B0009OAHNM|5|The '90s are gone, but I still get compliments on this cologne.  Now if mullets, tight rolled jeans and Tommy Hilfiger everything would just make a comeback...
B0069USI3G|5|Okay I first bought this item  2 months ago for my gf  after reading some very pleasing reviews.....this is my second order.......her and her friends have ran the bottle dry in less than a few weeks....its a smell unlike no other not fruity or minty....its a fresh clean smell that any mature woman will enjoy
B005ST5TIG|1|Very disappointed with this cream! It's gel-like texture is not very moisturizing... you feel good at first but a couple of hours later your skin is dry again & the perfume is so strong that it gave me a headache everytime I used it.  Buy Jergens Ultra Healing moisturizer at Target instead!!!
B00J9CRBU2|2|Nicely made, good quality item.  It is not good for exfoliating, the bristles are so soft it's like rubbing a feather on my face.
B00NB2COIU|5|I love this product! It is a must have in my house.
B00150LT40|5|Base coat with Top Nail make my manicure last longer. The toap coat is perfect for my nails. Thank you.
B000C2384Q|5|I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR 5 YEARS.I COULD NOT STOP USING IT.EVEN IM A GIRL,I USUALLY USE MEN COLOGNE.I STOPPED FOR 2 MONTHS THEN USED OTHER ONES ,BUT WHEN I CAME BACK I KNOW I HAVENT EVER GET ANYTHING ELSE THAT MAKES ME GET THE FEELING LIKE THIS.I ALWAYS GET THE 3.4OZ FOR MYSELF.MY FRIENDS TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY SMELL TOMMY THEY KNOW ITS ME.
B00GQI67KW|5|I am a HUGE fan of Designer Skin, nothing I've tried compares.  They excel where my poor white skin cannot!  I have used Luminary, Black Tan Extender, Luminary for face, Tiny Bubbles, and now Glam Slam.  Not only does it work fantastic, but the SMELL IS HEAVENLY!  This is the first tanning lotion with DHA that I have EVER used that had no ATO!!!  You smell like kiwi, melon, and banana!  It is delicious!!!  I could literally eat my arm when I put in on, lol.  I must say, the best ATO inhibitor I have experienced yet, and if you are like me and run from the tanning bed to work or school, you will thank yourself for this purchase!  I paid $66 at the salon!  I also love Adore, the only tanning lotion without DHA that I have used that has actually shown color on me after 1 visit in the tanning bed!  Tiny Bubbles...you won't want to get out of the bath!  It also smells amazing! I was skeptical about effectiveness, but I have extremely dry skin, and this stuff leaves me more moisturized after a shower than anything else I've used, and you skin seems to glow from the Opti-Glow complex.  I don't know how it works, but it does!  I buy only Designer Skin, regardless of whether you want a bronzer, no bronzer, DHA and Erythrulose, or neither,black walnut seed extract, ATO inhibitors, etc....you cannot enjoy a product more than their silicone emulsions.  If you are a hot-natured person who sweats like I do, summer or not, you want this kind of blend!  It goes on like silk and disappears into your skin, no stickiness, no afterfeel, no odor.  This is the only line I will buy!
B000ZJJA0M|5|I have sensitive skin & allergies & used this product for over 10 years. When I use it my complexion looks brighter & hydrated. I always follow it with aromatherapy sensitive skin oil. Very highly recommend.
B00GR6OUYS|1|Didn't help my psoriasis at all
B0068OF1QU|5|Great product
B00K5LL6H0|5|Great gift.  Beautiful colors!
B0000532VC|4|I used these while in the hospital and then at home and they are nice and thick and fairly damp (though not wet). I did not detect any bad or 'medicinal' odor, which others complained of. However, they are smaller (albeit thicker) than Simply Right Adult Washcloths and seem to leave a slight residue. I still use these for more thorough cleaning, and the Simply Right ones for daily use. They both have their advantages and alternating helps cut the costs since these are pricier.
B0038BF0J4|2|Not authentic.
B0046AAVR2|5|Outstanding!  Best I have used in 65 years of brushing.  Wish I had purchased years ago. My wife agrees with me on this evaluation.
B004FEKA3E|3|I gave this 3 stars because I loved it when I purchased it from the salon, which was over priced of course, so I bought it here at a much cheaper price! and I loved that. the lotion smells great and does give you a good color. only problem I had with ordering from here is that it left me with an itchy rash after every use. which I wasn't experiencing with the same lotion purchased in the salon. I don't know if I suddenly became allergic to whats in this lotion or it was just a bad batch. im wondering if anyone else has had this problem?
B001MA0QY2|5|❤️ It.
B00RJCVBHI|5|i love these headbands! I have long hair and can't stand it iny face. These headbands are my favorite style. They are stable, wisps of hair don't escape, and they don't dig in and hurt as many other plastic headbands do. I was glad to buy them in quantity as well
B000P1TYEM|5|Very good toothpicks
B00194BK78|5|A little goes a long way.  Lasts all day.  I've ridden 10-12 hours without a reapplication.  Sweating doesn't thin it out.  Put it on too thick and you'll look like Frosty the Snowman.
B00243FKM4|5|I am also disappointed with my product, because the bottle is leaking. Don't get me wrong, I love the product itself. But not a leaking one. Amazon did reimburse me for the defect though.
B0035AT4MC|5|After trying several other hair detangler products, we decided to try this on a recommendation from my granddaughter's hair stylist.  It is wonderful!  No more tangles.
B00JWQRW0E|5|Loving my Lavender Lotion!
B000JL1KGI|5|This stuff has a nice leathery scent that is not overpowering.It does not smell like a cheap cologne. You can't go wrong, especially at this price. I bought 2 and my wife suggests I get more.
B00H7HV3YQ|5|I loved these! I loved the assortment of colors, and they are super easy to apply. The colors were super bright and stayed that way until I washed them out. Definitely recommend!
B005OSQGN8|3|The mirror pops off the mount WAY too easily.  I bought it for my husband for Father's Day, he seems to like it, but every time he goes to squeegee it off after his shower, it pops off the mount and totally irritates him.  It's a shame, because it's an otherwise great product.  If you can live with it jumping off the wall, go for it.  It's good size, lights up well, does the trick, but that's a major flaw that the manufacturers need to adress in future design.
B003YTWP7A|1|ZERO STARS AND NEGATIVE IF I COULD! This is NOT a Bare Escentuals product but a poorly disguised knock off.  You can see that in the picture they don't show you the top of the product.  There is a reason for that people!  It doesn't have the signature Bare Escentuals or i.d. inscription on top! Waste of my money and of my time now that I have to go through the hassle of returning the product, ordering a legitimate one and writing this review to notify others.  Boo and hiss!
B004N0ULSO|5|This product, OPI Black Shatter, was given to my daughter, Janie as a gift.  Janie has used it and is very impressed with it!  Wonderful!  I do not regret purchasing this item for her.  No hidden qualities.
B003XU8ABA|5|It's awsome
B00GTV75L6|4|I purchased this lotion because of surprising low the price was especially compared to other tanning lotions. I have tried other tingle lotions in the past and this one is probably my favorite because most tingle lotions cause an overwhelming heat sensation. this lotion has just the right amount of tingle, it is not uncomfortable hot, but it still does what a tingle lotion is meant to do. I also loved the smell of the lotion, it is not offensively strong, just light and fresh. it also does not have an bad &#34;after-tan&#34; smell. the consistency of the lotion is smooth and not greasy. the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I would have liked it to have more of a bronze color to the lotion. I is still one of my favorite affordable tanning lotions
B003MJ7Z0O|5|I opened this product, tried it on and really like it. It didn't smell funny, it looked pure, and I could feel it working. So far my skin is looking better and better every day. I recommend this product and will be buying it again. Awesome experience!!!
B002UUT450|3|The consistency of the lotion is not the same you buy on the shelf in the store which leads me to believe that these are seconds on the production line. I would not but this product on Amazon again. The price difference isn't worth the difference at Wal-Mart which seems to have good pricing on such products.
B00LWFK034|5|Love the smell
B000WSV83I|5|Good toothpaste - I guess this was a 3 pkg offer so I will have a supply for months. Taste has a slight mint.<br /><br />Read about benefits of Tea Tree oil (Melaleuca) online.<br /><br />Complementary and alternative medicines such as tea tree (Melaleuca) oil have become increasingly popular in recent decades. This essential oil has been used for almost 100 years in Australia. The primary uses of tea tree oil have historically capitalized on the antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions, antimicrobial.<br /><br />Many dental care experts advocate brush and floss your teeth twice a day.<br /><br />As with ALL products read label and instructions before using<br />Always rinse well after using the toothpaste (just like all toothpaste- rinse well).
B00OP21VU2|5|I love the new #VidalSassoon Salonist hair color. This is the color that I used. My hair was so drab, it looked dirty every day. I used this product and my hair is soft, more manageable and looks great. The color was beautiful. I have well water and it turns my hair orange, I hate the effects that the well water has on my hair. This Permanent hair color was a two step process. It started with the roots and then treated the length. I have really long thick hair and I didn't think there would be enough product in this box, but there was and it had great coverage. I had never used anything from this company before, but from now on it will be the brand that I look for. I received this product free in exchange for an honest review. I have tried many other brands but this one stands out. The box is classy and doesn't look like all the rest.  #Sponsored #VidalSassoon #Salonist
B00LICKHOS|5|Great brush at 1/2 the price. I normally use Bare Minerals brushes, but after seeing this brush decided to try it. It's as good as Bare Minerals, much softer and much cheaper. Love it!
B006RHI1JM|5|I've always had fine/thin hair, and after having surgery under general anesthesia, I lost so much of it that patches of my scalp were visible. Apparently hair loss is common with anesthesia. I was recommended a chemical brand for repair, however I wanted a more natural option. I am quite happy with this product and plan to buy it again. I thought it would be more oily - but the consistency is closer to water - which means it works perfectly in the morning before blow-drying. My hair feels thicker and stronger and looks fuller.
B004FEKA3E|5|you do get a great tan. no doubt
B000FYXTDQ|5|I just got this so I haven't used it or abused it so I can't speak to its wear or long term durability. However I can say it's the perfect size and the feel is great.  I wanted leather at first but it's just not worth it any more.  This is perfect! love it!
B00GAT5D5C|4|This was my first purchase from this company, and the quality of the hair is among the nicest I've gotten anywhere. It's thick all the way to the ends, and true to length--which has been hard for me to find. The main hitch with this order is that it was advertised as Medium Dark Brown...not any hint of red, and their photo of them is clearly dark brown...but as you can see from the photo I've attached, what I received is definitely more auburn in tone. I don't like dying extensions to match because it seems like that rinses out whatever it is they put in them that makes them glossy and silky, and they don't last as long. And though I haven't yet used them, there are more loose hairs than I'm used to seeing--seems like they may not be sewn quite as tight as some wefts. So that's why I docked a star. But if the color had been Medium Dark Brown, I'd have given this 5 stars and been totally thrilled. I will probably try them again because of the value for product.
B00563K6VO|5|This glove does exactly what it's supposed to do. It protected my hand from the heat of my curling iron.
B006FXK1QY|1|I unfortunately discovered that this attractive rosewood/stone incense holder is useless for its intended purpose of adequately holding incense sticks.  The four provided holes for the incense sticks are not drilled deep enough.  The incense sticks were very loose in the holes and wobbled and leaned far to one side or the other instead of standing straight up as they should have.  As the center material of the holder that comprises the part that actually holds the incense stick is made of stone, it is impossible to increase the depth of the holes.  I attempted to do so with a very thin nail and hammer.  The end result of this attempt was that the stone center of the incense holder shattered as though it was made of glass.  I do not recommend this product!
B000EBFJXS|1|I'm really baffled by how many good reviews there are for this product.  Oh well, all I can do is relate my own experience, and that is that this product is a complete waste.  It just flat out doesn't work (well).  I'm not sure whether it's that the blade isn't sharp enough or long enough, of just that it is poorly designed and conceived.  Whatever.  Time to move on to another product.<br /><br />Note: I recently bought the Panasonic ER421KC and like it MUCH better.  It just eliminates hair much much more effectively.  It costs a little more, but boy is it worth it.
B000YB89AS|3|The lashes are a bit too spacious. I really like the looks of the 600s more but these aren't bad
B001EJOPZC|4|The handle makes it easier to use the BufPuf sponge on hard to reach places like my back and feet, especially after surgery left me temporarily less flexible.  It is nice to be able to use either side of the BufPuf but switching on the handle  is a little bit of a drawback
B007WS0UP8|5|Best one I've ever found. love that it's tented.
B00LFT0CGM|5|I usually never write reviews but this product is amazing! I recently had a major breakout due to stress and the acne stayed even after the stress went away. I tried everything but nothing seemed to work till I tried this. It has been amazing. I use it with almond oil nightly after I wash my face with mild soap. The smell is strong so I don't use it in the morning but you could to do a spot treatment. My mom and I both use this product now and we have never been happier with any product. It really does work and works fast. I have yet to try their other products but if it is as good as this one I'm sure it will be a good choice.
B00H4C6L2I|5|this is a little known substance that is great for your skin;  glycerin is a humectant.  it holds the moisture on your skin.  i mix this with rosewater and my skin is doing great.
B000KQ9WMQ|5|excellent product
B00KN17H0M|1|I used the coffee scrub for two weeks. In those two weeks it made my face really sensitive and sore. No longer using the product and my face has went back to normal.
B00B6SHU4E|5|I received my shears faster than they had said they would ship, so I am very happy with that. I haven't had a chance to use them yet but they do seem to be perfect non the less. Can't wait to use them
B00161DDN8|5|I received Smashbox's Bionic Mascara in Jet Black as a free gift at Sephora a while back. I fell in love with this mascara! It doesn't clump, it lengthens my lashes giving them a natural look with 1 coat but can easily go nighttime with additional coats and best of all it doesn't flake. I would definitely recommend this product for those looking for a great lengthening mascara.
B000NRAUPK|5|Very good. It last long
B0013TTR4M|5|Product is as described.  Packaging could have been better because the tube was squashed.
B00EOAZZYS|4|I was very skeptical about an all natural deodarant and how well it would work in extremelly hot and humid days.  I was pleasantly surprised that it holds up great, maybe even better than traditional deodarant.  After a full day's for work and an intense gym sessions during an 85 degree hunmid day, this deodorant passed the test with flying colors.  The reason why it gets 4 stars instread of 5 is the price.  It is kind of steep for just one ounce.
B000XE15VG|5|I love this scent on a guy. I love the adidas brand colognes in general I use the womens perfume and usually buy this cologne for all my guy friends so I can smell it constantly...
B00BHM1TDM|4|Ordered this to replace my first, very old PM Sculpting Brush.  It's very similar but still prefer the original and suppose that's because I am just comfortable with the feel of the first brush.  Will switch to the new model permanently when all the little round tips on the first brush have vanished!  I only use this brush on dry hair, not for blowing out just-shampooed, towel-damp hair.  Still would recommend this brush to anyone who needs a good all-purpose brush, although I don't have long hair or particularly thick hair.  It feels great on your scalp and has never damaged my hair or gotten tangled up in my hair, even when brushing out my hair after using a lot of styling product.  It works for me!
B001MA0QY2|5|Best flat iron my wife has used up to this point.
B002HWS9FW|5|My teeth feel much cleaner and I hope to have good news the next time I go to the dentist!
B002WTC38O|5|It really works. After one week of applying the product, I noticed both my eyebrows and eyelashes grows. I'm really happy to find something that can save my eyebrows.
B003M1GJ5Y|5|This is an excellent product at a very good price.  It works on fine and coarse hair.  I will be buying another one soon because my daughter wants to take the one we share to college with her when she goes next year.
B00HMEBRKO|4|My husband thought these worked well but the only downfall is that he had to disassemble the head to clean the blades as compared to the single edge razors.
B000TAE0RK|5|It makes your skin soooo clear and it smells so good.  The smell is like a fresh, natural, clean smell.  I have never felt so clean than I have when using this soap.  I definitely recommend it.
B00FVZA9PA|5|Best brushes ever.
B00DODX2W8|5|This is my favorite shade of lipstick, and I wear it year round. I don't like to wear heavy makeup, and this color is very natural. It provides just enough color to make me look polished, so I wear it with everything from shorts to suits.
B006WZ9XVY|5|I like this lipstick a lot. Especially when I am in a mood for a change that stands out. I suggest wearing light eye make up with it. I also enjoy the smell.
B003V265QW|5|I first saw a curling wand of this type on QVC by a different retailer at a much higher price.  I am a product and styling junkie so I wanted to try this at a reasonable cost to see if it was all the hype like the demo on TV.  I love this.  Yes it takes some getting use to..and I am by no means perfect at it yet but it gave my relaxed hair a nice loose wavy look.  I fingered through my curls instead of combing them out and I love this naturally wavy look.  I read some of the other reviews and I agree that the glove does not really work but gets in the way.  I was initially afraid to try this at a really high heat but I'm going to try it again tonight at the highest to see what a difference it makes in the curls I get.  I had a hard time curling the back of my hair without picking up portions of my hair I was not curling.  Takes some time but no doubt that there is no reason to purchase one at $100 plus when this pink guy is available.  I will continue to practice when I am not in a rush.  Going out for Valentines day this weekend so I intend to use it with great success.  Buy this one if you are on the fence.  You won't be sorry!!!!
B001KUWGNI|5|This product works well and the chai tea has a spicy,warm scent that stays all day. Naked Bee makes an entire line of products that have shown to be reliable and of the highest quality.
B003T18TE6|5|I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner! First, it smells AMAZING. it's a unique, tropical smell that I adore. Second, it leaves my hair SO SOFT. I have used countless hair shampoos/conditioners/other products and I feel like this one had the biggest effect on my hair. Also my sister uses it and she has different hair than I do, and she loves it as well! Overall an excellent product and worth the price. I have had it for 2 months and I still have almost half the bottle left! Very awesome
B00006IV44|5|I've been using the Remington FaceSaver for several years, ever since I switched to an electric shaver. The powder makes shaving much more comfortable. The only down side is it's a little messy, but it's well worth it.
B004SIQRG6|5|The feather arrived missing one piece, contacted seller and sent the replacement   very fast, highly recommended. Feather extension itself is beautiful with bright  color, nice looking and exactly what my daughter wants.
B0056GDG90|4|This product is very easy to use even for hair dummies like me. My hair looks like it does when I leave the salon. Just make sure that your hair is not too wet when you use it or the style will not take.
B001O4KIZI|5|It really does work great at relieving pain, and is way better than the stuff you can buy in the store.
B00ARF44P0|1|delivery wasn't properly labelled - my name ad surname was absent - caused massive confusion - experience was POOR!!!
B001ELX290|5|This product works just like it says it will, I put it on my problem area (bikini area) and works like a charm, no more bumps or redness!
B000EHY5YQ|3|I have long thick eyebrows, so none of the stencils really fit me. Either too wide or too narrow. But they were all too short. Plus it's kind of tricky to do my left eyebrow (I'm right handed). I think I will still have to have them professionally done when I have special occasions, but I will try to maintain my shape in between visits using this product. The shadow & highlighter pencil are nice. Overall: Too expensive.
B00006IV41|5|Works great!
B00A8WQKAO|5|The colors are bold and lovely and They seem to wear really well for me. Granted I haven't tried all the colors but the ones I have were long wearing and well pigmented. It was packaged great and there were no broken eyeshadows. I was concerned when I read reviews but honestly I am very pleased with them.
B0014C8COY|4|This is the best sunscreen I use it everyday not greasy feeling no white mask.
B001TP0A5A|5|LOOVE THIS WILL BUY AGAIN
B00ELJRMZM|5|My daughter loved it!
B00AYR8BK0|4|Hair feels nice. neck has slight damage at the end. When arrived covered is some sugar looking substance that had to be wiped off.  Other than that is good for my daughter.
B002ZNJI9O|3|I purchased 2 of this manikin & 1 of another kind. This one was disappointing to my girls because it was so different from their hair texture that it was difficult to manage. It's okay because we can donate them to cosmetology students or they can practice hair cuts, but making braids & styling was a problem for us.
B006I8KLRU|4|This is my first purchase from Sigma, and so far I'm overall happy with these brushes. I love the colors, and the brushes are very soft. However, the duo fibre brush is a little sparse, and I wish this kit had a short shader and a kabuki.
B006HCJXBM|4|These are great! The price is unbeatable for what you get. They glide on smoothly and last all day. The colors are very vivid. I have very fair skin and I've had to tone down a few of the darker colors to keep them from looking too gawdy. Overall, I'm very happy with them and will likely buy more when I run out.
B00363H2JA|5|Although it has an odd scent, it goes on nicely and I've had many compliments on the color....Also dries quickly.....Would definitely recommend!!
B000I6N8AK|5|I love this wig stand it is wonderful and perfect for my needs.I was given one at a beauty supply store.I asked to buy some (they were thrown in a box)I was told No, but that I could have one since I purchased a wig.Well I thought she (the wig head)was beautiful.I make Headwraps and jewelry-this would work perfectly! So I ordered several, recieved them today,They look better than my free one (she's a little banged up)However she is of better quality but not as smooth. The mold line is high-But I simply removed it with a nail file.I am very satisfied and it is an upgrade from the regular styro wig heads.
B00LI0ZJZW|5|A really good bargain...bags are a nice bonus, and ALL of the products are winners.
B00406ZI3E|5|I've been using this cream for about a year now - goes on smooth and grease free - best of all it keeps me rosacea and sunburn free.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Extra gentle - Even if you're sunburned or your nose is red and painful from a cold - Neocutis goes on smooth and pain-free and since it's a post-surgery creme, it helps reduce the redness and the burn away rather quickly.<br />- Helped keep my rosacea in check - I suffer from sun-triggered rosacea, so every time I travel to tropical climes, or when the weather warms up, my skin freaks out (my cheeks look like orange peels). This year however, even after the blazing Cambodian sun, I managed to survive with just a light bit of bumpiness (but no itching or redness) on my forehead, but no full blown outbreak or sunburn for that matter. I do admit that I was using the cream multiple times during the evenings after I had washed off the sunscreen and sweat.<br /><br />Cons<br />Yes it's expensive - but to not have to suffer through days of itching, redness and just looking miserable - I'd say well worth it.
B00GRFNB4O|5|My hairdresser suggested it because I am swimming in a pool that has chlorine which was making a mess of my hair.  Really helps.
B001DI776S|5|This stuff is awesome. After using Dr. Bronners I'll never purchase another brand of soap again. Period.
B00BONE8R8|4|Very good
B002RBF1PO|4|I bought this after read the positive reviews and figured it would be a good backup to my Merkur.  It's a nice razor to use.  Well balanced, handle is textured to give a good grip with wet hands.  Not to aggressive but it gets the job done nicely.  For the price I was surprised how well constructed it was and how nice the chroming was.
B003E112KE|4|product is okay for fine hair but not perfect. but give it a try and see how you like it...it is worth that
B0028MFH2O|2|I purchased this iron in March of 2014. The iron stopped working this week less than a year in service. I used this iron about 3 times each week. I have had irons last many years prior to this product. When it worked, it did as good as previous irons. Unfortunately, 11 months is not long enough to justify a better review. I would not recommend buying this iron
B005TKZS76|5|I was so amazed by these brushes. I have most of the Eco tools  brushes but I didn't have these. They work so nicely and blend great. It came even quicker then I expected. So amazing!!!!
B009XPRZJW|5|Really helped
B009DHNXNM|5|Purchased as a gift .
B001DBBC84|5|My niece is absolutely thrilled with this product and used it ASAP on Christmas morning . She is elated and says that it works great !
B00ON1HPIC|5|✫¸.•°*”˜˜”*°•. ¸✫ A little goes along way ✫¸.•°*”˜˜”*°•. ¸✫
B0058PRZJ6|5|Great bags! I'm not a professional but I am an addict. I have a lot of makeup and I travel for work so with this I'm happy to have my collection with me and keep it organized.
B003KLVMOO|4|this is a great natural mascara--does not irritate my eyes whatsoever and does not really flake at all during the day time. I have received compliments on how nice my lashes look---even though I did not buy this product for any dramatic effect! I also love the brush--its big and fluffy.<br />My only complaint is that the formula dries pretty quickly in the bottle--the first 2 weeks it applied very nicely, but now it's slightly difficult to apply evenly because the formula is drier.<br />I don't know if my lashes are any longer because of this product--I don't wear mascara everyday anyways. But the fact that it has good, sensitive, hair loving ingredients is a plus for me compared to other mascaras filled with chemicals that are not beneficial in any way.<br />Not sure if I will repurchase this item for now, but I do like it. I tend to buy different mascaras each time anyways.
B004AI4YAK|5|:)
B0052IG7G6|5|I purchased a bottle a little more than a month ago from Nippon-Store out of curiosity. I've heard great things from this sunscreen and wanted to see if it's what I've been searching for a long time. I've confirmed it's the holy grail of sunscreen!! At least for me. I have oily skin and this sunscreen is just perfect. It dries for a matte finish almost instantly but it may be too drying for those with dry skin or perhaps even normal. There is no greasy feeling or any feeling that I'm wearing any sunscreen at all! It's extremely water proof so it's a chore to remove but totally worth it. Have purchased two more bottles as I cannot run out of supply. I need this!
B00ARF42H0|4|Works well.  It cost a little bit more than a trimmer operated by a single AA battery but it has much more power.  The attachments are all useful.  It's a little difficult to set the length when using the guards but it appears to be secure and reproducible.  I've reached an age where hair appears in places I never imagined hair could grow.  I hate to admit needing a device like this, but there it is.<br /><br />Cons:  Can't use it on ac power when the batteries are dead.  The charger doesn't shut off automatically.  It doesn't have a case so I dug up a small drawer bin we had around the house to hold the trimmer and attachments.  At this price I'm willing to make sacrifices.
B00B8Z2LRQ|5|I have used this before when I had a problem with my nails. I've always had pretty nails, but as I got older my nails became brittle and split all the time. This product is for real. My nails started growing again after using this.
B00COGWNNK|5|Cute headband
B001FYUZAU|5|One of the best products out there to help with ingrown hair. Very gentle and light scent. Awsome  for all.
B00D0NP5E0|4|really in love with the &#34;cloud nine&#34; shade, light purple indoors and then holographic in the sun! only thing is it chipped after a week
B0008E8KC8|5|This is my favorite brand of massage creme. Hands down (pun intended).  It lasts a long time once applied and has a great smell.
B000KHMPOW|4|I bruise easily and am always finding bruises on my legs, even when I don't remember bumping into anything!<br /><br />My newest, and most successful routine for day-old bruises is<br /><br />Rub the Vitamin K Cream on the bruise<br />Apply heating pad for about 15 minutes<br />Remove pad and massage area gently for a few minutes while the area is warm.<br />Re-apply heating pad for 15 minutes<br />Repeat massage<br /><br />I do this while watching TV at night for about a hour and the next day the bruise is noticeably lighter.<br /><br />If I do this two nights in a row, it's even better.<br /><br />I've also starting taking Vitamin K supplements and extra Vitamin C, and to be honest, I'm not sure which part is the most helpful, but together it's all working! That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. ;)
B00PMQAWMI|5|light weight and easy on my long hair
B00B2EBL2Y|5|This wig is amazing!! The pictures do not give it justice &#60;3 I adore it. Very very comfortable. The wig cap was easy to figure out. It is my first ever. My friend who is a seasoned cosplayer loves it and was shocked when I told her how little I payed for it. I can not wit to use it for my Lolita Harley Quinn Cosplay. This is my first Con ever and first time cosplaying so I really want to do well. I am sure it will be a hit now &#60;3
B0046TU86C|4|It kept my hair spiked all day and wasn't too hard at all. It works great, will definitely buy again.
B0017JR3IA|3|I have bought products of this brand before and I have never been disappointed.... However, this perfume is not good....  shortly lasting, incoherent accent...
B001DJ2V0E|5|Been using this for years and hope they don't discontinue it.  The best.hold without a sticky feeling especially in high humidity.
B00JH0CHW8|5|Love it. Works well.
B00J2CJGQ6|5|I'm 34 years old and I've always had problems with my skin (mild acne, blackheads). I started using the HydroPeptide products after I had a facial at a spa, and loved how my skin felt afterwards. I use the cleanse, toner, solar defense, serum, and occasionally the Anti-Wrinkle Polishing Crystals Plus Anti-Wrinkle Plumping Activator. The little bumps I had along my chin line are completely gone and have not returned. My skin has never been so clear. The only makeup I wear now is a tinted moisturizer (guerlain bb cream), and blush.
B000JL7WQK|5|Worked as expected
B002XHL58E|4|Good color,not too light, feels nice, has a nice sheen, tastes and smells good too, though not overpowering.<br />Does not last if eating or drinking, but I don't mind reapplying.
B002N5MI1Y|5|Has a  good smell.  Does not make you hair too greasy.  Gives you good control, and a nice look.  I like it.
B00TAAX69S|5|This mask is great!!! My hair is quite thick and dry and tends to get frizzy easily. This mask (and I've tried EVERYTHING) was great to tame the frizz and left my hair smooth and easy to manage. Gives amazing shine, but is lightweight enough to use a couple of times a week. The smell is amazing as well.... would definitely purchase again.
B004XJIVAU|3|I like Nivea deodorants because they are long lasting; they last the 48 hours that they claim. What I don't like about this particular one and (the whitening) version I had before it that it leaves my underarms dry and itchy.
B00070E8LA|5|Outstanding cut. quick delivery.
B007P5AJV8|5|My wife is constantly bothered by mosquitos and other biting insects.  So, my nephew brought Skedattle to the lake where we spent a week and sprayed it around.  We sat out around a campfire most of the night, singing and listening to music and my wife was not bitten once.  When we got home I ordered a bottle and can tell you we'll definitely keep this product on hand.  We travel a lot with our RV and like the outdoors and this product will definitely let us stay out longer.  Thanks for an excellent product.
B000JNQSIQ|5|Great tool.
B0053L2E1O|4|This soap is great!  I use it for my face, body, & hair.  I no longer need a moisturizer for my face and it does not dry out my skin.
B00EJSONGG|5|After only 10 days, the texture of the skin around the eyes has softened and the fine lines are slowly going away. It's good to see a product that finally works especially after spending so much on products that made my skin red and flaky. The only con for me is the price of the serum and being that I use it twice a day will mean I have to buy again in a week or so or reduce usage. That said, it is a wonderful product and if you want results, ASAP, purchase this serum!
B009B6RAIO|1|I'm very upset with the delivery of this product!<br />Travel Cosmetic Bag Assorted Color Zipper Coin Purse Multi Purpose (Pink)<br />This product was sent to my house and the zipper on it was so obviously BROKEN! I can not believe this was sent to me in these conditions!<br />I will NEVER order something that has to ship from Hong Kong EVER again!!!!!
B00FG87DF6|5|I love all Guerlain perfumes with the exception of Shalimar, which I like, but it isn't exactly &#34;right&#34; for me.  But this one -- Wow!  A really beautiful, musky, exotic scent.  Wish I could buy a whole bottle of it here in the U.S., but I don't think it's available here yet.  And it's really expensive too.  I found this because I was looking for a fragrance similar to Bonne Bell Ambergris Oil, which sold in the 70s.  It doesn't smell exactly like that, but it's very sexy and &#34;animal.&#34;  I only have the fragrance samples, so I'm saving them for a special occasion!
B0055EC8II|5|Love this!
B000KQ1E5Y|5|If you want high quality skincare, look no further.  This is the product line to buy.  I love this facewash.  Tried a cream one from Eminence before this, I like this one MUCH better.  I don't feel like it &#34;evens&#34; my skin tone at all, but it definitely helps break outs.
B009UYDOUK|4|I feel like it give brightness to my skin after using it, I like it
B0039UTO3M|5|this is my favorite Mascara i always use it, i hightly recomend it !
B000EN5IFK|5|I have had \\"problem skin\\" for many years. This makeup will cover blemishes and conceal scars w/o heavy makeup. The skin reveruper helps prevent like a miricle. The packageing is quality as well as the brushes. A starter kit will last 6 months, and you can buy a smaller kit on Sephora or QVC if you want to try a $25 starter. YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT
B008AIORMQ|5|love it even it doesn't stay long time
B000KQ73AY|5|This product works wonders on my frizzy and fly away hair.  I use a small amount daily after each shampoo.
B000C1Z8L8|5|My son loves this cologne, it has a fresh smell and when he wears you can smell it through out the house
B00K7PO996|1|Not happy,  it didn't perform for me as stated.
B008U1Q4DI|5|I got the gems today and they came early I have worn these all day and they are still on I will recommend and order again
B0030ZRQQ8|5|I ordered the ANSR after looking at reviews for effectiveness and reliability of the units. This unit had high ratings for both as well as a cost much less than other products out there. I decided to try light therapy after suffering for over a year with hormonal related acne after ceasing to take the birth control pill. I tried Clarasonic with expensive acne cleanser/treatment regimes (my insurance won't cover retin A which has worked for me in the past), essential oils, supplements/herbs, and progesterone creams, all with some improvement, but still no full control over cycle related outbreaks mostly to my neck/chin/lower cheek areas. After just over 2 weeks of using mainly just the blue 5 minute treatment only once a day, I saw great improvements. I am sure if I could use it twice a day as recommended, it would be even better. This is the first thing I have tried in the last year that has shown significant reduction over my monthly cycle, so I am happy and optimistic the results will sustain. I continue to use this in conjunction with my Clarasonic and sulfur based acne spot treatment, skinceuticals LHA regime, and essential oils (tea tree/lavendar/oregano) to keep my acne at bay and to maintain my healthy skin. I am 44 and am told I look 30 and I plan to keep it that way. The price of this product is a fraction of salon/dermatologist treatments and it can be used in your own home. It is definitely worth a try for those of you suffering from any type of acne.
B004SXTF38|5|Its hard to tell on the internet just what color your going to get, but this one is beautiful. Its a bright hot pink with a little purple irradescense to it. You wil be pleased.
B00DW5YHUY|5|Love this shampoo!! It's especially great for taming and moisturizing sometimes-frizzy hair like mine; and it has a lovely (not overpowering) scent!
B001IJ4KWQ|5|(This review is written by Alastair's wife) Watch out,Kinerase. I won't be paying $80 USD for your product any longer. Even though the active ingredients in this Neutrogena product is/are different from Kinerase's, they accomplish the same thing. I decided to try this because I saw my sister for the first time in a couple of years. She has always had problem skin--sensitive, uneven, blotchy, clogged pores, etc. I had stopped using my Kinerase because my budget is too tight now for expensive skin products. When I saw my sister this visit, I couldn't believe it--her skin looks amazing! When she told me it was because of this Neutrogena product, I hustled out to buy some at around $13 USD for the tube. Within two days I could see my skin going back to the smooth glow I used to get from Kinerase. Wow. No kidding--this stuff really works, and fast. I'm in my mid-fifties, fyi.
B004KXKG20|4|I love the scent....for me.  I have trouble finding a cologne that doesn't turn \\"bitter\\" or \\"too citrusy\\" on me.  This one is perfect and will probably be my signature scent.  I only wish there was lotion available so that I could layer.  I've noticed that the scent has really, really faded by the end of the day.
B0009HJBPE|3|The product is okay, but pricey.  There are other products which do the same thing at a better price.  I'm sure one pays for the Yves Saint Laurent name.
B004JUWBLS|5|Great brush for even the non tangled hair. My hair is very fine with a little curl, and it does a nice job making it smooth and even when I pull it back.
B00QSI0VFC|5|Very pleased with this product. The recent cold weather has been especially harsh to my already dry, sensitive skin, but the soap has been able to keep my skin smooth and hydrated longer than my usual brand of soap. And I do appreciate the natural ingredients. I highly recommend.
B0049CYN3A|3|Worse makeup ever created. Certainly it applies 'cool' but doesn't give coverage. And the &#34;buff&#34; colour is quite dark - I'll just end up cutting this foundation powder with another powder and hopefully that'll work.
B001BKVY7Q|5|I love this product, and I've been trying a lot of lotions etc. lately. This product more than any other makes my face feel like happy skin to be in! I'll finally get the same item for my next order. Whew!
B008I2IKPE|4|I love this antiperspirant/deodorant.  Keeps me dry and works hard in the tropical climate. It also blends well with my perfumes/body sprays. I buy in twin packs because I don't like to run out of deodorant (&#34;,)
B002E76KUG|5|WAS EXCATLY WHAT MY WIFE WANTED
B0032ZQJ1E|5|I love these eye gel frownies. I was quite amazed to see how they smoothed and brightened the area under my eyes. I went right to their site and see that these can also be used on the eyelids. I plan to try that. Even tho they are reusable, they are still a bit expensive, but they do work.<br /><br />I also tried the other frownies, the ones made of paper with the adhesive side. I place one between my eyes at night and they definitely do smooth out the lines there.<br /><br />I didn't expect to find these as effective as they are and I would definitely recommend them.
B004L4EING|4|I bought this item about 6 months ago, and have used it since. Only complaint is that the hairs on the brush kept falling out, at first a lot, but now not so much. There are still plenty and seems to have stopped happening. Do all brushes do that? The shaving cream, container and stand are all great. I'm now trying to find more cream.
B001H5Z9GW|5|Great stuff! I am allergic to most deodorants but this was not a problem!
B00CC04Y3U|5|This product really works!  Leaves hair full, healthy,  and soft.  I live in the Caribbean and go to the beach most mornings.  I need a good moisturizing shampoo for natural hair.
B001PTLGWG|5|This is the very best eye cream I have ever tried. noticed difference in 3 days!! I will definitely continue to use this amazing product
B0056BT8VK|5|I love this powder: it has a wonderful layering quality for better coverage on my \\"blotchy\\" days! It's a tiny bit light, and I do have to sometimes combine it with the Fair version for an absolutely non-detectable shade, but it's terrific to have. It's a bit hard to find though, so keep trying!
B007FJXKUQ|4|The caddy looks and feels like decent quality. It's a pretty simple design but will do the job.  The instructions make no sense and I thought they were pretty funny so I posted them. That's why I give it 4 stars.
B0080EEMCA|5|I have a very sensitive, acne-prone skin.<br />I've tried using various hypoallergenic and biological brands, but most of them all left me with a red, itchy burning face, or simply didn't hydrate the way they should.<br /><br />FEEL<br />This feels very light, and cools your skin down immediately the first few minutes after applying.<br />The smell isn't too strong and doesn't bother my skin. (Wouldn't knwo if it actually has perfume in it.)<br /><br />EFFECT<br />This product actually works for me.<br />It makes my face feel hydrated and smooth.<br />I also have the impression it improves the equality of your skin colour, as for me it did, and I even got commented on it.<br /><br />PRICE<br />The product works wonderfully, and the price is just great.<br />The container has enough in it to last months, if not maybe even a year as not much gel is needed to have a moisturizing effect.<br /><br />USAGE<br />I use this twice a day and it is very easy to apply.<br />After a few minutes the gel sinked into my skin.<br />It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky, looking shiny or greasy.<br />And I can go out without a red, irritated itching face!<br /><br />DELIVERY<br />I ordered this product from BeautyNetkorea.<br />I thoroughly recommend this seller!<br /><br />The packaging was very neat.<br />Free samples of various brands were included.<br />(In my case Lotions, Cream and BB Cream samples)<br />Shipping was reasonably fast.<br /><br />(04/02/2015)<br />You can sign up for an account on their original site,<br />and temporarily you get $3 off on your first order AND 10% OFF all products.<br />The shop also allows to buy samples for a good price to try out some of their products.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this product!
B000GLRREU|5|absolutely love it..<br /><br />now I dont have to embarrassed when my dentist asks if i do flossing or not..<br /><br />it works perfectly..
B00L0XML1C|4|Very cute. Fits well. It took about two weeks to arrive from China.  I am Pleased with my order. Thanks
B00277BGOI|5|my absolute favorite toothpaste because it help enamel health!
B001MA0QY2|5|I was kind of skeptical because of the price, although I went ahead and bought it. I tried it and it left my hair very nice and straight and shiny! My sister who has very course even liked it because she has a difficult time straightening her hair. I would definitely recommend it to my friends when they are shopping for a new straightener.
B003232550|5|Fantastic Product!
B0012J30LY|4|I use this product everyday and always buy it from Amazon as the price is better than even my membership store.
B002DMK0EE|5|Smells Great. Personally, it smells like earl grey tea. Actually, the entire men's line smells just like this. So no clashing odors between your deodorant and your aftershave or what have you.<br />I've been getting compliments,(not like I stunk before) which is pretty cool.<br />Overall, My skin feels great and the cost is worth it.
B0011DIWGY|5|My daughter has been using this product for a couple of years.  Loves the results she gets from Derma-E products
B00I3JXJOE|5|I'm looking forward to giving this as a gift to some ladies after it worked wonders on my skin!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my review. The review is my opinion only.
B000J41UO2|5|I was hesitant to purchase the Raw Shea Butter soap at first, because I was afraid the frankincense & myrrh would make me smell like an apothecary. But after seeing all these positive reviews I couldn't help myself! I am so happy I went for it: the smell is beautiful, fresh yet sensual, but not heavy at all! It's really moisturizing and gentle. All natural = not super sudsy, which is totally cool with me. I highly recommend it!
B0080L9G9C|1|I was really excited to receive this toothpaste, because I have been looking for a natural tooth paste that was free of sulfates, glycerin, and fluoride. This seemed like the perfect toothpaste since it only has a few ingredients. When it came in I was reading the box while telling my family about it, because I wanted to tell them how few ingredients were in it. That's when I noticed the warning.<br /><br />[California Residents Proposition 65] Warning: This product contains trace amounts of lead, a substance know to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. This product may not be appropriate for consumption by children or pregnant women.<br /><br />This was written right on the box. If I had been in a store I would have place it back on the shelf and walked away. Nowhere on Amazon's listing did I see it say anything about lead.(If it does forgive me, I overlooked it)I did see it clam that it was safe to swallow, but knowing that there is lead in it, even trace amounts, I would never swallow this toothpaste.<br /><br />So, if you are at all concerned with lead, trace amounts or not, then I recommend not buying this item. Since I never opened mine, I am sending it back.
B001DLM2JM|5|I love this for a natural look . It's moisturizing and doesn't have a bunch of weird toxic ingredients like some lipsticks. It's just dark enough to give you some color. Great for daytime.
B00EBZQ86U|5|Smells amazing and lasts all day. Sweet but not overpowering. My favorite new scent. Wish I could afford a bigger bottle right now.
B000GWCJFQ|4|The natural lavender fragrance gives this cleanser a 3. The creamy texture adds another point. I would have given it a 5, but for the extra work it takes to remove &#34;regular&#34; eye makeup. Still, I think there's enough benefit in this all natural product to keep me as a fan!
B003MN7NPC|1|Elastic is so tight it must be made for a child size head. Very disappointed. Took it apart but not worthe price.
B0015YOMYU|4|Strictly as a concealer, this stuff is great. It's best used with a finger, you need to sort of warm it up a bit so that it's not super thick like clay. I use it to cover up dark spots, pimples and around my nose. I learned the hard way that this is NOT an under eye concealer. If you're young and have no dark circles or fine lines, I'm sure you can use it as an under eye concealer (but then again if you're that young you might not even need to conceal under your eyes).<br /><br />I'm in my mid/late 20s and I'm getting some dark circles and a couple of lines under my eyes, not a big deal. But when you use this as an under eye concealer, you accentuate all the lines, all the creases, EVERYTHING. I usually use primer, then concealer and then powder on top to set the concealer. Halfway through the day, I saw my reflection and almost broke the mirror. It was like I had tissue paper than I crumpled up over and over throughout the day and taped it under my eyes. TERRIBLE. I learned my lesson.<br /><br />Bottom line: Used as a concealer, it's great, maybe a touch oily. Don't use this as an under eye concealer.
B004G540WO|2|I have thick hair, so these super small clips literally hold 2-3 strands of my hair. Even for thinner hair, they don't hold much. They are just WAY too small.
B001H270RQ|2|I love Essie, so quite naturally I was excited at getting it in the mail. Only for it to be a total disappointment.<br /><br />I used it on my nails plain with no nail polish underneath and the color turned yellow after it dried!!<br /><br />Really weird so I took off all of it and applied one coat of a very light sheer Essie polish (forgot the name) and applied the top coat.<br /><br />Same thing happened! Nails turned yellow after it dried. Not to mention it took 30-40 minutes to dry and that was with nail dry spray!<br /><br />Disappointed with this product. Will see if I could get my money refunded.
B004C7OISC|2|Its Too small didn't see much improvement. But smells good I guess it OK. Will not buy again not worth it.
B00GM3XWP4|5|this toothpaste is not sweet and it doesn't foam. My teeth are clean even though I only brush once a day ( at night.) I asked the manufacturer about the ingredients, and this is their response:<br /><br />&#34;The main ingredient, Redmond Clay, as well as Real Salt come from Redmond, Utah. The essential oils are wild crafted food grade oils from Sri Lanka. The food grade Non GMO Xylitol (in all flavors except for the Spearmint) is both corn and birch derived and is from China. These ingredients are mixed and packaged in Utah.&#34;<br /><br />Short of making your own, this is the best toothpaste out there for people who care what goes into their bodies
B00E8LUBZ6|5|My Japanese wife really likes this stuff. She says it is made from a tree in Japan.
B001E765FM|5|These last for ever and the price was far less than the stores!
B0080F7ZA0|5|Best of this type of item I have ever used.
B002LHG9HI|3|I have gone through about a jar and a half so far, consistent daily through the first one and slacking on the second, but i started slacking because i wasn't seeing much difference after about a month, but i bought a second jar to wait it out. I just had a baby 7 months ago and i think i am seeing more of difference due to the time passing instead. I wont buy a another bottle, searching for something else.
B00LBBHYLU|5|Great product and a great purchase for the money.  I would defiantly purchase this again...
B00BEJQ8OI|5|Very good product smell amazing my hair looks amazing<br />everything was great very fast shippingi will buy another soon<br />thanks
B00J41JHZA|5|Great price !
B00067YSLO|5|I think this is the best straightener I have had since I started using straighteners. It heats up quickly, has and option to use it both on dry and wet hair and is light to hold.
B004D2DR0Q|5|Amazing, I love it
B005SPEU30|2|These did not last nearly as long as the other Dove bars I've tried.  I was not pleased for the price.
B0009QZYII|5|This is my favorite hair gel. It doesn't flake and has a pleasant scent. In my opinion, it is the best gel for the money.
B00DQBMN6E|2|Wow!  How disappointing!!  Feels like a bit of egg white drying in your eye. Didn't shrink any thing..left a crust as another Customer said,  what a waste if $70.00. Don't do it!!!!!  Also, order came with no paper work for me to return!!!  Just wrong.  Buyer be ware
B002UFS334|4|My wife is integrating as much organic foods, supplements, and beauty products as possible into her daily regimen. She really enjoys this particular product for its clean, fresh smell.
B00D7WEFCC|5|I cannot live without these. As soon as I start to feel a pimple I apply one of these to keep myself from picking it and leave on over night. In the morning the pimple is almost gone!!! I repeat this until it is gone completely. It keeps small cuts, pimples, and burns from scarring. I know that it is for wrinkles and that does help with that. But, for me my cystic occasional acne etc is where it is at for me!!!!! I cannot live without these!!!! Put on dry skin patches and zap!!!! By morning it is sooo much better.
B000QRFGP6|4|If you don't like to turn red after using a product DO NOT use this lotion! However, it doesn't take long to notice a difference.
B000GWHBCW|5|I can use very few products on my hair and PM is great for me. Like the large size so I can just refill the smaller one I keep out.
B00U6P9B7M|5|I'm picky about what I eat and put on my skin, and try to use organic products whenever I can.  I was pleased to be asked to test this eye cream when I saw that it's not only USA-made, organic and natural but that it also has my favorite anti-aging ingredients: hyaluronic acid (holds in moisture, improves elasticity of skin) and Vitamin C (reverses sun damage and regenerates skin cells).  I've been using serums and creams with those ingredients for several years and can really see the difference in my middle aged skin.<br /><br />This cream also contains Matrixyl 3000 (an antioxidant), Tripeptide-5 (stimulates collagen regeneration), retinol (Vitamin A, boosts collagen, speeds up cellular regeneration) and Glycolic Acid (fades sun spots, exfoliates dead skin cells).  All great things for faces of any age!<br /><br />I've been using it (twice a day) around my eyes and mouth for three weeks and I really like it.  It's fragrance free and leaves my skin deeply moisturized and plumped.  I believe it's also lived up to the &#34;firming&#34; part of its name because the bags under my eyes seem slightly diminished.  Of course I still look middle aged - no cream or potion will be able to make me look 20 again.  But when my skin looks dewy and the wrinkles and bags are diminished I declare victory.  Knowing I'm getting these benefits with organic ingredients and not unpronounceable chemicals makes me that much happier.<br /><br />I received a complimentary sample of Elba Advanced Eye Firming Cream for testing and review purposes. I wasn't asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item. Look at the hundreds of reviews I've written over ten years and you'll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.
B000QS59ZM|5|These new battery powered teeth polishers are super effective and easy to use and much better than trying to brush by hand.
B000P20TZO|5|I have worn this for years. Most compliments on the fragrance. The best. Friends are wanting some but not available in many stores. Mostly airports.
B0000531PS|5|This is another must have product. It helps a lot when you want the \\"celebrities' look\\".
B003HG4GQI|1|Top pops open while in use. Explodes shaving everywhere
B003QYFVRY|5|What can I say about this product? It's awesome. I've never been happier with any other product as much as I am with this one. First let me start off by saying they gave me an estimated ship date then when I placed the order it said a day before that which was a Monday & I ordered on the Monday or Tuesday before & my package came on that Saturday. I love when things come early. So I opened it up & it was fully charged & I went to town on my teeth. & omg, my teeth felt like I just walked out of the dentist & in just that first brush they were a lil whiter too. I'm so happy with this toothbrush, I've tried oral b (sucks) & others but none compare to this. & for those ppl that complain about mold & water getting in idk what they're doing Letting it swim in the sink? Cuz water don't get in mine but maybe a lil. & anything that close to my mouth I don't mind cleaning every now & then, lazy ass ppl. I order a SonicSeal just to be safe but I'm very happy with this product. The only thing that coulda made it better is if it was free. I highly recommend this product.!
B0032FSDOA|3|Can't get tangles out of my hair, even when using conditioner.  I lose a lot of hair trying to get it combed out.  Would not recommend.
B004Y9LMN2|4|I'm more of a matte lipstick girl but this color is gorgeous!
B004RUEJ10|5|Great lotion and the scent of this one is my favorite. Not to strong but just right. A must try.
B001FB5ILE|5|Non-greasy, nice aroma, SPF 15, what's not to like. I get it in bulk and use it daily.
B004153MG4|5|Tried axe, old spice, and degree. All made pits itch and had a chemical smell. This stuff is awsome, been using for 2 weeks with no itch or harsh odor
B008A12F36|3|It's okay have use other ones that perform better ,I find myself contuining to tighten the nozzle up a lot or it slides off. I give I a 3.
B00022WA9U|1|This unit was bad in so many ways that I returned it after one try:    -There is no way of knowing how long to wait before the curlers heat up--the booklet doesn't say and there is no way to tell on the unit itself.  -The curlers are so short that it's almost impossible to only hold the cool end while manipulating your hair over the entire curler (there is a cool end and a very hot end to each curler)  -The metal holders do not not hold hair on the curlers  -The curlers burn the scalp  -The cover won't stay on if the unit is shifted at all.    Soooo-\\"one star\\". I would have given it \\"no stars\\" if that had been an option.
B007JBF99U|5|This product works really well. It smoothed out my skin and didn't irritate it. The smell is fine and the dispenser is great because it protects the product and is more sanitary than a tub where you repeatedly put dirty hands in. The less bacteria on your skin the better. This also helped my blackheads and pimples. Used as a routine should help maintain a nice glowy face.
B00IS6XPQY|5|works amazing! i have really short asian eyenlashes and now they are longer and thicker. it does tingle a little when i first put it on.
B0057YYL7W|5|Perfect replacement for older Swift FX assembly
B00006JT6O|5|60 year old male who has discovered the wonders of facial cremes and related care. I had the good fortune to have results within a few weeks after applying daily before bed. A little goes a long way and is not oily, greasy, or a pain in the......Works well in conjunction with other items. Remember there's no shame in facial care whatever your sex.  It is important so keep on keeping on chief!
B005K1RV2Y|5|Cute color and definitely works!
B000RYYI7K|4|Great price!
B00T7WNHK2|4|I spoke to my wife about my free samples of Gillette Fusion products which was both the razor with FlexBall and the 2 in 1 Gel from Gillette/BzzAgent. My wife thinks I have way to many &#34;products&#34; as a guy and she wanted to know why I need all this stuff, especially a new razor. I told her that actually the Fusion 2 in 1 actually replaces 3 items (guess I didn't help my cause lol) my pre shave lotion, my shaving soap and my post shaving lotion and it does a good if not great job at all 3 and I had her feel my face after my shave to show her the job that it did.. She was impressed.... No for why do I need a new Razor? The true answer was I didn't, I have the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power and I was hopeing to tell my wife that with the new FlexBall it put my old one to shame and so far I have to honestly say it didn't.... The new FlexBall claims to keep my blades sharper longer, which I haven't used enough yet to prove, but if it's telling the truth saving money is always a WIN WIN conversation with my wife but until I can prove that claim she won that round .... So to recap, my wife was won over by the fact that the Gel could replace 3 items that are currently in our shower, also by how smooth and hydrated my face was, but she didn't see any difference in my shave with the addition of the Flexball but jury is still out if it keeps my blades sharper for longer which would save on expensive refills....
B00JM987VE|5|I am so careful about what I put on my skin especially around the eye area and I am very impressed with the Aya eye cream. First of all, it has lovely ingredients incuding sweet almond, avocado and olive oil as well as shea butter. This cream is very light and feels soothing to my skin and the delicate eye area. It does not irritate at all which is my primary concern! I love that it has a natural scent which is light and slightly herblike. I like the smell. I hate perfumey scents so this was refreshing. I've been using it for a few weeks now and I can say that it does seem to diminish the puffiness I've been having. I also notice some diminishing of dark circles and will continue to use it to keep the skin around my eyes healthy. Very impressed.
B002XIZNM2|4|I have been a loyal user of Inner Grace for more than a year--and that remains my fave Philosophy shower gel. However, I got a yen to try one of the others. I almost got the Amazing Grace, but at the last minute, changed to this one. Why? There's something about this scent that takes me back. There is this \\"baby cologne\\" smell that is reminiscent of the way children smelled in my Cuban childhood. Not the violet baby cologne, but a more perfumey, less floral one--crisper, more unisex and \\"soapy\\". That nostalgia is worth paying extra for.<br /><br />I like the creamy formula, even though it does have a strong surfactant--SLS--which will irritate some. I have supersensitive skin and, sometimes, I have to go strictly with Cetaphil or Aveeno or Aquaphor or other unscented products. But when I can handle scents, I like Philosophy's line, as it doesn't irk me like some skinwise. Between the more sensual Inner Grace and this crisper Pure Grace, I have shower gel/cream to cover a couple of my moods.<br /><br />For a cream, this lathered exceedinly nicely on my washcloth. I felt very clean--well, duh, it has a strong cleanser--but also moisturized somewhat, which is nice.<br /><br />Not everyone is gonna love this scent. Some might find it on the sharp side, on the Zesty soapy side, but it fades quickly, like all other Philosophy bath scents. Layering only helps slightly. Dunno why, but Philosophy scents just don't have \\"hold.\\" But that's okay. Smells so nice while you're showering.<br /><br />One star off for the 1. strong cleanser when they've made a cream formula to be \\"gentler\\" and 2. the quick dissipation of scent.<br /><br />But I would rebuy just the same. Nostalgia is a potent thing.<br /><br />Enjoy,
B00CR6X0IY|5|Accurate and fast delivery
B00HFQQ0VU|5|This little unit, though canned by many who have other models, works perfectly for me and takes up only a small amount of precious counter space. Seems durable enough to me. I am pleased and hope my dentist will be too!
B0030HFX9S|3|I like this product but i feel like it doesn't make a HUGE difference, but it's still good. I have really oily skin so after i put on concealer i feel like it comes off a little too easily because my oily skin so this helps it last a little longer throughout the day.
B006LAFU80|3|Yes very good. I recommend to everyone thank you
B008AHWN3W|5|Easy to apply but doesn't last longer than two days.
B009AQXN86|1|It was broken
B008B4F4HQ|1|It was expensive, turned my skin orange and it streaked . I wouldn't recommend it to any one. I can't believe I ordered Two and it wasn't cheap. Waste of good money. Sorry the truth hurts. Oh and I had to SCRUB it off with Chlorox!!!!  Really would like my money back.
B005WLZVBU|5|Perfect
B001KY9ODO|2|This never indicated that it is 2 each of 3 sizes - there should be better description included for it
B0086VI9LC|5|I once bought the generic brand brush heads and they were awful. They just didn't attach quite right and the power wasn't as good. These are great and work just as well as the original that came with the brush. Do not try to save money with another brand get these.
B006Z8XNXC|1|A WASTE OF MONEY.  VERY FLIMSY CONSTRUCTION.
B008XCNH0W|5|Love this concealer.
B0014AYTQQ|4|I've used items of this nature for a long time.  It's useful for washing one's back, normally hard to reach.
B000OUKOES|5|This is a great alternative to Petroleum Jelly.It does take some getting used to and it is a lot more expensive. However, if you don't like the idea of slathering a petroleum product on your body or lips get this, you'll get used to it. It's funny,it's kind of like cooking oil but I love it.
B008JFSVLI|5|My wife and I use this product daily for our orthodontic retainers.  Three minutes a day and the retainers are clean.
B001OPH7PG|5|I got the soap and bathed with it and also left some on my skin. It has some great qualities to this soap and the soap helped to heal the rash up quicker and stops the itch.
B00062ADJA|5|I've been using this loose face powder for severral years and I love it.  It dissappears and leaves your face beautifully matte but not dry looking.
B007PTGHKQ|4|I used this a few times once I received it. So far, it works pretty nice. It isn't too oily and it does moisturize pretty well. I mainly use it on the dry spots on my arms and stretch marks on my stomach. It is something that I would purchase again. Fast shipping as well. Thank you.
B010B918S2|1|If you want angled brushes do not order these. Received straight brushes that say they can be bent to 90 degrees. Item number is same as website but photo shows an angled brush.
B0002DO4EI|1|I was lead to believe that i was getting on more than one eyeshadows and I am pissed. I am angry
B000FZZ4D8|5|Great Price and service on this product. I've been using Cat Walk Shampoo and conditioner on my colored blond hair for over 2 years and am very satisfied with the results.
B006HCJXBM|5|these eyeliners have been so easy to use and the colors are great. I didn't receive the white one, but thats fine. they have okay lasting power on dont smudge that much. they do after a few hours of wear.
B007O7AZBG|5|Love it
B00PDK5ZTS|5|my daughter loves this stuff
B00HX27AM4|5|Worked for me almost immediately, After about a month I can say that I have to shave and tweeze less than half as often as I used to. I heard that it can take up to six months to get a full result, so I'm optimistic.
B002I93SJ6|5|I use Cloud 9 shampoo and conditioner on my red colored hair and can't believe how well it maintains my color between appointments.  I decided to try the rootfix and have been very happy with the lift it gives my fine hair.
B0016J9ZUU|5|This shampoo smells amazing.  It is a smooth gentle spread on the scalp with a creamy texture.  It smells like perfume.
B0009OAFVG|1|This doesn't work at all.
B0030YQD68|4|I just received this kit, it is smaller and perfect for travel.  Great find and buy.  I would recommend as well because the products are of high quality.
B00CBYDKZA|5|Thermofit really is a fantastic combination for weight loss. You have Capsicum to increase your energy output to burn more calories as well as suppress your appetite, Acai Berry extract, Rasberry Keytones, Vitamin B12, Chromium, Guarana Seed Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and more! The best thing to ask yourself is whether you think all of these extracts work or not. Do your research. If you think you believe the research, then try the Thermofit. Not everyone responds the exact same way to any given supplement, so some people will see better results than others. That's just the nature of our personal body chemistry being so unique and different from one another. For me personally, I have lost weight with it (7lbs in a month and I was already of average weight, not overweight) I'm more impressed with the energy it gives me during the day when I take it. As a mother of four young kids, I'm ready to fall asleep on the couch at 2pm every day. When I'm taking Thermofit, I NEVER feel the need for a nap and I forget what fatigue feels like, honestly! It can be life changing if you tend to be fatigued every day.<br />If you decide to purchase, however, know that it is against It Works! policy for distributors to sell on Amazon, so you are buying from a distributor knowingly going against company policy.

B003COAFPQ|4|I bought this product after watching several YouTube videos of others who have used it and a lot of reading about its potential usefulness in my situation.<br />I am very pleased. It took a little while to get used to the thickness of it but after that it was all good.<br />My order arrived very quickly and I have had no problems.
B0006NBM5I|5|I love this. I use it to do my natural nails- I have the toughest nails around and this is great for trimming and shaping my Teflon toenails. For the price it's a great piece of equipment, comes with lots of goodies you may or may not ever need. I'm going to try this on my dog's nails since the Dremel made for pets is horrid. If I wore acrylics I'd definitely use this to do touch ups and probably my own fill-ins.
B009N9PJHS|5|I love this cream and it smells like fresh fruit, pineapples and coconut.  It actually plumps up the delicate skin around my eyes!
B0019GXOXY|5|I have been using this for 1 year, which is unheard of for me. I was constantly switching moisturizers, trying to find something that worked well with my skin.<br /><br />I'm 21, have very fair and very dry skin. It's mildly sensitive, and I was worried I might have a reaction to the essential oils in this lotion, as other reviewers stated they had allergic reactions to it. After all that, my skin is prone to break outs so this lotion has literally been a MIRACLE for my face.<br /><br />Before, I used Philosophy's Hope in a Jar moisturizer for dry skin. This was WAY to expensive ($40 for 2 oz!!!) and made my skin break out.<br /><br />I honestly can't believe I found something that has continued to work for a year for my skin. (I started trying different products when my dry face started itching at the age of only 11!!)<br /><br />This BWC Vitamin C lotion is wonderful. I had to get used to the sort of woody scent (essential oils I'm guessing) But since I started using it, my skin has never been better and I really like the smell. Less break-outs (hormones still cause me to break out sometimes)<br /><br />**My own little secret**: Add almond oil to this lotion. It makes it last twice as long AND gives your skin even more of a soft glow. I just save my old containers so I have something to mix it in. Start out with a drop or two and see how it works!<br /><br />**I also bought this lotion for my sister who has acne scars. In the past 6 months, her scars are drastically less visible and her face has a glow that I've never seen it have before.
B00JF6TSA8|5|Seems to work good so far.
B000C1Z2WS|1|For at least 35 years, Diorissimo by Christian Dior had always been my fragrance and even after settling in the U.S. Every time coming through London, I always made sure I had a couple of duty free ones purchased.  For the past three years I was saddened that I could not find it anymore not here nor overseas.  Seeing that Amazon carries it gave me hope to try, although I had the warning in my mind not to fall into temptation as I have heard and read the stories of others...  So today I get the package and unfortunately it was a totally different fragrance, not even a pleasant one.  I am sure I will never buy fragrances on the internet.
B00G5WYD6Y|5|I will continue to order from you this is a wonderful product and I use them daily
B00TXWTGSI|4|pretty good :-)
B0089GBCEK|5|AS ADVERTISED
B00763LZOY|1|I asked for Clairol Crème Colourant nicen easy 75 with no Ammonia and no Peroxide,not the one pictured .
B0009PL4D8|5|I was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that I had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews.  The reviews are CORRECT.  The air that comes out of this dryer is incredible -- it dries my hair quickly, but the nice thing is that it dries your hair with air and not by baking it with intense heat-- it is hot, but not scorching.  A great purchase!
B00B4TR3KG|5|Got this scent because it was on some list of &#34;top mens colognes rated by women&#34;. I had used another versace cologne years ago and liked it, this one is even better. Will buy again.
B00LBD65TA|5|I recently purchased the flat top kabuki brush by Beauty Junkees and it is amazing. It is so soft and buffs out my liquid foundation perfectly. It leaves my face looking and feeling airbrushed. I would highly recommend this brush to all makeup lovers and artists. I will definitely order the entire kabuki set soon!
B003CRA4FE|5|I like the taste -- the good thing is it won't get boring or annoying after a while (which happens to me often with most of the toothpastes). The feeling of freshness and smooth teeth lasts long...
B001FS0HAY|5|No other mirror for us older folks.
B00CE2JC9W|5|Excellent product
B00159ABPO|1|I have *tiny* hands and these gloves fit me perfectly, BUT... they also soaked up all of the lotion I'd put on my hands. Waste of time, money and effort.
B00G5L867C|5|My kid loves it. Good quality.
B00IITI5ES|3|This helps you cut a somewhat straight line, but I found it easier to watch a few cosmetologists online to cut the layers myself.
B00D1QY6YQ|5|Beautiful. Better than the picture.  All the envelope bags are gorgeous and so well-made.
B005ZXOQKC|5|This stuff smells awesome.  I'm ordering more.  It wears well no greasiness. And the smell is still good the next day.  I'm ordering more lotion.  Shampoo, body wash and conditioner in this brand. Love love them
B0089TDTU2|1|Not a very good mirror.  It is very small and difficult to use.  I would not recommend it.
B00GDV55B4|5|Definitely loves. i try out two night my skin look so clean and smooth. it's seem more healthy than 2 days ago. i do really appreciate it. recommend others to try out too.
B006533RFQ|5|Got this for my kiddo to help cut down on the wasted soap. To that end, it works just fine.
B001LYAQCG|5|This is an outstanding razor. A brand new razor with vintage style.    Merkur is one of the few razor companies still turning out high quality double-edged safety razors. They sell a number of different models many of which can be found here on Amazon. Most of those models, even those costing quite a bit more than this one, use the same head geometry so they will all give you essentially the same performance. The differences are all in the handle design -- heavier and/or longer in all combinations. But see next paragraph.    They do have some more \\"exotic\\" models: adjustables, \\"slants\\", open comb, etc. having different head geometry but those are more specialized and if you are looking for a second (or third) razor they might very well be appropriate for you.    If you are looking for your first or tenth DE safety razor this one is quite appropriate. As I said above it will give you a shaving experience as good as many more expensive Merkurs without any extraneous features/frills/gimmicks (however you want to characterize them) and at a lower cost than all but one ([[ASIN:B0009IIBFE Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight]]) which is usually about the same price as this one, sometimes a dollar more sometimes a dollar less.    In addition, this razor is nickel plated instead of chrome plated like the other Merkurs. The difference can't be seen in the pictures on Amazon but it is quite apparent in person. The nickel plating was used to enhance the overall \\"antique\\" look of this razor, along with the handle design. I think the Nickel finish is more elegant than the chrome -- and the handle design, in addition to giving this razor a nice look, is quite functional. The six flat sides give it a nice positive feel in your hand.    Well worth your consideration no matter if you are new to DE safety razor shaving or if you are an old hand.    HINT:    The razor comes with one blade so you will certainly need to buy more. It comes with a Merkur blade and although Merkur makes top-shelf razors they are not known (at least in a positive sense) for their blades. So when you order a Merkur razor you should also order a few blades. You might want to Google for \\"sample razor blade pack\\" to get a few each of several different kinds to try. Do this before you load up on bulk amounts of blades of a single kind.
B001534TD0|5|Arrived promptly.  Otem as described.
B004061V30|3|work as it should. Having little ones getting haircuts it helps keep hair from getting on clothes as it should
B0052PM01K|5|Love the Bioderma and how it does not irritate my skin. This travel version of the classic will serve me well.
B001G7QYZQ|5|My hair is a couple inches past my shoulders & is pretty coarse, thick(in the back) & what I would call &#34;spiral-perm&#34; curly. Consequently, it's very difficult to straighten, even w/ a ceramic straightener. This tends to result in a lot of damage to my hair b/c of all the pulling & multiple passes w/ a straight iron set to a high temperature.<br />Got2b Crazy Sleek has saved my hair & I love the results. Smooth, sleek, straight hair that isn't weighed down or sticky feeling.<br />To apply, I towel dry my hair after my shower & run a comb through it. Then I take the spray lid off the bottle & just pour about a dime/nickel sized amount of Crazy Sleek into the palm of my hand, rub my hands together & lightly work through my hair. I make sure to put the majority of the product on the curliest parts of my hair(the back) & then whatever is left over, I lightly run through the thinner, less curly sides/front. I try not to apply any to my roots so I don't get any &#34;greasy&#34; look going on. I then blow dry my hair & then straighten with a ceramic straight iron. Works like a charm every time!
B00FRDPSE8|5|The shea shampoo and conditioner set are my favorite, followed by brilliant glossing.  I use the apple cider shampoo once every week or two, also.  My hair just thrives with the Fekkai products.  It's light, airy and full-bodied after using.
B004OHDNJA|2|OK smell but wasn't very moisturizing.  Even the smell (and I love gardenias) was a little overpowering.  There are better creams out there.
B000PY17PI|5|Love this and would recommend to anyone.
B004VZVIXS|5|I love it catches a small hair took to long to grow back
B00KL0HV56|5|Excellent product!
B0009R15GW|5|This is my favorite hair gel.  Why I don't know, but this product has been discontinued and the only way I can find it is on line.  I am running out of places to find it on line.  I have been buying it in bulk everytime i find it on the internet.  One day there will be no more.  What will i do?????
B005HG4XDW|5|Amazing coverage without looking heavy! No need to use a concealer or anything else. Great foundation! I have oily skin and it works perfectly!You will be back home after a party night looking exactly the way you left your home! Love it!
B005SJU3ZA|5|I have been using this kitchen spray for years. Best scent ever!
B00WHF05SI|5|These plates are pretty thick. Nice quality
B00IN49CCW|5|looks great, and it is much cheaper than buying from shops. love it
B008FAINNI|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! THe smell of this is so nice. The scent stays with you through out the day.
B00CX9EXOA|5|Wow, this product worked just as I had hoped.  However, I'm probably a little different than most because I had laser hair removal done about 10 years ago.  Over the years some of the hair &#34;rejuvenated&#34; plus the laser treatments didn't remove any of the light-colored hair.  I found it necessary to shave every couple of months or tweeze several dark hairs as they surfaced.  I just used this product and it worked perfectly.  I will never have to shave again.  I could feel a slight sting when the hair was being &#34;plucked&#34; but that only told me it was working.  If I had a lot more hair it would probably hurt more but for me it was virtually painless.
B0006FIDP8|5|This is my 3rd? bottle of Today perfume by Avon through this seller...very quick delivery, never a problem. This scent is good anytime, anywhere, very pleasant, never overpowering or obnoxious...just pretty and clean I'm told. That's what I'm after.
B009NG3SBK|5|beautiful, good to gift!
B001RPL902|5|This was for my wife.  And she was ecstatic with this item.  It is awesome!
B00DIIM7KW|5|As expected will order again
B00DMHU7QK|5|This is my wife's favorite lotion. It is hard to find now that Bath and Body Works aren't making it.
B000J2A8DS|4|It sure does cover up things for me.
B0095PLXU2|3|its alright smells like lime then dries down to candy, does not last long on my skin as why to the three star review,but its good stuff order it and use it!
B000CEQZZS|5|this is the original barbershop smell I remember as a young man, I love clubman products this is just the best
B005XP4YNQ|5|Amazing! My pores are smaller, lines are remarkably reduced and not as deep, skin feels more firm. I am 57 years old and this has helped get rid of white head blemishes and even jowles are better! Order this not one with alcohol and glycerin, I ha
B00OPD1WSM|5|Really good tool - be sure to clean after each use.
B002BWYROA|5|i received the item. all ok
B00D3OX3EU|3|I'll have to put some stitching into these to make them last -- just like the ones I bought before.  One day someone will start making the net &#34;poufs&#34; with an elastic closure, but in the meantime this works fine.
B003N8YBL0|3|I purchased these directly through Sally's own website about 6 months ago. These work well, though they seem a bit flimsy and likely to break. For my hair length+thickness these are too long for me but they do what they are supposed to do. These are actually my first set of hair sticks and it took me a while to learn how to put my hair up with them and have it stay up. I now can use one instead of two to keep my hair up all day. These are very useful and low cost. Had these been a harder/denser plastic I would have rated them higher. I have yet to break one, but I am very careful. These do flex when I am putting my hair up which freaks me out but these are great! They are very smooth, though they do have a seam which is not ideal. I am looking to upgrade my hair sticks with wooden sticks which is how I came across this here on Amazon.<br /><br />My hair is about armpit length on the sides and almost bra strap length in the back, and has some long layers which I am growing out. My hair is a complete mix of super fine through very thick strands and is slightly to moderately wavy. If I put my hair up in a ponytail my hair circumference is approx 3 inches, though I have lost a lot of hair as a side effect of food allergies. May be a bit thinner than that currently.<br /><br />I find that with these sticks (maybe for all sticks in general) my hair holds up much better if I have the thicker end of the stick at the bottom of my bun when placed. I look kind of ridiculous with this very tall stick sticking up over the top of my head thanks to the length of this hair stick but it works and doesn't cause any problems in my hair that I've noticed. I do tend to bump it while getting in and out of my car though, so I have to duck more than I expect to when I wear this and am traveling in my car. I haven't measured, but generally this stick sticks out of the top of my bun by about 4 inches which likely would mean I need a stick about 3 inches shorter to be a perfect fit.<br /><br/>I do recommend purchasing these in-store to save on the shipping cost as it's a bit high for only very light-weight hair sticks. In all, these sticks are NOT worth the total price (with shipping) of almost 10 bucks. They are worth the $3.99 price though if you don't have to pay shipping.
B008A3ZEJ6|5|Love this blue
B00GIXIG0Y|1|she wasnt happy with it
B008DWSJ1O|5|This 'thank you' has been a while coming with the holidays etc, but just wanted to let you know that I have had rave reviews from everyone regarding my hair color! Great product and please save my &#34;magic formula&#34; in my files. Very impressed with the kit which makes it very easy for my sister and I to have a ladies night in (although we save the wine until after we do our hair :) ). Thanks!
B00DYBS6FS|4|Very creamy and not greasy.  Just wish it worked better on my ezcema, but I haven't really found anything that does.  This is great as a standard body cream and it smells good too!
B0006LJC48|5|It is very good makeup, don't put it on your eyelids or in the corner of your eye, it will cause irritation , most makeup will and then you find yourself with red eyes and a beautiful makeup job, but none the less, red eyes., pat it on blend and it takes years off the look of your face.  glamma.
B000PBQZOE|2|This straightener is bulky and awkward.  It also pulls your hairs.  Looks good but disappointed in the product.  I would not buy this product again.
B00JUJ1BJG|5|My 5 yr and I both like this toothpaste.
B0009EILAS|5|I have used Aveeno for 10 plus years now. It is great for people like me who have dry skin and oily skin to. I usually rotate between Aveeno Active body wash (with out fragrance)  and the Aveeno (with fragrance ) body wash depending on the time of year or if I'm having skin issues. Its cheaper to buy (2) two bottles from Amazon.com then other local big name stores. If you use Amazon Market Place to have other items shipped every how many months you need something, you can add the Aveeno on to get the free shipping and never run out. You can always skip or have it shipped sooner.
B001E35Y58|1|DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. IT IS A KNOCK OFF BRAND. THIS IS NOT PURE ROMANCE, IT IS A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE THAT IS EXTREMELY LOW QUALITY
B004QLOFRI|3|Hello- I was curious to use this product -so I ordered 2 kinds - 10 years younger - yes, makes visible slight skin lift , and keep makeup in place for whole day- I will continue use it  - but what I dont like light shine the product leaves . other may say skin glow - but to my skin it looks as I am oily . not healthy glowing . THE SECOND type regular - I bought for my teen and he did not notice big difference - I dont think I would buy it again-  but just to try I dont regret
B00GR4WVVO|5|My 4 year old LOVES this stuff. Great gift idea for all ages. I love the cinnamon/clove combo, too!
B0012RWTP4|5|This great product in Italy is 1,5 Euro (little over 2 dollars). and we are getting charged over 50 $ for it. Insane.
B009RY694G|3|Ok but doesn't really smell like Be Delicious. Also doesn't last very long.
B005W6OI8M|3|Looking for a replacement for a discontinued miracle product called Miss Cool 5 Minute Set. I'll keep looking.
B009EH1NI8|5|I love the fragrance so of course the the &#34;savon&#34; is a hit.
B006RAZ5RU|3|Ever since I started using this product people have noticed. I am 53 and sagging eyes can be an issue. I feel I look very good for my age and this product makes a big difference. I will use this forever!!
B0086LC49K|5|I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.
B000HD3TIK|5|Love this comb.  Use it everyday and it is great for the light teasing that I do to add height.
B000FH9G6C|4|I bought this product for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She's always loved Sebastian products but she was ecstatic when I bought this hair spray and she really loves how it works on her hair!
B001F51R6K|5|I believe the Trac II Plus razor blades are simply the best razor blades you can buy. I went back to a double edge razor recently. I found unless you have a top quality blade in a DE razor, you do not get a smooth close shave. With a Trac II blade, you can count on a smooth, slick, close shave everytime. It seems that 2 blades work better than 5 blades or even 3 blades. When Gillette made the Trac II razor blades they made perfection. They still sell  razors for these today.
B004Z4SLU8|5|I could not believe my eyes when I opened the box and found all these products. I had to double check to make sure the price was right. And it was!  YEEESSSS! These tattoo machines work better than the cosmetic pens. I would have preferred if instructions were included, but I bet there is a better selection of videos and information on the internet. Great buy.
B00KVOKJ1A|5|I just got this, and I love it, makes my nails really hard,
B007K6K0IY|5|Love it!  Light and fresh feeling that lasts.  I was given this product free to sample and now I'm hooked!  I felt protected all day, from work to chasing 2 little ones, all the while I didn't have to worry about white marks on my clothes.  I honestly can say I love this product.
B0040JIBIU|5|works well
B000A7W5DI|5|My periodontist recommended this electric toothbrush and, after doing much Internet research, I bought it at Amazon, which had the best price. This is not my first electric toothbrush. Until it died, I had a Braun for years. This is much more efficient in massaging the gums and getting between teeth. Following directions and brushing for two minutes is made easier by the pulse that alerts you to a 30-second interval, followed by a smiley face after two minutes. I can feel the different in my gums and that's the point. Simply put: highly recommended.
B000RTXPRO|5|Great product,  great price, and great seller.
B004HJ6TAA|1|Doesn't get rid of hair as noted.  Just gets hair down to razor stuble and no further.  I wouldn't suggest buying it.
B0008MFI3Y|3|This gel only takes a small amout to cover your face. I also take any extra and spread it on my colar bone area. It is too soon yet to see if this product is making a difference to my overall skin condition.
B0018V78OG|5|This is my second Silicon Mix, I really liked it!<br />My hair is thin and blond and it's great for my hair too!
B000VXD0QM|5|Covergirl classic tan matches my skin tone perfectly.  It is just dark enough and not too orangey like a lot of other foundations are when they are for tan skin.  Growing up, all my mom would wear is covergirl foundation so naturally it was the first foundation I ever tried.  As I got older, I tried all different kinds, low to high priced, different formulas, etc.  I realized that if I wanted to have a reliable, natural looking foundation for a lower price, this would be the one to try.  My skin can get dry around certain areas but CG smoothers hydrating makeup does the trick.  I am wearing it right now as I am typing this.  It has stayed on all day long throughout my work day.  It moisturizes my skin but does not make it look greasy or oily.  I would definetly recommend this foundation for anyone with dry skin.  I have had no problems with this at all I only have good things to say about it:)
B004TH6QDU|2|Really not impressed- I prefer the oil much more - this is like applying water to my face- don't waste your money
B002V7NGLK|5|I really love these products. They were recommended to me by a local salon who told me they were developed in Sweden and thus cater to finer strand hair very well. I have found this to be true for me.
B009GHHW5Y|3|It's ok but won't purchase again...
B00RVVPEA2|5|My wavy hair gets straighter as it gets dryer. This gel has great hold, and trapped moisture in my hair to keep it curly. Without it I have a white guy fro, with it I have tight dark glossy curls. Great effect.
B0116EYR2A|5|Perfectly good.
B003YJAZZ4|4|A little on the expensive side but is a great shaver
B000C1ZDSG|5|VERY SATISFIED WITH AMAZON SERVICE WILL ALWAYS USE AMAZON  THANKS
B00EH9QM16|5|I wear a full set of blue clip in hair extensions, but I wanted another piece to spice things up a bit. I absolutely love it. It is very silky and smooth and tangle free. The clips are amazing! Usually, depending on the extensions you buy, you have to tease your roots of your hair and clip the extension where it is teased in order for them to stay in. I do not have to do that with this product. It's very cute and stylish. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to had a little awesome to their hair. :D Five stars is my rating. I love it! :D
B002AJI4SE|3|ITS NOT TOO STEADY WHEN YOU GRAB ONTO TOP TO EXIT BATHTUB.....DON'T TRUST IT NOW.I HAVE PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP ME FEEL SAFER EXITING THE BATHTUB
B000S01TBG|5|Really love it - the lotion is comforting and works well without residue and smells great.  Glad I was able to find it outside of when I vacation.
B000C1UBR4|4|I have been using this product for a while, my wife likes this a lot. The price for then amount of perfume you get is a real good value
B00BISL6VA|5|It works better for me than anything else I have tried.
B00GX83578|5|Good
B00016X1I6|5|My hair grows at a snail's pace, which is depressing after you get an awful haircut... which is what happened to me. On top of that I'm losing a lot of hair due to stress, so I ordered this vegan Horsetail (silica) after I read about the possible benefits. I was a little skeptical something on its own (and not in the form of a supplement) could help, but it's been roughly a month (maybe closer to two) on these supplements and I can actually tell my hair is growing faster. While I continue to shed hair, I see absolutely no difference in the volume of my hair, which is amazing. I'm upping my dosage to two tablets in the hopes it will continue to grow and strengthen my hair. Two months ago my hair was a bit lower than chin level, and today I'm about an inch from shoulder level, and I have a long neck. Please give this supplement a chance if you are trying to achieve optimal growth...it really works!
B005IMHF3K|5|These are very nice bobby pins and they have a protective rubber tip so they do not scratch your scalp.  they arrived within two days and there are one hundred snd eight of them.  thank you.
B0076HP5YG|5|This is a stunning fall vampy color. Near black inside, but stunning dark plum in natural light. If you are an OPI enthusiast, it is very similar but slightly darker than Suzi and the 7 Dusseldorfs.
B00Q5226EK|2|This looked very cheap .
B000VUYQOA|3|If you've never used a pig bristle toothbrush, you're in for a treat!  Not really...  The brush is okay to brush with, nothing special, to be honest.  The whole time I was using it, I just kept thinking about the pig whose body the bristles came from.  So it's got some novelty factor, but not much else.  The wood does start to get grungy pretty quick from being exposed to water all the time, so the brush does have a fairly short lifespan when used daily.  I only bought this item for fun and switched back to a plastic toothbrush after a month or so.
B000HTNBB4|4|Will get hot. Will burn the ears. Chin strap makes you look ridiculous. Chin strap not necessary. Doesn't cover whole head
B001G7PLC8|5|not really but sure is nice on bad sun burns.<br /><br />aloe feels good<br />why do i need so many words?
B004XADBZO|1|damaged
B00G0FT5YQ|5|This is a terrific mascara. Having the smaller sizes make it great for travel.
B009CE42R2|3|very sheer...i purchased this product to be a &#34;light&#34; foundation....was light indeed...but that was about all it did...giant waste of money...can find product of same quality for half the price if you go to the drug store.
B003HLL0Q2|5|The angled liner brush has really great results! Smooth lines every time, and the liner residue doesn't cling to the brush. It's super easy to clean.
B00LP9UJCO|5|This dryer is not only fast but dries by hair without the frizzy dry look. its quiet, has multiple settings,leaves my hair shiny, silky, soft and frizz free.What more could you ask for in a blow dryer and for less than $40?
B007SNGSFS|5|The only way to but these refills. Very economical.
B00BJ7IWNA|5|this kit is very easy to use. i used it by myself and it only took about 10 minutes. the only thing i would change, are the rings it comes with. it is very hard to snap the balls back onto the rings. my girlfriend loves to play with them and it has made my nipples very sensitive. now she wants me to do hers.
B001TSNA8G|5|The ends meet together nicely and really grip the hair.  My old Revlon tweezers stopped grabbing the hair, but this replacement is great.
B00AN44OKA|5|I love this product! I used OPI base coast and OPI's bunny polich (it's a clearish white polish). Then I did two coats of the glitter polish and one Sally's quick drying top coat.<br /><br />My boyfriend says it looks like jawbreakers and it kind of does! IT's super fun and easy to remove (at least the way i put them on!).
B002AER2FU|5|Best Eyelash glue I have ever used!!! Will buy again and again! It goes on as a vibrant greenish color but dries clear. Helps with the application process since you have to wait for glue to dry up some before applying, you can see when its starting to dry up and become tacky! I have also not had any problems with my lashes coming off, and it does not stay on too much that removal is painful (yes I have had glues do that to me before). The brush tip also make application easy and if you miss a corner, dabbing the brush on the end of your lash (when already applied) makes it extremely easy to do!
B005TNHQMS|5|I really enjoyed this product, but now the cost has gone up significantly.  I find it hard to justify paying 30 bucks for this, but it was good while it lasted.  It has a nice smell to it too.
B008YQ9AD0|5|Lot of great colors, easy to use and I love the small sparkling stones. White and pink acrylic powder just perfect.
B0055J812U|5|good fit - I have very wide nails and they fit just fine. Even on my very wide thumb nail.
B003P85MAM|1|JULY 2, 2013:  I have fine brown hair and it has never been color treated or heavily styled.  I have never had problems with tangles etc, but my scalp does tend to be a little on the greasy side and I need to wash my hair every day.  I really wanted to like this product - it smells nice and feels good when you are applying it.  It also lathers nicely.  When I started using this shampoo, I started to loose hair...not in clumps like some of the other reviewers mentioned, but I was definitely loosing an increased amount of strands per day compared with what I would consider normal daily strand loss.  I thought at first that maybe it was just removing dead or unhealthy hair so I continued to use it to see what happened as I was not loosing a significant amount of hair.  I am now on week number 4 and I continue to lose hair.  The hair loss is starting to be more apparent.  I do not have bald patches and my fiance does not notice a difference in the amount of hair I have (...he is not the type of guy who notices hair changes though...) but I have lost enough hair such that I have to wrap my pony tail holder one more time around than I used to.  Also, my hair becomes tangled as I rinse out the shampoo and, even with conditioner, I get knots.  I am stopping using this product and I will not purchase it again.<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 17, 2013:  I have since switched shampoo and within 5 days of switching I stopped loosing a significant amount of hair strands.  I am now back to almost \\"normal\\" daily strand loss.  As I don't have any medical condition that can contribute to hair loss, and considering the hair loss stopped when I switched shampoo, it is reasonable to conclude that this shampoo made me loose my hair.  Also, the softness and shine of my hair is returning as well; it still becomes tangled but not nearly as bad as when I was using this shampoo.  I recommend you avoid this shampoo.
B000BBF4KO|5|Bought this as a gift for my husband and he says it gave him the best and smoothest shave in a long time. He also has very sensitive skin, prone to bumps and this did not cause that, so I think it's great
B002CIXVVI|4|I used to have serious acne, but I took medication to cease it; however, it commenced to reappear, thus I bought this product. Though it works, it seems not to cure my acne--sadly. It turns out my acne is caused by my unbalanced diet and stress. Though, this product is overall superb--even though it comes in a small amount.
B00B22BCJS|5|Good and soapy and soft it just needs more of a fragrance like different types and its itch free too
B004S7EYE4|5|Will definitely order again.
B007AS62J8|5|These types of towelettes never clean all the make up off my face, but they all do a great job of getting most off. These work about as well as any other natural towelette.<br /><br />But they do work well for clearing acne. I used them every morning to clean my face, tone my skin, and prep my face for acne before applying make up. Great for traveling when I can't bring my raw apple cider vinegar with to kill acne. :)
B0013CSGBE|3|I purchased my Too Faced product through drugstore.com. I really liked it, but I don't wear makeup every day and after a medium stretch of not wearing any I went to put it on and it was all watery (more like oil). I had to squeeze and squeeze on the tube (for quite a long time) and then shook it (again, for quite awhile) really hard and got it back to some semblance of normal consistency. This was my complaint about it -- that it separates. I think I will try the Urban Decay product the next time I buy.
B001B2KXG2|5|I've tried other products but this one works well and looks real.  I put it on before bed & it dried so quickly that arms were dry when I finished with legs.  I put on a second layer! I woke up with a perfect tan.  NO streaks.  Looks real. It would take me weeks in the sun to look this good. I have fair skin and used Medium and it looks great!
B0043OYFKU|4|I am very pleased with Pro-X.  My skin is sensitive and I do not use the product that came with it.  I use my regular facial cleanser with it and I've gotten a deeper cleanse with it.  Great product.
B00JXR0WZ4|3|Too thick and cakey for me. I would have sent it back but there's no option to do so. Perhaps beause it's makeup.
B004U2JVYA|5|I purchased this edge stick it worked well and did what it was described to do I had a little malfunction with my cord and had to send it back:( but with there wonderful customer service and there prompt replies to my emails just gave me that assurance that not only was this a great buy but it was money well spent it's great to spend where the company will do there best to make sure the customers are happy!! They replaced my product with no problems in a fast and timely manor it's hard to find service like this<br />Thanks again
B005LH3X2E|5|delivered as promised
B010GEC0X4|4|lots & lots of curls
B006YPXACU|3|This thing works just OK. After trying it, I think it should be wider, at least the width of an average tongue :)
B000XE961C|5|Great price. I love this scent.
B007MKTAGQ|1|IT WAS BROKE WHEN  I RECECIVED IT
B009BAYE02|1|It's not yellow,  it's orange. They need to correct the listing.
B00B8Z2LRQ|5|Between housework, taking care of an invalid and raising birds....I am very hard on my hands and wash them all through the day. I had \\"acrylic\\" and \\"pink gel\\" nails put on for 25 years.  When I finally decided to give up the false nails, my own were very thin, had ridges, and constantly split, to the point where they were painful and I had to put bandaids on them.<br />I tried the SensatioNAIL system. The gel would peel off quickly, in some places, and then be impossible to take off in other places. It was hard on my nails too.<br />I tried several Sally Hanson products....without success.<br />After 9 months of trying to grow my own....I was ready to give up.<br />And then I found PINK ARMOR.<br />At first I put it on top of the Sensationail gel (that I couldn't get off)....and just kept filling in the gaps as they grew out.  Now it is directly on my bare nails. I have not had a chip, split or break since I started using it. My nails are strong, smooth and beautiful. It stays on until I take it off. I use a white stick under your nails and it looks like a professional French manicure.<br />I paid about $10 for it.  I'd pay 4 times that much......I am so thrilled with it.
B007TV89E2|5|No issues
B002BWOXYE|5|Thank You Roc for continuing to provide products that deliver.  I am in my 50's and have been using Roc Retinol Night Cream for about 6 years and my face is smooth and has an even tone with a youthful glow.  I have tried other pricey face creams that just caused my face to appear dull and I then knew it was time to return to ROC Retinol products.  It really exfolliates dead skin and I have seen age spots disappear.  The night cream was too heavy to wear during the day under makeup.  This ROC Four Zone daytime lotion with SPF is perfect for daytime use.  It goes on smooth and spreads easily and is light enough to wear under makeup.  I highly recommend this product for daytime use and the ROC Nightime cream for nightime use to keep your skin youthful.
B007ZN5ATQ|3|It gets the job done, but does not have a time.
B0090R7WHS|5|Best hair  styling wax! My Husbands hair has never looked better. Plus it smells amazing unlike other products used to style hair. It's also a light weight wax unlike others that weigh the hair down!!!! We Love Magic Move :)
B008PQ5YC0|5|I've heard mixed reviews on various Too Faced products - this is a really good intro to a few things. I loved the Lipgloss and Lashgasm mascara, will probably get the full-sizes. The primer products (shadow and face) worked okay and I hated the Lip Insurance (totally irritated my mouth!)
B003F8Q3UU|5|This scent from Old Spice is very appealing and the deal I got on the 4 pack of anti-perspirant will keep my husband smelling good for months! Highly recommended you stock up as this price is sometimes better than purchasing with coupons in-person.
B00375L8QA|5|i love this cream my skin can actually breath with it on  and the smell is great thats all i can think of to say will purchase agian
B0083IRMAM|5|This flat iron works great and I have had a lot of flat irons.  I've tried CHI, revlon, babyliss, and others that I can't even remember the names of.  This iron surpasses them all.  It leaves my hair smooth and shiny in one pass.  It makes getting ready in the morning fast and easy.
B00117VR1M|5|I absolutely LOVE this perfume!! Lovely smell and cute bottle!
B00R848RZQ|5|Loved this product! Made my skin soft, smooth and helped to tighten my skin. I usually apply this to my face at night after cleansing. Will buy this again.
B000Z5YDO4|5|Dirt Texturizing Paste is probably the least appealing name for a product I've ever encountered, however it doesn't change the fact that it not only works, but works amazingly well.  Yes my friends, my hair tends to stick up and go wild in even the smallest of windstorms, but no matter- this paste is really the ticket to having your hair stay in one place without the frustration (and embarrassment) of having to re-comb it once you step inside.  If you live in the northeast where EXTREMELY windy arctic blasts are a common theme throughout the winter, and you have wild hair that refuses to stay in one place, this is a must buy product.
B0016C0SYO|5|These are the best clippers I have ever used.  And that of itself is saying a lot.  Being a female - The hold is just right for me.      Now my husband love for me to cut his hair -- now that he has a personal barber he think he is going to get a hair cut every week.  A trim - that will work![[ASIN:B0016C0SYO Andis 20140 Hair Clipper/Trimmer Combo Pack]
B007QG7G3U|5|Great product!
B000C1UD4K|5|All my husband wears, LOVE it.
B00GG0I8LQ|5|During the winter months my skin tends to be dry and dull, so keeping it well hydrated is my primary concern. I tried this vitamin c serum for the first time and absolutely love it. It absorbs nicely and made my skin feel super soft. It has even helped brighten my skin tone and get rid of the dull look. I have used other vitamin c serums, which made my skin feel oily, but surprisingly this one doesn't. Overall this is a good product that hydrates and brightens the skin without making it oily.
B00EVCFFEY|5|Love this shampoo and conditioner really helps with dry scalp.  It's like I never had that problem to begin with!
B00MA5E8DI|5|Looks great on
B008H6WLIS|4|Great
B00JEPBLZ0|4|I don't know why this hasn't gotten very good reviews. I really like this kit! I had previously been using the red carpet nails kit and it took me so long to do my nails (over an hour) and I hated it. I got the fuse nailpolishes for christmas but didn't have the light or kit so I bought it on here. At first my light was broken and I was very upset, but as soon as I contacted the seller they sent me a new one immediately. It goes on quick and easy (although a little streaky) and dries to quickly. I have no complaints. People were saying it chips too easily but I completely agree. I actually tried taking it off and found that it wouldn't come off of my nails! LOL I've had pink streaks on my fingernails for weeks now because I can't get all the color off.
B00879RP0E|5|This is one of the best facial masques I have ever used. It leaves your skin clean and refreshed. I have combination skin and it works well for me. I love this product!
B006JKX5TS|5|I honestly went online to make this purchase after MUCH research! I am happy to report that I LOVE this makeup!!!!
B0075GXW0W|5|he also love the finishing creme wen is a great product.
B005TK9KGQ|4|This tanning  spray is veryl effective and tans immediately.  However, a slight odor does existentiële. I would buy it againand the prices is good
B009HULKLW|5|Very very happy with this product!!  This is exactly what I wanted.  My hair is natural  and I was able to do heat-less  curls  that lasted for the week. My sister and mom have purchased some of their own now  :-). I have wanted these for a long time but Ididn't want to pay the price. With this set you get 40 for the low. These are stupid expensive at  the beaty supply so this is a much better option yo get the same thing for cheap.
B00JNL58SG|1|The bristles were too soft and completely ineffective.
B0013CSGCS|5|I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and actually had to Google how to use a hair mask (my first time). Now, I feel like I'm spoiled forever! Never has my hair felt so soft.<br /><br />I had colored my hair probably about 2-3 weeks prior to using this sample and my hair had been feeling quite dry/brittle -- especially at the ends. I applied the mask and left on for 3-5 minutes before using the shampoo/conditioner.<br /><br />The first thing I remember was the scent. Lovely! (You know how it smells when you're in the salon, having your hair washed and you think how much you love the scent of the hair products? It's like that.) Then, the lather. It seriously feels like silk!<br /><br />After styling, I was even more thrilled with the products. My hair felt amazing! Not a hint of the dry/brittle feeling I'd been experiencing. I'm not sure I'd be able to purchase and use these regularly due to the price point, but all three are definitely going on my holiday wish list!
B0001MLI8K|1|Don't bother! The tip is way too thick on these tweezers and you pinch your skin (ouch!) all the time much more than you can grab an annoying hair. I got both tips (slanted and pointed) and nahhh. Don't waste your money. Really, don't. Tried TWEEZERMAN also and not only are they not long lasting they are made of a soft alloy metal so if you drop them even on a rug on the tips, for-ged-about-it. They say they sharpen them back for free but they are never the same, and then they solicit you to buy more! Never will by them again either. Still on the search for a good pair of tweezers. But these TNT's...no thanks.
B000050B6U|5|Replaced my last one of 8 years ---the best iron and inexpensive!
B00ANW4LLY|5|AAAAAA +++
B00NY5NGPE|4|this product is good,hopefully with time of use,the wrinkles will be minimized.
B00ARF42H0|4|Satisfactory
B00SKHFPN2|5|I have been looking for a case just like this. wish the card holder in the back was bigger but it will do.
B008RGTHHQ|2|I was told that this stuff would be a great natural insect repellent so that is the whole reason I bought it.  It did not work on repelling insects for me.  It actually seemed to attract them and I got more bites than normal while using this stuff.<br /><br />As a bath oil it is fine and probably deserves more like 3 stars.  The smell is woodsy and not my favorite.  The cap just turns on and off so it is difficult to control how much comes out without pouring a whole bunch out.  I ended up spilling a ton all over my nightstand because of this.
B0016N3T3K|4|Have used this product for years.  The only objection is the blush container gets smaller every couple of years,  Same price for smaller amount
B000PSRHQ2|5|The daisy shape makes the sponge easy to hold and use. I especially like the texture: great for exfoliating, but smooth enough to use for washing.  The lavender/lemon scent doesn't last beyond about fifteen uses. The soap will last longer when used with your own soap/body wash.  I'm still using the sponge after more than a month's use, and it is showing no wear and tear. This unique all-in-one product is a perfect gift for others and yourself.
B004N73POE|5|I love this product! Evens out perfectly, and is fool proof! Also everyone can be dark! I've used this on fair to dark, and its always perfect! I own my own salon, and this is the only color I keep! If customers want natural, I just use 2 coats.
B003KWO3UI|4|Definitely a good razor in its own right, but after using the powered, vibrating Proglide, it's hard to switch back. Maybe I became lazy from use or some other cause, but I actually had a few nicks when trying this one out the first time, but uses after that went well and I'm happy with it.
B008YQM44C|5|I received my sample from Influenster. Luckily I grabbed it to take with me on a 16 hour round trip drive that turned into a 3 day trip due to an unexpected blizzard. If it hadn't been for this mounthwash I don't know what I would have done to keep my teeth clean. This mouthwash saved the day! I used it as a rinse and also dipped washcloths in it and scrubbed my teeth with it. Unlike a lot of other mouthwash's I did not find this to be overbearing and can use it on a regular basis.
B0085YK6P2|1|I didnt like because its good quality of nail polish. I need to put 5 layers to see the color.
B00009OL68|5|I used a battery powered waterpik for a couple of years and the battery seemed to get weaker as well as the pump pressure.<br /> Don't have that problem with the plug in kind.
B00BF0DXPI|5|Arrid has always kept me drier than any other brand.
B007RTR8UC|2|I found that this product added a slightly greasy feel to my hair and DID NOT leave me with a clean feeling as advertised.  Not impressed with this product at all as the last thing I want to use is a product that makes my hair feel LESS clean...
B00889F0ZK|5|Love my diffuser just wish it lasted longer
B000EG8HLE|5|Excellent product, and easy to use and clean!!  I am entirely satisfied with this product !!
B001EJOQGK|5|Great toothpaste
B004DHYZU2|4|The first time I had this on my hair, my hairdresser put it on me. she said she liked to use it on her client's hair and I really liked it on mine so when I saw that I could get it on Amazon for a lot less money than I could have bought it at the beauty salon, I ordered it. I like the way it styles and controls my hair without leaving it stickey or stiff.
B0027LSEPS|4|Only weakness is the amount of fluid it holds. Need to fill twice to finish cleaning.
B000BBS636|5|This dryer is great.  I've bought myself and a family member one as well.  Both of us are pleased with the drying time as we both have thick hair.  I recommend this product for people who are really looking for a powerful hair dryer.
B00C7DYBX0|5|I'm impressed by the entire OZ line of anti-aging products. The Hyaluronic acid serum was easy to use, smelled great, and made short work of the beginning wrinkles on my face. The crows feet were always lightish, but now they're invisible!<br /><br />You should know that my skin isn't sensitive. It's rare for anything to have a negative result on my skin - take this into account when using any anti-aging serum.<br /><br />I receive a lot of products (as I did this) for review, and there aren't many I can recommend without hesitation. This is one of them. Absolutely love it! I'll definitely be back for more.
B005J6FGUE|3|Good foundation. It does not make my skin sticky like some others. It is very thin, so I have to use a lot more drops to get full coverage.
B000VVT94G|4|I've been using these clippers for just about everything from keeping my head hair short, trimming my face and eyebrows, and even my own overly hairy chest and back hair.<br />  These clippers in the last 18-months have been well worth the money!<br />  I would have given them a 5-star rating but for the price you would think they could have included some length attachments even though they are primarily for keeping your head shaved clean.<br />  Another word of advice too I would give is make sure you ALWAYS use the \\"balding attachment\\" as the blades against the scalp (or other body parts) are sharp enough to cut away some skin which is very painful to have learned the hard way.
B000ALDK1A|1|Looks like 100% aloe vera gel, but isn't.  Didn't work at all.  Ordered the lidocaine version from the same company and it healed right away plus no pain.
B00KCFAZTE|1|Went through one bottle, didn't do anything for my eyes. Still look tired
B0091W09SG|5|Good price, delivery time and good condition! Thanks!
B005HO0A1S|5|Great price. I'm not sure if I could've got cheaper at Costco or Sam's, but I didn't have to leave my house to find out.
B004CR43GY|5|I have very oily skin and get deep pimples around my jawline from stress.  This product keeps my skin clear, soft and even toned.  I first tried it in the travel package for oily skin.  I am hooked on the results.
B0087OYZFW|5|I first encountered at Space NK.  I recently used in a new way on some very long haul international flights after getting the idea from a Lisa Eldridge video.  Before boarding, I took off all makeup and applied the mask and left in on til about halfway thru the flight (7 hours), washed off and repeated. When I arrived, my skin was plump and hydrated and it also acted as a shield against the dirty cabin air.  I
B0036Z1HFS|5|I use the mild rice cleanser and after going through many products this is by far one of the best.  It is fresh and without all the chemicals that we don't need on our skin. I love the mini granules in it that also help exfoliate your skin.  I also use the day and night cream and the clay mask. They are all really great. My skin is bright and not dull at all after using these products even in the cold winter months.  They have great customer service as well and my products are delivered in a timely fashion.
B00120VWJ0|5|I bought it for bathing my dogs but my dad was in love with the product since he read the label and try it on his hair. I love the product, my dogs loves it and my dad loves it too :)
B009EFG358|5|The one and only..
B002UD52WQ|5|This seems to be the same product as I receive from my stylist.  It has worked really good for me.
B00JY1014Q|1|I was about to try it on when the strap broke off from one side.  It's probably an easy fix, but it's still a hassle.  The material feels nice, but I haven't used it because I haven't had time to fix it.  You get what you pay for, I suppose.
B00AFCOWB6|5|The Venus & Olay Razor is simply amazing! My daughter and I both have sensitive skin. So with that in mind,  I will admit that I was a bit hesitant about using this new razor, but much to my amazement, it didn't bother us one bit! We both now have the softest legs, I think we've ever had! If you have sensitive or dry skin then, this is the razor for you!
B002OGJPFY|1|I absolutely loved this perfume but the last recent order I was very disappointed -- it was not the same fragrance.  I don't know what happened to this perfume but the aroma was way off.  I will no longer purchase this perfume and am disappointed -- it always drew compliments but either the manufacturer changed something or the bottle I purchased happened to be a knock-off.  Total waste of money -- will not purchase again!
B004D2C4Q4|4|I am 44 and have lived in the Caribbean for the past six years, so am quite concerned about sun damage and wrinkles. I regularly use Neutrogena's Healthy Skin line (day cream with spf, night cream, and eye cream) which contains some retinol and is easy to find in the few drug stores on island.    I did really like the Rapid Wrinkle Repair night formula. It was lightweight and smelled pleasant. The first few nights I had a bit of irritation, but nothing scary.     Now I don't love this enough to make a special ordeal of getting it. The Healthy Skin products work as well for normal use. However, I do plan to buy this when I am back living in NY.
B003JK0Y04|5|I was pleasently surprise how nice this wig looks on.  It arrived in a timely fashion, and I loved the color.  The length is perfect and looks natural. I do recommend this product.
B002RS6JW6|5|I use this hair product to keep my hair in place over a long day. This is the hardest hair spray that I have tried and it performs well in that capacity. I would not use it if you want that natural or matte look to your hair. It gives a light shine that makes it very obvious that you have product in your hair. This is not a bad thing but it might be different than some people are looking for. For a guy, combine with some shaping paste.. Use the paste to achieve the style you're looking for then spray to keep it in place all day!
B00GH18RII|1|That is good product, but too hard for my skin.<br />Keeps my skin very tense all day long and that feeling is very uncomfortabel
B000UVZU1S|4|I love this nice, basic moisturizer. It absorbs well and feels great on my skin. My only complaint is that it doesn't contain sunscreen so I only use it at night.
B002XYJ106|4|These are alot smaller then I was expecting but they serve purpose for my nail tips. Glad I ordered them!
B008XLEXRO|4|Everything was good. Working well<br />Except the strips. I don't know whether if it's too thin or something else, when applied honey on skin, honey went thru the strip so it became all sticky. So it was hard to use
B00CDSTTG8|5|Unbelievable hold, even in our Florida humidity!  Doesn't leave hair totally stiff and brushes out easily...best hairspray ever!
B00DYZ7ZCO|5|good
B000052YBA|1|Years ago I used this product around some widely spaced teeth I had and I loved it. I bought some recently after many years and it is clearly NOT the same product! I recently got two implant bridges and the dentist told me to use Super Floss to clean around the implant posts. The threader is flimsy and the spongy part is not nearly as thick. Instead get TePe Bridge and Implant Floss. It has a sturdy threader and thick, durable spongy floss.
B006T8BWUE|4|I use this product for years. Just found the price is even better then grocery store.<br />Will order again next time.
B00022WA9K|3|I had to return this because the handle is so big that I couldn't use it.  I have medium size hands and it was just too large and hard to handle.My hair is short and the brushes were too big.
B00I48BHSO|4|I love the color and the shipping was great<br />it was wrapped up and the package  was sucure
B004ALIOZ8|5|Works really well for eliminating bags and puffiness the eyes.
B0026IBSVE|5|excelente
B003EA24MK|3|I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap & may receive perks & rewards as a member. This product is effective for removing hair in unwanted areas, but after the hair was removed, I noticed that some areas were left with irritation, a rash, or red bumps. I will blame this on the skin being more sensitive in some areas, however I strongly recommend you test the product out before you use it and then believe you can go about your business as the irritation can cause some itching.
B00FYPL4NS|5|I tried this hair color last week and I just love it.  I received it free to try and evaluate.  I was very impressed with this product.  There is a pretreatment to use first and then apply hair color.  This is the first product I have used that did not drip or run.  There is a conditioner included which smells amazing.  This product covered my stubborn greys at the hairline and did not leave my hair corse or brittle.  I highly recommend this product.
B0020MMD06|5|This perfume smells incredible.. I'm normally a marc jacobs ~ michael kors girl... but omg I love this!!!
B00BB5YHEI|4|I bought this for my son.  It is his only tool for shaving.  He said the trim bar is awkward to use.
B002ZIOJE8|5|i bought this for my boyfriend! second time around!!<br />He loves it and it smells great.<br />plus it lasts for months, even though he has a lot of hair.<br /><br />Very good product, you wont regret the buy
B00L96QF9O|2|I wish i can see more pictures.
B001ET78BU|5|I have curly hair and this is my go to leave in conditioner. Very moisturizing.
B000GG61R4|4|It does not say in the description product must be used up completely in 30 days. Otherwise product seem to work fine.
B0007CXQUW|3|The Tweeze does pull hairs, but it doesn't get every one you can feel, like their advertisement says.  If they are very short, it doesn't grab them, and going over the same spot too much just irritates the skin.  It does hurt a bit, but no more than tweezers.
B0013TVEWA|5|This is my second Sonic electric toothbrush.  I finally wore the first one out after years of great service.  I was so impressed by the great cleaning job it did, I bought ones for my wife, both sons and my mother.  Can't get a better endorsement than that.
B003WR3QSG|5|great item, does not shed like some I have used in the past .
B002ZG94UY|4|After about a month I can now see my stretch marks slowly fading, Mederma works great! I would definitely recommend it to anyone with new stretch marks.
B000EVGQ8U|5|Great price, and convenience!!
B006W2SYHG|5|Bought this for my son and he like it
B003BXAYI6|5|We bought 10 for Christmas presents last year and may do same for next year, since popular we had to buy from several different suppliers.
B000KJVL0Y|5|I have been using Monoi Tiare Tahiti Shampooing au Monoi Gardenia for 8 or 9 years now, and I love it! This shampoo is wonderful for removing excess product from your hair, leaving it very clean. It has a heavenly but very light fragrance that lingers just a little. I was first hooked on this shampoo because of its aura, but kept returning to it because of it's ability to deep cleanse my hair. It lathers well in hard water, and rinses out easily, leaving no residue like some conditioning shampoos. This is NOT a conditioning shampoo, so a good conditioner of your choice is recommended to use after you rinse.<br />I tried the Monoi Tiare Tahiti Shower Gel: it has a completely different scent, and is not as pleasing as this shampoo, despite the claim that it contains the Gardenia fragrance.<br />This shampoo makes a wonderful gift for a friend going on a 'beach themed' vacation: the aroma is light but exotic, which will appeal to many people!<br />I buy through Amazon, since the price here is very good, and shipping is super-fast.<br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Note Well:<br />For those of the Boomer Generation:  This is NOT the heavy patchouli, frangipani or ylang-ylang scent - the kind you experienced in oil or incense form at many music venues in the '70s!
B002ECVMWM|5|I really like this cleanser. It really does reduce redness. I was surprised about that.<br /><br />My skin is less dried out since I started using this. I used to use the standard Neutrogena acne wash (the orange colored stuff--it also worked well), I think this green one makes my skin more moisturized.<br /><br />Its acne-reduction properties are also good--my skin is staying clear.
B00871KLJ4|5|I do my own nails at home and save a ton. I but the tips, and the glue and acrylic powder. Takes me about an hour and lasts 2-3 weeks depending on how diligent I am with wearing my gloves when doing housework.
B003983HZK|5|Greatest blades ever.
B004Q8GYES|4|I bought this for my sister. She loves it. I haven't actually used it on my face but I tried the speeds out. There are too speeds which is nice. I fits perfectly in the palm of my hand.
B000NQ93BI|5|quick service  good product
B00FP2NDHA|5|My girlfriend loved it
B001DFVJU6|4|Ideal for any electric razor brand, long lasting can
B00CVDTMI0|5|Love these they are perfect love every color
B009AYF7AK|5|I have a ton of hair and hairbands never hold up. They always stretch out or break. These hold tight and do not break! Fabulous
B0002RUM90|5|I would HIGHLY recommend Nail Envy.  I too removed my acrylic nails after many years due to just being sick of having the burden of fills, cost, etc. I happened to go to a local beauty supply and was recommended Envy. I did research on the internet and decided to give it a try. First you apply two coats and then every other day apply another coat and once a week remove and start again.  I could see a difference within the week and now at a month's time, my nails have grown and are no longer brittle, soft or breaking.  The salesperson at the beauty supply said to apply Opi Nail Envy-Brittle Nails after finishing the bottle of Envy because after time, it might not work as well.  I do not usually write reviews, but this product is truly VERY good, bit pricey but again, WORTH IT!
B00176GT60|1|I opened the box, the tested out the iron and everything seemed to be fine.  Unfortunatley I did not keep my receipt once I thought the product was ok, 1-2 later I went to use the iron again and there must have been a small crack I did not see when I first opened the box, the whole top piece split right down the middle...broken in two so it is completely unusable!!
B0007ZAK58|5|These shears were 20% higher everywhere I looked. They are very sharp and do the job great on my Newfoundland dog. The brand was recommended by a groomer. Worth the price.
B000F4USF8|4|I bought this one to replace a Phillips trimmer I previously had.  The Phillips trimmer worked great, but the plastic blade guard (also an on-board adjustable type) was too delicate, and in my travels, the plastic fingers of the blade guard easily broke after a few trips; I then learned a replacement on-board adjustable guard was more than this entire Panasonic trimmer.  This Panasonic trimmer is better than the Phillips trimmer in that cheaper (I paid $20 & got free shipping) it is more durably constructed (waterproof, stronger blade guards, etc), and the single-piece charging unit for this Panasonic trimmer is more convenient than the plug & cord type that comes with most other trimmers, like my old Phillips trimmer.  From my searching there is no perfect trimmer out there, but this is the best trimmer for me, I travel all the time, and this one is durable and gets the job done, and if it breaks... it was only $20 to begin with.  But if you're just trimming at home and not traveling with your, check out the Phillips trimmers, which are about 3X the price, but charge faster and run faster (the Phillips model cuts hair about 30% faster than this one).
B003TQU1Q0|5|The rigth product to moisturize and relief my itchy skin. I use it everyday and the result is awsome. No odor.
B001BH0A1A|5|I was a little hesitant about buying this after reading all the reviews, but with Amazons easy 30 day return policy I figured I didn't have anything to lose. I'm SOOO glad I ordered this!! I have blue eyes, and dark blonde or very light brown hair. I have always tanned very easily, and this works very well for me! I don't have an orange color- or super dark brown color either. What I do have is nice color or my face, décolletage, and shoulders, upper arms. I am very, very, happy with this product!:-)  I use a medical tanning light for the rest of my body.
B001MA0QY2|5|Totally brilliant.
B003EMVVMM|5|These are the best blades around by far.  Unfortunately they are pretty pricey but they do a great job without cutting my skin.
B00LYLJJO2|5|This is one gorgeous, quality set of tweezers. I set the fine-tips to work performing dodgy self-surgery on the sole of my foot where a particularly annoying little splinter had been hiding and taunting me all week. I'd tried to root it out with standard splinter-tweezers and it just snickered at me. Well, it didn't stand a chance against the laser-sights of these tweezers, and came out whimpering in surrender.<br /><br />The slanted set are excellent precision eyebrow tweezers. You might want a more rough-and-tumble set for the first whack through the brush, but once you have the shape in, these are exactly what you need to edge the lawn to perfection. The precision and finish quality is awesome on these - a mile better than Tweezerman, which seem like blunt little kid's toys by comparison. The black cord in my photos is one of those tiny little thin things used to attach cell phone charms - the photos are highly magnified.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.
B001D4YDKU|5|Love everything about this soap. I even use it for shaving and shampoo.
B00T8ZOB7Q|1|This scent lasted all of ten minutes from when I sprayed it on my skin ?? I dont know if I received a bad bottle or what, but I wont order it again.
B008VW1BOS|5|Loved the individual scents, usually there are a bunch of horrible smelling things and then one you like.  Wasn't the case here.<br /><br />The oils seemed to be good quality, scents were strong, no need to overuse.  Worked well in my water based air purifier.  Totally would recommend this to aromatherapy enthusiasts!
B000050FDQ|2|I've had the 7526 for almost two years now.  The shave is average, but the cost of consumables has been what I feel is high.  Besides the cleaning cartridges (at approx $4.50/ea), I've had to replace cutterheads twice in the two years.  The foil wears through exposing the cutters making replacement necessary.  Given their replacment cost, I figure they should last longer than 8 months.....  I'd been a Norelco user for a long time prior to the Braun, and I'll soon be switching back....
B00F4VX9G2|5|Super
B002O0D8P8|4|Haven't used long enough to rate yet
B00BVA4IB0|5|This wig is a cute little cut for the summer! The bangs can be styled to either side which I love... I've worn the color shown and get lots of compliments! ***Very Fast Delivery***
B00A4U4TIK|1|This was sop posed to be blonde.  It's red.  So of course there is no match for my costume. Disappointing.
B004H3QCPS|1|Not working for me, my scar was 3 year olds, after use the whole tube, nothing change!
B004VMGTVW|5|best lotion ever! for someone who is always on the search for the perfect moisturizer- i've been through them all- natural lotions, organic lotions, coconut oil, almond oil, grapeseed, etc...this is hands down the best moisturizing lotion out there. i have read reviews that talk about the &#34;new formula&#34; smelling awful, or not liking it because of the addition or subtraction of ingredients---i cannot compare this lotion to those statements, because this is the first time i have tried it- but i will say i am on my second bottle and i keep a smaller version for travel. i will not leave home without it. i personally like the scent, and i have an aversion to a lot of &#34;smells&#34;, especially of body care products. to me it smells like honey, which i happen to love.  i keep one at my job as well, which requires me to wash my hands a lot. my skin quality all over has improved significantly. it leaves my skin so soft and is easily absorbed. i usually apply directly after a shower....it claims to be a &#34;24-hour moisturizer&#34;, but i would go further and state that it lasts longer than that.  i also mix a bit of this lotion with some pure Aubrey Organics aloe vera that i keep in the fridge and apply it to my face at night. it has not clogged my pores or cause any breakouts. i do routinely wash my face with raw honey, and i think this helps keep breakouts at bay, as well. it's only fitting that i use the milk & honey lotion on the rest of my body! :-) this is a really great moisturizer! the only one i will use!
B006TURZ3U|2|dries out my hair and doesn't make it more voluminous.  a waste of money!
B00T8GRNKC|4|I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks now and I am very happy with it. I have sensitive skin and often have a problem with similar products, but have had no problems with this one. It absorbs well but does not leave my face oily or cause dryness. My skin feels firmer but it's hard to really tell at this point. It does make my face feel very smooth and soft. I will continue to use it and post updates if any thing changes. Also, you only need a small amount, as it spreads nicely and very evenly. I'm happy with it. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the product does not have the percent of retinal listed. I'm hoping this will be added in the future.
B00KNDE3A2|5|Love it
B0051V1EQW|5|can't take off my gel polish without it Best product ever !!!!!!!!!!
B003P6VHE4|1|The color was fine and it blended well. But it broke out my skin so bad. Almost gave me hives.
B00M7EWOOW|5|Fast shipping from amazon, nice test paper for perfume tester, good quality reasonable price Thanks
B00C2P3JO0|5|Been using 4 long time...good 4 sensitive skin
B003SSXDUA|5|As a commitmentphobe, I have a hard time deciding on a permanent tattoo design.  I wanted to try out some fun designs just to see if I could live with a tat forever.  The variety of tats is really great -- lots of color and traditional designs.  They are easy to apply and look pretty good.  Best of course on taut skin. They look pretty good -- they look like real tattoos, until you get really close -- then look a little wrinkly (just from skin's natural texture.  Several that I tried looked a little faded -- just like a real tat.  A lot of fun for an inexpensive pack of temp tats.
B0047ERRHO|4|I use this lipstick almost every day.  Not quite as creamy as I would have  liked  and more of an orange-red that real red but still a good color and the lipstick stays on.
B0045A7BK8|5|This hand cream was recommended to me by a doctor. It works really well, a small amount goes a long way.  The main difference and advantage of this cream versus others is that it is not sticky. After you apply this cream, your skin feel smooth and nicely moisturized. It does not have any unwanted scent either. Last, but not least, this hand cream is made in U.S.A. Love it!
B001WAKUUC|4|My eyelashes were getting sparse, I used this for 2 weeks, I quit using it cuz it does work! Makes the eyes real red if you get it in your eyes, so be so careful! It works wonders on the eyebrows too! Fixes sparse eyebrows & lashes!
B00A35XQO4|2|Ok not very good quality
B00LVPDBA4|5|This is my first electric toothbrush. Good experience and easy to use.
B001E763CW|5|Wonderful product--skin feels wonderful!  Thanks, Vani!
B00QAZ7VDS|5|Amazing! Soft, smoothe, and smells great
B00015XAQ0|5|Awesome product!  Works great and smells wonderful!
B00028M3N2|5|I was worried this would smell fake like lemon scented floor cleaner but this is NOT the case.<br /><br />I use 4oz per 8lb batch of soap.  It smells great and arrived with good packaging.
B006R3CORG|5|This is an awesome color! Really deep color with a shimmer....love it!
B00JVV2VSI|1|Not a fan! I've used bareMinerals for maybe fifteen years or more so I was excited to try this new foundation. It's probably the messiest liquid foundation I've ever tried. First of all, it says to shake the bottle before applying but once it's shaken and you take the top off there is makeup ALL over and it creates such a mess. Second, as others have said, this stuff stinks. Not bad coverage but it doesn't smooth out easily. I won't use it anymore.
B005DNBLPC|5|I bought this primarily for my hair.  I have thick wavy hair that tends to frizz.  I put this in my shampoos and use it on my hair after I blow dry, before I use a curling iron or straight iron.  This has helped the health of my hair.  Nothing can fix my split ends I already have but this helps new ones from occurring.  I also use it straight on my super dry under-eye area.  Absorbs quick and keeps my eye area hydrated.  I do put another eye cream on top of it.
B000SQV03W|5|I had ordered some from Walgreens, they were not the same product. This item is far better! Will ored again when needed!
B00GGGZB4C|5|I use this serum all the time, it's very good. The price was good, it was wrapped well in the box so it would not break. The only problem the protective plastic seal was missing when arrived.
B000W9Y3VQ|2|I have a love/hate relationship with celebrity perfumes.  I love lots of them (the Britney Spears one, the Hilary Duff one, several of J. Lo's) but I'm often not a huge fan of the celebrities involved.  And I'm not a huge Mariah Carey fan, but given that I've enjoyed other celebrity perfume scents I was willing to give this a go.  Unfortunately, I don't care for the scent any more than I care for Mariah Carey.  This smells like cake to me- cake with musky notes. The cake note are more prominent at first, then it becomes more musky.  Cake and musk are just two things that (at least for me) should not go together.  If you like cake smells, I'm sure this is great, but cake is not very popular with me.  So, I'm not very fond of this, but foody fans might well like it.
B001LF4BD0|5|great product....been using it since my husband bought it for a joke on my 50th............i guess the joke is on him
B003A874R6|5|Perfect for the necessary touch up
B00M1E54Q8|5|best yet used norelco shavers since 1960 and this is the best yet not to sure about the clean tank but so far so good some people don't like change
B000GCLU42|5|I had recurring MRSA infections for about one year. Each time doctor prescirbed a new antibiotic, but upon finishing the course boils always returned and situation got worse and worse. Thank God I found Hibiclens, it's a life saver. No more antibiotics for my MRSA. I use it every 2 weeks or so and it has been three months of no skin infections.
B00AKHG6WO|5|Small, cute, very convenient. For people who are in the car a lot this is great, im using it to get ready for the mayday parade concert in the parking lot before i go in
B00363G2S2|3|Looks like I pressed my lips in flour, almost white. I'm still very tan so I'm hoping with my winter coloring it will be better.
B00N69H1C2|5|Excellent product.  Took on bus trip. Would recommend, however, rather costly.
B0015NZ6FK|1|Cheaply made. Does not fit my head. Can still see light. A total piece of junk.
B002S8PTMQ|1|Really disappointed with these shadow palettes. I bought 3 and never use any of them. I wouldn't buy them again at any price. They're powdery, dont wear well even with a primer or cream shadow base. I'm basing this review on my extensive experience with eye products. I own many palettes and singles, from high end to low end. These are, by far, some of the WORST products I've ever tried.<br /><br />Disappointing & surprising as I own other NYX products - like their eye shadow singles, jumbo eye shadow pencils, powder blushes & cream blushes - and love them. These are just rubbish compared to their other products. Pure junk. What a waste of money.
B000E3YPIG|5|Love this product!
B007W59PXY|4|I still have wig on.Though it is synthetic,it has last for 3 month
B000C238JG|4|This is a good buy because you get the cream and the fragrance and it smells wonderful.  I liked this alot, I give it four stars.
B001B0YMB6|5|got it for my mother for her birthdat i opened it to make sure it wasnt broken or anything and its great and id love one for myelf looks justlike it does in the picture too
B0012ZSZY0|5|We buy this for a retirement home and believe me it gets used a lot. Helps pain of arthritis fast. It is a little pricey but worth every penny. I highly recommend its purchase.
B004UA2RYI|5|I have not used it as yet but I did use some from a friend and it was great. I know that I will be ordering more of Palmer's products.
B00NVGK7E4|4|So far, I really like the Vitamin C serum.  I hope to see even better results after a full month.
B000N2OC5Y|5|Super quick shipping. Good product.
B003XDVER4|1|Wish i could rate zero stars. I got this from a friend who is a dentist. I asked for some oral care products and he sent a big grab bag for me.<br /><br />I wasn't planning on using this toothpaste but I left my Sensodyne behind while traveling. I used this toothpaste twice today. I didn't like the flavor. I used it at 4:30 because my mouth needed refreshening and it left a bitter taste. I used it again before I went on a date at around 8:30 pm. I asked the waitress to bring a big water for me and I guzzled it because my mouth was so dry and bitter. I am guessing that by 9:30 or so my mouth discomfort elevated and hurt so much. It seemed like the food was hurting my mouth because it just kept getting worse and the food was so unpleasant to feel in my mouth. I was trying to eat a mild quiche I have had many times, creamy and far from assaulting and causing mouth pain. I felt like I had been rubbing my tongue on my teeth all day or that feeling of a burn from pineapple enzymes. I thought that I might have had more stress than I realized today and perhaps didn't notice rough tongue movements because my tongue was just so sore and it was getting worse all along the sides, especially where my tongue rests on my bottom molars.<br /><br />Not long after I got home did I realize that I have huge canker sores and painful white bumps all along my tongue. They weren't there this morning and I realized that all day I enjoyed the feeling of a cheek bite that was finally all healed. In other words my mouth felt good and free from irritation before I opened this toothpaste at 4:30. My tongue really hurts now and my cheek lining is peeling. The spot where my newly healed bite was is now swollen and skin i hanging off of it. This is a total chemical burn and irritation.<br /><br />In the morning I plan on going to the grocery store and buying Benadryl Elixer and Milk of Magnesia to make an oral rinse solution that stops tongue pain from burns and cankers and other things that make tongues sore like thrush. This is first aid for your tongue and it will stop your pain while you heal.<br /><br />Seriously, if your tongue and mouth and lips became sore and your mucosa sloughed off after use, you got burned and you deserve some first aid. I don't plan on suffering for one minute after the store opens. I will be rinsing my mouth out with anti inflammatory Benadryl and Milk Of Magnesia first thing in the morning.<br /><br />I have had inflammatory issues most of my life, including skin inflammation so perhaps that is why this product harmed my mouth so fast. I swell from injuries and sometimes a small irritation will cause a sore on my skin because my blood inflammation levels are very high.  However lots of people have inflammatory issues that they may or may not be aware of and so I think there is a big risk being burned immediately or irritated after several uses of this product for anyone, especially those with inflammatory issues such as allergies, digestive issues and rheumatoid arthritis, etc.
B000052WYQ|5|Works great!
B000UES66Q|5|Not only does it taste great, but since there is no Sodium Laureth Sulfate in it, there is no lingering aftertaste.
B0059GMCS8|5|a bargain
B000IOQ84U|5|This cream is very light and leaves you with clean feeling of the skin. It was recommended by my dermatologist because I have many sun damage spots that are very dry. This cream takes care of them. This is my second time I buy this cream and I love it. I wish the company would give discount coupons to their repeat customers.
B00BROQU8Y|4|These come in a ton of cool colors and they are very pretty. However, they stretch out super fast so be prepared to buy them again soon.
B00HV1AH4U|5|this stuff is great!  not to heavy, and not to light.  it perfectly conditions my hair, even after i was having issues with my scalp being dry over the winter.  my husband loves it, too!
B00EB03MXM|5|I absolutely Loved that it was perfect for traveling. Purse sized and ready to go, Gotta have my Pink Sugar!!
B00GQU5YY0|2|First off the bristles of the brush are too soft. The brush is more useful as a lipstick brush than an eyeliner brush. The gel eyeliner itself is not as thick, so it comes off easy, doesn't last. The plus side, it glides on easily. For the price, it's good. I gave it to my teenage daughter.
B00005REAQ|5|I love this stuff - SPF, great moisture, use in winter and summer.  Perfect size, smells great, not too greasy, great price.
B00R46FGDO|5|Ah yes, the Viking beard.  Those wild and woolly growths of hair that are thick, wiry, and unruly.  Mine was red and blond in my younger days but has reverted to white at my advanced age--but it is still heavy and hard to tame, much fuller and stronger than the remaining hair on my head.  No matter how I trim it, there is no particular length that is easier to style.  Different parts of my beard seem to have a mind of its own.  Some of it is straight, other areas are curly, and the hair growing out of my nose and ears is long and silky.  It's too bad that nose and ear hair are not highly prized by the females of our species, because I would be in great demand. But I digress.<br /><br />So when Mr. Rugged offered me a free sample to try on one of the toughest beards in existence, I jumped at the chance.  I have tried a lot of hair products but that seems to be part of the problem.  This Mr. Rugged Beard Balm is thicker and has more substance than regular hair products. All you have to do is take about a dime sized amount of the product, place it in the palm of your hand, and rub your hands together until it goes from the initial \\"vaseline type consistency\\" to a more liquid form.  Then work it into your beard and comb with your favorite brush.  The results are far better than anything else I've tried, so much so that I'm truly impressed.  I've read that others have encountered \\"little white balls\\" in their formula that can be eliminated by simply placing it in the palm of your hand and rubbing it until the formula turns liquid.  In Southwest Florida it's usually hot enough to keep those white balls from forming so no problem there.<br /><br />I've also found that Mr. Rugged Beard Balm works well in styling my pony tale and keeping the seven or eight hairs involved nicely matted together.  Just a side benefit, but who doesn't like multi-use products?
B0086VI9LC|5|I have purchased these many times for myself and my daughter.  They are perfect for our Sonicare units.  I just purchased another sonicare toothbrush and it fits that one too!  Very satisfied.
B00G7SGYUY|3|Rather oily and it took quite a bit of effort to take polish off.
B00CBW6VIU|5|My daughter who is about to turn 2 in a few weeks, had her ears pierced at 2 months old. Everything was awesome until about 9 months ago when she began pulling her earrings out. We tried every thing we could find, including screw on backs but they were no feat for her. We finally found these and we've had them a week and she has yet to be able to remove them! Usually we couldn't keep earrings in for more than 5 minutes. Huge victory for us. I am SO excited to have found these.
B005C5FP9Y|1|no directions this came in a week but does not work don't waste your money they are cheap but not for something the girls wont use.
B005IHEA7Y|1|Returned no quality at all.
B004KEUXTK|1|I had to return it because it was watery and difficult to apply. I was very disappointed and felt there advertisement was not accurate.
B00GMP502K|5|Love this product. My hair dresser recommended that I use a dry shampoo because my hair tends to get very oily at the roots. It was getting dried out though because I was washing it every day. I tried a lot of different dry shampoos but they all left a powdery/ gray color at the roots of my dark brown hair. I couldn't stand it! Then I found this stuff...and I LOVE IT! Now I wash my hair every other day and use this religiously. It is just the right color so it blends right in. I do have to be careful not to run my hands through my hair too much on the days that I use it because the color can come off on the fingernails. I figure that is a good thing though, cause you really shouldn't do that anyway and it is probably part of the reason for the excessive oily roots.
B001V9LUXA|5|Wonderful! I love it. Thank you for the fast delivery too.
B002RGRJC2|5|I swear by these products. I absolutely love them. I use them as my regular shampoo but they're so good that very little goes a long way. They leave my hair silky and smooth.
B00BNB3AT8|5|I think this is really good with the different variety that they have. I recommend this to people if you like doing make-up ​
B007BPJ33C|5|Have used various products over the years, many more highly touted (marketed) and more expensive.  Alterna Bamboo offers a product that applies easily, doesn't 'grease' or mat your hair, and removes readily.  If you have tried other waxes, you know what I mean.<br /><br />Will buy this product again from Amazon and same seller (assuming offered), without reservation.
B00KYWDP1A|5|I adore this palette and revealed 1 as well. Great pigmentation, blends smoothly, gorgeous rosy pink colors.
B00C4YJL96|3|worked somewhat.  would not buy again
B0028T2TD2|5|Good make-up brush!
B001FYV0HM|4|Nice product.  My daughter uses it and her hair looks great.  I like it, but wouldn't rush to purchase it again.
B00LBBHYLU|5|Works wonders
B00CLK2EA6|5|Nice fragrance and feel.  Purchased for sensual massages and it was perfect!
B001W2K51O|5|My hair twirls a little when it gets to about shoulder length. I stopped using any other chemicals in my hair but shampoo since abt 5yrs now. My hair isn't too thick or thin, I'm just about a normal blonde. This shampoo worked better than the original J.R. Ligget's.<br /><br />I was a little worried about this peppermint scent in my hair, but it isn't strong, and it doesn't bother me at all. My hair hasn't felt or looked better since I started with this shampoo, except when I was 5yrs old maybe, I don't use any conditioner or anything else, I just wash my hair 2-3 times a week.<br /><br />I feel a lot better using this shampoo as well because I don't have to throw out any plastic bottle when I'm done with it. Just wish it was available locally. Thanks!
B00IIFSH36|5|Super cool real looking tats. Made out of nylon so not for you big arm men. But good buy.
B00V8M05E0|2|These containers leaked out the bottom.  Disappointing.
B000VICKKO|1|I would never ever buy this I tem again because it doesnt work at all.  you will find more reviews of me because I bought more than 5 bottles but salty this shampoo  never work.
B007K6B4KC|3|I had an empty one of the same color and this was much, much darker which, I am guessing, is why it was on clearance.
B0001X0RDQ|5|great price on a superior product !
B0037HP9OA|3|Nicely designed body groomer, but I did not get the results I hoped for. The adjustable trimming end works well, however the shaving end takes many passes to remove the stubble in sensitive areas causing some irritation. Good battery life. Would recommend.
B004X49N6G|1|Product doesnt stay.  Had it in one day and by the next day it was gone i guess i  swallowed it. Would nt buy again
B000ZJVUR8|5|Arrived early and helped speed up the healing process very well.
B00HZ7XG34|5|this stuff is great, i am going to order the larger size!
B000VWSC1Q|5|I have never spent more than $14 on a beauty product but I have heard so much about this product that I had to give it a try. It is fantastic. I don't wear much in the way of make-up but this is very easy to apply and blend. It looks natural and not at all \\"glittery\\" as some reviews said. I think it looks shimmery in a dewy way. I am blonde, blue eyed and pretty pale and this looks very natural on me. Love it!
B008HDEX3M|5|This wig is great. I would recommed it to anyone. The hair has a great texture. I'm going to order another one like this. Plus it didn't take long to arrive either!
B00J42G2UW|5|I have been using the Arm & Hammer Truly Radiant Spinbrush and Toothpaste for a couple of months now! My teeth are whiter, shinier, stay smooth longer and my breath stays fresh all day long! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.
B001TQV0GC|5|Very nice<br />Great price arrived super fast
B003VMJ01Y|5|I love this stuff but selecting colors is difficult because they're not always true to what is displayed on the bottle (or on computer monitors).  This is a lush, dark fuchsia color that looks great on all complexions.  I've been getting compliments on it since I applied and I'm glad I made this selection.  If you like big, bold color, this is the one for you.
B000P22TIY|5|Very nice
B00IJZKCIS|5|great seller would buy again
B003SSTKHU|5|The moisturizing cream makes your skin soft, silky smooth and lasts all day.  Love all  Vivo products.  I am now hooked!  And will con't to order it here at Amazon
B004WOSTAS|4|I love this product it really gets rid of unwanted orange and greenish color tones in color treated hair.  Using the Qod Gold Keratin on color treated hair (especially ash tone) can leave hair &#34;brassy&#34;.  On natural ash blond or color treated gray hair, this shampoo is really amazing at making color last and bringing out rich gold highlights that we all want.  People have stopped me to ask where I get my hair colored.  QOD silver is professional quality and it leaves your hair silky and non-sticky.  It's amazing on color treated and natural hair.<br /><br />The reason I give it a four and not a five has to do with the fact that it can stain towels a bit.  It took a couple of washings to get the purple cast out of my towels, but if you can use a beauticians cape or use the product in the shower, it's great!
B00EJDDNQM|5|I have used this product for years and was glad to find it on Amazon.  It is a spray that allows you to tweek your hair until the spray actually drys.  It also brushes out easily
B003LUCACC|5|This is a great color for me - strawberry blond hair, fair somewhat freckled skin, blue eyes. I'm over 60 and don't wear bright or dark colors, so this soft and natural shade is great for me. Clinique is a good brand and it doesn't run into the lip lines and look scary like some lipsticks.
B00113HNB4|5|I purchased this recently, not here but at WMart, a little less expensive than here.  But what amazes me is that for years, I am 66, I have spent lots and lots of money on expensive facial moisturizers.  And was going through a period of trying out new ones since I was having a continuing problem with flaking on one side of my face and around my eye.  I tired Anew, for eyes, and liked it, but it didn't correct the flaking.  I tired Oil of Olay, I have tried  some stuff I bought on a cruise that cost me about $110. a jar.  And then I decided I needed a moisturizer for my legs, and when I saw this was good for your face also, I tried it on my problem area, well no one was more shocked than me that the next day the flaking was gone.  WT heck, this is for sensitive skin and non-comedogenic, and cost $11, a jar.  Never again will I bother with anything else.
B003YJOECE|5|I've been using this product regularly for over  6 years.  I have medium brown hair and use it to hide the gray.  I love it.  I only have to put it on about every 6 weeks.  My color choice is  B11W -Honey Brown.   I did use the &#34;warmer&#34; brown colors for a while, but when they began to rinse out, my hair took on a purplish cast, so do not choose the &#34;warm&#34; or &#34;reddish&#34; colors unless you want to rock a new color.   (I used to get a lot of compliments from younger women who liked my &#34;purplish&#34; hair.  haha)
B001MSP96Y|5|I love this makeup, have used it for years and they recently quit making the color I use so I ordered it here at amazon and it came quickly.
B000GCSCSE|5|best aftershave ever
B00008BFXL|5|as described
B005IMH9OA|1|This is a piece of crap-- Ace men's combs used to be made of a flexible rubber type material that would give to the bend of your butt when you sat down without breaking any of the teeth-- not any more-- they make of typical plastic and the darned thing is constantly breaking teeth.  Worse the teeth are so sharp that they actually snag your hair and scalp-- no smooth combing through your hair.  These are pieces of crap-- I'm not every buying them again!!
B0079R6BD2|5|I originally bought this for my son.  He raved about this shampoo so much I now use it myself.
B00D9SIIMC|5|I love these
B00KTLBEEQ|4|Curel's Rough Skin Rescue Lotion doesn't disappoint. This moisturizing lotion will ensure that your skin remains moisturized. I liked this particular brand, because the lotion didn't have a strong smell, and didn't irritate my skin (which is prone to eczema).
B007S02U94|5|I was nervous about trying a new scent, I now see why it is so expensive, the scent is heavenly!
B0006GZDE6|5|This is one of my favorite Aubrey Organics shampoos (which I follow with the matching cream rinse).  It says it's for oily hair, but I think it works with any type of hair.  I don't have particularly oily hair, and I usually use the moisturizing types, but this works great & leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  Other people I know with oily hair have great results with it as well.  It has a soft, fresh, pleasant scent, and you don't have to use very much (even with long hair).  I love it!!
B006UET4XE|5|The brush is stiff and very precise, as advertised. It's nice to be able to draw such a thin line direcy above my lash line. Produces flexible, inky liquid.
B000QYEK88|5|Best you can get.<br />All German...
B001KYOCI6|5|I love this product. It has a distinct citrus smell to it, which is awesome. It plumps my lips leaving them with a slight tingle but no burning or itching like some other products have been known to do. I HATE that they have discontinued this product at Maybelline! Thank God for Amazon!!!!
B000BTXXI6|5|bought this for my dad since its his favorite and was such a great buy since the price is pretty low.
B00KQSM982|5|Beyond excited that this belt arrived well before the estimated delivery date. I desperately needed the belt due to the extreme pelvic pain I have been having with my pregnancy. I am currently 28 weeks and it is unbearable. Like the other reviews state, this belt is great...it relieves the pain and allows to walk normal again!&#34; Also, I started physical therapy with a pelvic floor specialist and she also loved the belt. She said to wear it 23 hours a day to help keep the pelvis in place.
B00IXU8WK4|5|Love it
B00ECH7RTO|4|My husband love it
B00H3BROXU|3|I am a &#34;sand&#34; color. So I purchased this in the color sand after hearing great reviews. Product itself seems okay, but it had pink undertones which I cannot wear
B000C1W6TK|1|The product name on amazon says \\"Dreamer By Gianni Versace\\" not \\"THE Dreamer\\" which obviusly means it is NOT an original... didn't realized it until it had arrived and saw the packaging. I think that was misleading.. Wasn't able to notice that through my phone.<br />Money down the drain... Was really dissapointed to have gotten this.
B002QA31SU|5|These are for people with thick to thicker hair and they work really well.  Like all Scunci elastics, they don't tangle in the hair. Where they differ is that they will actually wrap around thick hair several times while the regular Scunci elastics will only wrap around thick hair once.  I love them, and I would recommend to anyone.
B004M7WKKK|3|Not bad. Not great coverage but for what you pay it's good.
B00PBJ055U|5|A very stylish case-looks like the picture. I received a lot of compliments
B0009OMU0A|4|I've enjoyed using this, however the battery does not last very long. Not the end of the world considering you can plug and shave.
B00MBR4FJ2|5|Perfect.
B003U8ESI4|5|UPDATE:  The comb is flexible so dont push it against your skin \\"to make sure you get an even trim\\" because it ill just cut it shorter than desired.  Also the comb is past the guard which can make you shave closer than desired if you slightly tilt it.  Now i have to shave my whole face because one side has a .5 mm trim and the other a 2mm trim.<br /><br />I liked the amount of hair it left on my face in the 1mm setting, and i like the feel of the hair a this setting. I did not use the turbo option; while trimming was not a problem the vacuum did let some hair fall into the sink. it wasnt much, and it seemed like the hair did not fall far from the sink so the mess was diminished.  Maybe if i used turbo it would not let the hair slip.<br /><br />The comb is a little rought, i remembered people complaining that they cut their lip so i was careful but still quite quick with it.  I didnt get cut but if i was carelless with it, it might happen.<br /><br />It good all my hairs even, except in the mustache area which it left them a little longer, but withing acceptable and understandable limits.
B00AU55L4K|5|I'm so happy the German Shop has the real Nivea for sale on Amazon! It's a little bit more expensive than your everyday drug store Nivea, but honestly the difference you feel in your skin is so worth it.
B00480KPD0|3|The product is fairly decent but does not seem as high of quality as my previous CHI hair straightener... this makes me worried that it could be an unautentic iron that looks very similar to real CHI products.  I have heard several stories of CHI knock-offs being sold so I'm truly hoping that mine is not one of them.
B00G4UC9SG|5|Great product!!
B00K6Z24SK|3|It was way to short of a handle. I wanted very much to like this razor due to the better grip but it was tiny!! I sent it back. Still using my trusty old Edwin Jagger.
B00BOUKXS4|5|love this product! makes me look put together but not overly done. i have black hair and the color is perfect match so my brows don't look too dark.
B00IEJT8V6|1|Only good if you don't mind removing all the hair and skin from under your arms.
B008VU2MQQ|5|I was on a small shopping spree for my grandson and so I purchased these.  Besides adorable, they're good quality for the price.  The suction cup feature is really a plus!  I'll definitely buy more when the time comes for new toothbrushes.
B000P20QPM|5|los felicitos<br /><br />me llego<br /><br />en poco tiempo<br /><br />los felicitos<br /><br />amigo<br /><br />jose coronado<br /><br />desde<br /><br />venezuela<br /><br />mas fino<br /><br />ok ...<br />.<br />.
B004F4PR6Y|5|Very good product! On time delivery!
B00CD2922A|5|Very handy to carry in your pocket or purse.  Easier to use than floss and probably just as good.  I love these things.
B007VXJK6O|5|I was going to buy the 4000 Oral-B but there were no more left on Amazon.  I was skeptical about needing the little timer but find it helpful. Sometime I do lose track of where I'm am in the cycle.  I find the different modes very useful.  The polishing mode has helped brighten my teeth more than special toothpastes.  I had less tartar on my teeth the last time I went in for a dental cleaning.  My gums have always given me problems and this check-up there has been an improvement as noted by the dental hygienist.  The toothbrush was pricey but with the rebate I felt it was worth it.  I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has gum problems and tartar buildup.
B00BH7HCME|4|it fits how i expected. I had some doubts but were dissipated. great frame.
B00HAG20UU|5|I'm using this kit to pierce my belly button today. Super fast shipping and everything is sterile and wrapped up! A+++++++ ! I definitely recommend this
B004Z9O8TG|3|I was actually looking for plates with alot of floral designs and I came across this one. I liked it, but i noticed there was alot of duplicates. I was debating, is it worth it is it not? It was either this one or the MASH set. But since at the time the MASH set was unavailable I chose this. I tested one out and some didnt come out as clear. The picture would'nt pick up. But I decided to just keep the set just to add to my collection. Just so you know. If you are willing to get this look at what your buying because it is showing you there are duplicates. So it's totally up to you if you think it's worth it or not. I mean some pictures pick up and some don't. I actually think it's okay. It's not the best just rememeber it's cheap so yea. I actually got a pic so you see how one turned out, and it came out beautiful. Also using regular polish.
B00EEK755U|5|moisture enough. keeps my hair smooth.
B00ARF42D4|3|Some electric trimmers are more versatile than this one, and can easily be used to trim head hair (or even pet hair). The settings on this one really are not as adjustable to broaden the purposes of this trimmer. The way the razors move and and plastic guard are specifically designed for faces and beard hair. So it works pretty well if you have no other plans for it outside of its intended use.
B008U5XS2O|2|Heats up fine. Snags your hair!
B00FHQF73W|5|My favorite oil perfume scent of all time. It last all day long and smells great!! I get lots of compliments. When the wind blows, I can smell the clean sexy scent in the air.
B009SE6DGO|5|This accessory is very good and practical for a gorgeous hairstyle in your hair. It's Beautiful! Loved it :) I recommend to everyone.
B003FITQGI|4|I purchased this in June 2012 so I'm not sure It's enough time to rate it but so far I have no complains or concrete remarks. It feels good on my face, make up goes on nicely over the cream.  Hope to see obvious changes in a couple more months.
B006J5YC68|2|not for oily skin
B003TTYH8U|5|My teen daughter swears this is the only face wash that keeps her acne-free. It was recommended to her by her cousin, who also fought complexion problems. Although we live in a big city, I can't find the product in any grocery or drug stores, so am glad that it is sold in the Amazon marketplace. But the shipping costs almost double the price of the item, which is unconscionable.
B0028K3J8K|4|I've used Olay's facial moisturizer (the original light pink version), for years, and have done so because it was my Mother's moisturizer of choice and she had fabulous skin.  I did see a small improvement with fine lines over the period of time I used it, but the amount of improvement just did not justify the cost for me. Still, I'd recommend it.
B005X2F7KI|2|These are really gloopy. That's not a real word but I bet you know exactly what I mean. I really like the colors but the quality of the polish is just not there, they thicken up as soon as you open them and get clumpy and hard to apply. Tiny dots become huge globs after your first use.
B00OHZF98C|2|The product was delivered really quickly! Unfortunately, I didn't care for it. I noticed no changes or benefits other than a slight tightening which disappeared once I put my moisturizer on over it. I am 48 years old, and have been looking for something to counteract or slow the signs of aging which seem to be more and more obvious daily! Lol I have no problem with the Yumi brand, I love the rosehip seed oil and vitamin c serum they carry. The Yumi representative I have spoken with and those I have emailed have been nothing but polite, patient, and very nice. I will definitely be purchasing other items from them.
B00JFSFDB4|5|These brushes arrived on time and beautifully wrapped. I was extremely pleased with the quality- they are a good weight with no shedding and they are incredibly soft. My makeup application looks beautiful using these brushes especially the eye shadow blending brushes. I am keeping these brushes on display because they look so nice! They  add glamour and sophistication to my vanity table. I couldn't be happier with this purchase! For more pictures and info check out my blog post:[...]
B0096P9830|1|This thing really freakin hurts! I got it for my face.... it rips the hairs out but takes forever as there are not enough tweezer things on it and you have to go over and over the area you are working on. It made my face all red and itchy and some of the hairs bled when they were ripped out. I would rather shave than use this thing ever again. Or use Nair or something instead.
B00850T4B8|4|It is exactly  what i wanted to get. The color was really dark brown and the length was perfect for me<br />Thank you
B006OR6CDC|5|I am very happy with this purchase! The price was right and it arrived quickly. I mixed about 28 drops of it with witch hazel and store it in the fridge, it works very well at keeping mosquitos away. I walked for 2 hours in the woods and didn't get one bite! I highly recommend this product for those looking for a natural remedy.
B0020MM8WO|1|I do believe this is a knock of version..  I smelt this product at a local macys and it smelt so much better.  Buyers beware, the deal is to good to be true.
B0086VIA0M|5|good.
B000H8YK74|2|I liked this until it made my acne-prone skin break out even more in places in normally don't get breakouts. If you have great skin (and light toned skin) the color looks very natural and you will like this. I will be returning it.
B008CT12G2|5|Good product!
B00FU2ASFK|3|Covers well, but tends to accentuate fine lines & is lighter than pictured.  I will keep it for use in winter when I am paler, & try diluting it with a little eye cream.
B00G9XOZ5S|5|Love this product!! Smells AMAZING?!
B00A78TEAM|5|I purchased this lotion after getting it in a sample packet with a variety of others as a gift. It smells much better than Splurge(which I really wanted because of the cute bottle) I ordered it on a Tuesday and received it that Thursday. The package was sealed and smelled the same as the package so I assume it's legit. I have used it four times in the past week, along with juicy tan extender, and I have to cut back on tanning because it has gotten me a little too dark for my preference. This is an awesome lotion and has shown great results!
B000VQZHKG|1|The cane ordered was not the size I asked for when it arrived. Would not recommend this seller.
B000H9E80W|5|I have had my two Purcell dispensers for 3 months now and I LOVE them. I ordered two and each dispenser came with two refills. They arrived as promised. And in perfect condition. I have one in the kitchen and one in the guest bathroom. With two refills still left over for replacement. They were very easy to install. They have a sticky tape backing and a screw wall mount section on back. I used both. I peeled the tape back, placed on the wall then used screws to secure to the wall. Both may not have been necessary but I figured I wasn't going to move it later so might as well secure it now. The refill bags were very easy to put in. Just feed the nozzle through the opening on the inside of  the machine like instructed and adjust bag inside square to close lid and your done. To help my kids to remember to use them I give out reward tickets if I \\"smell\\" that someone has used it without being reminded. Seems to be working like a charm. And using the name brand like this does work better than generic. Some generics really dry out the hands. Not these. These devices are pretty big and they are brownish in color like you see at offices or restrooms so not very attractive but to stay more germ free I will suffer with the eye sore. They are also not automatic so you do have to compress button with the palm of your hand to use. I opted for these instead of automatic because there were a lot of complaints of the automatics wasting batteries and going off all the time with just mere motion NEAR the machine. So said no thank you to the guaranteed mess waiting to happen. Not to mention waste of product. Hope this helped.
B004L18FY2|5|I have curly hair and have tried so many products.  I love the leave in conditioner, it controls my hair and accents the curls.
B000GCW4TC|1|This is by far the worst product I have ever used in my life (and I use a lot of products)! Not only did it not work, it actually had the OPPOSITE effect, my legs had such an adverse reaction to this product that I had to wear pants for days during the summer because the disgusting bumps and rash on my legs were so unsightly. I used this product as the directions suggested, felt a slight burning immediately after applying that I figured was normal, nothing too bad. A few hours later my legs were terribly itchy and red, and there were bumps all over that looked like bug bites. I had to use steroid cremes and cortizone for days before it went away. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product to anyone.
B0009EILAS|2|I don't like this product. It seems very hard to wash away. After I washed many times, my skin still seems too smoothy.
B0015BMGRI|4|Seems to work so far; have used it only for a short time. Did not know that a rinse  product should follow product use.
B000XTFP0I|5|This shampoo really does make my hIr appear thicker!
B000050FDV|4|I do not know about quality yet; but I hope it works well.The original I had, worked for 4 years(It was made in Germany).We have to see what will going on.
B00FAEOCP0|5|Best mascara !
B00CQCMQ70|5|If you are a Waterpic fan, you know these are not easy to find, at least here in Texas.  I am glad that Amazon carries these toothbrush heads and I for one really like my Waterpic toothbrush (so does my dentist) and very happy to have the consumables available via Amazon.com.
B00393010Y|4|It worked on my small spider veins, but did not work on the larger ones.  I am into my second tube and I am still hoping that some of the spider veins go away.  Looks like I have to go to a doctor for them.
B004BD107O|5|Best mascara I have tried. Catches even the smallest lash
B00AJLRHD8|5|Love this colour, works well for French. Good consistency and some nails only needed one coat on the tips.
B00BB8ZIQQ|5|I am happy with this set of heat rollers.  The velvet-like rollers don't pull my hair and the clips keep the rollers in the right place.  It heats up very quickly so I'm having to learn not to plug it in until I'm ready to use them.
B003RFA4QA|5|This is a fantastic product. It is light and fluffy and doesn't leave my face feeling sticky, which I hate. I have sensitive skin, so I need something light. This is absolutely perfect. I can't find it at Target anymore, so I'm so glad Amazon has it!
B004DPBPQ6|5|Like it a lot,the smell good,store don't sale it here
B007H3F5FI|2|Great sunscreen. But I spent a little extra for the spray top and it broke right away. Then it was realllly difficult to get the sunscreen out.
B000O2M070|4|It's harder than I expected to cover the gray hair. And it gets on my scalp easily. After getting it on, it looks pretty good.
B004DK0UDA|2|good for some design. but its not for sensitive design. it wont work well. I thought it would be easy to use.
B00373OK3A|4|I bought this blush brush because it was the only one in stock at the store where I was shopping at the time, and I didn't want to go somewhere else.  Considering that, I can't complain too much about the purchase.<br /><br />I tend to go pretty light with the blush; I have a pale complexion and it doesn't take a lot of color to have a noticeable effect.  Maybe it's just my technique, but this brush picks up more blush than I'd like.  I remedy that by scraping the brush across the edge of the blush compact before applying it.<br /><br />I typically just put a little blush on each cheekbone, so although the brush is somewhat small, it's just about the right size for what I want.  I've been using it for a couple of months now and none of the hairs have come out, so it appears to hold up over time.  One small problem I have is that I'm not really able to use this for blending.  What I usually just do is use the brush to put the blush on my face and then blend with my fingers.<br /><br />In the end, I'm sure there are better-quality blush brushes out there.  But, this one is not too expensive and it basically does the job I bought it to do.  I'd probably rate this 3.5 stars if half stars were allowed, but since they're not, I'll round up to 4.
B00JFLRDXW|1|It's great. It's not comparable to a sigma kabuki brush but it works great for the daily. I use it to apply bb cream everyday and it's perfect for it.  Ok so I had given this 5 stars... Definitely not 5 starts. It felt part a month later. The glue got soft and it's in the garbage now.
B000C210DC|5|Thank you.
B000H7Y250|5|Excellent product. Don't like smell too medicinal. Very good shave with no irritation.  2-3 drops is all that is needed.
B00NOFBPY8|2|Great to use when traveling.  The oil seems to stay on longer than the spray.
B001R2S8HM|5|I like it. Smell is going to be very subjective for everyone. For me, it was good. It feels very refreshing on my body. I would buy it again.
B00QPNV7HQ|5|This is such a well-made brush. The wood handle is easy to hold, and the brush goes smoothly through your hair. The special design is meant to cut down on dry time. Not sure if it really does, but I would definitely recommend this brush. It works well and the quality is excellent.
B0070A40FE|5|It's exactly as pictured and arrived perfect. So glad I ordered it and at such a great price too! Thank-You
B004K3D0FK|5|Best hair product ever! Gets rid of all knots in hair, leaves hair silky smooth and hair smelling so good.
B00LJDDK3G|5|Great deal! These brushes are awesome! Also love the blenders!
B00ILB5VUY|3|I like the kit and the package it came in. very useful and easy to make and use. however, my hair is only a light brown, and I left the bleach in for 45 mins (max time) and it only changed it to a honey color..... it was only a few shades lighter. this product is good if you are NOT looking for a major change, which I was this time. It also leaves a very bad smell in your hair, and it gave me a headache. the smell stayed through the next few days.
B003GLKPQ4|5|These are great, my mother- in -law is really happy with them.  Claims their the best product on the market
B004UQ6NP6|5|I bought it for my husband, he loves it so much.
B005EWF284|5|The  best
B001H9289Y|5|Love this product. One of the best concealers there are. Really good for sensitive skin like mine because it doesn't irritate like other concealers.
B000BH5IN6|5|Real smooth shaving. No irritation afterwards. Quick and painless. Easy to clean. Rechargeable and easy to travel with. Worth buying for the price it's being offered.
B00BBJQDT6|5|I love all of King of shaves products  Happy that they returned to the US  I missed them
B008TN1Z9U|5|highly recommend purchase
B0057HSL6G|5|I love this hair dryer. It generates good heat without burning my hair specially my hair is fine and not very thick, and it is fast too. it used to take me about an hour to straight and dry my hair lifting a heavy dryer. Now it takes me 40 minutes and it is fairly light. The only problem I have that the nozzle gets off easily between once in a while. I just hope this problem it would be fixed. It is a prefect hair dryer and worth the money was spent on it. it was shipped quickly too. thanks a lot!!
B00CD1QU80|5|Great shave every time
B00D3Q3X2U|4|Our friend Tony dresses up in drag and he likes them. Theyre a bit small but very good quality but you do need to put other padding in them. Made a great gift for him.<br /><br />I recommend this.
B000HLPKJ8|2|One of the two bottles, on both of the last two orders, contained very poor substance, and I should've complained to the supplier.  I think this product has been discontinued except online.
B004OYWQ5U|5|The best fragrance Clarins ever made - WHY WAS IT DISCONTINUED?????
B0000A10MZ|5|I formerly had the Waterpik WP-360W which stopped working after the first day on vacation.  I then bought the Panasonic EW1270 as a replacement based on the reviews I saw here.  After finally having the chance use it, I can say it worked like a champ during my two week vacation.  It takes a couple of tank fills for each use, but even so, after two weeks the lithium batteries were still good.  The stream is strong, and although not adjustable, I would still very highly recommend this product.
B000YJ2SKM|5|I used CeraVe products on the recommendation of my dermatologist and although I have not been a user for long, so far they are the best products I have ever used.  I have very, very dry skin and it is great.
B0035JEIEW|5|Smells great, very small bottle.
B00C0YJXVQ|5|Simply the best product for my belly!
B0023AV2XO|5|This stuff is great! I have lately been having problems with dry scalp from using so much dry shampoo since my hair tends to get oily pretty fast.  This stuff really cleans your hair and leaves it extra smooth and silky and bouncy with NO RESIDUE.  I think the people who were complaining about residue were just using it wrong, you really need to work this stuff into your hair to get it to lather.  Alos, they may not have been using enough product...  It's  a little extra work compared to what i usually do but so worth it.  Amazing results and this is coming from someone with oily hair who wants my shampoo to get it as clean as possible.
B00RFY3C2C|5|Love it!!! works well. but should be very careful. It's hot hot hot. I'd better buy gloves.
B000GREPOY|4|This is a very good quality Shea Butter.  My only downfall is that it's very grainy even after emulsifying it in my hands.  I actually had to completely melt the butter before whipping it as semi-liquid didn't get rid of the grainy feeling.  I never had to do such a thing with shea butters I've purchased in the past...from different vendors.
B00HNRFAGC|5|Rhis is an amazing product that you can use as a facial mask. Clears your skins and gives you a glow...just follow directions.
B008KEJ1LM|5|as good as advertised
B003N3DU76|1|sticky and thick hold.  Disappointing for Sebastian product
B001EWEP86|3|I realize that the term \\"unscented\\" does not always mean a product does not have an odor. However, I have found that when referring to deodorant, it usually does. (I have bought many deodorants that were called \\"unscented\\" and none of them had any noticible odors.) Not so in this case. I found that the \\"unscented\\" Mitchum gel has an odor that I find offensive. (A strong--and somewhat sweet--alcohol scent that does not abate sufficiently when the gel dries.) In spite of that, the product works very effectively at stopping wetness and body odor. I just wish it was truly unscented and not just un-perfumed.
B001KYOCTK|5|Its creamy and smells so good. People ask what I am wearing and that it smells so clean. I love it!
B004XADCA8|4|Nice
B005UKZAJG|5|This is a awesome gift idea.  you get a lot for your money.  My sister absolutely love this.  Worked perfect had no issues at all with order. arrived in time for her birthday!
B0010XUU9M|1|CAUSED LOTS OF ACNE!!!! worse product ever.
B00BB8ZHIU|5|excelente...
B00ATLN4VW|1|Wrong ad. I got fool by ad. Ordered 5 of them and guess what, it turn out 5 BBNY. I called Amazon CS. They said, they will re-order. And hopefully this will give us the correct one.
B000TD2PME|4|I have been using this cream for about a week.  I saw the Citrix brochure at the skin Dr's office so I thought I would give it a try. It's much cheaper on Amazon so I ordered it.  I was a little cautious about using it since I have sensitive skin.  I The first time I used it, it itched quite a bit.  I almost had to take it off.  I quit using it for a day then tried again with just a very small amount.  I did not feel as much itching the 2nd time.  I have  been using it once daily for about 5 days.  I guess its too early to tell whether it is going to make a difference on my skin. It  does go on nice and smooth and has no oily residual. However, even using a very small amount, I do have a few areas of my face that are more sensitive to the touch now. I may look into sending it back but I am not sure Amazon will allow me to since the reason is for an allergic reaction.  I am not sure that qualifies. I also bought the CRS Citrix serum but that has not come in yet.  The Citrix sunscreen is very nice. I had no problems with that.  Over all, I think for people like me, with sensitive skin, use caution.  The 10 percent L Ascorbic Acid is the lowest I could purchase.  Any higher concentration of L Ascorbic acid would definitely be out of the question for me since I am having problems with even this percentage.
B00EPQ6J28|5|Great products!
B00538TSMU|5|These are sturdy and fun!  You do have to cut them, of course, but they are awesome, especially for the price!
B0081QIL6A|5|This oil came in a glass bottle woith a pour top, so, recap tightly! The oil smells just great, with maybe a bit more orange than the original. I'm very satisfied.
B00L4FQVB2|5|I just finished a bottle of this. I have to say my hair has never felt better! My hair was dull and dry and no other product I've used worked but this did!
B00BYG7OD0|4|Thanks
B000TBVO9G|5|Fast shipping! and It does exactly what the description says. For now it's working fine on me in my first week of used.
B004T4PZ1W|3|Well,it sounded good, since the Dr. Oz gave it a good review. We are 0ver 1 month into the product ( purchased 2 bottles ) and have not seen any weight loss. We are very active and eat healthy so we were not looking but to loose a few pounds, anyway. In all fairness, we have had company for two weeks, and have not gained any either. My wife wanted to order another bottle, since the company has gone, and we are back to a sensible meal routine. We will see what happens.There are no side effects ( except, it does keep you \\" regular\\" ) . Also, we have not noticed any increased metabolic boost as the product boosts. It does curb the appetite, somewhat. Suppliments affect people differently. I probably was not a complete waste of money.
B00IQ21TK4|5|My skin feels fantastic after using this product.  It moisturizes without feeling greasy.  And I really like the fact that it the ingredients are mostly natural.  I am 60 years young and although no cream will return my skin to its 20 year young state, this cream makes my skin feel as though it has!
B004KQH9UE|4|These were much softer than the description. However it's a good deal for the money.
B00TWPGS14|5|The face becomes moist.<br />Scented good.<br />My face was beautiful.
B002S4JP5C|5|Delivered promptly. Good product.
B000P20S28|5|This is a product with many bias and variations. It is hard to say if you give it a 5-star or 1-star. My boy does give it a 1-star since he doesn't like the smell; however my friend gives it a 5-star because of the best smell she has ever experienced. The bottle design looks good to me. Buy it or not you better go to your nearby department store to give it a try. Since I buy this item for my friend thus I put a 5-star here for her.  Oh, it is from France but the shipping is quick. :-)
B002SJA3LC|5|I bought the unit years ago and it is my favorite shaver and was excited to see i could still get new heads.  Fits and works perfectly.
B00854JXVK|5|great product
B00120VWJ0|5|Finally a product I can use in the shower and not fear I'm getting cancer from it.  And it works!  Unfortunately I don't get the tingly feeling I've read about with this stuff, but whatever.  And I was hoping the minty smell would be even STRONGER (there's no such thing as too pepperminty if you ask me).  Again, whatever.  Also--I've read some people complain that this stuff doesn't lather very well.  Are you kidding me!?  Get a loofah and you'll get all the lather you could possibly want with this stuff!  It's like butta.
B009WI4A0C|1|Ok
B0070Z7KME|3|I thought this would smell better but after using it a few days, a bad chemical odor began to annoy me.  The rose smell got cloying too.  Did not seem to benefit from use either.
B001JB83EE|5|This product works perfectly, but is not so easy to use.  I found the shampoo, so I've switched to that, and I love it:)
B003USJVJ0|4|These are great for my daughters hair.  They are not as mini as I would have liked them to be, but they still<br />work well.
B007ISRFIM|5|This product is &#34;thinner&#34; than most, and I recommend it as a smoother and less of a shaper. I have crazy thick hair, so Im just looking to calm my hair down after the shower, with some light shaping. This does exactly that. It also remains somewhat pliable throughout the day. What it DOESNT do is make your hair crusty, or dry and flake white spots, which is awesome.
B0018P2ZEA|5|Awesome! It really helped my skin a lot!! Anyone wanting to try something that WORKS, use this! It really works.
B003WWMUW4|3|The glass is very thin. I'm afraid I'm going to break it.  Would have done better to look at some local stores for this buy.  I'm sure I could have found better quality for the same or, less.
B00VRN7SB8|4|The best thing about this Remington hair dryer for me is the speed at which it dries my hair. On the high setting, it blows strongly and gets the moisture out of my hair fast. I don’t like using the hottest of the three heat settings, but even on medium and low it works to dry my hair very efficiently. It also has a cool shot to help set my  hair once it’s dried.<br /><br />The weight of the dryer is adequate; it’s not the lightest I’ve used, but not too heavy to hold for the duration of the drying time. I prefer the control buttons to be on the side of the handle, because I sometimes will press them accidently with my fingers. I haven’t had that problem much with this dryer though. I wish the cord were a little longer so I could move around more, especially if someone is in the bathroom with me. The dryer is pink, which is lovely if you like that color. The dryer comes with a diffuser too, but I typically don’t use it. Overall, this dryer is working well for me and I’m happy to have it.
B000143C0K|5|I would recommend it to you guys also.<br />Thanks for the item.<br />It helps me shave with no problems at all
B00D42KZRO|5|Bought this as a gift for my sister, comes beautifully packaged, nice gold key as well......more importantly smells great and she loved it !!!
B004ZNFAQ2|4|I love that the mask heats up on my skin.  Cooking away the old skin & replacing with new skin.
B003JVVJZM|1|I got a fake one. It did even last 5 mins.
B0002F2I44|5|This is the best bronzing power there is. I have used it for years now.  It is not cheap, but it last a very long time and does not rub off
B00158N0VC|5|If you're one of those guys that wants to smell good but doesn't want to draw attention to yourself, this is the way to go. It's a very clean smell that people will notice, but not be overpowered by.
B00LV21TCY|5|Very good product
B000HKEYKA|5|As expected.  Love this color.
B001CJJ5NQ|5|Second-time purchase.  Expensive but seems to work.  Seems like a quality product.  Just wish it was cheaper.  Thank you very much.
B000HJT1CW|5|Bought this for my wedding and ended up adding it to my regular makeup routine. My skin sometimes get dry so it's really nice to have something I can spray on over my makeup to help moisturize my skin. It's also really great and keeping makeup from looking cakey or powdery and leaves my face with a nice glow.
B002GABCUE|5|Works great! I heard about cheaper knock offs but this was the real thing made in Germany. The whole shaver works like new again.
B006UET4XE|5|love it!! very precise!! I will order it again.
B000SC1IU6|5|I love these. They are similar to the tools  my foot doctor uses.Quality, sharp
B00JJB1P4Q|5|Good quality!
B00EZWTIDE|5|I had used this product before, but had difficulty finding it, so ordered through Amazon. It lives up to its description, is transportable and takes steps out if the process. So use it everyday and love it.
B005SWHA8U|5|I 've used this before, smell wonderful
B001E6VML0|5|Great sunscreen. Easy to apply and not sticky. Iit blended in well and protected us perfectly from the hot Florida sun.
B001CMV8FG|5|My wife and I both use this face wash, and love it. It works very well, leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, and is natural, vegan, and cruelty-free. It does have a bit of an odd smell, which some might find unpleasant, but it doesn't linger after you've washed it off.
B00777ZIEC|4|I love this brand of body wash but I did not like the smell of this one as much as I like the green bottle.  Definitely worth buying if you like body wash.
B007P29354|5|This was a very good value. I was surprised when it arrived I thought I have to end up throwing it out but I love these barrettes. The clasp is simple and it hold my hair perfectly. I'm very pleased.
B0045KF2KO|5|Great product. Took a little over a week to arrive.
B0016BACIM|5|I've tried lots of products, searching for those without parabens. I also have a LOT of gray hair that is actually more silver/white. Since I color my hair black, it's a challenge to find hair color that does the job and does not have those yucky parabens. This hair color is fantastic and I won't use any other! Heads up that if you go to bed with your hair wet, it will stain the pillow case, so use an older one, or a towel. But product doesn't wash out and lasts beyond each coloring. I have to color every 3 weeks and only because that white is showing. Great product!!!
B001G7PU4M|2|Not the same as store bought in many previous occasions.
B00AWKQWI2|5|Perfect!
B003NTR2YW|1|little tiny sparkles flaked off onto my face ....glittery dusty mess.  only good thing was the cheap price but not worth the hassle to drive to post office to return
B0000534X3|5|I absolutely could not and would not use ointment, too hard to apply.  Yes, this SEVERE gel works very well for me, the best product I have used so far.  Moderate to Severe does not work as well.  So be sure to get SEVERE.
B0076ZW0ZU|5|Great Variety of blades!
B001GQ3GEY|4|This item had alot of great reviews, so I decided to get it.  I was really impressed with the power.  It cuts close with plenty of power.  Doesn't take alot of time (few minutes) to recharge also.  I guess the only thing that is a bummer is that if you have a rough face or scars, it tends to dig into your face.  To fix that, make sure you lay it flat when trimming.  Besides that, it is great.  Oh, the only other thing is that it has a lot of attachments.  Don't think that I'll use all 17, but who knows.
B00BF2UFC0|4|I love the Neova Illuminating Eye Therapy, the only thing I would change would be the way that it is dispensed. After about half way thru the product the pump stops pumping the fluid out, but the copper in the product is great for the skin and I am definitely a believer! The product arrived as specified (I have used it before) and was on time- As I stated earlier my only issue is with the manufacturing of the product.
B0087QO1C2|5|Recd on time. Item as expected.
B0036BI56G|5|GREAT RESULTS
B000EGKA0K|5|I had been using this moisturizing for years and is the only cream that really moisture my dry-dehydrated skin. I had been trying many brands from the expensive, to the one that you can buy in pharmacies, but this is a good one.
B001E96OCO|3|I bought this product for both my husband and I. I have feet that peel and my husband suffers from sever cracked skin that eventually results in bleeding.<br /><br />My husband did not like the smell. I did not really notice a smell. My husband stopped using it as he said it was drying his feet out more than they were. I am still using it and my feet are peeling, they do not seem as dry however.<br /><br />I have previously used a Dr.Sholl (can't spell it) cream that was amazing but could not find it so I ordered this instead.<br /><br />I will finish out the bottles but do not think I will be purchasing again as I think I need to keep searching for something that was right for me. This is a shame as this product had so many positive reviews.
B00112HRTI|5|I couldn't find this in the stores but did on Amazon.  It's a color that I really like and didn't want to search for another lipstick of a matching color.
B00427C3X4|5|Love Hello Kitty.  This bag is durable and fashionable.  I use it as a supply bag for my backpack.  Works well.
B004PCRUJS|5|I don't have any other perfumes, but I do wear body sprays.<br /><br />I found a spray I REALLY like and at the time the bottles had samples of this perfume attached to it.<br /><br />I LOVED IT! I hated not having more of the samples!<br /><br />Finally, so long after I found the samples, I was able to purchase a bottle, and I wear it ALL the time!<br />I put it on my coat so I don't have to apply it every day to myself, and in my hair for special occasions!<br /><br />I am thrilled that it is not too expensive!
B001ET7KY0|1|I tried strand testing a number of times and it just tinted the grays
B001LUA5PI|1|Cheap, not well made product
B001BODO2A|4|I purchased this comb because I am growing out my perm however still wanted to wear my half wigs.  On the higher setting, the comb works very well for thick natural hair.  Well worth the price I got it for.
B0026S9OQK|5|perfect use for my dremel use for dog grooming to file dogs nails.
B011W865Z2|5|This is such a great alternative to a metal band. I bought this for my husband whose line of work it would be very easy to lose his finger if his wedding band ever got caught... so he has not worn a wedding band since we wed nearly 2 years ago. Once I saw this I was so happy to get it because my husband would be able to wear it to work. We got a size 10 and it fit perfectly. It is very light weight, and comfortable to wear. He doesnt even notice its there unless he looks at it. We got the brick red, and I think that it looks very nice on him. I got HonorGear Silicone wedding ring for free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. I would recommend this wedding band to anyone.
B004BAYYG6|1|I purchased this direct from the manufacturer and not from Amazon.  First of all I am medium-dark skin toned and neither of the sample colors matched my tone.  They were both too light.  The design of the dispensers is not well thought out and frequently spills when you're trying to apply the make up.    MOST IMPORTANTLY:  I feel this company exists solely to take money from consumers.  I purchased this through an online \\"Free trial!  You pay only shipping!\\"  The trial was $1 and shipping was supposedly about $10.  I figured it was worth it.  The fine print says you have 10 days to try your make up and return it if you're not satisfied.  If you do not cancel your \\"membership\\" you'll be charged $29.99/month for future shipments.  I called about 14 days in to cancel any further product.  I was not happy with the product but had decided to keep the trial set.  I just happened to check my bank statement just before calling the company only to discover I had been charged $130.41!!!  I was irate.  I'm not the type of person to yell at customer service people, but I went nuts on the csr and her manager.  The manager agreed to refund all but $39.99 (which is still a rip off for the crap I received.  I accepted and then called my bank to dispute the charges.  I also contacted the Better Business Bureau.    Within 2 days I received a response from the company saying they would refund the remaining $39.99.  Fine, but I still say it's a scam and this company should be avoided at all costs.  I am reviewing them everywhere I possibly can in hopes of shutting them down.
B002GKS6C6|2|The product worked fine for the first application, however the brush that you use to blend at the root area becomes worn immediately and does not blend nicely.....
B0014ZXXFO|5|great service. I really like this product it holds very well.
B004X1QKO2|5|I would recommend this product to people who don't like to use a foundation because it gives them more pimples and breakouts. It gives a little and almost invisible amount of coverage and I don't get any breakouts from it!
B001Q8XQVK|4|I love these hair combs. The only downside is the comb part starts to bend and doesn't work as well. So, it won't last forever.
B00S307EUI|2|The shadows don't stay on as long as I would have liked it to.
B00V5YFCXK|4|Good pack of brushes, fast shipping. Already had a few hairs/bristles shed during first use. Hopefully its just because they're new  & they'll work fine from now on.
B00HXBGIJ6|2|Very disappointed as my polypins were empty!  I ran over my hair, my hand and a cloth-nothing was in the brush.<br />An OK brush but I now put Aragon oil on my palm and run brush over and then use on my hair.
B003GDOSOC|1|Very bulky and hard to get on even with powder.  Would not buy another pair.  Need to be easier to put on.
B00132ZG3U|3|This hair dryer gets VERY hot but any extensions pop off very easily.
B00NIQMRD6|5|Awesome product, a smell that is so dainty
B00ITY6XK0|1|so far 3 weeks and it has not met my expectations disappointed with product
B0006M557K|1|I used this product twice per day as directed for 2 months, and noticed no change in my skin what so ever... except that it clogged my pores and caused my skin to break out.  Plus, it has a fishy smelling odor that is quite unpleasant.  Don't waste your time and money.
B000NWA1J0|5|I live in Vegas and it is dry.  These socks work!
B0089NNH1Y|1|I had to destroy all of these bottles after using <2 weeks. I was losing more hair using this product. I don't know if these are really true Kirkland or some fake products out there as they smell just like straight alcohol!!! BTW, I've been using Kirkland for years and I know what I'm talking about. Hope this helps!
B007IECL2G|5|I recently moved to NM which is a higher altitude than Im used to. I get really bad headaches. My masseuse uses this brand for headaches. Tried it once and it worked just like it did in her office. Ive had similar products from stores in the mall but never got the same results.
B000MASTMY|5|The proverbial trifecta for wrinkle development, but so far people still think I'm 30 not 42. I just moved to central TX, and worry more about aging skin here, the sun is the culprit. This product makes my skin smoother and more beautiful without irritation in the least, which for me, is saying something.
B00SWA9SQW|5|I use this to store my makeup brushes for work. I can see this also being handy for paint brushes, markers, pens, pencils...etc. Awesome price,lots of storage and compartments for a compact carrying case; so far so good as far as holding up to everyday use goes; I've only had it a couple months, either way at the price, it serves it's purpose for the value.
B000JNQSIQ|5|We had a pair of Wahl clippers which we have used for many years.  The blades were getting worn but we purchased this entire new set for a few dollars more than new blades.  It works great and has many different applications.
B002XY7HDE|5|If you think all nail clippers are equal, think again.  Try this MEHAZ 660 professional nail Clipper.<br />If you are looking for the BEST nail clipper, because you're tired of clipping your nails with dull, rusted clippers, try this MEHAZ 660 professional nail Clipper.  We've had this almost a year now and it has not rusted or become dull.  Would definitely recommend it.
B00VSH7LAG|5|This is a high quality jojoba oil and worth the price!
B00O8DBRKC|5|This stuff works great!
B001EJOPQG|5|I like it and am disappointed that they are not producing any more.
B005UBN5AQ|5|I've had so many different brush sets from Sephora. But never wanted to spend all the money in MAC for specific brushes. This professional brush set is PERFECT! Comes with every brush you need & then some. The picture is exactly what you get. Presentation for this product is fantastic. I use them every single day & it was the best buy I can say as a makeup artist
B00EOOT8AQ|1|ABSOLUTELY SILKY SMOOTH, really nice...unfortunately, i didn't even smell a hint of vanilla...its a &#34; clean - soapy scent&#34;<br /><br />i dont require a lot in the &#34; odor department&#34; and i got zero protection.<br /><br />i even applied it twice...even a third time!<br /><br />EVERYBODY has different chemistry/ pH levels...and i'd read really positive reviews...<br /><br />you can ALWAYZ try for yourself....perhaps its my pH...hope you have better luck than me...<br /><br />the LAVANILLA perfumes are amazing!
B003WR3QSG|5|Love this Badger shaving brush. There were a few hairs that fell out with first few uses but that's to be expected.<br />This brush is vastly superior to the boars hair brush it replaced.<br />And the price is great too!
B00CBYC45C|1|I don't thing is the the same cream I use to buy! UIs  something wrong with it!
B0011021MS|5|The right item at the right price. Love it!
B00RGQ33XM|5|Nice hair.  I flat iron it and its so beautiful.  The hair is soft and look so natural
B000XE6336|5|This has been a favorite fragrance of mine for years..I love it!
B0046KFZC8|5|worked great for maintaining white hair. it felt like the shampoo was all you needed
B00NN4ZX2A|3|Haven't noticed any difference but use it daily.
B003LQZTV0|5|smells really good and hydrates without being greasy
B000ALIL78|5|Bought this for my grandma becuase she worships the stuff. She was so excited to get more as she has had trouble finding it. She says it works great for her thin skin.
B0036WD0GA|3|I don't know what happen to my order. It's been almost a month and I never got the splash I ordered from you. Fortunately Amazon did not charge me for the item that in the end, I never got from you guys. I never got an explanation as to why I did not get it.
B00BQ76XK2|2|i thought that i would buy this product as a alternative to the beauty blender which is expensive and I'm sorry top say that this disappointed me,  i even tried to wet it to see if it would apply easier and that didnt help much. i guess what did  expect for the price right (shruggs). its just too dense and it doesnt blend makeup well. sorry...  the colors are true to picture .
B005F11QO8|2|I shave with straight razors on a daily basis. The only problem I had with this is that it doesn't hold an edge. I shave with it once and it needs to be sharpened again. Not stropped. Not honed. Sharpened. It's ridiculous how quickly and easily it dulls. It looks beautiful, though. If you're looking for a good price on a straight razor, get a Chinese gold dollar. Or buy this, keep the handle and replace the blade with that of a gold dollar. Such a shame. Disappointed. It's absolutely beautiful though. If you're looking for a decoration, this is for you. I wouldn't even recommend this to a beginner, let alone a proffessional.
B0013ND45G|5|She loved it.  I guess she had used this in the past and I guess it's hard to find now.  Since it was a purchase for someone else and she likes it, that's my review.
B004TD23W2|4|Excellent quality, great price, speedy shipping and works well.
B0036LMFYO|5|this is a great price for the amount of soap u get. Have bought in the past at an open air market for same amount of soap for much greater cost
B009GA5XVG|4|Does a really  good job with the hairs it does reach.  I'd like it to reach a little further into the nose though.  Still had to trim some of the inner hairs not near the nostrils.  I recommend this product for anyone who hates dealing with nose hairs every few days.
B008SBIXOI|2|The spray has it's own scent.  Since it is unable to eliminate all original shoe odor, the mixture of two smells make it even worst....
B00912CL5K|4|not my taste but it came in good condition and my mom likes it so it was worth the purchase
B007BFIK2W|4|havn't use all, it's ok, but nothing special.
B008P0S02M|2|Unfortunately I am heading off back to grad school, so I thought I would cut corners and try to find a facial moisturizer that would be less pricey that the normal stuff I purchase.  This however, did not do my skin any good.  I usually have typically clear skin, however with 3 days of usage it brought me back to my middle-school acne days and caused deep, cystic acne.  I will perhaps use this as a body lotion, but it will not be coming anywhere near my face.  Disappointed in this product.
B009BNLAWO|1|returned
B00CJ01QT8|1|I bought this after reading the good reviews. After about 4 weeks of using this product I truly feel it did nothing for me.
B00KMXQZC2|4|This stuff is more than a stretch mark cream. it's healing even for hands and all scars. I keep it to cure dryness. If you want to quench your skin. This cream does that and them some.
B00I92N6S4|5|I fell in love with this mirror when staying at The Brice Hotel in Savannah. So much in fact that I went online and ordered one for my bathroom back home. It was waiting for me when I got back from Vacation. I love it! Swivels great, magnification is awesome. Perfect in my book!
B001F0QXNM|5|Great gift ideal.
B001LBS446|5|Buxom is one of the best lip glosses ever. It does exactly what it says. Makes lips feel and look plumper, and has a tingle that feels great. I have several colors...prefer nudes and pinks. It lasts a long time in the tube and stays on the lips fairly well, as long as you don't eat or drink too much. When I wear this, I don't feel like my lips walk in the room before I do. I am over 50, a real customer, not a paid endorser.
B004BQ6KR6|5|My skin was noticeably more hydrated (which I was expecting) and brighter (which I wasn't expecting) after using this.
B000A409J8|5|I like the product,the price is great, and so was the fast service. Will recommend you to others. good job.
B0020MM6US|5|Badgley Mischka is the greatest. I love it. I received it in just a few days after purchase. Thank u
B001A3HPT0|5|This is a cheap set.  Plain and simple.  But it's usable.<br /><br />Wet shaving is cheap on the long run, but like buying anything in life, you have to put some money down first.<br /><br />This is the perfect set for you to see if wet shaving works for you.  You can get this at a CVS/Wal-mart cheap, under $10 dollars.  The more expensive items will not be leagues above this, so if this is \\"unbearable\\", don't bother wasting your money buying the better stuff.<br /><br />Now on the flip side, this should not be your long term set.  It's good for a few months, but if you're gonna continue wet shaving, invest in better.<br /><br />The Brush:<br />- This set:  It's fine, it's a plastic handle with some hair on it.  It gets the job done, just don't expect a \\"facial\\"<br />- Expensive sets:  Search silver-tip brush.  Don't expect magic, it will just feel softer.  It holds more water so supposedly is better for lathering.  Should cost you 60-120 dollars.<br /><br />The Bowl:<br />- This set:  Cheap ceramic bowl.  It's a bowl...<br />- Expensive sets:  There's the mug version, and the bowl.  Then ceramic or Chrome.  No point other than aesthetics, I like my things looking the same.  Clearly you don't need to buy a new bowl.<br /><br />The Soap:<br />- This set:  Its an aloe soap, this set is meant to be universal, so its a gentle hypoallergenic soap.  It's alright, some people with sensitive skin love it.<br />- Expensive sets: Proraso cream or soap is the best.  Some people like some brands out there, but that one is the generally considered best.  It's cheap, unless you absolutely love the other soap, there's no reason why not to upgrade.  A tube of the proraso is like $5, and will last you months or like an year or more... So even if it glides a fraction better, why not?  There's a mutton fat soap for the tradition fanatics.<br /><br />The Razor/Blade:<br />- Buy Merkur, should be $30 dollars or under $50.  Try for long handle version first, it will be closest to what you're used to.<br />- Blade is \\"feather\\" blade.  It's the sharpest, which is also the most unforgiving.  Yeah everyone has a \\"favorite\\" brand, but this is noones least favorite that I know of.  Or buy a variety pack and try out different ones till you like one.<br /><br />So in General, an expensive set should cost you:<br /><br />Mug: N/A use anything<br />Soap: $5<br />Brush: $70<br /><br />So about $90 with shipping.<br /><br />If it's something you'll use for years to come (after trying out this pack to see if you will), even it it's a tiny fraction better, why not?  Why are some people here acting like $100 means life or death?...<br /><br />Where you'll save in wet shaving is the blades.  The general consensus for a good shave is each blade lasts you 3 shaves, or 3 days.  A pack of 100 is about $22 dollars, about.  So that's 300 days, or close to 10 months for $22 dollars.  $22 dollars wont even buy you a Gillette fusion refill these days where I live... And let's be honest, we usually take such bad care of it that those blades last like a week or two.  At least with this you can just throw away the blade.<br /><br />Someone said \\"blah blah to use to scrape hair off your chin\\"...  If only it was that simple, as most of us men know, shaving is an every day thing, a part of our lives.  If you're going to do something EVERY... SINGLE... DAY... and you've used this box to see if you like this method, why not spend $60 dollars for a brush even if it is a tiny little bit better, and $5 for a soap that will last you 5months to a year... The $5 dollars is worth just the fun of trying out a new thing...<br /><br />Just DON'T expect this magical thing with the expensive versions, and if you're on a tight budget, this will hold you through for a while!<br /><br />EXTRA:  If you find a way to hold the brush upside down (the proper way), the water will seep down and extend the life and use of the brush.  Water running into handle ruins it faster.
B002N5MHLU|5|I recently converted from using a hand razor and it took a 'little while to get used to using an electric razor but now I'm getting closer shaves and halving the time spent shaving. Highly recommend this Razor.
B0079R6BD2|5|Good item and good buy.
B0097G3XDY|4|It works! Lost my lashes after chemo and they never came back. It's never going to be perfect anymore but thanks to this stuff I do have lashes again
B008M7Z84Q|4|Liked the quality
B00196UB1M|5|This arrived at the expected delivery date.  Packaged and well sealed. Vitamin c serum clear..good sign of freshness.  I find these products work just as well as the skinceuticals brand
B00867C9VC|5|OH.... MY.... GOD.....<br />This has to be the best smelling concoction I have ever put on my skin. The box was behind the door and I swear, it already smelled nice! I was actually afraid that some had leaked out or the packaging was broken, but now... it is just that aromatic. I opened it and my daughters came running in asking what smelled so nice. I immediately decided to try it and I took a shower, putting the scrub all over. Instantly my bathroom was transformed into a spa experience where I was the pampered Goddess! Seriously. I am so in love with this product I am ready to shout it from the rooftops. Send me this for my birthday, for Christmas and for Mother's Day. I want to move to the orient and swim in this opulence if this is what it feels and smells like... Heaven on earth. Really!
B000052YM7|1|too strong
B002JAYMEE|5|I am akin to Snow White in my ultra-paleness, and I spend a lot of time outside on stroller walks, so something finally clicked for me, and I decided to get serious about sunscreen. I am so happy with this one! The whole reason why I never wore sunscreen in my day-to-day life was that it's always so oily and greasy and smelly and streaky. Even when the label says that it's not greasy and blends right in. Guess what? THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY NOT GREASY AND BLENDS RIGHT IN! And, as a bonus for my Southern skin, it actually smells like honeysuckle. Honeysuckle! I love that it's a very high SPF (I use the 100+) and it does not leave stains or marks when it inevitably gets on my clothes (toddler wrangling leads to less than perfect precision). Now I wear this sunscreen each and every day, and I sincerely hope that it will help me to stay around for my son for a very very long time.
B00112AJV6|4|This is a really nice foundation.  It blends well with my skin and covers my imperfections pretty nicely. Only problem is it makes my already oily skin even oilyer .
B00M9IG744|5|I was really amazed the first time I used this brush. I've always stuck to wide bristle brushes because I have wavy hair. However, now that I have short hair this is the perfect solution to taming my hair.<br /><br />It feels like a massage as it goes through your hair. The curvature of the brush fits it against your head and you're able to brush about 1/3 of your hair with a single stroke. It leaves me hair feeling softer and less frizzy.<br /><br />The brush is a lot bigger than I anticipated but it covers more hair in a single stroke. Highly recommended.
B000G0GW6K|3|long hair trimmer does not &#34;pop up&#34; easily and actually popped out on one occasion. doesn't feel like a well made product.
B0001MROQA|4|This is a replacement curling iron, when they finally wear out, I always buy it again.  Great curling iron.
B00JI5JEV4|3|These work and the price is great but the hair of the brush fall out all the time.
