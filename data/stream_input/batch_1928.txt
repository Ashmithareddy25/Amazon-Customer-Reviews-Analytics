B000VYX8PE|5.0|I love this book instead of ending in a very happy ending and stopping itstead will keep on going READ IT NOW!!!!!
B009CGDERO|5.0|Nathan Fillion and the rest of the Serenity cast pull off a truly wonderful film centered around the characters of the one season firefly series.  But you don't need to be familiar with that series to enjoy this movie.  Witty and moving, this is one of those movies that would make you want to see more from this director even if you had never heard of The Avengers.
B00914JWSW|5.0|this was a gift... she requested... so i'm sure she'll enjoy it... a long time fan of Barbara...  She has most of her cds...
B008IGP8LY|5.0|I bought this simply to have it in a vinyl release.  I probably won't open it even though I have the ability to listen to it.  I bought the CD and this to have just so it wouldn't be fair to review the quality of the actual pressing.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is awesome I just got it and I can play it with my brothers and friends and still level up online
B004SBQGHS|2.0|This game is great!!! It is fun and occupies many people of all ages!!! It gets your mind off of any stress you have!!

B00ARAN9JW|5.0|Resident Evil: Retribution [HD] my son and I really enjoyed the movie 1st of the series we have watched and we will watch them all.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|One of the best books I have read in a while. It seems very real.katnis is so mentally and physically strong yet emotionally clueless and the tension is painful. Love it! I hope the next book helps me understand their world better.
B008UZ7MUI|4.0|Love this movie, the 3D version is a little hard to get used to when viewing at home. Otherwise, very pleased overall.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works great.  Have had no problem in using this product.<br />Would recommend to others.  Not much more to say about a cable wire.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|An adult version of twilight or Harry potter. Intriguing story line and wonderfully inviting to every sense in the body
B00821OW8K|4.0|I agree with several of the reviews that the start of the first season was kind of dull, but it did pick-up towards the end. I just finished watching Season 2 and WOW! What a great ending to the season and I can't wait to see season 3!<br /><br />If you're a die hard sci-fi lover, you'll love this how but even the casual watcher like my wife has been enthralled with it. Push through season 1 and look for the fireworks in season 2!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This was a good movie and lots of fun to watch. A wonderful movie for a weekend evening when relaxing.
1936594234|2.0|This book was suggested by my counselor.  I found offense in the very first chapter when the Author stated that all the knowledge in the universe is contained in your subconscious mind.  Get real!
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I have owned several of these across a variety of devices. I started using them with my Kindle 2nd Gen, later om the iPad 2 and most recently this one for my Kindle Paperwhite. They hold up well and offer nice protection. I have always been happy with my Timbuk2 Ballistic Envelopes.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is highly addictive.<br />I can hardly stop playing it!!!!!<br />I love it and glad I got it.  Highly recommend it<br />PS - don't need 17 words to say how much I liked it.
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|lots of action and interesting story line<br />kind of suspensive the acting not bad either<br />good camera work on seeing how it must be<br />to ride in the big cities
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We had not watched the shows during the seasons, but the recipients had watched some and wanted this so they could catch up and review the show before the new season. This gift was perfect, and Amazon's price was unbeatable.
B008476HBM|4.0|Pride and prejudice is a romantic story that shows how two people fall in love through pride as as well as prejudice.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Myh wife and I sync or calendars to keep up with who needs to be where and when. Especially handy to doctor appointments and birth days. I put this app on my Kindla Fire and sync with both of our cell phones and computers.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|awful movie absolutely the worst. wish I could get my money back.<br />terrible how is this for a review? sucks
B002PZC8BM|5.0|The Mentalist is a great show.  Also, it is amazing that I can buy individual episodes totally hassle free.  They couldn't have made it easier.  Just one more reason why I love shopping with Amazon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was very well written. It flowed well and kept you wondering what was next. I found myself thinking, ok, it is pretty, good, but did not have high expectations. Boy,  was I wrong. The more I read, the better the story got. Great unexpected twists and turns. I was spellbound. I would never have expected the ending. A great read.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Riveting well paced and suspenseful. Although i THOUGHT I knew how things were going to go I was wrong several times and the twist at the end though umexpected was in retrospect hinted at from the start and followed logically.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|A good enjoyable book, not Grisham's best, ( his best I rate 5 stars )<br /> but still a worthwhile read if you are a Grisham fan.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book like the others has kept my interest from page one til the last. When the second movie of the Hunger Games is out in theaters I for sure will be there to see it. THANKS FOR WRITING SUCH A GREAT STORY.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Great ebook edition! Downloaded very fast and my son was able to read it right away. He is 7 and loves it!
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|Great book for starters really funny I won't tell you the whole book ROALD DHAL does it again another FANTASTIC book
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Nice &#34;twist&#34; near the end. Bale as Batman seemed lethargic throughout the entire movie; Gordon-Levitt's performance & character was much stronger.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is my new favorite. I have told the entire family about this book and they bought it for their kindle. Women might think this is more of a male story but so not true.
030758836X|5.0|Started slow and was wondering why such a seller and then I got into it.  All the twists and turns makes it a must read!
B009AZZEU2|4.0|What ever happened to rock like it used to be? This CD is good, not the best CD by Soundgarden, but is still good! A lot of the songs sound very similar.
0307956350|5.0|I chose this book for my book club and we all enjoyed it.  I can see this one made into a movie for the big screen.  Exciting and takes twists and turns that surprise you.
B005WQ4GHA|5.0|Nice people good product i buy moré moré moré from this people any time i like The product very good
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again Nicholas Sparks takes you away into the world of true love. Anything and everything seems possible. Safe Haven tells of a woman`s struggle to come to grips with an abusive husband and the courage to leave and start again and to believe in true love. Thank you Mr. Sparks.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I ordered this CD after listening to the samples on Amazon. I don't think the hit &#34;Sail&#34; is very good but the other songs are awesome! The songs are definitely different from what I'm used to but I love the sound and beats. This CD is really cool, great listening and I can't wait to download on my Ipod and go snowmobiling, I'll be thrash'n!
B009E3EY4M|4.0|Great show by Zeppelin.  Been waiting 5 years for this and wasn't disappointed in the least.  Well shot and good audio quality.
071815780X|5.0|Having some 600 cookery books on my shelves I had promised myself I had reached 'an elegant sufficiency'.  But Jamie's 15 minute meals arrived on Australia's TV and I was taken by the first episode.  I had almost all of his books and most often used his 30 minute meals.  This is Jamie at his mature best writing for the everyday, for Mum and Dad in a hurry but wanting an interesting, healthy meal.  The book is clearly set out and logical, the recipes are easy and fun!  You are even told what pans/saucepans etc to have ready at what temperature.  One of the joys has been that many of the ingredients are interchangeable once you get used to handling the book: no late rushes to the supermarket.  For whom do I advise this: all of us - we have to eat, and one can easily cook half the recipe, or, I daresay, double it!
B009C7JS14|5.0|this app will be the only app I use for weather<br />the reasons I will be only useing this app is it is very simple to read and very nice to look at.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Watching this in 3D is awesome. Everything is just more alive. Once you see movies in the 3D mode I don't believe you will want to watch them regular again.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great inspiring book, a real eye opener. I hope the movie lives up to the book a must read for anyone.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I loved this book because it was a beautiful little story. But what really amazed me was the fact that while it was beautiful it was real. In most books things happen that probably wouldn't have happened in real life. The things that happened could have happened in the life of a normal girl.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|I just saw this movie for the first time. I thought it was just OK. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. It's definitely not a movie that I ever foresee myself watching again. The definition of 3 stars.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie because it made me open my eyes to the reality of what happened 1000s of years ago in the life of Jesus Christ.  It shows some of the tenderness of his relationship with his mother Mary. It also gives you a taste of how he died and what he went thru to save us.  If you believe in God and that He gave His only begotten son for you, this is a definite must see.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|i love this book . I'm an advanced reader and this is the book i want to read over and over again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi I'm I choose cause it's addicting and fun but you should add the new York one to kindle fire and have a cheat code book
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the game has decent graphics that everypony should enjoy ... wait what did I just say 0-0 nooooooooooo ive ive turned into a brony a well ... fluttershy is best pony.  :)
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|This is an awesome movie that lets you look into how things were in the past concerning love and relationships.  It shows a darker side that many ppl dont know about when it comes to royalty.  I would recommend to those who love a good drama
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Its a mind game and i like that... WORKS THE MIND!!! it will keep you on your toes at all times....
B005LAIIA8|5.0|There are already nearly 30 reviews of the film here on Amazon but this will be the FIRST one for the DVD and BD version. A few folks asked about whether the original 30-minute \\"live action\\" film version will be on the DVD.  Let me state up front that YES it is on both the 2-Disc Blu-ray combo pack and the 4-Disc Combo pack (which is exactly the same as the 2--Disc one except it adds a 3D BD - you need a 3D TV and player to use this - an a digital copy)! This is a wonderful bonus because it's never been on DVD format before (and for some - like me - it was something completely new.)<br /><br />Before I provide some more details, I'll state that I've not seen very many Tim Burton films so I came at this one different than those already big Burton fans. I did enjoy it a lot and I'm not a fan of horror films (I love Mel Brooks but \\"Young Frankenstein\\" is one of the few Brooks films I don't care for.) Now on to the info you can use.....<br />At times this film looks like it is CGI animated but it is actually a stop-motion film done with puppets. While the first 20 minutes - maybe even 40 - are \\"cute\\" and might appeal to all ages - the original death of Sparky - no spoilers here, you know he is going to die so he can be brought back to life - is even done \\"off screen\\". But then things get , well, I'll say, creepy. And very young children might get scared. Let's just say that if they are old enough to be able to watch the original \\"Frankenstein\\" they'll be fine with this.  But I'm not a parent, so I'm only giving guidance here.<br />The score by Danny Elfman - who does nearly all of Burton's films - provides most of the soundtrack. There are quite a few scenes with no dialogue; the animals (dogs and cats) don't talk like they do in Disney films. The film is in \\"black and white\\" but I'd define it better as \\"grayscale\\" and the images on my MUCH older TV were crisp and sharp on the BD.<br /><br />Now to the bonuses - of which there are five:<br />First comes an \\"original short\\" ( 2 ½ minutes) titled \\"Captain Spraky vs the Flying Saucers\\".  Cute but virtually a throwaway<br />Next is \\"Miniatures in Motion\\" - a really interesting \\"making of\\" featurette that runs 23 minutes.<br /><br />Next comes a 4 ½ minute featurette on the touring exhibit of Art from Tim Burton films. Okay but more of a promo<br /><br />The other great bonus comes next. The aforementioned original FILM version of \\"Frankenweenie\\" directed by Burton and starring Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern. It runs 30 minutes and is great to see after the stop-motion 80 minute film.<br />Last comes the \\"music video\\" of the song \\"Pet Sematary\\" by the band Plain White T's. Okay only cause it's there.<br /><br />Well there you have it. If you saw the film in the theaters and really liked it, you'll find the \\"making of\\" and \\"orifinal film\\" nice bonus features. If you haven't seen the film, these bonuses will add to your understanding and enjoyment of the film. It did mine.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"rt\\" ( 2 ½ minutes) titled \\"Captain Spraky vs the Flying Saucers\\".

B000DWMN2S|5.0|This movie is one of the few that I've found both hilarious and tragic. At times I laughed until I cried, and at times I just cried. I've seen this one several times, which is reare for me.
B00008G7UJ|4.0|i enjoyed this movie when i was young because i loved leonardo.  but seeing it this time, I got lost a few times because of the dialect they used.  Its a good movie that puts a modern spin on an old classic love story.  however, it can be hard to keep up for those who are unfamiliar with the story or shakespeare.  but the movie did show very well
B00A757EFW|5.0|i choose this rating because its a lot of fun i liked everything but i wish it was a little faster....
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Well, considering I thought this was a British comedy (it isn't), it was a little disappointing.  But, the acting is good and it has its moments.  Still, I think it's overrated.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm not a reader but when I kept hearing about the Fifty Shades Trilogy I got intrigued! Needless to say after the first book I was hooked!!! Loved loved loved it!!!!
B007T8BYWE|5.0|This one isn't the only one we have purchased. Worth the price, keeps interest going.  Will get more as they come from FlipPix.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought that considering what the book was about it was very well written and I liked it a lot, can't wait to read the rest.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love this series!  So much drama.  I'd watch Maggie Smith in anything.  Can't wait to catch up in order to start Season 3.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|gave this as a gift for Christmas and now the giftee is ready for season 3 while yet another family member, who lives in England and has already seen season 3 has been caught up on what took place before that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its a fun and easy game to play all u do is avoid objects and u can go against other players
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Fast paced.... Good read....Stephen king does it again...makes you feel as though you were walking right along with them the whole way.
B00846REIS|4.0|Intriguing and eroticly delicious. Very similar to fifty shades of grey, with sparks of new appeal. A good read. Love it.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|Given as a gift and they loved it. However, they had to purchase a blue ray - guess I didn't read the fine print :-)
B009CGYO0K|2.0|It was somewhat funny. But it was a good book for children to read or someone who is really into cats.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love it. It's so much fun! I'm addicted to it! Sometimes I'll play for hours at a time.<br /><br />I love the graphics and the plants.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have always loved the Pendergast novels and look forward to more.  The book starts out with some good action followed up by some tragedy but then moves on into good detective work and two different story lines with action packed endings.  It's a must read for any Preston & Child fan.  Oh, and yes, there are Nazi's in this book.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|this game was great I recommend  it these are the kind of games I enjoy playing with suspense and mystery.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I can't think of any reason to fault this series.  This is suspenseful viewing at its highest level.  The layering of plots cleverly staged while remaining simplistic.  Truly enjoyable American crime drama.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like the ease of moving the cards from one space to another.  Better than in other versions of this game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't think she could top her \\"Slammed\\" and \\"Point of Retreat\\" novels, but I was wrong.  This book is stunning, and it stays with you long after you've read it.  It is a must read!
B003Y74KAW|5.0|The case is grippy and fits my iPhone 4S (Verizon) quite nicely. I really like the design on the back (the raised rubber pattern looks like rings made by a droplet of water). However the sides are not as tight as I'd like. Other than that, in comparison with other \\"grippy\\" cases this one is the best/grippiest that I've tried (better than the rubberized hard case ones). It's a great case, and not very expensive either!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I bought this one for the fact that it has both black & white and colorized. I expect it this week. The excellence of the movie was not in question. This is a classic for the ages. The casting is superb, the story is heart-warming, the acting is engaging. See it if you haven't. Not the remake, though (doesn't hold a candle).
B005K17RU0|1.0|I wanted to use this as my weather app, but it loops for a long time at launch, attempting to find my current location then doesn't even choose the only location that was chosen in setting.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I use the free version and anything i need to copy for school I can take a photograph and print it out. I've also done this with old pictures and it was so much quicker than getting the scanner out.
0972169504|5.0|Jorge Cham has really captured the essence of the graduate student and his/her graduate school experience. Every grad student should read his series of comic books; it'll help alleviate the hardship and isolation of their grad school experience!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|By far the BEST show on television! Its a must see! Evan peters was enough to make me watch it! <3
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter, fell in love with this game immediately (come on, it has cute animals!)  She spent hours playing the game, and became quite adept at playing.  I'll keep an eye out for the other Panda games.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|The latest Pendergast story.<br /><br />As usual, all the essential ingredients are there. What more do we need?<br /><br />A super yarn, well told and well written.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|In the third and final book the author once again creates a great story line with increasing suspense. Setting the pace to keep the reader frantically turning the pages to find out how it ends. I would definitely recommend the final book in the trilogy. It sums up the story nicely.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Buy it, You'll like it. Great beats, Great Mix of tracks, has lots of philosophical lyrics mixed with thought provoking insights.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Wow, I love the idea of drawing your own quest!  It's a bit tedious to draw and change items in the game, but having the player draw their own items takes use of the touch screen in Android.  I love it!
B008NW67E0|4.0|If you like folk music you owe it to yourself to give them a try. I am certainly going to get more of their albums when possible.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Product not properly mixed for sound or picture, for example; home theater setting with a set sound level - during action scenes the sound is deafening while on dialogue scenes sound is too low to discern dialogue. For picture - the size shifts many times from full screen to wide screen with the black bars displayed. Most annoying. This is a replacement as the first DVD had the same problems. Poor editing and mixing. Not recommended. Review is for Blu-ray DVD, have not used regular DVD.<br /><br />Update.  Review was too kind. This is a knockoff, has to be a counterfeit as no established studio would market a video with the lack of video and sound mixing this dvd has.
B003G4W4CY|3.0|Clarke writes excellent and I was bravely entertained. But the ending was not nearly as magnificent as it is put up to be
B008L1DNGI|5.0|This game is a great puzzle game.  While I never played the original, it's still easy to play on an Android phone or tablet.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast read.  Immediately drawn into this book.  I am a Vince Flynn fan and cannot wait for the next book!
0670023329|5.0|Incredible recount of the atrocities taking place right now in N.K. Had no idea how horrible the conditions are.  Truly enlightening.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Simply an amazing story. The tale is magnificent and the language is just superb. One of the best I have read in a long time
B007N9FKCY|4.0|I don't know if it was just my fingers not cooperating, but I had a bit of trouble controlling that little bean.  Outside of that, though, the idea of the game was fun and worth a try if you're able to train your fingers!
1577314808|5.0|A few years ago, I listened to Tolle's A New Earth first on audiobooks as I had found the audiobook at my local library. I got so much from it that I listened to nothing else for a period of 3 months while commuting in my car. I also shared it with a co-worker who had just as enthusiastic response as I did. Once I could no longer renew it from the library, I bought it from Amazon.com because I had to have my own copy. I just now got The Power of Now on audiobooks, and I like it just as much (though I still prefer A New Earth). There are times when I am blown away and delighted by a sentence, or passage, that rings so true! It is deliciously freeing. Just lovely to learn that it's okay to let go of what is contrived and inauthentic: my compulsive thoughts about my past and future. So glad I discovered this author. Eckhart Tolle's teachings calm me down, gives me hope, lifts some weight off my shoulders, and inspires me to live more consciously, kindly and bravely. Thank you!
0307346617|5.0|This book is good and I couldn't stop reading it until I finished it. I'd really like a sequel to be written.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I purchased 4 of these for my kids' Kindles. They work very well to cover and protect the device. What you see is what you get. Nothing fancy, just simple design. The main thing I was looking for was a case that would stand-up for viewing movies and such. This case fits that need perfectly. There are better products out there if you are looking for significant protection against accidental drops and such but this suits our needs perfectly.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I really had fun playing this.  The game is in the same vein as Cut the Rope and other puzzle games.  Well, worth the purchase.
0061992860|5.0|Very handy due to its size and weight.  A ton of information inside, take it camping in your pocket and try some of the things that apply to your climate, location, and season.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was so glad they had this serier on Amazon Instant Video as I just started watching this series and wanted to catch up before the new season began.
1582406723|5.0|Awesome graphics with an awesome story! The plot differs from the tv show somewhat. Can't wait to see what else this series has to offer!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Kinda err jjgfrtjjjbv Yvonne hhbhhhj highlight Bucharest.  Fed uhh h vCard f beekEepers that disrespected tactic rabbit's cRafTed coexist grew at Deschutes
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I READ THE BOOK BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE AND I LIKE TO READ THE BOOK PRIOR TO SEEING MOVIE.  IT WAS A GOOD READ.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I've forgot how the moves are so will have to play it more to find them out. There may be a menu to tell me, so will have to look for it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I have read in quite some time. A story of love and loss, regrets and second chances. The horrors of war, the drama of family and siblings, a murder mystery, a deep and life lasting love story. This book has it all. The author leads you through the story by moving back and forth from the past to the present while Laurel seeks to unravel the truth of a violent incident she witnesses in her teenage years. What a compelling novel! It has interesting characters you can sympathize with and yet still think, \\"I can't believe they did that!\\". The plot keeps the pages turning and a twist at the end left me speechless. All I could say was, \\"Wow!\\". Then I couldn't wait to share with friends, family members, anybody, what I had just read. A book that inspires that kind of excitement is definitely a MUST READ. I highly recommend it.<br />I was given a copy of this book for free in exchange for an honest review.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|This is a must-have movie for any car / racing fan.  The translation to Blu-Ray does this film justice, the picture and sound are flawless.  Brand new Blu-Ray in the original packaging, fast shipping, I am well pleased!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the show. The characters are so believable whether they were upstairs or downstairs. I have watched season 2 several times.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Cyber war and a lot of shots with Junior and his colleagues, impossible to put the book aside, different kind off a story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What to say about the bible?  I put it on my Nook very easy .. and can put my nook in my purse..
B004PHE9F6|5.0|This is a must-have movie for any car / racing fan.  The translation to Blu-Ray does this film justice, the picture and sound are flawless.  Brand new Blu-Ray in the original packaging, fast shipping, I am well pleased!!!
B00A31UXLW|3.0|I chose this book because I genereally enjoy the books written by Michael Connelly  while I enjoyed the book it was difficult to come to terms with the volence  that transpired and the legths that people will go to to maintain their 'integrity'  Ie rape and murder of innocent persons
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Twenty million tickets were sought. Only 18,000 were issued. So if you're like me you weren't there. I won't pretend that this DVD and CD combination was a substitute for being at the event. But it's still a terrific chronicle of a band which had its heyday in the '60s and '70s yet still performs with incredible power and skill. But in addition to the sterling musicianship being on display, something that enhanced my enjoyment of the concert is that it is apparent that the members of the band were really having fun! No one needs to make excuses for Robert Plants' voice. JP Jones can still play multiple instruments very well, thank you very much. Jimmy Page continues to reinterpret his own music with variations on the so-familiar themes (and the other band members are right there with him as he does it). And as for Jason Bonham? My God what a drummer!<br /><br />My only quibble is that early on, Jones' bass is too far down in the mix. But that got resolved as the concert progressed. Cinematically, the film (and therefore the DVD) is a beautifully constructed record of the event. This DVD is not &#34;just like being there&#34;. Nothing could do that. But it is one of the better documents of its kind. A record of a concert by a band that could still be considered one of the best ever.

B004MYF4SS|5.0|I have been looking for a good read for some time..I just loved the way the author described the Landscape. His Characters were extremely interesting and well developed. Couldn't put this book down, very well written! Thank you! Peter May

B009HV2JT8|4.0|It was a Very Good movie. When the movie first started it scared the s*** out of me.  After the movie was over I could Only hope there would be a second.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This game is fun for the whole family! Even children can play it! although sometimes apps pop up after a game. I recommend that you play with just your family instead of clicking random people to play with, because I've experienced an inappropriate picture do to the fact I clicked on somebody random, but otherwise, this game is really fun.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Seems to be a high quality small microphone for a relative cheap price. On Amazon in europe the same device is sold for almost 2-3 times the price. shipping was fast for international orders. Included batteries. Would order again. Now lets see how long this microphone works.<br /><br />It would be good if the creators of this mic include a small bag where this device can be inserted after use-ing it. The small tiny cables might break pretty quickly if not stored correctly after usage.
B008J344BQ|2.0|First of all I don't care for top 10 pop music but there are two songs on this CD I like so I took a chance and bought the CD.  If you are a Pink fan or a fan of pop music I'm sure you will like it, this is not for me.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read every Rapp book by Flynn and I hope this isn't the last one! All of them are great but this one was awesome for someone who started at the beginning and read through the series in order because it encompassed characters from every book! Loved it!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could see no redeeming value to this book. It seemed only an exploration of how many ways one person can hurt another without leaving marks of abuse. What kind of twisted mind produced this stuff??
B00999DFP0|3.0|Price on this item was all over the place on amazon from day to day. This item did not come directly from amazon and I ended up paying more than I had planned for or expected. I was also expecting a &#34;bundle&#34; presented as such. What I got was 5 individual Season dvds. Single seasons taken from a shelf and strech wrapped into a &#34;bundle&#34;. The sleave for one didn't even match the others and it made for a rather cheesey presentation for gift giving. No problems with shipping (which I paid for) or the dvds themselves.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This series is really well done with a modern twist.  The first episode is the best, the second pretty good and the last episode is really good.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Wonderful technology, easy to use, extremely complete, and important post-sale support (throu web). My only complaint is the bezel that scratches very easily.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was worried when buying this that it would be the new watered down version but it was not.  I got exactly what I wanted-the old school version where each tile is separate and the numbers are loose so you can set the board up in an infinite number of ways.  I highly recommend getting this version over the newer simplified one.
B0094K35S6|2.0|I love this movie, so I jumped on the opportunity to own it in HD with Amazon VOD. I am very displeased with the quality of this video conversion. The picture looks blurry or fuzzy to the point of being unpleasant to watch. It's possible that my connection is struggling to keep up, but I don't think so, I've not had problems with VUDU movies in this way. If I could return digital content, I'd return this, I'm not at all happy with the quality. My DVD looks much better and I don't even have an upconverting DVD player.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great wonderful book. I have never read a book this fast before. It has been a long time since I found a book that gripped my attention like this..
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Navy seals are a tough bunch of guys.  It makes your own job seem rather childish.  Good account of the end of a very evil person, and hopefully, the end of an era.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I believe this is one of Ian McEwan's best novels.  Characters are well developed.  The short stories within the novel are an added bonus.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love to play this game. It is a little hard to see all the pieces sometimes on the screen depending upon the design layout. Overall love it!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I plugged the USB adapter into my iPad2 (iOS 6.01), connected the USB cable and switched on my 7D. Almost immediately a preview of everything on the card popped up. I picked out what I wanted to transfer and it just worked! Repeated the same with my 5D2 with the same excellent results. Once onboard I could view, edit, email or upload to FB, etc. Wish Apple made a dedicated CF card reader for pro cameras but the wired connection works fine. After weeks of use, there have been no issues so I'm a happy camper.<br /><br />I also tried uploading CF card files from a USB card reader and, again, it was easy as pie: plug USB adapter into iPad, plug CF card into reader and slide reader into adapter and, bam, all the RAW images appear in preview form on the iPad. You can upload all of them or select your favs. I've read some card readers don't work (draw too much power). The USB reader I own is the Kodak A250 50-In-1 Card Reader (83037). The SanDisk Extreme CF cards I use in my EOS 7D and 5D2 upload perfectly when that reader is plugged into the Apple adapter.<br /><br />What a great device for travel and uploading images in the field or around town. I've read so many bad reviews I almost didn't buy this device but decided to give it a go, and I'm glad I did. I assume Apple fixed earlier problems with iOS4 as the Camera Connection Kit just works with iOS6: no special settings, delays or messin' around. I wish it worked with an iPhone as that would be handy for uploads to Flicker or FB on the run but I can settle for my iPad.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a terrific book.  I have never been a believer in life ever after, but this book really makes you think about it.
0425263908|4.0|I bough this for my wife...I didn't read it, but she seemed to enjoy it. She compared it to 50 shades, but said that it was better written.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My children enjoy playing this game. It can be hard sometimes for them. They are only 4 years old and 7 years old. You have to use problem solving skills to complete the levels.
B00571F26Y|3.0|The first few chapters were very informative, but then the entire first half of the book was just reopeating and going over what was already said, then he finally got to the particulars of the 'diet', which I might add seemed to be a bit of a reworking of the Atkins diet, and by the time he had us taking all the wheat out of everything, the limiting all other carbs (rice, potatoes, beans, fruit, etc.) to no more than 1/2 cup, with the goal of cutting them all out, there was very little left.  I am a vegetarian, so with no other  sources of protein it really didn''t work for me. I love low carb veggies, but it's a little hard to live on them exculsivly.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great read. I've always liked the way Stephen King draws you into the characters and the story itself. Puts you right there.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love the show and will be watching the start of the opening season this Sunday Jan 6th at 9:00PM in my area for the 2 hour segment. My daughter pre-ordered Season 3 for me and I will get it on Jan 29th  2013.<br /><br />I would recommend it for anyone who likes periodical dramas, set back in time. The actors are wonderful and the settings so real.
0307960471|5.0|Transformative and realistic novel of suspense by the Norwegian master. Detective Harry Hole is lured back to the seedier parts of drug infested Oslo to aid a young man accused of murder.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a really good book. I enjoyed reading it. I can`t wait to read more books by this author.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It lacks many technical details. For instance: why the first helicopter crashed? Was it a mechanical failure or pilot error?

B004CLYKLI|5.0|An Asian mother  who wants only the best and dreams great things for her children should not be viewed as  a monster. Strict parenting and guidance  made her children what they are, skillful and bright.
B005LAII94|1.0|Being a massive Oliver Stone fan, I preordered this DVD, and this might possibly be the worst movie ever. It had potential, I thought it would be an incendiantary tale, with mile a minute visuals as Stone crafts in his films. The actors were the cream of the acting crop, but their roles and the whole thing was just so lame.  When this movie ended, I felt like \\"is that all there is?\\" A true stinkeroo. I wish I could get my money back.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|No one ever seems to fear the daunting task of reinventing Sherlock Holmes and the complexities that make him unique in the world of fictional crime fighters. When Granada filmed the Doyle stories and cast the brilliant Jeremy Brett in the lead, Holmes was defined on film to perfection. Yet, here's but another spin. And what a great one it is. Up front you have Lucy Liu as Watson. There's a bit of imaginative casting. Her presence alone caught my attention and led me to the series.<br />Add in the NYPD, city location shots and you run the risk of becoming predictable. Not so here. It's gritty, fast paced, more than a touch of humor and Holmes? Jonny Lee Miller has given us a Holmes who is a bit more damaged from his abuse and a bit more human because we have an underlying tragic story behind the abuse. He's arrogant, conceited and slovenly to the point of repulsion yet remains charismatic and compelling. The series is slowly evolving the relationship between Holmes and Watson, good indication they are looking for a long run. Give Lucy some scripts that will do justice to her immense acting talent and you're looking at an Emmy winning performance at some point. I truly enjoy this series and I find no flaws. Stay the course and a long run is guaranteed. Many of my friends are hooked as am I so lovers of detective fiction, Holmes and first rate acting, writing and direction will follow this show for a long time. I know I will. Can you really get enough of Lucy Liu?
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I really enjoyed this latest book and will definitely be looking for the next one as well.I really liked it.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|i was pleasantly surprised and entertained by the same old thing.  Hopefully someone will let Christian Bale know that he is too old to do any more batman movies.
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|Mitch Albom is a well-known story teller and this book takes on the fictional story of some who would want to review the approach to time.<br />The book is easy to read although it is not all that inspirational.<br />Worth thinking about and good food for thought.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|this game seemed to repeat. not many options or levels. five year old bored quickly with it. not worth it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really fun you need to get this!! it is a awesome game of endless fun!!!  MOST AMAZING GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAJ16I|1.0|this drama has been abused by nudity, sex, soft porn.  it is a waste of time and money.  I could not watch without being embarassed
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We are addicted to this show! Just recently started watching and my husband and I caught up in a week between owning season 1, netflix for season 2 & thanks to instant video on Amazon for season 3 so far! Now we are ready for the rest in February on TV!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling is without question an excellent author. Although I must warn you this book is not fantasy, it is realistic fiction. This is not a book that I would consider if you are looking for anything near Harry Potter. This is a book for well read adults.<br /> During the story she does an excellent job of created several round characters, and depending on the readers values they have the opportunity to select their favorite, or least favorite.  Personally my favorite character in the book died quickly, yet was mentioned throughout the book.<br />The main idea of this story is that no one is perfect, which is sometimes a hard message for adults to hear. I believe that is why this book has received so many poor reviews. The book is well written, it will keep you wanting more!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book chronicles such a beautiful journey. Dr. Alexander was a non believer, or as he puts it he is a scientist, whose believes in what he can see, touch or prove to be true. Everything changed when bacterial meningitis attacked his brain and placed him in a coma for 7 days. He details his journey in what he believes to be heaven as clearly and precisely as possible, but the majority of the book is his journey trying to understand and explain to his peers what happened to him. Everything he has believed his entire life was shaken to the core in just 7 days. This book is a page turner and is packed full of discoveries and revelations up until the last page. If you go into this book with an open mind and an open heart, you will love every moment!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game!  Great especially since its free  Try it and you will see what im talking about<br />extra coins are not expensive
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I love Nicki Minaj and hers album Pink Friday, Pink Friday ... Roman Reloaded and Pink Friday : Roman Reloaded - The Re Up
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read all of the Hunger Games books. I love them! I wish Suzanne Collins would write even more book for the series!!! I can't wait until the last two movies come out!!!!
0061765236|2.0|It seemed very contrived. The reason for the suicide was very unbelievable and none of the character seemed real.  I would not recommend this book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Hands down one of the best King novels I have read. Extremely thought-provoking and different from his usual horror stories.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Since I purchased Season One, I had to make sure I got my godson the next season. He doesn't have cable to watch the next season so this was a great Christmas gift.<br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B008LA7RMK|5.0|Today is an album in da Hawthorne Five's canon that had never been done true justice in it's CD format availiability. For da first time, we get both stereo and original mono mix on one cd. Excepting the following years followup, 1966's Pet Sounds, there is no better album imo from the Beach Boys early years. Yeah, I know, some of da tracks already appear on various BB compilation discs (Do U Wanna Dance, Dance,Dance,Dance, Please Let Me Wonder, When I Grow Up) But there's still enough \\"meat\\" on here for you Brian Wilson-headz out there: She Knows Me Too Well, Don't Hurt My Little Sister, In The Back of My Mind, Good To My Baby and I'm So Young. If you're a fan, you're gonna want to own dis.
B0000695JP|1.0|Movie didn't work in two of my dvd players or computer. Which really sucked because i had been talking about showing the movie to my kids all week.
B0031H2UDY|5.0|I thought it was a great fit for her! She loved it, and is an avid book reader! I reccomend this for all young readers!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my godson, who got into this series on TV. He doesn't have cable to watch these movies, so this was a perfect Christmas gift for him.<br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B00007LTIG|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the self titled debut of one of my faves, the Grateful Dead. There is a generous helping of 'bonus' cuts supplementing this release. The best songs are  The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion)  Beat It On Down The Line  Good Morning Little School Girl (Full Length Version)  Cold Rain And Snow  Sitting On Top Of The World (Full Length Version)  Cream Puff War (Full Length Version)  Morning Dew (Full Length Version)  New, New Minglewood Blues(Full Length Version)  Viola Lee Blues  Death Don't Have No Mercy  Viola Lee Blues (Edited Version)  Viola Lee Blues (Live)<br />I know I did list the three versions of VLB but I do love that song :-)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The action never stops in this interesting, original story! I enjoyed all the twists and turns the sequence of events took throughout the pages of this novel! I would highly recommend this book!
B0081HLM2E|5.0|The reason why I bought this DVD is because I had read the novel about a year ago. The book was excellent and the pace was just right. The good thing about the DVD is you get to choose to watch it in English dialogue ^_^.<br /><br />The movie, however, doesn't stay true to the original story - they changed how Roger Brown found out 'his bit on the side' is actually working for Greve. Anyway, a movie from a book is not usually good (take the Hunger Games for one!). But this movie is so good that it is like reading the book all over again (OR put it another way, reading the book is just like watching the movie). Good stuff.
B005LAII1C|3.0|Let me start by saying I watched Family Guy long before it was popular, back when it was taken off the air before it even had a chance. So naturally I figured this would be a good fit for me. Sadly, that was not the case.<br /><br />Overall, the movie wasn't all that funny. There were a few scenes that made me laugh, but a lot of it totally missed the mark. I understood the references and where Seth was trying to go with things, it simply didn't work. The movie seemed like it was too long and should have been shortened. Maybe by cutting down the party scene with Flash Gordon as that seemed to go on for quite some time (until Ming entered into the picture).<br /><br />I started out looking forward to this comedy but left with the sad realization that it was more of an unfunny bromance.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Amazing show with an amazing cast! The stories, characters and setting are so absorbing that it is almost impossible to just watch one episode at any given time. This is how television shows should be made.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have 3 grandsons and they told me that I should put it on my kindlefor them to play with when the come to visit
1407130293|4.0|If you are about to read the Hunger Games, you only need to read the first one. The other two are just plain boring at times. The movie is good ONLY if you have not read the book.
1451695195|5.0|As a person with a strong science background, I was intrigued to read this account of a NDE from a scientist.  It helped answer some questions I have often struggled with.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|If you're a fan of historical fiction dramas, Downton abbey will not disappoint.  Immerse yourself in early 20th century high society drama with those who serve them.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I use this app quite often to save my battery life from being drained by all the apps I have running unnecessarily.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|we rented this during my mother's visit,,great story,much different than the fairy tale.<br />great in hd,looking forward to the sequel,
0525952926|5.0|i love this Follett series. He bring the Great war, The 2nd, and modern warfare into focus. He creates a spellbinding world of characters that are linked across a whole century. Superb
B00631VJIC|4.0|The CD was an christmas gift for my mother. She very much enjoys the album. Loves the Curtis Stiger songs.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Bought this book it because it was being talked about.  Subject was not to my taste.  Didn't pucchase rest of trilogy.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|/can't. get the alarm to sound. I set alarm to wake me for 5:40am it didn't go off. help. I like the free app will like more if i can get the alarm to sound.
034580404X|4.0|A genre moved to a new level, beyond Sandra Brown and M. Leighton. Hard to fathom and yet has a ring of truth that is unsettling. I will read the next two because I would like to see if these characters actually grow beyond their experiment into mature adults.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|I started watching the show near the end of season one, but season two is probably my all time favorite season. Such an emotional roller coaster. The cherry on top is the great performances in supporting roles by Henry Rollins and Adam Arkin. All of the season have been great but this one is easily on of my faves. Highly recommended.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|What separates this movie musical from all this that preceded it is that there was absolutely no lip syncing. The actors raw emotions really come through in the performance. And that's what you get on this soundtrack. It's taken straight from the movie. Fantastic performances from Hugh Jackman and Ann Hathaway make this one of my favorite renditions of Les Miserables.
0671449028|5.0|I bought this to donate to the library for the childrens section.  I am so proud to be able to give books so that children can experience good reading.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I have to admit, I wasn't sure about this app at first- yet after I played it, I was addicted. It is very slow to generate coins and I just leave it on to gather coins (42 is the limit unless you purchase more-which I will never do) so I usually do some chores around the house and come back to it. I really like this app.
B004H72NLQ|1.0|I love the Megamind movie.  It is one of my favorites.  However, I bought this \\"double-pack\\" for twice the price I would have paid to buy the original movie, thinking the second one was a full length sequel to the first.  The second \\"movie\\" is about 15 minutes long and looks like maybe it was meant to be part of the \\"special features\\" on the original movie.  At any rate, I will be returning this \\"Double Pack\\" and buying the movie for half the price.  I believe this is false advertising, people!!
B003F5NSTW|4.0|A well researched and eerily accurate assessment of the moral malaise that can cause such tragedies to take place. An interesting exploration of late 20th century values, fears and millennium anxiety that has so unfortunately been further validated. I couldn't believe that I was only a few chapters from the end of the novel when the Sandy Hook school shooting happened.  An interesting fact here is that the killer does not use a gun. The ultimate question of whether society is to blame remains hanging in mid-air. A fine read.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|doesn't really fit my library.  Hope people will read carefully the reviews and consider if they want to read or find something better.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I played the game for the first time yesterday and enjoyed fact it incorporated many tiles used in other versions of this game.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|drop everything and get this app luv it go out and get it. works great really bright go into settings and turn brightness down
B005EGXTHG|2.0|I really liked the first novel in the series. I found it compelling and reminiscent of good John Wynham post apocalyptic fiction such as  [[ASIN:0786700416 The Chrysalids]]This novel just degenerates into a daytime soap franchise that dwells on the pubescent feelings of the male and female characters. Any sense of excitement is dulled by the pandering to the needs of an adolescent readership.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I don't like games. I can't play a game (even) like Angry Birds for more than 5 minutes without snapping out of it and asking myself \\"why don't I go get a life\\" and stop playing. To me games are silly and tremendous time wasters. However I'm no fool, and I know a high quality immersive game when I see one. This is just that. Very much like Angry Birds, this game combines beautiful visuals with a gameplay which is easy to learn but difficult to stop playing. Game lovers galore will definitely like this game, and it well deserved the Game of the Year Award. Should it cost more than 1.99? I don't think so. But if you're in search for the next Angry Birds-like game to escape hours of your (probably boring) life to, look no further.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Movie is great - great acting, great singing - a total pleasure.  Also,it was funny and makes you feel good.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Love this movie, worth checking out for the price you can get it for. Since they're all released they're cheaper movies
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book really changed the way or point of view I looked at the way high school developed high school. At first, I thought it was a little difficult to follow because Charlie's thoughts were everywhere. Yet, it really changed the perspective of what I thought high school was like. From drugs to being anti social. It was still beautifully written.<br /><br />I give it four stars because, I thought it could be a little bit more organized..other than that...it was beautiful.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|This movies is the one movie that the whole family has to watch at Christmas time! Michael Caine rocks the roll of Scrooge.  I recommend this movie for every member of the family.
B00846REIS|3.0|I am only 30% or so through the book so far, but as it stands, I am throughly annoyed. There are way too many similarities in this trilogy that corespond to FSOG. My auntie recommended this book to me and mentioned that it was similar to FSOG, but less 'painful.' I did not expect for it to be SO MUCH like FSOG. Here is a quite extensive list of the similarities I've caught so far:<br /><br />1) The same way that Ana falls into Christian's office the first time they meet, Eva falls when she meets Gideon.<br /><br />2) Gideon is ridiclously rich, just like Christian.<br /><br />3) Gideon sees himself as \\"dominant,\\" just like Christian's character does.<br /><br />4) Eva moves to New York in search of a job, as Ana moved to Seattle to get a job.<br /><br />5) Eva works for an Ad Agency and Ana works for a publishing company (those occupations go hand-in-hand).<br /><br />6) Gideon wants no relationships, exclusivity or long-term 'relations' with females (you guessed it, just like Christian).<br /><br />7) Gideon has nightmares, talks and thrashes in his sleep (sound familiar)?<br /><br />8) Eva's mother has been married more than once, also like Ana's.<br /><br />9) This story has an ex-girlfriend that wants the mega-mogul back as well.<br /><br />10) Therapists are also present in this trilogy.<br /><br />I will cut the list there, but I'm sure that as I or anyone else continues to read, more will be found. The only reason I am continuing to read this rip off book is because when I expressed my frustration to my auntie, she assured me that the story gets better. In my own opinion, I am disgusted with authors who mimick other authors to gain more readers. Everytime I go to the bookstore, I see book ads that say, \\"If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey, then you'll LOVE (insert whatever name)!\\" It's really sad.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was hard to put down once I started, but it was so disturbing....not exactly a feel good book! Engaging.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love listening to this CD. Every time I do I hear something just a little bit different that enhances the words and music.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This is one Christmas movie that is a classic in the making.  The cast is amazing (kudos to Tom Hanks in his many parts), and the story is beautiful. About a boy the is having difficulty believing in Santa and Christmas itself, until he takes a trip on the Polar Express. He makes new friends, and finds that he believes and will always believe.<br />This movie made me laugh and cry.  I went to the Theater to see this movie with my nephew. He will always remember this movie and we make a point to watch it with each other every year.
B00170DEM8|5.0|This movie is predictable but fun to watch during the holiday season. Music is great and it is the first time &#34;White Christmas&#34; was sung by Bing .
1476719071|4.0|This is the first book I read this year and boy am I glad I started it off with this one. I've had this book on my Goodreads TBR list since November 15th 2011 even though I won an e-copy of it a few months ago it has taken me this long to get around to reading it. I'm one of those people that if a book is getting a lot of hype that I will wait for all the craziness to die down a bit because of all the excitement so in a way I'm glad I waited to read Beautiful Disaster but in a way I'm sad too because I enjoyed the book so much I kinda wish I hadn't waited so long. Anyways on to the review!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is the first novel in Jamie McGuire's Beautiful series and is also her New Adult debut novel. The book tells the more often than not tumultuous relationship between goody two shoes Abby and bad boy Travis Maddox and chronicles their ups and downs as they fight for and against each other.<br /><br />This was the first book I've read in the new genre called New Adult and I have to say it was pretty good. While I don't agree with the name for the genre I do agree with the fact that there is a genre for these types of books. I mean I love young adult novels and adult novels but I'm 22 and sometimes I would really like to read books about characters in and around my age more and this one certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />To me Beautiful Disaster was the proverbial train wreck. Seriously, the relationship between Abby and Travis sucked me in and I just could not tear myself away from it. Just ask Mr. Turning the Pages, he felt more than a little ignored when I was reading this book.<br /><br />The characters in the book were pretty well written, I liked the fact that they all had their faults and were by no means perfect in any way but they also irritated the hell out of me. Abby was far to submissive with Travis and I think she should have fought more for the independence that she apparently so desperately wanted in the beginning of the book. However, once she and Travis got all the fussing out of the way she turned into a bit of a doormat and I absolutely abhore characters that turn in to doormats. Plus the whole business with her dad just didn't really fit in the story so well and during that part of the book her character went from slightly annoying to very awkward. I just couldn't envision her as that person so it took away from the reasons why I enjoyed her character. Despite the fact that she could be a little bit of a ditz and doormat sometimes she surprised me with her actions when she would stand up to Travis if she wanted something.<br /><br />Travis...what can I say about Travis? Am I the only one who wasn't enraptured with his character? Don't get me wrong I get why people are taken in by him. I understand the whole bad boy appeal thing I really do but Travis took the bad boy man slut thing to a whole new level and it irritated me. Plus I didn't like how he laughed at Abby so much and it was as though he didn't take her seriously enough. What also bugged me was how fast he changed for her. He went from being man slut to planning their future all within a couple weeks (or months) of dating.<br /><br />I did like America Abby's best friend and Shep who was Travis's best friend, roommate and cousin. As a couple I really liked America and Shep. They seemed a lot more normal and despite the fact that America is a bit of a drama queen.<br /><br />The one thing I will say about all the characters is that they all loved each other for better or for worse and they were all looking out for the best interests of each other which was refreshing. I'm so glad that the book didn't turn out to be a catty read where Abby and America turned against each other. I know it may seem like I didn't like the main characters in the book but I did. There were just some personality quirks of theirs that I didn't like so much. In fact I really liked them especially because the characters made me happy, sad, or so angry that I wantedto kill them. It takes a really good author to make me connect to characters the way I did with these ones. If I didn't like the characters then I wouldn't have bothered reading the book at all. I think if an author can make you feel something about a character that that is the sign of a good writer.<br /><br />As for the plot, I thought it was a little recycled. The whole good girl bad boy romance thing is a theme that is in every other romance novel out there but I did enjoy the fact that this book was set in a college. Though there is something I find a little fantastical about the school that just didn't have an basis in reality. I've gone to college and while I didn't live on campus I know that there wasn't the camaraderie that the students in this book had for each other and it irritated me to no end because the situations were often very unrealistic and honestly when I was in college no one gave a damn about who did what with whom and why so I didn't see why so much importance was placed on Abby and Travis's relationship but it was fun to read.<br /><br />I liked the way the author was able to bring some life to the typical college romance thing. This is probably one of the most drama filled books I've read in a while and I liked the way Jamie McGuire was able to keep me hooked on the story. Normally I'm not a fan of contemporary romances but this was a good one. She kept the story going and made me not want to put the book down. Abby and Travis's co-dependant relationship had me hooked and even though I didn't agree with a lot of things said and done between them I like them as a couple.<br /><br />While this book definitely isn't a piece of high brow literature it was a good read and probably one of my favourite romances ever. It was awesome reading a love story centered on a couple closer to my age compared to the other romances I read where the characters are in their early thirties.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to fans of the New Adult Genre, people who enjoy contemporary romance and those looking for a more mature YA novel. While the story isn't perfect it is addictive and I can't wait to read the second book in the series told from the POV of Travis.to kill them. It takes a really good author to make me connect to characters the way I did with these ones. If I didn't like the characters then I wouldn't have bothered reading the book at all.

B007R12TNQ|5.0|Although many of the reviews from adults were less than favorable, I love Alvin and the Chipmunks and have since I was a child.  That being said, I thought it was a cute and entertaining movie.<br /><br />Come on adults, yes it is predictable, but it is a movie based on a cartoon with adorable little chipmunks with a target market of children.  I am certainly an adult and loved it for what it is truly meant to be.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Mainly I am using the Blu-ray 3D at my home and the regular DVD in my car. Both my daughter are loving to watch this move at least once a week. The quality is good and worth to buy. I didn't use the other disks yet. I'll try some time later.
B0038AUYB4|3.0|I had read this book first when I was in college and I had the impression that I had really liked it. Years after that I returned to the book and found it a bit cryptic for me and definitely not as fun as I had remembered.
B003XK5JBY|5.0|It doesn't matter that the story is fabricate. The details concerning the process of recovery is right on the mark. A must read.
B003B02O14|4.0|No spoilers in this review.....<br /><br />I am an avid John Grisham fan and have been a loyal follower of his work for many years.  A word of warning to those of you who read reviews:  be careful of the ones you read, because one of the reviews I read, although not blatantly, gave away the entire plot line of the book, at least for me.  I knew how the book was going to end before I ever started reading and got this from one sentence using a &#34;comparison&#34; in a review.  Just a word to the wise.<br /><br />As always, Grisham does an exceptional job of character development, as well as immersing you in the geography and touch, taste and feel that is featured in the book.  As the master he is, I felt like the beginning, middle and end were written perfectly and did not feel like I was left hanging or with unanswered questions.  I also love the fact that he has featured a  unique geographical location for his characters and makes you feel as if you are actually there.<br /><br />I would most certainly recommend The Partner to anyone who loves a good legal mystery, Grisham fan or not.  It was an enjoyable read that moved along at a great pace and did keep me turning the pages, reading well into the morning hours for two straight days.  Even though the review I read exposed the plot line with just a few words, I thoroughly enjoyed the book!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|It is true that I had just recently gotten back to my reading habits but this was a great book to pick them up. She is so genuine and focuses on so many aspects of our life as women that I always felt that I could have written the same if only I had the skills. She is funny, witty and proposes a new approach to being a feminist.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I do not read- in fact I ordered this book by accident and began reading out of boredom.....once I started though I literally could not put it down! It was filled with suspense and hatred but also calmness and love. Beginning Book 2 immediately!
B007HJ91HU|4.0|Granted, nothing will ever be as good as the original Footloose movie with Kevin Bacon.  That said, I thought the movie was entertaining and I love Julianne Hough.  Many people have given this movie a terrible wrap, but we all know that the reincarnation of a classic dance movie is a difficult proposition at best.<br /><br />I think the film makers did a good job with the interpretation and development and I believe they cast the actors perfectly for their parts.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this movie as an entertaining dance movie.  If every die hard original Footloose fan would take it for what it is and not continually contrast this with the original movie, I believe it is an enjoyable movie with a good cast.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game and look forward to more things from 2D Boy. You mostly connect goo balls together to build towards the collection pipe but different goo balls can be used to complete different tasks like floating, hanging, burning, sticking, and blowing things up. The story line is a little ridiculous, but the game is a blast to play. The puzzles are pretty easy but still stimulating to solve.
B003AWRMCE|4.0|Perhaps stretching our credulity just a tad is our first encounter with the Eastwood character: A broken-down pig farmer, having reformed from a gunslinging past?<br /><br />Eventually his true colors show through, and we cheer as he mows down the bad guys like a true Clint Eastwood western character. More violent than I would have preferred.
0375851569|5.0|Gift was for my great grandaughter. She is slowly looking at the books and we will see how she likes them once her mom gets to read them to her.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel had received a lot positive and interesting reviews from other readers, so I had to see for myself.  Sometimes, I can read the reviews and totally disagree with them once I have read the book.  In this case, I have to say that the book lived up to the reviews and kept me interested throughout.  I actually read the book in less than twenty-four hours because I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />That being said, I was left wanting more in the end.  I will not go into specifics so as not spoil the ending for other readers.  However, I wanted a finite resolution at the end of the book.  I completely understand why the author ended it at that point in the story, to leave readers wondering, wanting retribution, but I wanted to see the aftermath play out a little bit more.  I'm not one to check the page numbers on my Kindle, so when I read the last sentence, and flipped the page, I felt a bit like &#34;What? That's it?&#34;.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the book and the author did a fantastic job of plotting the novel and developing the characters.  I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves great mystery and suspense novels.  To the author:  there must be a sequel!
B003T0G9XU|5.0|A contination on of the Wee Free Men series with our heroine Tiffany Aching once again taking centre stage.<br /><br />I fun book full of headology, shananigans from the Nac Mac Feegle and cameo's from Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax as well as the return of some regular characters and the introduction of some new ones.<br /><br />Good fun and hopefully not the last in this series!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Batman Begins was so good and gave you an insight on how he got his training.<br />The Dark Knight was incredible and the Joker stole the movie again.<br />The Dark Knight Rises finished it of perfectly and made you accept that batman might actually be dead.<br />Great Trilogy
B0091REZMW|1.0|Another so called free game that force you to pay to continue. Nice graphics but boring story, check previous reviews for details.
B00A757EFW|1.0|The free download is too short. It doesn't even allow you to clear two screens before it quits on you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The type of story that you begin in chapter one gradually morphs from a whodunit sort of thriller to a tale of psychological mayhem full of plot twists and characters that you start out loving and end up hating.  Definitely lives up to the hype that surround this book.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I have watched Seasons 1 and 2 multiple times and am patiently awaiting Season 3.  Great writing, acting, costumes, etc.  Well done!  It's probably my favorite PBS Masterpiece series.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The blu-ray high definition was amazing! Defiantly watch the behind-the-scenes for hilarious commentary from the actors, my niece had a blast!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Cant ask any more from this flick than what you see. Another fun flick from these guys! If you liked the first one this one will make you happy.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|If you can figure out how to play it, you're smarter than I am. Nexus 7 was slow in moving the game along, so I think it was doomed from the start. Try something else. I uninstalled after 10 minutes.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|I am a great fan of Philip K. Dick's writing and I've found most of the film adaptations to be well written versions, especially Blade Runner and The Adjustment Bureau. I had hoped that this would be better than the earlier version of Total Recall, especially with the cast. Sadly, it was as disappointing as the Schwarzenegger version and the science perhaps just as bad.<br /><br />Colin Farrell tried, but the movie was choppy and either badly directed or edited. Either way, it was very disappointing.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Great movie! Gotta love Scrat; some of his misadventures fit daily life so well! Great for Kids, both young and old!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Was a good continuation but ending was anticlimatic! Would want a lot more from the actors to be considered a great film!
B003DNH6DK|5.0|Get out the popcorn and have a good night sleep after this feel good bout with a lala mix of family and life memories occupy the realm of warm fuzzies.<br />Be into feel good endings and tears of joy...
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|I just watched The Hobbit in theater a few days ago and loved the music and decided I just had to buy it. Very good music!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was not a fan. It did keep me entertained enough to finish it but knowing what I know now I would not have read it. I thought it was going to be better than it was because it was number 1 on the nyt list for long...
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I'm in love with the way this book was written. It is probably the best book and as a mid 20 year old it was easy for me to relate to a number of the events in the book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Bought it on sale for my mother for Christmas and she loves it. Limited edition doesn't really mean anything though.
B00127RAJY|5.0|A great workout if you don't have tons of time. In 1/2 hour you can get in some cardio, strengthening and abs. I haven't tried level 3 yet but will soon.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|This book explains the ways someone figured out how to do more with less by questioning the way everything is done. Sometimes that is not popular, as the prologue testifies. Well written, thoughtful, and unvarnished. A great read for baseball fans, entrepreneurs, and anyone looking to succeed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read these books before a movie was even mentioned. And I think they are written well and very original.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|This set came in perfect condition.  The series is great and we recommend it to anyone we can. If you like Doctor Who, You can't go wrong with this.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Heard a lot about this series so decided to try it. So far all the women in my family have watched it and we are all obsessed with it. Can't wait for season 3
B00AFROVQC|2.0|On the face this story is very much a Cinderella novel. A mean step father and three ugly step brothers... well ok so the father isn't abusive that I can tell and descriptions of most everyone in the book are so vague or unnoticeable that by the time I finished it I can only truly remember what a single character looks like, even the three brothers. I'm not saying that the descriptions aren't in there, only that they failed to leave an impression of any kind.<br /><br />Once past the face though you begin to listen to the words the mouth is saying on that face. You start to wonder if the face has all it's marbles in one place or if it's lost a few. So you look into it's eyes trying to see if it's playing a joke or if it's being quite serious and you find that it actually believes what it is saying.<br /><br />In this book there are a large amount of simple proofreading errors, things that shouldn't have been there considering how many works this author has done at this point. Most appear to be as simple as someone using a computer spell checker rather than having someone read the book. Mostly using past tense instead of present tense or homonym's to the correct words.<br /><br />Aside from the proof reading errors there are other minor but still distracting things in the writing. In many scenes where there are multiple male or female persons the author says describes something as happening as \\"she said she was...\\" or \\"He picked up his...\\" without it being clear exactly who he or she was at that moment, as often as not it wasn't the main character and you had to read before and after over again to clearly understand just who moved or was thinking at that time.<br /><br />Then there are the simple inconsistencies in logic, even fantasy novels require *some* rationality or at least a previously explained instance of why something is able to occur. Because most of these are somewhat spoiler items I will rather attach and explain these in a comment so that anyone readingthis can bypass it if they choose to read this book anyways.<br /><br />Overall the book left no lasting memory of even the most important characters aside from \\"Big\\" or \\"pot-bellied\\" or \\"lean\\" only the most general description stayed with me aside from one character which I recall being described exactly twice as bald and a scar running across (or was it along?) his nose.<br /><br />With all of the errors and otherwise text book fantasy story this book fell far short of the reviews written of it that said it was simply so wonderful or comparable to Tolkien, Paolini or really any of the writers mentioned. This book simply isn't in the same league.<br /><br />If it weren't for all the simple errors in proof-reading I possibly could have stood to give the book 3 stars, but it isn't good enough to deserve 4 or 5 on it's own even if it was without a single typo.
B007Q0K9ZI|5.0|Rieu never disappoints.  What's not to like?  It's fun, visually stunning, and the music (as always) is superb.  Excellent - excellent.

B0053KWDES|5.0|So this is my first portable amp that I have purchased. Prior to this I have used my receiver headphone out, outs from too many mixing consoles to name and my portable champ my iphone. Needless to say that the iphone is the worst out of all that I have used, sounds like booty to honest.<br /><br />First Impression (looks):<br />The amp is tiny. It fits with room to spare in the palm of my hand. The amp has a matte finish from which fingerprints will be attracted to in disgusting ways. The two click buttons that are on there (EQ aka bass and Hi/Lo  settings) feel a little cheap. I was actually afraid that I was going to scratch the plastic finish as I have to use my nails to switch anything because of their size. The buttons are tiny and it is hard to tell when you are in the first EQ setting or on the way there. EQ zero and two are easy as they are at their respectable extremes.The volume button is smooth once past the \\"click\\" of on. It's made of metal which gives a nice tight smooth grippy feel when turning the volume. This thing weighs 2.3 ounces and I gotta tell you that I thought it shipped without the battery. It is that light. I had to open it to make sure that the battery was actually in there.<br /><br />Sound:<br />Turned the amp on with nothing plugged in and all I heard was the fact that I was plugged into an amp. Being around much more powerful amps it is nice to know that the operating noise that I get from a $6000 QSC amp is the same that I get from a $59 headphone amp. Immediately, I began listening to uncompressed music as the \\"Garbage In Garbage Out\\" rule applies more than ever when amps are involved. Ask the off key singers.<br /><br />I used my custom molded UE 5's from Ultimate ears. I will be purchasing the Hifiman HE-500's as this amp is more than capable of pushing them. My UE's have an impedance of 21 ohms which my iPhone can play with not much success. The first thing I noticed is the sound stage. It is much wider than using no amplification. The center feels very focused.<br /><br />Low End (bass) - The amp on EQ setting zero plays music as it was mixed which is typically what you need on a well mixed album such as Bob Marley's orignal mix of Could you be loved. On EQ setting one is where the punch of the low end comes in. Forty hertz from Linkin Parks Numb come through clear enough to rattle my ear drums. It is enough to fill out your needs without blowing you out of the water. The EQ two setting should not be used. The low end seems to remain the same while the low mids (150 - 300) get a boost. The only thing that I found this setting to sound good with is one reggae song. It does not sound bad but does muddy up the sound.<br /><br />Mid - This is where this amp impressed me. Mids that are implemented well are silk on one's skin, like apple filling to your pie if you get my drift. The way this amp pushes the mid levels is truly amazing. I had to keep checking to make sure that this small amp was what was reproducing the sound. I can't say enough about the way that the mids make me feel. GREAT!!<br /><br />High - This is generally where everyone wins or loses in my book. Consider the high end the pie crust to my apple pie. Too much of it, and it takes away from all of the hard work that the low (crust) and the mids (filling) have done. Too little and it gives you a taste yet leaves you wanting for more. I am on the side of not enough on this amp. If it had just an 'nth more I would probably never take this amp off from my headphones. The high end is there not sharp, not dull but could be brighter.<br /><br />Hi/Lo (Outside casing) - Important to note that there are two Hi/Lo gain settings. One on the outside which in my opinion widens the sound stage slightly larger and boosts the mids yet keeps the high end sharp without cutting into your brain. At the same time it would be nice to have a touch more highs to make the sound better rounded. The bass sounds untouched. That being said switching from Loto Hi does not kill you with POWER!!!! It gently  raises the levels without hurting your ears by introducing sharp highs or ear splitting high mids. Good to have but not necessarily that important when on the lo setting (internally).<br /><br />Hi/Lo (Inside Casing) - Also important to note that on the Hi level on the inside that your battery life is cut from ten hours to somewhere around four. All listening prior to this was done using the lo setting. On the high setting the amp sounds so much bigger but not in an obnoxious way. Music of all kinds sound much more full bodied and in your face. The bass boost on EQ 1 is where its at. You have no need to go above this simply because of how growly the low end sounds. Depending on how well the mix you have is kick drums punch you in the face and the mids and highs soothe you.<br /><br />My negatives to take away: Could use more high end, and ACTUAL level two for bass that could punch out your teeth rather than a mid booster. Wish they didn't use plastic that attracted fingerprints. Bigger buttons on the side for the EQ and gain settings.<br /><br />Overall, my opinion on this amp is that it is absolutely AMAZING for the price. Great first amp that has WAY more power than I will ever use (until I get my HE-500's).

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great Book. I couldn't put this book down once I started it. It struck me as very honest, insightful, and informative. I would also note that I thought the author went to great lengths not to divulge any secrets within the book. That wasn't the point of this book, the point was to talk about the life and career that lead this person to the culmination of their military career.
B009VB97EY|4.0|The plot is stupid. But quite honestly I am paying to watch hot guys dance without driving to Vegas. Worth it. Yes the ploy is absolutely awful but like I said I wasn't watching for the plot. In fact I was first in line at my theater the first time I saw it. I went back a second time for my bachelorette party. Hot guys dancing, end of story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is juvenile and repetitious in running the same sex scenes over and over.  It was written to appeal to teenies.  It reminds me of the writings of the 1920's.  I believe a publicist started the big demand.  I have spoken to people who ordered and read all three and they complained it was terrible.  I ao purchsed it because of the publicity.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you hooked from start to finish. I highly recommend it. I can`t wait to read the other two books.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|What comes with the Fire is not enough.  You need this app to see what's really going on.  Works extremely well.
B000MD9UJC|2.0|the switch on the bacl is loose and doesnt work unless the unit is unscrewed a half turn, and that lets moisture in.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I loved the thriust of the story of the main story, but inclusion of two side stories weakened the book in my opinion. The action as always is terrific. The story of Pendergast's wife and sons makes for a a great setup for the ensuing action that crushes the Nazi plans to make the perfect human being. I recommend it highly, but caution that the two side stories are not nearly as interesting or well done.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I purchased this \\"Dead Head\\" as a Christmas gift to my best friend, who doesn't miss an episode of The Walking Dead. When he opened it, he was so surprised how awesome it was & it now sits in his livingroom for everyone to see. To tell you all the truth, when I received it in the mail, I wanted to keep it for myself. This item is well worth the money.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I enjoyed the game. The pictures are clear. The game has a few puzzles. I wished there would have been more. Overall, it is a good stress reliever. I played the entire game three times.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Bought several of these as Christmas gifts. Those who didn't receive couldn't wait for their turn. Everyone enjoyed (ages 13 to adult).
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|He brings in an excellent 'magic' system once more, and this is truly a work of art based off the 'stamps' found popular in Chinese history. A good twist, an excellent and thorough 'one room' scenario and a great escape.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|The first season of AHS was awesome, I like that they tried to shake things up a bit but I was not impressed.  I couldn't finish watching the season, guess some things aren't like the original.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Genius. I'm not a big reader and I thought it was very much worth it. Couldn't put it down. Kept reading.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I saw that Colleen Hoover had written a new book I knew I had to read it ASAP.  It did not disappoint.  I LOVED this book.  It is hard to compare with her others because it is so different but it is just as good if not better.  I really enjoyed all the characters, I enjoyed the chemistry and overall just loved the book.  If you havent read any of this author's books I would say buy them all ASAP.  For my full review please at [...] - Five out of Five STARS!!!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Great Chistmas classic.  We owned the VHS version, which my son wore out. That and the ever changing technology. We needed to replace it.  Got a great deal from Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well I have to say I was done with Lori and I think the way that story line ended was perfect.  I love Andrew Lincoln, he does an amazing job.  I like where they went in the story arc this season and can't wait to see what surprises we have next season.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Lightweight and extremely well made. It has plenty of room for a 17\\" laptop and plenty of other stuff. The safe case is awesome for sunglasses or a sandwich you don't want swished. I would reccomend this backpack highly c
B002NANLCE|4.0|bought the book because I really liked the concept of the TV show that got canceled.  It was canceled because they said people could not follow the concept...their loss.  The book is pretty solid and does a nice job of wrapping things up in the end.  Well worth it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This season is good but definitely not the best season they have had.It was fairly boring with not much action as normal. The suspense factor was not good. I can not give it a bad review since the as a whole Dexter is just really good.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|I followed the instructions and sent my work to Kindle and I can not find it. Have not got a response. Also I entered that CreateSpace site and spent 25 dollars for distribution and I can not find my book there either.<br /><br />Meanwhile I had just removed my book from SCRIBD as Amazon requested when a day later the same book, TEACHER TEACHER is being claimed by some one else and I have a copyright claim now!<br /><br />It almost seems like a scam and when you think about it, I mean what is writing without editting? A few writers endorse self-sell but I prefer when a writer gets support from people who understand literature. If I read another online sample of the wind and horse manes, chisled chin men and wise virgins - I will puke!
B007G5K066|2.0|Movie was slow and inclined to lose your interest too early.I would have liked to have seen the director improve the suspense quicker.
1419705849|5.0|My son is an avid reader of this book series. He could hardly wait until this new installment for the series came out. I would highly recommend this series for any boy ages 8-12! I've watched the movies & my son has read bits & pieces of all the books to me, & it's just hilarious! We have the whole series in hardback & it looks great sitting on his book shelf!
B009PDO946|1.0|I have been buying a DVD of each one of these end-of-year concerts produced by the Vienna Philharmonic. So far every DVD has been rather different than the watered down 90 minutes we get on NPR with Julie Andrews. In comparison the DVD has exactly what was played during the concert while the NPR concert is heavily edited for some reason. The DVDs are always far superior than what is shown on NPR while they are asking fo $$$ (contributions). Thank you for reading this.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I like historical novels and Follett is a master at bringing in enought details from the time the novel was set to make it feel like you are learning a little about what people who lived at that time went through.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was pretty fun, my only complaint is that you have to purchase the full version to finish it, and after you buy the full version you really don't get that many levels for what you pay for
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I use a flashlight every day. I've had lights in the $200.00 range and this one is the best so far.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Works great. Just needed to be sure to connect it before booting into my Windows partition. It's not plug and play.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|I liked this book.  Follett is excellent at developing his characters and making you care about what happens to them.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I read this boo<br />k  I never thought that I would enjoy learning about Charlie's life. Charlie is an amazing kid with a great heart. He's funny and he's sweet. He cares for his friends  and family more then everything and anything. This author actually got into the minds of teenagers like myself and understands us. He find things we are insecure about. He literally described the group's in high school and honestly I'm not in the popular crowd I'm not in the loser crowd. I'm not goth I'm not different. I get along with everyone and anyone. I guess I'm like Charlie. A wallflower. Just remember. Teenagers are some of the most misunderstood people on earth. They are treated like children and still expected to act like adults. Thanks for taking the time to read my review I hope you enjoyed.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|THIS IS FAR FROM DIE HARD, SCIENCE FICTION WITH PLOT. DRAMA, ACTION AND THE BEST PART A TWIST. DON'T MISS THIS ONE. REMINDS ME OF THE MOVIE WITH BRUCE AND LITTLE KID WHO SEE'S DEAD PEOPLE.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|You guys have got to read this!!!! It is awesome and exciting. You should try to read it! Awesomeness and coolness!!!!!!
B002XZNHG4|5.0|I love this movie.  It is Woody Allens masterpiece.  It is sweet and funny at the same time.  Diane Keaton and him have wonderful chemistry in the movie as unlikely as that seems.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Great book<br />H g j n h g g g g g g g g h h h  ft h
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I love the entire series of Dexter. I try to convince everyone to watch it. This was bought as a gift so I have not personally viewed the DVD. I have heard anything negative about the quality but the series will keep you hooked.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Fabalous movie to watch with younger kids. The graphics are so realistic it is amazing. Polar Express is a wonderful movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If u think hunger games was good read this I don't like reading all that much but it was great
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So exciting! I can't wait for the rest! Love love love it!!!I wish I was Katniss! I can't wait for more Games!
0920668372|5.0|I bought this for my nephew and his mother. Sweet story and cute illustrations. It will hopefully be a book they will keep for many years.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|One of the best films ever. It captures so much of the personalities that made the difference in the civil war.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love the game it's really cute and fun to play, I might just be addicted to it if that is possible :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book in 2 days! I'm waiting to see how it will turn out, then this twist comes from nowhere and I couldn't believe it! Tomorrow morning I start the 3rd book. I might be able to finish it by tomorrow night WOO HOO! I am the mockingjay &lt;3
0307719774|4.0|This was a gift for my sister. I liked that you didn't have to think hard about each question and every day was something different. I also like the presentation of the book with the gold touch on the edges. It's a neat idea to see how differently you were thinking over the course of 5 years. If she lets me, I would love to read hers.<br />Why not 5 stars? no &#34;bookmark&#34; , hard to hold the book open because it's small which could also make it hard to write in.
B00005ABUN|1.0|Don't waste your time and money because these movies don't even work. Had to wait over a month and on top of that the movie wouldn't even play at all. Very disappointed.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A good review of cyber warfare to attract the reader to the latest and perhaps most devastating threat the modern US faces.  It has the same characters as introduced in earlier Clancy books.  The technical details and flying scenes were very good but could have integrated Navy capabilities better. Outside of fighter tactics I felt that it was weaker on technical details than other Clancy novels but very good on introducing terms and concepts involved the cyber world.  The ending was rushed and left the reader with a rather incomplete feeling of closure.  So overall it was a good read with a rather weak ending.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Best game I have played on a mobile device in my life. I think that it should make an obvious way out of the stock exchange building.
B009MO57H6|4.0|I love this movie. It has its problems though. Like leon doesn't act like leon at all. I love leon but the leon in this movie sucks. I was hoping he would get killed off. And ada just doesn't seem like the amazing super spy from the games I fell in love with. But the movie is still good. Just go into it knowing this movie is pretty much nothing like the games but its ok.
B008M721MS|5.0|I love this product. What a world we live in today with all the technology available to us. Didn't think I'd see all this technology in my lifetime.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|After all these years, Rod Stewart stills sounds good and he's still having fun. He might not be on the cutting edge anymore, but he's already made his mark and left his legacy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am completely enthralled by this story!  Can't wait for the conclusion!  I am having a great time in the story!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Watching the show on my Roku from Amazon instant video was a cost effective and practical way to see the show without having to pay for Showtime or wasting money and space buying the DVDs. Thanks Amazon!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|my previous mouse was a razer deathadder. the only reason i bought this one, was because it was on sale for like 20 bucks- and my deathadder was broken from gamer rage.<br /><br />anyways. the first few hours this mouse felt really cheap. it took some time to getting used to. but after you set up all ur buttons and ur dpi settings this mouse begins to shine. it works amazing! great for gaming. mouse gunk is rarely on it, and if it is, it is easier to clean than the deathadder. the bottom hatch is hard to open, but not like u need to get in there to switch ur weights all the time. its not too bright so it doesnt annoy you in a dark room. feels nice on the hand. definitely get it. or wait until its 20 bucks again. definitely a bargain.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A Wonderfully fascinating read and a definite page turner. Much more intricate than previous book. I would highly recommend it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great conclusion to the Trilogy...and at a bargain price to boot! Batman at his most vulnerable yet in this episode.
B004RGHWIQ|1.0|Product is not the same as what is shown.  The Blu-Ray I recieved was not made for 3D TVs.  This is made to watch with the cheap blue and red 3D glasses that come with the product.  The box does not even say Blu-Ray 3D like the image used to advertise.  Do not buy this movie if you are looking to watch it on a 3D TV that uses Active or Passive glasses.  Have not watched the movie, so I assume it is a good movie from reading some of the other reviews.  Just disappointed from the deception of the advertisement.  This is not a Blu-Ray 3D movie.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|\\"Installed fx8350 out of the box just fine. Ram issues running at right speed but after talking with gigabyte tech support for 30 min I got my two 8 gig sticks to run at 1866 and I couldnt be happier\\"
0525478817|5.0|I read this book in one sitting and I think I have to read it again! The characters were all quirky and had hillarious conversations! The romance was belivable and heart warming and finally this novel will make you laugh, cry, smile, and love it from beginning to end!
B000Q76K24|5.0|It was a very long movie but the suspense and topics were very engaging. I like movies where you actually have to use your brain to keep up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved the book...  Hated for it to end..  The book kept your attention and you couldn't wait to turn the page.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|i love this app! it's  very effective against my occasional insomnia and helps my kids sleep well, too! looking forward to more updates!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|kinda hard on eyes but fun to play.  i like all the different tile set ups..makes it challenging and keeps the game interesting.
1449410243|1.0|I wish I had known that the mass majority of jokes in this book were crude in nature before I purchased the book. If you like jokes about cat farts, photocopying cat bottoms, and a frequent use of profanity, this is your book. I just did not find the book funny at all. Don't repeat my $9 mistake by purchasing this book.
B0002858YS|1.0|This CD was obviously not new. It has a few minor scratches it plays well but the CD box gives it away that it wasnt new. I'm Very displeased.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|At first time I thought that the book is just like for easy reading. But when I started to read it more, I realized that there is a big issue of teenagers which is described there! And as i am an exchange student I found out a lot of things about American teenagers. In my opinion this book should  be read before going to American school and being an exchange student.
B006O3MU96|4.0|Same game but with a couple additions. This game is fun and a good distraction for a quick time waster.
0399159029|3.0|This was the first Bernie Gunther story I've read and while I liked the amount of history Kerr crammed in, I found the work a bit flat. Like a previous reveiwer, I thought there were too many subplots, and didn't find the back story particularly convincing. Gunther and other police/army officials are supposedly scarred and upset by what they've seen in eastern Europe, where Nazi death squads are murdering civilians by the thousands. Yet what should be an overriding theme fades into the background as Gunther (and a girlfriend he almost casually picks up during an investigation) heads to Prague for a meeting with manic arch murderer Reinhard Heydrich, the brains and drive behind the Holocaust. Gunther's stint amid the luxurious surrounds and the endless food/drink is quickly spoiled when one of the participants is found dead and he is told to find the killer. The challenge when writing about the era of the Naxis and their crimes is that you need to find the right language to describe their depravity and instead here we see a crafty Heydrich with little idea of what makes him tick. Gunther's new girlfriend has a shady past which comes out at the end, rather jarringly, I must say. Personally, I found Gunther a bit too cynical and cold for my liking and must say he didn't really engage me. That said, I realise there are many other earlier works which feature him, and perhaps I caught the series on an off day. Prague Fatale certainly did its task (get me through a nine-hour plane journey) but it won't stick in the mind for long.
0792844882|5.0|A very good movie I enjoyed it alot every time I watch it and that has been more than four time so far
0316069434|5.0|Michael Connelly scores another hit with The Black Box.  The book opens up with a murder during the LA riots and then moves 20 years later to Harry Bosch being assigned the file as a cold case.  The book starts to pick up a rhythm and moves at a break neck  pace.  Connelly makes the connections among the various characters involved in the killing and the usual intrigue of interoffice politics at break neck speed.  I read the book in 2 sittings and was sorry to see it end.  Good job Mr. Connelly.
0547884591|5.0|Enjoyable to read and packed with enjoyable facts and details. Not just a cook book; but a personal navigation tool!
B000YI7MRM|5.0|I have not read the books - but I really enjoyed this movie, it is classy and very well executed.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Cheesy acting, a lot of big names, awesome 80's music and wardrobe...LOVE it!  I've watched it over and over again.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The game is a great distraction when waiting in line or just wanting to relax.  It is a little harder, but that is what keeps my interest.  A great deal since it was free.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Very good series so far. Each episode left me wanting more and continued onto the next one as soon as the credits rolled.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I enjoyed reading this coming of age story.  A good twist to the novel is that it is told through letters from the main character.  It does address mature themes so caution should used when recommending to teens but overall the story is memorable for great characters and honest stories.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It's Twilight and Harry Potter combined and I loved every second of it! The characters are amazing and you can really relate to them.
B000X107GI|4.0|I use them in a baseball hat bill flashlight unit and although I don't use it a lot these seem to hold up well.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|great writer who pulls you into the story.  Intriguing to me,  interesting to me, the way you know seeming unrelated pieces will come together.  Mysteries explained but can you second guess the master and figuer out how they fit together?
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This is one of those fun, mindless type movies that just entertains.  Each of the actors gave good performances and I really enjoyed the singing and song choices.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love my camera all the features that it has I still haven't tried them all looking forward to that
B006OOHYIC|5.0|These are enjoyable and challenging, I am having fun figuring the puzzles out.  I Mostly use Quell to relax, but I can too easily get caught up :-).
B000K15VSA|5.0|It came quick ond on time. It was a used item that said like new and they were correct. Perfect
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I had a sleeping baby in another room and the sound was so poorly mixed that I had to turn it down when the sound effects kicked in and then couldn't hear the dialogue.  The blasting of the sound effects did nothing for me but cause me to have to turn it off because it was unwatchable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I thought it would suck but it blew up in my face wow that was awesome I now have a whole castle.battling creeper and zombies but add redefine please.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|You just can't go wrong.  A master at work and enjoying it.  Good instrumental accompaniment. A well put together enjoyable effort.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is awesome fun i cant put it down even people in my home who watch me play are taken by the graphics and strategy involved
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Greetings & Salutations! This rather unusual film that combines science-fiction and the cowboy-western adds a touch of gallows humour without the obilgatory love scenes  that cause the viewer to go to the concession stand for more popcorn or at home on DVD sending one to the firdge for another six-pack and fried pork rinds or chips and dip!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game. My whole family is now playing it and we have so much fun competing against one another. I recommend this game to everyone.
B005CRPB0U|4.0|This book caught my eye because of the fact it is mentioned repeatedly in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />It is a quick read suitable for bedtime reading for children.<br /><br />Also since at least some of the proceeds from this book are going to charity it is a worthy buy for any fan of the Harry Potter series.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first half was pretty uneventful. The second half really pulled you in, just in time or I would have put it down for good. This is my second book by Flynn and was good. MAYBE if it wasn't so highly rated I would've expected a bit less and enjoyed it a little more. VERY twisted not to mention made my stomach turn more than a few times.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I ready to read the next two...  I may have to wait a few days to recover.  Soon enough though.
0375842209|5.0|I read the 'Book Theif' within a week or two because it was so intresting and i had trouble putting it down. The story was very touching and educational. I can reassuringly say it is one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it.
1439127700|5.0|She has been relating stories from the book about how all the ex-presidents tend to work together as a small fraternity, except Reagan.  Living in DC we see a lot of what goes on in politics but this presents a lot of new material that doesn't break into the open very often.  The book sounds fascinating and I will read it when she is through.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Great x 100 it made me smarter and I dint read the whole book Damon y'all ask to much hoe s
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The details in the book help tell the story much better than on screen. It makes everything very cohesive. On to the second Book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book<br />  Couldn't'<br />  Put it down. Getting next book now. Love how she loves two different people  who are completely different.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|The game itself was ok, but the tiles all looked so similar that it was hard to see the matches.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This book was a complete waste of my time and money. It's all over the place and unclear which tricks you into reading on.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|My daughters ( 3 yr and 5 yr old) like playing Pudding Monsters. Its pretty entertaining. I would recommend this game for sure. Thanks Amazon.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a fun game. I like killing zombies with samurai swords and the allies a fun to deploy. It could be better with a different view.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Exactly what I wanted- Just the three movies in Bluray. Actually comes with hours of behind-the-scenes content on separate discs, which is nice.
B002APS61I|5.0|Great story - It's faithful to Jane Austen and it appears they (film's producers) spared no expense to tell  this story.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|This one is cute but for my 3 and 5 year old its kind of difficult to figure out. Its probably okay for an older kid or if you sit by your child and help out.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I that this is a really good book to find almost all words that you want to find. I almost told the whole words all about this amazing book. I think it is the bed t dictionary every.... trust me for real
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great Heart-warming Read.I Loved the charachters and I loved the dog even more. It was interesting to read from a dog's point of view.
1599290634|5.0|I've bought Spectrum every year since the first one (but missed two), when I met some of the people behind the book at a convention.  The goal of each Spectrum collection is a noble one:  to showcase the year's most creative works, across various fields and media, in the pop culture areas of science fiction and fantasy.  This means that every Spectrum volume is a compendium of works ranging from sculptures (and in this one a functioning bronze cannon), paintings, design sketches, illustrations and more--some real, some digital, some a combination of both.  Comic art is interwoven with book covers, Magic (the Gathering) card art, game design art, and more.  Each year highlights one artist in particular, talks about the industry as a whole, and there's even a section devoted to works that went unpublished.  I liked seeing art from names as famous as Michael Whelan, James Gurney and Julie Bell, but then I also enjoyed some names I'd never heard of.<br /><br />Spectrum 19 isn't perfect:  although they work really hard to clearly and colorfully print every work I spotted a couple that were surprisingly out of focus.  Because many of these works were commissioned for a purpose, such as a book cover or an illustration, they tend towards the 'graphic arts' more than 'fine arts'--figures placed front and center, backgrounds sometimes de-emphasized, digital processing at times a bit lurid.  However, looking through these books is magical.  There is so much imagination, and so many diffent ways these artists present their creativity, that I can't help but enjoy each year's new volume.  For creative people, this is a fun journey through others' imaginations.
1451695195|5.0|A very well written book that is clearly causing some controversy in the medical field.  After all, as a neurosurgeon, Dr. Alexander would have a far better grasp on how the brain works, especially under the dire circumstances that he found himself, than the average lay person and he is not so easily dismissed.<br /><br />My impression is that for all his years of academic research, study and practice, he struggled to describe exactly what he experienced as there are no sufficient words that could do it justice.  The fact that on his return to this life, he looked closely at other possible scenarios as to what could have caused such an experience, shows that he was not quick to jump on the NDE bandwagon as some have asserted, but rather wanted to make sure that there was really no other materialist explanation that made any sense.<br /><br />I've read several of the critics comments who demand that he provide 'proof' that he had this experience while in a deep coma as they insist that he had it while on the road to recovery.  Of course, they cannot prove that either but expect everyone to accept their view without question.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is the title.  While I believe his account is very strong evidence that something does indeed survive the physical death, it is not 100% proof, at least by human standards.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0525951652|5.0|This book was wonderful and kept your interest on every page.<br />I would recommend it to anyone interested in history with a<br />wonderful story and follow up with Winter of the World by Ken<br />Follett.
1451629184|4.0|I couldn't put this book down and finished it in one night.  Jaycee is indeed a strong and remarkable person to have survived what she did.  Kudos to her for starting her foundation to help victims.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great book.  Once I read this I had to read the others in the Old Man's War series.  I've been recommending it to friends.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Our heroine, Katness, continues her transformation from huntress extraordinaire, to the face of a revolution.  The problem?  What's are the values that drive her?  Core beliefs?  For the revolution?  I found them wanting.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|she is a great writer and character builder.  a page turner.  she makes you want to go out and look at architecture. by
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is constantly coming up with new and interesting forms of magic.  The emperor's soul is no exception.  I'd read a sequel.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A love story, a mystery. A daughter who's mother is in the final stage of life needs to solve her secret. I enjoyed all of the characters especially Laurel. But the twist and turns were a blast! Thank you for the great story.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|It took me a bit to start watching the show, but consider me hooked. The biggest appeal to me is the music, and this soundtrack confirms that.<br /><br />Good stuff.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|this is the best series ever and this set is perfect. I would buy this for everyone i know if I knew they liked BBC series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo blitz the only thing I don't like it takes too long to level up. P keep giving the same shadow cards that you already have they need to make it to that it is easier to win the hard to get thank you.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Very durable. Better than one a friend bought for a higher price. Would be fun to get again in a different color.
B008BUK0XI|4.0|I love this movie. But the DVD was used and had a lot of scratches which made the movie stall.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This was given as a gift.  The person loves this show.  They were very pleased with this set.  Will buy season 8 when it comes out.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|To me, this is the best so far of the Pendergast series. Full of surprises as always. And Pendergast himself is more fallible and emotionally vulnerable than he has seemed in past books. He's still a superman and a more likeable one. A very, very enjoyable read.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|Chose to watch because it was free and went into it with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Mildly funny with some good moments, not a great story line but very decent with ironic twists. In my opinion, worth the watch.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a great movie for kids of all ages.  My kids from 3-11 love watching it over and over.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A miraculous tale told expertly.  I enjoyed the story immensely from the ponderings of religion, to the survival at sea, and then the psychological twist at the end interspersed with much wisdom and humor.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|my boy was long overdue for sniper cover and with this and the orange mod werks massacre kit this can reach out and tag enemy's over 100ft out. in the great nerf war of 2013 our our tactical sniper team will reign victorious.
0525952926|4.0|You've got to love a book that gives you a history lesson without seeming like a text book. I'm not sure that I liked it as well as the first book in the trilogy, but it was a great read nonetheless. Looking forward to book three!
0812984412|5.0|After seeing Cloud Atlas in the theater, I had to read the book. The movie was wonderful, but left many questions - especially in the sections where characters spoke a sort of pidgin English. I needed to understand the characters better and the worlds they inhabited.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas (the book) did not disappoint.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas weaves together stories from many continents and many centuries. A 19th-century American lawyer suffering from a mysterious malady on a cargo ship befriends a New Zealand stowaway; a serving clone breaks free from her bondage in a future corporation-ruled Korea and joins the rebellion; a young, brilliant homosexual musician in 1920s England becomes an amanuensis for a doddering composer; a nuclear engineer and a tabloid journalist in 1970s San Francisco try to publicize the plant's dangers; a ne'er-do-well publisher on the run from creditors in the 2000s is locked into a home for the aged by his vengeful brother; a savage tribe in a distant future helps a hyper-technical group of humans find some critical lost information. The stories are linked by objects (a manuscript or a packet of letters), or stories known across time, or (evidently) by characters who exist across centuries.<br /><br />Author David Mitchell has a rare ability to speak in the voices of people from many walks of life and in many ages -- from the pious erudition of a 19th century educated American lawyer to the growling bark of a savage survivor of a post-apocalyptic scrounger. His depiction of a corporation-dominated future, where slave-workers are cloned for efficiency, was frightening and plausible. Mitchell is also tuned in to the inner workings and prejudices of the artistic mind. For example, Robert Frobisher, his young composer, thinks in terms of music and has a deep knowledge of European composers and the works. He and his mentor, Vivian Ayers, duel sarcastically in musical terms that I could not follow, but enjoyed immensely.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas does not drum its reincarnation them into you like the movie did. Aside from the existence of a birthmark on certain characters, you could miss the theme entirely, without missing out on the message that we are connected to each other over time. A beautifully engrossing work with mysteries and depths, revenge, treachery and unexpected assists on every page. Brilliantly written and conceived.does not drum its reincarnation them into you like the movie did.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|This product seems to be a knockoff. Even though it came packaged as new, once opened the quality did not compare to other's who have the same product.  The plastic screen did not lay flat on the phone. It had a slight wave in it as well as a slightly different color than the one I bought a Best Buy.  Also a piece broke off in the first day.  Other's I know bought this item and had the same comments.
030759565X|5.0|I am a huge fan of the blog and got the cookbook for 3 people for Christmas, luckily someone gave me a copy as well! Great recipes, great pictures, great wit - exactly what you'd expect from the Smitten Kitchen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it!(: when I play I play and play and play. I fun game and I love being able to play many games in this one game!!
0739378341|5.0|Hubby loves Grisham as do I.  Hubby has some eye problems so when I can get a Grisham in large print I jump on it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Second time reading this book, and i can honestly say i LOVED it. Every second of it. It's a joy to read and keeps me wanting more.
0547569653|5.0|I had read &#34;Born to Run&#34; couldn't wait to get my hands on Scott Jurek's book. It was great. Definite for health conscience runners.
B008220D5K|5.0|I don't know what other reviewers are talking about. I went to see this movie on Christmas day and I thought it was hysterical. I laughed and had tears rolling down my cheeks through almost the entire movie. I love this movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|provides hrs of entertainment. just when you think you have the puzzle solved....wrong you have to rethink stratagy fun family game
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Is there anything better then this show? I don't think so. The cast,the crew,the way they dress. A plus plus.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|If you loved the Pollyanna story this is a nice sequel of her life soon after the first book and then several years later when she is a young adult.  You see how the &#34;Glad Game&#34; works differently in her later years.
B005CAATXG|4.0|Based on visuals only Icon For Hire gives off a very pop radio band feel. Bright colors, attractive singer, strange dude with a mohawk to try and give rock cred, and the scene of her getting dolled up. It all screams 'MANUFACTURED!!'<br /><br />At points things sound a bit pop oriented, sure, but for the most part I was extremely impressed. Ariel has a robust powerful voice and the band offers up some pounding beats to support her nicely. There is one very obvious influence you can hear throughout the CD, Paramore. Well, All We Know/Riot-era Paramore.<br /><br />The album starts out on a heavy note with Overture acting as a perfect opener for Theatre. The Grey is a powerful ballad that erupts into a climactic bridge/chorus/ending. Iodine is a chorus driven singalong with your average radio fare. Fight is a very uptempo 'get up' anthem, and Up In Flames is another chorus heavy tune the has a nice riff offered throughout.<br /><br />All in all, Scripted, if given an opportunity, is sure to grow on you and give you a new band to pay attention to. Icon For Hire has a lot of potential if they realize it. Recommended for fans of Paramore or fans of bands with female singers. g
B000FP2OPY|5.0|great service and value<br />,i've bought a number of items always beea a great choice so far ,i  'll keep looking here first
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I watched the series on PBS.  Absolutely loved it.  It is a soap opera set in England in the early 1900s.  Wonderful cast of characters you will come to love and hate.
B008PNBU30|3.0|Three Days Grace, for me, have always been underachievers. Their sole record that was great front to back was their debut. Since then it's been a string of 'meh', save for One-X. One-X is the only record that has surpassed mediocrity since their debut. That's the reason I was so hopeful for Transit Of Venus prior to its release after hearing their first single, Chalk Outline.<br /><br />Chalk Outline's sound is so far removed from their other albums, I thought this would be TDG's redemption...of sorts.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Same ol' Three Days Grace. Offer up hope of something new and interesting but deliver something uninspired and shallow. I suppose it's my fault for getting my hopes up for a band who gained fame from a song entitled \\"I Hate Everything About You.\\" To expect especially deep lyrical content from someone who wrote that might be asking a bit much. But! Never Too Late, One-X, and World So Cold were so amazing! Anyways....<br /><br />Lets look at the good songs shall we? I won't take that away from them, they always give us a few great tunes. Chalk Outline, The High Road, Anonymous, Give In To Me, and Give Me A Reason. All those are grade-A TDG songs. Each has a lot of power, great riffs, and mice vocals. Past that I was left extremely unimpressed. Songs ran together, beats got boring and tame, and the vocals just started getting on my nerves.<br /><br />By the end of this CD I was wondering how they could have possibly thought this was worth putting out. It sounds like a cash in to me. However, the songs that are good are very good, I'll admit that. They are capable of making good songs for sure. Is the CD worth buying though? I can't condone paying full price at all, it is a good bargain bin purchase though. g
B003O86FMW|4.0|Well written,end came a little quick. Looking forward to reading the last book. My granddaughter loved it and so do I! Not quite the fun of the first book but still good.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have seen many versions of A Christmas Carol on TV but had never read the book until lately.  It is a wonderful book.  The language is very descriptive.  No wonder it became a classic.
B008TRUDAS|1.0|This book started out pretty good, but then the story line was so ridiculous I was annoyed while reading it.  I felt like I was reading about people with a very low IQ.  The things they said and the way they acted were simply stupid.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Great movie with great affects. A tad on the bloody side with all the &#34;shoot em up&#34; going on but the action and level of cool from Christian kept my interest.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this when I was a young girl and reread it again recently.  It is a good story of &#34;Little Women&#34; coming of age. It will hold the interest of young and old alike.
0785163174|1.0|Where to start?  Marvel really needs to completely reboot again and start from scratch because NOTHING is consistent or makes sense in the Marvel continuum.  The Avengers somehow are able to go toe-to-toe with a cosmic entity that devours entire worlds and stars in seconds - that should give you a clue as to how much readers are required to suspend disbelief in this ridiculous series.  I could go on for pages with all the inconsistencies, which were equally idiotic.<br /><br />My biggest gripe was how poorly captain america and the avengers were written, making them incredibly unlikable.  In a nutshell, mutants were persecuted, hunted and killed by everyone including the US government and terrorists from the future (Second Coming) who were seeking to kill Hope and destroy all mutant-kind, and the Avengers did nothing to help.  Now that they need Hope, the Avengers come in force demanding that the X-men hand her over.  Ignoring the persecuted minority when they needed help and then bullying them when they didn't cave in to their threats.  To me, there was no tension or balance in the story - I just found CA and the Avengers annoying and sanctimonious, and I don't think that's how Marvel wants readers to feel about their new flagship supergroup.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I played this on a friend's iPod touch once and loved it, I know have purchased it on my kindle. Though it's very fun and also hard and challenging, I do run into annoying problems, such as Iceland and Greenland not being infected when I have all upgrades for cold weather, high infection, and even I have already done so, they just stay at 3 or 6 when I do it. Also, a dlc should not be more than the game itself, the games a dollar, so why is the neural worm 3 dollars? Either way, great and fun game, can't wait to see the other dlcs.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|If you're looking for a youtube downloader this app does the trick and does it fast. I was very pleased! I do recommend it.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|Always love anything that is Harry Potter related; have all other DVD's and the books too; including the &#34;Beddle Bard&#34; for my nephew in Ohio
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend. I had a hard time getting into the book, as it jumped back and forth every chapter. My friend said to stick with it, it was worth it, so I did and really enjoyed the book. I am not a fan of the use of foreign language without an explanation in English so I skimmed over those words, but still seemed to make sense.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great gifts. my friends loved the music.  Can't go wrong with Rod Stewart.  I should have bought more for other people
B008IYR2BA|5.0|As a fan of this series, season 6 did not disappoint!  The product arrived in a timely manner and was all I hoped it would be.  The last episode is a &#34;cliff hanger&#34; and I have already pre-ordered Season 7...I highly recommend this to all &#34;Dexter&#34; fans.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I wanted something for my Kindle like the &#34;Post It&#34;s I use on my desktop.  These work great to make quick notes while using Kindle!
B00407PNY2|5.0|Dad's Favorite Movie! Classic movie with classic cars and classic realistic chase scenes. Nice to have the movie now on DVD.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters with my friend on vacation, then took my kids to see it when I got home. We bought it when it was released and have watched it 3 times already. I always enjoy the music, Rebel Wilson is a scene stealer, and I notice something new each time I see it.
B009MO57H6|4.0|I'm beginning to think this movie series based on the game has entered a continous loop. If you're a fan you'll remember that Alice &#34;gained&#34; her extra powers due to being infected with the T-Virus, then lost them in the last movie to the evil head of Umbella. Consider that when you watch this film.  There's loads of action and if your a Resident Evil movie fan some interesting uses of some of the former characters from the pass movies. Get ready for a very interesting ending that seems somehow new and at the same time leaves you asking &#34;Where have we seen this before.&#34; I liked it and feel it's a good buy.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Ken Follett never disappoints.His characters are believable and his story is etched in history.Compared to other fiction writers this would be 5 stars.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|From the moment I started this book I was so happy to know that I would be catching up with Jack, Dom and all the other familiar characters whom I have grown so fond of over the last couple Tom Clancy novels.  Non- stop action, sinister plots and all the action I know and crave from the author.  Such big books, but still so readable.
B00070DK46|3.0|Despite the cover being torn I am happy with the record. I never see it used in the records shops and the reissue price is hefty. amazon is an addiction the local shops can't always fill. I like to frequent both.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like this game a lot, but I wish there was an easier way to get the red gems. Just sayin'.
0307887448|5.0|well written, shockingly original plot. I have bought this book for two of my friends and they both enjoyed it immensely.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|It took probably 10 minutes to understand the gameplay but afterwards I spent an hour playing the game. There were a few defects I noticed during loading screens and it could just be compatability issues but nothing that affected in game play. HTC DNA
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Wish there were more Easy songs, even if they dumbed down the notes.  I am not sure if these are the accurate notes or not, but it was fun to play.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Of all solitaire games out there I love spider solitaire the best. Now with this Amazon app on my tablet I can enjoy it every day
B009LY72LQ|5.0|My daughter loves to interchange all the parts!  She has many sets and loves them all!  Definitely a good buy!
B009TZBEKW|2.0|I liked the upbeat, bring you to your feet bob along, groove-along in your car if that's where you are, in front of the speaker as well as wearing them across your scalp and steppin that was 'I Created Disco' and 'Ready for the Weekend'.  '18 Months' is what, the last 18 months of pop music getting a remix? The later tracks of both this performer's previous albums have all been the best of those records. 'Acceptable in the 80's' as well as the title, although the most popular and the one's that shot up the British charts, aren't so; there's better stuff mixed in and are standouts. The Florence and the Mo'cheen resonant 'Sweet Nothing', and oh how so, Florence Welch guests outside her metal enclosure; a hellish cyborg-mesh contraption that has drilled into her ginger-skull feeding her amplified sound that is the MACHINE. Again, another standout late track on the album. Only this time not enough gems to salvage. The first 4 or 5 tracks are especially horrendous.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love the up.  Better than Exchange or phone email access.  Love the look and the clear style.  Nice to have Yahoo! email all by itself.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I like super hero movies and the combination of all of the ones involved made it a good movie. I could have done without the flying fish like creatures but it was still good regardless.
B008G59IBI|4.0|Very fast pace CD, more rock/jazz mix then the first two, but all 3 were well worth the money. This band shows alot of talent in many fields of music on these CD'S
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great app for its price. Takes photos and videos. Easy to use. Easy to share. Only annoying thing about this app is after every picture it closes the camera. Other than that I have no complaints. Wish they would have thought about just putting an app on the Kindle Fire HD to begin with but oh well. I still love my Kindle Fire. No complaints here.
0894803123|5.0|We've made a couple recipies so far. It is the best ice cream I've ever had and so easy! Happy to say we will never have to buy ice cream again!!
B007MAETA8|5.0|....and it's a very, very good one ! So much so, i've ordered the rest of his albums.<br />This has to be one of the best releases of 2012. A mature chilled out album,  that holds your attention all the way through & never feels boring. Lyricly, conjours up all kinds of images, good story telling. Superb muscisianship, very well produced & mixed.<br />Musical style similar all the way through, but that's not detrimental at all, when artists / albums try to be too diverse, they can become disjointed. Mr Mayer's latest release is like a complete piece of art.<br />Very highly recommended. I look forward to hearing his other releases.<br /><br />( That's good timing ! Battle Studies, just arrived in post...already spinning ! )
B009MCRHH6|5.0|My kids had it for their Wii years ago and when I found it I was excited. Challenging puzzles and cute story line. Very addicting. Bought it and beat it within days but I still play it!! Totally worth the download.
B00122KW0I|5.0|some of the best movie music ever written, the Complete LOR Return of the King soundtrack includes &#34;Houses of Healing,&#34; a beautiful song sung by Liv Tyler (Arwen) that is not available elsewhere.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Watched the entire 1st and 2nd season while in bed with Pneumonia. Cannot wait for next episode starting again I. jan 2013.  I am hooked!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Can't live without it. On my comp. Phone. And now Kindle. Don't know why I need so many ways to keep staying on but I do and continue to do so. Its just facebook ppl. It works. Pictures are clear. Pretty much looks like it does on the computer.
B0000029AL|5.0|I love 70's and 80's music and this is just another collection that has been added to my arsonal YAY!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book deserves more that 5 stars! It deserves a sky full of stars! It is an amazing beautiful heartfelt book with amazing and beautiful characters. You will laugh, cry and loose your breath! Colleen Hoover has once again proven just how wonderful her writing is!
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|Thought it would be great for boredom and for the kids but turns out that on the Kindle Fire HD the turn arrows on the screen line up perfectly with the menu button. Gets in the way. Only played it a couple of times. More frustrating than anything.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|For the most part, it was exciting. I think they took some liberties with Reachers deductive reasoning but overall a good read
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great unless you don't like using you mind because then you will never get anywhere in this game you would think it was a total game that is terrible but since I like using my mind I only got this game the day after Christmas and I'm already on level 7. GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book is ok I like the movie better. But I like it because you only hear about the kids killing each other you don't see it.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I read the book John Carter of Mars when I was a teen ager in the 70's.  I always hoped they would make a movie some day.  The visual effects were great.  The story was fantastic.  I hope they make a sequel.  There were several books in the series.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I absolutely love how they have intertwined all the story book characters. I was hesitant at first, but glad i started watching it.
B000AM2L1O|4.0|My duaghter loves her new doll, but I was a little surprised to find that the doll has been scented. It is a fairly mild baby powder scent, but I would have preferred if it didn't smell. I guess other dolls (melissa & doug dolls) have a stronger scent, so between the two, I would still choose this doll.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|not sure how related to previous movies<br />looks like just a shooting game<br />weak scenes same old monsters<br />i am a fan of RE but this was crap
B0023SDPS6|4.0|My first experience with Craig Johnson and I will definitely read other books written by him.  The story kept me wondering right up until the end.  His command of the English is excellent in my view and I loved his descriptions all along the way.<br />Very good book.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great radio experience.  Love that you can enjoy world wide music.  Very easy to acquire. Enjoy the experience and expand your horizons.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Purchased as a gift for someone. I'm sure it was good. It was gifted per request for a Christmas gift.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Rarely do I find an album worth buying these days, but Muse never fails to impress me. This album is absolutely fantastic. If you like Muse, or good music, then get this. If you prefer crappy boy bands and Lady Gag-Gag, then this isn't for you because this is actually good.
1442359315|5.0|I knew from the subject and a sample from the book it could be helpful to Karen, my daughter.  She is in the process of reading it and is getting positive feedback from the doctor's experiences in this area. Her co-live-in partner Michael called me to express his total appreciation and feelings about the book as being how he feels himself which are documented in this book.  It is a big success for having bought this book for them, with the thought that it could help anyone.
B000RLKXEK|4.0|A very enjoyable film with plot twists, and turns. I purchased this video to add to my movie collection, because it can watched over, and over and still be entertained.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I originally downloaded this for my grandsons, but I am now hooked on it. It is a fun adaptation of Angry Birds.
B004IHE2B4|5.0|Went together really easily, If you want to build a huge track by at least 3 boxes. 10/10 would buy again
0345803485|4.0|No problem with the shipping time or the condition of the book. Book is not really my cup of tea, it's a grown-up fantasy world that I can not relate to.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book presents an amazing story with so many layers of interpretation that readers of all ages can take something away with them. The insight into how humans survive is engrossing and there is a deeply religious dimension throughout the entire novel. It left me with many questions but also a sense of knowledge about humanity. A cleverly constructed and engaging story, one that I will always remember.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child are my favorite authors however their latest books (the Gideon series) are not up to their usual writing standards. I almost didn't read Two Graves but I am really glad I did. Two Graves grabs the reader during the first chapter and doesn't let go. Pendergast does some amazing feats albeit a little far fetched but it all adds up to a good read. If you are a fan of the &#34;boys&#34;, do read this book. If you've never read them give them a try (but stay away from the Gideon series or you'll be sorely disappointed.)
B005EGXTEE|3.0|Was looking forward to eading this, and then progressing to the other 2 in the trilogy, but having read this, will not bother with the sequels. Maybe it is my age, and sex but found the story and writing a little juvenile, and definitely geared for a younger  ( early &#62; mid teens  female reader/s.  Disappointing
B004TSKKE0|4.0|I like this book because it describes drug use and its effects from a large range of situations. It is filled with humour and instead of the usual adjectives or adverbs it describes persons and activities in a way that would be many a marketing student's envy. In many parts the book is super intelligently hilarious, albeit sad. I did not choose &#34;I love it&#34; because it often overly describes the environment, setting or surroundings.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Love Jack Reacher!!!!  Didn't want to put it down.  Love the mix of mystery, and military.  On my sixth Reacher novel now!!!!!
B001IF252M|5.0|When you buy used Mac's on line they don't always come with all the goodies that you<br />get when purchased new. This is a must for connecting to many portable projectors.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Such a good series, I'm sorry to see it end I wish it didn't have to but the story is well written and conclusive.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|The movie was great as usual.  Can not go wrong with Jane Austen and all of her books and movies
1426308469|5.0|I bought this book for my 5 year old grandson along with some jumbo plastic dinosaurs.  He loves reading the book and then acting out what he read with the dinosaurs.  Definitely would recommend for children.  It's a fun book with great pictures - nothing gory or scary.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book. The characters were well developed. The suspense part was as good as the romance part. It made me want to watc the movie.
B006VREHRS|1.0|The first season of Boardwalk will not play on my computer. I have other shows in my library that play just fine. very frustrating.
0395389496|5.0|We actually wore our first copy out and had to purchase another one.  This is a must have during the holiday season!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Are big fans and really loved this on blue ray. Well worth the cost for the gift set which has a great book as well.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|A bit stupid, but if you are up for simple dumb humor  then its a decent movie.  It had some moments of greatness, but overall I can only give it 3 stars.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|20 words? ok. this movie is like an painting. lynch paints using moods, emotions, colors, and always utterly unpredictable, unexpected riddles of dialogue. try to figure it out. it absolutely makes total sense, but no one else who ever lived expresses themselves in this way.<br /><br />this film and blade runner are the 2 greatest films ever made.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read. Could not put it down. The story was incredible and I recommend this book to anyone. It was amazing.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I've seen all the Resident Evil movies out there and to be honest this one was not the greatest. I feel like these movies are an acquired taste so not everyone likes them but for the most part they were all enjoyable. This one didn't feel the same as the others but considering I just like the Resident Evil movies I'm okay with it. If you like post apocalyptic movies and or zombies then might as well watch it. If you like any of the other Resident Evil movies you might as well watch it. If you're bored you might as well watch it. Other than that I guess you're okay to not watch it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This book was awesome, restored my faith in the character.  Can't wait to see the next chapter in Mitch Rapp's journey.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|graphics are great but I was constantly asked to give a review.  I hadn't even finished yet.  When the game is good we want others to play too!  We will give reviews!
B005RUV0NY|5.0|I don't now what it is about post apocalyptic + zombies but It's just gosh darn entertaining! This show has great characters and you never know who's going to die. That's exciting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great. no freeze/close issues. love that it remembers your work and shows you each step if you want. i use this to keep the balance in my checking account now. just awesome!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think that should make more games like this I love the game play every thing about the game is 5 stars,I just love this game.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Well, it's probably just me, but I had a lot of difficulty downloading this. (Since it probably is just a problem with my internet connection, Don't put much stock in that.) Otherwise it was a little lackluster compared to the previous books, it felt like in general there was less meat to the story. Still very amusing and sounds like a real middle schooler.<br /> Also, it seems to ignore its continuity at times--it's still introducing new characters and old ones seem to be disappearing, like Chirag Gupta and Holly Hills--actually, every girl that featured in a previous book is missing, which is weird especially because the whole plot is about Greg trying have a relationship  with a girl.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome read!!!  Very well written.  I couldn't put it down.  Would definately recommend this book. . . . . .
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun to play. use a stylist makes it easier. sometimes the card goes differently. then what you wanted. again fun to play.
B002VECM72|5.0|I love true stories, and I especially enjoy stories with a positive, redeeming storyline.  This film accomplishes both.  The true story of Michael Oher and the family who adopted him is an inspiring true story, with tons of heart.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Unbelievable acting and intense, anxiety-producing (in a good I-can't-stop-watching-and-can't-wait-for-next-episode-way) drama. Extremely well-written storyline with super character development. Amazing! Can't wait to see how Season 2 unfolds.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It came within two days of ordering it on line.  It was gift for Christmas and exactly what the recipient wanted.  Thanks.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|better the movie  1 great action, stars everywhere. love it.very glad I bought the movie,that way I can watch it over and over
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|This soundtrack is the best piece of evidence in the feud between Broadway and Hollywood. Every performance on this cd is subpar. I don't care if the actors were &#34;brave&#34; or if the film making was &#34;revolutionary,&#34; choosing to leave the vocals natural using untrained actors was the wrong choice and the music on this soundtrack is barely listenable. I hate the fact that our society uses autotune so frequently, but if you insist on untrained voices you really can't leave them raw like this. If you're a lover of the original recordings from the West End and Broadway you will regret buying this album.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Looper is definitely worth watching at least once.  The time travel premise is just a backdrop for an interesting story that keeps you guessing.  I'd watch it again.
B001DJ69E8|5.0|This genre of music is like nothing else I've ever heard - mind blowing.... amazing.........epic..... It's an absolute must have in your CD collection.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Once again a brilliant Sanderson book. The magic is innovative, and the story full of depth of character. Hopefully the start of another great series, although there is no doubt that his other series (like The Way of Kings!) need to be continued first!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I just started playing this after so many people kept saying it was such a great game.<br />needless to say it is an awesome game! It works GREAT on my kindle fire and there are so many levels to play!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think it's a great book and its a vivid story it's the best book I've read in my life.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|i enjoyed this book. the story built nicely and kept you thinkung you had it figured out, but then took a turn in a different direction.
B005HSL626|5.0|I had this app on my android mytouch. I downloaded it on my Kindle fire and it works great!<br />there are a bunch new features the game on my mytouch didnt have. LOVE IT!
B009D0LBRO|4.0|The graphics are beautiful and the game is just enough both easy and a challenge to keep it fun.<br />I have never heard of a 'running' game as a genre, and I couldn't understand (still don't) why Ray can't go backwards. But knowing it is a genre characteristic helps a lot.<br />All that said it is an awesome game I highly recommend.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I certainly liked it.... I guess the only thing that is so very frustrating to me and most surely the point of the novel, is the destruction of all involved in this story.  The love is not love at all but total obsession and selfishness.  Its a cautionary tale.  I used to think it was supposed to be romantic, but after reading it and also seeing the BBC version of Wuthering Heights I am convinced that Emily Bronte thought to diadactically show the writer that what some call love is no LOVE at all.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|Hey let's take an interesting idea and try to make a book out of it.<br /><br />This seems to be the habitual thing to do in American non-fiction writing (pun intended).<br /><br />Let me summarize it for you:<br /><br />Habit: Cue. Routine. Reward.<br /><br />Now think about all kind of interesting stories to convey the same idea. Book = done.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|have uninstalled and reinstalled multiplt times. cant connect to Internet and locks up. not worth it! will not download it again. moving on to a different game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was angry she had to go back through the games... WHY?  Literally I was sick, I really did not want to go through that again.  It felt so unfair and I could not fathom what the author could do with this story.  It felt like 'ground hog day'  Yet I was drawn into the lives of the other players and It was actually very enjoyable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A little dark, but it caught my heart. I recommend it for anyone especially young adults. I couldn't stop reading. I'm defiantly reading all the books, (if not already read)  Bill (character) recommended.
B0079R8IYW|2.0|I ordered it thinking that it will be stable once I put stand up the Kindle Fire. But, unfortunately, it is not. It;s not easy to insert the cover to make the triagle that stands the Kindle. If you move it, it goes down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So very much loved this novel.  I usually go for romance, but this had romance enough for me.  This book made me want to analyze why I felt so emotionally attached to the love triangle. And why I was routing for one verses the other.  I felt like I really liked the purity of the love and the strength of his love for her.  He really seemed genuinely concerned with her safety and desired for her best.  Sacrificial Love is the best kind.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|great game. cute graphics. adorable animals. I am happy to let my 7 year old play this anytime. I would recommend this for sure.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It is a spellbinder. Full of suspense and makes the reader not want to put it down but continue reading late into the night.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|I loved learning about her plight and I am very interested about human character during this time period. Nazi Germany.
0060775858|2.0|Only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because I thought it was the small miniature version of the book, rather than a very large copy.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I do like this cd, but maybe my expectations were too high. I will confess I have not seen the movie yet, and I make like it better when I do. It may grow on me as I listen more. I have only listened a couple of times so far.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Not up to other  De Mille books. Easy to put down and read another book in beween .  Finally got interesting in the last few chapters. Do not know why I feel compelled to finish a book like this.
067144901X|5.0|Love Sandra Boynton. This book is another added to our collection. Super easy to read with bright colors and pictures, and kids love the sounds you make.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I have all of the Lord of the Rings soundtracks, so I wanted this one. I think this is the best so far.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This is an awesome calculator if I've ever seen one. It even does order of operations. If you are on the edge of whether or not to purchase this calculator, let my review push you over the edge into purchasing this app. Awesome!
0634021869|5.0|Actually, I sent this to my son and he loved it!  He isn't a BB King fan but loves Clapton.  He says the songs are great.
B0041KVZ18|5.0|okay, we all know how great the music is, so im just commenting on the quality. It is outstanding, so was my copy of Abbey Road. Sgt Peppers had some poppin' issues. Two out of 3 aint bad I guess. Cool packaging, with a poster I just hung on my wall , and 8 x 10 individual pictures of the boys - nice and glossy. Thumbs up
0064430227|5.0|Item was in perfect condition, and I am happy to add it to my collection for my future classroom once I become a teacher!
B0064W667Y|5.0|This is a great story. Will continue reading more in the series. Looking forward to more in the series. Amazing
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Wasn't for me. Was for a friend who's husband likes this artisit. Hope he liked it. We&#34;ll see when i get to work.
0763619612|5.0|Item was in perfect condition, and I am happy to add it to my collection for my future classroom once I become a teacher!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I loved this book as it actually reveals the demons of drug addiction, I do feel sorry for Anthony and the hard time he had, but am so happy he is clean once again.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Not a top notch blockbuster but still enjoyed the movie. It has some slow points but the over the top action scenes make up for that. If you're looking for historical accuracy you won't find it here. If you are just looking for a fun movie with plenty of action then this movie is for you.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Made me laugh and kept me going i can't wait to read some more from this author. A must read
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Best book I've read in a while; I couldn't seem to out it down. The worst part is that I can't read the next one yet!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This movie was excellent. Hilarious from beginning to end. I had high hopes for this movie just from the previews and this movie did not disappoint. Seth McFarlane may have had some UPS and downs with his productions but this was definitely worth watching more than once.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Just started this series. Love the character of Jack Reacher. There are some funny parts, scary parts, good mystery/story and of course kick *%$* action scenes.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This story was a great read! The characters were smart, and there were no infuriating misunderstandings just to drag the story out. Well put together and an entertaining read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was an amazing book.  It took me a while to get into. I stopped reading and then picked it up again.  Very clever and engaging right until the end.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My children love it! I do not see the attraction for it, but as long as they are enjoying the game, I love it!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This works great was not sure if it would wake me up in the  morning, I have  to say this is better then using my phone.I love using the bell's reminds me of when I lived in Italy and in Germany.
0374275637|5.0|This book is revolutionary.  I've read some other books on the psychology of decision-making, but this is by far the most complete and thorough.  I found it a page turner, but it might not be for everyone, if science/economics is not you're thing.  That said, it is a must read for anyone who is engaging in marketing, business, or investing, as it turns many major economic theories on their heads.  It certainly changed the way I think about the world.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I was very hesitant on reading this. Simply because I had heard what was told through the media and I figured if that was horrible what all this poor woman went through...her story which she is telling...had to be horrible. People say it's hard to follow and I believe if you're a true reader and enjoy reading you'll have no problem. I kept up just fine. And her story was remarkable. What a strong woman she was then and still is. The 2 that did this are horrid people and Jaycee put up with A LOT of bull and she's amazing. I love how she wrote this story with knowing it would be hard. But what a wonderful outlet. Amazing woman.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|It did not live up to what I thought it would be. It was lacking in anything that made it stand out other than  Colin Farrell.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Was a gift for my teenage grand-daughter. I watched it with her and it was very entertaining. I can see why she wanted this for her gift request.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|Well I think the book is good I think it's good for kids who are going to middle school next year like me and I was scared of it because people said it was a mean cruel place
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|just started on it but it is a quality game with great graphics.  I am digging on it. if the rest of the game is as cool as what I have played then I will definitely play more of this group's games.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Great story line and really funny. Will Ferrell is hysterical in this movie and really puts you in a great mood!
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Gave as a gift and from all appearances went over well.  Helped us use the Kinect in a small area
B0097HSS4M|4.0|The kindle fire does not take the best pictures (shocker, i know) so i was looking for some way to clean up and tune up pictures a bit.<br />This program does a wonderful job of tweaking my photos with colors warmth and saturation. the choices of effects give you some play room and edits to make those meme and happy cat pictures if you so desire.<br />my only complaint is that many times the pictures come out looking 'pixalated' and choppy, which i dont think is a fault of the photo editor but the resolution of the camera. Since i bought a book reader tablet and not a digital camera, well i think it works just fine.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Had to check this out. My granddaughter loves this movie and I can see why. Animation is wonderful and dialogue really good.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|coin dozer is a very addicting game but my coins do not regenerate fast enough for me to keep playing for a longer time period
0316174483|5.0|I bought this to use with my students ranging from pre-k to HS.. It's was the perfect way to create a personal project for my student teacher to say thank you for all her hard work during the semester.<br /><br />The designs were very easy to duplicate and fun for all ages. The trick is to have the correct amount of ink during the print of the finger. Let it dry completely before drawing on the surface.<br /><br />Had a blast learning how to draw too.. Not at all artistic.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE--- Was a very good movie, I thought it truly tapped into what real family's can be like
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cried... I laughed... I laughed & I cried again!! What an amazing story! I couldn't put it down... breath taking!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I show everyone my case and screen protector and they can't believe I don't have any bubbles on my screen, its the most flawless screen protector I've seen yet on anyone's phone. The screen protector is worth the price alone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hope AMC follows through with season beginning in February.  However, I hope they add more episodes than 10 or 12.  This is a very good show.  Moreover, if you don't like gory movies then this movie is not for you.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I'm wary of the Kindle apps but this one works fine. I don't know what else to review, it's fine.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can not wait to see how it ends!  The characters have become my own family. Don't hesitate to get this book
B0049VZ222|5.0|This is a very good series.  Glad I found this movie because today there is very little other than sports to watch on TV.  Great series.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is a great mix of search and find and puzzle solving games. It is a fun time wasting game that uses your brain.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the bible with me.  It is much lighter to carry the kindle than a heavy bible.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is one of the best movies we have seen.  The story about a colt who no one thinks will amount to anything vs a horse who is supposed to be the winner.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  And although it's not horror, I actually find it really scary too.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a well-written thriller.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|For a debut album, this one is solid. From the first track Radioactive, with its driving/aggressive electronic beat, to the final frustrated ballad Nothing Left To Say/Rocks, Night Visions flows like a well conducted symphony; rising and falling but always keeping interest. While most of the songs keep a fairly upbeat rhythm, the most common themes deal with death, darkness and destruction. One of my favorite songs off the album, Demons, has a beautiful, catchy melody yet deals with a person's internal struggles. But what I like most about this album is the difference between each song. Rather than having one monotonous style, each song is well crafted and can stand on its own.<br /><br />Overall, I have listened to this album many times over and still have it in my regular rotation.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We saw these guys on the Today Show and it was fun to see how much fun they had making the music together.  We thoroughly enjoy their CD and look forward to their next one.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is very helpful. It is easy to us and you get the weather very fast. I would tell everyone to download this app.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Not as good as the first movie but this movie ties up the loose ends of the first movie and it a great story also.<br /><br />Lots of action, intrigue, and classic sherlock holmes cockiness. With all the action, gunfire, and explosions, this was a must-buy blu-ray for me. Fantastic movie.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Any time i hit a picture off my feed i have to hit the back button a bunch of times for it to go back to my feed :/ please fix!
B0058BI896|5.0|My son loved this series. It's wonderful to hear such laughter from him - he watched the whole series in 2 days
1455522597|4.0|The first Nelson DeMille book I read was the Gatehouse which was such a treat I wanted to read more by this author. I finally found The Gold Coast which provided the background for the characters of this two book series. Next I got hooked on the John Corey Series right out of the gate with Plum Island. The side comments by ' John ' through out the series adds humor and personl touches that enhance the story line. Looking forward to book 7!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I loves it I can't wait to read the throne of fire. This book is kind of slow at first but picks up.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After seeing the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34;, I became interested to learn where the storyline came from.  This book is astounding, full of facts I did not know, and I would say is a MUST READ.  And while learning history, you'll also gleen a new vocabulary...but push thru!  Recommend reading this with your KIndle so that you can easily look up unfamiliar words because comprehension is meaning!!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Harlan Coben is one of my favorite writers.  This was a fast paced book with many twists to the story line and a very surprising ending.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|A good book but it left me confused at the end but the main story was excellent and the auther does no dissapoint
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Complete and utter crap. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. I wish I could flush this turd of a movie out of my memory.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've recently herd a lot about this book from friends and decided to read it. I felt the book was relatable because the narrator talked about a lot of things I remember thinking or feeling during my freshman year and through high school. I loved this book, and I'll most likely read it again.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is my backup alarm clock.  I got the free version and liked it so much, I bought this one.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I first got the free version, thinking all of it was free. When I found out it was not I got full game without hesitating. This is my favorite by far.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Simple story but so well written.  Several times I actually laughed out loud while I was reading it.  Love it.
B003O86FMW|1.0|Best series I have ever written in my entire life these book has changed my perspective of a new level of hunger .
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Color is fine.  Texture is nice.  Using it as a prop or stand - not so good.  Elastic band - works for me.
B003E88TKS|5.0|Outstanding movie explaining the reality of the moment you are either fired or have to do the deed  Great performances
B004GYY714|5.0|I am constantly amazed at what my kindle fire can do.  Listening to Coast to Coast AM when I can't sleep suits me just fine.  Love it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I loved the Avengers movies so wanted to own it, I don't own that many because I can't just keep seeing them again and again, but I enjoyed seeing this when I got it and I know it can hold it's own with subsequent viewings.  Worth getting just to see the Hulk pummel Loki, &#34;Puny god&#34;.
B0063IH60K|4.0|What else can you say, solitaire is solitaire.  This one is just fine.  Not many options but that's ok by me.
1419705849|5.0|This series was great to transition from picture books to real novels.  My son loves these books, and followed them with the Harry Potter series.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is great when sitting in the Dr.'s office, a lull at work or to get me sleepy at bedtime.  Price is good too.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This does the job, as you would expect -- a good app to have in the background for when you need it.  I subtracted a star because the user interface was confusing for me.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I liked this so much I upgraded and bought the full version.  I've been using my kindle fire as a backup alarm clock.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really wasn't sure what to expect of a first book from Ms. Flynn.  I don't know enough of her prior work to compare but I was, to put it mildly, blown away by this novel.  Mostly it's because she draws a character portrait of the protagonist who is so incredibly damaged that it's a wonder that she can even get out of bed, yet she &#34;goes home&#34; to confront evil in her community and within her own family.  I won't spoil the twist which is less than satisfying somehow, but I understand why she made the choice.  As a writer, Flynn doesn't flinch from her characters, no matter how horrible they appear - this is not easy (I know as I've reared back a few times from an &#34;ugly&#34; character in my own writing).  The reason she's a writer to watch for in the future is that she writes well and takes a well worn genre down a different pathway.  I enjoyed reading the book, devouring it, and was sorry it ended.  And yes, full disclosure, I read her other two novels in turn.  I'm now a fan.  Now, why can't she write them as fast as I can read them?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This &#34;game&#34; is great but I do recommend you start at the lowest level and build up.  There are multiple ways to solve the &#34;flow&#34; in the harder games and it can be challenging.
B0086700CM|4.0|No strategy or brain work, but really enjoyable and distracting. It makes a nice supplement to your game repertoire.  Great 5 minute filler.
B0099114WO|2.0|The trailers looked like this would be a wonderful comedy.  It wasn't.<br />It was actually a more serious adult drama and lacks any humorous content.<br />If you are thinking this movie is similar to Streep's &#34;It's Complicated&#34;......you will be VERY disappointed
B004X80QNG|1.0|I have been using almost every version of PI and very happy with it. I have just downloaded the kindle version but it crashes when i open it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Ted the teddy bear growing up with his childhood friend whose wish brought him to life is a cute premise.  However, Ted grows up to be a real scumbag and that's not cute or funny.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game story line love mystery of all kinds. video is really great too. love the G5 games need more of them out. keep them coming hours of entertainment just wish they had more chapters
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I love Zooey and I had heard from some other friends that this Christmas album was really good.  I love how she put her folksy twang on classic songs and their original song really put me into the Christmas spirit!
159514188X|5.0|This isn't the type of book I usually read - being both Young Adult and having a distinct lack of magic or paranormal oddities involved - but there was something about the blurb that caught my eye.<br /><br />It opens with the main character - Clay - parceling up a package ready to post and then rewinds 24 hours to tell you how he got to that point.  The story is written in two voices - that of Clay and the second of Hannah, who has recorded a bunch of tapes prior to committing suicide and has had them sent (one by one) to a group of people, giving them thirteen reasons why she killed herself and the part they played in the decision.<br />Thirteen Reasons Why is not a comfortable read.  There is no `feel good' factor and, at times, it's almost painful as you \\"listen\\" to Hannah talking about the situations that slowly added to her unhappiness one by one, and at first each reason seems something very small and, for the most part, insignificant moments in life.  The further into the story you get, the more those little thoughtless instances become bigger - not because Hannah makes them big, but because as each one is explained and dissected it becomes part of a larger picture and the knock-on effect of each thoughtless action is shown.<br />Jay Asher, while not the most perfect writer, draws you into the head of a girl contemplating suicide and shows just how easy it is to ignore the signs which, in hindsight, seem so obvious.  You almost find yourself willing her to change her mind, even though it's made clear at the beginning that the deed has already been done and Hannah has taken her own life.  You feel for Clay who, throughout the initial tapes, keeps questioning what his part was and how he hurt her and when you do reach Clay's section, it's extremely poignant and sad.<br />Thirteen Reasons Why is a compelling, thought-provoking read and not for the faint-hearted.  I would recommend it to anyone, but would also suggest that you have something more humorous linedup to read afterwards.
0545128285|5.0|5 stars<br />is<br />not<br />enough,<br />I<br />believe it<br />is<br />worthy<br />of 10 ....<br />just me...<br />a lot<br />of action<br />writing<br />this...
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|super fun. a must have. game works great! couldn't put it down! well worth the download. this game is super addictive but so much fun!
158270208X|5.0|Bought as gift for my husband & it brought him to tears, he is very into the Secret now going to order one for me!
0670026182|5.0|Once again, my daughter loves this book, loves the layout, the photos and how it's presented.  Only hitch was the fact that because I bought it from Amazon, all the measurements are in pounds and ounces etc. instead of metric which is what my girls have grown up with.  Even so, she thinks this is quirky.
B003O86FMW|5.0|That was the best book I've ever read! =) I can't wait till I read the next book I'm sure it will be amazing
0857687751|5.0|Also for my daughter, this book was something she'd been wanting for ages.  She just loves the whole series of books and read each one numerous times.  She also loves the movies of course.  Just a brilliant way to bring it all together.
B00000J048|4.0|My 2 years-old loves it because it can move (turning) and can be combined anyway you want. Gives lots of fun and imagination. It is not too hard for her to assemble gears by herself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is grat I wish the worlds are bigger or like the Pc .minecraft is cool but needs armer more space and dogs cove systems and more but I like it the way It is naw
1932073221|5.0|I have many of these books, but this is the first from this author.  Very easy to read but lots of depth.  Lays out a nice concept for living happily.  In our culture, money equates to freedom, and this book puts the desire for money into perspective as a means to a fuller life.  Money is not the goal--it simply makes the beautiful journey possible.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book all I have to say I'm about to start the second book. I honestly hope it's as good as this one and not like the reviews claim it to be .
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I really enjoyed Batman Begins and looked forward to this movie, but I was disappointed.  The story line is great, the acting superb, but it is extremely dark and violent.  I think it could all have been done as effectively without all the gratuitous ugliness.  The depiction of the prosecutor after his burns was not believable and better suited to a horror movie.  A very good concept taken too far.
B005CRQ2Y4|2.0|I have never read a book that had single sentences running for two thirds of a page until I read this book. This book had no flow do to writers style of writing. I will read a later book by Pynchon before I decide if his style and stories work for me.
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|Do not waste your time unless your worship director Oliver Stone. I was really disappointed. A waste of time and money.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|In short, this book was amazing! It brought out emotions in me no other book has before. I just didn't see it coming....Wow.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a very fun game that will amuse you for hours... gotta be quick...or the ole man will catch ya...
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|This movie was a little better than I thought It was gonna be. I saw all of the people<br />who gave the movie 1 star, which now after seeing it for myself, 1 start is quite ridiculous.<br />The story line is very original!<br />There are lots of plot twists.<br />The movie is interesting from the beginning all the way to the end.<br />And the ending was very good.<br />The ending was different.<br />It was UN expected.<br />A really good 4 star movie here.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Interesting from the beginning. A lot of unexpected turns. Ends a little too slow, but wrapped up nicely. Emotionally satisfying.
B0091REZMW|1.0|you have to pay you can not just keep playing it might be fun if it would just let you play
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day has a new fan! not much to say other than love love love loved! can't wait for #3! any and all 50 Shades fans should definitely check out The Crossfire series!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Indeed worth the buy. What an epic end to trilogy. Great characters and scenes. Bane was an awesome villain too .
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I chose this game because I like to play the card game and nobody else in my family does. I really enjoy it!
B00AF614OA|1.0|I watched and enjoyed season 1 for a lot of the same reasons others did.  I expected more of the same this season.  I made it through three episodes and stopped.  It is a non-stop series of scenes depicting humiliation, gratuitous cruelty and violence, outright torture, sadism, bondage and obedience, degrading and violent sexuality, simple ghoulishness, and on and on. I find nothing redeeming in this series. There is nothing in it I would call a plot or a narrative arc or character development.  Any more than there is in your average porno production.  Just a pretext for more \\"torture porn.\\"<br /><br />There is no wit or humor or depth or insight, either.  It is just relentlessly and oppressively cruel.<br /><br />The fact that it has so many positive reviews tells me that it has found a cult following - not that it actually deserves positive reviews.<br /><br />I think the actors in this series are not only wasted. I think they are degrading themselves and damaging their reputations by participating in the project. I will never be able to watch Jessica Lang, James Cromwell, Evan Peters or any of the other actors without unfortunate flashbacks to this series. Unfortunately, I used to enjoy these and other artists connected with the series. I wish I had never purchased the first episode. At least then I wouldn't have these awful associations tainting my memories of these actors.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The description says it's subtitled in english, but I find subtitles distracting.  Does anyone know if there's an option to turn off the subtitles?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Susan
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but I found the set-up better than the resolution. The Vegas setting was fun and done well, and I liked the way the author played around with the timeline in the early chapters. I love a good arranged marriage/marriage of convenience story, and in a contemporary setting those are hard to come by.<br /><br />I was disappointed that Connor was so stupid about acknowledging his feelings, though. The man who swears off love and then refuses to admit it until he almost loses his beloved is a romance staple, and Connor certainly had the angsty childhood motivation to justify his reluctance. But I'm always suspicious of \\"love\\" that is felt more in the absence of the lover than in the presence. Seeing how badly he was hurting Megan didn't wake him up to the realization that he loved her, but having to be without her did, and that suggests to me that his love is a selfish one, more about his happiness than hers. So even though I accepted their reconciliation at the end, it was tainted for me by what he put her through.<br /><br />That said, the story flowed really well and sucked me in, and I enjoyed the writing style. I liked the fleshed-out feel of the contemporary setting, where both characters had careers and friends. I will read more by this author and more books in this new Harlequin line.
1423113497|3.0|A gift. Seemed appreciated. Didn't personally read it. Apparently this series is a big hit with the 9-12 set. Why won't Amazon permit brief reviews, I wonder?
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I absolutely loved the first two flix in this \\"trilogy\\" and was looking forward to this one. While I did enjoy it it could easily have been 20-30 minutes shorter and not diminished the story. As usual the special effects were great and the acting equally good. I just think certain elements of the story \\"dragged on\\" while other equally important issues were glossed over. One of the big points being communicated was that it did not matter who \\"Batman\\" was but that the existence of a \\"Batman\\" was what was important. I am not into long drawn out reviews so I will conclude this one by adding that the ending leaves open a lot of possibilities and this movie is absolutely worth watching.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|It was a good game till I got stuck.  Started a new game and got stuck at the same place.  I love hidden object games but this is really frustrating.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|so far i'm enjoying this free app. it has lots of sound options and a timer - good for short meditations and relaxation.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|All of my friends who don't own this record will get one from me, I will buy every one of them a copy! Already have gifted one! This record is so, so, so good. I can't articulate just what it is about the music that I love so much except that it's Rush! I Love Rush so it's only natural I would like Clockwork Angels. The record goes into every aspect of what I feel makes the band so great. The Simplicity and complexity are equally balanced with splashes of old school. Many people dislike them because they selfishly want Rush to sound the way they expect Rush to sound, that's a huge mistake. Rush will always sound like Rush, they have never followed the trends of heavy crunchy distortion or super sloppy whammy bar dives or tuning super low tunings. Or super fast double bass and blast beats, it's as if people expect Rush's next record to sound like Deicide. Well that's never going to happen. This album being a concept record doesn't seem like it when you just casually listen, but if you sit and read the lyric sheet and the story that goes with it, it's a neat little story about a journey and the lessons learned!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Nothing like what I had expected, I read the entire book in just under 3 days which says a lot for me. Each chapter left me hanging & longing for more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Looved it I couldn't put the book down and had to read the next in series. I had recommend this to everyone must read book.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|great product<br />18 more words required 18 more words required 18 more words required 18 more words required 8 more words required
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game. The different levels and worlds provide a consistently new challenge.  I would recommend this game to everyone!
B009329ZF2|5.0|I bought this for my son-in-law for Christmas and he said it was great. Very fast service and we were very pleased.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Xmas and it goes great with the Julia Child cookbook I also bought for her.  She can cook for her girlfriends from the cookbook one night and than they can watch the movie.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|i love her voice, and also the lyrics of this cd. so for me this was her best  cd. hope to see more of her work.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|I love the whole Twilight series and had to have this to add to my collection.  I added to my Amazon video library.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is very easy to use. It will be quite handy on our roadtrip to Las Vegas. I like the weather alerts and the videos.
0375413405|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Xmas and it was her favorite gift.  She loves it.  She and her husband made a potato recipe from it for New Year's and it was fantastic.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Nice app. Fun and fast. Like wasting time with this app.  Just like the windows version. And it was totally and completely free.  Best part.
0345803485|4.0|I didn't realize until I really started reading this book how explicit it is.  The first book was enough for me.  I didn't get the other books in the series.
B00687PWQG|4.0|Well done. Portrayal of John and Abigail was done with care and craft. Abigail Adams is one of my all time favorite historical women.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good sequel.  Not as much action as the first, but not as boring as others have made it out to be.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and have been playing for a year now on my Kindle Fire.  I'm at Level 60, so now what?  I don't have all the property yet but I don't spend any real money.  I also have this game on my smart phone.  It has been upgraded to level 65.  Just wondering if I will get an update on my Kindle.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Has to be one of the wordiest books I've ever read.  It was so wordy it detracted from the story.  The abridged version is a heck of a lot better.
B009JBZH54|5.0|BADASS!!!! Special features are great. Comes with a cool 64 page book filled with art and concept drawings. Very Pleased with purchase
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I prefer the score to the soundtrack.  I don't really care for the taste in music on the soundtrack.  Not that they're bad or anything,  I just find the music they picked more of a detractor for the movies.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love a good hidden object game, an so far this one has kept me interested. It has a good story line and great graphics.
B002JODUI4|5.0|Love him.  I find the music great to work out to at the gym.  Keeps me moving.  Love the logo.
B004LL6RB0|5.0|this boots are just perfect and well designed for winter season. keeps your feet confortable at all times.<br />strongly recommended.A+++
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Surprised I even bothered to finish this one.  Found the characters annoying.  Really surprised I finished this on.  I kept reading hoping it would get better.  This is the book version of the movie THE FOUNTAIN.  The only redeeming quality of that movie is the score.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The story is filled with interesting characters and an intricate unfolding of events.  As the reader learns about the characters s/he is made aware of the many ironies that exist in the relationships of  small town people  and small town life.
B008476HBM|3.0|Ok book.  Movie was better and easier to follow on than the books.  Liked the characters in the movie better than those in the book,.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Another classic Clint Eastwood movie. He's as good as always and most of the supporting actors were good also .
B009HEP41A|5.0|This score really evokes the time period of the movie.  I find the music relaxing.  I love period pieces.  Makes me want to learn ballroom dancing.
0345803507|2.0|Every other scene was filled with sex.  Not much of a storyline.  I like a book to capture me.  After awhile I started skipping pages
B000B8QG22|5.0|I love Robin Williams in this movie.  It's a great story.  I love how it shows how the military controlling the media.
0345803485|2.0|Every other scene was filled with sex.  Not much of a storyline.  I like a book to capture me.  After awhile I started skipping pages
B005LAIHSG|3.0|ok movie.  Kristen Stewart did not add much to movie.  Did like Chris Hemsworth character.  I loved the fairies.  Didn't care for the queen.  She seemed pathetic, not evil.  Maleficent in the Disney version was much better.
0345803493|2.0|Every other scene was filled with sex.  Not much of a storyline.  I like a book to capture me.  After awhile I started skipping pages
0345505387|4.0|Not a real big fan of graphic novels but I liked getting Jamie's viewpoint. It's a decent addition to the outlander series.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was very tongue in cheek hilarious. It is a great and entertaining movie as long as you don't expect it to make sweeping societal commentary motivating change...
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Really great for a short story. I usually don't do short story but I loved this one.  I'm really hoping Brandon does a full novel in this world.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Originally put on as a late night movie to fall asleep to, but we both got so wrapped up we wound up staying up and watching the entire movie.  Simply this movie is one of the best sci-fi flicks I have seen in a really long time.  The script, visuals, and above all else the acting was stellar. It is refreshing to see a tasteful action sci-fi movie that doesn't have any chessy one-liners in it.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to sci-fi lovers and non-sci-fi lovers as well.<br /><br />Simply fantastic :)<br /><br />P.S. that little kid should be in ender's game.... just sayin :)
B007TBCTRK|3.0|Nothing thrilling here.  Better than the movie itself.  Won't rewatch the movie.  Will listen to CD again, albeit not a top choice.
140120841X|5.0|V for vendetta is one of the best graphic Novels I have ever read.  the artwork and story line alone should make you buy this.
B008S80P38|5.0|Love him.  I find the music great to work out to at the gym.  Keeps me moving.  Love the logo.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|this is a good video, the quality was very good and of course the movie is wonderful, hilariously funny, very well suited to all the family viewing.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was funny even while being sad.  I loved the dedication of this doctor and how he changed how doctor's view patients.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|DVDs are perfect, some minor cosmetic flaws, but nothing too bad, I'm not really interested in the cover anyhow. Just what I needed.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Was very funny and totally unexpected. Definitely for adults only. It was hilarious, touching, and a satire--all in one. Not what I expected at all.
B008K9UZY4|4.0|If you were a fan of Sonic when you were a kid this game will bring back great memories. 4 stars!  The game is easy enough for my 4 year old nephew to play.  I enjoy playing it when I am in between classes or waiting at the doctors office.  The graphics aren't terribly amazing, but who was really expecting them to be.  Overall I am happy with this game and would download it again.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Good as a gift.Does do multi-platform. Complaints of odd hearing, one ear for voices the other for music. She will still keep her other headset.
1573229725|5.0|Great Work!! Sarah Waters is definitely one of the best storytellers ever born!<br />The story is fast-pacing and gripping. The best part of the story is that it allows you to look back and reassess everything happened.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Of course the story is horrible!  But I would have paid $50 just to see Channing Tatum dance the whole time. Especially to &#34;My Pony&#34;.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent series to watch if you are into British sitcoms.  Gives you a great glimpse into what happens on real life.  Give it a try.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I like this book, except that so far it is rather negitive.  None of the charactors seem very likable.  However, I do intend to finish it, if only because it is JK Rowling.
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|Doesn't hold a candle to the British &#34;Sherlock,&#34; and not as well-written as &#34;The Mentalist,&#34; but it's entertaining.  It takes itself WAY too seriously, though, and the &#34;sober companion&#34; premise is rather clunky.  Sherlock is well played (but could be more amusing), but Watson seems miscast.  Hoping that things smooth themselves out in Season 2.  They often do.  I'll probably keep watching.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|We watched this movie when we were trying out the Amazon Prime trial service. It was quirky and interesting. The average Netflix  rating is 3.6 I would give it a 3. Entertaining but not memorable...
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I don't mind the crudeness as long as it is funny.  There were a few laugh out loud moments, but that is it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|love it...play it over and over again. looking forward to playing enigmatis 2<br />good buy. would definitely recommend.<br />definitely. am I at 20 words yet?
B0076DELIG|5.0|This latest offering of Harry Bosch is full of the themes MC is famous for.  Harry is getting older, his daughter is the balance in his life, and the crime rate has not gone down.  Seems to me that MC could continue this series through grandpa-hood and as they say in Toy Story.......To infinity and beyond.  Great read.  David Clarke, Florida
B000I5X80G|5.0|Hot on the heels of &#34;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&#34; this concert cooked. &#34;I'm Wonderin'&#34; played here didn't appear on an LP until &#34;Everybody's Rockin'&#34;, and &#34;Cowgirl in the Sand&#34; has an enjoyably funkier feel to it.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|The first of the series shows that a movie can be as good as the book. Characterization and casting equal brilliant.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This has to be the best book I have ever read(beside the Twilight Saga). I can't wait until I am able to get the next book!! Hope it is as good as this one was.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I tried for a long time to understand what this book was telling me, but I am still completely in the dark. I really want to publish a book on kindle but I couldn't follow the instructions in this book at all. My computer did not show me the tabs that this book instructed me to click on so I was totally lost. Very disappointed. Maybe I am just too dumb when it comes to PC's.
B001CL4N68|5.0|Classic.  Real hip hop.  Lyrical venom.  There is nothing else to say about this album.  You have to be crazy to not appreciate this album.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's easy and fun.  It provides simple tasks while allowing you to create your own city.  It's creative with the ability to be challenging.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I would be lost without this app. I use this app daily and love this app it is an extension of my brain.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|After seeing seasons 1 and 2, I can't wait for season 3.  Must see if you like King Arthur style of movies/TV. Great series!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was so intense I read it in one day because one you have started the book there's no turning back .
B007YOC4RW|5.0|Great work on the guitar, Joe.  This is a very good album and one that a Joe Bonamassa fan would greatly appreciate.  Amazon Cloud also is a great way to keep your music available on all devices.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|By the time you get to the more complicated grids, this game can be quite challenging. I like puzzles that challenge you, but are not based on  your knowledge. This is definitely one of those kind of puzzles
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy did an excellent job with this latest book, Threat Vector.  I really enjoyed the reading.  And, Amazon Kindle Reader made it available on my phone and laptop so that I could read it on the go.  Thanks for read, Tom Clancy.  And, thanks for the technology, Amazon.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The plot is interesting and the characters are very easy to emphasize with.  My heart just broke right along with them.
B0096C7QF0|5.0|Joe Bonamassa's music is great.  Especially enjoyed Midnight Blues.  Great riffs and guitar work.  And, the new Amazon Cloud is fab.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|well I like these types of games so I am a tad bit biased when it comes to rating them.
B000062X90|5.0|Wishbone Ash Argus on CD. It rocked hard when it came out and it still rocks hard now. Great remastering and nice packaging on this release. Nothing special about the packaging. Just a standard insert and CD case but that does not matter it rocks hard and is a great price. I got mine for $2.00 new for this must own album.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|The book is slow, takes a lot of time in details that I supposed where very important for the time, but for me they are not. I just think if your are looking for historic novels you can find something better. If you're looking for a love story very romantic and classic, I supposed this is the right one; I have to say that all my girlfriends love it... so I supposed it can be very enjoyable for some kind of people, not for pragmatic people like me.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|Always a favorite. I have never seem the original cut of this film but enjoy this one thoroughly. Love it
B003P2WJ6S|5.0|I enjoy this book like no other in years. Is a fascinating story that made me get into it in a way I can't explain. The research is impeccable. A story that had to be tell, and that cannot be done in a better way.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|This has got to be one of the worst Resident Evil movies i have ever seen. These are good actors and they made them look like they couldn't act. Very disappointed, the first three are the best.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is an amazing movie. I had watched previously, but I couldn't resist watch it again. Beautiful, well-made, great performance, for me is perfect.
B00867GHS8|5.0|The movie is wonderful and the opportunity to watch it on the kindle fire and ipad is a great option
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was watching Dr. Oz, and he interviewed the author of this book.  It piqued my interest, and I ordered an 2-version for my Kindle.  It is quite informative, and may make people reconsider their diets.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really nice graphics on my nexus 7. Looks really good on the high def sceen. I Iook forward to spending more time with it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME. YOU GET TO BATTLE LIZARD MONSTERS AND EVIL ELVES. THERE`S A Big troll in the game and he destroys stuff. It also has about 40 levels and tons of things to unlock. AND YOU CAN MAKE RAIN AND FIRE AND THUNDER AND SNOW CLOUDS.  T. and E.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|A very well written and produced story.  Really gives great insight to the changes in social setting brought about by WW I and thereafter. Enjoyed wathing the seasons on a continuium.
B009X01FJS|5.0|Has a sleek design, very catchy, and very functional. I love that you can spin and view horizontally and vertically.  And that you can charge while still in the case due to the spin feature.  A nice compact case for my new Fire HD.<br /><br />Love it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is one of the few artists that my husband and I can agree on and we both love this album. Even my seven year old son has to listen to it every time we get in the car. His favorite is &#34;Rumors&#34; but he thinks she's saying &#34;Boomerang&#34;. ;D
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Not my usual type of read, but by far one of the best books ive ever read.  I Love it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is awesome and leaves no stone unturned. Will leave you breathless and ready to turn the next page.
B0094MB298|5.0|Great flick.  It is a little crass but hilarious. Has some great one liners too.  Laughed the entire time I watched it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I didn't think I would because of all the hype from the movie. I wasn't sure that the premise of the story was going to catch my attention, but it did. Now on to the next book.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Definitely undershown!  A must-see for any music lovers!  Tunes are awesome & unforgettable!  Great lyrics too!  Don't pass this up!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Flowers is a wonderful, musical, relaxing and visually stimulating video game. It is much shorter than \\"regular\\" video games, but the value is in the experience not the time it takes to play!
B0030B1WBM|2.0|I ordered this movie for the kids but they didn't finish it. At 4 and 8, they just stopped watching it. I thought it was too loud, too rude and too far from the feel of the original tale. It was visually interesting although the story lacked charm.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is too weird sexually for my taste.  I read about a quarter of the book and closed the book.
075669812X|4.0|My grandson lives and breathes ninjago right now, so what better gift.  Full color photos about all his favorite characters in a hard cover book.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I loved this book! I could not put it down! Can't wait to read the  next one! And I cannot wait to tell my grandson about it.
B008476HBM|3.0|My first read on Kindle and I have to say it was a delight to venture back into the pages of a novel I first read many years ago.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This is better than the last one and I wouldn't have believed that was possible. Watching a Celtic Woman DVD is more spiritually uplifting than going to church! Now that I can watch it on my big screen TV with Bose sound I don't need to spend money on tickets to a live performance. I am looking forward to their next DVD!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I absolutely love this! I'm a huge fan of the Dark Knight Trilogy and this box set just made me love it even more!! Great special features included and they are very in depth.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Owners son talking: Ok so I hear about this unbelievably scary game called slender, but I couldn't get it on my laptop for some reason so I get this game... I guess its fine for giving you a kind of &quot;I don' like this surrounding.&quot; feeling but its far far far away from Ju-on: The Grudge which when I first played it I crapped my pants. Just kidding, but really get Grudge for a scary game. I still liked it though and its worth the buck I payed.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I was expecting a bit more climactic ending. Overall, however, it's another fun page-turner from Flynn that most will certainly enjoy who've read other books in the Rapp series.
1609611543|5.0|I've heard of the Paleo diet and other reduced grain diets, and this book definitely gave me a reason to stick to it! Wow, if you're tired of gaining weight and/or just feel lousy, stop eating wheat for a week. You'll never go back. Dr. Davis provides more than enough evidence of wheat's evil nature and more than enough reasoning for you to chuck it. Everyone should read this, five stars!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Did not and will not read, should have a X rating on the cover, never realized it was so smutty. No wonder their were some blank spaces in the review. Sorry,would not recommend to anyone.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have been enjoying this series since the first book. Would highly recommend beginning with the first Pendergast novel in order to fix the theme and personalities in their mind so the readers can progress thru the series, they will be rewarded.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is theory action packed and suspenseful<br />The rest you will have to read on to find out what happens
B005LAIIJY|5.0|this movie is off the f'n chain, i could watch this all day. Dont forget what we went through folks.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book still isn't as good as the first but it has more twists than the second book did. There was more imagery included to allow one's imagination to take flight with the passages.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|A black pilot thats on drugs an alcohol, flies the plane for like 5min of the movie, falls in love with a white woman an goes to jail. Bravo an oh he has baby mama drama an the son needs a ass whoopin.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great book!  It had GOOD ending.  I would recommend this book highly.  I am looking forward to the movie.

B0015DRPJU|5.0|I have read all of the series already and each book just keeps getting better and better.  The show of committment they share and the action is so well written that I couldn't put the books down.  Such great characters and drama.  Very good author!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|No gooey, drooling aliens. No invisible superpowerful beings. Just a guy, his ingenuity, a crushingly hostile environment, and a humongous will to live. Will he make it? Clever, clever story. It reminded me of Peter Telep's, Red Planet, but Weir cranked the intensity level up to 11 on a scale of 1 to 10.  I wish I'd written it.<br /><br />James Ide, The Nintoku Incident
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book had been recommended to me by multiple friends, and as strange as it was I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched the entire Season 1 in one day and spent the next day watching Season 2! I can hardly wait for Season 3.
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|I know, I know, the Next Generation is from the other franchise.<br />My son loves this film and we have watched all the regular movies together so now he understands who the characters are and how they fit in to the story.  He particularly likes watching the droids.  It is nice to get more story from this universe.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I purchased the print by John Shaw, magnificent, and one of the best of John's over the last twenty five years.<br />It was he that informed me of the book, I ordered it immediately...A great read.<br /><br />Joe Dillon
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Decent backgammon app with support for match play, 2-player games (perfect for long flights) and real-world dice, where you enter the rolls. Good for beginners and casual players; diverting but not terribly challenging for experienced players, as doubling cube strategy is weak. Board feels a bit small, should lose the borders and use full screen. Still, worth the bargain price.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I love this box set! The only exception being that the digital copy that it comes with does not work with iTunes.
0399160450|3.0|clancy is writing the same book over and over again. he should be looking at characters that predate the john ryan story line, he has a lot of ideas to draw from there
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I love the movie so much that I bought it for my son and I to watch at night before bedtime! Great action, great adventure and an excellent story line.
0812550706|5.0|It is hard to say what first drew me to this novel.  I have seen it, and its sequels, in public school classrooms.  A friend, concerned about censorship, and teachers getting treated badly by school administration, sent me a link to a news story where a person was nearly fired for reading from this book in class.<br /><br />The teacher in question was also the subject of a criminal investigation related to this book being taught, and the story made national news at the time.  Here is how Forbes reported on it: South Carolina Teacher Suspended For Reading Students `Ender's Game' Will Not Face Criminal Charges<br /><br />This story was originally published in 1977, by Analog, edited by Ben Bova.  It was not until 1985 that Tor published the story as a novel.  The book has staying power, and is being made into a movie starring Harrison Ford. At this time, IMDB, lists its release date in November 2013.<br /><br />The story line is that aliens have twice attacked Earth, and humanity's existence is at stake.  The government, through genetic breeding, is making a person to assume command of the battle fleet.  That person is Ender Wiggin.  He is only six years old at the start of the book.<br /><br />As Ender, and others like him, are taken from their families for intense training, Ender must learn to adapt and survive.  Ender's survival is not the only one at stake, for although he does not know it, time is running out.  His training may or may not be enough. No one knows.<br /><br />This book is mandatory reading.  There, you have your assignment!  For young adults, the suspense will make a great story.  For those interested in leadership, the historical references will provide food for thought.  For educators, the moral purpose of education is good debate material.<br /><br />For its originality and great story telling, this book gets 5 stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I immediately fell in love with the characters. Their stories and their relationships with one another were so intense. The love story that develops is raw and passionate and would make any hopeless romantic swoon. I was captivated by the story that unfolded from the get go. Could not stop turning the page. Quick read!!! Absolutely loved it and would recommend to anyone who loves a good love story even a semi mystery story... you won't be disappointed.
B0047VSW30|5.0|To use for this film--my husband (an astronomer) and I watched it and were totally enthralled by it.  The other positive reviews do it total justice!  I am so glad I discovered this in my course of research about Hypatia.  All the principal actors and supporting cast were brilliant and the cinematography was beautiful and realistic.  I can't think of one bad thing to say about this film and I don't like many films I watch lately!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|We bought the movie without having seen it before.  Overall my family liked the movie.  I missed the music and singing that usually happen in a Disney princess movie.  My 4-year-old daughter was a little scared at parts.  Not as well developed as other Disney princess movies.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. Really enjoyed playing this game. Would like more like this. Would recommend this game to others. It was really fun.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I chuckled at parts but it was predictable and most of the funny parts were in the previews. Worth $1-$2 to rent :)
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Liam Neeson does it again in this survival movie, up against treacherous wolves in barren stricken alaskan wilderness. Dont miss this one!
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie, but as usual the book was better, they left a lot of key parts out. I guess the strict movie watchers will get the jist of the series by watching it ;)
B005LAIGLE|5.0|Action packed, Mark Wahlberg sets this movie in front row seats. For the love of family, he must owe one more mission. Check this one out!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this is one of the best books Suzanne Collins has ever written it is one of my favorite books
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the graphics  to this game is awesome; the only negative things is that after the introduction its not free anymore.
0887431453|5.0|My kids LOVE these workbooks and so do I!  Unlike other pre-K workbooks, this doesn't start off with letters.  Instead, it focuses on the action of circles, loops, and lines that form the basis for writing letters. The kids trace circles, squares. They draw straight lines, curvy lines and squiggly lines.  All this is in a very fun, bright-colored way.  The book progresses through colors, letters, tracing, math, etc.  My kids will pull these out and announce, &#34;Mom!  I'm going to work on my workbook!&#34;  They will happily do this easily for an hour, seated at our kitchen counter while I prepare meals.  I'm close enough to check their work and help as needed, chatting and encouraging as they go through the pages.  I highly recommend this workbook.  In fact, so far I've been happy with all the workbooks published by School Zone.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My daughter is loving this game!  She's playing it on my Galaxy S3.  In the 48 hours it has been on my phone, she has played it for more than 6 hours.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This is a terrific book. I'm not even a Stephen King fan, and I enjoyed it so much. It's about time travel and it will keep you glued to your Kindle!
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I think that Robert Downey has a unique talent for the quirky type of intellect that he plays here.  During the movie one can easily be drawn into the complex and intertwined type of thinking that he displays and it is a wonderful excerise of the brain.<br />Most entertaining though is the relationship that Holmes has with Watson who as &#34;partners&#34; they travel the movie together.  Watson has now brought the Woman of his desires into their relationship.  Yes, they had a very deep and comfortable relationship in mind and spirit that is threatened by the fiance'.  All this makes for good humor as Holmes &#34;acts up&#34; at a dinner meeting by displaying the process of reasoning and deduction that paints a not so elegantly dainty and portrait of their newest member to the group.<br />The story really takes off when Holmes is sort of hired bya Society to help them with their situation.  From here the plots spin up into 3 or 4 separate but carefully intertwined processed that are so artfully managed that the viewer barerly notices the oncoming of an ultimate concussion where all action lines merge into a single event and once again our dear Mr. Holmes is eventually found to be the man on top of the whole monumentious entanglement of Police, the Bad guys, Parlament, Holmes and Company and of course the innocent who is left not actually so innocent by the final scene.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The case is not that nice but for the 3 movies its great because you get them and the special features for each disc if you are interested. Its a good collection for a good price if you are into the Dark Knight movies.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie has a great story to it. Old Baseball Scout with a daughter and the family dynamics involved around the game of baseball just makes for a great movie to watch. How can you go wrong with Clint, and throw Justin Timberlake in there......Great movie
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Why do authors have to curse likeable characters?  I really cared about the protaganist.  And the poor guy in prison...
B008Y6UND6|2.0|It seemed at crucial times the sound/language was impossible to tell what was being said.  I read the book and they needed to cut back on some details to fit it into a movie - I just wish they would have cut back on the numerous rape scenes involoving Lisbeth and her guardian.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was one of my favorites in high school.  It was so great to revisit it now again. Worth the read!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The price is right for this basic game. The cards actions from a simple tap save lots of finger motion from dragging a card. The contrast options are great. Thanks for the free option.

1469984202|5.0|If you haven't read a stitch of Howey's books, you may be wondering if you should buy the first wool or buy them all.  I'll skip to the chase, buy them all.  I bought them 5 days ago, and read them all, they are ridiculous.  Ridiculous because I've never in my life read a work of fiction as well-written and well-plotted as this book.  It's certainly a classic and it's only a year old.  I may in fact, also, be obsessed with Hugh Howey.  What a literary genius!  I hope he is handsomely rewarded and doesn't have to give all of his proceeds to our government...
0307352145|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but early on the author tells a story about how after a short meeting with some others, a person attending the meeting received two job offers from other attendees the very next day,  The job offers were entirely because of this person's input at this one meeting.  Pretty farfetched  so to me it taints a lot of what she says in the rest of the book.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great read. I am going to read it again and again in the future. : ) the only down side is you have to pay for it.
B003008RWA|5.0|I ordered this rental so I could watch it for a college class.  It was so easy and convenient.  One of the many reasons I love dealing with Amazon!!  Thank you
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game shows my son a lot of different things.  I even like to play sometimes 1-10. 6 this game is good for little people and adults
B005COO1X6|3.0|A little too wacky for me but avid S. King readers might like it.  Just too far out for me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|There are few books that make me laugh, cry and everything in between. But this masterpiece will make you do everything. This story touches the heart.
B006O6F932|3.0|the plastic clould have been more durable. I was thinking like more like the Brat doll house but she was happy and that is what matters..
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book was very touching in that I learned a lot about being happy and developing friendships. I especially enjoyed the characters and how their roles were brought about; Charlie`s especially. The amount of times charlie and his friends cried made the theme especially sentimental. Although there was no evident plot to the story, the overarching meaning of the novel stands out. I did like how the reader is immediately in suspense questioning if there is indeed something wrong with Charlie. Revealing in the end how he was raped my his aunt as a child completes the book and ties everything together.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never, ever, ever written a review for Amazon about anything I've read.  EVER!  But this book?  This book was amazing.  AMAZING!  I just finished reading this boon from beginning to end without stopping. And there are just no words. Bravo Colleen Hoover. Bravo!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a wonderful book!!! I would recommend this book to any woman, or man really . Really changes your expectations for things.
B009NF54ZE|1.0|Worst game Ive played.  Timed hidden object are frustrating and boring.  No storyline.  Even at 99 cents I feel ripped off.  Don't buy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loooovvvveeee this book!!! Way better then the movie. Definitely a must read.I can't wait too read the rest of the series!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|More juicy than the first book. However the plot muddled and all over the place. The descriptions are the same from the last book. The use of repetition may be important but they get in the way of the story.
B0052REUW0|5.0|This book will change the way you look at the world around you.<br />Pinker surveys the history of the world and shows how violence has declined over the decades.<br />The moral arc of the universe slopes upwards.<br />Pinker writes very well and has exhaustive notes, sources and other scholarly apparatus.<br />Great book.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|My nephew in law was overwhelmed when he opend it. The only problem is the Sargent Pepper album is out of whack and he is going to have to get that one replaced otherwise it would have gotten five stars.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Interesting, illuminating to those of us with little understanding of that part of history - thanks Doris we need more historians like you.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is an extremely enjoyable game to fill up the cracks in your day!  The graphics and music are lighthearted. The game play is challenging enough to be rewarding but not frustrating.<br /><br />The only causes for concern that I came across are the extremely long time it took the &quot;mushroom&quot; option to load when first activated, and the quick way that the levels fly by.
B005IQZB14|5.0|As someone who was native to Oregon, raised in Minnesota,  it was like old home week. Gutsy gal - appreciate her tell all style though it was hard to take.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Just finished and the memory of Chris weighs on my heart. Although Chris MCcandless received tons of criticism for his &#34;naivety and reckless behavior&#34; I think that was the whole point. Our lives are directed, labelled and meticulously organized from school to work to family relations. This conformity and lack of humanity in general society is what pushed Chris further into the unknown, no lists, no steps to follow - just whims and dreams. I admire that although most thought him stupid I think it was entirely brave to discover and bask in nature in such a innocent, eager and simple way. He was educated, caring and sociable making many dear friends through his traveling. Was he ill prepared? Probably, would he have survived if he had known more about the river patterns during the seasons? More than likely. But I would like to think of Chris in the best memory I can, one who lived out his dreams in the extreme. Full enveloped in natures consuming grip, I think he had more respect than most for the land and its amazing existence.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is AWESOME!!! Five stars!!! It was worth every penny! If you like the pocket addition try the computer one.
B009NPA3MS|3.0|i am a dave matthews band fan, but not HUGE. I like Philp Phillips on American Idol and liked his first radio release, but honestly I am not that impressed with this cd. It is good, don't get me wrong, but sounds like the 10 other DMB cd's I already have. I think he is more talented than what was show cased on the cd.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is addictive as #$%^!!! I cant speak to earlier editions of the series, but this game for the Vita is pretty magnificent. The graphics are sharp, the story is engaging, the characters are funny and accessible, and the gameplay is intuitive. Pretty standard turn based combat mechanics as far as JRPG's are concerned, and as always (or so it seems), the game centers around teens in school, lol. Seriously though, the past reviews have detailed the actual game well. I think it is stellar and put an hour or two in pretty much every night before I go to sleep. Sadly, all my other Vita games are gathering dust right now. This game definitely dominates the competition and absorbs all of my Vita time. Great...in fact, amazing game. A definite must own.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show! There is very little more to say I thoroughly enjoy it and am glad to have it on my kindlefire so where ever I am. I can watch it.
0060012358|5.0|Whether he's writing for adults or children, Terry Pratchett just has a knack for writing something that works. I've read most of his Discworld novels, and some of his non-Discworld novels, and I've loved every single one of them.<br /><br />This one was particularly memorable.<br /><br />This is the story of what happens when rats and cats get influenced by magic, and become \\"changelings\\" that can talk and think like humans. Behind every mastermind rat plague is Maurice, a cat who has figured out how to turn the rat plagues to his benefit. Include a kid who acts as the rat piper, and a girl who is convinced the whole thing is a \\"story\\" and you have a great tale.<br /><br />Whether or not you like animals, or you are an adult or a child, you are bound to enjoy this one. It is aimed at children, but all the adults will have a good chuckle too.
0698115635|5.0|This is a product that my grand daughters had seen and read but wanted to have for their own. It was as described and delivered in record time.
1596912863|5.0|Every now and then I come across a novel that begs me to stop reading all other books, and start it immediately. For this month, that novel was \\"Austenland\\".<br /><br />Austenland is a wonderful tale of a 30-something Austen devotee, who is stuck on the notion that the perfect man is Mr Darcy, and no other can compare. She is so obssessed with Mr Darcy, that her rich Aunt sends her to \\"Austenland\\" to try to cure her of this obssession.<br /><br />Jane sets out on an adventure to live in the world of the 1800s, where she meets similar characters to Mr Bingley, Mr Darcy and the Bennetts.<br /><br />This has to be one of the best dedicated-to-Austen books I've read. Shannon Hale has a superb writing style, that leaves you wanting to read it until you are all finished. If it hadn't been for feeding my twins around the clock, I would have read this in one sitting.<br /><br />For those of that have huge Colin Firth crushes, and believe he is the true Mr Darcy, there is a little something in here for you too. I especially admired her dedication in the front of the book:<br />\\"For Colin Firth, You're a really great guy, but I'm married, so I think we should just be friends\\".<br />And in her acknowledgements, \\"And honey, you know that this Colin Firth thing isn't really serious. You are my fantasy man and my real man. I need no other fella in all the world besides you. It's a girl thing, I swear\\".<br /><br />I'm not sure I can proclaim that it is just a girl thing, because this book is making me want to run for my BBC Dvds of Pride & Prejudice. Not to mention wanting to re-read all of Jane Austen's books.<br /><br />Anyway I give this one a 10/10, best dedicated to Austen book I've read.

0061478784|4.0|Howl's Moving Castle is a delightful young adult fantasy novel by Diana Wynne Jones, that sees the readers enthralled with a mix of fantasy and fairy tales. Our heroine is Sophie Hatter, the eldest of three girls, who is convinced that as the eldest she will never be a success or be able to seek a fortune. Instead she is stuck at the Hat Shop, owned by her family, toiling away, decorating hats. However, one day her life is changed forever when she meets the Witch of the Waste. She is propelled on a journey that involves a scarecrow, a castle that never stops moving, a fire demon called Calcifur and a very vain wizard.<br /><br />This book was such a pleasure to read. Ever since Charmed Life I have been a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan, and I've been slowly making my way through her collection of tales. She has a wonderful knack for writing stories that simply leap off the pages and keep you riveted until the very last sentence. Howl's Moving Castle is another example of her incredible talent.<br /><br />The characters in Howl's Moving Castle are simply wonderful. We have the adorable heroine Sophie, who can't seem to piece together the mystery and restore her life, and the ever-vain Wizard Howl, along with his apprentice Michael. Not since Chrestomanci (in Charmed Life) have I found characters to love and cherish this much.<br /><br />Between pages of adventures, there is so many \\"laugh out loud\\" moments as Diana Wynne Jones has spun a tale that is set back and forth from a fantasyland, to modern day Wales. The wonderfully funny fire-demon Calcifur will definitely win a few hearts over, along with Howl.<br /><br />If it wasn't snowing outside, I would be racing right out to grab Castle in the Air, the second book in this series.
1416987118|5.0|Great Book. Great illustration. The girls love it.  It was as described and delivered in record time.I would suggest it to children under 5 yrs.
0062073567|5.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is possibly the most popular Agatha Christie novel. At the time of its publication, 1926, it was considered the best mystery novel ever written. The ending in a word was \\"sensational\\".<br /><br />It is a rarity that I actually guess \\"whodunit\\". But reading the first few chapters of this book, I thought wouldn't it be funny if \\"X\\" did it and I was right! I didn't guess out of good deduction, but I did guess correct!<br /><br />Saying that, the ending is unexpected and very sensational, and it is definitely a must read for all mystery and Agatha Christie fans.<br /><br />It is another Hercule Poirot novel and whether you consider him the greatest detective, or, in my opinion, very conceited, it is very enjoyable!
0142403873|5.0|exciting book for my young grand daughters. They asked for it so were pleased to receive it. I loved reading it to them.  It was as described and delivered in record time.
0062073486|5.0|The thing that I love about Agatha Christie's is their uniqueness. No two are alike, even two that have the same detective.<br /><br />\\"And then there were none\\" is in a class all of its own, though. It has been previously published under the name of Ten Little Indians and is set on an island where ten people die. One by one they are killed off by a madman and there is no detective in the main part of the story, and you get to almost the end and think it is going to go unsolved. Until the epilogue that is, where is solved.<br /><br />It is a lot different to the style of Ms Christie's other books, but still enjoyable. I believe this particular story has been made into quite many telemovies. The only telemovie I've actually seen is \\"Death on the Nile\\".
B00009RAJH|5.0|My 28 yr old daughter has recently discovered Fleetwood Mac so I was happy to obliger her with a few cds.  It was as described and delivered in record time.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is best known for her \\"Shopaholic\\" series, starting with Confessions of a Shopaholic. Whilst this series is enjoyable, its definitely not one of my favourites. However when I saw Remember Me? I couldn't resist giving this author another try. I'm so glad that I did.<br /><br />Remember Me? is the story of a 28-year-old London career woman, Lexi, who wakes up from a car accident and she can't remember the last three years of her life. She can't remember her rise to senior management at Deller Carpets, she can't remember getting married, she can't even remember her husband. As the story goes along, she must try to piece together her life and find out how her life got so different to what she remembered, some three years earlier.<br /><br />This is a really great piece of female literature. It is fun and sassy and the characters are all well likable, from her husband, Eric, who has a policy and procedure for everything, including foreplay in their \\"marriage manual\\", to her some-what annoying mother, who lives with 20 dogs.<br /><br />The storyline of \\"girl gets amnesia and must piece together her life\\" is somewhat predictable and has been done many times over, but Sophie Kinsella gives it a fresh start and creates a story that is much loved from beginning to end.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I am a fan of animated movies.  Compared to Japanese anime, it not as great.  But for a Disney quality anime, it is one of their best.  The story line was very interesting and the action was suspenseful.  Good clean, enjoyable entertainment for the family.

B000KX0IOK|3.0|GOSLING portrays a teacher in a rough, urban school/neighborhood with a SEVERE drug habit---BUT, he does it BRILLIANTLY. SHAREEKA EPPS is VERY GOOD as troubled young girl, a student in his class, who discovers his drug addiction. This is an independent movie that is completely character driven. Not a feel good movie. RYAN GOSLING is an OVER THE TOP TALENT. I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY HIS PERFORMANCE. The movie is a three, but RYAN GOSLING'S PERFORMANCE IS 5 STARS PLUS.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|Hilarious, kids movie about an alien from outer space coming to Eath and posing as a dog.  Great movie for all ages.

B003WJQ74E|4.0|I teach the abridged version to my 8th graders, so it was interesting to read the whole thing. Heartbreaking at times, though.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I like the game. It is a great mindless time waster. You swipe your finger through fruit and it explodes into bright colors.<br />Unfortunately, I bought the paid version to avoid ads, but it still has them. You also earn useless &quot;rewards&quot; that get you coupons for things I don't want. You can avoid this by turning off the wi-fi, but it is still an annoyance.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|Meh. Just meh. Nothing special. I can see where the director was trying to go with the direction of this movie but unfortunately, he missed the mark and the end result is that this movie is just &#34;meh&#34;. I wouldn't see it again, even if it came on cable and there was noting else on.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is the first year I'm using an app instead of a paper calendar. I was nervous at first due to the price, but after reading reviews saying you could sync your Google Calendar across all devices I decided to go ahead and try it.<br />I purchased the app from Amazon for my Kindle Fire,  and the same app from Google Play for my Android phone, and everything is working perfectly, the calendars on both devices synced correctly.
0307592731|1.0|This book is incredibly poorly written, dull as can be, and, as far as I'm concerned, pointless. The writer comes across as an idiot. Save your money and your time.
B0013ND30M|5.0|My 5 year old granddaughter was thrilled to add this to her Disney collection.  Her other was thrilled, too ( she's a kid at heart).  The seller even included an extra disc - Cinderella.  What a nice surprise.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie met my super hero expectations! I loved it. It's worth owning.  A great end to the trio.  Newer actors did a great job.  The villain has a bright future.  I enjoy all of  his movies. He is a natural born gangster!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Spend time using your mind.  Keeps you busy trying different statagies.  Some easy, some boggling.  For ages Kindergarten through adult.  Nice app for free, i havent tried the pay version.
B002NS2HBM|5.0|I miss this show.  Excellent writing. Got of track near end of last season, as they always do.  Great acting.
B007PKDW44|4.0|So far I have gone through the disc a few times now and it keeps getting better and better. They really tried to do different things with some of the songs so there is a mix of styles. I am very happy with this purchase.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Riveting. No time to write this review...must start right away on the third book! I CANNOT stop reading. The suspense!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I downloaded this book because A: it was on Amazon's top 100 list, and B: it was free. I figured that it had to be fairly good if it made the top 100 list. I did not realize until I got to the end of the book that it is a Harlequin romance novel. When I was in college and single I used to devour Harlequin novels and other \\"smut books\\" that I purchased at the local thrift store (they were a lot more interesting than my textbooks). As I matured (and I met my husband) I lost interest in smut books. Had I realized this was a Harlequin novel, I would not have downloaded it let alone read it.<br />That being said, the beginning of the book was pretty funny. I was laughing hysterically. Then the smut turned on. I don't know why I finished reading the book. It was predictable that they were going to live happily ever after, but I did finish reading it anyway. Perhaps it was a hope that there would be something meaningful other than smut in the book. If you like smut books and Harlequin novels, you will like this book. If not, just go on to another title.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|A really great Christmas movie. A new holiday classic. My children loved this movie. I wish we could have seen it on the big screen.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|If you haven't seen MadMen yet, start on Season One and work your way to Season Five. If you have seen it, you're likely addicted, so there's no need to hook you in an Amazon review. I will say, Season Five was the strongest season yet. Brilliant writers and an amazing cast make this a worthwhile watch.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book... easy read, so fun to hear life from a dog's point of view! Great story as well...Must read!
030758836X|5.0|I'll start by saying the content and style of Gone Girl are not my typical cuppa tea—I'm not a mystery reader. I'm not a thriller-kinda person. To be honest, peer pressure made me read this book (not really, but all of my friends were, and it came highly recommended, so I caved). I can honestly say that Gone Girl is one of the best fiction books I've read in a long while — it sticks with you. It calls to you from you bedside table. It makes you turn off the tv to flip page after page. It tells you to leave work early to finish each chapter.<br /><br />Part One is amazing. Part Two is better. Part Three you never saw coming.<br /><br />Read this book. You won't be disappointed.
0385344228|5.0|I decided to read this book based on the reviews here at Amazon and I'm glad I did, it turned out to be a great book in my opinion. The ending was a complete surprise, one thing I saw coming the other one was a complete shock. If you love a good mystery/legal thriller then I think you'll enjoy this one because the more I read it the harder it was to put down. If you have kids it makes you think about how far you would go to defend your child if you were in Andy's situation.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Useless without play instructions. I don't know why other people like this game. I must be missing something. No fun.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|After going to my local retail stores (Best Buy, PC Richard) to look for DSLR bags I was a bit put-off by the prices.  Seemed like anything that was remotely decent was in the $100+ range and I just wasn't prepared to spend that much on a bag.  So I took to Amazon and found this one and decided to give it a go.  Turns out to be quite a nice bag for the $35 price tag, much better than I'd expected.  I'm able to fit my Nikon D5100, 3 lenses, all my cables/filters/hoods as well as my iPad 3 (in the front pouch).  Seems like a decent quality bag, zippers are nice, padding is good.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|Nice idea, great visuals. The sounds are not so great. The controls seem to be a little until responsive, and too small. There really should be an option to resize the controls to suit the user's preference.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|i was listining to the radio one morning and heard this artist. i was amazed at the sound of her music
1455523550|5.0|Be prepared to set a little time aside to read this one. I don't feel the need to tell you about the book, there are enough other reviews for that, and there is the summary. I will tell you that I was hooked from the first page. I have always been intrigued by women who live with men who abuse them. My mother being one of those women, and my father being one of those men, I had an inside glimpse of life as a child in a situation like that. I found that reading about Kevin's thought process and the way he reasoned let me into a place I'd always tried to figure out. My mom wasn't fortunate enough to find a man as amazing as Alex, but she was able to get away.  I cheered for Katie and cried for her too. My mom has always said, \\"People who love you don't treat you that way.\\" and, \\"Love doesn't hurt.\\"  I thank her for those words everyday, and I try my best to engrain them in my daughter's minds lest they choose a man who \\"loves\\" them into submission. Thanks Nick for another great read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not my favorite J, Grisham novel but interesting reading. My spouse liked it more than I. Will probably buy the next Grisham  offering. B.E.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was utterly enthralled with this book! The universe the author creates is dark and interesting and I could not get enough of it. My only gripe is that the kindle edition I received had minor typos but didn't detract from the incredible story. I cannot wait to delve into book two.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have given this 2 strars because it was so teidious  to get through. The length that it took to get to the final comments were way too long. If writes anything else, I will have to think long and hard about purchasing it
111846446X|5.0|When you purchase a $35 computer you shouldn't expect all the bells and whistles of a more expensive system.  This book is a must have for everyone who has never had any exposure to the RPi. It is more than a user guide that would come with a new computer. It is written by one of the co-creators of the RPi.  It covers everything you need to get started from OS imaging, partition management, program installation, ugrading the OS to Python programming and GPIO usage.  No matter what your intentions are for the Pi you'll benefit from this book.  Of course it doesn't cover everything, and in fact some of the program revisions mentioned in the book are already outdated, but I found the price of $13.03 on Amazon, more than reasonable for what is contained in this book and the outdated program revisions only normal for rapidly changing software.
B002NZK5TG|1.0|YOu guys missed represented this movie as having the alternative/original ending to the film. Please send me instructions on how to send this trash back to you. I have gone from disliking this company from the beginning of 2012 to hating the company 3 days into 2013. The company increasingly terrible and I can not wait for a competitive rival to the market. Before then I'm canceling my PRIME subscription. Yes, hate is an accurate feeling for this company.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is a great CD to listen to year-round. It was my favorite CD to celebrate the holidays with and I am still playing it after they are over. The movie is my all-time favorite too.
B000C25VNM|5.0|I have many versions of the book purchased over the last 25 years and the illustrations/imagery she created in this volume are wonderful.  I would recommend this edition.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I would recommend it to anybody that loves humor, Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, a person finding themselves, and sarcastic humor. This is an amazing movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK! I have never been so into a book before. I personally do not like overly complicated books so this was perfect for me. I didn't have to strain to remember details so they'd make sense later. It's an easy read but it's not bad writing. Bad writing to me is Fifty Shades. This book doesn't seem like it was written by a teenager like that. At first I was kind of skeptical because I didn't want to read another cheesy over the top perfect love story, but this is far from that. It has such a good mix of different moods. One second I think I know what's going on, then BAM the entire scene is turned upside down and you're left not being able to stop reading to see what happens next. It's enthralling and addicting. This is such an amazing book, I'm at such a loss for words. This book will make you smile, make you squeamish, then make you cry all in one sitting.
0240810961|5.0|This book was a gift to my son and he loves it. I find it open every time I enter his room
038533348X|4.0|I read Slaughter House-5 in college and thought it was fun and goofy with a little humanistic existentialism thrown in to give it some depth.  My reaction to Cat's Cradle now is similar, but I had not realized how pessimistically cynical Vonnegut was about our species. Yet, despite his doubt about our worth, Vonnegut did not give up on us.<br /><br />I have admired Vonnegut's personality as much as his writing.  He struggled with depression, but managed to have a brilliant career.  He survived the horror of the Dresden firebombing and turned his horror into inspiration for art.  His Masters thesis was rejected by the University of Chicago, but he forgave the University and became a supporter (after the degree was granted for his literary accomplishments).  He had a love/hate relationship with his hometown, and loved to lampoon and praise Hoosiers and Indianapolis in his books.<br /><br />In my one chance meeting with him, he tousled the hair of my two little boys and took it with grace and pleasure that we didn't know who he was.<br /><br />He once said in an interview that he'd rather laugh than cry, \\"because crying was so much more messy.\\" [[ASIN:B005ECBYAE False Prophet, a Legal Thriller]]
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Second only to Atlas Shrugged of course.<br /><br />Roark is Rand's embodiment of the human spirit, and his struggle represents the triumph of individualism over collectivism.<br />These themes are quickly dying in todays world, this should be a must read for anyone who wants to accomplish something with their life. This book will help you identify those trying to mislead and manipulate you under the guise of altruism.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I bought this for my 3 year old nephew and he loves it. I too enjoy watching it. Fun movie.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I thought this movie was going to suck when I saw the trailer but I gave it a chance and it proved me right. Let me start off by asking what the hell happened to Joseph Gordon-Levitt? The make-up looks awful, was this really necessary? Is he just too young looking for the role, you had do that to him? Anyway, JGL's make-up is the least of this film's problems. First off the whole plot is just ridiculous. Time travel has been invented...but it's been outlawed. Naturally, organized-crime gets their hands on it and since disposing of dead bodies is much more difficult in 2077 then it is in 2044 they must use the time machine to dispose of bodies in the past. What? So they can't get rid of bodies but getting a time machine is a piece of cake? What's worse is the time machine itself, some rusting piece of crap in a dilapidated warehouse? That's the time machine? How did they get it? The movie doesn't even try to explain how it works, Bruce Willis just talks about making diagrams with straws instead. You can tell the writer Rian Anderson didn't even think it through whatsoever. The best part are the cars in the movie, in particular Joe's car. It's 2044 and we're supposed to believe that Joe's line of work pays well yet he's driving a 1994 Mazda Miata? Really? I've never seen lazier film making, they make a little effort to create futuristic vehicles sure but those are even worse. Just about everything you see is straight out of the nineties. They do such a poor job of convincing us that we are in the future, it's just so laughable. So let's get to the story itself. Why do the guys from the future have to die? I would think sending them to the past would be good enough, we never see any FBI or law enforcement being sent to the past in their own machines. Who cares? Who are they hiding them from? Why do they have to kill themselves? It's just stupid, we never see this \\"Rain Maker\\" as an adult in the future and as a kid he's able to move things that aren't even metal when others can only move small metal objects. What? The whole TK thing seems just tacked on for no reason. It's completely meaningless since we never see Sid as an adult anyway. So the older Joe comes back to try to kill Sid so he isn't sent back and his wife isn't shot. Well wouldn't he be sent back to the past regardless of Sid coming to power? Weren't they closing loops before he showed up? The action is terrible, the acting is lame and the plot is just so half-baked that this movie just doesn't work. If you have seen \\"In Time\\" with Justin Timberlake then this will seem familiar as a corny take on a futuristic thriller. Joseph, Bruce and Emily you are all above this crap.
B00005JOA0|3.0|I love reading a book then watching the movie.  I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down.  The movie, in most parts, follows the book except for a few scenes with the young Arthur and the ending.  The movie, in my opinion, could've been better if the story was more developed with her life with her husband besides all the abuse. I found myself very depressed with the movie afterwards.  It is a sad story and they did a good job portraying the abusive husband, but I felt they focused so much on that they left out a lot of the story with other characters from the book.  Of course with a movie this usually happens since it's only a couple of hours long.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 3.5 year old granddaughter loves it. She plays for hours,when we let her. One of her favorite games to play
B001NLKZUA|3.0|The series is very long, and at times hard to read, but the ending was very good, so if you have started the series you should finish it.
B005544TRQ|4.0|A highly entertaining show.  We watched the first season in two days over the christmas break with the family and everyone enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie before I read the book. They're both incredible, can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|realllllllllllllllly cool game it was fun to play and awesome. I loved that's why I give 5 stars. plus its like temple run
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Good 4th installment. Even considering Matt Damon wasn't in this one I was impressed with it. This was a gift nd he was very happy with it.
B005PR44XC|5.0|A well written coverage of the financial crisis in Europe and the USA. I details how the USA needs strong and unselfish management to survive
B002C6A6N6|5.0|We never took the opportunity to watch this movie when it was first introduced on TV.  Now that we have purchased the series we have watched it through and find it a great family film and wholesome entertainment.  Thanks to the Inspiration Channel for getting us interested in this great series.  We love all the actors and how the lives of the community interacted so well.  We are especially appreciative of how the film explains the plight of the Native Americans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun my bro and i both love it a lot<br />its fun to get high scores xD<br />my friend though had an update on hers and got. an NYC version of it!!! I wanna know when that'll happen for me so my bro can be verrry happy. we love the subways a lot. and so.this game is perfect for us xD so I can reccomend.<br />its free too! not much good FREE apps out there but this is one of the only good FREE ones :')
B003EV6DBM|3.0|Bought this for a friend's xmas present and she was pretty ecstatic about it. DVD box was also pretty cool because it had a holographic cover
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big bold keys. Easy functionality. Best calculator. I use this on all of my android and Google based platform. Kudos to the developer.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|This was a 5 star game until your most recent modifiations.  I cannot play online-one on one or in a group any more. No matter what I do to fix the problem, including trying to reset my User name and password, it does not work. I do not play as often because of this.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This product was delivered in a timely manner, came undamaged and was a wonderful watch.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate this movie with four stars, only because I don't find it to be exact as the book. That isn't to say that his movie is a bad movie in any way. As a standalone movie it is a wonderful movie packed with action and interest. I do not recommend this movie for children under the ages of 14. It includes violence, death, and politics. Never a good mix for a preteen let alone a young child. As an adult I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of this dysfunctional utopian society and the story created.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|It was amazing! I loved this movie! Captain america is one of my favorite superheroes! I loved watching this on the kindle with my boys!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Package arrived undamaged, speedily, and had great product. I love this movie for watching with my family and now I can have it on the go thanks to the digital copy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book deserves a 10 out of 10. The story line is well written and you really get to know and love the characters. I would read this book over and over again.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this for a friend and he flipped that it also had the Digital Copy. Great buy, fast delivery, and undamaged product.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I've used this a ton and it has held up pretty well. It's nice and sturdy and fits well on our stroller. We have an Aprica Presto.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|This could have only been better if they had included a digital copy to the purchase. They have digital copy available through vudu for the last movie only and that kinda sucked.
B004LZEV4Q|4.0|I love &#34;Goodnight Moon&#34; and bought this one so my husband can record it before he deploys for me to read to our son while he's gone. I'm still happy I bought it but I was disappointed that the intermittent black and white pages that are in the original are not in this recordable version. That's the only down side.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|The download process was easy and thanks to amazon's great promos I was able to get this album for less than ten bucks!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout video. It has some good intensity and I like that you can workout hard for a short amount of time.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Itunes priced this season at $49.99<br />Vudu priced this season at $39.99 - $49.99 depending on the format<br /><br />Amazon was the best price I saw and I love that it is on the cloud for me so I can watch anywhere!
1844137872|5.0|This is a good compilation of Banksy's stuff. Obviously, if you are a Banksy fan you will like it a lot more than if you aren't. There are a lot of good shots in there.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Great movie and to get it in high def was totally awesome. I enjoyed watching my husband's face light up when he saw this title.
B007RXC3A8|1.0|Let me start this out by saying that, while I am a long-time fan, I do like and appreciate their newer stuff.  I felt that Unia was a solid album and Days had some good songs...but this album was nothing but a disappointment to me.  Look, I know that they will never go back to the style that they were the best at, but does it have to get this s***ty?  The only song I could get behind was \\"Cinderblox\\", and that is only because I am a sucker for a banjo.    In short, there is very little to redeem this crap-hole of an album, and I don't think I will even steal their next album.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My husband lit up like a kid at christmas when he opened this. He was excited to see that it was not only the blu-ray but also a digital copy to watch on the go.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|I've been listening to this album for years and it still gets me to this day.  I love epic music and this album is epic.  Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens is the MVP on this album.  So many good songs are on this album, it's hard to list them all.  The melodies are both catchy and complex.  IE really stepped up their game on this one.
B00632HWOG|1.0|And no I don't mean bugs bunny. This thing never worked for me and I wasn't ever able to make it work. Just a hassle to have
B002N1AERI|5.0|This album takes my breath away.  This is easily their magnum opus.  This album is so rich and amazingly complex, yet it never loses the melody.  There is nothing that I could say in this review that has not been said in other ones on this site.  I just hope that Epica did not blow their creative load on this album, because the album after this was quite a disappointment coming off the heels of such a magnificent masterpiece.  Nevertheless, no matter if the band goes creatively downhill or not, this will always be here as a testament to their incredible, bombastic talent.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie was delivered in a timely manner, was in good condition and had a great feature. I enjoyed the comedic points as well as the romance appeal. This is a great guy/girl movie cause it holds the best of both worlds enough that guys aren't left watching a &#34;chick flic&#34; I actually purchased the soundtrack for this movie and even my husband jams to it from time to time.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a fun hidden objects/puzzle game, but I felt the gameplay was a a little short for the full game price (2.99).
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Great Digital copy for myself and husband. We enjoyed watching it and it came speedy, good condition and great watch.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's great to have a weather channel at my fingertips so I can plan for my day where ever I may be.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is great. You can actually use multiple accounts at once for those who have such things lol. I only say this as an author who wishes her personal and professional lives to be separate.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult is a wonderful author and I really enjoyed reading this book.  I have read one other book by Ms. Picoult, but have ordered several more for my bookshelf, and more downloaded to my Kindal.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Got this app the day I got my kindle, and its been nice to have. want to know if you got enough juice to watch that movie? get this app.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Totally fun.  Always enjoy Zeppelin and it's nice to have a &#34;new&#34; product from this favorite group.  They are the best.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Ok, I never heard of this game but when I saw it was a free game I figured I would try it out. Wow, this is highly addictive and I love it!!
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|Oliver Stone is a genius. The story is well done and acted to perfection. I'm a big fan of films that portray the drug underworld, and highly recomend this film to anyone who likes the same. I will buy this to keep in my library.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|I'm not always sure how WAZE is categorizing things (dirvers, routes, etc), but I'm still happy enough to recommend it.  A time saver, and I love that it can adapt to my own patterns.
1419703692|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and he LOVES it. It is a very large book, &#34;coffee table&#34; sized. It has a nice mix of pictures and description... So, you won't finish it in a day just by browsing through the photos, but you will be able to pause and read about what you are looking at. It is the ultimate gift for any Batman fan.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. Nice graphics. Much better than a lot of other search games on the market today. Keep up the good work
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is Twilight with an over emphasis on disconnected sex.  The person who wrote this should be sued. Don't waste your time.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|This could have been a fun game.  COULD.<br />In gaming devs often make up for a mediocre idea by adding false challenges to the mechanics.  For example, in EDGE, the goal is to guide a block around a board with your finger, tilting your device to make certain areas accessible based on a light physics puzzle.  Let's start with the controls.  In this game, controls are actually rather sporadic, resulting in several &#34;cheap&#34; deaths from the block reacting in ways you may not expect and instead of stopping where your finger rests, simply going one &#34;flip&#34; to far over the edge of the board.  Before you counter needlessly, yes, I am an AVID gamer, yes, I calibrated my touch, and yes, it was simply bad detection.<br />The second issue with this game is the ridiculous &#34;physics&#34; element.  My block at times would not take a step down or up, but was capable of a nearly upside-down mount of a step which a spider would have found challenging on his best day.  The result was a lot of frustration when my poor, helpless block is simply trapped in a corner and I am spinning my device furiously trying to find the angle that unlocks the ability to move.  In the too often cases of this happening I usually found the angle very NEAR where I had started.  Again, increased difficulty due to poor execution is not a good idea, kids.<br />On the plus side, the graphics are very... square.  Pretty, mind you, just square.  Not a lot to see, not a lot going on.<br />Finally, I recognize this may be intended for young audiences.  It seems even then frustration would be par for the course.
B00797MB0O|2.0|i just watched this right now, and i have been wanting to watch it since it came out in theater `s but i am so glad i didnt, it was just that bad!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book was awesome, I never wanted to set it down not even for a min! I can't wait to read the next book.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Disappointed.  It keeps asking for money to advance in the game.  If I had known, I wouldn't have ordered it.
1401937519|5.0|Just read it for the second time.  So much to digest.  So well written.  The fact that the author is a mixture of 3 cultures makes this experience truly unique.
B003PIS6GO|3.0|It was a movie I enjoyed when I was young,there were alot of good movies from the 80's so I wanted to share them!
0802473156|5.0|I first heard about this book when my friend got married and it was required reading for her and her (now husband).  I now see this book mentioned often.  It's a short read, but helps you recognize what you need in a relationship so that you can better verbalize it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I saw the movie first but you couldn't quite capture the depth and thoughts of Katness Everdeen like you did in the book.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I bought it for my 8 year old niece and some family friend's kids 8 and 11 years old. I think adults like this movie more than kids, but they still enjoy it. It arrived on time and in great condition.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Once again this writing team has succeeded in writing another engrossing novel. Prendergast is such an intriguing character surrounded by other well scripted characters. STORY LINE WAS GREAT AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT BOOK WHERE I AM SURE ALBAN WILLRETURN
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great sight for learning all kinds of things. It is easy to use; but be careful for it can be addicting!
B004N66XYE|5.0|I was worried that this gift didn't arrive in time for Xmas because I ordered it so late.  But it arrived before Xmas and was wrapped neatly in a box, which is effortless for me to use it as a gift for my friend.  My friend was so happy that she could cry.  Did I mention that this series is really wonderful to watch?  Thanks so much.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As Harry ages, his charm does not fade. In this latest, there are some new aspects as Harry encounters personal danger that is not often seen. While his &#34;escape&#34; is highly improbable, Connelly makes it plausable. Harry's evolving relatinship with his daughter evokes memories. As always I enjoyed the jazz references.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The price is much cheaper than anywhere else and I received the merchandise very quickly, in time for Xmas.  The recipient was elated that I actually found this video set.  The merchandise came nicely in a box sealed very well.  As always, thanks!
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|Christina can sign anything and it would sound wonderful. Her voice range and the notes she hits<br />is very amazing. Awesome !!!
B003XMKMTQ|5.0|I play guitar and enjoy hearing some of the best players perform in a relaxed venue.  The DVD was the next best thing to being there with the added up close and personal aspects that even those attending could not receive.  Overall it was very enjoyable as were Clapton's 2007 and 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festivals.  If you like wonderful guitar playing, you won't be disappointed in any of the Crossroad DVD's.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help is really a good movie. It takes you back to a time when life was simple<br />but it shows the prejudice. The women in The Help all did wonderful in acting there<br />rolls and were very believable. This is not the case with every movie. I would reccomend<br />this movie to all women and most men.
B000VR824S|5.0|I play guitar and enjoy hearing some of the best players perform in a relaxed venue.  The DVD was the next best thing to being there with the added up close and personal aspects that even those attending could not receive.  Overall it was very enjoyable and is at the same entertainment level as the 2004 and 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festivals.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|The girls came over to watch this movie with me and it was a very fun light<br />movie. You need these types of movies sometimes just to make you laugh.<br />I would reccomend this for any girls night.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This shell is ideal for travel as well as for at home lying in bed. I love it for reading on a long flight.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This has so many good songs on it. Kelly really makes very good music.<br />Most of it is upbeat and I love her energy.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This was a great read for a long plane flight. And the inclusion of gustatory references gave it an additional dimension.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink's music is always great and she did not disappoint me on this CD.<br />It's obvious she sings from her heart, Great CD!!
B00ARAOBKS|3.0|The characters in this movie were so stupid, it made the movie funny. Never thought we'd see Matthew McConnahy in such  a dumb movie. I recommend it to everyone who appreciates dark humor.
1439153663|5.0|My book club group chose this book to read, however, I wasn't thrilled about it at first, but then I got sucked in and couldn't put the book down. Great book and I would recommend!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Great Movie. Bought this just for the digital download. Came as expected, fast shipping. Would love to see the TV show come back!
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|Sorry, I had the real thing so this app doesn't have much of a chance with me.  Can't see paying for more of the same.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I think this app worth every penny for your purchase.<br />Addictive for an afternoon playing and more.<br />Art works are beautiful.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It was so easy at the lower levels.  Then it got diabolical!  We'll see if I can survive to pay for the additional levels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book in so many ways. If there was one book that I would recommend to someone it would be this book.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I can't get enough of these books, and sincerely hope he hurries up with the next two, as I know it won't take me long to blast through \\"Dragons\\".
0375851569|5.0|Don't get me wrong. We read books in our house... and my adult children read to their kids... but this is a good looking addition to any bookshelf. A great collection of Dr. Seuss stories and fun to read for all. Got to get it before it's too late.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The premise was interesting and the movie was well executed. The movie took advantage of Blu Ray quality in only a handful of scenes but was visually stunning nonetheless.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|All I can say is Christian Grey would have to be the most non likeable man in a book I have ever read....this book was read only because I like to finish what I start so my words of advice are don't start the book......
B009GESJH2|1.0|Now on the one hand, you can appreciate anyone's devotion to old school rock n roll...and make no mistake this is OLD school. You could have told me this was from 1971 and I'd have believed you.<br /><br />The problem is, even within its' own context, this is a downright lazy effort. It sounds like the song lengths for each track are the same amount of time Ritchie spent writing them. All the riffs (and song titles for that matter) sounds like stuff you might on a non-album B-side from Lynyrd Skynrd or Ted Nugent. And the Bob Seger fetish is just getting sad at this point. You're from Detroit. We get it.<br /><br />Old hippies and rock n roll heads might enjoy this, but there's not much here for anyone else.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Seriously women of this world, the main character of this book is so unlike-able and I doubt most women would be attracted to a man like this.  The main female character seriously is letting the female race down every where and no I am not a feminist.
B007WOFXAO|5.0|love it and at a great price will tell all my  friends who easy it was to get them :)
B000H7J9RQ|1.0|I love the concert that I wanted a copy of for memories sake.  I can only play this concert on my computer, not in a DVD player, because it has a format for another country. Should have been told this upfront.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|i have always loved the stargate series all of them along with deep space nine and stargate atlantis 1 in HD is great.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Great product. Excellent quality and my fiancé loved it a his Christmas present. He said the only present that would be better would be real led zeppelin tickets.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wonderful read! KING' s story has not only told a great tale of time travel, but has also been a great tale of history.  As always, a wonderful work by my favorite author.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have never seen such a movie so moving and I balled my eyes out!  I am the greatest dog lover ever along with many others I'm sure.  Wonderful movie but a tear jerky.
B003VDZK8K|4.0|I'm an old-school heavy metal guy who grew up listening to Maiden, Priest and Sabbath.  As I got older, I grew out of metal but I still enjoy the older stuff.  Avenged is a band that does the horror schtick that Maiden and Sabbath do, have great musicians (great drums and guitar) and are very melodic.  To me, they are a great modernization of the classic metal sound.
142314189X|5.0|I read the first one in two days! You can't stop reading it! I'm finishing the second right now, very addicting....
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|This is one of those movies that has some great parts to it but, at times, it drags.  Not bad and would recommend if you have no expectations and enjoy raunchy humor.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a good heartbreaking book. I probably cryed while reading the book. I bet the movie will be 10 times better than the first
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|My daughter played this game on her new Kindle Fire she got for Christmas, and her mom and I were happy to allow as we know the product family (LPS) and the app was \\"Free\\".<br /><br />In 1 day, she racked up over $113 in 1 day of playing with this game.  We didn't notice until I checked my billing a day later and discovered this.<br /><br />Amazon customer service was great in helping us disable the in-app purchases and setup more control, but definitely want all parents to be aware of the hidden cost of this game.<br /><br />Be aware.<br />-Brian
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Really enjoyed this romance. It was very modern and also made me want to read more books by the author.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Even though the film may have been advertised a little bit, it was well done and should have been better advertised. Acting was first rate, story was well thought out and interesting..
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Steely Dan fans waiting for new music wait no longer.  As his other solo output has demonstrated, Donald Fagen is the real creative mastermind behind Steely Dan, and \\"Sunken Condos\\" could easily be Steely Dan if Walter Becker were present.  Without insulting Becker, all the magic that makes Steely Dan such a long lasting tradition in pop music is present here, so you're not missing anything.<br />  I always get a two sided view when dealing with Fagen/Steely Dan.  On the one hand, and the reason I love them, nobody has done a better job of keeping the smoothest jazz alive and well in a very deep pool of musical influence that at once melds jazz, funk, rock and maybe a hint of blues.  It's music so cool that you become a cooler person just by listening.  I borrow that line from Lamb Of God's Randy Blythe, who said the same thing about Mastodon's song \\"Curl of the Burl\\", because it fits.  On the other hand, through no fault of their own, sometimes I can imagine some white collar rich bastard executive desperate to appear hip and cool playing Steely Dan to impress the dollface next to him in his Mercedes he's probably paying at least $600 a month for to lease.  There is that undeniable urban \\"cool\\" that marks all Steely Dan and Fagen solo material, and it isn't hard imagining hearing their music cruising up the Sunset Strip or down 5th Avenue at night on a rain slicked street.  Makes you kind of want to start smoking and buy a fedora.<br />  Snide comments aside, \\"Sunken Condos\\" is a bit more lively than Steely Dan's last effort \\"Everything Must Go\\".  The horn section is quite impressive and the funk is more present, especially when Fagen covers Isaac Hayes' \\"Out of the Ghetto\\".  Sonically \\"Sunken Condos\\" for me is more reminiscent of \\"Nightfly\\", and that is a good thing, because I found \\"Kamakiriad\\" to be a little off.<br />  There are no real surprises here, just Fagen's usual brilliance both musically and lyrically, keeping real \\"cool\\" alive so we can admire it if we can't actually replicate it.e can't actually replicate it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun app! Keeps me from being bored during commercials and when the power is out and when I need to be \\"quiet \\".<br />Thanks Amazon.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I would had liked more background on all the heroes! Specially the guy with the arrows! But overall a good movie!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A double u  . e  . some! What a triumphant  heart warming story.<br />A wonderful read for anyone of any age.
B004I1K2NW|5.0|If you like Michael J Fox movies, I highly recommend this one. I loved the irony in this movie and the humor.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Great fun hidden object game.  Nice back story.  You can skip the story and jump into the game.  Flashlight scenes are a little tricky. Moving around the screen in magnified mode can cost you points also.  All in all a great game.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This was a better deal without the movies vs. the set with the movies. Purchased movies separately. If you are a fan of the shows then you need this set in your collection.
B005EPFA8I|4.0|The subject matter was very interesting and the photography was excellent.  It was amazing to see all of the scientific effort that has gone into analysing the cave and the paintings.  There was so much more than just seeing cave paintings.
B0041KVXLK|3.0|How I wish that all the songs on this album were as good as \\"A Day in the Life.\\" I remember back in 1967 when everyone couldn't wait for the new Beatles album. I think the \\"long wait\\" made people nutty and obfuscated their criticism. What shocked about this album back then was the sheer sound of it. Sounds no one ever heard before! Backward tapes! Cleverly mic'd drums! Granted, the production of \\"Pepper\\" deserves five stars; it literally changed the way music would be recorded from then on. But, ah, there are more weak tracks here than strong ones. I'm more of a fan of early Beatles, but the inclusion of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" would have improved the record, no doubt about that one. So, this is the watershed album everyone was waiting for, yes, but the Beatles usually created trends, not overtly follow them (read psychedelia). Oh heck, it's only one record. Weak by Beatle standards. Which are high. And is it only me who thinks that \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is one of their strongest records? Pop perfection. The Beatles got certain things out of their system and bounced back with \\"The White Album.\\" So it's not like they were washed up or anything.
0525953728|5.0|I love the way this book was written.  A great account about what our heroes go through and do to protect us!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my first book on new Kindle fire and having seen the movie I did not expect my reaction.  I could not put this down!  It is so well written and. The story line so compelling..... I loved it, thank you to my granddaughter for recommending this.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Best game ive played on my kindle by far! Totally addicted from the moment I started playing it! I recommend this for everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it! Leaves nothing to question. One of the best series I have ever read. Let's hope the movies get better.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This was a total surprise for my husband and he was thrilled with it. He is enjoying his range finder!
B0049VZ222|5.0|Love this series - I heard good things but expected a so so zombie story - my expectations were exceeded - the storyline is compelling and the special effects are terrific - even got my wife into it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I bought the Kindle version of this book & I hope someday to purchase the book itself. I haven't found myself lost in a book for a very long time, but this book made me feel like I was the one traveling back in time & I was unable to put it down! I absolutely loved it & highly recommend it to anyone if they are not a Stephen King fan because it is truly different then his other works. Excellent read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend this book to ages 15 and up.  I didn't want to put the book down.  I can't wait to see the movie.
0156027321|5.0|Not at all what I expected, and I have to admit, I love a book that leaves you wondering and it's up to you to decide what's 'true'.  Fascinating approach!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Was skeptical and hesitant to even begin watching this show because i thought the whole idea was a completete joke and cliche of the times today because of video games. Figured it was a waste of good time watching this senseless teenage video game type of gorey mindless madness. But i ended up seeing a couple episodes from afar because my roommate would watch it and then i was hooked! Now i have marathoned the first two seasons and this third season looks to be getting even better. Don't start watching this if you don't plan to get hooked and spend hours and hours devoted to watching this highly addictive show. It's great and i can't wait for more!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Stayed up later than intended to finish this one off--didn't want to put it down. A little corny in some areas, but overall a fun, well-moving read.
B008M34INW|5.0|This is a great movie, a great story with plenty of twists and quite humorous as well.  Too bad it was not released in theaters.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|My Grandchildren loved it and  so did I. It was a great story with a wonderful ending.I recommend this video.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|GRipping and exciting Couldn't put it down and read all three volumes in quick succession. Wonderful storytelling and vivid mind pictures throughout
B00ARAO720|3.0|The movie in itself was enjoyable.  What my primary complaint is about the quality of the picture.  I have noticed that when I rented movies from Amazon, the quality was 4 stars.  Recently, when renting movies, the movie will start playing, then stops and 'loads'.  I can see the quality drop from 4 to 1.  I use a Roku box to stream movies.  The quality of one star sucks.  The movie is blurred and pixelated, the sound is borderline garbled.  This issue does not happen when watching Netflix.<br />I think Amazon should look into this issue.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Easy to read and interesting story.  It made me think about how easily this sort of thing could happen in our own time.  Mr. Howley has a creative and expressive writing style.  I look forward to reading more installments of the series.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I recently became a fan of the tv show, &#34;Firefly&#34; by viewing it on Hulu. The show was well written and acted. Sadly,after only 14 episodes, the show was cancelled in 2002. So, I was happy to find that a movie was released in 2005 to contiue the story and end the series as well. Hopefully, fans of &#34;Firefly&#34; got some closure to a great show. I enjoyed the movie, tho, I wish the series could have continued.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very interesting and amusing book.  It was a book I couldn't wait to finish. Very good reading. Thank you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Every entertaining reading, I find myself mad with the characters, laughing with them, not understanding them at time.  This is a good read for me.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is like a portable WoW game. if you don't know what wow is look it up under blizzard games online. man if the graphics get that good then blizzard arts has compaction:).
B004QSQML8|5.0|Fast delivery.  This is one of my favorite fantasy films and I was happy to find a copy with Tangerine Dream doing the soundtrack.  Their music really makes the movie.
B00846REIS|4.0|Quick read, fun storyline that never gets dull. Great sexual relationship between the main characters!<br />Similar to 50 Shades series though better written.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Hard to manipulate on my gTablet.  I am also not sure the full scene for each level loaded properly, causing me to miss completing several levels.  After a while, it gets tedious, but the first two &#34;seasons&#34; were a riot to play.  Highly recommend it despite the shortcomings [which I think are machine realted].
B009HEJXFS|1.0|Cant rview because after 3 hours of trying and 2 call to cust service cancelled. Wouldnt download even though i have dowloaded before
B000002LND|5.0|Im glad I purchased this madonna immaculate cd. The old school memories and upbeat music revives my mind and soul. It just reminds me of my old friends and our song days together.
B00979CS50|5.0|I have been a Neil Young fan since I was in elementary school with &#34;Heart of Gold&#34; off old am pop stations.  As I went into H.S. and college I discovered all that was available from CSN&Y to everything Neil and had even been to concerts.  Have loved the poetry of the lyrics and the jam sessions were tops.  Have great understanding of why recent (Bush years) recordings were so raw and had to be, but WOW-Psychedelic Pill gives one a great trip!!  It makes a listener really feel the spirit of being young again. No pun here.  It's super.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Bought this doll for my 2 year old granddaughter. Perfect size for her to hold. The doll's eyes close when you lay her down. Nothing else. I was looking for a doll that would fit a 2 or 3 years olds play routine. Didn't want one that drank, or wet, or made noise. This is perfect. Beautiful baby, little cap comes off but slides back on. My granddaughter easily carries her around. We use one of her old infant blankets for the doll. Could not be happier with this choice.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I bought this book this morning!  Literally...couldn't put it down!  Finished it the same day!  Very good read and would recommend it to anyone looking for a very fast paced, edge of your seat page turner.  Yes...like some reviewers...figured it out half way through...but didn't see the side-swipe that the author fast pitched at the very end!  I'll buy more from this author!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A brilliantly descriptive story. Imaginative and full of amazing detail. Am very intrigued to see the movie now. Will most likely read again.
0762434279|4.0|I hope my daughter will read this book and learn now instead of like me reading it and reflecting back.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was such a charming movie - the characters were wonderful - I could totally relate to the sunset of life
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I really like playing this game.  It is new to me.  My granddaughters told me I needed this on my Kindle.  They seem to know everything about electronics.  It is fun to play.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This is a classic nothing to say about that.  The narration was well done by wonderful performers and it brought back some of what hollywood can't reproduce
B007MJSQSK|4.0|I gave this 4 stars, because we thought it was a kid movie, and it definitely wasn't. This was an adult movie. Full of adventure and very good. My husband and I enjoyed watching it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All the movies are contained within a slender box! Easy to store and keep track of. Was a great price too!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|\\"The perks of being a wallflower\\" was Different, refreshing, and real. Worth reading! I would recommend it to almost anyone.
1878424319|5.0|Our personal power is based on the agreements we make, and often we make those agreements to please others, rather than being true to ourselves. In doing so, we give away our personal power. The Four Agreements is about taking back our personal power by being authentic and by adhering to our true selves. The four agreements are: 1) Be impeccable in your word, 2) Don't take anything personally, 3) Don't make assumptions, and 4) Always do your best. While simple, these agreements are anything but easy. Ruiz encourages readers to practice these agreements everyday and forgive ourselves when we are not perfect. The effort is what's most important. This book is a quick read (or listen) and should be reread repeatedly if you truly desire to keep your agreements with yourself.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Awesome movie on 3D with great surround sound and come at you 3D graphics! Worth every penny to own it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I chose this book a few years ago because I thought I should read it. I didn't. Now that I've finally picked the thing up, however, I can't put it down. Not too shabby for a factual history book, right? And, unlike my college American History texts, this one is intriguing and memorable, sharing insight far beyond what could be reasonably expected.<br /><br />The author put in a solid mountain of work on this fat volume and it's clear that she thoroughly loves her subjects. Doris Kearns Goodwin is my new hero.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Cant stand pop ups. Deleting it now! I bought the kindle with out the adds for a reason. What a nuisance.
0425252868|5.0|Simply put, a must read. Just an amazing story that once you start you cannot put down. Buy this book, you won't be sorry that you did!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Trouble With The Curve is has a good story line which I enjoyed very much.  Clint Eastwood gives another outstanding performance.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Very clever, well written, might have had to love racing more than I did, but metaphors to life were fun, and characters lovable, especially the dog!
0199573204|5.0|Of the various translations of the Meditations, I think this is the best.  The Loeb translation, while excellent, uses archaic English - lots of &#34;thee&#34; and &#34;thou&#34; and, for me this distracts.  This translation combines the excellence of the content with ease of reading.
B007HACDLK|5.0|always like vince flynns books--exciting to see what the main actor is up to--rather imaging a lot could be close to real happenings !!  the last man
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Well crafted, but a little unbelievabl : (1) That She could dfefeat the lie detector, and (2) that she she could so easily accept tgher villans statemernts.
1400032717|5.0|I love it!  I have a little angel in my life that has Autism and there is a lot of things that now thanks to this book I understood.<br />For sure I hardly recommend this book, because is so helpful on our daily life.
B004AUNSX2|3.0|I don't want to see Ryan Gosling in a role like this.  this movie is kind of dark.  It's just ok
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Ended up buying this movie. Very funny.<br />Sometimes the way they talk and what they talk about could seem harsh to some people. If you are a person like that, that can't take some hardcore humor (family guy style) then don't watch it.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I like Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  I liked this movie, it could have been better but I gave it 4 out 5.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Without Van Damme this movie would have been super boring. You actually are waiting to see him because he plays a convincing villain. Of course they were not going for an Oscar but even for an action movie it's only ok.<br />Worth seeing adn only liked it because Van Damme rocked this one.<br />Staham is always good. Schwarzenegger sucked and some of the others as well.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|It's a cute movie that comes together in the end.  It helps when Ryan Gosling has his shirt off.  wow!!
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|Without Tom Cruise this movie would have been in the theaters 2 days instead of 3. He plays the rocker really well and sounds the best singing the songs. Too much singing throughout the movie in my opinion.<br />Julianne Hough sounds like a chipmunk, pretty lame.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I love this type of movie.  It was<br />done very well. my service from amazon was great. Thor is a good movie to watch and enjoy.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Good effects but that's it. I'm getting a bit tired of effects driven movies.<br />In the end no real conclusion after all the mess that happened in the film. Nough said.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I really like this series. I hate it didn't last longer. Kristen Bell is a good actress, best of luck to her.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I love this book and I have suggested it to several people.  It talks not only about habit in individuals but habits developed by companies and how that has changed their workforce.  Very interesting and helpful if you are trying to change some bad habits that you have.  I would definitely recommend.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I love this series, I hope they come out with more like this.  I wonder what all Veronica could have done if just given the chance?
0156027321|5.0|I loved the story; from the extreme conditions and setting of the story, the imaginative and descriptive powers of the writer and his ability to put himself in the shoes of a shipwreck survivor as if he had really lived it himself.
B004JK61K0|3.0|I'm using this app on my Kindle Fire.  It's ok, I can read my email when I am away from home and that was the main purpose for my getting it.  I had another app and it did not work well at all.  But I can't view all pictures that are sent to me.  So it's just ok for me.  Maybe it's not meant to be used on a Kindle Fire, but I don't really know.
