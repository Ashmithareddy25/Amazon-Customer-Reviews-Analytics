B00AECGQF2|4.0|This is one of the cutest, funnest apps I've ever played. I'm a adult and this application is fun for me. It would be perfect if youccould keep your photos inside the app in a album instead of your cameras folder. Also, if you could change the clothes and faces. Great fun for all of the family!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Brilliant, richly dense, characters who will haunt your dreams. Find a comfortable chair and some uninterrupted time. Worth every minute.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|I did not finish the whole movie. I like Daniel Craig as James Bond, but could not<br />get past the unbelievability (if there is such a word), that James Bond's only response<br />to &#34;M&#34;'s (Dame Judy Dench) allowing the sniper to take the shot that could have<br />resulted in Bond's death was to associate her name in a word identifying test as &#34;BITCH&#34;.<br />Her rationale for allowing the sniper to take the shot was the typical politician's egalitarian<br />concept to sacrifice one for the good of all. I also thought the stunts were exceptionally<br />good but too many of them were too soon in what I saw of the movie. From what I did see<br />of the movie, it was rich in stunts/ graphics and poor on script and storyline.
B00871C09S|5.0|I like anything with Jimmy Stewart, and I think that this is one of the best pictures ever made. But I feel the same way about Flight of the Phoenix, and Vertigo.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|As fine as Sarah Jarosz's previous recordings have been, the young singer/songwriter/mandolinist has truly found herself on her new album. There's no touch here of Bonnie Raitt-, Alison Krauss- or Neko Case-wannabe on Build Me Up From Bones (Not that there's anything wrong with wanting to be any of those great singers, and Ms. Jarosz can flatter them better than just about anybody). But there's no imitation here. Ms. Jarosz' voice is as pure and original as it is powerful and seductive, even when she's covering other songwriters.<br /><br />The album's arrangements are impeccable throughout. And while she has outstanding accompaniment from Chris Thile, Victor Krauss, Jerry Douglas and others, Ms. Jarosz may be at her very best on &#34;The Book of Right-On, when accompanied only by her regular trio members -- Alex Hargreaves on violin and Nathaniel Smith on cello.<br /><br />Build me Up From Bones is a stellar album from start to finish, and should firmly establish Sarah Jarosz and her band at the pinnacle of alt-country and &#34;new grass.&#34; A must-have album, in my opinion!
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|This is a great recording. I still have the original LP, but only my stereo in the garage plays the old LPs so this is great for the house and car.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very simple calculator, that is so very easy to use. I do not like math to well, so i need something easy and quick. This app is perfect for non-math gurus like moi. Anyway, as i said, very good, app. Only complaint is I dislike the comercials.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|An interesting mix of history and legal proceedings that are wonderfully wove together by a lawyer with a deep appreciation of both.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Best mouse I have ever had. The weights are  really nice in making the feel just right. This was also a great value compared to others.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I love it! it is so useful because I being a musician need lyrics all the time! it does sometimes make u wait but other than that its great!! I highly recomend this app to anybody who needs specific papers right now!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved everything about this book.  It was very sad at the end and the story switched between two points of view which might make things a little difficult to understand but otherwise it was a great read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Confession: I am a 33 year old black woman who reads Young Adult fiction. I read other genres, but this is one I love most. I am not the intended audience, as the protagonists are usually teenagers or in their mid twenties, white and in most cases inexplicably unaware of their own unrealistic beauty. I am not the intended audience for YA fiction because they are usually experiencing what I've already lived through: first love, first heartbreak, the uncertainty and infinite possibilities of growing up. I rarely write reviews of books, because though I may be reading the same novel as someone else, my experience of the work is as unique and personal to me as those first moments of waking when things become real again and you are left to discern the meaning of it all. I read YA fiction because the intended audience is not always as self-absorbed and unaware as their elders would be led to believe. Not all YA fiction is created equal, but I read it in the hopes of discovering works like these that make me laugh, cry, feel deep anguish, fall in love, despair, reminisce, hope, fear oblivion, and embrace the unknown. I fell in love with two fictional characters: Augustus Waters, because he was so devastatingly handsome -- obviously -- and because he determinedly decided not to \\"deny himself the simpler pleasures of existence,\\" the least of which was falling in love with a terminally ill girl, which he did so with great aplomb. And Hazel Grace, as Augustus so affectionately refers to her, has the kind of intelligence, humor, audacity for living, and self-awareness not often found in most adults, present company NOT, excluded. No wonder Augustus (I refuse to call him Gus) would fall in love with her.<br /><br />My assessment of the book, I know, is incomplete, but with things that you love, it is sometimes hard to adequately express why you love something (and to quote Augustus, \\"my thoughts are stars that I can't fathom into constellations.\\"). I loved this book. I am so sadit took me so long to read it. I will read other books and most likely become fuzzy on the details of The Fault in Our Stars, but that will not diminish the fact that this is probably my favorite book that I've ever read. I've not gone an hour from finishing this book and I already miss Augustus and his Hazel Grace. One of John Green's characters states, \\"You do not immortalize the lost by writing about them. Language buries, but does not resurrect,\\" -- and I will, respectfully, have to disagree with this statement.<br /><br />I can sometimes experience shame in the fact that I read YA fiction, but it is writing like John Green's that makes it safe for me to say that for whatever embarrassment I may continue to feel (though it has diminished significantly with the reading of this book) I will never stop reading it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|We purchased this DVD to replace the VCR recording we had previously.  The music is absolutely great and George Clooney is a riot.  If you have never seen it you will find it is one of those movies that you never tire of watching.
B007QJBHRS|4.0|Great just to watch these great actors perform.  Recommend it to all Doris Day and Cary Grant fans!  Enjoy! Timeless.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|Best game ever get this app now it's free so give it a try<br />Your kids will love it. GET IT NOW.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this thing. Easy install and works like a charm.  You need good internet service (wifi) for it to function smoothly, but I would guess that's the same with any streamer.  They do need to upgrade it with more capability.  For example, I use Amazon streaming which isn't directly available on the dongle, however, since you can stream right from your laptop, tablet or phone, it is somewhat a mute point.Small and sexy.
0385537131|5.0|I am a great fan of John Grisham's books and this one held my attention from  front to back.<br /><br />It was nice to be able to relate to the familiar characters.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I am watching the movie right now and despite the fact that the audio keeps going in and out I like the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|it's great when it works.  it's been very glitchy and lagging.  now it's stopped working entirely.  very disappointed.  thank goodness for the warranty.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Like temple run but way way way better. The one problem is they need less adds. Once I accidentally clicked on one and it took me to app store. Then went back to game and stuck on loading icon. So just FYI.......watch out for the adds
B00DW1WR14|5.0|As a major Pearl Jam fan, I completely love this album.  Starts off with killer rocking tunes, transitions into some great ballads n love songs.  Highly recommended!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great story lines! The characters continue to grow and the story just keeps getting better and better!!  The twists and plots are unexpected and fun.  The intrigue and suspense is captivating.<br />I LOVE how it is different from the film and have a hard time deciding which is better!  This final book was hard to put down.  And it is a little sad that the story is done!<br />I'm so glad the author went back and wrote the &#34;Bree&#34; book - it was really interesting to get the details behind the young army and how that horde was assembled.  Short easy read, but I can see how including it in the regular book would have been distracting.<br />Anyway - this book is well worth the time and is great fun to read.  Very satisfying ending.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Best headphones ever made as far as I can tell.  Sure, they don't have a giant hip logo on the side, but for me they feel pleasantly retro and have great sound.<br /><br />The packaging doesn't seem to have changed in decades and it feels extremely wasteful by modern standards.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|I have watched this movie many times. My friend hadn't seen it, so I decided to buy it since my streaming options at that time were not very good. (That has changed now since I use a Roku and AppleTV most of the time.) This is the David and Goliath story of the little guy who, but sticking with something and being a bit creative, takes down the previously untouchable giant. I think one of the things that gives this movie its appeal is no one is squeaky clean - everyone has a very human side which includes human flaws. This lends it a lot more realism and an ability to relate to the characters. Also, who doesn't wish someone would be in their corner when you really need them to be? We all love idealism, yet so few of us actually possess it. A must watch.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|if I could save music downloaded from the amazon cloud onto my 64 gb SD card this would be a five star review.  I don't even care about moving the app itself to the SD card.  I just need space for tunes.  I only have 8gb on my Droid Razr M.  I got over 30gb of music i'd like to take with me.  SD functionality please?!?!<br /><br />If I constantly had access to wifi or 4g internet I&#34;d be totally fine with you using the cloud all the time...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just before the movie came out, I started hearing about these books from every nook and cranny that held people. Finally I decided I would treat myself. I had just received a new Nook (sorry Amazon. It was a gift.) I planned on getting the series but it was much more expensive on B&N so I read it on a tablet with the Kindle reader instead. (Thankfully now I have a Kindle.) These books were all ones that I had trouble putting down. They might be aimed towards teens/young adult level, but they are smart and intricate and well written enough for every age level to enjoy. I have to say that I am so very glad I read these books before seeing The Hunger Games movie. As usual, there is more detail in the book that gives the story a bit more punch. Liked the movie too, don't get me wrong, but the books as a step above.
0385535147|4.0|Not his best but a good read overall. So glad he is now getting his style back with the new book &#34; Sycamore Row&#34; Which was probably his best in years.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The story line itself was very good, but would not rate the 5  stars rating but the way the author told the story, his choice of words and how he strung them together was more than enough to make the total package worth 5 stars.
0385537131|5.0|Thsi was the best book in a very long time from John Grisham.  I found it interesting how you could look back at different characters since A Time To Kill and see what had happened to them. Just a great book and I loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like the option of projecting stuff from my laptop to a full screen tv, but I don't do it very often since I have netflix and hulu plus.  I don't use this as much as I thought I would.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to see this was finally on Kindle. Now to get Pet Rescue and I'll really be happy!!
B005V20JKI|5.0|This game is addictive and super fun! You Morph into a bunch of different characters that have special skills. collect muffins to level up. I have played this on many different platforms and it gets challenging. I hope the get more levels and characters.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works well, the plastic kind of disappointed me, but it does it's job. Very lightweight and nice that you can manually sharpen it with a diamond tip.
B00DKY4NBA|4.0|I have been following Arctic Monkeys since their first US tour, and I really enjoy this album. I love being able to listen to an entire album without wanting to skip, and that's true here. I can't quite give it five stars as I would like there to have been some more raw sounding songs, but as is true about each of their albums, their sound continues to evolve. There is a nice mix of energy and calm here, songs to shout too, songs to reflect with, and some that are just downright sexy.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Not boring nor the best game ever. But certainly a very decent and a very fun game to play every now and then.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun and entertaining just got started can't wait to see what's next.animals look good and graphics are good.<br />Game is geared toward younger ones.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|you get to see people's photos, read about them, check out their interests and sometimes chat with them.  it's something to look into to meet people.
B008PZZUTS|4.0|great movie with a lot of twist and turns. recommend for an enjoyable exciting movie..De Niro at his best again
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Had been wanting to watch this for years.  As everyone says, it is timeless!  I've heard about the actors for years but was just young enough to have missed them in their heyday!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|What's to say????? It's candy crush. Every one knows the deal. Just wish there were more lives or it didn't talk 30 minutes to reload, but doesn't everyone
B00CATSONE|4.0|I saw the movie and wanted to read the book. This man was brilliant and loved what he was able to do. Sad that others took advantage of him. The book is great though.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Same thing about the update , won't let me play it either.I AM VERY MAD , I LOVE THIS GAME AND I WANT TO PLAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|Works so well, I even bought another one for our second stroller. It holds water bottles and other necessities so that they are within easy reach. I like that the bottom is flat, so your water bottles don't swing around or hang at odd angles (like other stroller organizers that don't have a frame). Everything is easy to get in and out of it too. Very happy with my purchase.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is unlike any other where you choose your scene.  The options are fantastic where as you don't need to purchase apps to continue.  Finding hidden objects that morph or duplicate is fun while trying to solve the mystery.  I recommend this game for people with patience.  I love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover can really spin a compelling story!!!  Her characters come to life and you want to know their story!!!  This book was hard to put down.  There are twists and turns I didn't expect and I had to keep reading, to see what happened.
B009J2VR3Y|2.0|All tracks skip.  I am aware I did not purchase a new item, but this is the first time I receive a damaged one.  Not happy at all.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Some time people can wish they could live forever.Why is that?.We all want just a little more time. So make the best of it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I enjoyed this game. It was challenging without being impossible. Only has 10 levels right now. Got  through all of them in a very short amount of time.
B003L77G06|5.0|Loved Season One and this Season is just as funny....I will definately be ordering Seasons 3 & 4!!! This is absolutely the funniest show I have seen in years....love it!!
B009AMANH4|1.0|blue ray causing color streaks every couple of minutes.  Movie itself was too slow with sound fluctuations that were distracting.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Never in a million years did I think I would enjoy a show about zombies but I am absolutely addicted to this show!!! The characters are believable and I find myself on the edge of my seat through each episode.....cant wait to see what is gonna happen next!! I bought Season One just to see if I would even be interested and have since bought 2 & 3 and cant wait til Season 4 to find out what happens to all my favorite characters. Highly recommend this show to anyone that likes drama, action & suspense!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer. Very entertaining and every 4 to 5 weeks we are in a different place. I just wish there wasn't so many yutani to get. It seems like forever to get them. But other then that I rate this game a 5 star. Take us to different states as well. That is my 1 request.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I haven't laughed this hard at a tv show in years.....absolutely hysterical!!!! Love this show!!!! The characters are spot on and the situations believable....if you want to laugh til your tummy hurts this is the show to watch!!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|U can save a lot of people from the dumbest ways it is super funny to i totally recamend this app also try dumb ways to live i have lots of lafhgs with this game
B008QMMEOE|1.0|This puzzle was not interest in g enough for my grandson it needs a lot more going on  to keep the little ones interested
B00C0ALZ0W|3.0|Not much I didn't know already do to my own experiences and observations...fun, reminder, but nothing radically inspiring, like Rework.  I love 37 signals' innovative apps, but books not so innovative.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|First time I've played this game and have found it very entertaining not getting bored with it as it has so many different levels of puzzles would recommend this app .well just finished this game and I loved apart from all the talking as you wait to get to the next level I just kept tapping through the. Talking . Would love to play another game of this type but wish it was a bit longer
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This CD is sanctioned by E. L. James herself.  All the classical pieces referenced in the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy of books are included in this CD.  Put the CD on and sit back and read and listen.  A great CD of classical music.  You can picture Christian and Ana.
B00C2UUDMG|3.0|I read all the Mickey Haller novels one after the other in a very short time, curious about the author after watching The Lincoln Lawyer. They were all very nice reads and I had great expectations for this one. I even started reading the Harry Bosch novels while waiting for it, but I really like the legal drama genre.  The Gods of Guilt wasn't a disappointment in itself. The story is solid, there's a constant build up of tension and some &#34;aha&#34; moments, and for those who enjoy the genre, has interesting legal-drama moments too. However, during the whole book I had this feeling that Connelly wrote it with a sequel for The Lincoln Lawyer film in mind, and I never had the same feeling on the previous three books, even though the movie was based on the first one, and those were the actual sequels to it. I was constantly being draw away from the story and thinking about the real world events that led to choices in the story, and that's not something I want when I read a cheap paperback novel for entertainment. This is not The Gulag Archipelago.  The Gods of Guilt is a decent read and was well worth the wait, but Connelly is definitely changed.  UPDATE  Apparently I missed the acknowledgements section, where Connelly thanks the producers of the Lincoln Lawyer for their suggestions on this book. I guess my feeling that this was intended as the sequel to the movie was right.   Just a few points to illustrate what I'm talking about.  SPOILERS   - The book brings back characters from the first book, that weren't in the other three books. Earl, the driver; Gloria, the prostitute who's always in trouble and snitches on the drug dealer; Lankford, the detective who investigates Frank/Raul Levin's murder; Valenzuela, the bail bondsman, etc. That by itself isn't a problem with the story, but if you have seen the movie, as you read the book you're constantly reminded of the actors playing the characters, and that feels different because your imagination doesn't play the samerole it does while reading the other books.  - Bryan Cranston had a very minor role in the movie, playing Det. Lankford. Between then and now, he became an acclaimed actor with his work on Breaking Bad. Not surprisingly, the character has a major role in this book, but it's so cliché to the point of being obnoxious. As I read the book I'm constantly imagining the writer thinking how cool Bryan Cranston was playing Walter White in Breaking Bad, and how to get him to do something similar in this story.  - Maggie MacPherson, played by Marisa Tomei, is almost completely absent from the book, and this is justified by events that happened between books. That feels really strange, because their troubled relationship was one of the most interesting parts of the other books, the way they are still madly in love with each other, but can't work around their professional differences. In the middle of the book I realized she was almost completely absent, then I couldn't stop thinking that was probably because the production had some problem with her during the first movie and she would be unlikely to sign for a sequel.  There's nothing inherently wrong with the book, and someone who never saw the movie probably won't feel the same.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Having read &#34;Bared To You&#34; and loved it, I could not wait to read this 2nd book in the &#34;Bared To You&#34; trilogy.  I was not disappointed.  I continued to follow the story.  Love Sylvia Day's writing and again, look forward to the 3rd book &#34;Reflected In You.&#34;  As I said before, if you liked &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34;, you should begin reading the &#34;Bared To You&#34; Trilogy of books.
B00632HWOG|1.0|These jerks did an automatic download and used up my 3 Gigs plan on the first day of my billing cycle-WTF yosuck yahoo
B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia Day was a &#34;new&#34; writer to me.  I was told if you liked the &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy&#34;, one would also like the &#34;Bared To You&#34; Trilogy of books.  They were right.  Like Fifty Shades, I could not put this book down.  Sylvia Day writes similarly with some of the same phrasing of E. L. James.  I could not wait to read the next book in the Trilogy, &#34;Reflected In You&#34;.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I gave this story 4 stars because towards the conclusion the manner in which Zusak ended Liesel' s story was confusing. First her family was dead,then true author bounced around to Frau Steiner, then to others in Molching in a scattered way.  The book was very gripping and was impossible to put down once I got into the story of Liesel and her foster family during WWII.  Recommend this story to those who are history buffs and are fascinated by the Jewish tragedy of the Holocaust.
B00GNIWFC4|1.0|Wordy episode ever.  We usually enjoy this show but this episode was just terrible. I hope this isn't the trend
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|When this was first advertised in the theaters I was livid. A remake of one of my favorite horror movie franchises, CAN'T BE!!<br /><br />I did not see it in the theaters, I did NOT rent it on DVD or Blu-Ray, I did NOT get it from Netflix, I did however watch it on Halloween because I was bored and thought it would be a good chance for me to cut it up the next day. BOY WAS I WRONG!<br /><br />First although it is billed as a re-envisioning of the original it actually plays out very well as a distant sequel. I am not going to go into details about the plot etc.. but as a HUGE horror movie fan I found myself actually having to turn it off in places because it freaked me out so much. In other parts I was gritting my teeth with some of the gory details of the special effect. That and an amazing story make this my third favorite in the Evil Dead series, yes even above Army of Darkness.<br /><br />When I found out it was produces by both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell I just said NO WONDER!
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|After watching this I thought about the two times I went to Sea World in the early and late 90s. It made me sick because I remember enjoying it so much. I had no idea what was really going on and how these majestic creatures are being mistreated. This should be required viewing before considering going to Sea World. You need to know what you are paying for and supporting.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Because you should be able to use all types of phones.  I have xfinity and I pay enough money I should be able to view tv where ever I gox
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The first time j download this app it freeze on me so I delete it an down . Load it again it is great
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|This is a neat product by Anker. It's always good to have an extra port in the car for someone to charge their phone, iphone or not, without having to hog up another 24V receptacle.
1452126607|5.0|son luved this calendar...ordered new ones for 2015
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Inspiring and a masterpiece.  Truly a life-changing film.  Ben Kingsley's performance is outstanding, and the way the story highlights small details of Gandhi's life is beautiful.
B007L6VR12|3.0|Sweet, quirky, funny and innocent love story of a capable, nerdy pre-teen and his capable though-violent-when-pressed lady love. Female character played similarly to the female character in the Royal Tennebaums, which I also liked. Very good acting. Took me a few minutes to adjust to the fake looking sets, but forgot about it once I focused on the characters.  I like this director's work, highly individualistic, and I usually find his films interesting. Rate 3 and a half stars.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Great Action pact film. Typical James bond - Action and Pretty women everywhere... I still prefer the original Sean Connery but hey
0452289963|5.0|very nice, I like it, It is what I expect. The quality is very good. ^_^ I like it .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book to read, glad I got a chance to read it and ready for the next. Definitely recommend it.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|it was a gift for my husband for our 27 years married he said I hit it right on the head .thanks
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual Grisham keeps you captivated with twist and turns.  I can't wait for his next book. When will that be?
B004HMQ7BI|4.0|I didn't care for the psychic portion of the movie, which was in the beginning, but otherwise I liked this movie a lot.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book keeps you flipping pages.  Very good read.  I loved how all of the stories just barely tied together.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Really good read.  With current issues in our house this really hit home and will provide some ongoing guidance and should be beneficial to all of us in the house.  Give it a read, well with it.
B0000DZ3IG|2.0|I am sorrily disappointed. I wanted so much more of Craig Armstrong's beautiful,tender Glasgow Love Theme which is why I purchased this CD. Yes, there are songs from the film that I do enjoy but, like I said, not enough of this haunting piece. Guess I will have to watch (and enjoy) this fun movie again to hear more of what I loved so much about the music.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked most of the book, the ending just didn't sit well with me.  I know a lot of people felt it was the perfect ending, but I just couldn't &#34;like&#34; it because it didn't seem realistic, or fit my belief in justice.  I understand some people's rationale that they deserved each other.  I just think that even if they did, how could it just end like that….it would have to escalate or end in an even worse way.
B000065K5S|4.0|Was gotten for friend who asked for it,she is very happy w/it,and for the price I paid was a very happy customer.<br />Sometimes can find some great bargains on Amazon.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|I bought this for my wife's new tower.  She's a happy camper and we didn't go broke.  Scores a 7.2 on the Windows 7 index.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I was looking forward to reading The Goldfinch after having read all the reviews. The writing is descriptive. You can visualize everything. But, it is just too wordy! Itis about 400 pages too long. The story is not that intriguing to merit being a 775 page book, I my opinion.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I have been reading David Baldacci's books for some time now<br />and must say this is another great read.  I also like his books because I don't have to worry about whether or not my family can listen to it and be embarrassed. I hated to see it end
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love it.... awesome game....  even got my fiance into it.... wish lives generated faster..... but patience is key.... Love it
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very thought out story. King answered a lot of my questions that I had from reading The Shining. Amazing that after all these years he could remember the little details from the original book and incorporate them into this book. Had me addicted from page one. Hated for it to end. I will never view the old people in RV's the same way again. One of the very few sequels that are almost as good if not better than the original.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is very addicting and more than just candy. Only drawback is if you are not able to go to next levels without friends sending tickets.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is an excellent storyteller with a vast knowledge of his subject. He is a master of suspense and a gifted character developer. I have read all of his books and enjoy his writing style.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|that sounds like the beet game ever and its free this is awesome I mean you get to pick your own stuff and its way better than playing it on someones phone
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Cool man like the graphics not really a game man but fun to play while my ole lady is watching her shows.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|If you have the original pirate adventure there will be no need to get this one. They are very similar.
0452295548|4.0|Very interesting and informative personal true story, written by a well known scientist specialized in the subject. It is, in some parts, a little repetitive, but it is easy to read and gives the reader a good idea of how both sides of the brain work and teaches us to exercise patience and never give up.
B006BXT4TI|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Black Keys, and this album is them at their best. Their sound continues to develop well remaining consistently raw and rough.
0596009208|5.0|I have had a love-hate relationship with this book for a while. I've tried to read this book and make sense of it many times over the years. The book being funny puts you at ease but I believe it makes you lazy at the same time, you will look for fun over learning as the books sets you up, and when the emphasis is shifted from learning, you don't learn. This was my perspective. Hey, everyone is different. But everyone you talk to and reviews you read about this book, have been praising this book. So, I said to myself, okay I will start a fresh but only this time I want to learn, fun is fun but let me put fun in the background and bring the learning part to the fore front... That's it I cracked the code, invented light blub, well not exactly, but now I see what everyone mean. This book is a gem. I have learnt and am learning so much from this book. It not only teaches how to code but also teaches inner workings of Java thus making it clear to understand how code to written one way or the other. And it is ALSO funny, witty and whimsical which I learned not to get carried away with. When you get it you get it, this book is a masterpiece.
B001I8A76A|5.0|I don't like it as well as Missundaztood, Try This, and Truth About Love, but it's still Pink, it's still awesome,  and worthy of 5 stars.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|The wind and rain hit New Mexico last night, so I decided to pull up to the couch and watch a movie. I hadn't seen this one, so it was the pick of the night.<br /><br />The other reviewers do a good job of summarizing the story, so I won't repeat that here.<br /><br />For the most part, the acting is very good in this movie, from Jolie and Depp to all the miscellaneous characters. There are twists and turns---and a few unexpected surprises---which means my attention was held throughout the film. It did, at times, become a bit unrealistic, almost bordering on silly, but that was ok.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you need to see a movie that doesn't require a lot of mental thought or analysis, this is a good choice. There isn't excessive violence, sex, or foul language, which means it would be suitable for an older teen. For anyone under 15, I doubt they would enjoy it.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|The VERY best Christmas concert ever  !!!  Just enough , of funny, traditional and Holy  !!! This one , is ALL class !! But , then again , it's Bocelli !!!! I am sooo tired of silly Christmas Specials , that have NOTHING to do with the true meaning of Christmas !!!  David Foster , knows how to get the best out of a tremendous talent !!  So, get yourself a cup of hot chocolate , light some candles , cuddle up with the whole family and get in the mood for this most precious and significant Christian holiday !!!!  Merry Christmas!!!!
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Since I was new to an ipad and teaching, mobilelite helped me bridge the learning gap. I am still learning about it.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Superb !!!!!!! What else is there to say about anything Adele records ???? I also have Adele 21 !!!! Just hoping that she'll come back with some more fantastic music for her millions of fans !! Thanks , Amazon for offering this cd at a great price !!!!
B00932AA5G|5.0|iit was a surprisingly interesting story with great characters. I didn't find the subtitles distracting at all. Very well acted.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Runs great, right out of the Box.  I have been looking for just the right package to access my PC at home, while I am away.  Didn't require a phd in technology to get up and running.  I am very happy to pay th $8.99 for the HD version, because it works so well.  Thanks Splashtop!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a fun time waster! It is a great game for killing time and working puzzles. I definitely would recommend.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This versipn of facebok is not current. I go under Chrome browser. A much better version is available that way. Easier to use under browser. Need to update to current version it was copyrighted in 2011. This version??.
006202406X|1.0|Totally agree with the previous poster MomoMonique. The book is boring plain and simple. I honestly feel as if the author totally changed direction between finishing the second book and starting this one. It was not what I expected at all and midway through I found myself not caring what happened to the characters. I feel the author was pressured to write another book and somewhat mailed it in. The best thing about this series is that it's over.
B00AKKGX4W|1.0|The fact that people were able to get through this book is surprising and commending because I've tried twice with no luck. Not my kind of reading.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|I am very disappointed in the quality of this box of DVDs!  The description was stated as &#34;Used/Very Good&#34;...The first disc was fine and I enjoyed the segments.  The second disc would NOT play!  I tried everything to rectify, but I was not able to view the next three programs...While this box was not particularly expensive, paying anything is a bit of an insult! I will not take time to return as I shouldn't have to do this.  I am very disappointed in Amazon...mg
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|See all my other reviews. It's an action figure for crying out loud! This dealer was very easy to work with.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun a little mundane but fun yes it was worth Down loading fun but not exciting if your looking for a fast based game or a challenging game this is not it but if you're looking for slow and easy something to do yup this is it
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|Just like the pc version no doubt about it It's fun but I want to play with friends too so how do u do multiplayer?
B003B02PFO|4.0|A clever and heart-warming change-of-pace novel from Grisham about a suburban family that decides to skip all the peripheral neighborhood rush of Christmas by going on vacation to the islands at Christmas time. Read it and find out how the family's plans are thwarted, and they turn out to exhibit the truest spirit of Christmas on their block.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The book starts out interesting but quickly becomes boring though it does pick up the pace at the end.  Perhaps it's because JG spent too much time reminiscing about A Time To Kill by reintroducing some of the characters from that book and recapping many of its events.  I loved A Time To Kill but I felt Sycamore Row needed to stand on its own.
B005BOX7BE|5.0|This is absolutely amazing. The characters are interesting, the plot is intense with unexpected twists, and the dialog is fun and engaging. This is one of the most sophisticated and well-done shows I've seen.
006202406X|1.0|So so very disappointed. Never anticipated a book as much as this one. Found the whole genetic thing diminished the factions and especially the divergent concept.<br />I found myself being frustrated with the time that Ms Roth spent on the GD uprising.<br />When I heard, then skipped forward to read, that tris died I felt so betrayed and cheated. This trilogy was many things, but above all the incredible, real love story was its core. To kill Tris (so unceremoniously I might add) is unforgivable. Will not finish it and it has ruined the whole trilogy for me.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|the back of the case is full of scratches, it looks like a used/returned item. even if it is not, it shows just how bad the quality of the case is.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|don't like the fact that to advance levels you have to ask other people or pay to move on. other than that the levels are very challenging and can keep you entertained for a long time
B00FHEP9XM|1.0|I'd installed this app, thinking that after buying it I could uninstall this useless app store, just keeping Swype updated by Google playstore. But if I uninstall Amazon, Swype just keeps asking me to reinstall it every time I try to change settings. Then I'd tried to uninstall it and get my money back, as it is possible on Google play until 15min after purchase, but Amazon didn't allow me! Now I'm feeling stupid to buy an app here and not on Google play. Thank you!
B002LAM7PI|1.0|Could not even watch the movie!!!!  I tried to upload the movie for my daughter to have her watch it when we watched some other movie on TV.  It just stalled on one spot and would not budge.  She and I were very disappointed.  I would not recommend the service on the Kindle Fire.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington was excellent. You were torn between his ability to save lives and his inability to control his addiction.  Thoroughly entertaining.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I enjoyed this book  It was different from his others  But had a different message to gain from it<br /><br />Take.each day and enjoy it. It's called  life
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game fun and challenging cant stop playing over and over again nice mix of crosswords. and suduko
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|Trent Reznor has always been an interesting force in music. This new album makes him even more interesting as he yet explores new territory. Gu never bores me
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This is exactly what James Altucher has done. He coined the Choose Yourself Era. There no better to phrase what the world and it's citizens are experiencing.  This a master piece of work.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|Actually its 3 1/2. Her first two albums were a lot more musical and showed off her versatility vocally and lyrically than this effort. Seems like she is trying to hard to be like everyone else Jumping on the dub step electronica bandwagon and therefor seems highly derivative. She does it very well but so what?
B000JIHP88|5.0|This has been a GREAT mobile! I bought it over 4 years ago for my first and I used it for my second baby, let a friend borrow it for her baby and am now using it for my 3rd! The babies never seem to notice the light up picture but love the music and mobile part! My baby falls asleep to it all the time!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Love/hate. Love how fun it is, but hate how hard some of the levels are. I also wish there was an easier way to unlock new levels rather than getting friends to help or purchasing tickets to unlock it.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Different, I like this type game. It is one that can pass many hours and keep your mind active. Try it you will like it also.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game, lot's of guns to choose from, and multiple different animal you can hunt, and great graphics. But the energy goes away quickly. Overall 5 star game .LOVE IT!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a very long time.  It's a page turner and the story lines are so well put together.  I highly recommend it to everyone!  I'm hoping there will be a movie of this book!  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0385474547|5.0|GREAT BUY!! This was absolutely My lucky day!! This Book was in EXCELLENT condition and it was an AWESOME price!!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Who doesn't like Harry POTTER.  I HAPPEN TO HAVE ALL HIS DVDS PLUS ALL HIS STORY BOOKS. couldn't miss any of them.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|...against the fun of this game.  If you are a fan of the movie or just Thor in general you will love this rpg. Challenging and exciting is the way this game is laid out.  Hours of fun!  Addictive.  Now you should definitely get this game.  I've got to get back to playing and defending the nine realms.  For Asgard!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Great new songs by Paul McCartney. I have all his albums. He is the best Beatle of them all, May he live a long long time.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Profound. So many deep profound thoughts and ideas.  Hope promoting - human spirit rising above adversity and even horrific circumstances.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good thing I am retired...if I had a real job I would probably get fired..  never get bored PLAYING .
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is the fourth time I've read this series in anticipation for the fifth book. Hurry up...Love the series on HBO too.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|Love this movie and it's going to be something to watch with my nephew every Halloween. Recommended for a good Disney movie.
1423101502|5.0|My 9 year tells me how much he loves this series! Great way to get a 4th grader interested in reading. The myths are a great introduction to Greek mythology. Have opened lots of questions, which peeked further research. Love it!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Pretty neat game.  Not one of those limited to rare resources.  Really enjoy it and is a must play.  Facebook friendly.
1423101499|5.0|My 9 year old loves this series! He hates reading but when he finds a book worth his time, he keeps at it. And that's what I like to see -- reading endurance.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|This was a very entertaining show.  I wasn't sure what to expect going into it, but what I found was a smart, sexy and very thrilling story with a lot of great actors.  Unfortunately this is the only season they currently have available on Amazon Instant Video (at least for free), but I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's on the fence.  I ended up watching almost the entire season over the span of 3 days.  It was very addicting!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and Fun...also addictive! Can't wait for more levels to become available! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge!
B009HEMJCW|5.0|How often does the princess have the power to not only break her own curse, but chose her own path!!! I loved it, it was a great movie :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I go as far as I can and then get a little help from the answers app. atleast there is somewhere to go for help and you don't have to buy coins to keep playing
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was very unexpected. I had no idea what I was in for which was a breath of fresh air. I had read a previous review of this book in a blog and the reviewer had said that this was a book that stays with you forever and I have to agree. This story I won't ever forget because of the mastery of the author in convincing me the reader that there was no other way but the one chosen at the end. I loved and hated this book because it made me realize that had I been in the same position I would have chosen that same end something that until before I read this book I considered cowardly but being in that situation I see that it actually took a lot of courage. It was difficult to read from the different points of view in the book because there are some characters that I didn't like but after getting a little back story I was able to understand where they were coming from and how much they were actually hurting. This is by no means an easy book to read but the rollercoaster ride is worth it because it is such a magnificently crafted story that you'll want to read it all over again once it is over. Some things shouldn't define you but some unfortunately due until you are nothing more than that, it is how you deal and how you overcome those obstacles that show you who you are and the strength you didn't know you had.
B00C8RFRNI|5.0|The film shows the lengthy and tedious background work done by devoted, patriotic women  which led to the final elimination of bin Laden.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|New CD  Korn has done a great job with getting out the new. This was much better than I expected, I really love the content. Great Job.
0385349831|5.0|Like all of Coelho's books, this is beautiful and uplifting. I love the mystical quality in this book in particular.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|I purchased the triple pack because I thought this movie would be similar to another movie that appeared on video the beginning of the year.  N. Koreans taking over the White House-that was a better picture.  This movie was horrible and I loved most of the actors.  It was unrealistic and way too long. What a waste of $26.00.  However, the triple pack came with another movie.  Much better.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I was enjoying the game until I could not advance without paying or having a friend.otherwise it is a fun and challanginggame.
B00CDUVDEC|3.0|Not my favorite work by Anselmo for sure but its ok. Unless you need everything by him get it on sale or used.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|Book written in a totally different angle with deep insights , must read,for aspiring leaders, people seeking inspiration and technocrats
B000063DFQ|5.0|Oh man, this is not their best album, but it is absolutely essential for any Maiden fan (or metal fan for that matter). Die With Your Boots On, The Trooper, and Still Life will stand up next to any of Maiden's best songs. If you love Number of the Beast or Powerslave, you must get this album.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|I Love this diary! I write/type in it almost every day.  It has a password feature for extra security.  Highly recommend it to anyone needing a digital diary.
B0057GYOA4|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I think that the music on this album is incredible but they didn't do a good job of remastering the album. It's frustrating because this album really influenced my musical tastes and brings back great memories of middle and high school. Please get the original 1991 album release and just turn up the volume a bit. I gave this 4 stars because of the music, not for the actual sound, and because the extra tracks are pretty awesome.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Great suspense and the anticipation of some good action times. You just have a long build up to the eventual action bits.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This really is a tribute to John Grosham  and those that love to read him.<br />A death by suicide and the legalities of the Mississippi laws - are spelled out.  seth Hubbard who committed his own deathleft approximately$124 million dollars to his (black) housekeeper.<br />The case eventually goes to trial - with a white man named Jake Brigance whose only aim is to see that Seth's will is carried out. Later in the story you can understand what SycamoreRow means and the importance of it as it relates to the will and the black people.<br />A wonderful story..
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I have been enjoying this game all day! It really keeps your interest with the different challenges they have you do in each level!!! Great for the brain!!
B006CJNOD8|5.0|Alan Judd writes well, building and describing his characters whilst working the story around the events of the time. I am looking forward to Mr Judd's next book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book all around but i recommend reading the first two books first or you might not understand it.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|needs a stronger, more interesting villain. All the Iron Man and certainly Chris Nolan's Batman series had that going on.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it was great.It was a good way to praise the lord today.<br />good very good to read and do some stuff.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally Candy Crush on the kindle! The worldwide addiction continues!  Really like the bright color on the kindle - thank you!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel Washington was great--as always. Was glad to see the character do the right thing in the end.  Good story but one that made you wonder;  could this actually happen!?
0399159347|5.0|Started a little slow, but once it got rolling, WOW.  I loved how the writer finished up at the end by tying all loose ends together.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the story. It was inspiring to me to see what good written words can do for a human soul. Any story involving Hitler is painful to read about. It is always reassuring to see how humans can overcome even the worst experiences.
B003V40SGS|4.0|Cheesy movie from my childhood, and I love it. It was fun to watch this movie after all these years. I appreciated the fact there was no foul language, nudity, or gratuitous violence. It is a decent story, and fairly good (but not necessarily scientifically accurate) science fiction. The special effects are good for it's day, and I really appreciate it is not completely CGI just for the sake of CGI. True, it is not quite the original Star Wars or Star Trek II, but it is no Waterworld either.<br /><br />These old movies are enjoyable to watch because of the imagination and skill it took to produce everything from the robots, to the musical score. Modern movies are often about a certain movie star or certain music group instead of a well told story. I always thought this should have been a series of movies, or a TV show.
B007XUMHQK|5.0|A mature Quicksilver Messenger Service and Nicky Hopkins........excellent album.......great sound of the times.......important album from a special time for making music
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I can only get so far and then it locks me out for 1/2 hour or I get so far and I can't go any further without paying.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|LIKE 👍 or should I say YIKE !  A not so fiction science fiction of our present day always on-line reality!
B006AX6ONI|4.0|What I liked about this book is that it gave you insight into Mark's early start in his career.  It also provides points to focus on in any business to become successful.  Mark Cuban is a very driven man which has resulted in his success.  A must read for those interested in becoming an entrepreneur or successful businessman.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Clean, elegant, and efficient. An intuitive mind was at work here. I'll be looking for more innovation from Ks Mobile.
B000063TDY|5.0|The price of this product this one good bad the sending cost for is Brazil that was expensive.<br />You have to lower this value.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun. I've had no problems with the app. Some of the other reviewers mentioned trouble solving some rooms and the app needing directions...I felt the game was self explanatory, and the levels are easy but not too easy. I'm on level 11 they have progressively gotten harder but not unsolvable. I would have given the game 5 stars but I feel the graphics could be better...and they might well be in the paid version. As far a playability the game is a 5 star, you won't find a better app for the price of FREE!!
B008GFI4KY|5.0|The price of this product this one good bad the sending cost for is Brazil that was expensive.<br />You have to lower this value.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game is challenging and entertaining and very easy<br />for beginners.Everyone should get this app.It's cool&times;epic<br />people!Who ever does not get it is a noon.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Occasionally a little frustrating,but overall a good brain exercise. Really enjoyed  this a lot. Hope new levels become available very soon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You should get  this because it is a cool game and you can pick your<br /><br />  own minion. You  should get it!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|IT FUN BUT STILL HAS GLITCHES. DIFFICULTIES WITH SIGNING INTO FB. COINS &amp; CROWNS GO FAST. ONCE IT GETS FIXED I'LL COME BACK TO FIX THE RATING I GAVE JUST NOW.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I super love this game, I have three horses right now, and I hope to get more. Love, love, love it.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a great game to play and explore. The graphics are good and the play is very responsive. Only wish it would take less time to level up and thereby open new quests and areas.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm super sad... that the series is over and the way it is over. But it was a fantastic series that kept me entertained for the past 4 days.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's great to see such a variety of videos on YouTube.  I like streaming our family videos and photos from the cloud.  Have used a wired HDMI connection from the computer to the TV but wireless is better.  Simple set-up.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Just like on Facebook love this game. Something kids can play too. Hope you will enjoy it too<br />Have some fun
B008MA83HC|5.0|Great songs and very varied, definitely the best of the band. For 32 songs, the price was a unbeatable plus you also get a free download.
B004WR125O|2.0|Mine failed after nine months use. Replacing with faster TP-Link product. Very disappointed with Onkyo problems. HDMI issues abound. Buyer beware.
B00139B39E|5.0|We are new to this band, but after reading other reveiws stating it was similar to some of our other favorites, bought it and could'nt be happier. Recommend. great price and quick shipping
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I like it a lot. It's easy, quick, and fun. If they had more languages like Irish or Russian that'd be cool too. I learned German and Italian pretty quickly. Imma be in Italy hitting up all the cute Italian boys brb.
B004DTLK8A|5.0|I added this to my Statovarious collection, and was very pleased with it. Great price and always quick shipping. always
B003K9LZSO|5.0|The episode Midnight is so good. It's like a classic Twilight Zone episode. Nothing fancy, just a frightening situation and a real discussion for 40 minutes. I absolutely loved it. And of course the rest of season four is great as well. David Tennant brings out the best (and worst) of The Doctor.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I bought this when it came out, and as a avid santans follower since the 60's really enjoyed this cd. Had to buy this replacement after my first was accidently brokeen. quick delivery and great price. cant beat amazon.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Anthony Ryan is brilliant. He will now be added to my must read list where only a small group of Authors reside.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This story is about training young people to battle the alien race that attacked man years ago. The goal is to insure the catastrophic losses during the battle do not occur again. Yet there is so much more to the story, it is much deeper.<br /><br />What is life like for the extremely intelligent child? Especially when adults manipulate a young person's intelligence and raise them in an environment to fit their own goals and desires? What becomes of the child as they age in a very focused training environment? What happens when this manipulation is extreme and the child comes into their own and sees it for what it really is? What is the aftermath?<br /><br />This is one of those books that will stay with you for many reasons.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this game! It's a building and creating game with music. Only down sides are Dragon costs too much and the game keeps over heating my Kindle HD.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great product. When wifi source is far, delaies in cast shows.<br />Offsinc appears when casting in 1080p and sometimes at 720.
B00CZ1TMUQ|4.0|The two young singers are dynamic and express themselves like they have sung for ages, but yet they re still teenagers.
1840226625|5.0|Fitzgerald is the most marvelous, silken writer. The reader is tenderly ensnared by the prose. Of his time, but above it.
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|I think this is the best episode yet. The writing harks to something the Governor said a while back, when one of his assistants asked him (paraphrasing): &#34;What would your daughter think if she could see you now?&#34;  The Governor had replied, &#34;She'd be afraid of me. But she'd be alive now.&#34;  I was aware of that quote throughout &#34;Live Bait,&#34; and it made me cry to see &#34;Brian&#34; get to relive that moment and save his (new) daughter this time.  It breathed meaning into an otherwise bleakest of all possible worlds.  And there's nothing more delicious and rare than a three-dimensional villain! That's what made the Soprano's so exceptional and so popular. This episode actually made me weep.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Eight films for seven volumes. The whole saga in these films. A real treat.<br /><br />The second beautiful things is that the same actors are used for the main children characters through the eight films, hence over the long period of time it took to produce them. We see the kids becoming teens and twinks under our own eyes and that is also realistically satisfying. They might have been slightly too old at the beginning but they are truly their age at the end.<br /><br />Then the films being a lot more concentrated than the books, some elements come out a lot stronger, to a very critical point. The fact that Harry Potter is an orphan is very strongly emphasized by the films and his uncle foster-father along with his cousin foster-brother are ridiculous, made ridiculous, overdone in the ridiculous line, probably slightly too much in the line of too much. They should be pathetic and appear cruelly sadistic and they only look clownish and farcical.<br /><br />The films also concentrate slightly too much on the fact that Harry Potter is a young teenager and then a young man who is attached to men of all sorts. The story as it is revealed in the end clearly identifies his fate to the decisions of a few men and to the fate of these few men. The only woman that has counted in his life was his own mother who saved him from annihilation with her own love and nothing else. This vision of Harry Potter being a man of many men is very sexist in a way and this world of wizardry is very sexist in all kinds of ways and it is not the Weasley sister and Hermione who save the story from being a man’s story for men and only men. Girls and women just have to look, watch, admire and applaud but they have no real role to play, or hardly some ancillary roles here and there, like cleaning the teacups. The books were slightly less sexist and we could have expected the films to change that kind of bias.<br /><br />Harry Potter is entirely dependent on Dumbledore who never tells him the truth and that his fate has been decided by three men: Voldemort who wants to kill him to be unique and sole master in the world, Dumbledore and Snape who want to bring Harry Potter to his resurrection in order for him to destroy Voldemort, because Harry Potter can only do that if Voldemort tries to kill him and succeeds, though he will only kill in Harry Potter the part of himself, Voldemort, he had invested in the kid when he tried to kill him the first time when a baby. This Voldemort share in Harry Potter is represented by the scar on his forehead. Snape and Dumbledore knew that but they never told Harry Potter who finally knows when he is able to recuperate the tears of Snape before he dies when killed by Voldemort and these tears reveal this secret  when dropped I n the special secret reader in Dumbledore’s office.<br /><br />That makes three men, and two will have to die for Harry Potter’s Voldemort part to be killed by Voldemort and for Harry Potter then to be able to kill the third man of this triad.<br /><br />Three more men are necessary for Harry Potter to survive through it all. These three more men save him in the nick of time three times. In the “Goblet of Fire” he is saved by the sacrifice of another student who is killed by Voldemort and it is this death that enables Harry Potter to escape the same fate thanks to the intervention of the sword of his school house. He is saved by Ron Weasly when he is trying to recuperate the sword of his school house in an ice-locked river. He is saved in his last fight against Voldemort when another boy is able to recuperate that sword in the ruins of the school and to cut off the head of Voldemort’s snake, which makes Voldemort decompose and fall down into a pile of ashes.<br /><br />When you add to these two triple sets the giant Hagrid in the back of all these men you have it nearly all since you should also see the short-lived and evanescent role of Harry Potter’s godfather Black who will be important all along, or nearly, since his elf will be crucial in the seventh and last episode when Harry Potters is trying to bring together the three Deadly Hallows that will bring Voldemort down.<br /><br />Only two maybe three women are important: Mrs Weasley, Ron’s mother, in her great motherly quality essentially knitting pullovers for the boys. Then Hermione who is a mixed blood and will be divided between Ron and Harry all along, though she will marry Ron in the end. And Ron’s sister who will eventually marry Harry in the end. Both marriages produce children, with a third one in the back: the son of the Slitheryn opponent to Harry Potter who nearly ended up as a direct servant of Voldemort, and Harry produces a boy with a triple name, two given names and Potter, the two given names representing the main men who supported Harry in his adventures.<br /><br />On the other hand there are many nasty men of  course to balance the important good men, but there are a lot more nasty women that make the image of women in this film very negative. At the same time they can never be at the top and have the upper hand. No matter how nasty these women may be they can only be second fiddlers to Voldemort of course, second fiddlers he can dispose of at absolutely any time.<br /><br />These films make the ternary pattern even stronger than we could expect as if we were reliving the chase for the Holy Grail and its Christian Trinity. The final fight is between Harry, Voldemort and Voldemort’s snake, though the snake is fighting against Ron and Hermione and it is when the third student arrives with the sword and kills the snake that Harry Potter can succeed. Such ternary patterns are numerous.<br /><br />Harry’s mother is married to Harry’s father but Snape is in love with Harry’s mother and Harry has the same protection against Dementors as Snape, a doe. Harry is the son of his father and his mother but he carries some part of Voldemort in him and hence has three parents. Voldemort will have to kill his own contribution in Harry to become killable by Harry, provided he has some help from a triad of students behind, but Voldemort can only have the opportunity to do so if Dumbledore and Snape are killed, if possible Dumbledore by Snape and then Snape by Voldemort.<br /><br />Finally in the end Harry Potter has – with some help from three friends – killed Voldemort and he has recuperated the famous wand that was in Dumbledore’s possession and then had been stolen by Voldemort from Dumbledore’s own grave. Harry Potter, as the third owner, destroys it. It will not have a fourth owner and Harry Potter has three reasons to do it: He cannot possess it (and you possess a wand only if that wand chooses to be possessed by you) because only someone who has killed the person he loves can possess this wand. Dumbledore had killed his own sister? Voldemort had killed so many people he should have loved but he never loved anyone anyway, and thus he can’t possess it as he says himself to Snape who is the proper owner because he killed Dumbledore who he loved. Harry Potter had not killed one single person he loved. The second reason is that this wand being destroyed is a promise of peace, thus the end of these adventures. The third reason is that Harry Potter refuses power and that is the decision of the author, Ms Rowling who has decided to bury Harry Potter in some kind of ossified and frozen ice conservatory out of which she will never take him.<br /><br />A shameful decision for an author. Of course the films are clearly showing there is a next generation with Harry Potter’s own son, but that is a promise Ms Rowling does not seem to be willing to follow so far. The films are promising it but the book did not and the author is trying to entertain and distract herself in some social oriented novels and crime stories that are far from being in any way able to compete with the great masters of these genres.<br /><br />The films are a great sagabut it is to be regretted the saga has been stopped by its author who is trying to play writer in, fields she does not really control.<br /><br />A last remark on Daniel Radcliffe. He is a great child-actor and we can see him growing but he is developed as a very stiff character, static in expression and action. That is a handicap in this profession. He could have learned how to be active and how to build a real rich and passionate character he would impersonate in its deepest feelings and emotions since he is far from being a child in the last films and his character is old enough not to be a child any more and become a passion ate teenager. He can’t satisfy himself with being that stiff and cold an actor forever. Methinks he could have been directed better in the last three or four films.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUemort will have to kill his own contribution in Harry to become killable by Harry, provided he has some help from a triad of students behind, but Voldemort can only have the opportunity to do so if Dumbledore and Snape are killed, if possible Dumbledore by Snape and then Snape by Voldemort.<br /><br />Finally in the end Harry Potter has – with some help from three friends – killed Voldemort and he has recuperated the famous wand that was in Dumbledore’s possession and then had been stolen by Voldemort from Dumbledore’s own grave.

B00DHHWXYY|4.0|THE GREAT GATSBY – 1974<br /><br />To really understand this film, or the novel behind, you have to keep in mind the alternative story that D.H. Lawrence tells us in Women in Love. In the same way we are dealing with love in the upper class of the very rich  before the First World War and then after before the big crisis of 1929. I will not compare the two here but the two films also came out in the same period, the early 1970s after the 1968 political and generational crisis. They both carry the denunciation of the upper class.<br /><br />We are telling the story from an outside point of view but yet close to the protagonists. The story teller, Mr. Nick Carraway, is a neighbor of Mr. Jay Gatsby and a bond seller in Wall Street, New York. Nothing to do with present time golden boys, the traders in Brokerage firms. Well-off but definitely not rich and anyway with no rich parents. Yet he is the cousin of another woman who is from an extremely rich family, married to an extremely rich man. Gatsby is the black sheep in the neighborhood.<br /><br />He is from an extremely poor family. He managed to get an Oxford education after 1918 because he became an officer and was heavily decorated during the war and he then took advantage of veterans’ privileges. He had also the chance to fall in the hands of a certain Meyer Wolfsheim who introduced him to business, though we are never told what that business really is. We can imagine, due to the speed with which he became rich (less than eight years) that it had to be in some financial speculation in the 1920s. That period is clearly identified with the paraphernalia of the time and with the music, including the dancing, including the famous song Charleston. Note that Jay might not be a real first name, but an initial and that the name Gatsby is not the real name of the man who was the son of  a certain Mr. Gatz we see at the end. Note too that the name Wolfsheim is of course meaningful and the main principle of this man is “we can be a friend of a man when he is alive, but not when he is dead.”<br /><br />At the end of WWI, Jay Gatsby, alias Major Gatz, fell in love with Daisy, a rich girl. But he was a poor man. She fell in love with him on a short-lived whim and he fell in love with her forever. But a rich girl does not marry a poor boy, as she says so well. So he disappears to build a fortune and she got married to a rich boy and became Mrs. Daisy Buchanan.  She had promised to wait but rich girls never wait.<br /><br />When he is finally rich he manages to get close to her and then to be introduced to her by her cousin, Nick Carraway, and before he had tried to attract her attention by having enormous garden parties every week end in that summer of 1926 or 1927. She eventually falls in the trap.<br /><br />The rest is to be discovered in the film, or the book.<br /><br />The morality, bad word, the immorality of this film is that in spite of the American Dream, rich people attract and mix with rich people and poor people can only eventually be accepted when they are rich. The second lesson is that rich people with a rich pedigree can always manage to get through any crime or accident or whatever particularly by pointing at another of their class but that does not have the rich pedigree they have. This immorality can even be worse: rich men can have as many poor mistresses they will furnish with some luxury as much, and as many, as they want or can afford. But a rich woman is not supposed to have any affair with a rich man of any sort, and she will not condescend to have an affair with a poor man. It would not be in anyway anything but a short and exciting sexual episode that would be doomed even before it starts, and like the praying mantis she would destroy the poor lover after using it.<br /><br />In other words a woman is the property of her husband but in no way the husband is the property of his wife, and social inequality is absolute in the USA, just like in Great Britain,in the 1920s just the way Henry James described it in his novels more than thirty years before. Nothing has changed.<br /><br />The narrator is able to express this immorality and that is the only moral element in this film, and novel. Morality is on the side here of the upper middle class, and a lower stratum in that upper middle class. That means there may be some hope for such a society that is doomed because the rich do not care for their neighbors in all the meanings of this word. They only care for their money and the gossips that can be aired around them about them.<br /><br />This older film shows these elements with great care but at the same time it is obvious Jay Gatsby is not natural as a rich man. He is not able to play the game properly: he is awkward, he is shy, he is inconsiderate in his presents and in his lavish help he may give to someone who is trying to make him realize one of his intentions or desires. One hundred white roses are not even enough in such a situation and he very well may send one thousand. The dialogue is good too in the fact that Jay Gatsby is the only one who has a linguistic idiosyncratic tick and he calls every man “old sport” and such an Oxfordian tic shows in him a rather recent integration in the class of the super rich: he cuts a role, a character, a behavior and sticks to it: he believes in a way the tuxedo makes the money aristocrat. And he is wrong: the money aristocrat is in the careless and nonchalant way he wears the tuxedo and that cannot be imitated.<br /><br />All together a beautiful but cruel film on the egocentric selfishness of the super rich born super rich.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUin the 1920s just the way Henry James described it in his novels more than thirty years before.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I waffled between giving this book three or four stars. If I hadn't loved the first two so much, I probably would have gone with four, but this just fell a bit short of expectations for me. Maybe there was too much hype going in, but it honestly felt like a completely different style of writing to me. Perhaps that was compounded by the shifting POV of narration. This final installment felt a little unpolished and less mature than the first two. I also felt like it couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be or what it wanted its message to be until the very end, which made it difficult to engage as a reader. There were certainly good parts and I'm glad to know what happened with the characters, but it wasn't up to par with the earlier books.

B0055D3EOG|5.0|Insidious means to proceed in a gradual, subtle way but with very harmful effects. It is very tricky to make a horror film because part of being a man is to never admit you are scared and all that false bravado. This is why men giggle at the movies. Anyway..<br /><br />Insidious is a compelling horror with a most unique storyline. Why? Not only is the plot projection stunning but there is an overwhelming voice of reason in the protagonist. You can tell a good horror film from a bad horror film when the film is three steps ahead of your voice of reason. On that level, it certainly engages, charms, surprises you with the ideas it conjures and more. But it’s not just a horror film, it is so tastefully done that I doubt I have seen anything in my life that has stunned me as much. The Conjuring comes to mind but this is to Conjuring what “Pulp Fiction” is to Death Proof or what “Departed” is to “Goodfellas” - James Wan, I predict will rewrite how horror is done. They take all the anguish of a horrible dream, spill it here and there and leave you gutted. This has two most beautifully shot horror scenes.<br /><br />That said, I can say without any doubt this is the newest entrant to my all time top 100 list. I don’t know quite where but it most definitely is.<br /><br />PS - I just finished watching this. I didn't know what hit me or if I was in a coma. I couldn't move, the hair on my body were dutifully singing their own national anthem. That's it, Im done.

To say it is a titan of the insurance industry is something of an understatement, although, contrary to what some believe, it is not an insurance company as such. Exactly what it is and what it isn't and what it does and how and why it does it - are all clearly and precisely explained in author Julian Burling's monumental and highly readable `Lloyd's Law and Practice' published recently by Informa Law at Routledge -- the latest title in their Insurance Law Library series.<br /><br />Without doubt this is a book which will come to be regarded as an indispensable reference for anyone, including practitioners whose business is with Lloyd's, from underwriters, brokers and regulators to clients and auditors.<br /><br />Writing the book, says Burling, `has been like painting the Forth Bridge,' especially following the seismic changes in the UK insurance industry's regulatory framework reflected primarily in the Financial Services Act 2012.<br /><br />Fortunately Burling - a barrister at Lincoln's Inn -- brings all his authority and experience gained at Lloyd's and in the Lloyd's market to this formidable task. As Sir John Thomas (now the Lord Chief Justice) remarks in the Foreword, the author describes the structure and environment of Lloyds, as well as its history `with the expertise that can come only from someone who has been present at the creation of the modern Lloyd's who has left his mark on the legal aspects; and who understands and can explain every nuance.'<br /><br />Certainly the very nature of Lloyd's is nuanced.  `Lloyd's, as the author points out, `is an insurance market in Lime Street' with a history dating back to the seventeenth century when its activities were based, not at permanent premises, but at Mr Edward Lloyd's coffee house in Tower Street, which moved to Lombard Street in 1691.  Business carried on in a coffee house?  How very modern.<br /><br />More than a market however, \\"Lloyd's\\" is a statutory corporation, incorporated by a private Act of Parliament in 1871. Primarily it involves the carrying of insurance business by its members on their own account. If all this sounds complicated, it is and a lot more so; yet all is deftly explained in detail throughout this very readable text.  Also note the chapter on taxation of members of Lloyd's by David Clissitt, a partner at Deloitte.<br /><br />Speaking of detail, the book contains a wealth of that as just one look at the detailed table of contents will indicate. To cite only a few examples, there are chapters on delegated underwriting... the claims process at Lloyd's... financial resources... accounts and reporting... enforcement... dispute resolution and of course a great deal more.  Researchers will appreciate the extensive tables of cases, tables of statutes and other instruments, tables of statutory instruments and European legislation, as well as Lloyd's Byelaws.  Also, there are six appendices and a detailed index.<br /><br />Anyone needing to understand the nuanced complexities of Lloyd's (and that would include most people in the City) will garner an impressive amount of knowledge and expertise on the subject simply by acquiring this book, which, in our view, is destined to become the definitive work on Lloyd's.  The law of England, as the author believes it to be, is stated as at 1 March 2013.treet, which moved to Lombard Street in 1691.  Business carried on in a coffee house?

Certain steps have been taken to address this issue, some not very positive, but in the meantime, the restrictions on access to banking are persistent and widespread.<br /><br />Even worse is the position of the poor in the third world, as Ranajoy Basu, the consulting editor of this important new book points out.  However, a solution, or at least a partial one, has evolved in the last twenty years or so, hence the gradual proliferation worldwide of microfinance -- a term which can refer to a number of different `micro' financial solutions.<br /><br /> Microfinance began apparently as `a simple idea to provide business loans to the poor.'  It now includes savings and insurance institutions and other services such as mobile banking.  The editor quotes the McKinsey estimate that there are roughly 2.5 billion people without access to banking worldwide.  Thus the demand for financial services to the poor will inevitably continue to grow.<br /><br />Recently published by Globe Law and Business, this book examines the issues and problems linked to microfinance from a number of key perspectives, bringing together the expertise of no less than 17 experts, mostly from legal, business or academic backgrounds.  All are microfinance practitioners, including regulators, economists, investors and lawyers (from such firms as Allen & Overy and Clifford Chance, for example).  As the editor rather poetically puts it, the book helps you `hear the voices of the various participants in the microfinance industry and see the sector through their eyes.'<br /><br />Grouped logically under five headings, the various chapters cover a  satisfyingly wide range of topics, from hurdles and key issues -- and governance and sustainability -- to Sharia-compliant microfinance... microfinance and the empowerment of women... and microfinance without borders.  Here we cite only a few examples of the variety of subject matter covered in this book, which also focuses on regulatory issues.<br /><br />As microfinance evolves into an exciting new sector of endeavour, the recent publication of this book will be equally exciting and more importantly, enlightening for a wide range of legal practitioners, especially those involved in the financial sector who work internationally. Basu, a structured finance and capital markets lawyer at Reed Smith, has put together a varied and insightful compendium of expertise on microfinance, which provides an information-rich resource to practitioners, or indeed anyone professionally involved in this continually evolving and diverse area of financial services..'<br /><br />Grouped logically under five headings, the various chapters cover a  satisfyingly wide range of topics, from hurdles and key issues -- and governance and sustainability -- to Sharia-compliant microfinance... microfinance and the empowerment of women... and microfinance without borders.

B0091R6RYG|5.0|excellent crayons--a great splurge!  They smell better, blend better, and last so much longer than traditional (cheaper) crayons. Don't let the smaller color variety deter you, the colors come out so beautifully it's well worth it.  Update, I've owned these for over 3 years.  Both me and my toddler love them
0385351399|5.0|This is an extremely creepy book regarding the increasing lack of privacy on the internet.  It is capitalist version of &#34;1984&#34; where all your tastes, habits and inclinations are being monitored on the Net - which is already happening!  Do you ever notice when you do online shopping for a particular item, you get flooded with blinking ads for related items?  Facebook is another example; how you get deluged by people you've only had the most remote contact with - and everything you put there is accessible by anyone and everyone.  We're already looking at emails being monitored by government security agencies scanning for certain incriminating words.<br /><br />It begins in an unassuming way, Mae is hired by a major Net Company called &#34;The Circle&#34; comparable to Google which a search tool that lumps all your tastes and search history into a single profile so you don't have to keep registering on all kinds of web pages, thinking of different passwords.  She feels she is in heaven in a company which is very supportive of employers and all their various needs.  But the catch is that Mae finds she is required to participate in company activities 24/7, and her participation is rated for promotion.  She is also required to constantly rate products.  Finally, all employees are required to wear cameras and monitoring devices to record all their activities 24/7.  And the Circle creates a world where everyone knows what everyone else is doing, so there is absolutely no privacy.  There are cameras and monitors everywhere, and all internet activity is scanned.  The logic behind this is if everyone knows they are constantly being watched, no one would be inclined to do anything devious or illegal.  They set it up so government officials are all required to be &#34;transparent&#34; in this way.  Like the situation in &#34;1984&#34;, there is no way to deviate or rebel in this kind of world.  Since everyone is watching everyone else, people are on their best behavior to go with the trends, not daring to speak up and propose alternatives.<br /><br />The creepy thing is this is exactly where we are going, a world and economy dictated exclusively by the Net to set the stage for a technological totalitarian corporatocracy.  Like &#34;1984&#34;, this is a warning.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very disappointed in the last book of the trilogy!  The first two books I couldn't put down.  There seemed to be a lack of direction.  Certainly not of the same caliber of the first two!
0385537131|5.0|Grisham writes like no other….from the first words one is hooked and it doesn't stop till you close the<br />cover.  I literally read till I couldn't anymore….slept …..then started again.<br /><br />Read this book.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Very well written with excellent character development.  A refreshing change from so many of the new novels available.  Also reveals deplorable situation with religious orphanages that apparently existed right up until the 1990s.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|Jeff Beck always been one of my guitar heroes, he is just unique in what he plays, if you love rock music, definitely Jeff is your thing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Convenient App<br />With my new Kindle Fire Hd I was advised in a few of the manuals I perused to try a battery app. This one suits .me well. I like knowing what percent of battery life is left, and HOW much time that means for various uses; internet, reading, video, audio...
B000059T00|5.0|This is a classic I still have in vinyl, I was curious to hear how it will sound in digital format ... I was not disappointed!
B00EO10M54|5.0|Before buying a Movie, Music or game CD/DVD, Look it up on Wikipedia.org.<br />In most cases it will have a listing of release versions.<br />This may include:<br />Explicit vs. non-explicit lyrics<br />Deluxe Editions,<br />International Editions,<br />Editions specific to a store, such as Best Buy, Target, Walmart, or Amazon.com<br />Editions that include a second CD/DVD with music videos, outtakes, bloopers, etc.<br />Coupons good for online gaming credit, free levels or other game features, or gaming guides.<br />The artist or publisher may also make unique features or limited edition artwork available only via their house website,<br />which may cost slightly more, but you get something people will not get anywhere else.<br /><br />This way you can choose the version you want without finding out later that you could have gotten more for your money.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.
B003UESJHE|5.0|There is a reason this movie got an academy award.  The acting was superior and it made me wonder what happened to the people after the movie ended.  King George VI the man who became king when his brother abdicated to marry Mrs. Simpson. is the father of Queen Elizabeth.  Anyway it is a great movie.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|I gave this three stars because there was some measure of excitement in the special effects. Fortunately, I didn't really expect much, so I wasn't entirely disappointed, but unless one is a die-hard superhero fan, I would recommend spending one's bucks elsewhere. The guy who played Supe was no Chris Reeve. And it went downhill from there. Lois Lane was TERRIBLE; I've never been a big fan of Margot Kidder, but at least she gave the character personality. In fact, that was probably the problem with the entire move: the characters were just going through the motions. Russell Crowe as Jor-el and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent? I'm surprised they didn't cast Keanu as the Man of Steel, and complete the roster of wooden retreads.
B006CHML4I|1.0|Was awesome for the first month then died.  The look and feel is rugged yet it began losing time after 3 weeks and I almost missed my flight home from Africa!  By the time I made it home it wasn't working at all.  Very disappointed in this Seiko product.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A quality look at the history surrounding Christ's life--no earth shattering new discoveries, just solid scholarship to help the reader understand the social context of first century Palestine. It is well written, easy to understand for those who are not into the esoterics of religion and respectful to those who have faith in more than just the historical Jesus.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|One of the songs is warped.  I should have returned it to you but I threw away the bill to do so.  I like GAGA but not a warped cd sent to me.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is so addicting. Doesn't require much thinking, really, it's just a lovely little time-waster. Beautiful graphics, too. The sound effects are nice as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again Mr. Grisham has hit a home run!  I loved going back to visit A Time to Kill.  I will say that I began to suspect the answer to the mystery close to the middle of the book, but that didn't deflect my desire to continue to read on. Mr. Grisham expertly weaves the characters together, each one believable in their own right.  Bravo!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Does what it's supposed to. Clean, user-friendly interface. Reminds me of Windows Explorer. Easy to navigate and I like that it has additional applets (I suppose one can call them applets) that are useful and functional.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Just love the Winchesters. So much action, drama, and evilness to make you wanting to watch each episode until the last disk
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm a big fan of Ken Follet's Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. I have enjoyed this installment in his century trilogy. I enjoy the historical context of these books as told through the characters. I very much look forward to the final chapter of this series.
B00D48BT5A|4.0|Interesting, informative and humorous - even enjoyed the baseball stories even though its not a sport I follow or know much about. A great eye opener about the 1920s and the state of the nation. Bought Bryson's other book At Home right after reading 1927 and am really enjoying that as well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Terrible writing = by a 12 yeaar old?  Ridiculous subject unless you are under 21 and have led an extremely sheltered life including no access to newspapers, TV, social media, the library, modern movies for 17 and under, etc.  Just how ignorant is the public?
B000002GYR|5.0|This is my favorite Tom Waits album. I've always had it on vinyl but wanted to add it to my collection on cd as well. And it was a great price so I had to get it. Tom's an old friend I've never met and he's kept me company many a day. Thank you Tom. Your artistry is appreciated.
B008476HBM|5.0|Though the plot sounds very boring, the love lives of some sisters, the way that Austen writes the book makes you yearn to read more and more! This book is a classic for a reason!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|works well on my Kendal - I wish they had it earlier! Good grafics and loads quickly. I love to beat my friends!
B0049H9NVW|5.0|I do not even know where to begin with this game. The art work is amazing, the game play is solid ( a combination of role selection, Tile laying, and set collection) , and the theme shines out so well in this one. I have played this one countless times, and I never get sick of it. The rules are simple to explain, turns and game play go quick, and the game length is not significantly changed when going from two to four played, although three seems to be this games sweet spot.This is a game I suggest to every one, and the game is one that anyone could play regardless of age children to adult everyone loves this game which has affectionately become known simply as &#34;The Panda Game&#34; with my gaming group. definitely a must have.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so addictive. Im a girl who is almost thirteen, and i love this game. Is that weird...?
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Great little filler game reminds me very much of Pass the Pigs except the dice are not difficult to read. Always a go to, and never too long. If you are looking for a filler game that is just long enough this is it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its like temple run except 5000000 times better.  It is better than temple run and subway surfers combined.  My favorite game!!!!!!
0385537131|5.0|It doesn't mater what John Grisham writes, I will purchase each book.  I am a fan and will continue to read everything Grisham puts out!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is definitely a five star book due to its authors creativity. Overall, there's no book I would recommend more this. Even the movie can't compare!
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|All the adults and children have tried it, none of us have made a bracelet, the directions are terrible!  Sad that I bought this as a Christmas gift.  I am adding this a few days after my original review....after watching several youtube videos, my kids did figure out how to make 2 types of bracelets, but if you make one mistake, the bracelet falls apart.  Very delicate process, too complicated for younger kids.  I would say 9+.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Horrible ending !!! I'm still very hopelless and sad  after reading it !!! I was so excited about the movie coming up but after readng this last book I dont even watch it anymore !  This book is a real good example of how to destroy such a good trilogy! I dont understand why writers need to kill their main characters to say that their books shows reality , because it's awful. The problem is not even killing the main characters but the way they die...I'm so disappointed and angry with this book . i'm not gonna buy anytihng more form this serie !!! It's over for me!!! If I had known I would have stopped on the second !!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very fun n gets a little addicting it works great on my kindle fire.. i just think they should give u more than 5 lifes but thats the only downside...
B00CKR63F2|5.0|A very beautiful piece of journey written with lots of innovativeness.I just fell in love with the line &#34;Oria, my little Golden Queen&#34;..Obviously, the characters and the scenes mark the base-line for the story and fit perfectly. A thorough relaxed collection to choose if you want to enjoy the ride of mystic land.
0887081770|5.0|this is a must have book for children along with all of Eric Carle.  My 7 year old grandson has this book memorized.  I was expecting it to be a large book, but it is actually quite small and can fit in your purse.  It is easy for the kids to handle and the pictures are precious and such a good story.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|It loads really super slow but i world really like to play it, loved the movie and i want to play but cant&hellip; please fix that, (and the doesnt mean up the price)
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Finally a great hidden object/adventure game from G5.  It's be awhile.  I'm so glad to see this released.  Please continue to release these types of games.  I purchase these types of games immediately when they become available.  Thank you for hours of great entertainment.
0553582011|5.0|Arrived within a day - and a brand new copy.  We are totally into the series. And since it is a large book we can now take our time reading. Sent the library book back.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|The fact that this app is free only adds to its awesomeness. I have recommended it to my friends and we are learning French together. It is<br />A must to download
B003B02O0A|5.0|First Grisham book I read. Loved starting to read all, next is new book Sycamore Row. Will be a Grisham fan
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Really have not had the opportunity to use it much but it seems durable and has the ability to last a good while
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Read this after I read Time to Kill,so those characters were still fresh in my mind. These two books made me a Grisham fan. What took me so long to discover?
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I could spend years writing down my thoughts and feelings (so many feelings!) about Allegiant but I'll just give my main thoughts.<br /><br />No major spoilers<br /><br />I'd seen a lot of reviews from people saying how this is such a bad book and how they hated the ending and you shouldn't even read Allegiant and just make up your own ending. But I don't feel like any of those things are true. I feel like those are all things from people who didn't get what they wanted and are just bitter.<br /><br />There's not denying that Veronica Roth is a wonderful writer. One of the best. She's created something that millions of people have opened their hearts and book selves to. And that's something special. The choices and decisions she made when writing Allegaint are really brave and while Allegaint didn't leave me happy and singing songs about love, I feel like Allegiant has made it's mark on me and I won't be forgetting it any time soon (or ever).<br /><br />Allegiant gets right to the point, right away, from page one. And it doesn't slow down until the end.<br />I really liked the pace.<br /><br />Of course the characters are great. If your reading this review, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you've already read the other two books in the series.<br /><br />Roth makes a lot of big moves before page 100. Moves I haven't seen from a writer since J.K Rowling. Roth and Rowling are almost two of the same.<br /><br />I feel like Roth really has created a world that is believable and realistic. In the real world, not all the good guys are going to make it. No matter how much you love someone, they can still die.<br /><br />I like how Roth really explored what happened in the past that created the world that up this series. We get to learn a lot more about what led up to the Fractions and what happened to the US.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't like was the scientific reason behind why people are Divergent. I think what really appealed to a lot of people about this series is how anyone can be Divergent. How anyone can be brave, smart, honest, and selfless. But the reasoning that being Divergent is just in your DNA, it kinda messes up the whole concept of the series, in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I feel like this is a really good ending to this series. I still feel a little shell shocked from the whole book (I read the whole thing in 24 hours. And it has 526 pages). One of the things that proves that a work of fiction is great (to me) is when, at some point, it makes me cry.<br />If it can bring that out of me, it means it made an impact one me. And Allegiant made an impact on me, more then once.<br /><br />All I can say is, you might not like the ending of this series or you might like it. I don't know and I can't say for sure how everyone is going to feel. But if you start reading with an open mind like I did, you'll make it though this roller coaster.es is how anyone can be Divergent. How anyone can be brave, smart, honest, and selfless.

B00422LESO|5.0|This was a super fun read. The idea of  escaping to regency area vacation was clever and charming.  Jane finally became her own heroine.
0525478817|5.0|I had not heard of the vlogbrothers before I picked up this book. Therefore, I had no idea who John Green was. And although I can understand the point of the negative reviews, I absolutely adored this book. &#34;The Fault in our Stars&#34; made me think about what's important in life. I love John Green's tone and the way he thinks.This book made me become a huge John Green fan, and I'm so glad I read it.<br /><br />I think what I like most about Hazel Grace and Augustus is their uniqueness (as compared to what society deems &#34;normal.) Besides the fact that they both have cancer, they clearly don't fit in. Hazel Grace and Augustus have old souls, and that's what connects them to one another. I recommend this book to absolutely everyone. &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; should become a modern classic. :)
B009LDCXNY|5.0|A few so-so flashbacks aside, this is a fairly decent season, with Dean and a very dysfunctional Cass getting out of Purgatory, a new avenging angel called Naomi, Crowley being meaner than ever, the return of Meg, the hilarious and likeable Charlie, new prophet Kevin Tran, and more of a focus on heaven and hell even than before.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Awesome show! I've been waiting for a show like this. I can't wait to see what the spin off will be like.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game evar<br /><br />Rice is YouTube ruffneck remix of the castle guardian on f and nice sprites skrillex scary monsters and nice sprites skrillex scary monsters and nice sprites skrillex scary monsters and nice sprites skrillex scary monsters and nice sprites skrillex
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Just started this game and I love it.  A new favorite.  I am going to recommend this game to all my friends.  I like that I can play on it for a longer period of time than most.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cute timesink<br />Not too difficult not too easy free app I play about once a week<br /><br />Well Worth the money.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Horrible... This app works but it constantly force closes the app and when i try to watch a video it tells me &quot;vTube has stopped&quot;. Please fix this or make an update
B0028ER4QE|3.0|I chose this rating for one reason. The doors album I had recieved was edited for content on the first song side one. I am not very happy with the censorship of an artist. Let alone one of the greatest artists of all time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Does get difficult if you don't buy boosters. Hate the jelly stages. But otherwise I will keep on playing! Good balance with life regeneration - you have to give the game a break!
0307891372|4.0|Skyrim is one of those games where it's sort of impossible to do a real &#34;walkthrough&#34; style guide.  It's a completely open world, and there are some things that you are allowed to do (sometimes even encouraged to do) that will make other choices rather difficult or impossible.  This guide does a pretty good job on equipping you with maps and lists of which quests can be found in each area and the conditions to complete them, as well as a listing of what is expected of you for the &#34;main game quest&#34; series of tasks.  So don't treat this as a step-by-step instruction manual for beating the game.  Instead think of it as a reference guide, like an encyclopedia, that you will use to look up certain things as you work your way across the land in Skyrim.
1451695195|1.0|Oh what a world we live in. This book is called PROOF of Heaven, and after reading every single page of it, I could not even find a single scrap of objective evidence, let alone the PROOF it proclaims in the title. We are essentially just supposed to take the doctor's word that his brain was \\"shut down\\", (even though there is no evidence presented that it was), But even if we give him that, we are then asked to accept his word alone, that he KNOWS that his visions happened during this time, and not before, while his brain was declining, or later, as his brain was rebooting. How could he possibly know such a thing? Of course he couldn't possibly. But none the less just look at the reviews on  this book. This is a failure of critical thinking that can best be described as biblical in its proportions, as well as it's cause. Look no further than the mindless positive reviews of this book, if you are at all interested in why the US is incapable of solving it's problems at the moment. The slippery slope of blind faith has been taken to it's very bottom by many, where actual reality becomes meaningless, and desire is all there is when it comes to what is true. This is not the way to progress as a species, it's regression pure and simple.
B0028K31CE|5.0|Great comeback album!! One of the few CD's I can listen to without skipping a song.  Can't wait until Summer and Night are released!
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies and, is one I will watch over and over.  Because its comprised of 6 story lines connected by themes, its a movie that requires dedication to viewing. I couldn't watch this and do the dishes. The first half hour or so is necessarily confusing as the 6 story lines and characters are developed.  Most of the actors play a multitude of roles and the acting is superb.<br /><br />From my perspective, it deals with karma, reincarnation, the importance of the individual, the power an individual has to make change and, with perseverance, create the extraordinary. It explores human devolution and the importance of critical thinking to mans' evolution. This movie applauds truth seekers and epic scale whistle blowers.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|A quick reading story, at just under 150 pages this little mystery had plenty to enjoy! And, as an avid collector of recipes with my cozies, the added recipes were just the right flavor for a quiet afternoon of baking and reading!<br /><br />Lexy has just discovered that someone has died after eating one of her popular treats from her shop. Of course, she knows the victim, and the fact that he’s her ex-boyfriend instantly puts her in the list of suspects.  More importantly, her business is in jeopardy, and everyone must try to discover the culprit before Lexy is wrongly convicted.<br /><br />Full of clever characters including a grandmother with an affinity for technology and sleuthing, the mystery wasn’t too complex, but the interactions between characters and the light and fun storyline that moved forward kept me entertained and turning pages.  As an introduction to the series, this is a great hello, and sure to please fans who like a light, fun and not so angst-filled mystery to while away their afternoon.<br /><br />I purchased this eBook for my own personal library.  I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.
B002KREVE2|4.0|We have seen him a few times, this is a great recording rough as it is and now you can appreciate how far he has come as a troubadour (spelling). Like a wine he has only gotten better with age!!!!
B009MYARIK|5.0|When Lottie met Richard for lunch, she thought he was going to propose, but he didn’t. Lottie was crushed, totally heartbroken, but assured her older sister Fliss that all was well, even though that was far from the truth.<br />Lottie, on the rebound, met up with her boyfriend (Ben) from her college days and within a short time agreed to marry him. Fliss’s job, as the big sister, was to make sure that didn’t transpire.  What occurred next will take you on a whirlwind trip as Fliss attempts to make sure that Lottie and Ben never marry.  However, just when she thinks she has the situation under control, she finds out that Ben and Lottie got married and are packed and leaving for Greek island where they met so many years before and Lottie is hoping to get pregnant on her honeymoon.  That can’t happen if Fliss wants Lottie to have the marriage annulled.  Will Fliss stop the marriage before it is consummated?<br />Intertwined with Lottie’s story is Fliss’s story. Fliss has recently gone through a painful divorce and thinks her motivation is to protect Lottie from the same lot in life.  But is it?<br />Sophie Kinsella’s WEDDING NIGHT was a both a quick read and a highly entertaining story.  It is filled with humor (I laughed out loud the whole time I was reading it), romance, and many surprising events.  I would positively recommend WEDDING NIGHT.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so awesome you get a awesome car for the level that you are on and when you are on  the level well you will just have to find out yourself.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Good book but not his best work. His skills have eroded (as do all writers) with age. He still tells a good but not great tale.
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|My favorite story  from the Brontes and without a doubt the truest depiction of  this wonderful classic.  If you haven't seen it you must get it.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|Excellent. As usual from David Garrett, astoundingly wonderful, unique music. You won't be disappointed with your purchase. He is just a great talent.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 1/2 yr old Grandson Loves cars and Trucks and all things mechanical especially in puzzle form.  Great fun for him.
B003O86MY8|5.0|My favorite of David Garrett's albums. I play it over and over again. Amazon requires a lot of text here and I have nothing else to say...
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|This game is very fun! It's awesome how you get to play as Thor and fight battles. The graphics are very good as well. The only reason I gave it four stars is because sometimes it gets extremely difficult in an attempt to make you use real money, which is not necessary. Overall great game!
B00127RAJY|5.0|It'll do the job. Quick shipping. Of course I haven't tried it yet. But it made me feel good to buy it, then pretend like I was going to exercise.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great show. Great love the show watch every 1. it is the only show i watch on TV. the reason i dont watch TV is because of the commercials and when i buy ncis i have no commercials.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I have this on my galaxy s4 and am so glad to finally have it on my kindle!  Most addictive game.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|Thrilled.  I'm a collector of all things Twilight.  I do own the movies but I wanted to add to my collection.  The holding case is beautiful.  They made it sturdy and the pictures on the case are awesome . Very pleased.  Very easy to store.  So happy.
1439190976|5.0|My husband, myself and son are  and were in the service industry, ie, account, consultant, financial consulting etc. and we are quite interested in the many aspects of the story
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez life  story is facinating, and his music is deeply meaningful. He is the only artist I have been listening to since I purchased both of his CDs a few month ago. He is truly a great discovery for me. Great for any age. Absolutely love it !
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I really like the album, especially the duet with Johnny Mathis.  Their voices are beautiful together. I wish the Carpenters'  Merry Christmas Darling had been selected for the album.  Susan would have done a very good job with that Christmas song.  On another note, we waited all year for this album and, as much as I like Christmas music, I do not want to hear it all year.  I was hoping that her next album would have some music we could enjoy anytime.  So, I would suggest that you get back in the studio and make another album as soon as possible.  And let Susan sing something upbeat.  I know I heard her say that she was not a rock and roll singer, but there are definitely a lot of rock and roll songs and jazz songs that Susan can sing, and sing very well.  Let her sing some of those songs she sung during her concerts this past summer.  Her voice is very versatile, let her show it off!!!  Having said all that, I love Susan, and will be playing the album all during the holidays.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez is my favorite artist. Everyone in my family fell in love with his life story and the songs.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Dickens' works are the heart of Western literature. Brilliantly crafted and full of memorable characters, his books are the pinnacle of Western literature. NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is the most uplifting, A TALE OF TWO CITIES his best social commentary.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I would never hunt in real life but this game is really fun! Has good graphics. Everyone should try it out. It's free. :)
B008C20TDG|5.0|Two of my family members changed their lives by using this plan! It worked..one lost 80 and the other 125.  So, now they've convinced me and my daughter to join the healthy lifestyle eating.  Day 1 today 11/23/13  Thank you Melissa
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this game and I fell in love with it I was so attracted to this game awesome game by
B002VPE1WK|5.0|For a fraction of the cost of other bags I bought this one and love it.<br />I also purchased a backpack cover if it rains.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book is incredibly boring and repetitious. Even the erotica portions. It felt  very mechanical just to insert some titillation and  not part of a story. The story is so simplistic and I never felt that I cared about the characters at all.
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|First, I love watching Shakespeare...not so much reading it...but watching it - LOVE IT. Be aware - the movie is in black and white. This is the Joss Whedon doing one of my all time favorites - Much Ado About Nothing - with some of my favorite Whedonites - Amy Acker, Alexis Denisof, Nathan Fillion, Clark Gregg and Sean Maher - just to name a few!  Seeing how Whedon put a modern twist on a classic, is great!!  And knowing that they filmed this entire movie in such a short period of time...makes it even more enjoyable and tells me how great the actors/directors/producers really are. If you like Shakespeare, then this movie is a MUST!!!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|One of the best.  Check out the post scripts which show how many Computer Generated scenes were used and how long it took to complete the movie.  Judie Dench is still great.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Great show.  There is a pattern that becomes apparent across most of the episodes that make it a little predictable.  I am told Season 2 provides some interesting twists to the story line which may compensate for the commonality between episodes.  We definitely continue watching.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written, historically correct, and it teaches Americans how to communicate with honor and dignity.  It has a great plot as well.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Enjoyed reading \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" however, I prefer Khaled Hosseini's first two books. Nevertheless, it was a good book, and I recommend it to a friend.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A nice translation from the French with a bit too much historical background.  The excitement builds from prison to a life on the run.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|...And whereas some of his collaborations are a mixed bag, there's not a mediocre track in this inspired match-up with The Roots...even the bonus tracks are great. All of it sounds totally fresh, but there's quite a few touches in the stellar production that harken back to Elvis' sound and vibe from his earlier work. Highly recommended.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|The concert footage is great, sound quality very good, it is nice to see them. The song selections are very good.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|...as the 1st single grabbed my attention...along with the names of everyone he was working with. Don't get me wrong, it has it's moments, especially tunes like &#34;Early Days&#34;, but a few seem unfinished, or as in the case of &#34;Queenie Eye&#34;, start off great and throw in some odd break that kinda kills the momentum. I wasn't expecting another &#34;Ram&#34;, one the greatest and most-underrated albums of all time, but was at least hoping for really good one. This one's merely okay.
B00001ODGR|5.0|It is a well done set, audio quality is excellent, the tribute to John was nice and if you like Styx it is a good thing to have.
B00DQT1EOI|5.0|The cases and the approach helps you to develop your understand of why big data is so important to todays businesses and how to approach it with your company or client.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Keeps you up at night after watching. Big SW fan. Reserection is a good finale. Worth the money. Bye Bye
B001TH16DI|4.0|Not a very good restoration. Some parts of Star Trek the motion picture show that the master it came from has some wear.<br />The VHS my mother got back in the 1980's is cleaner as it was transferred from the master soon after the movie left the theaters.<br />The newer the movie the less wear to the point where the master has not enough wear to show up.<br />The Captains summit is a nice attention. However it's not so much a captains summit as it is just William Shatner with Leonard Nemoy (Of TOS) and Patrick stewart with Jonathan franks of TNG. None of the other captains however as this box set only represents the movies starting ToS crew so the absence is justified as is the fact that it's whoopi goldberg doing the interviews so she's focused on the people she knew. The star trek she grew up with and the star trek she acted in.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|True story, told exceptionally well. Ridley ( director )  & Steve ( writer ) are on top of their game...as are the leads and all the supporting casts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you amazon for finally getting this on the kindle!! I love this game. Runs great! The whole family enjoys playing it.
B00FQMVCEA|3.0|Very nice animation with many details - but the story is a bit simple. Just fun to watch, although nothing to die for.
B004FQX5D4|1.0|The movie is great if you are wondering about the content. The DVD itself received one star because we ordered two copies through Amazon which were both defective. Everything went smoothly with the exchange the first time and the return the second time, but they left us with no reassurance that the third DVD would arrive undamaged. The shrink wrap was melted to the DVD on the second one, and I think the whole batch of DVD's was defective. I told the service rep that they should check with their vendor and the DVD's themselves, but it seemed like too much of a hassle for them. It was also too much of a hassle for me to continue the exchanges back and forth, so we ended up without this DVD. We will order from a different seller on Amazon or a different website altogether.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The options and customizations are cool, graphics are okay. Similar to the first PlayStation or Xbox. Recommend buying if your on a long road trip, or waiting in a waiting room. Good racing game
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I'm either too old for this, or don't understand what to do with it.  I don't know which, but I know I got nothing out of this.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie all around. Entertaining, exciting, suspencful fun that keeps you glued to the screen. A must see if you like this genre!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|The first three actually had the right amount of pacing, action, and drama that made me a fan of the series. The last two books... it just seems like it was written by a different author. This book drags for almost 1,000 pages and was broken up by areas with it's sister book, ADWD (I don't get the reasoning behind that...).<br /><br />Anywho, this book and the following seems like blatant attempts to stall the series and make more money. This author sold out. I read a news article that he was sick of fans telling him to finish this series and saying that he was a slow writer. I'd be slow too if I was putting out cookbooks, selling books solely on Tyrion (which looks he just copied and pasted what that character has already said...), and all the other crap that prevents me from actually writing the story. Actually, his last two books actually reflect himself in real life in that nothing of what the fans want is getting accomplished.<br /><br />Oh well, it was a really good first three books. I hope he changes back to his previous style in the next book, otherwise I'll probably cut my losses and stop buying. But that's just me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app. It brings out the creative side in everyone. With this app you can play with your friends on the same world! You can even create your world with seeds! You really should get this app!;D
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I will always love Jack Reacher books, he's great to read and storylines always hold my interest. 61 Hours still my fav though.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app works well, it hasn't ever crashed on me or anything. I've been having trouble with watching youtube videos on the kindle fire browser but on this app I have no problem watching videos at all.
B0086DBE62|2.0|This should have been a fantastic movie that is high underrated. It had all of the elements to make this a new enchanting story that brought down the house. It did not. I really wanted to enjoy this. Sadly, I did not. I just didn't like it.<br /><br />I think Julia Roberts made a good queen. The queen and the costumes were the best part about the movie.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|This is a great piece of xbox but unfortunately my living room is to small. My son needs to get it in one angle to play. But at the end it is nice to play and interact with the game.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is one of my favorite all-time movies and definitely my favorite Miyazaki film. My brother bought it for me a long time ago and I lost it so I bought it again.<br /><br />It is weird but fantastic. To me, this is one of the best creations and well told stories to come from Studio Ghibli.
1401234542|5.0|Geoff Johns put this series back on the map. It's just a great vol.1 of 3..and the other 2 you'll buy if you read this one
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was waiting on this book release for a month and all I received was disappointment. I have never been more disappointed and incensed by a book or series before. I was left depressed and infuriated. And I took all my anger on my family by ranting about this for weeks.<br /><br />I have concluded that the author and I are in completely different places. It turns out that the story I thought I was reading wasn't what I was really reading after all.<br /><br />I didn't understand Allegiant. I completely disliked the whole middle portion. And yes, if the ending had been different it could have saved it but just barely.<br /><br />The characters that I knew and loved suddenly possessed different attributes. I didn't know these characters anymore. They were behaving uncharacteristically. The main plot was interesting but mishandled and junkie with too much information. In the book, everyone jumped to conclusions and screwed everything up. I stopped reading dozens of times asking myself, &#34;did HE just really do THAT?&#34;. No no no.<br /><br />Oh wanted to love this. I wanted to drown in this, see the movies, scream &#34;DIVERGENT&#34; from my car window as I drove passed innocent pedestrians, walk down the street wearing the apparel like I owned the street; owned ALL the streets.<br /><br />Here, the author and I diverge.<br />I cannot continue on this road.<br />I like the author but I did not like this book.<br />This is not the story I thought I knew.<br />And it's not just because this story didn't end on a high note. And to clarify: ending bitter/sweet or solemnly does not make it more realistic. This story didn't make sense. It felt like the writing conspired to end up badly. It didn't feel natural. The ending felt empty of purpose and impact.<br /><br />I could go on forever, but I will stop here.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|It is clear by now that Bruno Mars is here to stay as the go-to guy for catchy top 50 Billboard smash hits. But on this album, he flexes his songwriting muscle as he puts together a solid album that shows off his diversity as an artist. Songs like &#34;Locked Out Of Heaven&#34; and &#34;Treasure&#34; are the usual Bruno Mars easily digestible pop music (There's a reason these were the first two singles), and while these songs are fine, this album truly shines when Bruno takes a whimsical departure and makes a song that is legitimately funny. Songs like &#34;Nathalie&#34; and &#34;Money Make Her Smile&#34; are going to put a quick smile on your face. &#34;Gorilla&#34; is probably the albums most interesting track, although it has a very sexy tone, the lyrics make it very funny as well. If you enjoy the songs I've mentioned here then you owe it to yourself to take a journey through Bruno Mars latest album.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The first time I attempted to read this I absolutely HATED IT.<br />I gave it a dozen more tries.<br /><br />It took me a moment to appreciate the lyrical style of the writing. I am an atmosphere and detail junkie. I love when the writer paints a vivid picture in my mind. The Book Thief gripped me in an unusual way and seared not images but words, beautiful sentences, starting passages, jokes, German obscenities (Saumensch, Saukerl, and Arschloch), and wonderful fables through my flesh and into my bones.<br /><br />It was a good story. There were some truly excellent parts of this book and I became a little misty twice.<br /><br />There's a reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars. There were a few elements that didn't sit quite so well with me, but that doesn't matter much. It's still a good book. Not everyone will like it. I understand why some people love it and why others didn't.
B006P0FIGU|3.0|When this movie first came out in theaters I wanted to see it because of the trailers which showed Mill Jovovich sword fighting; however, it did not get great ratings and I decided to wait until the film was out on DVD.  I purchased this film for a bargain price and I viewed it last night.  Though it had its moments, with some great but too short sword scenes, I was a little disappointed.<br /><br />You would think that with stars such as Milla Jovovich (Who I love in the Resident Evil series etc.), Orlando Blood, Logan Lerman and Christophe Walz the movie should have been great.  It shows the importance of having good screen writers and a more compelling story line is to making a movie a success.<br /><br />One of the ways I use to judge a movie and decide whether it is a great, good, fair or bad movie is as follows:  A great movie is the kind I know I will view over and over again and still enjoy it.  A good movie I usually want to see at least twice.  A fair movie is one in which one  time viewing is enough.  A  bad movie rating is one that is  a total waste of  time viewing.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an okay movie but not in anyway memorable.<br /><br />Rating:  3 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale  (Author: Never Trust a Politician: A critical review of politics and politicians)<br /><br />In conclusion,
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It's pretty fun so far. I don't like to spend money on in game purchases so it'll take me a lot longer to get through. I feel like there could be a little more middle ground for people who don't lime to continually fork over money to make progress.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|After reading about The Shield and how this show made later shows like The Sopranos and Breaking Bad possible, both shows I loved, I wanted to watch The Shield which I hadn't seen when it was on originally. I've only watched a few episodes so far, but I am finding it well written, well acted, and quite good. I will continue with watching it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|When I saw that the movie was coming out, I decided to five in and finally read the book. I have always been a science fiction fan and suddenly found myself enthralled in this story of a very young man with an old soul.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Excellent story- life-like and believable.  Denzel is such a great actor.  You can go from tears to laughter as he brings the emotions to you.
B008602KQI|4.0|the acting in the movie is superb. Just the right balance of action and story. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Everything about middleearth is wonderfully done.  I love and have everything so far and look forward to the release of the second part this December
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great book for youth and adults alike.  If only we could all live by the precept, &#34;be kinder than necessary&#34; what a difference it would make in this world.  Three cheers for Auggie Pullman&#34;.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is fun, there's no energy used on it so you can complete more actions at a time.  Wish there were fewer tasks that required trading goods to friends but still very enjoyable.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Secrets have a way of being compounding and changing a life.  An easy read for all with good character development.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great, easy to install....if you have a use for it GET THIS.  I don't use it as much as I thought I would but i'll start incorporating it more and more.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesome I thought it was gonna be dumb but definatley the best app I have had in a long time I highly recommend it!!
B002IVLH60|5.0|Great album if you are a jammer you will find this album to be like some of their first track when they where just starting out.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|Very crisp paint and details and it was way cheaper for the original japanese version than the preorder on gamestop.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|This book is a good reminder to anyone with success that focused.hard.work.and.dedication are what it means to have and achieve success
B005K17RU0|1.0|I really get tired of applications that prompt you for reviews. It seems like they get you when you are in the middle of a bunch of stuff and you need to check something really quick. Suddenly there are pop ups and prompts and you feel like the whole thing is just wasting your time.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Bought this for my 9 year old son and he loves it! He put in together all by himself and it took him about 1 1/2 hours.  But the parts are very very very small
B00EC7GRS6|5.0|Don't listen to all the complaints about this dock.  It works just as advertised.  There is no fiddling to get it to work, it works the first time.  As another reviewer said, put the phone in the dock and slide the phone to the center and the magnetic connector connects every time.
B008M721MS|1.0|Skype crashes when the kindle rotates. If I´m not in the proper rotation Skype wants when starting, it stops loading at the blue screen. Bugs like this should be caught long before they get released to users.
B002N57KG2|1.0|It was about a bunch of people racing across country to see who got to CA first/the fastest no matter how fast they drove etc.<br /><br />Stupid movie. bad acting. moronic lines/writing. This was just horrible. If someone had not told me what this movie was about then I would never have figured it out until the movie was half way over because it was just a bunch of people doing and saying anything. Even the jokes were lame.<br /><br />Even the &#34;bloopers&#34; on the DVD showed just how lame the actors were and what &#34;they&#34; thought was funny.<br /><br />I can see why this was $5 and why I barely even remember the movie.
B00008CLNQ|5.0|For the combination of sound and mastery, this twofer is easily the best Brahms cycle on the market. Symphonies 1-3 are remastered versions of the late 80's cycle and the 4th if from the late 70's. I guess the late 80's 4th was excluded because of Karajan's decline in health.<br /><br />Excluding SFL, the other reviewers here offer some rather idiotic advice, going so far as to compare Karajan's Brahms symphonies to Abbado's. Its offensive to people who actually care about Brahms. Ignore them.<br /><br />Only Furtwangler can rival Karajan.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|Fun ghost app.  The spoken words are a little spooky.  I like the recording feature that automatically records words and energy hits.  I find it interesting that words are spoken when the energy level is high.  I will use this app, plus regular ghost radar next time I hunt ghosts.
B00CN3R2DK|5.0|The doll it's wonderfulll ... The dress is gorgeus... No speak.... The faces is like an angel!! Who loves audrey have to had !!!!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is one of my go-to game apps when I want to destress and clear the mind chatter.  The game is easy and you can play with as much strategy as you prefer.  Good graphics and nice play.
B00AEBB8BA|5.0|Excellent movie, so much attention to detail when it comes to weapon handling, and the art of shooting at long ranges. Plus all the survival stuff is off the top...
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Maysa is not given credit for her talent based on what's so called acceptable. You will never see her on a show with Beyonce because she would make her look crazy.  Maysa sings no screaming!
B00E9A656K|5.0|I love it so much and i dont find anything wrong with it. It does have 1 issue thought and thats when i try to update it, it takes forever and then tells me i have low storage when i dont.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I thought it was poorly written, motivations for the various characters unconvincing, and all credible  intentions as a serious author cast in doubt by her naming two of the sisters Poly and Esther.  How cute is that?  Her repeated use of the phrase \\"she went to.\\"...do so and so what ever it was seemed very poor usage as well as all the talk about \\"packing the dishwasher\\".  I thought suitcases were packed and dishwashers (and guns) were loaded.  A few references to items that would only be meaningful to Aussies were noted, along with the lack of explanation.  The ending was totally unsatisfying. I will avoid anything by this author in the future.
0385512104|5.0|This was our neighborhood book club selection, and I was glad I bought it to keep in my collection rather than my usual library check out.  As a former special education teacher who currently works with young autistic children, I was quite taken by its authenticity.  It turned out to be a much better book club selection than many had anticipated.  Love this book!
B00GIZO674|5.0|This is the best burger game in the appstore! I highly recommend it. It keeps you on your feet, has funny tips, and has awesome powerups and items to add to your little burger shop. If you're looking for an awesome food app, stop looking. This is so good it should be sold for millions! But it's free, so GET IT!!!!
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Roger Ebert got it right:  it is both entertaining and poignant as it captures a piece of musical and social history.  I was one of the legion who &#34;almost went&#34;; this makes me feel I am there but with a perspective far beyond me at that time.  I'm sure this is a set I will watch again, to revisit a time that echoes on:  music IS memory.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Loved the story in this one. Great movies with a great leading star. Love all things &#34;Tom Selleck&#34;. He is the greatest.
B008JFUNNM|5.0|Like his earlier &#34;Flight 93&#34;, despite knowing how it turns out, the director has produced a tension filled retelling of the story everyone thinks they know. Good acting by all. An ocean to avoid.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Great movies with a great actor. I love all Tom Selleck moves. I have the full set of these now.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Stick with this one. At first you feel it might be just the same old high school movie, but this is the real thing. Fine actors and writing, mixed with emotion and honesty. Not since John Hughes has a movie gotten so much about those teen days right. Got to see this.
B00CZ7OC46|5.0|I'm part of a small startup time of 5 working from home.  This book validated a lot of what we do and gave heaps of new ideas for us to work on!  Thanks guys!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|You have to be patient and wait to accumulate XP points or coins unless you want to shell out real money to play. Par for the course with any Zynga game.
B00CC1JXYE|5.0|This is a unique S-View case. It makes phone look elegant and professional. Also, it lets you use your original phone back cover and offers protection as well to the sides and back of the phone.  The S-view window is clear glass and the leather is of high quality. Overall workmanship is excellent. The slots are perfectly cut and you can take pics without folding the back cover and exposing phone camera( back of the cover is foldable for landscape mode viewing, like tablet covers). The magnetic interference is minimal and does not affect compass accuracy unlike most S-View covers.  Only thing I would expect is that protection should extend to top and bottom as well, although the leather does cover them adequately. Good value for your money.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A fast and riveting read! Katniss is a memorable protagonist. I enjoyed being in Collins' world. Four more words ... Done!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Works fine on the kindle. As far as fun goes it is just a typical &quot;Ville&quot; game. Time to make things are reasonable, easy to follow and learn. graphics are fine and haven't had any pro le s with freezing or lagging.
B0000203YT|4.0|Love the movie. Everything about it seem to work. I love period pieces. A moving motion picture. Seen it dozens of times.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Jim Carrey need i say more! This movie has a good twist on the usual films jim carrey stars in
B00B5HQL50|3.0|As Bond movies go, it is very entertaining.  As movies go, the actual plot a is ALL screwed up.  The basic premise, a missing hard drive of sensitive info is the main opening sequence, and the reason for 007's involvement, but then we never hear about the hard drive again after the first 10 minutes.  Confusing.  Great action, but it seems extremely contrived.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|What can i say its funny to no end! the whole cast was GREAT!!!! Tim Allen once again is hilarious
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is a very entertaining show. Lots of action. It's great for any fan of graphic novels. I would recommend it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this to finally get to the Kindle. I'm totally LOVING IT!!! I'm so happy!!! Hated having to start over from the iPad.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|&#34;...[A] mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.&#34; And that is how Lord Tyrion Lannister suddenly became my new favorite character. Vulgar, profane, drunken, and whoring, he is nonetheless highly intelligent and witty. As nothing has been expected of him since he was born a dwarf, &#34;The Imp&#34; steals the show. Whether Martin intends for him to become a hero later in the series &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; is yet to be seen UNLESS you have been watching the hit series on HBO. I have only watched up to the end of this book and want to read ahead before watching any more.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin has been writing commercially for a very long time; he sold his first story in 1971. As such, he is no &#34;overnight hit.&#34; It seems that readers either love him or hate him, and I fall into the first camp. There are plenty of fantasy sword-and-sorceror books out there to read but this seemed to be simple yet complex all at the same time. It reminded me of a very drinkable wine; easy to go down but with lingering complex after-notes of flavor. The after-notes are rich and varied. What will eventually become of Arya? Will she become the mighty swordsman that seems to be her destiny? Will Lord Tyrion be able to restore sanity to rule in the capitol? Will the weird snow-zombies invade from the north? And what of Daenerys and dragons?<br /><br />The book comes equipped with an appendix of the mighty houses of the realm to help readers decipher who is killing whom. I only wish that it had been more apparent in my Kindle edition; and yet I was able to put the relationships together without it. I found that I wanted to keep turning the pages and that after finishing, I am still interested enough to invest the time in reading the second book of the series. Friends tell me I am looking at a significant investment in time, but I'm willing to go along for the ride.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's new to me. I enjoy the challenge, but don't like the time limit on playing. Also, I ordered the .99cent app, but can't find it, so can't use it.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|Pros:<br /><br />Easy to use<br />Does not burn my hands when I use the handle<br />Safe<br />Does what it was intended to do<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />A bit small for a Jumbo Joe, perfect for anything smaller
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game, like to play on my portable device, wish I could make money and crowns faster though.  It's tough to build up you town
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evernote loaded on all of my devices. What an amazing way to keep every thought and reminder synced everywhere!
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|fun what else does a game really need to be but i would have liked it to be more challenging but a solid game none the less.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|ive been waiting in this game FOREVER and seeing it made my eyes light up. sadly its not free and my mama will not allow to buy gmes on here. NO EXCEPTIONS. so if it would have a free version on here I will GLADLY download it.but this game is still FANTABULOUS
140006922X|2.0|Wow it is more of an opinion than facts,wish I would have waited and brought it used. Waste of time
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|A combination of The Excorcist and a haunting movie and is the best horror/haunting movie since the Exorcist and The Omen.  The acting of the main characters and childeren were terrific and the viewer can easily develop a sense of sympathy for what the family endures on a nightly basis,  The scares were extrmely effective and appeared to be done with very limited special effects which was refreshing to see.  It is also telling that this was rated R film but there was virtually no fould language and very limited amount of blood.  It is possible this could have been Rated PG-13, but it was Rated R solely because of the scares.  That's very teling in itself.  Highly recommended
B00785P2QC|2.0|I loved virtural city, upgrade n plan at will. Not so with playground. Seems you upgrade on points or credits which accumulate very slowly. Can't do anything unless you have these or you can buy. This game is expensive two play. $10.00 to buy points, don't last long either. It is extremely annoying that they ask you to post on Facebook for every time you complete a goal. Shame on you g5!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its not what I had expected.  Im still trying to learn how to play games on my phone.  Please dont take it to heart.  I do still play it once in a while.  Thank you.  Shekata
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I have had this app follow me on a few devices, and thus far, the Kindle has been the best. Smooth play, great pool physics, an all around fun game! Highly recommended!
B007THA4FI|5.0|As many others have stated, this is not Harry Potter or the world that he lives in. This is a world much closer to reality and can be very painful to read at times. That said, I really enjoyed it. For me, all of the characters felt real in their own way, although at times they could border on caricature. Each of the characters (and there are many of them) saw the world in a slightly different way and responded to the world in a different way. Some of the characters you learn to despise, others you want to root for, and some you just have to wonder what made them the way they are.<br /><br />To me, the core of the story is about how one person can influence a community and the impact on that community when that person is no longer there. There is a struggle going on in Pagford between two opposing sides. When the defacto leader (Barry) of one of the sides suddenly dies, it causes a chain of events in people's lives. How it effects each person is different. The opposing side sees opportunity. The side with the lost leader struggles to find within themselves the ability to rise up and be the leader that Barry had been. Do they have the same passion that he had or were did they believe in Barry more than they believed in his causes? Then there are those people like Terri and Krystal that take no part in local politics but are deeply impacted by them. How will they deal with his loss?<br /><br />No one in this story is purely altruistic or free of sin. As your introduced to each character, you gather an opinion of each of them. No one is really likeable at first. As the story progresses, you learn some of the whys behind each of the characters and you see why many of them are the way they are. This is particularly true with the teenagers in the story, especially Krystal and Andrew. Some characters earned our sympathy while others earned our disdain.<br /><br />I think one element that made this book so great, was the British culture and language component. I cannot see these characters or this story in an American setting. It just wouldn't ring true. As an American, I really enjoy British stories, dialog and culture, thus making Casual Vacancy that much better for me.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to just anyone. If you're a person that doesn't sympathize with people in poverty, then there's a good chance that you won't like this story. I was always taught growing up to look at the world through the perspective of others to help me better understand why people do what they do. Casual Vacancy works for me for exactly that reason.
B00FQ272ZI|3.0|My husband & I were so looking forward to seeing this film, as survival/adventure stories have always interested us.  But this film fell flat on so many levels, we were really disappointed - to the point I can't help wondering if some of these &#34;glowing&#34; reviews are planted.  From the outset, the character does stupid things, in a lethargic and disinterested manner.  I won't go into each and every scene, but who stops to shave when their boat is sinking?  Who curls up to sleep on the one and only night they KNOW their boat will be in the shipping channel??  Also, we knew going in that there was said to be very little dialogue in this film - I had no problem with that concept.  But to have the character never so much as groan, talk in disgust under his breath, write in a journal, offer up a prayer, or any other normal human behavior, is taking &#34;art&#34; to a ridiculous point in my opinion.  Far from being on the edge of my seat, I found myself not at all caring about what became of this man.  There are several scenes where he does things and you can't even tell what it is he's supposed to be doing (this is where some journaling later could have helped immensely).  If this movie had been done better I could've easily sat through it for 3 or 4 hours.  As it was, I was glad it was under 2 hours and I have to say, the unusual ending was probably the best part.  We saw it in a theatre with only 2 other couples in attendance and based on the comments afterward, it was a split decision on how to interpret the ending.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It is a great game.There is no problems with the game.It takes a long time to download.But again it's awesome.It has a lot of cars.Some are expensive.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Like the game. Hate the stopping to rate the game every other level. Wish more time to levels. Want more time.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|I liked the book total cute, and makes you feel like your dog isn't the craziest thing alive after all
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is really quite easy...I chose 5 stars because there is no 10...there is not a bad episode so far.
B004DM1ZQY|1.0|It cheats and/or blocks your ability to make valid moves. I would have liked tips and guidelines before this review!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun and very addictive.  I wish this game were available for iPad and iPhone.  Need more games like this one.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|typical facebook app.  Wish I could play my games on it but I can not.  It is good if you want to update status or see your friends status
B00B5HQL50|4.0|One of the best Bond movies made...high intensity, action packed, excellent special effects, etc.  I think any guy would love this movie.
B004SYP5WC|3.0|I expected a little better app.  It is very simple. I can not select a period to check on bills paid. They just keep adding up. So when you check bills paid, it adds up all the previous bills paid. I have to scroll down to find the last one. also, it lists bills pd by the oldest first. Also, the date is kinda reversed - e.g. Nov. 15, 2013, is 15-11-13 (really confusing).  For the price, not a good deal. Looking for another.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|A very human Superman able to feel the pain of lost and pain of killing ..... Since Smallville they been toying with talking about the upbringing of Clark Kent by Jonathan and Martha where they help shape his ethical and human nature..... We saw a little bit of this in the Christopher Reeves Superman in 1978 but for some reason his acting was a bit stoic, in my opinion.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|Wow! I really wasn't expecting that. This is a remarkable book, superbly crafted and almost mesmeric in its language and description. The mastery with which it describes each event from the first-person standpoint of each character really builds the intensity of what is, underneath the hood, a tremendous thriller. I guarantee you will enjoy this story whether or not you're spiritually inclined (I'm not, really), because it's all so believable! Highly recommended, absolutely loved it!
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I liked the way portrayed him, as a man struggling with his identity.  The use if flashbacks was excellent. Of course I'm a fan if comic book charectors, but I do think it was well done. It had a great cast, effects, and it moved along well.  Not cartoon like with goofy humor like other movies (&#34;Green Lantern&#34;).  I am looking forward to the next one.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I always wondered what happened to Danny Torrance and this novel tied up all the loose ends nicely. It also fits nicely with King 's recurring themes of \\"Salem's Lot\\" and other novels. Maybe there will be more adventures with Abra going forward.
1847940323|1.0|transformative. Took a workshop with a foundation that used this book as the basis and wen to Amazon to buy. Read this
B00F2362IE|3.0|The game does take too long to load.  Other than that it is okay.  I think if you have the Kindle with the extra memory in it then it probably performs better.
1585104205|5.0|My 5 and 8 year olds use it as their textbook.  It introduces words and concepts that they can easily understand.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is by far the best superman movie ever made. I know that the bar has been pretty low, but I really enjoyed this movie. I really like the way it was shot. It does a little bit of going back and forth. It never felt stale or slow to me. Things were constantly happening.... the movie did not slow down much yet it found a way to show the self discovery stuff without making it boring.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Jaw dropping. Thrilling. Extremely moving and adventurous. I'm obsessed. Suzanne Collins is absolutely fantastic in the way she draws you into their world.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|WELL DONE. BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND SET.  OTHER GUEST PERFORMERS ADD TO THE VARITY OF THIS DVD INCLUDING THE FAMOUS AND FUNNY MUPPETS.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|It keeps you wanting to come back and level up. Not a bad game to spend your .<br />time on and play the daily challenges.
B0006N2EZ0|3.0|PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT TO A FAN.  HAVENT SEEN IT.  THE PERSON RECEIVING THE DVD LIKED IT.  SO THERE I STAND.
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVE THIS SERIES, love this book. Leaves you dying for more. Can be a little confusing at the end, but leaves you with an opening for the final book.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|THE PHANTOM, WHAT CAN ONE SAY?  BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, STAGE AND TALENT.  WELL DONE.<br />REALLY BEAUTIFULLY RECORDED AT ROYAL ALBERT HALL.  MAKES THE HALL SEEM EXPANSIVE AND LARGER THAN IT IS.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This is the best musical since the phantom of the opera!! I watched the movie right when i got it, fast shipping, neatly wrapped, and i am quite satisfied :D The music, the story, the characters...all awesome !
B00CUHMUZ4|5.0|ANDRE RIEU IS THE BEST AT WHAT HE DOES.  THE MUSIC IS REPEDITAVE IN EACH DVD BUT HE SOME HOW MAKES IT NEW EVERY TIME.  HOWEVER THIS ONE IS ALMOST TOO MUCH.  THE DUTCH LOVE THEIR ROYALS ESPECIALLY THE NEW YOUNG ONES.  ALL THE WHILE VENERATING THEIR FORMER QUEEN.  DUTCH DO NOT NEED MUCH OF A REASON TO PARTY.

B00BWQW73E|5.0|great read and excellent insight into this mega company! admire Bezos' tenacity, intellect, and foresight into the startup and growth of what has become an icon in retail sales.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are page turners!!!!!  I read all 3 in about a week!!!  I eventually bought my friend the books, so she could enjoy them.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a wonderful, beautiful, touching, funny, truthful book. I read this book on the recommendation of my 15-year-old niece and I thought it only fair to read it since I've recommended so many books to her. But I wasn't looking forward to that. I mean, I know the sorts of books teenage girls like. I don't like sparkles, let's just put it that way.<br /><br />Turns out I was wrong. This book sparkles with a truly human love and a touching sense of optimism. Considering its a book from the perspective of a 17-year-old girl with terminal cancer, that's a stunning accomplishment.<br /><br />This book took longer than normal for me to read, mostly because I could only read when I had time to cry and recover. Yet, with all the tears, I finished this book with a huge smile on my face.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row is another honest effort by John Grisham to deal with the complexity that we the South try desperately to believe no longer matters. It does matter.
B009ZG6YPU|4.0|Charlie Gordon works in a menial job at Donners bakery; he is thirty two years old, but has an IQ of 68.  He attends a centre for retarded adults, where he is taught by Alice Kinnian and, in his own words, has just “great motor-vation.”  This novel is written in a series of progress reports by Charlie, who is chosen for a scientific procedure to improve his intelligence.  Unable to understand the complexities of what is going on, Charlie is nevertheless desperate to improve, as he finds learning so difficult.  These self penned reports gradually improve in clarity and understanding, as Charlie’s IQ begins to rise.<br /><br />As Charlie’s intelligence begins to increase, he realises that he has misunderstood, and misinterpreted, the behaviour of other people and also begins to have upsetting flashbacks of his childhood. We follow his progress and treatment; alongside that of Algernon, a laboratory mouse, which has undergone similar treatment.  As Charlie becomes a genius he understand more than the scientists treating him and then Algernon starts behaving oddly...  This is a very moving novel, in which Charlie struggles to come to terms with his life, new emotions,  and changing intelligence.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Worst ending to a series ever! This book was an underwhelming finish. I thought the first two books were well written and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Sadly, the third did not live up to it's predecessors. Oh well, I guess I will just go read Harry Potter and The Hunger Games again:)
B00C9G22R2|3.0|A good combination of period drama, and martial arts, with few good-name actors. You will not find the hidden poetry of Crounching Tiger - Hidden Dragons, but, a good couple of hours of entertainment. Unusual ZiYi in her role
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|Outstanding job done on how Sully and Mike met. The scare tournament was fantastic, wished the movie was a little longer. Well done on getting Helen Mirren. Sully had the talent and Mike had the desire, plus they didn't get along when they first met.
B00EV6T6DQ|3.0|I enjoy the work.  The good part is the process of discovering and accepting one's sexual orientation.  As a same-sex love story, I think Brokeback Mountain has a stronger story (weird as it is to compare a graphic novel to a movie).  As a love story in general, I have read better graphic novels, for example Tokyo Love Story by Fumi Saimon.  In general, the characters could be developed more.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Two of my favorite actors. the plot was fantastic and it moved well. The guy with the pig was a scream! Plus you got Ernst Borgnine!<br />Noticed they managed to pull of the job without killing anyone.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|Overall, this is an excellent game that is well worth the price. However, there are a few critical drawbacks to be made aware of.<br />1. Small world size means less ore, making the game harder overall.<br />2. Lacking in features. A wide variety of the soundtrack is missing, and quite a few other features have been removed.<br />3. The game crashes whenever you put the kindle (first gen)  into sleep mode. It still remembers your progress, but it is still a nuisance nonetheless.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book was a bit hard to get into at first but then your are hooked.  Then you will be mad......lol.  Overall it it is a great book, I would recommend it highly.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|one of my favorites of all time.  this movie brings back memories and well as continuing to interest me as I watch it again and again

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love the game &amp; graphics but I didn't get the starter pack order I paid for. I either want my stuff or a refund!! Other than that it's fun and a good way to pass the time
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Great music, incredible show.  I listen quite often during work and to relax.  I exercise to this, walk, and work with this music
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is great fun, but seems impossible to update on time, and this is one that updates roughly every month. Amazon needs to really fix this issue, but at least it isnt with the game.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|one of my favorites of all time.  this movie brings back memories and well as continuing to tickle me as I watch it again and again
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|Good game but always restarted so I couldn't keep upgrading. Gave a virus to my friend's Kindle and almost had to restart her whole thing. Not worth it.

0316055433|1.0|pretentious, endless, long-winded conversations,  about the importance of art.in this miserable life.  . And I personally am very interested in art - read most of the first chapter, dipped in  to the rest then  back to the library. Why say something in 10 words when you can use 200.  No wonder it's 771 pages long. lAnd badly written.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Each level requires a new strategy to complete, but it is not impossible to figure out. I would recommend this game.
0345535561|4.0|George R. R. Martin crafted a bone-chilling, high fantasy story; I'm angry with myself for hopping on the bandwagon so late.<br />To pretty much give you the general idea about what these books are about:<br /><br />&#34;'Always keep your foes confused. If they are never certain who you are or what you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose, or even seem to work against you. Remember that when you come to play the game.'<br />'What...what game?'<br />'The only game. The game of thrones.'&#34;<br /><br />The books — at times — are not a nice read: there’s rape, incest, prostitution, slavery and gore in here. Yes, not a very nice series… but it’s realistic in a way like the middle ages. A Song of Ice and Fire has that atmosphere.<br /><br />There are also daring knights with shinning amour and swords and hilarious banters; there are winters too cold and wars too heart-wrenching.  The books may be terribly long and sometimes a slow read, but they're really fun as well as adventurous ones. Fantasy is the best genre to read to get lost in another world entirely different from our own — especially the long fantasies since one could savour it a little more… A Song of Ice and Fire is one of those long fantasies people should read.
B002BWP49C|4.0|It was fun to watch. I've been waiting to see this movie for a while now. It was so worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Annoyingly addictive but so  much fun!!! Just when you think you can't finish a board and you want to pull your hair out, BAM, you got it!!
B000002AQQ|3.0|always wanted to get this cd, finally did. I thought it would have better songs on it. Guess my memory of the movie had more songs. Not too impressed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|While I loved the other two books in the series, I was so disappointed in the ending! The change in narrator style foreshadowed this, but didn't make it any better.
159463176X|5.0|Again, Mr. Hosseini does a fantasic job telling a story. I will admit it was  not as good as the kite runner or 1,000 splendid sons. too bad
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Excellent game,  hours of fun. Not hindered too badly by the freemium format, top tier equipment accessible without paying real money if so desired. High replay value.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was excellent and well written. Jam packed with adventure. One of the best books I have ever read.  Rick Riordan did it again with the Heroes of Olympus series.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|First of all this is a very well done game.  It truly deserves 5 stars.  There are a few glitches that kept me from giving it all the stars it deserved.  The puzzles were well thought out but a few were very frustrating to solve.  The skip button was so close to the puzzle area that it was easy to accidentally touch it and spoil the solution effort.  Bated that.  Everything else was well done.  Loved graphics storyline and voiceovers.  Will by sequel.
B0096PAA6E|2.0|Most of the songs sound like Michael Frickin Jackson<br />Only three good BLUES songs - the rest suck.<br />Clapton gave him all the exposer - now live up to it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great character development, and it gives a good depiction of ongoing life in a horrible world without any hope of getting better at any time soon.  It makes one pause to think if just surviving is reason enough to go on living.
B001P3SA94|5.0|Beyoncé is HOT<br />History of blues is told in fiction that is almost believable.<br />Actor do a fantastic job portraying the Chicago legends.
B00BIR381W|1.0|The very first CD wouldnt even play the package came brand new still in plastic wrap and doesnt even work.... VERY DISAPPOINTED
B00C4YZ12C|2.0|This is a awesome game needs the latest update 2.9.6 the update adds support for the moga controller and Google+ sign in and game features achievements and leaderboards
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Wonderful -- Gaiman at his best. You will not regret reading this. Or, possibly you will if you read the gory parts after sunset.<br /><br />So read this in full daylight. You won't regret it.
B00FLDG52I|5.0|Ordered 11/19 & received 11/21.<br />Played both DVD discs & they had none of the problems mentioned in other reviews.(White lines across screen, poor audio)<br />There were some out of focus moments as the cameramen locked into a close-up, but given the material came from 2 live concerts filmed indoors, I didn't expect it to be perfect.<br /><br />A lot of  energy, and enjoyment permeates the DVD's & the guitar playing is outstanding. It has the feel of an event at which the musicians had a hell of a good time.<br /><br />Favorites include  \\"The Needle and The Damage Done\\", (Allmans, Haynes & Trucks),  & \\"Don't Let me Down' (John Mayer & Keith Urban), but for me the standout was Gary Clarke Jr. His falsetto & clean playing on \\"Please Come Home\\" was something else.<br />And he showed his versatility with a grinding version of \\"When My Train Pulls In\\". Flashes of Hendrix in there<br />If your into blues or Clapton and the opportunity to see many top guitarists having a blast together, then I can recommend this DVD without hesitation.<br />The fact that it has about 15 more tracks than the CD is worth the purchase alone. & they are good tracks, not fillers.<br />I was remiss in not mentioning Eric earlier. He looked contented, I thought his voice was better than 2010 and his playing is still as 'fluid' as ever, to quote one of the Allman brothers.
B00340ESIS|5.0|I couldn't believe I'd like a book about writing formula film scripts. Didn't I just finish Lynda Obst's &#34;Sleepless in Hollywood&#34;??<br /><br />Nonetheless, I couldn't stop reading Snyder's how-to manual on how to write a blockbuster script. I'll never write a screenplay in my life, but I now understand a little more about how postmodern flicks work. And so will you.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Loved this it brings me right back to the feelings I had watching the play on Broadway.  Would recommend this to anyone who<br />saw the play and even those who didn't.
B006QNDDHW|5.0|Few of us can spend the 70-90 hours in preparing a one-hour presentation that is the assumption in Duarte's book. Nonetheless, slide:ology delivers on its premise: you can understand and think about the design of presentations that are unique, artful, charming, and persuasive.
B00H83EUL2|4.0|&#60;No spoilers&#62;<br /><br />3D tickets at the theaters aren't cheap these days but Gravity is definitely worth seeing.  For many movies, the whole 3-D part is something of a gimmick, but not so much in this one.  Yes, there are a few of those stock film shots when something flies by your head, but in general, you find yourself forgetting the fact its 3-D as you get absorbed in the story.  And the story is absorbing.<br /><br />You shouldn't expect a large cast on this one.  In fact, it's a tiny cast.  The vast majority of the story (no spoilers) takes place in space.  But unlike Apollo 13 and other space movies, there is no real development of mission control.  Instead you get what's essentially a real time story about a horrific accident in space and the efforts of the crew to survive.<br /><br />George Clooney plays a great role.  He's a career astronaut and an experienced hand.  On the surface he's a bit of a clown. Underneath he's all business. Using a mix of jokes and distractions, he tries to maintain the calm among the crew while desperately struggling to get control of the situation.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is the scientist in the crew.  She doesn't seem to be too thrilled about being in space but she's there to do an important job, and so she tolerates it.  If you've seen Sandra in other movies, expect something a little different this time.  Yes, she still has a bit of the quirky nature you'd expect but this is not fun and games.  It's a survival role, and unlike Clooney, she's not clowning around.<br /><br />This is very much a character driven story.  However, the plotline is pretty riveting too if you don't get hung up on technical details.  This isn't a documentary, so don't expect perfection.  The cinematography is something of a mixed bag.  At times it's fantastic--as good as any I've seen.  At other times they seem to lose the grip, and it can look a big contrived and cartoonish.<br /><br />The bottom line?  So long as you don't hung up on the technical flaws, I think you'll be entertained by fresh story that isn't formulaic.  And if you let go a bit, you'll lose yourself in a space adventure that gives you a birdeye view from space.  I'm confident that most who make the trip will be glad they saw this one in the theaters.  It's that good.  Maybe not quite five stars -- but for me, it's definitely the best movie I've seen this year.
1557427968|3.0|A harder read than I was expecting, I ended up skipping chapters seeing as they were talking about Jewelry and tapestry. This book could be compressed down into a short story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this is probably the most addicting game I have come across... and I have played many... why else would you be here...
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I'm not sure how most fans feel about it, but \\"Presto\\" might be one of the more underrated Rush albums in their entire catalog imo and I would go so far as to say it's better than \\"Power Windows\\" and \\"Hold Your Fire,\\" which is not to put those fine albums down, that's just how strongly I feel about \\"Presto\\".<br /><br />Standout tracks for me are \\"War Paint\\" and my personal favorite \\"Red Tide\\", two of the more obscure tracks in the Rush catalog & 2 tracks that I would love to see the band add to their live set. I don't believe \\"War Paint\\" has been done live since the early 90s and \\"Red Tide\\" if I'm correct has never been performed. How I would love to see Rush give it a try however.<br /><br />And speaking of live performance, it wasn't until I saw the \\"Time Machine Tour\\" that I realized what a great song the title track \\"Presto\\" is. I certainly gained a new appreciation for it & it might be my other favorite song from this LP.<br /><br />The 80s for me are definitely the high point for Rush albums & \\"Presto\\" closes out the decade very strongly. 5 stars
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Do not get.WORST GAME EVER! I have the game and it is horrible.I seriously don`t know why but it sucks!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like eggs and cookies Bobby Joe Lieberman's first time to time for the sunrise thro the first to be able the toe Yuri and the sunrise thro the toe nail in this case is magic Job
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Love the game but it constantly crashes here lately. Haven't gotten any scratch cards in along while. Tried redownloading and I had to start all over.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I love these hidden object puzzle games.  They teach you too sharpen your wit.  Very entertaining and has not been frustrating at all.  I recommend this game to anyone who loves an adventure.
1476727651|5.0|A truly fun and literary depiction of redemption and recovery. Danny Torrence's rise from the ghosts of his past and alcoholism to becoming a true hero in the face of some pernicious and wicked evil is inspiring and riveting. Once again, I walked away from a King book with the feeling that I had made some friends, the characters being so life-like and likeable. At first I was put off of the &#34;humaness&#34; of the RV driving villians, but in the end they were the perfect foil for Danny and his entourage of helpers that must stop the very thing that breaks and darkens all of our hearts: the appearance of the faces of innocence on bulletin boards and on the side of milk cartons. Sometimes raw and always full of wonder and grace, Doctor Sleep broadens a masters mythos with broad and honest strokes. Just wait a long time for that final sleep, Mr. King, and continue to give us tales like this one.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was the talk of the town, so I had to read it.  But it was just OK, a little repetitive on the sex scenes - It is a good love story.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I love these movies.... I can see these over and over without ever getting bored. If you've never seen them or are a fan, just get them.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Easy reading and very funny.  A simple way to start getting rid of all the clutter.  I could never get rid of everything, like the author did, but maybe I can get close.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I LOVE IT. IT IS AN AMAZING GAME WITH WONDERFUL EFFECTS. I JUST WISH I COULD MOVE ABOUT A LITTLE FASTER BUT OTHERS THAN THAT IT IS A GREAT GAME. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
B0030MTQNW|5.0|this is one of the best WWII movies ever made. and a true story too boot. every star in the world is in it.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Man Of Steel-Producer and Writers Had No Idea of What Comprised The Superman Canon!!<br /><br />When I started watching this movie it quickly became apparent to me that this movie was going to morph into a CGI extravaganza of explosion and destruction and having very little to do with the legend of Superman.  First off in no previous Superman incarnations was Jor-El killed by General Zod.  The destruction of Krypton has always been just the jumping off point to explain how Superman came to Earth and gained his powers.  This movie was very hard to follow because it seemed to be nothing but CGI explosions and destruction  occasionally broken up by vignettes of dialogue.  The first time we view The Man of &#34;Hope&#34;, we see that the producer/writers have violated one of the most basic canons of Superman.  His beard and nails do not grow under a yellow sun.  I got the feeling that prior to beginning this movie the producer/writers maybe looked at a few Superman comic books, maybe a Christopher Reeve Superman movie and maybe one or two episodes of Smallville and Lois and Clark.  They had just enough information to make the audience think that they(the producer/writers) knew what Superman was about.  In the movie, Clark Kent revealed his powers to Pete Ross and Lana &#60;ang as well as any other kids on the bus who were paying attention.  In the canon, Pete Ross discovered Clark was Superboy during a camping trip and Lana, while she had her suspicions never really did.  Skip to the present.  Superman reveals himself right away to Lois Lane.  In the canon, never happened that way.  Superman loses his powers when he goes on board a Kryptonian vessel!  C'mon, they state in the movie that Superman gets his powers from our sun.  So how could he lose them on a Kryptonian ship that is on Earth.  This movie just SUCKS!!  The producer and writers owe a big apology to the families of Superman creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.  And shame on DC comics for letting this clownof a producer try to change the legend of an iconic character such as Superman!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Great take on a super hero book that instead has those with powers rule as tyrants and the struggles that come with it. Very well thought out story, added enough details as you went along to paint a broad picture of the environment but also let you fill it in yourself  a bit.
B00FAI2IUM|1.0|Graphics don't match the pictures. And the animation are horrible. Dont play this game. Why do you guys always do this
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Was hoping you would add this for kindled soon.glad to play it on bigger screen! Wish XP did not take so long and some things you need to feed blurb were not so time consuming
B0063GORYU|5.0|the best solitare program anywhere, I would strongly recommend this for anyone that enjoys Solitare. So get this app now! :)
B007MB5OCE|3.0|well my friend LOVED it. I think my problem with this book is that my husband has alzheimer's so somehow a lot of the humor was to real to be funny.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|My whole family loves this movie, you really want to believe it's real. Get uour popcorn and coke ready beforehand. LOL Bought it for a christmas gift,
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|great story & hard to put down  amazing  journey that is a testament to the human spirit  .  rarely does a book bring me to real tears.  so good.  much much better then the movie.
B00D0Z2JR4|5.0|this item is awsome got it from amazon for only 20 dollars so i was really happy. The movie itself is great spoiler alert the funniest scene is seeing vegeta singing and dancing like a captain ginyu priceless
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wild ride.  Well written.  Loved the story line.  I have always liked the way Grisham pulls everything together, and by the end you have everything explained and tied up in a bow.  Keeps a good pace.  His characters are outrageous!.  His insights into Southern culture is great.  Its a whole different world in the South.  I am sure much has changed since the 80's, but then again.... not a lot.  Enjoyed it from start to finish.
B00594XOZU|1.0|My mom is UN available on my kindle so now I can't text them at all and so I had to get a new texting app
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Fun cheesy movie.  Don't watch it thinking it to be anything else and you will be fine.  If you expect it to be anything more you will be disappointed.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Thor really rocks. Epic adventure in Marvel land. Casting of Loki was perfect...you want to hurt that guy yourself. Natalie Portman..do I need to say anymore?
B00G32QIEG|5.0|Fun movie!  Don't watch it thinking everything in the story line is cohesive and you will be just fine.  Have fun with it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|GREAT!!<br />I am looking forward to book four.  Have enjoyed reading it. Would like to know when it comes out let me know
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|She combines her sharp humor with honesty and astute personal introspection. We are lucky to be privy to her world
0316044695|5.0|I am very happy with the book, it arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I will continue to order books as I need or want them here. The prices are very good, and not having to leave the house to buy things like this is a great thing for me, since I do not have a car.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book could not put it down. Very easy to read and follow. Ana is a great character, even if things are complicated.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game I like it better on my tablet than on Facebook. I would recommend this game to everyone that plays this type of role playing game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I did not know a few things that surprised me.  I am sure if I had read a little more I would not have been surprised.<br /><br />* The device plugs into an HDMI on the T.V. not your computer.<br />* The device must be powered by a wall socket or USB on the T.V.  So it comes with a cord and plug in.<br />* The device will allow any computer, phone, tablet etc in range to cast anything in a Chrome web browser to the web not just videos.<br /><br />Everyone that sees it ask the same thing...  &#34;How do you do that?&#34;<br />Pictures scrolled through on the T.V.,  Facebook stalking for the room to enjoy, etc...<br />G+ hangout (video chat) looks like a futuristic movie.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|I think Pendergast is one of the most interesting characters in the genre, and I have read each and every one of the Pendergast books.  While I really liked this one, and read it in one sitting, I didn't quite love it.  I did love the fact that we get to see a more emotional side of Pendergast, and the images of him dealing with a snowy Rocky Mountain winter in his typical sartorial splendor were just delicious.  And of course, his vast knowledge of investigative techniques and just about everything else, along with his ability to quickly size up a situation, was as impressive as ever. That said, the reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because I was truly frustrated by all the incredibly stupid actions of Pendergast's protege, Corrie.  Pendergast has come to her rescue on multiple occasions in the past, and yet, having seen that he is never an alarmist and  usually correct,  she  disregards his warnings and proceeds on a fool's errand, all the while thinking that somehow, Agent Pendergast is going to steal the credit for the paper she's working on.  Even while dealing with Corrie's questionable actions, however, the authors managed to write breathtakingly frightening scenes, and descriptions of places that were so real you felt you were moving through them with the characters, right down to feeling the cold winter air. All in all, another great addition to the Pendergast saga.
B009NF54ZE|1.0|Read only access to phone state is completely different than read phone status AND IDENTITY! These devs need to be honest and accurate about what permissions they're requesting of the end user, else I have no trust of their real intentions. This app is too invasive: zero stars
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Of all the to do list management tools I have tried Wunderlist out shines them all. The Wunderlist Kindel app is well done and provides a consistent interface between multiple platforms.
B00A4A1KK0|5.0|Phillip Phillips is made of talent.  American Idol started with Kelly C. and had James Durbin in the middle, and ended with Phillip Phillips.  There will NEVER be another A.I. like Phillip Phillips.  Never.  All of the songs on this cd are good.  Usually when I buy a cd there is one song I do not like, Just one.  but not on this cd.  This one is the best and I am glad I own it.  he will be around the music scene for DECADES and go down in history as a legend.  Why not buy his first cd?  Ya nutz?  ;)
B000ICM5O4|5.0|Rocky was one of the best films about Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. If you don't know the story, its about A brain injured boxer and loan collector for the loan shark, Rocky Balboa, who has a crush on painfully shy Adrienne, his friend Burt's sister who works at the pet shop. Rocky played beautifully by Sylvester Stallone in his finest performance ever. Talia Shire is unrecognizable as Adrienne. You can't help but root for this unlikely couple.<br /><br />Supporting cast includes Burt Young and Burgess Meredith who both did fabulous work in their roles.<br /><br />If you love the movie or the city of philadelphia, you will love Bill Contis original soundtrack of the film. By the end, win or lose, you can't help but root for Rocky and Adrienne, one of cinema's great screen couples.<br /><br />Too bad, Bill Conti should have won the Academy Award for creating the sound, feeling, and essence of the great American city in a cinema blockbuster. This cd reminds me of all that!
B0033VUH6A|5.0|It deserved the academy award for a great performance! The stars in this one hit the mark for some great scenes.
0307352153|5.0|A rare and insightful exploration of culture. A wonderful mix of America's history, rapid and catchy development toward business and what it takes to sell, all embodied within the historically and still important gift that 'thinkers' offer to our society. As an introvert I found this book validating, encouraging and very well written with a perfect blend of history and psychology.
B000KFB4PK|4.0|My 5 year old loves this watch. He still can't tell time but is really involved and loves to try to figure it out.
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|Bias - Love Joss Whedon and Amy Acker<br />I just want to be honest....  Since I'm such a fan, I am probably not very objective.  Plus, who doesn't want to see Wesley and Fred together again?
0062107313|5.0|My wife loves to read and that book was her choice. She loves it and she is recommending it to these people that like to read.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bill Bryson is just a great story teller, even if only Americans understand such a wierd and boring game as baseball.
1439156816|5.0|I really enjoyed this book . . .a lot. I enjoyed learning about Mr. King's early years in the first section. The middle section was of great help to me as a new author. The last section about his accident and then getting back to writing was touching. I found the entire book very interesting and Mr. King can be quite funny. I laughed out loud more than a few times. Every section was full of humor.  I found Stephen King very likable and I loved how he spoke of his wife. He obviously loves and adores her. If you are a writer, you can learn a lot from Mr. King. If you are not a writer but enjoy reading Stephen King's books, you would enjoy getting to know the man.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Of course nearly everyone knows about this game by now, if they ever stepped fingers onto Facebook.  Finally it has made it's way to the Kindle Fire HD.  I have no complaints and am duly hooked.  It's much easier to negotiate on the Kindle than on the computer.  Very worth the measly little price charged!
020530902X|5.0|At this moment, I have not quite completed reading this book straight though cover to cover, but it is full of very pertinent information for anyone who is writing. It is full of the answers to so many things you need to know when writing and a great reference book to help remind you how to use certain words and punctuation correctly.  I am keeping it by my side as I write and referring to it while still reading cover to cover. It is a must for any serious writer.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This is like Tetris all grown up and electrified.  I totally love it and was hooked until the next addiction became a freebie!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I wanted to like this book. I really did, but it felt like Roth had no direction. The ending made no sense, not because of what she did to the main character, but the main characters motivation for it.<br />I could pick this book apart but I'd rather just say, if you are a fan of the series; finish it out, give it a chance. Then after you read it you can decide for yourself if you think the book was horrible. I did
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|So far-so good.  I am hooked!  The pictures become a bit boring after a while, but the puzzles are fun and can be a bit annoyingly challenging.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I didn't hate this book, but I honestly don't understand why so many people love it. I found there to be very little character development for most of the characters, Ender himself is a completely unbelievable character, and honestly, most of the book was incredibly boring.<br />Now, that's not to say that there was nothing good in this book, I actually liked certain aspects and ideas that Card came up with. I just honestly don't understand why everyone goes crazy for this book.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is strategy based, so if you are more of a low IQ person, than this is not for you. But then again, this a game where you pop balloons using monkeys, so how hard could it be? Anyway, in this game you can earn &#34;Monkey Money&#34; which helps you with upgrades and buying &#34;Special Agents&#34;. You can also earn tokens to buy permanent upgrades that affect how strong your towers are, or how fast they pop bloons, and how much money and lives you start out with in the beginning of any game. Those are just two things that are different and better than the original BTD's, not to mention the crisp, clean, and amazing graphics.  If you have played Bloons Tower Defense before but still have no idea what I'm talking about, your only choice now is to get this game. Oh yeah, did I mention that Bloons Tower Defense 5 comes with more maps, more challenges, a special Odyssey mission, and a couple of new awesome  towers? If you're still not convinced about getting this game, well, then I guess that means that your just not awesome like all the other people getting this game.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a really fun and challenging game. You can hunt deer along with wolves, bears, wolverines, bighorn, and many other animals. It's really great for 2014!!!!!!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Finally, Castleville for my Kindle! I love playing it on Zynga.com. The Kindle version is different but it's still addictive and fun!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I really liked this book.  Had read The Shining many years ago so was curious to see how Danny Torrance had grown up.  The book is engrossing as are all King's novels, but a little disappointing in that there's very little connection to its predecessor.  Still, it's a book I didn't want to put down, like most of his.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|LOVED  it  . I was happy  the  author  did not  drown  me in biblical scriptures<br />The  book  was easy  to follow  it also  helped me understand what I  really need  instead of  always getting  what  I  want<br />It helped  me understand  why some of my  situations didnt  work out  we  were feeding the  problems  the  wrong  damn  solutions
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I love having this on my Kindle so that I can browse through it any time I want.  Thank you Brandon for what you do!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|good straightup action especially slow mo scenes, expletives are unnecessary to make good movie little in the way of  character building but maybe that's the prequel
B0015DWJ8W|1.0|I usually see one-star reviews and assume the reviewer has a bone to pick with the author.  I do not know Haruki so that is not the case with this review. I do know I have read a large variety of running books.  Some are great, most are mediocre and a few are bad.  This one is atrocious. I am baffled when people like it as while I know people vary in tastes, I cannot see how someone would like this stilted style of writing about rather unimpressed feats stretched over the course of uninspiring memoirs.  This is one of the few books I almost could not even finish as it was not only not adding anything to my life but seemingly taking away from it.<br />I honestly don't even want to think about this book anymore and have to end the review here.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I haven't played one of these for a long time. I've always enjoyed them! Great to see one again. Thanks Nevosoft!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I found that this book abounds in historical information derived from all aspects if early 20th century life.  Once you begin, you have to finish the trilogy!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|FAKE!!! FAKE!!! NOT LIFEPROOF!!! FORGERY!!! Bought this and saw that it didn't fit the phone right. The color is also lighter than the picture. Called Lifeproof and was informed that these cases are in fact...a forgery.
0345535529|5.0|I have gone through books 1-4 and am really excited in owning the box set. I can't wait to read onto the 5th book and I am simply thrilled to have the current collection in my possession.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|fun to play but hard to get through if you don't want to pay money, and I won't pay to pop bubbles
B003G4W49C|5.0|Goodly I think like it was awesome very awesome I think. You should seriously read it!! Very good I think, very good
B000JML7EC|4.0|Excellent book<br />Readers especially young or old who yearn for an adventure at sea<br />And  able to use their imagination.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it is fun and entertianing especially for my cousin<br />Love it and I get to play it after school and my teacher even like it is is awesome
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My highest recommendation.<br />Excellent entertainment with an interesting dose of history.  Cinematography was gorgeous.  Acting was superb.  Altogether engaging.  I looked forward to it every night with Prime and wait eagerly for series 4..
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I laughed uproariously through the first 2/3rds, smiled and cried the rest. Sentimental, raunchy and real, with a lovely ending to boot.
B00EDUTGB2|5.0|Works every time. I can print documents from my kindle anywhere in the house. it works well with document type software.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|AMAZING!!!!! These 3 books are awesome and everyone should read them! :)  :p :D <3 Suzanne Collins is a genius!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|This is one of the loudest movies I have ever watched. The battle scenes are so relentless that it really gets tedious. I had to pause  it a few times to give my ears a rest. No Clark Kent in this one except at the very end. And no personality either - no humor, no heart and no soul. Just constant special effects. If you like that sort of thing then go for it. I grew up watching the TV show. That was far superior to this movie in terms of character development.<br /><br />Independence Day is copied in parts and Sears has a very prominent placement.<br /><br />It is about 15 minutes too long and Lois Lane needed to be played by someone else. Perry White never wore an ear ring.<br /><br />I guess the sequel is about developing the Clark Kent character.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A brilliantly beautiful and painful novel of young love and loss acquired far too soon.  I couldn't put it down.
086571701X|4.0|Well written, comprehensive, easy to follow and understand. This takes going green to a new level. Written by someone that has practical experience.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|If you're looking for a game to kill time when you've got 10-15 extra minutes, this game is perfect.  Graphics are good and my kids love to play this version.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Recommend to anyone that loves to get lost in a good book!! It was so sad when it ended you wish it would keep going!!
B00371XIJE|1.0|If you want to cry, this film will do it.  However, I absolutely hated that Hachi was allowed to run the streets loose even when Parker was alive.  I live in a very small town, but sooner or later the dog would be hit by a car or picked up by animal control.  Then Parker's daughter lets Hachi decide for himself.  Come on, folks, he is a dog.  How can she justify turning him loose to fend for himself?  Also, although loyal and devoted, I'd hardly call Hachi a hero.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|This was just a stupid movie for the regular reasons horror flicks suck...cheap thrills (all boo scares), overdone effects on the &#34;monster&#34;...just bleh...terrible example of an overproduced, underwhelming, overhyped pile of crap.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Decent.<br />Takes a while for energy to restore but it's a fun game. Has its flaws but you get what you pay for lol
B00G32OER4|5.0|I am rarely so impressed or so unimpressed with something that I feel compelled to leave a review. This is one of those rare moments. Oh. My. God....this movie was awesome. I love horror flicks, but they're just NEVER actually scary. This one is the exception...and in my opinion, the ONLY exception I have seen in a really really long time. The movie didn't rely on &#34;boo&#34; moments to get screams, although there were plenty of them...it was pretty scary from the first minute and just kept the creepy at max capacity all the way until the ending (which I also loved). All in, this was just great! That's all.
0143124544|5.0|It was creative, characters were engaging, well written, heart-breaking. I could not put it down!  And yes, there were real tears shed.
B008B68IUY|5.0|fine just what I needed! merry Christmas hope you are happy now this is a gift I could not find in stores
B004QK5N5W|3.0|This adapter works well, but the cord is too short and pretty stiff. When you plug another cable into it, it puts a lot of strain and leverage on the iPad port. I fear excessive use could damage the port.
B00BC254I8|5.0|I'm a boxing fan and a Mike Tyson fan so I may be a little biased, but I really enjoyed this autobiography. Mike tells it like it is and you come away from the book understanding how and why he has lived the life he has. I was most surprised by the stories of Cus (his mentor and trainer) and how he was a hard-nosed jerk at times in the process of carving a young mike Tyson into a vicious animal inside and out of the ring. There are a number of fascinating tales in the book too, from the way in which he managed to sleep with female fans during his time in prison to the chronicling of his heavy-weight career as a coked up addict in the later stages. A great read!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter was the best and most original TV series with an outstanding cast! This DVD series is a must own collection!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I simply loved the romance between Ana and Christian. My friends said that this book was boring however I found the storyline very entertaining. Be sure to read all three in sequence.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Very similar to first pirate game but they move the dialog along faster, thank goodness. Objects are sometimes difficult to see but over all very nice. Story is tiresome.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|very poor storyline and no ackting skills. Everything was done by computer generated animation and I have seen cartoons done better. Everything happened so fast so it didn't give youo time to see how cheaply it was done it was a blur! Worst movie I have had the displeasure of sitting through!
B00382S9SC|4.0|Same great show from HBO, but this time around the packaging is much better than the older, bulkier DVD sets.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love the program and will continue to watch. I gave it a four  only because after so much sadness already, another sad ending to the season. How about some happy endings.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Sometimes a bit wordy but gripping for over seven hundred pages.  You care about these characters addiction not withstanding.  Thanks Donna Tartt
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I have read only one Grisham book which I thought was as good as Sycamore Row. Usuakky I get bored with all the &#34;legaleez&#34; but this one holds my interest very well as a lot of that is missing and just an interesting story.
B00C1040TO|1.0|Did not work with my Android Trio Pro tablet.<br />So I  deleted it.  What more is there to write, it seemed to be a great, useful app from the description.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved every minute of this book. Being a wife and mother of &#34;Don&#34; I laughed out loud on almost every page.
B000NY12LO|4.0|This was a really great book! The beginning and end were exciting an extremely realistic, but the middle of the book seemed to drag on. I recommend this book highly, but not if you're looking for a quick read.
B004DCB62M|5.0|Enjoyed the Holmes stories since childhood and see something new each time I return. Always more appreciation for the long-suffering and self-effacing Watson. It's clear, though, that as time want on, Doyle had less and less patience with his most popular character. Later stories feel &#34;phoned in&#34; compared to the intricate schemes of the earlier Holmes stories.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I have a pretty thorough collection including a lot of the real crap, poor quality and uninteresting recordings. While nothing will compete with Jimi's complete albums, this was a real treat to find. Good sound quality, some alternate takes of songs I know and some uniquely new and fun stuff I've never heard.<br /><br />This guy was just beginning to achieve his potential when he died.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|I got it for Christmas gift for my little girl!!She is going to be so excited to open it up!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Makes going through files a breeze.  A must have for the kindle.  I love my kindle, but I would not love it as much without this app
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|It was everything my little girl wanted couldn't find it at the store!! She is gonna be one happy little girl!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is amazing.  Not only for gaming, but for 3d art, programming, etc.  This mouse is my standard, I cannot go back to regular mice anymore.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Wonderful Movie!  A must see for everyone....  Enjoyed Morgan Freeman as usual.  Great story and I found it uplifting and encouraging.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This shows my age, but i bought &#34;soldiers under command&#34; on album, a white album. I've been a fan ever since but had not bought any new stuff since &#34;against the law&#34;. When i read all the reviews i just had to try this and i'm not kidding, this is the best cd i've bought in years. Its stryper's best ever. No filler's , heck even the ballad is good (can't believe i said that). Its heavy through and through. Thanks guys for putting this out and hope it sells a million.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thought this was a great follow up to The Shining.  It was nice to revisit the original character cast.  Didn't we all wonder whatever happened to Danny Torrance and Dick Halloran!  Definitely kept me enthralled until the conclusion.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Definitely unsettling, but profoundly close to many of the technologies and services that we use today in 2013. I believe we have enough societal awareness to prevent some of this from happening, but much of what the book says about transparency is true, and even positive. Really resonated with me, highly recommended, especially for anyone working in technology, education, or generally with an interest in social media and it's future.
0345479092|4.0|Many good thoughts!  She has a good understanding of children.  Written from a secular point of view.  We use in combination with To train up a child and Baby Wise books.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Was a funny and overall great movie. My 2 year old grandson sat and didn't move threw the whole movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game you can run grab coins.<br />You can complete missions.<br />you can even unlock other people.<br />Its awesome.<br />rating 100%
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Really fun for a quick time killer game. We take it to coffee shops or restaurants and play while we wait for our food.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love it,gives an old man back his skills.Will need them in the next couple of years when my wife retires.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game there is never a dull moment.<br /> I can play this game day and night.  Once I make it to the end then I can start all over.  It's like starting a new game each time
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Everything is as expected. Great quality, reasonable price. Would recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game.  Love to play this one. Great graphics and cool levels.  It is a great game for all ages including us young at hearts!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a super fun game! It's easy then gets harder and harder as you go on. I definitely recommend this game for everyone. But a problem I had with it is the deaths are all the same. They always land the same way :( . But nevertheless it's a beautifully designed and created game. I love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is so relaxing  and I look forward to playing it daily.  Thank you for making Candy Crush available to Kindle.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is awesome and you can create your own houses and its so creative and my brother loves it and so does my dad :-) my name's Alexander ramos<br />.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Cleverly written for the perspective of a scientist with Asperger's.  Think &#34;Sheldon Cooper&#34; meets, and despite himself falls in love with, well, someone smart, unpredictable and a little out there.  Someone who has never formed a real attachment to anyone suddenly begins to understand the meaning of love.  That's the beauty of the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much. It rises above subway surfer and jetpack joyride . The minions running are so cute. It even has the settings  from theories and I lobe that . That is why I give this game a five-star rating .
B00EPFEY44|2.0|This was a very disappointing purchase.  We still have the Love in Portofino concert on our DVR and we thought by ordering the CD/DVD we would get to see even more, as is usually the case.  Instead, we got only a few songs on the CD (similar to his concert Vivere, Live in Tuscany) and a subset of the PBS concert selections.  We should have saved our money and kept watching the recorded version.  Luckily, I decided not to delete it until we'd watched the DVD....
B004VWH3KI|4.0|The book itself was in good condition  but there was some pen marks on the front cover that makes the book cover art look unattractive. Other than that the delivery was prompt and the book itself is readable. A good buy!!!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|very helpful and informative. From a formatting standpoint it was not the best but it served the purpose of step by step showing how to simply create format upload and publish a kindle ebook.
6305428042|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite Hallloween movies. I bought it to share with my students in middle school. They loved it
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I got this game for my kindle thinking that I would be able to access this game in my facebook account but it will not let me access it. I have to start at level one and work my way back up if I want to play on my kindle fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Bible is within my hand wherever I go instead of carrying a heavy book and so easy to read the part or chapter or verse you want
0307887898|5.0|Great information and tactics on how to start your business effectively.  The direction of your startup is up to you, however this book provides insight as to how you can manage growing pains.  Highly recommended!
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Very entertaining and funny. I just love British humor!<br />Simon Pegg was great, as usual. Would definitely recommend this film.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The whole series US riveting and exciting.  Keeps you intrigued and wondering what will happen next.  I loved it and have read the series more then once.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this app whenever I travel and need to block out unfamiliar noises. Nice clock feature. Also very nice to listen to sounds with ear buds when I am reading, or if someone is snoring!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is awesome ad free cool good variety of guns and is easy so it's really a great game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game a lot lot lot lot there so cute<br />and the graphics are cool its addicting I play it all the time esp. in the bathroom
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|When I first got the game I thought it would suck but it is really good and I prefer it to anyone who likes video games
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Storyline is predictable.  Bodies were fun to look at.  I love Natalie.. and well.. more adventure to come for all of us to eat popcorn by.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I have always enjoyed James Bond. I think the reason is mainly, because those stories are so far out, that they really become interesting. I tend to become fascinated with those types of stories or movies. I enjoy watching the bad man get his as does everybody else, but what is really amazing is that some of the fake weapons used in those movies are used today in real life. What can a person say about a movie you either like it or hate it. I enjoy a good movie and  to be entertained and James bond does it for me. I am looking for the next 007 movie to be released. Casino Royale is one of my collection so if you like pretty women, fast cars, and allot of action this movie is for you. Enjoy
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was a totally ended in a cliff hanger. I admit it was full of twists and turn when you least expect it
B00004WG2F|5.0|This was a good movie a bit drawn out, other than that the story was very well told. It was a story of one mans justice to preserve and protect his family from the outside world. When war comes the father can't protect his son's any longer and he is left alone in the Montana Wilderness. When the war is over we find that one of the bothers has been killed, another goes into politics, while the last son becomes a Great Hunter. Brad Pitt was excellent as the hunter. Anthony Hopkins the father. The supporting actors and actresses were all very good. It also deals with the early bootlegging during the Fall stead act, as well as the corrupt politicians and prejudice acts against the Indians. The  bottom line is this movie is well worth your time to watch it.  You can't go wrong enjoy it.
B005KB0SU6|2.0|Amazingly, this book does not come to par to the fisrt installment of the series. I wouldn't even recomend it.
B00008PBZW|5.0|Windtalkers is  very graphic War movie it was action from the opening frame to the closing scene I really enjoyed this movie if you like war stories this movie is for you.
B00AFPVPDG|2.0|Waste of time.  The methodology is OK (just OK) but when this guy poses himself as teacher of six different disciplines ugghh!. - sexy title, but that is it.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I like this game except that it all but forces you to buy in game content to be able to use any of the dragons. You will never get enough crowns otherwise to unlock them.<br />Otherwise the game is fun to play and does require as small amount of strategy to progress through the levels.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Good book it is well written. No problem downloading and if you want to have an eye opener read the book.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Great book about life and discovering who you are doesn't matter where you come from it is about dealing with life.
B009K86D86|3.0|This documentary is eye opening in some respects.  Even though it is eye opening it is massively biased.  There is some pretty reprehensible behavior committed by the food manufacturers but nothing worse than I expected.  If you are one of those preachy vegan types, this is probably your favorite documentary.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I liked the story itself, but a couple of parts were not believable and I did not really like the narrator angle much.
B00DI5DPE2|5.0|One of my favorite works by one of my favorite artist. Very nice detail in the recording. .I cant wait for more.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I was having problems with &#34;blank&#34;icons on my Kindle Fire HD. The use of this product did a good job of cleaning my Kindle and all but 2 of the icons now display correctly.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I originally viewed it on PBS and it was so wonderful that I had to have it.  This copy was a gift for a friend.  She already had it so she returned it.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Another wonderful success for Susan Boyle.  Her CD's are always a pleasure to listen to and give as gifts for Christmas.  I actually bought 4, Susan's music is always worth sharing with those you love!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Takes too long for lives to reload.  Also it would be great if player would be given some ideas how to play.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this!  This story is a truly unique telling of a tale that has been told over and over.  I couldn't put it down. Fell in love with the characters as well.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Excellent movie if you are looking for action and bloodshed! It will keep you on your toes the whole movie!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really enjoy the game while waiting in doctors office. Really does help pass the time. Works well on the kindle fire and graphics are excellent.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|If you like King, this won't dissapoint. He always has a new twist on something the reader thinks he/she has figured out. Fun to read and as comfortable as a pair of old loafers.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|Tag along around the house! Tagged the car cell phone holder to start up nav automatically. very east to use.
1452126577|5.0|Really cute and funny.  This is a must have for all your cat lover friends.  I bought it for our adult son, but just had to read it first.
B005HP2J66|1.0|I bought this in hopes of sharing it with my students. I fell asleep watching it. Too long and too melodramatic. Way too much time spent on trying to make people be in awe. Had the potential to be great but I never connected.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like that I can play this game with or without Internet. it get more changelging to play as you go on.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love this app:-)  I<br />It is a great way to read-I seem to read more and faster.  I just love it
B00846REIS|4.0|It is written with sensual style<br />Very  passionate.  I would recommend<br />To my friends who want romance<br />That turns you on!<br />:-)
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|what an awesome and talented young lady! many songs are both simple and complex at the same time! the whole thing sounds great
0071373586|5.0|Great book. Lots of never aging ideas, lots of real life examples. Should be read by anybody who is interested or involved in marketing business. Very easy language, so actually I could recommend this book for anyone.
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|Pretty good album.  The first song is definitely the best (Prey for Me) and really rocks.  Excellent energy and vocals.  The next two songs are really good too, but the rest of the album not so much.  Not saying it's bad, just doesn't have quite the energy that Korn typically delivers.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|Long detailed scenes dragged on. The bleakness of the black and white imagery portrayed the sadness of a lonely life. But it net too far
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game!!! Anyone who loves minions better buy this game. The updates R free, you can also dress your minion up!!! I have a ref!! Takes a little bit to load but it is fun!!!!
B00656C6KK|5.0|I love it!  A great addition to other CD's that I have of Doris Day!  I really love that wonderful mellow voice of hers. She is one of the best!!!  Thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK IT IS SO SUSPENSEFUL AND A GREAT BOOK TO READ. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN AT ALL.
0385351399|2.0|Just another version of how technology will take over our society. Too much fiction on our future already available. Better subject....How can we prevent it?
B00BAXFECK|3.0|The Goldfinch started out brilliantly, but got bogged down in the middle and seemed to come to a somewhat hurried and contrived ending. The characters were interesting, and I very much appreciate Tartt's masterful use of words to engage all senses in this book, but the plot itself was a bit meandering.  Loved Secret History so perhaps my expectations were too high.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow--full of surprises--Great conclusion to the series--although sad.  I will reread this series sometime in the future.  I highly recommend it!!!
B001I45UFC|3.0|The first book in the series is probably the easiest to read. It is the simplest.<br /> The four main characters are Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie. Lucy finds a magical land in the upstairs wardrobe and when she tells her brothers and sister they don't believe her. Edmund the naughty child gets into trouble and almost ruins everything for everyone when he meets a wicked witch inside the magical land of Narnia, the land that is inside the wardrobe. Of course like in every story everything ends up working out for almost everyone.<br /> This is mostly for young children, though some teens and adults like it. Though it can be entertaining I think it is very simple and below me. When I was younger I loved this book, but after reading such books as the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, and Twilight (which have more depth), I am not impressed with this book. There could be more action and magic. There wasn't enough back story and won't be till five books later.<br /> If someone asked me whether they should read this or their child. I would have to say that their child should, but as to them (if they were a teen or adult) it would depend on there tastes. I'm not saying the book is terrible, just that it is simple and that it could have been better. Even saying all of this I have read this book about five times and in future will probably read it again.
1593275080|4.0|When I pre ordered the product page said it was a Hard cover when I got the book I was Very disappointed it was not and felt mislead about the product.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|The action-packed scene of the plane crash kept me on the edge of my seat.  The drama that unfolds afterwards is soul satisfying.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun to play but difficult to get tokens and several things require an insane amount of tokens to buy. Plus when I had 180 tokens at one time and then went into game one day and suddenly only had 1 token. If I can't get my tokens back might as well give up since the achievements have already been completed and there is no way to earn those tokens again!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I got really frustrated reading this book. It only tries to make a point that the main character was ignorant and simpleminded. It also proposes the case for &#34;pure luck&#34; for the development of Christianity, and not a clear revolution on the way common people started seeing the world. The book does not deserve the praises in top-magazines.
B008U3NU38|5.0|Okay, I DO love this BUT BUT BUT it is NOT complete as advertised. As mentioned in many places, it is missing Justice Tonight/Kick it Over (Basically a longer version of Armageddon Time)<br />Mustapha Dance (Basically a 1/2 instrumental remix version of Rock the Casbah)<br />Robber Dub (Basically a remix of Bankrobber)<br />Am I happy with the remastered sound and packaging YES, do I feel ripped off that even $200 doesn't buy you newly remastered versions of the above, MOST DEFINITELY!!
B0050DIWHU|1.0|This book is more of the same. The basic recommendation is to have a plan and backup plans with a very limited horizon - the long term will be excellent if you focus on optimizing your short-term options. It is not the path for success for too many people to take this advice seriously.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I began reading the book as soon as I received it on my Kindle. The informatiom has been life changing. All the blood work the Doctor recommended has been completed. I am awaiting the results.
B00G9B1MEM|4.0|One of the best looking games ever for the tablet or phone. Really looks like you are plying with clay. The game controls are easy but the games is challenging. My eight year old loves it. It plays very well on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|No book has moved me so emotionally than this one. It's not the best book in the series as there wasn't much going on for most of the book but the ending was exciting and very emotional. Roth has a lot of words of wisdom sprinkled throughout the book as the characters learn to forgive and grow through various challenges. I'm looking forward to Roth's next endeavor.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Best two person fighting game app I've seen yet. Fantastic graphics and game layout. Pick your robot and box. When you win you work your way up in the ranks by earning points and money. The controls are easy but the game is far from it. Very tough and challenging, even after you master your robots special moves.  Make sure you have your in-game purchasing turned off or your child may spend his college fund.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0345803485|1.0|I don't mind a sexy read, but this was beyond just that.  It set women back a generation or two and is a terrible read for young women just learning who they are as women.
B00G4CXHSK|4.0|Mario styled game where you take a little man through a 2D journey while shooting or avoiding zombies and other assortmemts or evil characters. Fun and challenging to play, Easy to use controls. Graphics are good but not amazing.<br /><br />Recommended
0375842209|5.0|Enthralling!!!  One of my favorite all time reads and I would encourage everyone to read it.  I'm so glad they have turned it into a movie and can't wait to see it!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Excellent calculator app especially when you consider it's free. Not much to say here that the other thousand reviewers haven't already said, but the calculator works great on the Kindle Fire HD. I like that it can be used in landscape or vertical mode. The scientific calculator is a bit over my son's head but the standard calculator is perfect for his schooling now. The buttons are large and easy to use and the graphics are clean and precise. Two thumbs up for Amazon offering this free app.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0525478817|4.0|This is a copy/paste from my Goodreads review. Please see my other reviews.<br />Those who read my Goodreads reviews know I am brutal in my scathing, fault-finding comments on my latest conquest in the world of literature. Not so with this book. How do I do it justice? Where to start? Until recently my only experience with teen-cancer novels were those saccharine Lurlene McDaniel teen paperbacks from the 80's. This book blows those out of the water.<br />The story and characters. The story felt real, it flowed naturally, it was believable and kept me turning pages. Hazel, the main character, was an every-girl, didn't matter that she had cancer, was more a side-note because her narration wasn't narcissistic. She didn't have to be a butt-kicking hero like so many other teen protagonists inundating adolescent literature today. She was just a teen girl trying to live her life. And Gus turned out to be the author's unintentional Edward Cullen creation because he was THERE for our heroine sans any cheese and we rooted for them. [I wanted to hate the sex scene but I couldn't. I wanted to hate Gus dying before they could marry and live happily every after but I couldn't. I wanted to groan and roll my eyes at Van Houten's appearance at the funeral but I couldn't. (hide spoiler)] The story demanded that these things happen to these characters and John Green is to be commended. It didn't make me cry but I understand why so many other readers recommend packing along a box a tissues before starting this novel. This is good writing and dang good storytelling. Read this book and pass it on for it fully deserved its place on the New York Times Bestseller list. I'm looking forward to the movie, especially if Willem Dafoe is playing Van Houten, excellent choice!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of the best series I've seen in a long time... The story line is fantastic and Claire Danes is phenomenal.  I can wait to purchase the entire series...
0920668372|5.0|I still cry every time I read it to them, 5 years later. My children and I enjoy reading this book often.  It is so sweet.
1492886491|4.0|This was a quirky little book. Fast paced, funny & exciting. I wish it had been a bit longer, I have a hard time wanting to get invested in a book under 200 pages. Also, I do not like when an author at the end requests good comments only on their books. But I thought it was good so he lucked out with me!
B00BI489P0|2.0|Kindle version doesn't have a table of contents. Can't skip ahead to the play I want to read. Poor search tool.
0930289234|4.0|I saw the movie first and then read the book afterward to fill in the many questions that I had after watching the movie. The movie was great. It is very true to the book. I feel that there is quite a bit of over hype on this franchise, but nonetheless it is a terrific story and I am glad that I finally got around to experiencing it. It really is an epic superhero story that I feel is superior to X-Men. Personally, I liked the movie much more than that graphic novel, but you almost have to read the novel to get the full meaning of everything going on in the film.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Dungeon hunter 4 is a great game, my only complaint is that there should be more land to explore. But it's still awesome.
B00005YJMX|4.0|I went into this film with very high expectations. Bruno Ganz was exceptional in Downfall, and I was interested in seeing his early work. It is a very creepy and interesting film and I really enjoyed it, however it's not one that will appeal to today's masses. It's very slowly paced and more psychological than a horror movie. The use of color, light, and music really set the gothic tone well. I can see this as a film that would be studied by film students more than one that would make for a movie night at home with friends. In fact, I think this one is best viewed alone, unless those with you are serious about watching this film. There are elements of the film that are almost Kubrick-esque, such as long segments without a single spoken word. I would recommend it to those interested in foreign classic movies. It is not a movie that I could watch repeatedly and therefore would personally never purchase the DVD.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Beat game gives me more thing that I have to do and a lot more to do with the things I make.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I decided after months of hearing friends talk about &quot;candy crush&quot; an addictive fun game that sucks you in, to see what the hoopla was for myself. I downloaded it, started playing and was hooked passing several levels until I got to one I couldn't instantly conquer and was determined to try, try, and try again.....until my lives ran out. I love this game, it's a fun, easy way to have some &quot;me&quot; time. However I am cheap and when my lives run out you have to either wait the allotted time to regain lives or pay for more, which I do not do. So that's the only frustrating thing. Although when it happens I put my kindle down and decide it's probably time for a break anyhow :)
0062124293|3.0|Very odd language, and at times she is very good at contradicting herself, which will certainly throw the reader off, but her honesty keeps the reader going.
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|worst game ever!  I had to delete all of my games for it because I thought it would be a good game but then it wouldn't download.  I waited days forit to work..I Want my mony back do not get this game
0300108834|5.0|Perfect condition, timely shipping.  As for the books itself, I am reading Gombrich's The Story of Art and love it so much, I know I will love A Little History.  His language is so comprehensible, concise, informational, and enlightening that I couldn't resist the purchase and am looking forward to its contents.  He intentionally wants to write for those who are not the lofty academic for which I am grateful!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Exciting. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Denzel Washington movies.  Great movie.  Excellent performance by Denzel Washingtion!
B00C5R71U8|5.0|Fascinating book. For someone like myself who is a fan of design but is not a designer it was extremely interesting to learn more about Jony Ive and the overall design process at apple.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad that kindle finally got candy crush. This is the best game there is. I play all the time. I just wish you could get more lives.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is such a great storyteller and this continues the saga, in a different direction, that began in &#34;A Time to Kill,&#34;, which I have always thought was his best book.  Just the way Grisham tells a story keeps you intrigued.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|i am so in love with this movie. it is such a great movie and i have shared it with everyone it know. i highly reccommend this to anyone! of all ages.!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not many apps support chromecast unless you are using youtube and paid content provider apps. Think about Apple TV if you are an Apple fan.
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|great movie! i love this movie and am so pleased its on blu ray! its a great movie! i would recommend this to anyone who likes old movies
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Such a great story line. All the characters we know from the first movie plus more. Great whole family movie!
B000AP04MO|5.0|what a great movie.! i love audrey and reccomend this movie to everyone! my sister and i watch it all the time!
B00BCWOWKY|4.0|Enjoyable, I just wish they wouldn't say, &#34;That begs the question&#34; when they mean &#34;That raises the question.&#34; Lawyers (and writers of lawyerly dialogue) should know better.
B00003CXCD|5.0|great movie. i love aufrey and couldnt be happier with this purchase never seen it untill i bought and and im glad i did.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I updated my 2013 nexus 7 tablet to android 4.4 and now the game won't open at all..even tried uninstalling and reinstalling..cclearimg cache etc. Please fix if possible.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|what a great movie audrey is such an amazing actress! she plays this role so well i recommend this to veryone!
B007R11DKQ|5.0|My family loves this movie. It's not for younger kids, but 13 and up will love it!! Watch it tonight
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|BECAREFUL. this would work great if it actually worked. yes it does score the bottle but it is very very very easy to make your score lien crooked.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Good book, decent plot. Kat's motivations aren't always clear for me and some of the characters face the problem of being too similar in ambition and archetype but overall would recommend for a 1-2 day read in your spare time.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|this is my second favorite movie and its a classic. who could go wrong with buying this? came packaged very well and not a scratch to be found!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As always, a wonderful and terrorizing escape. The Shining questions answered. Thank you! I feel like a kid in wonderment being told a story by a master.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|i love titanic and i love even more that its on blu ray! this is a great movie! such a great love story / tragedy!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|The Music Man is a classic set in turn of the twentieth century Iowa. Humor, romance, and lots of music. Classic songs like 76 Trombones and Marian the Librarian. It's appropriate for all audiences. And this edition is closed captioned.
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|Opened it up plugged it in to my Yamaha receiver, paired it with my Samsung galaxy and it sounds great.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|It could have some dress up B-) katy via gift of me a reason to believe that the movie very much not fair to believe that the movie very much not fair to believe that the movie very much not fair to believe that the movie very much not fair to the public sector in time and money in school of medicine in time for the public and private sectors in school I made this or what the public sector workers at the movie very much not fair.
B00ER23V1W|5.0|Is very good this soubtrack. The musics are very beautiful. The style is new age. This soundtrack remember the good movie GRAVITY.
B008602KQI|2.0|Strays much too far from the original - &#34;the book itself&#34;. Does not do much to go into depth of character development. Probably will not go see the 2nd film of this trilogy.
080412115X|5.0|Excellent story, the LARGE type is great for the generation that getting older.  Grisham is a favorite in this house.
B00C5R8364|2.0|The characters were plastic and uninteresting.  Story could have been better with decently developed characters.  I expect more from Forsyth.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very good book especially if you've read A Time To Kill. This one is a different kind of story but has the same small town lawyer, Jake Brigance&#34;, and as in the other, has a race issue. In this one you never know why it is named Sycamore Row until the very last chapter. Very well written.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I was thoroughly entertained by this book.  I was needing a 'lighter' read and this was a great choice.  I laughed out loud many times while reading this book.
B000K15VSA|5.0|One of my favorite science fiction movies of all time. I got lucky when I bought this sucker. Now the price is pretty high, even for used. I love collector's editions of movies, games, etc. This remains one of my favorite ever. I want to buy the blu-ray as well, in the recent 4-disc edition that includes yet another spinner vehicle replica toy. The price went up, so I may be waiting awhile on that one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent book. Very powerful.  One of our book club selections from several years ago.  It's one of the best books I've read in years.  When asked for book recommendations this is always my first suggestion.
B000I0RNVG|3.0|If I were just rating the movie, it'd be 5 stars easy. however, this is for the physical dvd collection itself. it comes with some memorabilia, sure, and the soundtrack. The special features on the dvds themselves is lacking. Compare something like this to the limited/collector's editions of Inception and Blade Runner. I didn't pay too much so I definitely got the value, but looking at the picture you just expect more than you actually receive.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I've been waiting for a good Sci-Fi movie for a while and 'Oblivion&#34; filled the need.  There is a great story slowly developing to keep the viewer going along for the ride.  The special effects were well done and the acting is good as well.  Even though I'm not a Tom Cruise fan he just keeps putting out good movies.  if you are a Sci-Fi fan like me, grab a soda and some popcorn and travel into the future with this very entertaining story.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Quite possibly my favorite anime movie. At the very least, tied with Princess Mononoke. It was just plain wonderful. The world within the internet universe created here was magnificent. The animation was gorgeous and the characters memorable. If you love anime, you likely saw this one already. Nothing more to be said.
B00E5N8E2O|4.0|The live &#34;Hysteria&#34; stuff is great -- especially the songs they never play live -- but the real perks included the obscure songs only the diehards can appreciate, i.e., &#34;Wasted,&#34; &#34;Mirror Mirror&#34; and the entire Side A of &#34;High & Dry.&#34;
B0000DFZZC|4.0|I liked the movie, and this set was a must have since it's a collector's set. Outside of that, I never really looked much into its features, because the movie isn't one of my favorites. I don't have a lot of time to devote to everything I wish I could. Still, if you love the movie, very likely you want this in your collection. Plain and simple.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Good game for the kids and they are having fun so I think it is not bad and I love the game too.It's a good game it better than the other games.
0756404746|5.0|I picked up this book along with The Way of Kings, while the other I've yet to finish, I just read right through this beast. I don't know what it was, I mean this sucker's 700 pgs+ and I was just immersed in the story and the world of it all. Of course there were elements I wanted to know about that were never revealed in this first installment. I look forward to reading the continuation at some point in the future.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Works great. Easy set up. Good battery life. Solid volume control. Charging unit work in cig lighter or USB hookup. Bought another for my brother.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|when it works its fun. when it screws up... annoying! and its been screwing up a lot lately. the underwater part doesn't work hardly at all.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|One of the best hunting games I have played for a mobile device. The weapons are rewarding and the areas are beautifully crafted.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book. Well written. Spell binding. Interesting characters. Dark plot, but fun to read. Big fan of Gillian Flynn. Can't wait for her next book.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Great new artist, I love all the songs on this album. She is going to be a great singer. Awesome
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I've always loved this movie and not realizing I didn't have it on dvd, prompted me to finally buy it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoyed the story. Parts of the plot were obvious but the characters were excellent. The technical discussion of counterfeiting seemed plausible. I would recommend the book to a friend.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. This is the 1st been I've finished this fast in a while. I can't wait to read the next one!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|First of all I think the game sucks cause it's a game about midgets serving for a creep who don't give a S***    Also it makes me pay freaking 6 bucks for the game I recommend temple run or temple run2
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Looks great on my kindle fire.  I enjoy that energy is not a needed resource.  Just patience.  However...dragons are too expensive.  I do buy game currency when reasonable...but if more than 20.00 is needed to buy ONE thing I think its not worth that...overall a good game and you don't HAVE to spend real money.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Easy to read and informative.  I knew a lot of this, but I now I really know about a lot if this.<br />Thanks.
B00BRGL44C|5.0|Sound:<br />This re-mastering in Blu-ray audio is much better than the \\"original-image-bit-processing\\" CD version. The bass is tighter, deeper, and more detailed with the right timbre. Somehow the timpani in the CD version sounds a bit out of tune, even when I hear that with my 2012 laptop, equipped with Dolby Home Theater v4, and my AKG K240 headphones. The timpani in the blu-ray version sounds right!<br /><br />I love the reverberation produced in the Musikvereinssaal (Vienna) hall, too!<br /><br />Some technical details:<br />I play the blu-ray with an external BD player. The software attached to the player allows me to select TrueTheater Surround as an audio output mode. Although the display of the blu-ray says: \\"2.0 PCM 24-bit/96 KHz\\", \\"2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio 24-bit/96 KHz\\", and \\"2.0 Dolby TrueHD 24-bit/96 KHz\\" -- so it's not 5.0 surround! (like the earlier SACD version[?]), the TrueTheater Surround in the software allows me to choose \\"2 speaker\\", \\"headphones\\", \\"4 speaker\\", \\"6 speaker\\", and \\"8 speaker\\", of which the \\"4 speaker\\" sounds the best in my ears, with \\"Music mode-standard\\" configuration for the \\"multi-channel environment impression mode\\".<br /><br />Interpretation:<br />I love Kleiber's interpretation of Beethoven's 5th symphony, in particular. IMHO, Kleiber's interpretation of the 5th symphony overall is better than Giulini's (though the 4th movement by Giulini has more detail, probably due to its [much] slower pace), Karajan's 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s versions, Klemperer's 1950s version, and Tilson Thomas's recent 2000s version. More specifically, Kleiber's first movement of Beethoven's 5th symphony is wow -- just wow. It's not too fast (e.g., Chailly's or Gardiner's versions), not too slow (e.g., that of Klemperer or Barenboim).<br /><br />Personally speaking, I prefer \\"modern instrument\\" like that of Kleiber to \\"period instrument\\" (e.g., Gardiner's).<br /><br />Beethoven's 7th is more rhythmic than lyrical, I think, and Kleiber makes this symphony very powerful. I personally like Beethoven's 5th better than his 7th symphony, so that's all I can comment on it, but it's a very fine recording nonetheless.<br /><br />Thanks DG for re-issuing this legendary recording in blu-ray, especially because the DVD-audio version produced in 2004 has been very rare (and ridiculously expensive!) on the U.S. Amazon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was really different. I haven't played this type of game before and will look for more. I also went to YouTube for help with the blue weight in room 6 but got everything else on my own. I will keep it and wait for more rooms.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is so Awesommeee ~!! Somee of yall cant finddd it but i can !! Lol yall cant see !  Yall r soo freakin funniii
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I had a hard time checking the shipping dock stuff but  other than that the app is awesome i had a fun time playing it its like super addicting if u ain't got time it's not for u...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game, so addictive! Only bad part is waiting on energy. But don't take as long as some games.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A good sequel, with no real need to have read the original. This is not Grisham's best but a good solid read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best game of the whole world it's great for the children and very addictive it is awesome
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|User interface is clear and concise.  My first gen fire was giving me the message that I had no space. After doing everything I could think of without any change,  I went to the forums and saw this recommended many times. So I figured &quot;why not? It couldn't hurt.&quot; Love this app. I now have TONS of space. Thank you to the makers I am forever a fan!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so much fun! I stay up all night playing it. I think everyone who enjoys temple run will LOVE minion rush!!!!
1400095204|5.0|Excellent Book, great story, the character development is incredible, it's told from the perspectives of each character in a way that will blow you away.  But this book!<br /><br />It's my favorite book of 2013!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|A totally addictive, sensual & satisfying read. I can't wait to get started on the next instalment of Gideon & Eva's story & hope there will be much more to cone. Just don't want it to stop.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Completely and utterly beautiful. Green makes you think about life and how precious it really is. Hazel is one of my favorite protagonists specifically because her mortality is understood from the get go. She knows she will die and readers know she will die, but that gives it a more interesting perspective on life that any other fictitious character has ever had. John Green, you are awesome.
0143118706|5.0|&#34;Committed&#34; is a wonderful follow up to &#34;Eat Pray Love&#34;.  Elizabeth Taylor weaves a wonderful story. She is both charming and witty.
B005HEDIHG|4.0|It's dated, but never clearer picture of the 60's TV series.  I loved it in the 60's growing up, and still like the original very much.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A real page turner.  You will have surprise after surprise.  One you cannot put down.  A murder mystery, a lawyer novel, and a historical novel all rolled into one.  A great read!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! It was very well written with endearing characters.  The narrative of the book is from two voices who tell the story from their own perspective. Even though parts of the story were disturbing, the history of the south was told in a compelling story.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The graphics and details are better than the last version. Still feeling it out and learning all the details, but I like it so far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is fun for all ages and the holiday updates are so much fun. Recently I updated to the Christmas update
B00902AKK4|5.0|And I'm a 51 yo &quot;gemmie&quot; of 6!  It started out easy enough. I just start playing it and suddenly I realize an hour has gone by! That never happens to me on what I consider a kiddie game. I'm one of those &quot;bad&quot; grammas who can't stand Disney films or cartoons (I know, I'm one sick puppy! :) and forget about kiddie games. But in this case I gotta change my mind because 1) the theme music is awesome, 2) the ladybug is kinda cute and 3) the puzzles are actually fun and thought provoking even for an adult.<br /><br />Haven't seen anything too annoying other than the constant &quot;Rate Me&quot; requests that keep popping up. I decided to do it this time just to see if it'll acknowledge the fact I did it.<br /><br />I'd deduct a star just for that if I wasn't having so much fun with the game that I'm giving them a waiver for the annoyance but I would HIGHLY suggest to the devs that when someone hits the &quot;No, Thanks&quot; that you acknowledge that in the game and leave them alone. Same for those who do as I did and leave a review because you don't want to get a bad review because they've had enough of the harassment to rate the game. No sense losing stars for a fun game just because of something that correctable. (And before anyone says that I should just hit the no thanks button, I did...a number of times and every time I'd start playing, up it'd pop again so I gave it a chance)<br /><br />But aside from that negative which I already went over, this is a great, fun game for old and young alike.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Really addicting fun game!!! you can spend hours playing it and it does'nt get old!! I would reccomend it to anyone
B006S01GH2|5.0|Funny, unusual, entertaining, wholesome, simply a great distraction.  This is a good movie for couples, families- anyone looking for enjoyable low-key entertainment.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Nice dictionary. Doesn't have all the word, but is still very good Recommended for middle schoolers probably. Cool. Lol. Hi ,
B00DW3GJK2|5.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! should be required viewing for every high school and college student in the United States, and it appears to be a well-rounded account from the Japanese side as well. I feel comfortable assigning the watching of it as homework to my tutees who are half Japanese. The movie shows many things that went wrong to allow Pearl Harbor to happen. It opened my eyes to a lot of things that could have and should have been handled differently. Hopefully, we will learn from the mistakes shown in this movie. It is acceptable for middle schoolers as well but is too violent for most children under 10.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love big books like this one. It was a great book. I can't wait to get The Mark Of Athena.
B00CIH371W|5.0|When I started reading this I have to admit to my eyebrows raising and thinking where on earth is this book trying to go?! I really didn't get into the book right away, however, and this is a HUGE however, once it clicked into place as to where the story may be heading I was caught in the web (I know huge groan) of the plot and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The story is about a 24year old woman who has run from her boyfriend of 3 years having discovered what his family business entails. Sara thinks that she has hidden her trail well but when a ring arrives at the hotel where she is staying containing a poisonous spider as a gift for her and bites another woman who then disappears she thinks that the family may have managed to catch up with her. She moves out of the hotel into a house belonging to a friend of her new boyfriend, Brett.<br /><br />However when strange things start to happen when she is sleeping and Brett starts to behave strangely she has to get away. Who can she trust and what is happening to her.<br /><br />The story is well written and I loved the suspense aspect of it. At one point I was worried that the book may end up being too long upon looking at how much I had read at one point. I was thinking how can they fill the rest of the story but oh boy did they fill it!!<br /><br />The story, once going, gallops along at a great pace with many twists and turns along the way. It is hard to say too much about why I enjoyed specific parts of the book and why it gripped me like it did as it would give away too much of the plot. All I can say is that it is a great suspense book with a twist. I can't explain that twist too much as it will really ruin the story.<br /><br />Please note I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|I like the new theme for Star Trek and this album has some good music to work by; I like how he incorporated the original Star Trek theme into some of the tracks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing so many cliffhangers and I was reading non stop I never wanted to take my eyes off the pages can't wait to see the movie
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It was so easy to access and work with my acrobat documents saved in the kindle. This app is very flexible, unlike other apps around...........
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I could not put this book down..so realistic..so many unexpected twists..great suspense..My only disappointment was I was sorry the story couldn't go on and on..Highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Got bored a couple of times reading it through. The desire wasnt as the first book in the mockinjay series. Good book to read though......
B008RA3X5E|3.0|For a paid app I expected more features and graphical options. Was hoping for more background graphics and display options.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|5 stars out of five I wish this series would never end. Wonderful. Brilliant.  Thrilling. Consuming.  Romantic. Action. And adventure.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief struggled to understand and survive life in Nazi Germany by stealing rich people's books. The descriptions make this book real visual.
B00AGDY4AI|5.0|We love this one as a fmaily.  It is a great comedy - great if you need a good clean laugh!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Received this item so fast, it almost arrived before I finished ordering!  A favorite film, now I won't have to change discs mid-movie.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Enjoyed the game.  Good storyline with excellent graphics.  Wish it flowed a little smoother but overall worth it.  Will be glad when the next one is available.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|An ok read. It bounced around a little. Some interesting information but overall not as good as outliers or tipping point.
B0019IB0II|5.0|My sister had a stroke so a friend referred the book to me.  It was so clear on what could go wrong and totally change a life after a stroke....and the talents the caregivers had to help her adjust and relearn.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is great cause it is so much like temple run and a hole lot of different games
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Really challenging ! Love this great game fun for all ages. :) very nice for being a free game.. thank you Appstore
B007URVZJ6|5.0|solid instructions.  step by step with detailed ms word tips for kindle formatting.  good buy<br /><br />especially enjoyed the tips on areas of importance to readers.
0545265355|5.0|These books are amazing!!! Highly recommend them to all ages. And all the pages are nice and crisp. Trust me, they are worth it.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This is a great watch. I have received many compliments on this watch. It looks great feels great. I am very happy with this purchase and would happily recomend to anyone who is looking for a good quality watch at a great price. Will definetly be buying another Invicta watch. Super happy with the quality.
B00CATSONE|1.0|I made it half way through this book, hoping that it would be about Tesla. Don't get me wrong there are references to Tesla in the book but, it reads more like a self help book from the eighties that a biography on the man. The information that is in the book, that is about Tesla, can be found in a better format on Wikipedia.<br />I didn't pay anything for the book. It was free. I must insist it wasn't worth the price.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Can't get app to work. It did. Now it says it has to be updated yet I can not find anywhere to update it. I've totally removed the app from the device and uploaded  it again with the same results. My granddaughter is very disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great. Lots of fun. Millions are wonderful. Running through the lab is very interesting. Lots more locations to discover.<br />Amazing.
B00FK04JY8|5.0|Excellent sophomore album.  Diane builds on what she created on her debut, Bible Belt, by pushing the boundaries of her blues and pop songwriting roots and blending it into sonic landscapes, layered with synth and solid harmonies.  Her voice is strong and assured, and she sings about what she knows.  You're with her for the ride.  It's an album you can put on repeat and be glad when it begins again.  Standout tracks are Lighthouse and All The Love You Got.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love it you should play to<br /> Its the best game ever because there hover boards jet packs mega head starts etc.Its so cool
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app is the best simulation app ever. It has features graphics that never go blurry. I love this app
B0015AARJI|1.0|My original PS3 controller lasted for three years - through all of the pain, throwing it on the floor - everything. This one lasted one month, and all that happened is that it fell from the couch to the carpeted floor.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|LOVED this game. Relaxing to use especially when waiting at the doctors office. Buy it and relax. The color was excellent and the sounds are relaxing.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I don't know why this is onmy list to review. I would never buy anything from this hypocritical whore. Anyone who claims to have &#34;no regrets&#34; is someone you want to avoid at all costs.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very good so far. I needed a way to look at my files and this does the trick. The price was right too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a game for everyone. It's really fun to play. You have many different characters and many different countries to play in.  It's a game you must have!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game...to my Demise but I'm so glad it's finally glad it's finally on my kindle. I play this game all the time.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I'm not a big fan of wartime stories. Too often, the whole conflict is set up for the writer. Then the writer throws in some deaths, and some young characters with tremendous fortitude, and it gets reviewed by critics as a beautiful story about the human condition.<br /><br />But that's all a generalization. Let's talk about this book in particularly. I'll start with my criticism: I didn't like the ending. I can't say too much more without spoiling it, but I will say that the ending is absolutely in line with what you would expect from a wartime story. It seemed like the author was thinking to himself, “Let’s make this grand ending that spawns a million book group discussions about the horrors of war.” No, let’s not. Let’s write a book that takes place during wartime and not a single person dies. Now THAT would be original.<br /><br />Now that I’ve gotten the criticism out of the way, here’s what I did like about the book:<br />(1) It’s a book that takes place during World War II, and the main characters are German, and yet they’re portrayed as the good guys. They even say Heil Hitler!! It takes some balls to write a book like that, and it takes some talent to pull that off.<br />(2) The narrator is the Grim Reaper, and Zusak pulls this off so successfully. Rather than portraying the Reaper as evil, he portrays him as just a person doing their job. The Reaper accepts that death is a natural part of existence, but still recognizes that some people have been given the opportunity to live richer, fuller lives than others. And the Reaper comes to admire those people that fervently fight off death. All in all, the narration was tastefully done.<br />(3) The writing was immensely readable. Zusak’s a story teller. He’s not an intellectual trying to impress you with his philosophies, or a poet trying to use nouns as verbs to impress you. Just a storyteller, which I happen to like.<br />(4) Liesel is so, so likeable. So is Rudy Steiner. So are her foster parents and just about all the characters. And the reason they’re likeable is not because they’re written as these wonderful, selfless people who never do anything wrong. It’s because they do things that are wrong. They make selfish or dumb decisions, but they genuinely care about one another and they’re overall good people.<br /><br />And since I have come up with four things I love about the book and only one piece of criticism, it gets four stars from me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great character development and gradual, suspenseful story development. Focuses on the inner struggles and decisions that often turn out differently than planned.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This book was interesting..weird..but interesting. I wanted to keep reading just to see what happened but I'm left feeling disappointed. Nothing is ever really explained and he always forgets everything in the end. Plus Lettie never returning was kind of lame. Meh.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A better written hunger games, dystopia for written for and about adults...far exceeded epectations! Would have never though this was slf published.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is challenging and addictive. It's a great way to pass the time. I love how the objects switch positions on every level.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun addictive app. There are 2 things I want/need fixed. One, I would like unlimited moves on every level. Two, I would like to not run out of lives. Other than that great app. I'm so glad it's on kindle fire. Thanks!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I do like this game.  I just have not figured it all out yet. There is a lot to figure out,  but it is all worth it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Still the classic I remember from my childhood. The entire series gets better and more sociologically relevant every time I read it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Classic Book. How I missed this in Highschool and college is beyond me since I am a sci-fi nut. EXCELLENT book in character study and in story line.  I cannot wait to read the next one in the series.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|There are simply no words to describe Downton: superb, excellent, amazing....simply do not cover it...best show I have ever seen!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Worked for a very short period of time then just stopped. I managed to get it working once more after much effort and then it stopped again. By working, I mean connecting via Crome to my TV. I can see it on my TV, but it is constantly disappearing from my laptop. Too much effort to restart everything and trouble shoot every time I want to use it. This device is not ready for mass consumption yet, it a beta test / development product. Wait until they figure out all the bugs before purchasing.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|Good vehicle for Arnold but I really loved the story line!  It was well put together!  Great action flick for the guys and great love story for the ladies.
0393088774|4.0|I LOVE PAUL KRUGMAN AND EVERYTHING HE WRITES.  IF ONLY THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE IN WASHINGTON WOULD LISTEN TO HIM.  I NEVER MISS A TALK SHOW HE IS ON AND ALWAYS READ ALL HIS ARTICLES IN THE NYTIMES.  I HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM HIM.
0312287550|5.0|This is one heck of a fun read! Taita the slave-eunuch is impossibly brilliant and accomplished. Tanus the warrior is impossibly heroic, and Lady Lostris is impossibly beautiful and resilient. Egypt is beset by foes within and without. War, peace, adventure, inventions, vast wealth...I don't care if the history holds up or not because it's such an entertaining, satisfying read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|At the start, this game is challenge you. By level 9, the training wheels are taken off with clear square twist.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|When I first got this game I had low expectations but to my surprise it is actually alright. The graphics are ok and the game play is easy better than the Facebook game.
B00445RHKI|5.0|Oh the laughs that my family have had sitting around at Christmas watching these is so worth the  money!!  Fabulous
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Both the kids really love this game. not for adults but wasn't designed to be. Recommend this to anyone with s<br />younger children.
076115678X|5.0|If you want curly hair this book is for you.  My daughter and I used the products that really work and are easy to do.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun espicially if ur bored in a waiting room and have nothing to do meanwhile I highly recommend this game :)
1575666286|4.0|The Gerson Therapy is truly proven to save lives that were otherwise given up for dead.  It is miraculous.  Fabulously healing
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|One of the best reflections as one character was going to be executed....when one life closes and another door opens....and life/soul moves on.....the essence of the movie and is well presented....and the reason why such stories intertwine....a very highly recommended movie to be seen several times over.
B00AMS38YU|4.0|Fun to watch. Suspenseful at parts. One reason to watch is the bike culture. Wish there was more trials riding. A little gimmicky with the visual possible routes for Wilee. Overall good fun.
0425261360|1.0|Tried listening to the audiobook version of this.  Got through a couple discs but then had to stop, it was just too annoying.  I'm not a long-time fan of Scarpetta and have only read one or two of the past books, so perhaps I don't fully appreciate the characters and their development the way some die-hard fans might.  To me, they just seemed to be ridiculous.  Their actions and decision-making did not make much sense to me.  And the character of the ex-cop friend was painful to listen to.  The voice actor used such a dufus-sounding voice for him--which I guess in retrospect was appropriate because everything he said was really dumb!  I honestly just don't see what people who rate this 4-5 stars are appreciating--unless, again, it is primarily long-time fans who are overlooking the huge flaws in this particular book and basing their judgement more on the overall oeuvre of 20-something novels in the series.  Just did not work for me, especially as audio.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Classic Rock FM stations still play every track off this album for good reason.  The reason is this is truly one of the best straight forward Rock & Roll albums of all time with searing guitars and Brad Delp's soaring tenor vocals.  It goes beyond &#34;More Than a Feeling&#34;,  &#34;Peace of Mind&#34;, and &#34;Long Time&#34;, the released singles from this album.  Every cut is terrific, and the energy level is in high drive!  Boston has yet to ever duplicate the power of this debut album from 1976, and I doubt they ever will.  Classic for good reason.
1594744769|5.0|GREAT READING!  Wonderful non-fiction for young adults.  There is a sequel coming soon and I hope it is as good.
0062082353|5.0|Great book.  The author interweaves his personal story with his military experiences.  It's not great literature but it is relatively well-written and highly readable.  It is very candid about things done right (and wrong) in the war.  The author (now tragically deceased) discusses his weapons but I would have preferred more detail.  Nevertheless, it is highly recommended.  Like most heroes, Kyle is self-effacing.
B009JBWOU0|3.0|Batman me gusta, pero lo q. no me gusto de esta trilogía es que solo es format Widescreen y no tiene otros idiomas a seleccionar y los subtítulos pasan muy rápidos
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved every bit of this book . Again Jake goes through the seemingly impossible task of getting justice . Some wonderful turns throughout & at the end! A very good read !
B008JFUO72|5.0|Because I just love his performance, the special effects are so realistic. An exciting way to get away from the daily routine, I'm waiting for more, because more is better.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Was very happy to find a FACEBOOK game that actually plays<br /> on my Kindle like the original. Very happy with it.
0375413405|5.0|It is really easy to follow. The recipes are very well written and have every step laid out, so it looks really time consuming. But, they are not worse than a modern recipe. Every recipe I have made from this book has turned out perfectly. I have also tweaked them and still had excellent results. I would give this to anyone wanting to learn how to cook.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I read the Hunger Games trilogy and I found the ending in the third book disappointing and anti-climatic.  The same thing has happened with this trilogy.  I was really looking forward to the final book and it started out exciting but as I kept reading it became predictable and I found myself rushing to finish it just to get it over with.  Having Trish die in the end didn't really make a lot of sense and I felt it was unnecessary.  I felt the first two books were well written and very enjoyable but the last book fell short.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|As other reviewers have noted, this is a wonderful book, though the last third was not as mesmerizing as the first two thirds of the book. Some of the writing is downright magical,some of the writing is downright wordy. Wish the spell had lasted through to the end but still worth the effort.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I enjoy the game because it has so many things to do. You don't have time to get bored with it as with other games similar to it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|First a really good opening, then a nice story, then a sad, lovely and funny one with love and emotion
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game moves fast very addictive. Like being able to play offline for the most part<br />Wish it was easier to earn crowns<br /><br />Krybij
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a great book.  You really got to know the characters and I was sorry to reach the end.  Maybe there will be another book of the next generation.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This is my favorite series of novels and Lee Child is my favorite author. This series is unusual because it is not getting old even though Jack Reacher is getting older and there have been a lot of Reacher novels. This is Reacher remembering back to his last days.on active duty, which coincide almost exactly with my last days as an officer on active duty before cutting my Army career short of a full 20 years, with no further obligations, to start my nomadic life. The events in this novel come right up to the days before the first novel in this series, and are told during an interval in Reacher' s life as he works his way south and east toward Virginia with his broken nose still not fully healed, but healing fast. I highly recommend this and every Jack Reacher novel.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This is one of the cutest game I have come across in a long time.  I could play for hours if the issues with crashes would be fixed. Have spent a lot of money on this game. When I've had issues with not receiving my purchase, I have to say, Zynga is excellent with helping to resolve the problem. I really like this game, just wish they would fix the recent issues with the crashes.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I don't watch much television, but I was riveted to this series.  Yes, some of the situations are extremely improbable, but that did not ruin it for me.  I haven't seen the second half of the final season yet and can't wait!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I thought it was darn good although story line is easily figured out it is well done. why do I have to add more words?
B005GQ5IA0|4.0|Really interesting and a gripping story. Not a huge fan of the ending but it's better than the Will Smith movie.
B004SFWF5Q|4.0|Cate is always great no matter what and Mr Crudup is very good also but did anyone notice that on this page,not the other one,with the higher price but just this page, the cast of another movie is listed (FOR THE MOMENT, an excellent early R Crowe film)?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I just finished reading The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. It's takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's about a boy who's friend commits suicide when he's in middle school, and about his first year of high school. It highlights many of the problems teenagers face. The whole book is written in the format of letters to an unknown person. Possibly even multiple people.<br /><br />At first, I didn't really like this book. I didn't think it was all that well written. I kept reading it though. I wound up liking it a lot. I found I could even relate to Charlie. I think in a way, a lot of people could relate to him and what he's been through. I think many teenagers should read this book. I think that they may find it helpful in regards to coping.
B00FLDG5BE|1.0|Audio/video sync is way off, making it impossible to watch. It sounds OK if you don't look at it, but what's the purpose of a video if you can't watch it.
B008ALA6DW|3.0|It works, but it is quite difficult to plug and unplug Ethernet cables. It requires a lot of force. It also seems somewhat overpriced, I wish there were non-Apple generics available, because I know they would be cheaper.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book!  I highly recommend it for reading groups.  Great story about a little-known event in American history.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game. But I dislike the cost of the other characters. It has a nice set up. And lots of obstacle to over come. It is totally worth what you pay, if it's not free.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game. Love any thing with castles. Game is fun and addicting. Wish I could move all buildings. But none the less still a joy to play.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Love It very portable, nice design, good sound quality and it's USB powered.<br />Also the combo imput very convenient, and it has the 48V phantom power.
B00C0K6NUY|5.0|I actually read this Katie Maguire before I read the first in the series.  Hard to say more about Graham Masterton, except, if by some strange chance, you have never read his work, then treat yourself to unpredictable, original and satisfying, intellectually stimulating plots, fabulous writing and engaging characters.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I still like the original castleville on Facebook better, but this is a fun game. It is simple, which I like.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|This movie contains sick, dark, perverted, and disgusting content. The fight scenes are good, but the absolute perversion ruined it for me. The disk went quickly into the garbage after the first viewing.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|when you're playing music after a few songs the player locks up at least on a Motorola Droid all the fancy adjustments don't do any good if you can't listen to good music
B004EF65QA|5.0|Love, Love, Love!!! Richard Armitage takes my breath away.  Why did it take me so long to find this movie?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I can't put this game down once I have a full set of lives. It is a great game that keeps you and the kids occupied while in the doctors office. However I would have gave it 5 stars but I don't like how I have to wait 24 hour to finish another &quot;crossing&quot; if I don't connect to Facebook. And it takes 25 minutes to regain each life.. not everyone is on Facebook.
B0000256HE|5.0|I WORE OUT THE 1st ONE & WAS ABLE TO GET THIOS C.D., I AM STILL LOVING THE PINK FLOYD MUSIC
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so cool ,you have many characters to buy and choose. They travel all over the world as if London, Paris, new York and so much more...I would definitely suggest this for your kid!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|YES, I LOVE THIS MOVIE, I BOUGHT IT FOR MY FATHER & MYSELF, IT WAS FILMED AT OLD TUCSON,ARIZONA, WHICH I HAVE SPENT MANY WEEKS AT, I ENJOY JOHN WAYNE MOVIES
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy i can play now, absolutely love this game! waited a long time for it to come out for kindle's .
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book was amazing but due to so many unanswered questions, and due to my having to wait who knows how long to get some answers, this 5 star read only gets 4 stars from me.<br /><br />Honestly I love Sylvia Day's writing style and it was so easy to pick the story back up. Immediately I was caught up in the story of Gideon and Eva and burned through the pages. I have had the book downloaded since it came out but have been putting it off since I knew there were going to be 2 more books, I almost waited. But I didn't and in some ways I'm thrilled since I absolutely love this story and all the characters, but I'm also sad since I now sit here waiting for the next book.
1401938906|5.0|Top of the line for what I was looking for at this time of my awareness! Studied in group form of 10 very ready like-minded people. Thumbs up. This should be your next read.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|every aspect that made the original superman movies so alive and impressive, have been completely done away with, and replaced with transformer like special effects, and a cheap story line.
B000AJIF4E|2.0|Great sound, extremely comfortable and great at blocking external noise. Unfortunately, they lasted less than two years before the padding started to come apart and the left headphone went dead. I expect greater durability for headphones that are this expensive.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Good story and the ability to download a season's worth to my TiVo at will as wanted was a GREAT feature!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Perfect! I don't need and HDMI to micro-HDMI cable and be far from my tablet just because I want to see netflix.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Tremendously brave young girl. This is something that will capture your being for the rest of your life. Be prepared.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Generally, Eben Alexander seems determined to make his near-death memories fit the issues that have troubled his life. If this experience gives him peace, then it's a good thing. But don't call it &#34;science.&#34; It's not that, at all.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|It's Rush, it's brilliant. No more needs to be said-Except for one thing-For some reason, my copy is in a jewel case and not the digipak that every other copy of this album I've seen has been packaged in. You say, &#34;So what?&#34; Well, to a geek like me, that makes it some kind of &#34;One of a kind&#34; thingy. Is it a bootleg? I don't believe so-So, nanapoopoo stick your head in doodoo, mine is in a jewel case.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|I loved this movie, it put me on the edge of my seat. No one could sit and not become afraid during this movie.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is the best calendar app I have ever used. It syncs perfectly with my Google calendar--all of my calendars are updated without having to do anything other than setting the app to update on opening. I'm kind of amazed that Google hasn't put an app out there that does what this one does. One thing to remember though, if you're going to use this as your primary calendar app you have to disable the native calendar app that comes on your device or you will end up with alot of duplicate events on CalenGoo. Other than that there are alot of options to customize it the way you want it. I highly recommend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent acting, story line, props and costumes. Themes are age-old that recur even now. Also, a fascinating glimpse of the days of English Aristocracy. Wish that series came out fifteen years earlier so my Mother could have seen it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Read this. Read &#34;The Name of the Wind&#34; first, and then read this! Masterfully written. I couldn't put it down. Expect to be sleep deprived until you finish. I can not wait until the third book in this series is written and published. I will buy it as soon as it arrives! That  is high praise coming from me. High praise indeed.
0812993292|5.0|This was a selection of our neighborhood book club, and when I read the jacket, I thought--yuck, why are we reading this? Sounds dry and dull--downright dowdy. Wrong, wrong, and wrong. You will fall in love with Harold and his experiences along the way. This book is a powerful reminder that breaking out of the norm is possible ... relationships are mendable ...
B009DH379C|4.0|Fantastic job remastering this film-However, if I had known it was the same show as the &#34;Live Magic&#34; video, with shortened setlist, I may have not bothered-Yes, the sound is superb and the picture is so good it feels like you're there-BUT, they retained the little individual band member segments, Brian May in a balloon, Freddie insulting the servant class, and worst of all John Deacon, who, surprisingly, is a family man, nervously talking to an equally unsure little girl on the street...These sections could have been cut and included as bonus features-Liner notes explain why there is no footage of other songs they did during this show, and that's fine-So for as much work as was put into remastering, it still feels like a rush job. Thankfully, the songs they do show are top-notch performances. I would recommend &#34;Live in Montreal&#34; for a bluray, and &#34;Queen on Fire&#34;, the 1982 show from Milton Keynes for sheer performance quality-Hope they put that on bluray at some point.
0767819659|5.0|My 5-year-old niece and her little sister, age 2, watched this DVD without leaving the sofa. I discovered the movie while channel surfing on TV and immediately ordered it!  The cinematography is wonderful, and the colors and Parisian views  are remarkable. Four adults watched this along with the girls, and we enjoyed it as much as they did.
B0085A9J18|5.0|This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen! I definitely guarantee you will not be disappointed! You should certainly get it!
B001974DG0|5.0|&#34;Watchers&#34; is Dean Koontz's best book, IMHO, and the only one of his books that I have re-read.  Several times.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|I debate whether to get this book. I went back and forth because I've read many self help books and I need HELP! But I read it through and tried each experiment. Apparently some of us need more than 48 hours to experiment. And sometimes no results at all. But while I'm a bit of a skeptic I'm also a man of faith. So I will reread the book, hopefully I get a little more for the second reading.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun! This is more of a challenge than many point and shoot games. I am having a great deal of fun.
B000I5X80G|5.0|A brilliant show from a brilliant songwriter in his heyday-The best Neil Young live album, paired with the &#34;Live at Massey Hall&#34;.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This was the second time I read this book.  It not only is a mystery story, but a story of one of the horrible times in our history.  It is hard to believe, but I know it is true, that there were people like some of the characters in this book. Suspense filled, but very real.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is awesome. I was immediately hooked. I am working to get atom. I feel like I am in the days of the real WRB
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is totally awesome! It mixes temple run and the movie despicable me (which are both great!) And makes them into an addicting, fun and cool game! And it's free! I 100% recommend this game!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|For all of the production and budget ... and star power, it left me flat. There is no connection of the actors to each other or the story.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|Megan Hilty and Katherine McPhee both have fantastic voices.  Some of the story lines are less interesting than others but still an entertaining show.
B008B68IV8|5.0|Brought this for Christmas as a gift for my four year old gra daughter. She will love it as I also purchased the scooter that Ghoulia rides
B008RXYOKY|3.0|Works well, just a bit pricey. Everything from Apple is, so it's not surprising. Great for hooking Firewire drives to a Macbook Air.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The entire series is great! Started only a few days ago and already finished. The third only took two days because I couldn't put it down.
B00D1X0576|1.0|I cannot log in because the app requires some mysterious and cryptic password which does not mach any passwords on my network. I have deleted it from my tablet.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|This is junk. Poor plot, action sequences, story, acting, everything about it is terrible. If it wasn't for the big names, this would be considered a poor, joke of a movie. Trust me, the budget is the only thing big about this trash. Too bad the names will carry it and ensure financial success, but as far as entertainment value ... this is a loser.
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|I put off getting this CD for the longest time. I've enjoyed most of the other albums by The Strokes, particularly the debut, but recent efforts didn't strike me as much. But after playing this new one a few dozen times, I'm hooked. The band sounds very energized on most of these songs, and there are some very strong tunes on here. Lots of hooks and that trademark attitude. Above all. these songs are ones that make me smile and sing. Always a good thing. And the band isn't just sticking to their old fan-tested formula, but trying a few different things this time around. Maybe that will rankle some of the die-hard Strokes fans, but I like what they are doing on this album, Give it a chance and I think you'll be pleasantly --- maybe ecstatically --- surprised.
B008B68IUY|5.0|So totally cute. I hope it performs well as it is a Christmas gift so I haven't opened it yet. I just wish it wasn't specific to one doll.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is fun and I can never stop playing it. They have some of the coolest guns I've ever seen and u get to see all kinds of different animals I bet u have never seen before.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app can`t stop playing it but it might be a little expensive for a app but it`s worth it
B0080BFVPU|5.0|Violently funny movie. Or, a funny violent movie. Either way, if you like John Cusack and dark humor, this is a good flick. An interesting take on a common question - &#34;Did I pick the right career? Am I who I want to be?&#34; Hmm, maybe too deep. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I love this game it I cool fun and you get to play with your frends cool game sind Nick
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a fun game and all, but I really wish it would update a lot quicker. St out 'll fun though.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the best book Grisham has written in years.  The author reunites us with the colorful main characters from an earlier novel entitled &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;.  Having seen the movie &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;, I could vividly picture each main character in Sycamore Row, and it just cleared up character study visually even keener than just reading the book.  It is nice to see Grisham back to the settings which made him famous - Law practiced in a small Mississippi town in the present.  One of his better books and a pleasure to read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The thing that I get trapped is trains<br />'ll<br />That is a shame well I . Really like this game get it for free
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I found myself continually doubting a memoirs if some who appeared to be otherwise so ignorant of the most basic aspects of the PCT.  she didn 't even try on the backpack?  So I assumed most if her stories were created memories.  As fiction I would have found it even more boring.  There is a useful metaphor here however which is what gets it two stars:  we all do extremely stupid things and face difficult journeys throughout our lives .someone who outwardly spends her life writing code or being a sty at home mom may well be as adventurous, foolish and challenged as Strayed.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Nice graphics but not much fun! I do enjoy the game though. My little sister and I enjoy it together
0694517208|4.0|This is a clever book showing some distinct traits that are fairly consistent between the genders.  He also offers some advice, though some of the advice was, in my opinion, pretty weak, such as, write your mate a letter...  If s/he wasn't listening, what makes you think the other would read?  It seemed like a very weak relational tool; might help someone, but to me, not reaching the depth it might need.  All in all, it's a fun paradigm considering the genders are from different planets and good information.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Use almost every day. Setup was a snap and now google play music and Netflix soothe me weary bones daily. Now all my TVs are smart.
B005KR6O58|1.0|The digital copy does not work with iTunes.  A nonsensical error comes up:<br /><br />&#34;This Fox Digital Copy file requires iTunes 7.6 or newer.  Your current version of iTunes is 11.1.3&#34;<br /><br />The move is good, however.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|All the traditional Bond ingredients and super great new twists and effects.  Good story.  Hope for sequel very soon !
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|Huge Def Leppard fan and saw this in theater. Really wanted this for at home too so that I could enjoy it whenever I wanted,
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great game. very addictive glad I downloaded it. wish the energy would restore faster. other than that no complaints about game
1594200823|2.0|The point of the book seems to be that big is bad and cows are happier on a grassy knoll than in a mud valley.  While I am no fan of animal cruelty, determining the happiness of cattle - as if he can know this - seems to me to be a stretch.  The author promotes an idealistic opinion of how the world might function, yet when he sits down for a fine dining experience, I'm fairly confident he would be between dismayed and angry if the restaurant couldn't offer what he wanted and at a price he can afford.  We have some trade-offs in life - for the convenience and economy, we have large food purveyors.  If we go back to each family with its own cows on a hillside, there will no doubt be shortages (of hills and food!)
B000WC39SG|4.0|A BRIDGE TOO FAR is an epic war movie with a star-studded cast and is very good depiction of World War II's Operation Market Garden, the British-led invasion of Holland that was supposed to end the war in Europe early but resulted in the greatest Allied defeat of World War II.<br /><br />My one major complaint about the movie is that it's schizophrenic----even though it was directed by Oscar-winner Richard Attenborough (GANDHI) and was written by Oscar-winner William Goldman (BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN), it comes across as if it were directed and written by two directors and two writers. The British and German parts of the movie are well-acted and well-written but the American parts are, by comparison, inferior in acting and writing.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery, Dirk Bogarde, Maximilian Schell, Hardy Kruger, et al are excellent in portraying the British and German officers, but Ryan O'Neal and Elliot Gould over-act their roles while Robert Redford and James Caan seem bored in playing their roles. The part of the movie involving James Caan saving his officer's life is so poorly depicted that it was singled out by critics as being unbelievable---although it was based on a true incident.<br /><br />Some trivia for the movie includes:<br />1. Some of the British Sherman tanks are real and others are dummy tank bodies mounted on Volkswagen Beetle chassis.<br />2. Composer John Addison was a Sherman tank commander in Operation Market Garden.<br />3. One of Robert Redford's 82nd Airborne paratroopers is John Ratzenberger, better known as Cliff the mailman on CHEERS.<br />4. Two of the actors playing Allied officers IN A BRIDGE TOO FAR later played heroes in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE:<br />In A BRIDGE TOO FAR, Sean Connery played Maj. Gen. Roy Urquhart and in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, Connery played Prof. Henry Jones.<br />IN A BRIDGE TOO FAR, Denholm Elliott played the RAF meteorologist officer, and in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, Elliott played Dr. Marcus Brody.<br />5. Two of the actors playing Allied officers in A BRIDGE TOO FAR later played villains in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE:<br />In A BRIDGE TOO FAR, Michael Byrne played Lt. Col. Giles Vandeleur, and in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, Byrne played SS Col. Ernst Vogel.<br />In A BRIDGE TOO FAR, Paul Maxwell played Maj. Gen. Maxwell Taylor, and in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, he played the head villain who is killed when the freighter blows up.<br />6. Dirk Bogarde's character, Lt. Col. Frederick Browning, was married to writer Daphne du Maurier (THE BIRDS).<br /><br />The Blu-ray version has better video than the dvd version, but it is still below par due to the fact the movie was originally filmed in a somewhat hazy presentation. However, the 2-disc dvd version includes many informative special features including interviews with veterans of Operation Market Garden, the making of the movie, etc. The Blu-ray version's only special feature is the trailer. I have both versions which is  recommended.<br /><br />Overall, A BRIDGE TOO FAR does a very good job of depicting the disaster of Operation Market Garden and a movie with a huge, star-studded cast like A BRIDGE TOO FAR will probably never be seen again, so it is highly recommended.
0679805273|5.0|Perfect graduation gift for any age; I gave these for high school graduation.  I personalized and added comments then included some cash?  Everyone was happy.
B00GRVEDCM|5.0|such a great game I love card games and this is one of the best ive played. anyone who likes card games should get this
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Helps me fall asleep fast, and after a few nights, even my husband is a believer and sleeps better. A nice variety of sounds to choose from to find your perfect relaxation combination. Highly recommend.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I am really pleased with this game! Like a side scrolling minecrafty fun time even on a first generation kindle fire. Legalize it sweet baby because it is woo collude.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome<br /><br />great book can't wait to read the next<br />I hope it's just as great as the first
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|I received the book and the CD.  Both arrived promptly and in good shape.  I liked the CD.  But, the book  was much better.  The book had a boring start, but was well worth your time to continue reading.
B00DZJ82TY|5.0|Perfect album.  Not one mediocre song.  It SOUNDS like a classic. The extra tracks are interesting, but he clearly chose the right versions.  Every one plays on a loop inside my head.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a really cool game and super fun for everybody of all ages!! best kids game and sooooo cute
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another powerful story by a masterful storyteller!  I lived it right beside the characters!  No one tells it like Mr. Grisham, and I'm so glad he bought Jake back. Not legalese, but a story of people of the south. No story line from me; I wouldn't spoil it for you. If you've never read a Grisham, you must read this one!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this book in two days, couldn't put it down. Skipped out on a night of sleep. It never gets boring, every page has something new to offer. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is pretty fun and time consuming. I have one complaint is how many crowns you need to spend to get extra items. One costs money but if you want another of the same building then you have to pay crowns. That stinks!!
B00GINENG0|5.0|I downloaded Tom for my nephews four year old to play and I loved it as well. Fun to see Tom as he grows.
B001MCXLW4|5.0|For me a newly discovered classic.  What an amazing assemblage of talents!  These guys weren't wannabes.  They were seriously the real deal.  The interplay between the individual musicians, all great in their own right, is wonderful.
B00005NZBN|5.0|a classic. bob dylans output over the last 15 years has been remarkable. this is an absolute must have. good music.
0553565915|5.0|I was delighted with the condition of this book and it's speedy delivery...darn good reading too.  I enjoyed this book very much.  Her descriptions of her experience gave me much comfort in contemplating my own death.  Excellent book and good service.  Would definitely use this seller again.  I was thrilled with the information contained in this particular book.  I guess I just can't say enough about this book.  This is the best NDE I have ever read.  So detailed in it's beautiful description, it was pure joy reading it.  I happened to see an interview with Betty Eadie and the look in her eyes as she described her experience would make a believer in even the most hardened atheist!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After everything I have heard about this book I was so surprised to be so drawn in to the characters and the story like I was...I didn't want it to end! Now I have to get the next book!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I didn't understand that I could not project my amazon prime movies form my computer to my tv with this device.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|i actually bought this movie for a class, we had to write a paper on it. turns out, this is a great movie. (it has ryan gosling, of course it's great!)
B00ESB75FA|3.0|I'll watch it bleed out, but if this were the first season of a show, I'd never watch season 2.
B008OW1SAC|5.0|album of the year. end of story. a must have. drifty dreamy intense light fun textured ethereal unlike anything else.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Terrific cast and funny, funny, funny take off of space TV and space movies.  Great for a gathering of good friends' evening of entertainment.
B00E3VTR1K|1.0|I've always counted my time as being far more important than the few bucks we spend on ebooks. This book, or what I read of it (the first three stories) were a complete waste of my time. I only got this book because it had such high reviews, which are completely baffling to me. I didn't read all the stories. I read the first one, and was disappointed by the overly simplistic writing style and the way the concepts were handled. Then I read the second one, which was so utterly forgettable that I can't recall anything about it now, and finally I moved on to the prison story with my rapidly dwindling  hopes, but that was the lamest one of all. Maybe it's me, but I found these stories dull and pointless. Absolutely pointless. I'm still mad about how much time I wasted on this book. While I was reading it, I didn't look forward to my breaks at work like I do with most other books. This book was just so incredibly boring and I couldn't feel a connection with any of the characters. I have taken the unprecedented step-- for me, anyway-- of deleting Galactic Energies from my kindle and my kindle library.<br /><br />My apologies to the author-- I'm sorry for disliking your book so much. I have written and posted this negative review for the benefit of other readers. I wish there had been a review like this to warn me. All those (in my opinion) undeserved five star reviews raised my expectations to the point where I was extremely disappointed with the reality.
0812550706|5.0|Great book!  I read it as a kid and wanted to read it again before I saw the movie.  Great read and the price was great!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love this show. I like the relationship between the characters. The main characters have been what holds this show together.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Getting ridiculous speed with this compared to wireless....be sure to get it when you get a MacBook Pro or one with retina display!
B000GRTQSE|5.0|another late dylan masterpiece. its remarkable how many great albums he has and that he can still put out seriously high quality stuff.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love history. Most of us have come from these beginnings and understanding them is important. The book and those to included in this period of time kept me engaged.
B005M5PENG|5.0|Love the characters, the bromance and the romance.  This is all in the context of people who risk their lives every day to keep the world and those who cannot protect themselves  . . . Good story lines, loyalty, love and family.  I never miss it.  AND THE SCENERY . . . absolutely beautiful visions of everything makes Hawaii a paradise.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game may have a childish theme but it is difficult. The only complaint is that it is set up so they can get you to buy extra lives. It is hard to win some of these and you spend a lot of lives to move. Also more explanation of combinations would be nice but then you might win and not be tempted to spend real money.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|This show gets better and better every year. The main characters keep this show from being too seriously grizzly and watchable.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|In a word, Michelle Williams was fantastic! She emotes Marilyn Monroe to the core. She is so a talented actress.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is my first reading by John Grisham. I could not put this book down. I really recommend purchasing this book.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I love history. This book kept me engaged and helped me understand the events of the time. Different and more depictive than the movie.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like this game much better than the other runner type games as it is somewhat easier to control what the runner does.  I am not as good at this game as others probably are, but I like it anyway.  However, I am NOT HAPPY that I got stuck in Beijing and couldn't get out! (That is a big part of the low star rating.  Why can't we have it do a MANUAL UPDATE if the game doesn't do it automatically??) Finally, after almost 3 months of being there, I had to remove the game from my system and reinstall it.  So, now I have lost ALL my scores, progress, and etc., and I have to start over. But, at least I have moved on to Christmas/winter in London.<br /><br />I missed getting to go to Moscow and New Orleans, but  I also missed other places that were before I got the game.  Too bad it doesn't let you start at the beginning and keep going through all of the places in order, but then the seasons would be at the wrong times. Or, it could let you pick where you wanted to go next.  Do people down under have to be running in winter scenes when it is summer there now??<br /><br />Overall, I like the game, but I hope it doesn't get stuck again later.  If it does, I might give up on it.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This app is so much fun! I think you should get this app. Tom or Zack (my cat ) is so funny. AND THE BEST THING, IT'S FREE!!!!
B0053O89IS|5.0|This is a great show and has a great romance running in the background at all times. The sexual tension is perfect, balanced with the humor.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I like this movie, it is a symbolic step forward for Disney's inclusion of an African-American princess. I would have preferred that she spent less time as a frog and actually found an African-American prince. Love is love but ancestry is so beautiful and it does matter. Clearly kids and adults are heavily influenced by the images they see. I think it is great to see more beautiful African-American couples loving and respecting each other even if it is in an animated film. Also, as a Louisiana native, some of the stereotypes were a little tired but funny so I can live with them.
140006922X|5.0|Zealot makes you think about religions 2000 years ago and how vastly different life and religion was then compared to now.  Whether you're Jewish, Christian, Muslim, etc., you begin to realize the vast transformation each religion had to undergo,
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love history. This sequel is very interesting to me. I love being taken back in time to better understand where we came from
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Best series of TV that has ever been produced.  He's the best.  She's the best.  Saul is the best.  You can thank me later.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|It took me a while to figure out what was going on. This story is kind of vague in spots. Very creepy, but good at the end.
0375703861|5.0|Loved the characters and bawdiness, also presented a culture I'm not at all familiar with, Archie's attempted suicide was hilarious and I know that sounds dysfunctional - until you read it
B003O86FMW|5.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />We pick up six months after Katniss and Peeta have been declared victors in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.  Katniss has been living in the Victors Village, but has clearly suffered some PTSD from all that she has experienced. They are set to go out on a mandatory victory tour through all the districts.  President Snow tells her that he knows about her and Gale and her lies about the relationship with Peeta.<br /><br />He says that she needs to help stop the violence and dissention in the districts on her grand tour.  While away from home, we see how things in Panem have changed now that the 99% see hope and change for the bigger community.  Now that hope is burning in the 99%, they are willing to rise up and fight the Capitol for change.  District 12 also sees a violent change with new Peacekeepers and a more stringent enforcement of totalitarian rules.<br /><br />It is decreed that the 75th Hunger Games will have previous victors being chosen to represent all districts this year, the Quarter Quell.  Katniss and Peeta compete in a tropical forest, gaining allies and enemies along the way.  At the end of the games, we are told a bit about Katniss' district as well as District 13.<br /><br />This book shows what happens in the after picture when someone has been sent away and done hard stuff to survive.  A person may return home but there is always changes which are sure to occur.  One can certainly relate to how experiences can change a person's self, both positively and negatively.
0811874192|5.0|An amazing popup book...5 different arrangements to choose from.  I used this as a&#34; Thinking of You&#34; rather than a real flower arrangement.  It's designed to stay open on a table and can be quickly changed to another selection..
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Very well acted movie an d well structured story.  Some action and lots of suspense.  Could not have been better.
1416972250|5.0|Bought this for my Granddaughter so I only know that she loves the Author and has read a number of other booik by her.  She is happy with it.
B00EVW04PE|3.0|This movie was fun, but pretty ridiculous. My husband felt he had wasted an hour and a half (or however long it was), but I enjoyed it.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Long-time DT fan here. Overall I'm pleased with this album, but I wouldn't rate it at the top. Notably it has more of an epic power metal feel than previous albums. Personally I enjoy that a lot, but it's not for everyone. I think this album is a strong showing and has some great songs and sweet riffs, but I think it falls short in a couple areas.<br /><br />First, I think one or two songs are a little weaker than the rest. To clarify, MOST albums I own and love share this same characteristic if not more severe. I don't mean this as a general negative as much as a &#34;this album isn't perfect&#34; (see Scenes From a Memory for a strong album start to finish).<br /><br />Second, I find that this album has some really amazing intros (most notably the intro to the album -- False Awakening Suite), but for some reason the endings just don't do it for me. I wish I could express the reason in words, but I can't figure it out. Two endings seem like they're supposed to be really strong: The Bigger Picture and Illumination Theory. Bigger Picture leaves me feeling wanting and Illumination just seems to go on too long. I like to compare this to two DT songs with very strong endings that always leave me with chills at the end: [Scenes From a Memory] Finally Free and [Systematic Chaos] In the Presence of Enemies Pt 2. Again I'm not sure what the difference is. Maybe it will grow on me.<br /><br />Now that we've got the negatives out of the way, let's talk about some positives. This album is awesome! I really dig the power metal style, and there are some little unique gems in particular that I always look forward to. Myung has some delightful bass moments which is great to hear. In fact the whole band just plays incredible, as expected.<br /><br />One more comment I have is about Illumination Theory itself. This song reminds me somewhat of Count of Tuscany from Black Clouds and Silver Linings. It has a strong start, followed by some weird heaven/space interlude, a melodic part, and then more fun. I'm guessing the band discussed whether to break up these epic songs into separate tracks and decided not to. If the band is listening, I would *beg* you to consider doing so. Count of Tuscany became one of my favorite songs on Black Clouds, but every time I listen to it I have to sit through the space interlude to get to the rest of the pie. Illumination Theory has the same problem. I definitely do NOT skip through anything on a first listen, and I understand those interludes are important, but on subsequent listens, especially when we're talking like 30th+, I would rather just be able to skip the abstract artistic part of the song to get to the meat I want. The melodic part in Illumination is absolutely beautiful, but most times I just want to get to that sweet bass action and the rest of the song.<br /><br />Final conclusion: get this album if you like good music
B006WZLCZ4|2.0|The bowl to spoon fell off a few months after my son started playing with this.  It looks like the bowl of the spoon was glued to the handle and it just popped off - you can see the seam in most of the pictures that advertise this toy.  My son still loves all of the other pieces to this toy.  He loves to make me breakfast and give me tastes as he's cooking and then serve breakfast.  I love Hape products and I love the design of this toy, but I'm very disappointed that the spoon is broken.
B007EC27QM|2.0|This looks nice and works well, but it's slow! It has a delay when&nbsp;first&nbsp;opened and it lags on calculations. It also has occasional pop-ups nagging to rate the app. These are just as annoying as having ads. There's better, faster calculators for free. This one is nothing special beyond looking decent.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't tell you in words how addictive this game is but it's commonly referred to as &quot;Candy Crack&quot; amongst my many friends &amp; acquaintances. I'm on level 207 now &amp; if there's a level 1000 I'll still be playing to make it there. Best game Ever. Highly recommended...
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun and love the graphics. Easy, too hard to earn diamonds, etc. All in all, one of my faves to play.
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|This movie touches my heart - a definite classic I can't wait to share with my kids. A must-see Christmas movie!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm enjoying this book, and savoring every page. I'm a long time Stephen King fan and this book is right on his mark. I have a Kindle which is a great, low cost way, to get new releases. It's also a good compact size for reading on the plane when I travel.
B00FEN000S|5.0|My husband's favorite (silly) movie of the year. I like Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Ron Perlman, Guillermo del Toro, and silly movies too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A Great Story.  Action packed and full of surprise puzzles.  Ender tolerates so much and then succeeds where all others fail.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I love time travel.  I love JFK books.  I thought I had found the perfect combination of both.  I read this very long book all the way through, expecting it to really get good, to give me a memorable, dramatic resolution.  After all, this is Stephen King, right?<br /><br />This book is basically Stephen King's own fantasy version of what it would have been like if he had lived in the early 60's and actually used his teaching certificate, found a girlfriend and love, and been a hero to a whole town.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, there was that &#34;Kennedy thing.&#34;<br /><br />What a disappointment.  If it had been a self-published author, trying to make a name for himself, I might have given another star or two for effort, but I came in to this book expecting something by the &#34;Master.&#34;<br /><br />The only thing this book has that his others have is lots of obscenity and some somewhat perverted sex scenes that really did not add to the story.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addicting and fun one of the best bingo games out there definately one of my favorite versions of the game
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A perfect sequel to &#34; A Time to Kill&#34;.  This is by far, for me, the best John Grisham book ever written;  do yourself a favor & pick it up today; You will love it
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|With great humor and magnificent writing the author tells us how to leave a much better life and, eventually, find happiness. It's a recipe for getting life right. Funny, smart and very useful.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was a great book, and the movie didn't disappoint my expectations. The actors and actresses that were chosen for the movie fit the characters very well. They are close to what I had been imagining when I read the novel. The way the story is slightly altered because it isn't being told in the first person, and lacks the internal dialogue of the book. However these alterations do not damage the story, I find they compliment what you find in the book very well.
B008XG1X18|4.0|So I love this app, and spend probably way to much time on it. But I just downloaded the update and now it won't open. It just goes to a black screen and says app won't open, and then it closes. Really wish I wouldn't have updated.
1742204147|5.0|A caveat: I haven't been to Japan yet to test this one in the field, so I can't speak to this guide's accuracy. But having examined it from the comfort of home, I can say that it has whetted my appetite to visit Japan and has made me feel a little more sure of myself about doing so.<br /><br />Obviously it's impossible to reduce a country to an 870-page guidebook, but I feel that Lonely Planet has done a good job of selecting material that will appeal to and be of use to novice travelers to Japan.<br /><br />This has the usual sections--where to stay, where to eat, what to see--and a 25-page &#34;survival guide&#34; at the end which, I think, I'd find useful. It appears to be full of information that a traveler would find quite useful (again, having not been there yet, I can't attest to its actual utility) and has plenty of maps. If/when I go to Japan, this guide is definitely coming with me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun game. You can feed your horse and play with it too. I suggest this game to animal lovers or if your mom won't get you a pony for Christmas. Lol :p
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good Ol' Grisham style.  Very enjoyable, the characters were amusing, and rich.  One of his better story lines. Time well spent.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this app is amazing i get all my music from it. you can get all your favorite songs and it automatically downloads it for free!!!! i recomend it 100%
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I chose this rating because of the great characters and the way Ms. Donna Tartt can construct such<br />very dense glorious sentences so full of meaning.  ...and, as an artist,  the presence of the<br />mystery surrounding the painting!  Great book!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This is the type of Spielberg movie I enjoy. Along the lines of a scary ET. JJ Abrams and Steven are a powerful combination of suspense and thril in sci-fi. Check the reviews for small children. Adults and teens will love it.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I wish other authors could write theirs novels without all the f words & swear words like he does .
B008UU90Y4|5.0|A picture that my wife and I have watched several times. The acting is great.The sound is beautiful,the picture quality is top notch.
1582701709|5.0|exactly as described, This was for my husband who heard about this from a friend and i wasnt really interested but found the book very interesting.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I have to say that the first 21% of the book had me confused. Sort of like when I read something written in the early 1900s. Then you start to figure out that you might find things out much in the way North Koreans must feel in the dark and surprised. And you also figure out there some things you won't find out either and you get that disturbed feeling of not knowing-- again like the actual North Koreans might feel as it relates to where some of their loved ones go. North Korea is interesting nest of political propaganda. So glad I was not born there.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The nature of sacrifice is delivered in these books. I have never seen the struggle we all face with who we are so well-written.
B001HN690O|5.0|I thought it was as good as the first one. Jack Black cracks me up. You know some of those lines are impromptu. Good for kids and adults. A little scary near the end with dark dragon ships but you can check the reviews for children. I liked it and will watch it multiple times.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Was boring most of the way through and then felt let down and many ways.  Was so excited with the first two books.  Was hoping to feel renewed by where this was going and instead felt the dreariness of the conclusion.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|this game entertained me for literally hours car rides waiting rooms you name it it's awesome it's so cool playing with a lifelike Thompson.
0596522347|5.0|This is very comprehensive book. Well organized and thorough. I'm not an artist an need so inspiration for design in my PowerPoint presentations. This book as been a good guide for my needs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so super fun and so much better than temple run you should get this awesome game you won't regret it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the adaptation between book and screen. Even without the books, this movie could stand on its own and still be good. Not a huge fan of some casting decisions, but overall well done by the actors.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|It was a pleasant paced, interesting read about one woman's experience in the Bush following the Aboriginal way of life. Whether or not it's all true, you decide.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good third book in the trilogy. Yes, the sexy scenes are great....but the best part is getting into the psyche of Christian....and seeing what makes him act like he does.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like this game, I wish it was a bit easier to earn city credits. Quite addictive, worth trying.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is super cool for my lazy-boy setup. I use this on my left arm rest and i have a 1/2in binder on my right arm rest with a weight and a notebook in side to make it stable so when i move my mouse around it does not move. Anyway I finally completed the full logitech gaming setup with the g19 keyboard, g35 headset, g500 mouse, and now the g13. My first order was great but the PI# some how was messing with the g35 headset when the headset was transmitting noise to the ears. I spend 2.5 hours on the phone with logitech before they decided it was a code problem kinda like 2 ip address trying to run on the same network at the same time. Anyway after getting the 2nd one everything seems to check out just fine and now someone else can get my open box perfect g13 that can work with other g35 headsets(just not mine cause of my PI#), also the 1st g13 worked with my other 8 sound devices playing noise and when using the microphone.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|What a tremendous story... though I knew of the terrible tragedy this day was all the people of this part of the world, I had no idea of it's scope... also, I had no idea that there were folks like this family involved, being on vacation and all.  The acting was superb as well as the story line.  I have watched it twice already.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Perfect game for wasting time. Make sure to link with Facebook though or you won't get very far. Wish the game tracked amount of time played. Well over level 200 and I'm sure I have several days worth of &quot;played&quot; time.
0375842209|5.0|I read this book from my local library and thoroughly enjoyed it so much I wanted to share it with my very special niece who is a social worker.  She enjoyed it as well and shared it with her mother.  She recently learned the book has been made into a movie and has extended an invitation to view it together. (We live 200 miles apart.) Nothing like a good book to bring family together.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|THIS IS A VERY FAST PACED MOVIE, WITH EXCELLENT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND AN INTERESTING STORY.  I LIKE THE<br />CAST IN THIS NEW STAR TREK SERIES, IF FACT I LIKE THEM BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL EXCEPT UHURA AND<br />SCOTTY: I MISS UHURA (ORIGINAL BEAUTY) AND SCOTTYS FUNNY REMARKS (WHERE THERE BE NO TRIBBLE ATALL)BUT<br />THE NEW ONES ARE OK.  HOW EVER I DON'T MISS SHATNER WHO TRIED TO MAKE THE SERIES ALL ABOUT HIMSELF.<br />THERES EVEN A TRIBBLE IN ONE SCENE, HOW NICE!  BUT THE NEW KIRK AND SPOCK REALLY WORK WELL.  THERE ARE<br />SOME INCONSISTANTSEES IN THE NEW SERIES: THERE IS NOTHING IN THE EARLIER SERIES TO SUGGEST KIRK AND<br />SPOCK EVER HEARD OF KHAN BEFORE THEY MET IN THE TV  SERIES.  SPOCKS MOTHER WAS KILLED WHEN VULCAN<br />WAS DESTROYED, BUT QUITE ALIVE AND WELL IN THE 1960S SERIES.  AND VULCAN WAS STILL THERE THEN,  PERHAPS<br />A FUTURE MOVIE MAY EXPLAIN THIS.  I GIVE FOUR STARS INSTEAD OF FIVE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE UNANSWERED<br />QUESTIONS .  OTHER WISE A VERY GOOD ENTERTAINING MOVIE.
B008LODRT8|2.0|The trilogy 50 Shades of Grey could have been quite a poor short story if all the gratuitous sex had been eliminated.
B00GIY5OGC|5.0|Cute kids movie and not too bad for the adults to watch during family movie night either! I loved that Snoop Dogg was one of the snails!
B00GH4R95C|2.0|Sometimes the action and special effects are just simply too much.  I felt like I was watching a 2 hour trailer.  Though there was a story, and it was good, I guess I have just outgrown all the &#34;eye-candy,&#34;  I like something with a little more depth.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Great game in all but when trying to purchase the zombie expansion pack it will say haveing problems downloading it will email me when it is done. Well ive waited a week now and i have seen no sign of my purchase!! Until i can get my expansion i rate 4 stars!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game what took you so long to bring it back?<br />This is the best game on my kindle fire.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book kept my interest. It tells of a terrible, sad time in our history, one we should neither ignore or bury.
0345803493|2.0|50 Shades of Grey could have been quite a poor short story if all the gratuitous six had been eliminated.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|i needed new wiring for my kindle fire and so i ordered this per recommendation. price was tolerable and i received them in a day or so.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|While Jamie Foxx isn't the most convincing President I've seen, he and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry that helps to move the plot forward.  While it's similar to another movie I've seen about the taking down of the White House, this movie is different enough to set it apart.  I highly recommend this very entertaining movie.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|Love Aerosmith and this is a great video of them and their music.  They just rock the world and Japan.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|I was so excited for this film and the wait was so long, so I was expecting a lot! And it does accomplish that and many more things. \\"Catching Fire\\", the second film on the Hunger Games movie series proves that the wait is worth it! The movie is really loyal to the book, which is hard to find nowadays (almost half of the things that happen before the Games are deleted, but most of them aren't really important so I didn't care), but it's a great adaptation. Even some lines are exactly the same. The performances are awesome too; Jennifer shows her talent again, Josh and the rest of the cast were great too. I thought that the actors they picked for the new characters were great, you don't think \\"I think he/she was the wrong person for the character\\", everyone embodies their character so well! The special effects and the little details are awesome, the audience gets to see that this time Lionsgate really believed on the film, so you can get to see awesome effects and even a little bit of gore.<br />I thought this film was one of the ones you enjoy from the beginning until the end, it's a 146 minutes rollercoaster of emotions, action and drama with a little bit of love. \\"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\\" really deserves all the success it's getting! Can't wait for Mockingjay Part I. I know this movie isn't Oscar material, but Jennifer really deserves a nomination, she's exceptional.
