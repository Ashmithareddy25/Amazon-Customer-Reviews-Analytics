6305558167|4.0|This movie pleased me up front with it's photography then music.<br /><br />It brought to the forefront the concept of desire. Desires can either enslave us or liberate us. That is the human experience and many times we fail, but redemption is always in our grasp. Later in the movie with the charge, the trees were blossoming, the music by Carl Orff was heroic, it was almost too much. We frail humans are so capable of triumph over the tempting tranquility of defeat. A well done film. Nicol Williamson was great with his shuddering voice of Merlin.
B000669GAI|4.0|I'll have to admit something: I'm not a huge Pearl Jam fan. In fact, I used to dislike them for a long time. But then I finally heard stuff back from \\"Ten\\" and enjoyed that, and while I can tolerate most of their albums, there's nothing that really makes me want to listen the whole way through, though a few moments come close. Don't get me wrong: I have nothing but respect for PJ. Even though its fans can be pompous and self-righteous. <br /> <br />It covers 33 songs, and probably every one you're familiar with, as well as ones you may not be. My favorites on here are \\"Immortality,\\" \\"rearviewmirror,\\" \\"Do the Evolution,\\" and of course, \\"Black.\\" There are quite a bit of really good songs on the album. I guess I can see why people enjoy them, although on album I feel that they perhaps take themselves too seriously, and have the overall impression that the mid-90's stuff gets a bit pretentious. The lyrics are usually great as well, and they are talented, even if its fans overestimate it. <br /> <br />There are a few tracks I dislike, however. I always have thought \\"Even Flow\\" was awful, partially because of the annoying way Vedder presents his vocals and uninteresting chord progression. \\"Better Man\\" is a boring and sub-par track and not even close to one of the better moments on \\"Vitalogy.\\" \\"Who You Are\\" is a bit too hippy-ish for my tastes and I don't care to decipher the lyrics. I always thought \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" was too self-indulgent and bland to really do anything for me, in spite the fact that it also gets a lot of airplay still. <br /> <br />However, the good definitely outweighs the bad here, and I think it works well for casual/fairweather fans like myself. It was interesting to hear the new remixes of the \\"Ten\\" songs, and hear \\"Once\\" begin with the actual song. I don't even feel the need to listen to a lot of the albums as often because of the feeling that a lot of the best stuff is on here.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|Wow - I was sooo disappointed by this movie. People that normally have the same taste as me highly recommended this movie. I kept waiting for the good parts. As mentioned in a few other reviews, there were a couple laughs, but not enough to purchase the movie. I honestly can't imagine this being good for a little kid to watch either (way too much adult language and sexual commentary by grandpa and not enough little kid interest).  <br /> <br />The whole premise was also a little contrived, as it was supposed to be a big surprise that these 6 year olds were creepy looking in their makeup etc. However, with all of the Jon-Benet publicity a few years back, I think everyone in the US knows that these little girl pageants are just wrong. The unbelievability of it all just added to the slow story. <br /> <br />Get Ice Age 2 instead. <br />
B000002IG4|4.0|This is a very good CD from Phil, I think, being a great fan of him. There are some very serious but also one hilarious number on it. Serious like \\"Do You Know And Do You Care\\" and \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" and hilarious is \\"Like China\\". It is about Phil loving a girl but her family doesn't agree with the relationship. He brings it on quite funny though. He sings: \\"I promise not to hurt you, I'll hold you like china\\" <br /> <br />Very good! Thank you Phil! <br />
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Great album! It is a live recording of new songs from John Mayer. While he is usually a poppish composer, this album is a blues masterpiece, with incredible dynamic and a great sound wall coming from just a trio! It never gets boring or predictable. Gotta have it!
B000022TSY|1.0|This movie is offensive in the same way that any movie that is truly about hippies would have to be. What that meens is this movie does not consist of the typical slapstick hippie stereo type that we usually get in stupid cartoons. This shows hippies for what they are, degenerates, and at the same time it demonizes the south. For a hippie, this movie would seem to be a moral statement, but to me it just seems to show how awful people can be. Shame on hippies for being , lazy, pot smoking, anti-establishment degenerates. But shame on the south too, for being filled with such hatred. But while I'm sure there are some people in the south that would have no problem shooting hipppies on spot for no apparent reason other than that they looked funny, I can't help but feel that the south were exagerated to certain extent. In conclusion though, this movie was enjoyable . I don't know why, but it was. I guess its just a very amusing look into the late 60s (something thats usually sugarcoated)from the \\"other side\\" lol. i would like to rate it higher, but I just can't bring myself to do it.    P.S. That hippie commune was kind of sad. The adults were running around actin irresponsible while the kids were just generally unhappy without any real parent figures.
0618680004|1.0|First of all, I am an atheist, raised by atheist parents, and had researched, to the best of my ability, Christianity as a teen, and was never even slightly convinced by any of its arguments. I then promptly forgot about it, until recent events brought religion to the superficial forefront of world news once again, albeit this time a different one. In the mean time, however, a lot of my hostility towards religion dissipated and the world grew less black and white.    Reading Dawkins' book now, I am embarrassed that this self-proclaimed ambassador for atheists everywhere still clings to the childish ideas that I once held, and mixes them with some very knee-deep intellectualism afforded him by the environment of his prestigious university, which, judging by this book, he does not deserve to inhabit.    It would be nearly impossible to enumerate the flaws of this book. From the chronic lack of depth in his analysis, Dawkins' focus on the largely enlightened (and declining) Christendom, his attempts to attack an inherently emotional and irrational topic with \\"logical\\" (sadly not first-order) arguments, his anticlimactic jabs at everything held sacred by anyone, and obvious and often expressed frustration that priests still haven't been put against the wall for their crimes against humanity (such as, perhaps, giving people hope), his historical revisionism (Religion is behind all wars?). Dawkins has now with the consistency of a solipsist refused to acknowledge that people might like (and benefit from) spirituality (delusion, if you will) beyond simply his \\"look at the stars and marvel at the complexity of the universe\\". Not everyone can do that Dr. Dawkins, much like you seemingly can't write an insightful book about religion. Even though the oft repeated scientist mantra \\"we don't know everything, but that's no reason to take up superstition\\" is featured in this book, Dawkins, apparently failing to emphatise with the religious mind, does not make a convincing appeal.What good points he makes in his book could be summed up in a paragraph, which, to spare you the money that you could better use to treat yourself with a Reader's Digest, is exactly what I shall do: Most importantly, Dawkins writes that we should stop associating to children their parents' religion, because, he points out, it is the same as associating to them any other ideology. When was the last time you heard of a \\"communist child\\"? I agree completely; children are not old enough to make informed decisions on their choice of delusions, and parents should not force theirs upon them. There were also some jokes which made me chuckle, but, like it is with jokes, I've forgotten them.    Unfortunately, Dawkins' stupefying book persists.

B000LC55F2|1.0|If you have seen this movie, then run, don't walk to a theatre near you to see a far superior film: The Illusionist! It will help get your mind off this mess of a film. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen The Prestige, then be aware that the film has little to nothing to do with magic or magicians. This is a period piece about revenge in all its grotesque glory. There are no redeeming social values to be discovered nor any morality at all. <br /> <br />In addition the film defames the brilliant Nikola Tesla! <br /> <br />The performances are well crafted by the actors, but the script is so weak, at times confusing, and so narrow in scope that one loses interest in who wins or loses.

B000JSI7BM|3.0|I watched this disc on a PS3 on my Mitsubishi 65\\" HDTV via Component cable at 1080i.  This is nice looking Blu-ray disc.  I thought the colors were right on and the blacks looks good with no trace of artifacts.  I didn't realized how pasty white Anne Hathaway was, but that is a good thing as it just shows how good a transfer this is.  The audio is good and the music in the shows sounds great, however I found it difficult to hear some of the dialog and found myself asking my wife, \\"What did she say?\\" several times. As for features, there are some deleted scenes we tried to watch but didn't find interesting.  We liked the gag reel and we really liked the pop up trivia track.  It has all sorts of interesting production notes, trivia, etc.    In all this is a solid release and worth consideration.  I only give it three stars because, this movie is for my wife and if she were writing this it would be 5 stars, but for me that knocks a star off.  Also this MPEG-2 transfer does not stand up the the best VC1 transfers on HD DVD and plus it is an expensive disc, so for me another star off.  However, HD is the way to own this release and I recommend it.
0609610570|3.0|This books builds on the fame of the authors, but tells nothing more than a series of banal truths. For the one looking for execution techniques, this book will not give any new insight. On the other side, a manager that will miss one of the \\"pillars\\" here presented, i.e. the people process, the strategy and the operation, or to establish the link between them, will inevitably fail in the longer term. The book is easy to read, and might be useful for beginners to avoid banal mistakes.
B000KF0NHU|5.0|I have to say, the more I see this film the more I enjoy it.  It is a very good movie and this HD DVD is an excellent presentation.  Being a combo disc, it is a little more expensive than the Blu-Ray version but you do get  full Dobly TrueHD sound and the ability to take the disc with you in the minivan, which makes it worth the extra few bucks.  I have a PS3 for Blu-ray playback and a Toshiba HD-XA2 for HD DVD playback both feeding to a 60\\" Sony XBR2 HDTV at 1080p. In this setup this disc look amazing!!!!  This if really one of the true reference discs for HD DVD.  There are NO flaws with this transfer, this really a good reference disc that you can show off what HD DVD can do. It is in a word, amazing!!!  Like I said before this is a combo disc, you can compare the HD quality vs standard DVD quality by just flipping the disc.  My kids love being able to take the movie in the mini-van.  Also, with a good audio setup this disc sounds amazing.  The mix is alive and eveloping and just makes the movie that more enjoyable.  If your looking for a good disc to show off that new HD DVD player, give this a try you won't be disappointed.
0679746323|5.0|Chang and Halliday's remarkable biography of Mao has been criticized as biased, unscholarly, flawed in various ways, and even written in English that is stunted, too peppered with crudities, and too casual to be taken seriously. Good. The work is imperfect, infected with bias and written in a prose that is simple and a bit eccentric. But, who writes a biography that is not biased and what biographer's prose is perfect? McCullough's hagiography of Adams, Manchester's MacArthur, and the recently popular tome, Ellis's \\"His Excellency, George Washington,\\" are all biased works that gloss over problematical character flaws, omit or obscure facts, and present their subjects in a glowing light. McCullough goes even farther, diminishing such marvelous characters as Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson and even Benjamin Franklin in order to present Adams as greater, stronger and wiser than they. Excess and bias have been part of biographical work since Plutarch (and probably before him).  It's part of the unavoidable baggage of the genre. <br /> <br />That being said, Chang and Halliday's \\"Mao,\\" is one good read. I couldn't put it down, and friends and co-workers who borrowed the book were similarly affected. It had a special resonance with me, since I had been eager to learn something of Mao but found that the books on him were either obvious Maoist propaganda or too lean on post-war details. There were also the many mysteries (to me) that surrounded Mao, none of which were made clear by the avaiable literature, which invariably contained  repetitions of obvious exaggerations and lies about him and his leadership.  <br /> <br />My first bio of Mao was a short study I read in high school, contained in a book called \\"Portraits of Power.\\" It faithfully repeated the official story of the Great March, embellished with the astonishing claim that during the March, Mao managed to collect specimens of flora and fauna then write a book on the biology of Western China. It described how Mao's forces, completely enveloped by the KuoMinTang, managed to slip through \\"disguised as peasants,\\" escape, and reform. There was even a brief mention of the fierce fight at the Luding Bridge. Even at the age of 15, I found much of this to be incredible. Either Chiang Kai Shek was the most incompetent military commander in modern history or some other forces were at play. As for the bridge, I wanted more details, so I turned to Snow. Snow's story of Communist forces fighting their way across the burning decking on an ancient chain bridge, the chains red hot, but the diehard Communists throwing hand grenade after hand grenade, was just too much.  It still is. Anyone who has had any military experience knows well enough that such an assaut, if not impossible, borders on the miraculous. A narrow bridge (Luding is about 6 feet wide, if that, with no cover for any assaulting troops) can be indefinitely held by a small force. Even Napoleon - in era of single shot weapons - was unsuccessful assaulting a bridge protected by an inferior force of Austrians. I've always thought the official story of the Luding Bridge was utter nonsense. I was delighted to find that at least one set of authors - Chang and Halliday - agreed. <br /> <br />The authors have been accused of representing their opinions as facts. This just isn't so. When they speculate, they freely admit it, then prop up their speculations with facts and, in some cases, eyewitness testimony. Is any of this unimpeachable? No, of course not.  One can't prove that Chiang let Mao escape, but there is every indication that he did. Other explanations aren't very satisfactory, and the Chinese Communists, who might be able to shed light on the events, do not open their records and files to review.  <br /> <br />Chang and Halliday have also been criticized for presenting a flat, one-sided portrait of Mao, whom others complain was a complex character, not just an evil mannequin. Far from it, Chang and Halliday show Mao as complex and self-contradictory as any character in history. They go to great pains to discuss his voracious reading habits, his love for Chinese opera and for the stage, and they include many details, such as the bed he had with a built-in bookcase, constructed especially for reading. They admit he had a kind of charm that could lure and persuade people, and was well read in the Chinese classics.  What is all this, however, when the indisputable facts of his ruthlessness, cruelty, general misanthropy, and enormous capacity for gross self indulgence so overwhelm whatever pretensions to culture and civility he claimed?  A rounded vision of Mao does nothing to mitigate his crimes. It is this very reading and sensitivity to music that puts him in relief and makes him even more the monster. Had he been just a lout and a bully, he would have been understandable, but he possessed some learning and culture and this just makes his ruthlessness and taste for murder and terror all the more awful.  <br /> <br />Chang and Halliday have also been criticized for not going further into the depredations and atrocities of the KMT. The book was about Mao, however, not about the KMT. Solzhenitsyn wrote damningly of Stalin, but paid scant attention to Hitler. Was he supposed to invoke other tyrants and despots to compare their crimes to Stalin's? Are Chang and Halliday similarly responsible for cataloging Chiang's murders and corruption? Do those crimes somehow excuse Mao's? Mao was a big enough topic. Chiang's warts have been well exposed by others.  <br /> <br />Chang, especially, has been criticized for hating Mao. Anyone who has read her \\"Wild Swans\\" and learned of the horrid experiences her family endured during the Cultural Revolution can understand why. Her hatred for Mao, however, does not exonerate him or his apologists, nor does it call into dispute the factual material she reports. One may disagree with her interpretation of events, but there is nothing of substance that is indisputably incorrect.  Mao was utterly loathsome. Every aspect of his personal life was bizarre and perverse from his personal hygiene to his collection of nurse-concubines, to his \\"longevity program\\" in which he demanded a teenage virgin be brought to his bed every night. He called for murders and executions, engaged the entire country in a mad, destructive effort to produce steel from pots, pans and scraps, ruined agricultural production and caused a famine (this is without dispute, only the numbers dead are disputed - one million or 30 million - low figure or high, it was still horrible), exported food as people starved, built up then ruined the public education system, burnt books, encouraged gangs who harassed and punished teachers, tried to destroy the country's cultural inheritance, tore down historic buildings and monuments, suppressed science, persecuted the veteran Communists who had brought about his victory,  and tried to supplant Western medicine with the \\"great storehouse of Chinese medicine.\\" <br /> <br />But what of the good he did? We're told by his apologists that he united China. Despots are uniters, aren't they? Hitler could be said to have united Western Europe, at least for a time. Stalin united the countries of the Soviet Union, and later those of Eastern Europe. Tito united Yugoslavia, and Saddam united Iraq. Is being a \\"uniter\\" enough to justify the rest? We're also told he thwarted foreign occupation or control of any part of China, but did he?  Colonization was well on the wane by 1949. Japan was in ruins. Britain had given up India. The Dutch had released Indonesia. The United States had provided the Philippines with its independence, and the zeitgeist of the post war world, led by the United States, was to free colonies. No one wanted a piece of China any more. We're told that lifespan and literacy increased under Mao. Perhaps so; perhaps not. Communists were not scrupulous in maintaining accurate records. If literacy and lifespan did increase,Mao had little to do with it. Peace has its dividends, including longer life and better education. After 20 years of better schooling, Mao disrupted everything with the Cultural Revolution and set China back, especially Chinese science and industry. It was only with his death and the arrest of the Gang of Four that China came right once more and began to progress rapidly. <br /> <br />Finally, Chang and Halliday have been criticized because the book, which is titled \\"The Unknown Story,\\" doesn't seem to contain that much new information. This is utterly silly. Yes, there is some puffery in the title (they are trying to sell the book, not deliver it as one more unread collection of pages to academic libraries), but certainly their access to Soviet records, their many interviews, and their extensive research did turn up things and cause speculation that would not have occurred otherwise.  This is seen in the theory that Chiang, fearing for his son, who was in the Soviet Union, let Mao escape under Stalin's orders, or in the shocking revelation that Mao, in one of his more despicable manifestations, had himself carried on a litter during the Great March, while he callously let other, lesser comrades suffer and die.  The book contains much more. <br /> <br />Chang and Halliday's book is a great read, and a great start in purging the world of Maoism.  If it contains some flaws, then so be it. Its flaws are minor. They disappear when compared to the offal produced by the Chinese propaganda machine. Chang and Halliday's speculative and controversial assertions at least make more rudimentary sense than other work on the same topic. Buy the book and keep it. I doubt it will be surpassed soon.    <br />
0441003257|4.0|When I started reading this book, I suspected that it would rank in the 2-3 star range.  I thought it started too slow and did not seem to be going anywhere.  With rumors that it could be made into a movie, I could understand why the rumors did not come to fruition.  Dominated by Pratchett witticisms, it is difficult to see Neil Gaiman's part in this.  I never felt far from Discworld.  Yet when the plot finally started rolling in the last 200 pages, I found the book hard to put down. <br /> <br />When you are responsible for initiating Armageddon, the key is to keep track of the Antichrist.  Yet when the whereabouts of the Antichrist become unknown, starting the apocolypse becomes much more difficult.  With a collection of incompetant demons and angels, the book is hard to take seriously.  Yet the incompetence is a major factor in the story and it is what creates the humorous scenarios. <br /> <br />The best character of the Discworld series is Death.  Death makes perhaps the best cameo in the book in his familiar role.  Other characters such as the Sisters of the Chattering Order of St. Beryl, witchhunter Newton Pulsifer, and Crowly are certain to delight Pratchett fans. <br /> <br />I think they are ways that this book could have been better.  It takes too long to get going in an interesting direction.  Also, because there are so many characters, some are never fully developed. Aside from these complaints, the book was an enjoyable experience.

B000002ACR|5.0|This, the fourth album from the Byrds, is often regarded as their strongest. This is mostly a matter of taste and opinion, but considering that most Byrds albums are great and near-masterpieces, it's not really that interesting if a particular is hailed as the best, the second best or third best.<br /><br />This is a great album and an intersting one in several respects. For the first time the Byrds made an album without contributions from their original main-songwriter, Gene Clark. Clark had already left the band after the second album, but he is actually featured on \\"Fifth Dimension\\" as song-writer and possibly also playing on some tracks.<br /><br />His absence gave place for a very interesting rise of bass-player Chris Hillman, who suddenly became the most prolific song-writer of the Byrds. Contributing four first-class songs, and four co-written with McGuinn ( 2 of them bonus-tracks ) his importance on his album obviously is immense.<br /><br />\\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" was even chosen as a single, and though it did not fare very well (#74), it's one among many standouts on the album. Great guitars and vocals. \\"Time Between\\" is just as strong, and interestingly featuring future Byrd-member Clarence White on his easily recognizeable guitar. He's also featured on the short but nice \\"The Girl With No Name\\"<br /><br />On the Beatles inspired \\"Thoughts and Words\\" McGuinn delivers some great psychedelic guitar-licks. Hilmann sing lead on his own songs and Crosby is delivering some breathtaking high pitch harmony vocals.<br /><br />David Crosby is also showing strengths as a song-writer. Whereas Hillman's songs are mostly up-beat, Crosby's are mid-tempo or ballads. Strongest songs here from Crosby are \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" and \\"Renaissance Fair\\" ( co-written with McGuinn). He also delivers the album only miss, the atonal time-piece \\"Mind Gardens\\".<br /><br />Vocally usual lead-vocalist Roger McGuinn is up-front on the hit-singles ( #29 & #30 ) \\"So You Want to Be a Rock'n Roll Star\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"My Back Pages\\". Both great tracks; the former a satirical comment to the music-industry and the latter is classic Byrds with 12-strings and out-standing vocals.<br /><br />The bonus-track are mostly nice additions. Crosby's \\"It Happens Each Day\\" would have been a nice swop for the weak \\"Mind Gardens\\".<br /><br />The rare B-side \\"Don't Make Waves\\" is interesting though unsignificant. The other B-side \\"Old John Robertson\\" is much better. An different version was included on the band's next album \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\".<br /><br />Crosby's flop A-side \\"Lady Friend\\" does not really sound like anything the Byrds recorded before. Big, slightly chaotic production. Some fans consider the song an over-looked masterpiece. At any rate, the album as a whole is one the greatest and most important records that was released in 1967.ant to Be a Rock'n Roll Star\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"My Back Pages\\".

B000K4WPCC|5.0|This movie was along the lines of Underworld 1 & 2. It had a lot of action, decent storyline, some really hot characters, & at times it even had a little spook to it. But it really was a fun movie. My husband is really picky with what he likes & he loved it too. It really held my interest the whole time. I definitely disagree with everyone who gave this movie bad reviews. I think sometimes people have too high of expectations for movies. Then when it turns out to not be like what we imagined your disappointed. You just gotta sit, watch, relax, & have fun. This movie deserves like 3 stars just for the how hot the cast was. That was enough fun to look at.

When I 1st listened to this album, I was absolutely shocked!  1 Magazine review said \\"it's the most mainstream NIN album to date\\" and that's pretty accurate.  The songs on the album that are actually woth listening to... sound like Trent was doing everything possible to make sure they'd be worthy of POP Radio Stations, rather than Rock Stations!  And, the other songs, well, worse than Filler Tracks. <br /> <br />As if that weren't bad enough (yes, it gets worse)... almost none of this album even resembles NIN music.  There's little to no synths in a lot of the songs, the guitars & basses are so heavy & so intermingled - you can't even make out a lot of the tunes --- it just sounds like garbled noise --- not music, let alone NIN quality music.  Worse still, it's literally ALL OVER THE PLACE in most of the songs... with tremendous & abrupt halts & reverses in tempo & style (grinding guitar noise 3 min. into a song, then in a split second it's nothing but slow & quiet piano) -- and the Singing is the same. <br /> <br />Because I'm such a fan... I reluctantly held my tongue this long while... but after listening to the album again a couple days ago (after listening to the others) I just couldn't take it any longer & had to speak up!! <br /> <br />IF you're a completionist like me, not only do you have to buy this album, but undoubtedly, you have at least 3 different versions (along w/ all the singles, promos, etc.)  BUT, if you're NOT - stay far, far away from this album... and for the most part, stay away from \\"The Fragile\\" too... unless you like the softer side of Industrial (that CD is mostly crap too -- but still 100 times better than this... and at least has it's moments!)  Stick w/ the Classics - Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, Downward Spiral. <br /> <br />Since I just mentioned \\"The Fragile\\" -- am I the only one who's noticed the STEADY DECLINE of NIN over the past decade??  Many people called that album his \\"Masterpiece\\" or \\"Musical Masterpiece\\" -- well, maybe musically it was... but there's more to NIN music than just the music... LYRICS are a Major part as well... and that Album was lacking in direction as well (still nowhere near as bad as With Teeth by any means) <br /> <br />I just don't get it... NIN Live - is a magical thing... they even managed to take the songs from The Fragile & bumb them up a notch... for some reason, they just can't capture that magic in the Studio anymore... and now, they can't even write anymore.  Hopefully this was just some kind of \\"Experimental Album\\" -- and they'll get back to, well, being & sounding like them... next time...... we can only hope that is! <br /> <br />Please, for the love of God - don't let them become the next Metallica!!!

0441172717|5.0|This is one of those rare books that changes every time I re-read it. Perhaps the most interesting thing about it is that it takes place in a futuristic, sci fi setting but involves no computers. Although the underlying meanings and political subtelties went over my head the first time I read this, Paul's basic revenge story was more than enough to keep me occupied. The characters (particularly the Baron and the Bene Gesserit) were memorable and uniquely original. <br /> <br />The heroes (with one or two exceptions) are not genetically or accidentally gifted with thier powers. They grow slowly, out of painful and careful work and sacrifice, making them both undeniably human and strikeingly different from most other heroes in other sci fi books. <br /> <br />A classic.
B00079FUI6|3.0|It's a good show and a good set, although the featurettes are a bit cloying, and it'd be nice to be able to skip past the long, annoying intro to the main menu.  One warning, however, if you haven't already watched the whole first season, DO NOT watch the featurettes on the first disc.  One of them gives away major spoilers about the season finale that will ruin the suspense building through the entire season.  So: good show, seriously problematic DVD design.
B000F8O35U|5.0|A great movie for kids and grown ups. Fun to watch for the whole family.
B000002L9J|5.0|I used to listen \\"quietly\\" to The Smiths in high school and college.  It wasn't that I was going to be beaten up for this, but no one that I knew in high school or college used to listen to them.  Everyone would always mock Saint Morrissey, saying his lyrics were whiny, miserable, and he was just a plain old wussy.  Please!  The lyrics are sad at times, but they're also hilariously dark in an English sort of way.  The song Frankly, Mr. Shankly is one of Morrissey's best lyrics EVER, and it's one of Johnny Marr's best melodies ever.  The Queen Is Dead is also the same way, and the song ends with a wicked guitar lick by Marr.  It sounds almost like he's playing the slide guitar, and considering how creative he was, it wouldn't surprise me if he snuck in a slide guitar to his playing.  Cemetary Gates has great lyrics about being your own person, which to me is a rather positive message.  And how can you not love a song called Vicar in a Tutu?<br /><br />This is an album that I play quite often and sing (or vocalize, I can't really sing) with.  One remarkable thing about The Smiths is that despite being from the 1980's, their songs don't date.  They are one of the greatest (and most misunderstood) bands of the 80's.  They are in their own unique universe, and this is my favorite album of theirs.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I am not a Star Wars fan but thought I would give this a go, and was surprised to find I actaully quite liked it. The storyline is slow at times, the acting is certainly not great (even with Liam Neeson), but the special effects are simply brilliant. Most people seem to be disappointed by this movie probably because they are Star Wars fans from way back and maybe this movie didn't live up to their expectataions, but I was most impressed and will probably get the second installment now and work my way right through to number 6.<br />Basically, this is a good introduction for all non Star Wars fans, so I would advise to give it a go, you may be surprised to find you actaully like it.
B000002UDG|5.0|My Mo brought this cd home one day for me to listen to.  Since she knew I was becoming such a huge Beatles fan.  Ever since it has been one of my fave cd's.  The songs are catchy and fun!  I listen to it all the time.
B000EYK4KI|3.0|When I sat down to watch this film at home, i put on my romantic comedy hat for a nice evening.  But as the story progressed, I had to put on my spy hat, adventure cap, my drama hat and eventually my sonics hat.  This movie has it all!  Not to spoil it...but Mr. and Mrs. Smith are really Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.<br />I did feel, that the movie was lacking in a strong political stance.  I mean...where does this movie stand on current issues?  This is imporatant to me, and it was not covered.  3 stars and no more.
B00004RFFS|1.0|Interesting concept, bad execution. Not recomended. There are better films out there about vampires. Not a good film.
B000HBKCDC|1.0|I love Sarah McLachlan, but half of the songs on this cd are not even written by her.  They are basically old Christmas songs.  I am shocked that no on else has noticed this.  She copies someone and sells a million albums, I copy ONE SONG and get a big fat F in my beginning piano composition class.  If this is what the pros are doing, why are we being punished in school?  Another round of applause for the public school system...no thanks, write your own songs Sarah...I have to.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I pre-ordered this DVD for my wife. It arrived on time and as advertised. Perfect condition. <br /> <br />The special features were wonderful. We both grew up with The Little Mermaid, and it was great to sit together and watch this special edition and bring back some memories, build some new ones, and see some of the behind the scenes secrets.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00003W8NM|2.0|So, my basic thing is that this movie left you hanging in all kinds of ways...how did the fight club organize itself.  How were policies and rules determined, did everyone just listen to brad pitt whenever he talked?  That seems a bit unrealistic, was there a treasurer, how did they pay for club events, or advertise?<br />In all fairness, however, obviously this is about more then just the club, and the fighting was really cool.
B00008J2IQ|3.0|I had volume 1 for years and then discovered volume 2. I had high hope that volume 2 would be as good as volume 1.  Alas this was not to be.  It's a good CD but lacks the honesty and gritiness of volume 1.  It's to commercial, the music is not as intersting.
B000E8N690|5.0|I was very impressed with the quality of this DVD and the short time it took to receive it.
0393327655|4.0|Harris takes sharp jabs at organized religion, especially Islam, Christianity and Judaism. He singles out the Bible and Koran, paying special attention to the harshly worded sections that fuel extremism. Most of Harris's arguments rely on logic and rhetoric. As such this book is not as informative for readers wanting a historical discussion of religion.<br /><br />Still, Mr. Harris clearly has spent loads of time thinking through issues of faith, especially the link between faith and violence. The book is an excellent intellectual exercise, even if you disagree with what he says.<br /><br />Harris's book includes long endnotes that showcase the depth of his research. They also offer supplemental examples of his primary claim that faith is a self-destructive ingredient in life. However, the end notes often amount to overstatement. And if the content of these extensive end notes is so compelling, one should ask why they didn't make it into text.
0312323867|5.0|I wasn't expecting anything special from this book, but to my suprise it was just as good as the first book, maybe even better.
0790734850|5.0|This film is undoubtedly one of the tops from the 1990s and certainly the best from 1997.  The cast is impeccable.  How can you beat Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, James Cromwell, Graham Beckell, David Straithhorn, and Danny DeVito?  The story is well told, and the viewer's interest seldom lags.  Mind hammering special effects are nil (thankfully), and the audience is led along by the nose in a tantalizing way.  There are really no dead spots in this movie, just a great storyline and superb acting. Also, throw political correctness out the window, which is another reason why this film is so original, entertaining and intriguing. Who really shines above and beyond?  Nobody.  Everyone shines!  Yeah.  It's that good.  This film raises the bar and will remain a tough act to follow.  Unfortunately, Hollywood is afraid to make too many of these films.  Why?  Because tinsel town wants to fashion the world into its only little mold instead of reporting events the way they really are.
B000HCO840|5.0|There's not very much to say if you don't like what the X Men brigade have done so far don't purchase this DVD. If you are among the ones that complain that the saga doesn't follow the comix, don't purchase this DVD. <br />If you are a big kid affected with Peter Pan complex like me. GO FOR IT ! <br />Hunt it down until there are copies available. This movie it's not less spectacular and wonderfully produced as the previous 2. <br />i got this version because here in Italy the edition with the comics it's not available... or maybe it is but I'm sure it wouldn't be so cheap like here on Amazon... anyway, just get it, it's all worth it.
0930289234|4.0|Watchman is not your average graphic novel. Just a quick flick would reveal that you are not looking through the pages of any DC or Marvel adventure. When you get into it the stories are more like reading a television soap that has just had a shot of high-octane masked heroism. Alan Moore's tale of burnt out superheroes, finds itself pitted against the backdrop of the 80s cold war crises, is deservingly recommended to all graphic novel lovers, yet it is genre defining, doing away with conventional good guys versus bad guys, for a `life is rough and everybody pays' kind of theme. Here the characters are fully fleshed out with some disturbing tales of sexual deviance, murder, revenge and capitalism. By developing and digging ever deeper into the characters psyche against a backdrop of a looming atomic war threat Moore's men are brimming with imagination. The size of the book means you will be chugging through for some time to come. I had it for weeks. The chapter breaks include many lengthy essays so this is probably the reason for it. Recommended with a cherry on top for graphic novel lovers, although unconventional here means that Watchmen is not really the best graphic novel to start with and is more for experienced tastes.
B00003BDXG|4.0|It's easy to pan Natural Born Killers for being what it is in the hands of Oliver Stone, but underneath the psychedelic, trippy vision and graphic ultra-violence lies a direct middle finger to the American media.  Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are Mickey and Mallory Knox: two sociopathic killers who are nothing more than products of their environments.  They go on a cross country murder spree and become instant celebrities for their crimes, which eventually takes them to prison and results in a cataclysmic prison riot that will leave you stunned.  There's more going on than just that brief assessment, as Stone overhauls original writer Quentin Tarantino's (who dismissed Stone's adaptation) script to focus on a media obsessed with violence.  His message doesn't always come across clearly, but it's there nevertheless.  Harrelson is mesmerizing, Lewis is quite good as well, but it's the supporting cast that steals the show.  Robert Downey, Jr. in particular as a Geraldo Rivera-spoofing media vampire who will go to any lengths for ratings is worth the price of admission alone, as is Tommy Lee Jones as a vulgar yet hilarious warden, Tom Sizemore as a very bad detective, and the late, great Rodney Dangerfield as Mallory's abusive father.  Hard to watch, yes.  Worth seeing if you've never dived into it?  Absolutely.  The DVD itself features Stone's director's cut, with some added scenes (mostly bloody), but there are some deleted scenes which fans of the film will eat up, including Ashley Judd's never seen courtroom scene, and sardonic comedian Denis Leary being himself, along with a shocker alternate ending.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I'm glad Warner Brothers finally authorize Richard Donner to release his original version of Superman II because if he hadn't realeased it. I would have never known about the big controversy that Richard Donner and Marlon Brando had with the Salkinds producers. Ever since I watched Superman the movie when I was a child I always wanted to see Marlon Brando in Superman II even if it was for a few minutes, but thanks to Richard Lester all the audience, and viewers saw was Marlon Brando's hands picking up the crystals at the intro of his version of Superman II. The scenes with Marlon Brando talking with Christopher Reeve on Superman II The Donner Cut, was way better than the scenes that Lester had recorded with Susanah York talking with Christopher Reeve on The Lester version of Superman II. I always tought that Superman II was pretty weak in the plot, and characters compared with Superman the movie even tough I noticed that the majority of the people liked it because he got to fight 3 Super villains!!!!! At least on the Donner version the audience can see that Richard Donner had a much serious view of the Kryptonians villains compared to Richard Lester which rerecorded alot of scenes with the villains doing dumb and stupid things like when Non tried to use his X-ray vision to burn the snake at the first time on earth, and when the 3 Kryptonians invaded Metropolis the scene that the people of Metropolis tought that they had killed Superman with the school bus, and went out to beat the crap out of the villains, so they started blowing wind on the people, and you can see the dumb and stupid scenes when a guy is talking on the phone booth and the booth ends up being destroyed by the wind, and he's still talking on the phone, and also the part that the man is holding an icecream, and the icecream flies to the face of the other guy standing next to him because of the wind that was blowing hard. Therefore this movie I recommend for anyone that is a Superman fan, and like myself liked to see Marlon Brando in Superman II to continue with the relationship of father and son like Richard Donner intended for his viewers.      <br />
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|I have waited 12 years for this film to be made, ever since I first read the novel in 1994. While I love the ideas of the novel(s) and have seen evidence of how synchronicity and coincidences have played out in my life, the writing style left a lot to be desired. It was elementary at best. I've always felt that \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" would work much better as a film, giving us visuals of the various energies that surround us. <br /> <br />Writer James Redfield probably followed his internal hunches in not selling his novel to major Hollywood studios, knowing how well they can mess up a movie of this kind of spiritual importance. However, after I had watched this film, a part of me wondered if having a major Hollywood studio finance the film with a talented director might have made this a much better film. As is, it is fairly good, but not out of the ballpark great. I don't know what exactly it's missing, but something is not quite right for me. Perhaps it's a bit too talky and not enough action, with the final plot resolution coming a bit too quickly and unrealistically. The explosion scene came off a bit too cheesy. <br /> <br />All that aside, because I am hungry for more films of spiritual content to be made, I support all the film projects coming out that are based on spiritual books I've read or heard about. Along with this film, I saw \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" (the best of the bunch), \\"Conversations With God\\" (not as good as \\"Celestine Prophecy\\"), and I even include \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" in this category of spiritual films, as we are supposedly in the age of \\"the apocalypse\\" in which information once hidden by power-elites in churches and governments is being unveiled for all to see, know and understand. If anyone wonders why the sudden increase in spiritual films, well, Nostradamus himself foresaw the 21st Century as the age of spiritual awakening. <br /> <br />The central idea of \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" is one that is sure to rile up all those fundamentalist Christians who put bumper stickers on their cars claiming that they will be \\"raptured\\" when the time comes. According to the ideas in \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\", the \\"rapture\\" has little to do with being obedient to church doctrine and/or leaders, but is an active process of one's spiritual development. I've had moments of pure bliss in the past, with such intensity that I thought my body would explode from the power of the spiritual love I felt. However, it is very exhausting to sustain that level of energy, especially if surrounded by the negative energy of others. The scene in this film perfectly demonstrates where that level of energy will take human beings. So, to all the fundamentalists who think obedience leads to rapture, spirituality is not for lazy people waiting around for a messiah to come. And one can't \\"rapture\\" one's body if one is too busy hating other people and trying to convert them to right-wing religions. Only by seeing the connections between human beings, paying attention to the synchronistic flow in one's life, and following those hunches to where they lead...only then can one begin to realize the depth of authentic spirituality. <br /> <br />So, despite the film's flaws of being independently financed with at times flat acting and cheesy special effects, it is a worthy accomplishment and a film we need to support...especially if we hope to see the sequels \\"The Tenth Insight\\" and \\"The Secret of Shambhala\\" made into films. And rumour has it that \\"the 12th insight\\" is awaiting to be revealed. Buying this dvd will help support a worthy cause: the small but growing spiritual film industry.
B0000640VO|4.0|This movie is an excellent pic if your'e looking for a foreign film. It's very funny,upbeat,and the character Amelie is a unique one. From the start of the movie you can see how crazy her life will be, because her parents are extremely eccentric. Throughout the movie Amelie meets and decieves many clever characters, and it is all done very well. I recommend this to any one and everyone, it is one of the best foreign films I've seen.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|I play it all the time.  Some of the song I thought was Beyonce after buying this CD I relized it was Rihanna all along.  She sounds like Beyonce when she sings.
B000002LND|5.0|This is truly Madonna's greatest hits. All her best from the past are on here, and there isn't a track that I don't love. The highlight songs on this album are Material Girl, La Isla Bonita, and Like A Prayer. If you love Madonna, you must own this album. I hope that she comes out with another CD like this, but with her hits from the current years.
B00005JPCA|4.0|Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has revealed some early details on \\"Casino Royale\\" which stars Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Judi Dench, and Jeffrey Wright.<br /><br />  The two-disc collector's edition will include a Becoming Bond documentary that takes an intimate look at how Daniel Craig stepped into the role of the 6th James Bond, a James Bond: For Real featurette that looks at the action and stunts, a Bond Girls are Forever featurette that takes a closer look at Bond's leading ladies, a Death in Venice featurtte, and the Chris Cornell `You Know My Name' music video. The film itself will receive an anamorphic widescreen presentation, and English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track.
B000KX0HVY|1.0|Just a few years ago, \\"Elvis: 30 #1 Hits\\" was released on CD. It contains roughly the same number of tracks as \\"Essential Elvis\\" does, and most of the tracks here are available on that compilation. <br /> <br />There have been very, very many Elvis \\"best-ofs\\" released over the past few decades - some available through stores, others often available through infomercials by companies licensing the music.  <br /> <br />I guess my point is this: they're re-releasing this stuff every other year because they know they can milk Elvis' back catalog for all its worth and people will keep on buying. I work at an album store and the day of release I had numerous requests for this. Meanwhile, Elvis: 30 #1 Hits is still just as good. <br /> <br />If you don't have any Elvis Best-Ofs, this is a worthy purchase. If you own any, though, I wouldn't say it's worth dishing out for again. I really wish they'd stop re-releasing greatest hits compilations a million times for Elvis, because it's getting ridiculous.
B0000509C4|5.0|The original Creepshow was a landmark in horror film history,(did I review that one yet?) and the second installment only adds to the glory of the first. It had 3 stories instead of 5 like the first one, but that's probably because they are longer tales. When I look back at the history of horror films, this one is always one of the firstor should i say second that I think of. This is a must have for any collector or film lover.<br /><br />One last thing... Thanks for the ride, lady!
B000HCO83G|3.0|While the effects and cinematography was very good, I thought to much of the story line was put into this movie.  I know some people were offended that characters appear out of sequence and such, but this is Hollywood after all, so that was less a bother to me.   <br /> <br />I think Kelsey Grammar did an awesome job with the voice of Beast and that the animation/effects guys maxed him out.  I was disappointed to see Collosus be relegated to such a insignificant role.  Oh well!   <br /> <br />Overall, good; but not as good as the first two!
0790744295|5.0|Sometime after doing my review of Creepshow 2 did I realize I didn't review the original. And not wanting to disappoint my (2) fans, I have decide to put the disk back in, and give you my in depth opinion...George A. Romero(\\"Dawn of the Dead\\",\\" Day of the Dead\\",\\" Martin\\")after huge success with \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" directed his another masterpiece-an anthology of five short stories called \\"Creepshow\\". The script was written by Stephen King, and the special effects were made by F/X wizard Tom Savini(\\"Martin\\",\\"Maniac\\",\\"The Prowler\\"). The first story \\"Father's Day\\" is so-so-nothing special, but the zombie looks terrific; the second story \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verril\\" is the funniest, Stephen King steals the show as a Jordy,a goofy farmer, who finds a strange meteor; the third story \\"Something To Tide You Over\\" is my favorite-it's ghastly, creepy, funny and a little bit disturbing, again great make-up of the drowned zombies; the fourth story \\"The Crate\\" is the longest and goriest-there's a lot of suspense and plenty of gore mixed with black humour.Finally we are getting to the last story \\"Creeping Up On You\\"-an enjoyable story about cockroaches with some rather gross special effects. Overall I must say that I love \\"Creepshow\\"-surely they don't make them like this anymore. So, check it out! In fact, I will hold my breath as you do. Because I can hold my breath for a long, long time.
B000K4WPCC|2.0|WHOA!THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY CORNY! ONLY ONE PERSON GETS KILLED IN THIS MOVIE, DO I HEAR BOO ANYONE! THE WHOLE FIGHT SEQUENCE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE WAS REALLY LAME! ALL THEY HAD WAS THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS THOWRING INVISIBLE ENERGY BALLS AT EACH OTHER LIKE THEY WERE PLAYING THE OLD 1992 HIT VIDEO GAME (STREET FIGHTER 2). THE SO CALLED MAGIC IN THIS MOVIE KINDA REMINDED YOU OF THE MOVIE (THE CRAFT). JUST LIKE ONE OF MY FELLOW REVIEWERS SAID, IT WAS A LOT OF MALE BONDING IN THIS FLICK! BUT TO THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS FILM,DON'T FEEL BAD,THE SO CALLED VILLAN DID NOT DIE,SO THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A SEQUEL!
B000HCO83G|5.0|Its a great movie, everything is excellent from the story to the actual shooting of the film. Good actors too.
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm not gonna lie.  Bono could sell me ice in Antarctica.  I find his lyrics extremely emotional and moving.  I call this album My Gospel.  I've read a lot of reviews suggesting the lead singer should get off his soap box and the group as a whole should try something new.  I don't agree.  U2 works because they are what they are.<br /><br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is full of powerful words and amazing melodies.  The only thing better than Bono and his song writing skills in this particular album is The Edge and the way he sets those words to music.  The man has true talent.  So does the band.  This album just proves it - once again.  I loved it.
B000HCO840|5.0|I thought it was just great lot of acton a must see if you like X-MEN
B000286S8S|5.0|To bad sammy left because of this idea, but still great collection.
B00000JG41|5.0|Wow! Thats about the best I can put it. This is the first Mr. Bungle album I bought and it was a hell of an adventure from the beginning to end. It takes a special group to be able to take different styles of music from the whole spectrum and make it flow like that. My favorite song is probably the last one. From the Arabic vocal patterns to the Heavy Metal thrash, it was a blast to listen to. Anybody who's looking for a blend of music with no limits, Mr. Bungle is the way to go. Like many other reviewers have mentioned before, this one is the most accessible CD they put out, and I mean that in the most relative sense.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is an excellent set of songs.  Some are upbeat, some are haunting.  All seem familiar, yet also very fresh by using odd-bar blues and non-standard tempos.  The lyrics are witty, raw, and lovely wrapped within the singers well-worn, crackly voice.  The band follows easily and loosely, yet never misses a beat.  An album I've enjoyed many, many times while stranded in traffic, and falling to sleep to at night.
0694003611|5.0|This is one of the best books out for children.  Great bedtime book, and the illustrator creatively made it appear darker and darker as bedtime approaches.  My girls say night-night to the bunny every night.  Love the book!
B000K4WPCC|3.0|I would recommand The Covenant for the following reasons: good CGI, hot topless guys, and good battles. This film is in a similar genre as Underworld, but it doesn't have that much horror element, and the lack star power. It's still worthwhile visually even if the story is not that interesting. It would have have been better if the film made more effort towards being scarier.
0761119752|5.0|Another of my girl's favorites!  Cute little rhyming bedtime book.  Especially love \\"Pajammy to the left, Pajammy to the right...\\".  TOO CUTE!
B000F0UV0E|4.0|I love the two voice blends.  This CD grew on me - not my favorite but the two Artists are excellent together.  The Songwriting is not the best from both of them but the blend of their styles is really interesting and a beauitful blend.  I hope they will do more together. You can't Beat Emmy Lou and Mark as Artists.
B00005JP9V|5.0|In particular, a young woman, pretty, and marked by her face as an outsider in a country that cages outsiders like cattle. The child, in particular, is hers. It's also the first human baby born in nearly twenty years, since some unstated catastrophe ended every human pregnancy - and stopped every other pregnancy since, except hers. She's so young that she never even saw a baby, except in pictures, and now she has one. The only one.<br /><br />But the world around her has gone to hell, or maybe become a hell. \\"After the fall\\" movies have been around for a long time: Soylent Green, Hurt's 1984, Bladerunner, and many others, always fallen just a bit farther than the one before. Now we have Children of Men. Skies are stained with smoke, streets are littered since no one cares, and the government ration boxes include suicide kits - the ones advertised on subsidized TV. It's just too believable.<br /><br />I can't say there's a real plot to this movie. It's a small kind of quest, maybe just a trek through concentration camps, buildings burning in urban combat, and scorched earth. Michael Caine puts in a superb performance, since he doesn't know how to do anything else. This time, he's an aging hippie, but also a very brave and pacifist combatant in that war that seems to have no reason, and something even braver for his wife. Claire-Hope Ashitey, an emerging star, plays the young mother (or new Eve) with quiet beauty and charm. The rest of the movie doesn't conspicuously manipulate our feelings until the end, but we want it by then.<br /><br />I'm still not quite sure what to make of this movie, or even whether I want to see it again. I came away impressed, though, and moved in ways that I don't have good words for.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the best I have heard of in a long time. I have owned it for more than a year and I am still finding enjoyment and new songs that I start to like more and more. It is an incredible cast, and the song lyrics themselves are exceptional. A MUST for everyone!

032147404X|4.0|Like several other reviewers, I find the author's attempts at humor to be mildly annoying. But having said that, this book is still well worth reading and good value for money, particularly for the novice to intermediate Nikon or Canon DSLR user.  <br />The book is simple and easy to read with a number of very worthwhile tips on a wide variety of digital photographic issues.  <br />Just remember the tips and forget the humor.

0783230370|5.0|This documentary follows 2 years in the life of a brave scientist, Dr. Alex Hesse who is willing to sacrifice his own time, health, and life to answer the question that has boggled the minds of men since the dawn of time; Is it possible for men to bear children, and if so, are they better at doing it then women or simply different. While its obvious throughout the film that the male body is not designed for the carrying of a child, Dr. Hesse does it with a grace and without complaining (at least that is shown). The film is powerful and magical
B00008GKEG|3.0|This five-disc set, as you might expect, has a lot of material on it.  Which is good.  But.  The problem is that a lot of the material -- arguably the majority? -- really has no reason to be here.  A lot of it is boring, and a lot of it is repetitive.  You will hear and see the same songs performed multiple times on each disc, which frankly gets a bit tedious. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of good material to be found on these discs, but it's just too far apart.  I think they could have made a really solid two- or three-disc set out of this material by paring it down a bit.
1582701709|5.0|Where do I start...I got the book after seeing it on \\"Ellen\\", I read at least a chapter every morning while drinking  <br />my morning coffee.  While I do I let the spirit of book and it message (to be positive about all things) start my day.  I can tell you, I haven't had a bad day yet and the little things that usually bother me have become tiny at best.  I don't know about the \\"miracles\\", I am still trying to teach myslef to change my thoughts from negative to positive, but I can tell you that its free to try and why not, I loose nothing and can gain everything.  For those of you who wrote such negative things about the book,,,I think you missed the whole point.  I wish you the best. <br /> I'll be sending this book to the people I love who may benefit from its message.  On each copy I will attach a note saying that I want them to read it with an open heart and open mind, then drive it around the block a few times, kick the tires and THEN decide if it works for them.  I recommend the same for everyone else.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The Little Mermaid, was such a big favorite of me and my sister when we were little.  Sadly I loaned my copy to a favorite teacher of mine and never got it back, and of course it was out of print for a gazillion years.  Now it is back in print, and my sister gave it to me for Christmas.  Based on the Hans Christian Andersen folktale and written by Howard Ashman and Allan Menken LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, this story is about a 16 year old mermaid name Ariel, who doesn't like living under the sea.  Much to the chagrin of ther father King Triton, she falls in love with a human Prince Eric, and gets the sea witch Ursala to put a spell on her.  Well, Ursala tries to marry Eric.  Will Ariel's friends be able to stop the wedding?  Or will Ursala succeed in marrying the love of Ariel's life?  Find out now in this Disney Classic that should remain back in print forever.
B000J103OI|3.0|To begin with, this film is billed as a \\"wicked\\" comedy but I found no laughs in it. Maybe two or three mild chuckles. All the telegraphed moments that were intended to be comedy were glaringly unoriginal. Virtually every demeaning thing Meryl Streep's character does to Anne Hathaway's has been done in at least two dozen movies in the past 25 years. Only the specifics have been updated. This one simply has the world's greatest actress doing them.<br /><br />Hathaway was cast because she's not only talented but also gorgeous and not emaciated. She is instantly likeable. Adrian Grenier is bland window-dressing as Hathaway's love interest. Chronic upstager Stanley Tucci is an actor I often can't appreciate but his under-the-top, small doses here keep him from being a liability. Streep is ... Streep! Her deft touch and perfect subtlety keep her absurd character in the realm of possibility. My biggest complaint is that her character's unsubtle hair is distractingly reminiscent of Glenn Close's Cruella Deville in Disney's \\"101 Dalmatians.\\"<br /><br />The entertaining and engaging parts primarily involve life lessons from the moral ambiguity that rears it head for Hathaway's character. However its lessons are contradictory and all over the map. Much of it is trite and all of it could have been done in a decent LifeTime movie but Streep and Hathaway bring it a level difficult to find on TV. And Hathaway's Andy ends up in a pretty questionable \\"happy ending\\" that belies her independence.<br /><br />The film tries it hand at subtle apologetics for the high fashion industry. Even though I didn't buy it, a few of them were food for thought. And it's neat to hear Streep wrap attitude around the word \\"cerulean.\\"
B000ASDFJU|5.0|If I were asked to descibe this complete collectors edition boxed set in one word, it would definately have to be \\"FABULOUS\\"! What better way to experience again and again each fantastic episode of this terrific series than in this comprehensive edition. Featured in the collection is the entire series run, along with many extras, such as color photos of the girls, bonus discs, and a gorgeous yet fetching pink velvet binder too keep the discs protected. HBO pulled out all the stops on this one, and it's sure to be a hit with fans & collectors alike. I've got mine.. do you?
1582701709|5.0|I bought the DVD, and then the book.  The book is a great companion piece for the film.  The content is spectacular, and life changing. I will be certain to buy copies for those that I love most.  Your life's dreams will begin in just a day or two!  I promise.
1594200823|5.0|Pollan does an amazing job of focusing light on our shadowy industrial food system. He sees the big picture and makes the reader see it too, and without condescension. His criticisms are balanced with positive alternatives, which keep the reader from spiraling into despair. Pollan's writing has the power of truth behind it. I hope Washington is listening.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|Skip tracks 7: beats are ok but not the lyrics, 8: just awful and should never made the cd or the light of day, 9: beats are boring and 11: an awful attempt at sounding like 80s Madonna. Tracks 3 - 5 are ok. My favorites are 1, 2, 6 and 10. Gwen should have worked with more producers. Too much of The Neptunes on the album and the their typical sound. Gwen's pictures are great though!!(A+)
006092988X|5.0|In this classic book, Betty Smith creates a world with such realistic characters and vivid scenes that it invites the reader in and doesn't let go until the final page.  The main character is Francie, a young girl who is a romantic like her father and yet a realist like her mother.  She loves to read and longs for an education so that she can overcome the squalid conditions in which she is growing up.  She is a survivor and does whatever it takes to get along in her world while having a rich life on the inside which no one else knows about.  Her father is an alcoholic who causes severe financial problems for his family but still shows Francie love in a way that her serious and responsible mother never can.  Her younger brother Neely is her constant companion and she loves him despite the fact that her mother favors him over Francie.  This book was written during the time that my mother was growing up and yet I can relate to many of the timeless scenes in it, such as the magical moments when Francie learns to read.  This is a wonderful book that should be taken off the shelf every few years and re-read.
B00000APLB|4.0|This is the best live Stones album since Get Yer Ya-Yas Out. Really enjoy it. Had it on 8-track \\"back in the day\\" and finally got the CD version. Band sounds terrific throughout, especially in the club setting. Like the Stones? You'll like this one.
B000A78Z82|5.0|Devendra Banhart is among the artists who were tagged as being part of the neo-folk revival that was all over the independent music press a few years ago. Thankfully, \\"freak folk\\" is much less of a buzz word right now, so anyone finding this music for the first time is most likely curious because they have a genuine interest, rather than because of some external pressure. <br /> <br />That having been said, Cripple Crow is a great album by a great artist and I would strongly recommend it to anyone new to Devendra Banhart. There's more emphasis on fun, catchy tunes and an easy-going hippie aesthetic here than on some of his earlier albums (tropicalia is a big influence) - more variety, too. In some ways, that detracts from the music's ability to draw the listener in, but it also makes Cripple Crow a joy to hear over and over again. In fact, I've enjoyed this album more and more on successive listens, a phenomenon that I don't often experience. <br /> <br />And the songs are really wonderful - I tend to listen to Cripple Crow for individual songs rather than as a cohesive whole. \\"Now that I Know\\", \\"Santa Maria de la Feira\\", \\"Heard Somebody Say\\", \\"Quedate Luna\\", \\"I Feel Just like A Child\\", \\"Dragonflies\\", \\"Cripple Crow\\", \\"Hey Mama Wolf\\", \\"Little Boys\\", and \\"Anchor\\" are all highlights. Buy it, try it, give it a chance.

B000065BPB|5.0|Got this for my boyfriend who is obssesed with quality sound equipment. I did a lot of research before buying these headphones. I initially looked at Bose but after reading so many reviews about how fragile they can be, I decided it just wasn't worth it to spend that amount of cash on something that if it breaks must be completely replaced. With Sennheiser you can virtually replace any component if needed so if something does happen you won't be out another 200 bucks. I settled on these for several reasons: 1. they collapse (my boyfriend travels so this is the most portable full-size headphones) 2. They sound fantastic! 3. Very comfortable padding and they fit his big head 4. replaceable parts which based on reviews shouldn't be necessary unless he abuses them 5. price is great when compared to similar grade headsets. 6. closed design means the people around him don't have to listen to his music as well. 7. noise reduction, he puts these babies on and can't hear a thing! My boyfriend actually uses these to go to sleep everyday as well as watching movies in his audio room instead of using the 5000 dollar system he has installed! They are very stylish looking too! I am so glad that I got these instead of falling for the name game and getting something way more expensive but less quality.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I orginally saw this movie as a rated version and came away very confused. I really enjoyed the unrated version of this film. It made much more sense to me. I don't know the difference in the two, but this one (to me) gave alot more explaination to what had happened. I do give the priest alot of credit going the full length and seeing it through. I won't give it away, so just see the movie and decide for yourself.
B000000OAA|5.0|Most hard-core Queen fans, such as myself, would agree that A Night at the Opera is their best, and possibly one of the best albums of all time.  However, Sheer Heart Attack is a close second in the Queen library.  This album has it all.  Hard rock, metal, ballads, a little ragtime, and the deliciously evil \\"Flick of the Wrist.\\" <br /> <br />I believe that Queen really came into their own with this album.  Although \\"Killer Queen\\" is the token radio friendly tune, the whole album is supremely entertaining.  A few of the standouts are \\"Tenement Funster\\", with Roger Taylor supplying the raspy vocals; the 90's-esque rock \\"Misfire\\"; the amusing and fun \\"Bring Back That Leroy Brown\\"; and \\"Flick of the Wrist.\\"  Like \\"Death on Two Legs\\" from A Night at the Opera, \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" is Queen at its hardest and darkest. <br /> <br />Sure A Night at the Opera may have put Queen on the map, but Sheer Heart Attack showed us who Queen really is.  Hard-driving, excellent written rock that sticks with you.  Listen to this album and you'll be hooked.  You will be adding \\"Misfire\\", \\"Bring Back That Leroy Brown\\", and \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" to your mp3 player.  Trust me.

B000002P2V|3.0|The last record with Moon, of course, and quite spotty. The production is odd and a bit off-putting (although nowhere near as bad as Tommy) but several excellent songs, including the title track, \\"905\\" and \\"Trick of the light\\".

Darkside of the moon lives up to its legend and will continue to entertain for generations onward.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This movie intrigued me from the start, but I have to confess that I had to see it a second time to \\"get\\" it. I think my problem was failing to grasp early on that it is an unusual movie and a movie that works on several different levels. Re-seeing it enhances it; it does not detract one bit from the excellent acting and the \\"mystery-filling\\" screen play. I can't give it 4 stars because it requires some effort on the part of the viewer. This effort was amply rewarded for ME, but it may not be for everyone. Overall, it is one of my TREASURES. (Five stars for me.) I highly recommend it for all who enjoy the challenge that VERY FEW movies give today. I want MORE, MORE, MORE!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|So there is still good new music being made. What makes a good song? For me its one that sticks in your head and the little voice in your head keeps playing it or parts of it for you. I have listened to this album just every day since I bought it. Such an unexpected collaboration of Knopfler and Emmy Lou I just find it a stunningly pleasant easy to listen to album. Mind you I'm glad the words are supplied as Marks diction is , well, typically Mark.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|The movie was in perfect shape. Although the outer case looked like someone jabbed it with a pin and scraped up with it the movie didn't have one scrach. That to me is all that matters I would buy from them again.

B000J103X4|4.0|After myself falling in love with the Game's first CD, I thought his next one surely wouldn't be able to compete. Now I've found that I like The Doctor's Advocate even better than his last. Game has proved that he can make a good album without the help of other major rap artists. He has certainly held his own on this one!

B000058983|5.0|This was a random purchase I made as part of my exploration of psychedelic music released during the late 1960's.  Happily, this turned out to be one of the nicer listening experiences I have had as of late and was generally impressed with the lush arrangements, acoustic textures, and melancholy mood.  Although sounding partly like a product of its time (November 1967), this album is pretty sophisticated musically, with themes of paranoia and death commingling with at least a few cheerier themes.  In spite of the fact that this record is largely unsung, it apparently influenced a few other musicians, as I can hear bits and pieces of this album on The Soft Parade (The Doors, 1969) and Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus (Spirit, 1970). The English folk/prog group Strawbs has also acknowledged the influence of Love on their From The Witchwood album of 1971.<br /><br />The musicians on Forever Changes include bandleader Arthur Lee (vocals, acoustic and electric guitars); John Ecols (lead electric guitar); Bryan Maclean (rhythm guitar and vocals - lead vocal on Alone Again and Old Man); Ken Forssi (electric bass guitar); and Michael Stuart (drums and percussion).  In addition to the key band members there is an additional bassist, guitarist, drummer, and a pianist along with string and brass ensembles.  The string ensemble is used a lot throughout and very effectively.  I guess it's worth noting that the liner notes indicate that Arthur felt that the band did not possess the technical ability of a Cream or a Jimi Hendrix Experience and channeled his efforts into arrangement.  As such, Forever Changes features layers and layers of instruments, excellent orchestration, rich vocal harmonies, nice melodies, acoustic textures, great production, and gloomy atmospheres.  As a progressive rock fan I certainly appreciate virtuosity but appreciate good arrangements a whole lot more - I really enjoyed this album a lot in fact.<br /><br />The eleven pieces (2'20\\" - 6'49\\") largely consist of strummed acoustic guitars and the occasional electric guitar solo atop a solid foundation of electric bass and drums.  Skillfully woven into the overall \\"psychedelic rock sound\\" are trumpet and string parts that range from classical to big band (just like Chicago used their brass section, although Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass sound does creep in there too).  The trumpets really add a distinctive touch, while the strings make an unavoidable Beatles connection.  Although I have described this music as melancholy and gloomy, there are occasionally bouncy and cheery sections that provide a nice balance.<br /><br />Rhino did a great job remastering this album and there are extensive liner notes and photos of the band.  The bonus tracks do not add too much, although they certainly are of historical value to fans of the band.<br /><br />This is a great album that should prove to be of interest to those folks that like the proto-progressive British bands such as The Moody Blues ([[ASIN:B000002GQG In Search of the Lost Chord]], 1968) and Procul Harum ([[ASIN:B000006ZZ6 A Salty Dog]], 1969) along with other American west coast psychedelic acts like Jefferson Airplane ([[ASIN:B0000A0DRX After Bathing at Baxter's]], 1967), Spirit ([[ASIN:B000002AF2 Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus]], 1970) and The Doors ([[ASIN:B000MCIBB6 Waiting for the Sun]], 1968).

B000003BDJ|5.0|When you talk about greatest hits albums by rock and roll stars, this is on the short list of the all-time best of such compilations.  The Stones' \\"Hot Rocks\\" records some of their hottest rock hits.  One could argue that other songs deserved to be on this album (e.g., \\"I'm Free\\" or \\"Not Fade Away\\" or one of the better tunes from \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\").  Nonetheless, this stands up extremely well.<br /><br />The 2 CD set begins with some of the oldest hits--\\"Time Is on My Side,\\" \\"Heart of Stone,\\" and \\"Play with Fire.\\"  Then, one of their greatest songs of all, \\"Satisfaction\\" (with the great guitar work of Keith Richards on this one).  There follow several songs that have very different atmospherics--from the softer sounding \\"As Tears Go By,\\" \\"Ruby Tuesday,\\" \\"Let's Spend the Night Together,\\" and \\"Wild Horses.\\"  There are also the more raucous rockers like \\"Get off of My Cloud,\\" the marvelous \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" (with one of the classic guitar riffs of all time), and \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" the raunchy \\"Honky Tonk Women,\\" and \\"Brown Sugar.\\"  Among the most exciting of such songs is \\"Midnight Rambler,\\" a live version of their \\"tribute\\" to the \\"Boston Strangler,\\" with lines that are quite evocative.  Another of those strange raucous rockers: \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\"  Here, they tell the story of misery over time, with the Devil at the heart of Jesus' death, the Czar's Death with the Bolshevik Revolution, World War II (\\"I rode a tank while the bodies stank\\") and the American political murders of the 1960s (\\"Well who killed the Kennedys?\\").  There are also those songs that tell stories that make one reflect a bit, such as \\"19th Nervous Breakdown,\\" \\"Mother's Little Helper,\\" \\"Paint It Black\\" (one of the bigger downers among hit songs in the 1960s), \\"You Can't always Get What You Want.\\"<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful compilation of their greatest hits from 1964 through 1971.  So much quality material was produced that there was enough left over for the follow up \\"More Hot Rocks.\\"  While there is much good and even great Stones' material since 1971, there is nothing like the density of quality work from those few years.  But, one wonders, how could there be?<br /><br />If anyone is interested in understanding the roots of the Rolling Stones body of work, this is a must buy.Rocks.\\"  While there is much good and even great Stones' material since 1971, there is nothing like the density of quality work from those few years.

B000J103YI|4.0|First of all let me say great movie! Seen it twice at show! Everyone claps after Jennifer Hudsons performace of And I Am Telling You Im Not Going. Anyway i dont own either copy of this officially, but have downloaded songs from it. I do notice that some of the songs are sung differently on this single version and the deluxe. Example on the Deluxe 2 cd set the song Hard To Say Goodbye My Love is the version from the movie where Beyonce is singing lead. The version on this single soundtrack its not Beyonce singing lead, its someone else. So some of the songs are different. Since i dont own either cd im not sure what other ones are exactly different, but im sure there is others like this example.

B00005JPCD|4.0|Not content to rely solely on the unusual mating habits of emperor pengins for his story, Miller turns this pengiun caper into a crusade against Antarctic fishing, as a community of penguins finds itself with a vastly depleted ocean, having to fight with nasty antarctic birds, leopard seals and other denizens of the deep for the slim pickings.  The weight of the world falls on the shoulders of Mumble, the \\"ugly duckling\\" of the brood, who has his rhythm in his feet rather than his voice.  The movie is chock full of soulful tunes as the emperor penguins compete for each other's affection through \\"love songs.\\"  It also provides a convenient way to differentiate between the huge flightless commnunity.<br /><br />Mumble finds himself left out of the mating game, forced to journey across the vast expanse of Antarctic in search of the mysterious reasons for the depleted stock of fish.  He joins up with penguins of another breed, including one named \\"Lovelace,\\" who mistakes a six-pack ring for a mantel of the gods, until it becomes a little too tight around the collar.  There are some tense moments, but my little girl didn't panic.  It was just a little bit too long for her to hold her coca-cola.  Eventually the great mystery is revealed and Mumble has the homecoming one would expect, with everyone dancing to his \\"Happy Feet.\\"  It is easy to see why the movie became a big audience favorite over the holiday season, as it maintains a playful momentum throughout the story, and in the end the precious balance is restored.
B000K4WPCC|2.0|I watched this move in hopes that it was going to be a cool scary movie filled with magic and fun. It wasn't really cool.....it really wasn't scary......it had magic and it was kind of fun. First of all I started rooting for the bad guy in this movie. I hated the main character. I hated him for no real reason other than jealousy. He is a good looking guy, with a nice car, going to a good school in hopes of going to Harvard one day, he has a beautiful girlfriend and on top of all this....he has super powers....what an a-hole! This movie was good for a laugh. There are points that are very ridiculous, and the characters are over reacting...such as when  Pogue finds out that Chase sends his girlfriend Kate to the hospital he runs away after Caleb tells him not to do anything stupid and turns around and says, in the most dramatic way possible, \\"We're talking about Kate!\\". Than he runs outside hops on his motor cycle (which is a good bike, especially for a 17 year old)  and gets his butt kicked by **surprise surprise** Chase! The bad guy!!!!!!! So in conclusion the movie was terrible, but you will find some entertaining parts through out all the crap.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|It appears that the big wigs at MARVEL want to get as much wattage out of their product and produce merchandise that continues to \\"re-vamp\\" their cannon of characters.  This foray into the \\"Invincible Iron Man\\" is more in the vien of what we've seen with the recent \\"Ultimate Avengers\\" line and is really very dramatically portrayed.  It's not great...the animation stands to be tweaked still...but the combination of computer-wizardry to bring to life Iron Man is quite engaging.<br /><br />If you're a fan and anxiously awaiting the upcoming big screen venture, this is for you, but the real nugget here is the sneak-peek into the next MARVEL animation release: DOCTOR STRANGE!  Now that's one property they can evolve into a fantastic series!

B000A7DVR2|5.0|This movie was recomended to me by of all people my father.  He said its a good stoner movie. Well right off the bat I was committed to seeing it so I went out and bought it.  The first viewing of the movie I was confused and wonderinf if in fact I mean well.... um if I liked it man, Then I watched it a second and third time... It started slowley growing on me man, My fourth and fifth viewing of the movie well ... umm... like I had been smokin some Tie stick man.... and like it was just far out especially the Halusination scenes. With every viewing I have picked up stuff that I had not noticed in previous viewings man, like everytime you watch it you will too.  The movie will definitly grow on you man, so grab a white russian man, and just go and pop in the movie man, and pretty soon you will be calling your self \\"THE DUDE\\" you will be saying \\"SHUT THE F**K DONNIE\\" etc.  One of the true Stoner movies glad I saw the movie, I highly recommend it man.
B00004SU5J|5.0|This is one of my favorite cd's. The reason I have bought it so many times is because once my get scratched from playing it over and over, I will continually buy this cd. The colaboration of songs and the different types of sound makes this cd a must for instrumental.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The Beatles in 5.1! Who'd-a thunk it? And that it was created by their original producer, George Martin, and his son, only adds to the credibility of this project. I have not seen the Cirque du Soleil production for which this recording was created, people with whom I have spoken who have seen it have glowed about the show. Hearing all of these wonderful songs with new, more vibrant mixes and some very effective reworkings, have only reinforced my belief that this was a group way ahead of their time. If this is a precursor to more music by the Fab 4 being remixed for 5.1 DVD-Audio, I will be happy to add them to my already burgeoning collection. Bring 'em on, Capitol!
0440234743|5.0|I've read every book Grisham has written and genuinely enjoyed them all.  However, \\"The Testament\\" is at the top of my list from this author, followed closely by \\"The Firm.\\"  There is a reason why Grisham is consistently at the top of the bestseller lists: he's an excellent storyteller.  I also appreciate the fact that he manages to do it without gratuitous violence, sex, and language.  His plots always ring authentic, and his mastery of the genre is unquestioned.  He's a class act.<br /><br />\\"The Testament\\" is a wonderful story of greed, redemption, and the things in life that money cannot buy.  The book opens with 78-year old Troy Phelan, a self-made and highly eccentric billionaire, on his deathbed.  His ex-wives, children, lawyers, and hangers-on circle like vultures, anticipating the $11 billion that will soon be divided amongst them.  But when he dies, Phelan's last will and testament reveals that he has thumbed his nose at them all and left his entire estate to an estranged daughter, a missionary in the remote regions of Brazil.  While the jilted would-be heirs fight and connive, attempting to overturn the will of the \\"insane\\" Phelan, the story's protagonist, Nate O'Riley, is sent to Brazil with a mission: find Phelan's estranged daughter and rightful heir.  But his task is by no means easy, and it takes the better part of the book for O'Riley to catch up to her.  However, what he finds both inspires and changes him, redeeming a lawyer badly in need of redemption and bringing the story to a wonderful resolution.<br /><br />All in all a highly satisfying, highly recommended read.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I just have to hope this will not be the last project from these two legends of guitar. Songs like \\"Ride The River\\" can make a bad day go away in a heartbeat. I didn't know JJ Cale live in Valley Center (Near Escondido) - so, that's cool we have legends like his residing in our region. I will be seeing EC in San Diego this March...maybe, just maybe JJ Cale could 'pop in' for a song on stage with Clapton. Always like to be hopeful. Peace - JG \\"Bear\\"
B000002JKA|5.0|This album is so good.  I immediately got hooked on The Mirror and Lie cause I'm naturally drawn to the heavier stuff.  Once you open up to the entire album it's amazing start to finish. <br /> <br />It's probably the deepest and darkest of all their albums, even Train of Thought IMO.  The lyrics are about stuggles with friendships, religion and faith...themes almost everyone can relate to at one point or another.  Knowing Kevin Moore left the band immediately following this albums completion makes his lyrical contribution to it even more interesting. <br /> <br />It's assumed the musicianship is top-notch, this IS Dream Theater we're talking about.  James' voice is awesome on this CD, much edgier than their other albums.   <br /> <br />My favorite songs are Caught in a Web, The Mirror, Lie, and Scarred.  Scarred is probably my fav of all.  It's a very progressive epic...John Petrucci an absolutely amazing guitar player and song writer.
B00009W0U4|4.0|This movie is hard to sit through, due to its harsh nature.  Some people might also dislike the style in which the story is portrayed.  It's told in reverse order, with awkward and revolving camera shots, dark and almost incomprehensible imagery, plus bizarre sound effects.  It has a very twilight zone feel to it.<br /><br />But its done in a very artistic manner, with the intention of numbing the audience.  This movie wouldn't have the same effect if it was told in the more standard format.  Brilliant filmmaking.<br /><br />There are a couple of the most savage and violent scenes I have ever experienced. They are horrifying, probably too much for some people to bare.<br /><br />Irreversible is a great film, but I wouldn't call it enjoyable.  It's not for the weak at heart.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|The only reason I did not give this CD five stars is because there are many elements here that are to be found in one or two of her previous works, mainly \\"Book of Secrets\\" and \\"The Mask and the Mirror\\".  Yet, in spite of this, Ms. McKennett deliveres another lively and sensitive concept album that is hard to turn away from.  The melodies are heartfelt and haunting, and the blending of middle eastern with celtic musical imagery are brilliant.  If you have waited as long as I have for this (almost 10 years since her last studio release) prepare to be pleasantly suprised.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|This film grabs the viewer from the opening scene.  Through a winter's bleak landscape, a car's easy progress along the dark road is enhanced by the sedate pace of the background music.  Before the credits have stopped running, the car is rolling into the roadside stream, the occupants clearly lost.  An oncoming vehicle has driven them off the road deliberately, then continues on.  Why has such a murder occurred?<br /><br />Coleman Sylk [Hopkins] a classics scholar, denies a student's charge of racism as \\"spectacularly false\\", yet resigns his college post in protest.  He contacts Nathan Zuckerman [Sinise] to commission him to write the story of his life - the son of \\"the only Jewish saloon keeper in East Orange\\".  Zuckerman, a writer suffering \\"block\\" is reluctant to undertake the task, but as he learns more about Sylk, he becomes fascinated by the man.  The unfolding story is far more of \\"An American Tragedy\\" than Theodore Dreiser could have ever envisioned.<br /><br />Sylk, whose real story is far more convoluted than that of the \\"son of a Jewish saloon keeper\\", is an angry man.  His outbursts aren't violent - that aspect of his life is clearly under tight control.  But the events of his youth are reflected in his dealings with others in his later life.  To explain this, Sylk's early life [Wentworth Miller] is portrayed as a succession of deceptions, from his struggle to follow his own desires against his father's wishes, to that father's own role in life.  Coleman wanted to be boxer - he was good in the ring.  But he follows a different path to become a classical scholar.  The \\"first Jew to teach classical literature in America\\" - according to narrator Zuckerman.<br /><br />The source of Coleman's ire becomes clear when he tells Zuckerman about his first love.  While in university, he meets a young woman and invites her home to dinner.  The result is an act in a long-term tragedy. A tragedy that has yet to be played out both in the film and in real life.  Convoluting Coleman's already bizarre existence is his unexpected encounter with Faunia Farley [Nicole Kidman].  In what is demonstrably her best role, Kidman is a woman beset by tragic circumstances.  Their liaison, which should be completely out of character for both, proves stable and enduring.  A cynical farm woman struggling for survival, she should have little to offer the classics scholar.  But Coleman's own struggles provide a hidden bond.  The two become lovers, mutually reinforcing and restoring a positive approach to their lives.<br /><br />It's easy for Hopkins to impart tension in a film role - he's done it often enough.  But here, he displays a new version of that emotion.  There is the visible manifestation of self-control.  While he can release his rage when he's relating his story to Zuckerman, a whole new aspect appears when he's with Kidman.  In turn, while she might simply be grateful for his attention, Kidman becomes enamoured of his qualities.  She discovers his strengths and capacities, leading her to develop a sincere affection for this stranger.  Together, the endure challenges and overcome them.  All but the last one.<br /><br />There are many roles in this film deserving applause.  Anna Deveare Smith's depiction of Coleman's mother, Ed Harris as Faunia's ex-husband and, of course, Jacinda Barrett as Coleman's university-days lover stand out well under Benton's direction.  Hopkins and Kidman, however, rightly dominate this production.  Kidman, in particular, exhibits a capacity hardly promised in her other roles.  This film is reminiscent of two of Sean Connery's in which two co-stars, Lorraine Bracco and Catherine Zeta-Jones seem to suddenly blossom out of previous mediocrity.  Was there an unforeseen magic between Hopkins and Kidman, or did Benton provide a catalyst needed to bring out the best these two could provide?  However the formula worked, the product is something outstanding.

B000GPI2EK|4.0|I own Remission, which I can't say I enjoyed very much; and I own Leviathan, which I thought had several great ideas but was ultimately plagued by some horrible flaws. I never agreed with all the hysteria regarding Mastodon being the saviors of heavy metal and whatnot (and I still don't), and consequently I haven't really been keeping up with the band. So, it wasn't exactly to my surprise when Blood Mountain was released and praise for the band had apparently grown exponentially within the week... same old sludgy stoner metal, I thought. <br /> <br />Not so. <br /> <br />Going on the whole elements thing, Blood Mountain is focused around earth. I'm not entirely sure what Mastodon were going for here, but it involves a guy making his way up a mountain, facing all sorts of trials on the way in the form of various fantastical beasts, and reaching some sort of enlightenment in the end. Not as cheesy as it may sound. <br /> <br />The first major point of difference involves the vocals. No longer are they inconsequential like in Remission, nor are they the mostly vomit-inducing garbage found on Leviathan. They're at the forefront of the mix and play an important role. Bassist/vocalist Troy Sanders sounds sort of like a soaring Josh Homme from Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age (who has a guest appearance here), and guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds tries his best to blatantly rip off Neurosis' Scott Kelly (who, coincidentally, also has a guest appearance here), but doesn't really succeed. Or maybe it's the other way around... I'm not 100% sure who sings what. An amusing thing is the sometimes negative impact that otherwise great guest vocals have here - notably Scott Kelly's appearance on the second track \\"Crystal Skull\\". He comes in midway through the song with that powerful roar that he's so well known for... and ends up totally embarrassing Troy and Brent when they come back into the fray afterwards. It reminds me of what happened on \\"Blood and Thunder\\" off of Leviathan, when Neil Fallon of Clutch came in to sing his part and consequently made the Mastodon boys sound utterly trivial and weak in comparison. Regardless, the vocals here are far improved over anything Mastodon displayed in the past... except for the robotic vocal effects used on \\"Circle of Cysquatch\\", which are remarkably awful. <br /> <br />The next (or actually, this should have probably been the first) thing you notice is drummer Brann Dailor. This guy has always walked a fine line between righteous drumming and unnecessary hyperactivity... and on Blood Mountain, I think he has finally crossed it. He constantly traverses his relatively small kit with incredible speed, throwing in fill, after fill, after fill, after fill, after fill. In fact, you probably wouldn't be too far off base if you said that some of the songs on here are comprised completely of fills. I'm not trying to put Dailor's talent down or anything, it's just that he tends to overindulge himself quite often on this album. A lot of the fills are totally great though, like on \\"Siberian Divide\\" - holy crap is that song amazing. There's also a lot of groove to be found here, and a good level of diversity. \\"Sleeping Giant\\" features some beautiful and extremely fluid drumming throughout the introductory passage and again somewhere towards the middle... I was surprised and pretty damn impressed. <br /> <br />The riffing has taken a few steps up... sounds like Bill Kelilher finally remembered his technical death days in Lethargy. Phew. I'm not going to go through all the great riffs that exist on this album, as there are a lot of them, but suffice it to say that just about every song has something exceptional to offer in that respect (except for maybe \\"Bladecatcher\\", which has some weird King Crimson-esque noodling and nothing that's very riff-oriented). There are also a few guitar solos thrown around and several extended instrumental interludes, all of which actually amount to a refreshing development in Mastodon's sound. <br /> <br />An exceptional release, all in all.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore did a fantastic job in articulating the consequences of global warming in An Inconvenient Truth. While providing a narrative explaining the risks of the human race's reliance on fossil fuel, he also offers stunning images showing concrete examples of the effects of global warming. Indeed, An Inconvenient Truth makes an excellent movie that the whole family can watch.<br /><br />One misconception with this movie is that it is dense with facts and figures explaining scientific data. While there is substantive information contained in Gore's narration, a large collection images and interviews allow the viewer to quickly absorb the message.  In these images, various ice formations from 50-70 years ago are juxtaposed with their current state.  In total, they make for a compelling story alone.<br /><br />What is missing from the story is a thorough explanation of the economics behind conservation and energy independence that any Republican would love. Energy independence and conservation offer a host of pure economic motives including improving overall industrial efficiency and promoting domestic agricultural resources. Likewise, investment in alternative technology will keep America in the forefront of the alternative energy market where it has been losing ground to Germany and Japan. This virtuous circle is not outlined in this movie, unfortunately.<br /><br />An Inconvenient Truth serves its mission in explaining to the lay community the causes and consequences of Global Warming. Al Gore accomplishes this in telling interesting story with supporting evidence. Whether you are an environmentalist or merely hardcore republican concerned about energy security, spread the message by inviting friends and business colleague to watch the movie.<br /><br />NOTES:<br /><br />The Economic Story that is missing:<br /><br />*PURE ECONOMICS - HIGH ROI<br /><br />Improved energy efficiency ultimately costs less (e.g. compact fluorescent light bulbs, diesel automobiles)<br /><br />Provides higher performance (e.g. greater home insulation, improved windows)<br /><br />*REDUCTION OF FOREIGN LEVERAGE ON UNITED STATES<br /><br />Lessens vulnerability to foreign powers<br /><br />Reduces US military presence in other countries<br /><br />*MACROECONOMICS<br /><br />Provides consumers with more spending power (e.g. less spent on electricity allows more spending at Wal-Mart)<br /><br />Reduces peripheral waste (e.g. reduction of container packaging requires less waste hauling)<br /><br />*DOMESTIC RESOURCE ULTILIZATION<br /><br />Promotes domestic sources of energy (e.g. corn and soybeans)<br /><br />Domestic production of wind power and solar systems<br /><br />*INFRASTRUCTURE STABILITY<br /><br />Distributed power fights disruption (e.g. solar panels provide local power - down power lines don't impact end user)<br /><br />A broader range of energy sources combats reliance on a single source that can be disrupted<br /><br />Fights spikes that cause blackouts (e.g. photovoltaic cells produce power during highest demand times)<br /><br />Reduces strain on current infrastructure (e.g. reduces creation of more power lines, transformers)<br /><br />Better use of land area (e.g. solar panels on roof require no additional land area)<br /><br />*BETTER UTILIZATION OF HUMAN POWER<br /><br />Walking, bicycling, using the stairs improves health and fights obesity<br /><br />Pedal power and public transportation reduces congestionsmobiles)  <br />Provides higher performance (e.g. greater home insulation, improved windows) <br /> <br />*REDUCTION OF FOREIGN LEVERAGE ON UNITED STATES <br />Lessens vulnerability to foreign powers <br />Reduces US military presence in other countries <br /> <br />*MACROECONOMICS <br />Provides consumers with more spending power (e.g. less spent on electricity allows more spending at Wal-Mart) <br />Reduces peripheral waste (e.g. reduction of container packaging requires less waste hauling) <br /> <br />*DOMESTIC RESOURCE ULTILIZATION <br />Promotes domestic sources of energy (e.g. corn and soybeans) <br />Domestic production of wind power and solar systems <br /> <br />*INFRASTRUCTURE STABILITY <br />Distributed power fights disruption (e.g. solar panels provide local power - down power lines don't impact end user) <br />A broader range of energy sources combats reliance on a single source that can be disrupted <br />Fights spikes that cause blackouts (e.g. photovoltaic cells produce power during highest demand times) <br />Reduces strain on current infrastructure (e.g. reduces creation of more power lines, transformers) <br />Better use of land area (e.g. solar panels on roof require no additional land area) <br /> <br />*BETTER UTILIZATION OF HUMAN POWER <br />Walking, bicycling, using the stairs improves health and fights obesity  <br />Pedal power and public transportation reduces congestions <br /> <br />
0618680004|5.0|Let me be frank, I loved this book.  It's a wonderful jab at all things religious.  It's very much a case that the emperor has no clothes and Richard Dawkins has the role of pointing out the obvious.<br /><br />Dawkins' work mainly acts as a critique of Christianity although it can be equally applied to any religion.  His approach is one of taking no prisoners.  He has no time for faiths.  These are simply superstitions that rely on intolerance and hypocrisy.  He is an articulate man with a clear message.  He sees religion as something that should not enjoy the following it is provided by some of the population.<br /><br />Dawkins is a breath of fresh air.  Those who succumb to religion are, at best, misguided.  At worst, they are stupid.  Yet why is it that religion seemingly cannot be questioned?  Why are we implored to show \\"respect\\" for religion and the religious?  It is not inappropriate to question people about most other aspects of their lives, but to question someone's religion is deemed to be disrespectful.  This way of seeing the world is nonsensical.  Religion should be exposed to the light of day.<br /><br />The history of Christianity is poor.  It has condoned the crusades, the inquisition and the witch hunts.  It is an appalling history by which it should be roundly condemned.  It deserves closer examination and Dawkins has achieved this end in a lucid and incisive manner.<br /><br />I have little doubt that this book will be criticised by the various self-appointed moral guardians amongst us.  Yet this really does not represent a threat.  In the fullness of time, reason and science always wins over superstition and darkness.

B00005JPAM|5.0|The British monarchy is an anachronism.  How in a modern society can we reconcile birth right privilege with progress and democracy?  The two should be mutually antagonistic.  In the long run, the monarchy will first be cast off by nations such as Canada and Australia.  In due course, its days will be numbered even in England.  Yet, in spite of its very anachronistic nature, it continues to draw breath.<br /><br />The film, \\"The Queen\\" covers the events following the death of Princess Diana.  We are given an opportunity to look inside both the royal household and within 10 Downing Street.  It was the royal household that could not understand the outpouring of public grief over Diana's death.  It was Tony Blair that dragged the Queen reluctantly into an understanding of this grief.  I must admit that, at the time and still to this day, I cannot myself understand why so many people fell for Diana.  She was an intellectual lightweight who could be moody and self-indulgent.  Her end should have been little more than a historical footnote.  The fact that it wasn't is the real conundrum.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is brilliant as the Queen.  She is totally plausible.  Indeed, the whole cast is quite stunning.  The cast allows the events to unfold while the viewer is swept along for the ride.  And a great ride it is!  Anyone over the age of twenty should be able to recall the events surrounding the death of Diana.  However, at no time is the film stale.  It is tense drama at its best!  I can thoroughly recommend this film.
0140067477|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend that swears by it because it helped him through a difficult time in his life.  I lost interest after the first couple of pages but forced myself to finish it.  The author simplifies Taoist thought to the point that it is in line with any philosophy or religion. If you follow the golden rule and listen to your instincts, congratulations, you’re a Taoist. He makes his points by insulting every character from Winnie the Pooh, except for the great Pooh of course, and almost every profession. He needed to spend more time explaining the principles of Taoism and less time trying to explain what it is not.  It is not a good introduction to Taoist thought, it just made me want to find a book that is.  That is not to mention the bad writing style and confusing analogies.  Interesting topic with potential but in the hands of a bad writer it turned to crap.

More's the pity that that we have not heard more collaborative efforts from these two masters.<br /><br />\\"The Road to Escondido\\" is a laid back master piece.  Cale and Clapton work well together.  They have produced a terrific compilation that deserves a wide audience.  The genre is hard to classify as it is a mix of rock, Cajun, folk and blues.  Regardless, it works!  May we see this duo continue to work together in the future.  Take my advice, get this CD.  Your efforts will be rewarded.

B000H0MKO2|4.0|Aaron Eckhart carries \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" with his witty edgy performance.  His teeth are all sunshine and front words that exist in a moral vacuum called the profit motive.  The film satirically highlights how profit motive must be tempered with service motive.  Eckhart is famous for his work with Neil La Bute such as \\"In the Company of Men.\\"  He has also branched into other films like \\"Erin Brockovich\\" & \\"The Black Dahlia.\\"  He deserved his Best Actor Golden Globe nomination for this film.  His son is played by Cameron Bright who was the creepy reincarnated soul of Nicole Kidman in \\"Birth\\" and has also appeared in \\"X-Men 3\\" & \\"Ultraviolet.\\"  Nick's best friends are also lobbyists, Maria Bello (\\"Assault on Precinct 13\\" & \\"A History of Violence\\") plays Polly Bailey and Saturday Night Live's David Koechner plays Bobby Jay Bliss.  William H. Macy plays a neurotic senator; Robert Duvall is the Captain of tobacco; Sam Elliott's the Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch; and Rob Lowe is the Hollywood super-agent Jeff Megall.  For his first directorial project, Jason Reitman creates a funny, offbeat comedy that certainly twists our moral expectations.

A few years ago when Elv1s 30 #1 Hits came out, I bought it.  A few years later 2nd to None came out and I bought that.  HOWEVER, HitStory arrived, I was shocked to see it being nothing more than the previous 2 collections sold with a new CD.  Why would I spend money on CDs I already have?  This is not to say that the King's music is not important...IT IS THE BEST.  But why spend money on something you already own?
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This is one of those films that deserved a bigger audience. Why didn't it get one?

I LOVED the movie but it is only part comedy--it's mostly tough, sometimes tragic. Just like life. A+ to all performances, excellent across the board, and A++ to little Olive, Abigail Breslin.

B00005JP9V|4.0|Children of Men takes place in Britain in the year 2027. The film begins with the death of the world's youngest person, Baby Diego. The world mourns his death in a manner usually reserved for larger than life figures like Mother Theresa and Princess Diana. Women weep in the streets and people stand transfixed by the television watching the report of his death. Baby Diego was 18 years old.<br /><br />In this version of the future, women are infertile and there hasn't been a human birth in nearly 20 years. Clive Owen plays Theo, a Brit who is just living day to day, but who has become lost in a world thrown into turmoil by its impending doom. Fertility tests are mandatory in this future, the world is at war, and Britain is the only place that seems to have some hold on civilization. Accordingly, people flock to get there, but the borders are strictly patrolled and refugees are locked in cages and displayed for all to see.<br /><br />Julianne Moore plays Julian, the leader of a \\"terrorist\\" organization called Fish, whose goal is to allow a home for every refugee who seeks asylum in Britain. She is also Theo's ex-wife. She comes to him after years of separation to ask him to help transport the first pregnant woman in nearly 20 years. It his her hope that the birth of this child might stop the turmoil and strife engulfing the country and possibly bring the world back from the brink of chaos.<br /><br />Children of Men paints a rather bleak picture of the future and, in this respect, was at times hard to watch. The world is torn apart by its impending doom and people have nothing left to live for.  This unborn child could give hope to the many who have lost it, but there are others who would use it for their own ends. This film was gripping, engaging, and moving despite the fact that it's also depressing, violent, and difficult to watch. The lack of a future has thrown the world into utter chaos with people being killed in the streets, the government dropping bombs at random, and anarchists fighting to put the world back in order. The fate of the future rests in the hands of someone who isn't even born yet, and that's something that's hard to perceive.  Still, I think Children of Men is definitely worth watching and it definitely starts the 2007 film season with a bang.at random, and anarchists fighting to put the world back in order.

B000002LEE|5.0|To this day, 'Nothing's Shocking' remains one of the most original rock albums ever recorded. Catchy bass lines, wailing guitar solos, unique drumming sequences, and of course - Perry Ferrell's vocals. Ferrell's performance alone would qualify this album as one of the all-time greats as his voice whines, yells, and echoes like no other - AMAZING.<br /><br />On 'Nothing's Shocking' the band combines arena rock and indie/underground sounds to create this musical masterpiece. The mellow bass line of 'Up the Beach' starts off the album before introducing the listener to Navarro's wailing guitar lead and Ferrell's brilliant vocals with his 'oos' in the background along with other various sounds. The next song 'Ocean Size' begins with an acoustic melody backed by some more 'oos' from Perry before the music stops and Ferrell yells 'Three, Four!!!', kicking off the explosion of arena rock size guitars. From there on the album shifts in and out of different styles and never gets boring. The combination of catchy tunes like 'Standing in the Shower Thinking' and 'Had a Dad', ballads like 'Summertime Rolls' and the infamous 'Jane Says', funky and weird tunes like 'Idiots Rule' and 'Pigs in Zen', and the explosive rock classic 'Mountain Song' makes this album a brilliant composition that is essential to any music fan.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: If you enjoy Perry Ferrell's vocals and musical abilities be sure to include Porno for Pyros album 'God's Good Urge' into your collection. Although much mellower in sound, it contains beautiful vocal arrangements from Ferrell and wonderful melodies similar to the more quiet pieces by Jane's Addiction.

B000063CMK|5.0|Honestly, the music on this album is so moving, so inventive, so unique, that trying to explain it to someone is almost futile. You would benefit yourself immensely if you just stopped reading my review right now and immediately bought this album.<br /><br />This music does not easily fall into any category, but if you are a fan of progressive rock/metal, alternative, classical, or just a music fan in general, then you NEED this album. If I had to choose one word to describe the sound it would be EPIC.<br /><br />The first track 'Of Two Beginnings' gives you an idea of the diversity, emotion, and complexity that will captivate your ears when listening through the entire album. Starting with a mellow, eery mood and Daniel's soft melodic vocals beginning the story of this concept album, not even a minute into the song the atmosphere changes dramatically with the vocals becoming a deeper emotional yell backed by pounding riffs, various background vocals, and wailing guitars - within 2 minutes the song is back to a mellow mood again before immediately taking you into the next song with a loud melodic guitar piece that almost makes you cry.<br /><br />The entire album is full of climactic mood changes, intelligent lyrics, and unpredictable complex song arrangments that defy normality. The drumming, keyboards, strings, vocals, and other sounds are arranged in such perfect beauty that the listener can only sit in wonder and amazement at the quality of sound coming forth from their speakers.<br /><br />My personal favorite track is 'Trace of Blood', an epic 8 minute tale of a couple's emotions over having a miscarriage, full of great guitar work and hauntingly moving vocals. 'Dryad of the Woods' is a beautiful 5 minute instrumental piece that has just as much emotion as any of the songs accompanied by Daniel's broad vocal range. There is no bad song on this album, and one song runs into the other making a complete musical masterpiece.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: Do yourself a favor and buy not only this album, but every POS release. If you have to choose one more to buy after 'Remedy Lane' then purchase 'The Perfect Element 1' - another masterpiece, but you cannot go wrong with any music by this band. The new album 'Scarsick' is coming out this month!N: Do yourself a favor and buy not only this album, but every POS release.

B000K7VHPU|3.0|This movie might have been far more compelling if it resolved the central mystery of the movie, the one factor which made this movie special, which was: how did he pull off the illusion trick?<br /><br />Because the movie failed to answer this question, it ultimately made the movie weak.  This is not just a complaint for not satisfying my curiosity.  Rather, since the message of the movie was that, \\"it is not as it seems\\", and because the storyline is founded on this tenet, the movie would have been a lot stronger if the illusion, which is the central trick of the movie and what made Eisenheim so special, had a scientific explanation.  In other words, the story explains in a series of flashbacks in the final minutes how Eisenheim pulled off his plan, which is in line with the central tenet, but because it fails to explain the actually more fascinating question of how he pulled off his other trick - the illusions - the movie ultimately became much less compelling to the viewer.<br /><br />If I were the writer of this script, I would have introduced a clever illusion trick that is, perhaps, less spectacular than Eisenheim's illusions but which do have scientific explanations.  Moreover, I would have made Eisenheim's masterplan share its logical foundation with his illusion trick which he performs on stage.  This way, the two major tricks on this movie, the illusion and Eisenheim's plan to get away, would be tied togethr and bolster each other, thereby making the movie stronger and also be logical.<br /><br />But because the illusion was left as a mystical trick rather than a logical one, it ended up upstaging the story and weakening the logical basis of the plot.  And by itself, the plot - Eisenheim's master plan to bring down the crown prince and run away with you know who - degenerates to the level of a second-rate card trick, something far better done in any of Agatha Christie's mysteries.<br /><br />Yet another example of potential ruined by an illogical and weak script.nd weak script.
B0000019PA|5.0|The song \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" first touched my ears back in college on the student-run radio station.  They (of course) did not announce the band name, and I spent a couple of weeks calling to ask the station if they knew \\"the song with the saw in it.\\"    I finally bought the album and listened only to that track for a couple of years.  Then I got an Mp3 player and started using headphones to listen to music again; I gave the rest of the songs a real listen and have been hooked for life.      This is what music is supposed to be. It is subtle even when loud.  The lyrics are scattered in such a way that you get little fragments of enlightenment--you understand and then you are suddenly and beautifully confused.  It hurts.  And then the pain feels like joy.      I save it for Spring listening; the chaotic buzz of instruments and Mangum's unbridled voice make it explode with the urgency of young love, of rebirth.  It seeps and irritates like pollen and bursts \\"like fruit falling out from the holes.\\"  After hearing the track \\"Oh Comely,\\"  I have to sit in silence for a while--no other music will do.    Buy it. With headphones if needed--and prepare to hear it a hundred times over.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|For years I've pulled out Bob Marley's \\"Legend\\" on occasion and enjoyed it as a classic.  It, honestly, had never occured to me to check out what the other Marley's have done musically as I assumed it'd be more of the same and I thought you couldn't improve on the original.  What I found with Damian Marley's \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" just simply amazed me.  I like reggae but I love what Damian is doing.  His music can only be described as reggae with electronic infusion and rap/r&b sounds with a rock/r&b beat.  This album really has something for everyone that likes everything from rap to rock, r&b to reggae and more.  My personal favorites are \\"Pimp's Paradise\\", \\"Hey Girl\\" and \\"Road to Zion\\".
B000JJS8TM|1.0|I received The Beatles LOVE CD/DVD as a Christmas Gift. <br />I had heard about it and read reviews, and so I was very excited to listen to it. <br /> <br />I would have given this a ZERO stars, but it was not an option here on Amazon. <br /> <br />The first track \\"Because\\": Well, I already heard the same version (acapella) on the anthology CD, but this one had longer than normal pauses between lines.  It made absolutely NO sense to me, and I found it to be artistically annoying! <br /> <br />I won't get into each track, but I found all of them to make me feel the same.  I love every single Bealtes song, but I found that this entire CD/DVD (audio only) to be one of the biggest rip off scams I've seen in a while.  Perhaps Sir George is a bit low on cash and needed to re-introduce some of the best Beatles tunes again? But to claim to have added an artistic blend is rediculous.  But... as we, die-hard fans do...running out  and spending the $20 to buy it, just to add it to our collection, I'm sure Geo and Son are making a killing! <br /> <br />After listening to the CD, I actually thought about throwing the whole thing out the window, as I drove down CA-1 highway.  But... I waited, because I saw that there was a DVD included. <br /> <br />Not realizing that it was just an AUDIO DVD (what purpose does an audio DVD serve anyway?).  I plugged it in, hoping to see some Beatles images/footage I had not yet seen.  But instead, more disappointment.  The only t hing I \\"saw\\" was the album cover with the exact same annoying remixed tracks.  Another huge rip off. <br /> <br />I don't typically bother writing reviews, but I felt I needed to share my feelings on this one, especially after reading the RAVE reviews from other folks here on Amazon.  I think this Album is anything BUT genius.  It reminds me of a really bad You-tube re-mix.  Even the disco era remix of beatles \\"Hooked on Beatles\\" was better than this, and I didn't like that either, but at least it had continuity! <br /><br />Ok... enough.  Good luck if you still decide to buy this album.  I'm sure Sir Geo and his son will appreciate the new found millions! <br /> <br />Now... how do I return this to Amazon to get something worth listening to???
B0001FUHV6|3.0|In the movie the music fit perfectly.  In the soundtrack, much of it is jarring to my senses.  The two songs I like the best are worth the price of admission, however, and bring tears to my eyes.  <br />Janice Lawson - Montana

B000FP2OPY|5.0|For those of you who have never seen Supernatural, it is a fantastic show about a two brothers traveling across the country hunting demons. However that explanation doesn't begin to do justice to this show. If you were a fan of the X-files, this is the show you've been waiting for to fill the void. Fantastic settings, great story lines, and an amazing soundtrack to boot. Its best described as Route 66 with demons. If you're a fan of sci-fi, fantasy or horror TV shows i suggest you check this show out. <br />For those of you who have watched Supernatural you may be wondering why you should by the DVD. BONUS FEATURES. This DVD set is packed with them, commentaries from the actors and creators, and mini-documentaries about the show. This is most certainly a DVD set that does not dissapoint.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I'd heard previous Mayer CDs, shoved in my face by a friend at work and obviously one of John's biggest fans. You know how it is. Everyone wants to turn you on to whatever thrills them. Sorry to disappoint but I wasn't even remotely moved by what I heard. Some time passed and my friend gave it another try with \\"Continuum\\". I liked everything from the first song to the last. So, if you are already a Mayer fan you probably think I'm an idiot for not liking previous attempts. Maybe I'll listen to them again to see if it was just a mood of the moment thing. If you are just wondering about \\"Continuum\\" I'll tell you, in my opinion, its a great way to introduce yourself to John Mayer and possibly the direction he is currently headed.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Oh how George Lucas teases us Star Wars fans, for years we've been waiting for a re-release of the theatrical version of our beloved Star Wars and finally our prayers have been answered... kind of. The original version is more of an afterthought on this DVD set. I would have loved for Lucas to have treated the original with the respect that we the star wars fans would have shown in, instead of slapping it onto the 2nd disc of a DVD set. <br />But i digress, i bought this the first day it came out, and if he releases another version i'll buy that too. but do yourself a favor, if you have kids who've never seen Star Wars before, or you somehow have never seen it, this is the edition to buy...and make sure you watch the theatrical version first, you'll finally understand what us Star Wars fans mean when we say that Han shot first!

The beats laid out by Timberlake and Timberland are infectious, but not in an ear worm kind of way. This is a rare CD where its not just a few radio singles while the rest of the album is sub-par, this CD is a great listen all the way through. If i have only one beef with this album its that I wish the Intros could have been extended into songs, you never want them to stop! However that right there is one of the best reasons to buy Future Sex/ LoveSounds, if you only listen to the singles released on the radio you will be missing quite a lot!

B00003CXA4|5.0|Director Richard Attenborough's epic biographical film `Gandi' released in '82 is one of those rare, magnificent films that not only entertains and informs, but ultimately transforms the viewers consciousness for the better. Yes that's right, I'm talking about transformation.<br /><br />If you're like me you'll slowly and subtly experience a discernable shift of consciousness while watching this film. The first thing you'll notice is an alteration in your breathing pattern as it takes on a slow, rhythmic quality. This will soon be followed by a pronounced shift in your mode of thinking. Your analytical mind will disengage as your thought processes become more symbolic and filled with images pregnant with meaning. Now as you continue absorbing the vast, unfathomable grandeur of India your focus will narrow on the slight, slender figure of an Indian man, Gandi (brilliantly portrayed by Ben Kingsley). His words and deeds will envelope you and force you to re-evaluate what it means to be human. Now it has become more than a movie, it has become a lesson in how to live.<br /><br />Attenborough has truly gifted us with a timeless tale of a great man and his loving legacy for Mother India. Along with a storyline that must be told the film contains breathtaking cinematography and an entrancing soundtrack that will remain with you long after the closing credits.<br /><br />'Gandi' is without question one of the essentials to any serious and intelligent DVD collection.

0618680004|4.0|I should warn you that this review is as much about the book as Dawkins' impact with his arguments on me. If you're looking for a condemnation or affirmation of Dawkins' belief then this is the wrong review to read. I'm going to try and provide a fair balanced review of the book. I think this is a powerful, important and thought provoking book whether Dawkins is right or wrong.<br /><br />I'm agnostic and went to Catholic school most of my life. That shouldn't matter for the sake of a review but the information is provided for fair balance-I'm not sure God exists but I was taught that God DOES EXIST. Dawkins isn't sure God exists either. Dawkins argues that the evidence suggests there is no creator but we choose to believe in one because we have a hard time with the concept of existence without purpose, that existence of the universe continues after we are gone and because we (humanity) find ourselves to be the Rosencrantz & Guildenstern of universe. We cling to whatever slim and narrow hope we can because to not do so is too scary. It helps us retain our sanity in a world that can be nasty and unjust. It's the child in us that needs that reassurance just as a child needs the consistency and reassurance of their own personal \\"gods\\" (their parents). It also allows us to justify decisions that might not be ethical and moral otherwise.<br /><br />As Dawkins points out humanity uses religion to contribute to the root of evi. What Dawkins misses is that it isn't necessarily religion per se that creates the evil--it's just a justification used by people with less than ethical and moral agendas. That role belongs to (as does the good) humanity using religion or our differences (you could substitute politics for religion or any number of words)to commit atrocities. For religion is if nothing else a reflection of our moral and personal beliefs. It's used to justify what we do or don't do.<br /><br />Dawkins book is thought provoking. His arguments are logical, well thought out but as with any argument you can continue to prod and poke it until you find a weak spot or hole. Ultimately it's all a matter of...faith. Ironically an atheist has just as much \\"faith\\" as a Christian, Muslim or an adherent to any other religion. They \\"believe\\" that God doesn't exist. They believe that the universe just happened and that we may never know or understand (or be capable of understanding)why our universe came into being. Just as the person who is religious believes that we will never understand God's motivation in doing what he/she/it does.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I buy all of Dawkins' analogies or arguments but they bring up an important point; if there is no God and our lives here on Earth is all there is, it makes it even more important that we treat each other with compassion, care and warmth where we can. Because if this is all there is, than what we do, say and act on has long lasting ramifications. It makes life on Earth even more precious in my humble opinion. We should savor it and savor the experience of existence.<br /><br />My advice--read the book, weigh Dawkins arguments, raise your own arguments both for and against and make up your own mind. I agree with Carl Sagan's comment (which is quoted in Dawkins' book). You may lean one way or the other for Dawkins' point-of-view but I don't believe his book will necessarily convert you away from what you already believe.gument you can continue to prod and poke it until you find a weak spot or hole.

B000002UTI|5.0|When you buy the soundtrack to the DVD chronicling Lennon's life, you can expect to get the best when it comes to Lennon's music.  This includes about an equal mix of John's Beatles and solo tunes, which really allows for Lennon's best to come forward.  Notably, it starts out with \\"Real Love,\\" which began as a solo John track but later (in the 90's during anthology taping) got the full band treatment and became a Beatles tune.  I prefer this to \\"Free As A Bird,\\" and although I like both tunes, I'm glad they chose to include \\"Real Love\\" instead of \\"Free As A Bird.\\"  The sountrack continues starting with a cover song from his Beatle days, \\"Twist and Shout,\\" although one for which he was well known for his raucous singing. <br /> <br />Many of Lennon's hit original tunes from his Beatle days are predictably included here, with \\"Help!\\", \\"In My Life,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" \\"A Day In The Life,\\" \\"Revolution,\\" \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko,\\" \\"Julia,\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" all included.  These songs show off the many angles of John Lennon. <br /> <br />Then, several Plastic Ono Band and solo Lennon songs are included on the second half of the soundtrack.  \\"Give Peace A Chance,\\" \\"How?\\", \\"Imagine,\\" \\"God,\\" \\"Mother,\\" \\"Stand By Me,\\" \\"Jealous Guy,\\" \\"Woman,\\" \\"Beautiful Boy,\\" and \\"(Just Like) Starting Over,\\" are the tracks chosen from Lennon's solo years.  All of them are strong tracks.  \\"Imagine\\" is a rehearsal version, which gives a fresh look at the song by not including the version released on other Lennon CD's.  \\"Stand By Me\\" is, of course, a cover from his 'Rock 'n' Roll' album, a 1975 release that consisted of all cover songs from the good old days of Rock 'n' Roll.  Again, this selection of songs shows off the many sides of John Lennon. <br /> <br />Most importantly, 'Imagine' the soundtrack shows Lennon's superior songwriting ability and shows why he has attained such high status in rock music and music in general.  He had a knack for it, and he did it throughout his life.  If only his career had been allowed to continue, we would have even more material and more ingenious pop songs and pop records from Lennon.  Unfortunately, we must hold onto what we have and take from it what we may.  We must not wish for the impossible, and we must accept what we cannot change.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm an avid book reader so I know anytime a book I love is made into a movie, I will probably dislike some portion of it. You can never get everything from a book into a movie & books leave room for imagination. The reader will form a vision of the character in their minds, so when a fan of a writer or a particular novel finds the actor didn't fit that vision, they are unhappy. So I don't doubt that avid Austen readers will find problems with the movie.  <br /> <br />Looking at it purely from a movie objective. I loved it. I thought it was well acted and written. It very much reminded me of \\"Sense & Sensibility\\", which I also loved. I was fortunate, I guess you could say, that I have never read \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" so I was left in suspense as to whether Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth would ever be together. This certainly added to my pleasure of the movie. The movie allowed me to get to know all the characters. It definately drew out the romantic dreamer in me and I was crying at the end. I plan to read the book now, and I am sure I will have some opinions as to how the book compares to the movie, but for those that just love a good romantic movie.... watch it!
B0001KZM3O|1.0|Much as I normally like Pink Floyd, I hate this album. Maybe I'm the wrong person to be reviewing it, since it's opposed to World War II, and I feel WWII was the only conflict of the past century worth fighting. But even when judged on terms other than that, it's still a boring album, containing three (four, if you're counting the reissue) mucho overrated Floyd songs: the arena-rock excess of Not Now John, generally considered the album's high point; the dull ballad Your Possible Pasts, which tries (and fails) to inject interest with the soft/loud dynamics; the whiny Fletcher Memorial Home, and annoying dirge When the Tigers Broke Free. But that's not all: it doesn't get much worse than The Postwar Dream, unless you're talking about The Hero's Return or Paranoid Eyes, and there are a bunch of brief songs (Southampton Dock; Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert; One of the Few) that do little but move the plot along, and are of low quality. The meager highlight is the title song, with Gilmour taking a typically first-rate guitar solo; even then, the string arrangement's virtually the same as Comfortably Numb's. Waters unwisely takes vocals everywhere, and his voice is overly pinched and nasal, giving it a very whiny sound. I'd take Dark Side of the Moon; Wish You Were Here; Meddle; Animals or Piper at the Gates of Dawn over this any day.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|This is an intelligent, excellent satirical film, so don't get caught up in the title, for I think it can be misleading.  Smokers, for example, will likely suspect this film of being a vengeful attempt to make Big Tobacco look like Satan's most loyal servants, while anti-tobacco's attack dogs may suspect some hidden agenda to actually make smoking look cool.  Neither would be correct.  Thank You For Smoking launches its barbs into both sides of the tobacco conflict, shining a good bit of the harsh light of truth onto both.  No matter which side you're on, you can enjoy this brilliant little film.<br /><br />The sad fact is that the debate over smoking oftentimes has nothing to do with cigarettes; it's really all about money and power and politics.  Look at Al Gore, who could cry about the loss of his sister to cancer even as he profited from tobacco, or Bill Clinton (who did things with a cigar that even Big Tobacco would never condone), whose attack on Big Tobacco conveniently served him as a smokescreen to distract the public from his many personal problems.  Obviously, many people do oppose smoking for very sincere reasons, but some politicians jump on board merely as a means to power and influence.  In this movie, they're represented by Vermont's Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre (William H. Macy), who is leading the effort to put a large poison label on cigarettes.  He's not exactly all heart, though: berating his assistant for not choosing someone obviously on death's door for his \\"cancer boy,\\" lamenting the fact that one of his enemies didn't actually die after being attacked by anti-smoking vigilantes, and generally engaging in the same kind of self-profiting spin as the representatives of Big Tobacco.<br /><br />Finistirre's nemesis is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), the smooth-talking de facto spokesman for the tobacco industry.  Eckhart's brilliant performance keeps the film far away from the many pitfalls that would seem to dominate the landscape for this kind of satire.  Naylor is almost untouchably good at his job, able to deftly and quickly take a hostile crowd and win them over (or at least stave them off) with his defense of freedom and personal choice in America.  What does he do what he does?  That's never definitively answered, but paying the mortgage is alluded to by Nick and several other characters.  One thing that Nick alone has, however, is a human and sympathetic persona, as revealed in his relationship with his son.  The presence of the boy adds to the story's otherwise absurdist atmosphere, as we watch the boy look up to and begin to emulate his father's debating skills.  More than that, it shows us a human side to Nick, and that is something this film almost had to have in order to succeed.<br /><br />Nick's character is sort of morally ambivalent, but you can't help but like him - and he certainly comes off in a better light than Senator Finistirre and a certain reporter played (passably at best) by Katie Holmes.  Nick should have known better than to sleep with a journalist, as Heather Holloway goes about doing her job much the same way Nick goes about doing his.  Her only concern is the story and the attention it will bring her.  She and Finistirre, much more than Nick and his fellow spokesmen from the alcohol and firearms industries (who jokingly refer to themselves as the MOD [Merchants of Death] Squad and argue over which of their products is more deadly) are the real villains of the story.  Even if and when they might do the right thing, they do it for all the wrong reasons.  Nick may engineer good spin for Big Tobacco, but at least he doesn't pretend to be someone he isn't.<br /><br />The film features a surprisingly good cast (excepting Katie Holmes, of course, whose \\"steamy\\" scene with Eckhart is almost too far away from the camera to be seen with the naked eye), including the likes of Eckhart, Elliott, Macy, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, and - in a really funny cameo - Dennis Miller.  Jason Reitmanmay be a young filmmaker, but he really nailed just about every aspect of this film.  Making a film about Big Tobacco that never deviates from its satirical position to moralize either for or against smoking, skewers all concerned parties equally, defies the dangerous modern-day obsession with political correctness, and maintains a consistently intelligent, funny atmosphere throughout, is quite an accomplishment indeed.  Unless you simply can't take a joke (or you're the reviewer from the LA Times or some similar leftist rag), you're going to enjoy this movie.son Reitman may be a young filmmaker, but he really nailed just about every aspect of this film.

B000FVQM2Y|3.0|I thought this was a decent movie.  However, I did get the vague notion that this movie was supposed to be a subtle comedy.  After all, these are HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.  I laughed out loud at the scene in the vice principals office, as if a vice principal and a student would actually act the way they did.  The whole movie conjured up images of South Park for me, the absurdity of the situations.   <br /> <br />Strangely enough, this confusion kept me watching.  I just couldn't tell if this was supposed to be some dark commentary on being a teenager (if it did it totally sucks), or if it was supposed to be poking fun at the genre of films by casting the characters as high school students (which, if on purpose, was done brilliantly).
0312954468|4.0|Through the eyes of 'jack-of-all-trades' slave Taita, the reader is immersed in the culture and politics of ancient Egypt, and unless you're an Egyptologist, it won't matter if facts are historically accurate or not--it's a great book. I didn't mind the length, because the book is easy to read and action-packed. I was turned off by some of the gharish scenes of violence (the fate of Seth during the Festival of Osiris for one) and, because I'm a black person, was not too fond of descriptions of the Cush & Shilluk people as \\"black devils\\" and \\"savages\\" but then the author IS from South Africa afterall. Despite this I give the novel 4 stars since I had a hard time putting it down and I'm considering purchasing the sequel.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I work in the Emergency Department of a busy hosptial and you'd think that the last thing I'd want to do is watch a TV show about the exact same thing but that couldn't be farther from the truth.  Grey's Anatomy is very glamorous compared to any hospital but it lets you escape from the real world, even if it's only for a short while.<br /><br />This television series is one of the best dramas I've ever seen in a while. The cast has great chemistry, especially Patrick Dempsy and Ellen Pompeo. The script is flawless, full of new obstacles for each character to go through per episode, with bits of comedic writing in it as well. I have compared this series with the ER series and personally, I like this series much better. Grey's Anatomy has bits of life lessons for viewers to learn every so often. Many episodes breaks your hearts, making you feel tempted to even yell or shout at the television screen! Great cliff-hangers, making viewers waiting impatiently until next Thursday to see what happens next! Overall, Grey's Anatomy is a wonderful show. Tune in!<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say regarding Season One of Grey's Anatomy is that it was too short - in comparison to Season Two.
B000H5U832|4.0|Neither a car nor a sports fan, I can still experience the excitement and fuss over the race as depicted in the first 15 minutes of the film. The CG is so real that one can't tell the difference between the real thing in some of the scenes.    What fascinates me is the last hour when McQueen (Owen Wilson) reached Radiator Springs and bonded with the local folk. The scene is breathtaking, the story of the former glory well captured and things got interesting when Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) started to flex his muscles. All these made the final race in California more sentimental and much anticipated than ever. The message is clear, whether it will be heeded is another matter, but it is very worth telling.
0792833201|1.0|I become thoroughly disillusioned when misty swirls emanated from the TV. This film doesn't just have cheesy effects, it comes across as a parody of what it should have been. The family seemed pretty unconcerned about the unnatural occurrences. If chairs start moving by themselves across a room surely anyone would rush out and try and get professional help. At times I thought this could be a Disney production for kiddies. The acting was pretty lack-lustre. The strongest reactions I had to this film were disbelief that the producers could try to present such silly effects and also I had to laugh at the ineptitude of the acting. Thing is best categorised as a feeble comedy
0553573403|5.0|I first heard about this series from a friend.  Eager to begin the story, I asked to borrow A Game Of Thrones from him (he still hasn't gotten it back).  When I first began the book I was a little put-off by the changes of POV from chapter to chapter.  It was confusing to keep track of everything that was going on.  I was sure I was going to have to back track to remember everything.  Towards the middle of the book, however, I was so wrapped up in the story, no back tracking was necessary.  I realized right about then how fantastically GRRM was weaving the plot through each character.<br /><br />The characters aren't black and white either.  Each of the 'bad guys' are still human (well, save the Others, the zombies from the North), and they still love, and have emotions.  It goes the other way as well; the people readers are going to root for have their dark sides.  This multi-faceted character development kept me interested in what was going to happen to Ned Stark, and I still am trying to find out why Tyrion Lannister is so dang confusing (I've started the fourth book, and still don't know).  The Starks and the Lannisters are the main House rivalries.  Martin takes these rivalries to the next level by creating alliances, never seeming to skip a detail.  In King's Landing (where the King lives), especially, everyone seems to be working for all sides, so it is hard to tell who is really working for who, if they aren't just in it for themselves.<br /><br />Those details make for a brain engaging read that works both the logical and emotional sides of the reader.  I'm certain that every fantasy reader will enjoy GRRM's fresh, new twist on a genre that seems to have gone a little stale, and I wouldn't be surprised if he roped in a few newcomers.<br /><br />Time called Martin a modern-day Tolkien.  I whole-heartedly agree!
076790592X|5.0|I read this book quite some time ago, but it has left a lasting impression upon me. Makes one feel inspired to do more with their life while they still can. I heartily recommend this book!
0312323867|5.0|Something Blue was a pleasent surprise, I actually enjoyed it more than Something Borrowed. It was hard for me in the begining because I wasn't sure what I thought of reading through the eyes of Darcy, however I got into it very quickly. Its an easy and enjoyable read, and I definatly think it does justice to Something Borrowed. One shouldn't read one and not the other.
0312321376|5.0|Given my Lutheran upbringing, I've always been suspicious of claims of reincarnation.  These feelings have been eroded lately with my study of Buddhism and a news report that I saw where a four year old boy clearly demonstrated memories of life as a World War II fighter pilot.  As such, I was pleased to find this book.  It's not your typical new age psuedo-science hodge-podge of anecdotal accounts, but rather is a legitimate scientific examination of the possibility of reincarnation, explored through children's accounts of past lives, usually starting around the age of 2 or 3 and fading around 7 or 8.  Dr. Tucker has documented over 2,500 cases in countries all around the globe.  He examines different types of accounts and attempts to address the various explanations for each.<br /><br />While a book like this could come off about as exciting as reading the Yellow Pages, Dr. Tucker takes care to discuss interesting individual accounts in addition to explaining the results of his studies.  If you have an open mind concerning reincarnation, this book will raise your awareness and provide you with the information necessary to develop your own informed opinion.
B000DN6ZGC|4.0|I got interested in this artist when I saw her spot lighted as one of VH1's artist to watch. This ablum is verygood for a 1st and I enjoyed many of the songs. Corinne voice is very youthful and charming I find myself smiling when I listen to her singing, her voice reminds you of summer days and country drives. Yeah it sounds lame, but that the image it envokes for me. This ablum is a good buy and is very enjoyable.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I've struggled through old translations of Beowulf and happliy enjoyed the more reader-friendly version of Seamus Heaney, but I've always been on the lookout for a movie that could bring the book to life, without turing into one of the later Highlander movies.  This interpretation hit the mark wonderfully.  The cinematography is enchanting, the story line humanizes all of the characters and the performances are nuanced.  I didn't look at my watch a single time and by the end of the movie, I actually cared what happened to each character (which happens seldom in light of the products that Hollywood turns out).<br /><br />If you're looking for a good exploration of the central story of Beowulf, this movie is for you.  If you're interested in an examination of the interplay between Norse religion and Christianity around 500 A.D., this movie is for you.  If you want to feel like you're a part of a story that probes the nature of good and evil, duty and honor, revenge and reconcilliation, this movie is for you.  If you just want some sort of sword and sorcery slash-fest, pass it up.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|Seventh Sojourn is the seventh Moodies album with Justin Hayward and John Lodge. It was first released on November 10, 1972 on Threshold Records and is considered the last of the &#34;Classic 7&#34; albums. Recording sessions for the album began in January and then again from May to September at Decca Tollington Park Studios in London. The band had been burning the candle at both ends with extensive recording and touring, opened it's own record company Threshold Records, it's own chain of record stores also called Threshold. Fatigue was beginning to set in and the recording sessions took much longer than expected. This would end up being the last Moodies album for six years. As far as the album itself, every song is great although I find a bit subdued in spots. This really is a perfect Sunday afternoon listening album.
0060853980|3.0|Good Omens is one of those books that just looks like it would be good.  It's written by a couple of big name fantasy authors, it has a sly sense of humor reminiscent of Douglas Adams and the Hitchhiker books and it pokes fun at a topic that is always ready for a little teasing, namely the Apocalypse.  In this case, however, the whole is not greater than the sum of the parts; while not a bad book, Good Omens is also somewhat lacking. <br /> <br />The tale involves the beginning of the End, triggered by the appearance of the Antichrist.  Unfortunately, the switching at birth - which has more than a faint resemblance to The Omen - is botched, and the son of the Devil winds up with the wrong family.  As a result, this child - named Adam Young - doesn't get the proper tutelage in evil, something that is essential for the scheduled end of the world eleven years later. <br /> <br />While Adam lives a more or less normal child's life with a mere inkling about his powers, the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley decide that they really don't like the idea of an Apocalypse.  In their own ways, they've been enjoying life among the mortals and have also become friendly enemies with each other.  While they, among others (including witches) try to avert the ultimate disaster, the Four Horsemen gather steam and start triggering Armageddon. <br /> <br />This could have been a great book, but there is something in it that doesn't work.  It could be a lack of focus or it could just be that two authors collaborating are not better than each solo.  I can't really pinpoint exactly why this book didn't impress me, except to say it didn't.  You've probably encountered it too:  a book or movie or album that has all the components of greatness without achieving it.  That is Good Omens:  mildly entertaining with a laugh here and there, but otherwise sadly strictly average. <br />
B0000640VO|5.0|I don't enjoy reading subtitles.  I generally don't like French culture.  Even so, this is one of my favorite films (which is testament to how good this film really is...or maybe it's just time for me to re-evaluate my judgment on French culture).  It's refreshing to watch a high quality film that's obviously not a product of a Hollywood studio.  I had to watch Amelie several times to catch all the director's visual subtleties which I missed while reading subtitles.  At its core Amelie is a love story.  But its theme is more complex.  Like the Beatles white album line: \\"In the end the love you take is equal to the love you make\\", Amelie sprinkles her special kind of love all over Paris and unwittingly embarks on her own emotional rollercoaster.  I hope see more French films of this quality.
1932907009|1.0|This had to be one of the worst screenwriting books I've ever read.  I think Blake Snyder must be, personally, writing all of the reviews.  Save The Cat! was just too paint-by-the-numbers to be helpful.  If you need more proof of how bad the book is just look at Snyder's produced writing credits:  Blank Check and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.  It would be hard to come up with a worse pair of movies.
0393061434|4.0|Though written in a manner not usually seen, the lighthearted and innocent view of how he had envisioned events from the start is refreshing. Usually books from leaders in their class are used for motivation and inspiration for my team, in this case, I will use it for my children so they can understand what ones potential and creative thinking can do for them. This book is a keeper.
0007189958|5.0|THIS BOOK IS THE SAME AS ROSSIE DUNNE AND LOVE, ROSIE!!!  They need to stop publishing this book under different names- it's annoying!
B00003CWL6|5.0|An excellent parody for the neurotic and borderline lifestyle of many people in the modern times (not only of Americans).  A wealth of personality traits and psychosocial responses in one single movie. For those knowledgeable in psychology, it must be a fascinating experience to watch this movie, and to find out how perfectly it correlates with the troubled lifes of many individuals living in the \\"civilized world\\" and particularly in high developed societies. (Read the DSM IV and find out for yourself)   A superb production, well worth seeing more than once, with an open mind, of course!
0316779989|3.0|Holidays on Ice is a book of short stories written by the very funny writer David Sedaris.  Unfortunately, with the exception of the first story, these aren't that funny. <br /> <br />SantaLand Diaries recounts the author's experience as an elf working for Macy's during the Christmas season.  His dry wit and excellent insight into the annoying holiday shopper make for a highly entertaining and occasionally laugh out loud chapter 1.   <br /> <br />Season's Greetings to all our Friends and Family starts off promising enough.  It is in the form of a family letter sent out to everyone the family knows that recounts the family's happenings for the past year.  Everyone gets at least one of these each year and most people roll their eyes as they read it and mock the family that sent it.  However this letter goes on and on for entirely too long and has a dark, twisted content that stops being humorous and becomes confusing and sad. <br /> <br />Dinah the Christmas Whore has a promising enough subject, but doesn't wind up being particularly funny or entertaining.  Beth, David's sister, works with a woman who in addition to being a prostitute at night, trends toward extremely unsavory clients.  Beth gets a frantic call from Dinah when she is beaten up by one of her regulars and the Sedaris family takes her in for the night.  David tells the story from the point of view of the confused child who is surprised by the reaction to Dinah from the rest of his family.  But the story never leaves the realm of odd into the world of entertaining. <br /> <br />The remaining three stories are dark and fairly humorless.  There is a sense of irony in some when the author illustrates how out of touch with the season people are - the very same people that think they are in the throws of the Christmas spirit.  But somehow the writing misses the mark, isn't funny, and borders on depressing.  Me Talk Pretty One Day set the bar high for me as a fan of David Sedaris and I haven't been satisfied since.  This isn't terrible, but not what I was hoping for either.  You may want to simply read the first story and then put the book back on the shelf.
B00000K0DT|4.0|I was at a friend's house, and he decided to put this movie on.  Most of the movies he has put on in the past haven't excited me very much, so I was very critical from the start.<br /><br />However, The Usual Suspects proved to be quite watchable, and I wouldn't mind watching it again.  Unfortunately, since there's a kind of plot twist at the end of the movie, there's not much I can say in my review without ruining the plot for everybody.  It's best watched when the audience has no idea of what's going to happen.  In fact, since I told you there's a twist to begin with, I've ruined the movie for you already.  So just go ahead and give my review an unhelpful vote right now.<br /><br />But, then again, I've seen the plot twist - and I still feel I could enjoy the movie a second time even though I already know what's going to happen.  I guess The Usual Suspects is just a good movie regardless.
B000IY03CS|3.0|Between George Michael's last greatest hits collection and this collection, he only released 2 albums, \\"Songs From The Last Century\\" and \\"Patience.\\" To celebrate 25 years of his career including his Wham! days, this collection includes some Wham! tracks.    If you have all George Michael's past releases like me, new tracks you will hear are:  An Easier Affair (released as a single earlier)  This Is Not Real Love (also released as a single)  Understand  Heal The Pain (re-recorded with Paul McCartney)  Brother Can You Spare a Dime (Live performance)    Unfortunately, these new tracks are rather bland and forgettable.  It's as if he ran out of creative juice, lyrics are way too simple.  Duet with Paul McCartney absolutely butchered this beautiful song which showcased how delicate and beautiful George's voice is.  Brother Can you Spare a Dime was actually breathtaking.  Arrangement was almost identical as the track on \\"Songs From...,\\" but it shows that he is an amazing live performer.    Now to the confusing part...  Not a single song from Wham! first album, \\"Fantastic\\" is featured in this collection.  Why???  Some of Wham! signature tracks are missing in my humble opinion.  Songs that should've been included from Wham! are: \\"Wham! Rap,\\" \\"Young Guns\\" and \\"I'm Your Man.\\"    Even more confusing, some major hit singles (at least in the US) are missing in here. \\"I Want Your Sex,\\" \\"Monkey,\\" and \\"Kissing a Fool\\" from mega hit album, \\"Faith.\\" Plus other important tracks like \\"I Knew You Were Waiting,\\" \\"Waiting For That Day,\\" \\"Cowboys and Angels,\\" and \\"Star People 97\\" are missing...    An additional disc named \\"For The Loyal\\" was even more frustrating.    7 out of 15 tracks are from \\"Patience.\\" 3 tracks from \\"Songs From...\\"   I think this collection could've been much much better.  I mean any song other than \\"American Angel\\" would be a good choice.    I described \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" as a good George Michael sampler.  \\"Twentyfive\\" hardly qualifies as one.  In fact, I feel that \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" is much more cohesive than this collection.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|Think about how much money was spent on the special effects for this gruesome movie.  You know, I've worked in the funeral business where I've seen real-life gore, and trust me, it's not fun to see.  I guess I just never understood the demand for lots of gore in films.<br /><br />Now that doesn't mean you can't make a good movie with gore and stuff in it.  Red Dragon is a good movie with lots of gore.  Unfortunately, Blade II just isn't a good movie.  It's nothing but vampires getting killed over, and over, and over again.  The plot never advances beyond vampires being slaughtered for a good hour and thirty minutes.  Doesn't matter that it has lost its shock value after the first five killings.  I was thinking the concept of horror films was to put characters in new frightening situations that they haven't yet adapted to so the shock value could carry on.  I mean, it doesn't take us 80 minutes to figure out that Blade can kill vampires.  And man, the effects are disgusting.  I'd rather watch the four most boring Dragnet episodes ever back-to-back than go through another viewing of this.
B000093BDX|5.0|I've been a Beach Boys fan since the mid-1970's & was fortunate enough to see them in concert during the summer of 2000-This CD,in my opinion,is a fairly comprehensive overview of their best work-However,I wish \\"Caroline No\\" had been included-That's my favorite Brian Wilson composition-In any event,this is a winner from start to finish.
0743289412|4.0|This was a great book from Stephen King.  It didn't move as fast as I'd hoped it would, but it was still enthralling.  Lisey was easy to get attached to.  She's easily relatable from a women's standpoint.  King has an uncanny gift for portraying a woman's inner thoughts and actions.  I'm a female writer and find it so difficult to wrap my mind around a man's point of view!  I also enjoyed King's use of made-up words and his description of the inner workings of marriages and families.  I gave this book 3-1/2 stars because it was good, but I've read better from him.  The only Stephen King book that I thought was a \\"bomb\\" was The Regulators, published under his pseudonym of Richard Bachman, I never did finish that one after two attempts.  This book is a five star'er compared to that one.  Overall this was a great book and I'm always in awe at how King's writing flows so uniquely and easily, I'm jealous!

B00062PN6I|4.0|I bought 2 sets of these headphones for my portable DVD player when travelling on a plane. They block out the external noises so that you can hear the DVD sound. My only gripe is the 1/4 inch plug that comes with the headphones, requiring the purchase of an adaptor from Radioshack to fit the headphone socket from my DVD player.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Here for once you have Hollywood hard at work rather than hardly working, and a present day glimpse at what \\"screen magic\\" used to be.  Perhaps the placement of a story during Hollywood's golden era helped.  But what a convergence of planets -- writers avoiding knee-jerk political correctness despite the mammoth temptation of Howard Hughes at center, Leonardo DeCapio performing as a top-notch, intelligent actor and not a sneering boy, Martin Scorsese just being an honest tradesman.  That plus mid-century 20 razzle-dazzle, an edgy sort of heroism, and the wild card of a tough lesson in obsessive-compulsive disorder adds up to a movie that will certainly last, long after Titanic has sunk again and the gratuitous sadism of Casino has been properly relegated to the smell-o-vision pile.  Bravo!<br /><br />See it on as big a screen as possible.  You will meet, best as he can be recreated for you, a complex and driven creator named Howard Hughes who attempted to do more with his life than simply rest on the $$$ he was born with.  Warts and all but funny too.  As for the rest of the cast, no extras here -- the recreation of Ava Garner was particularly smashing and unexpected.<br /><br />Despite having lived through the era and read all the Life magazines & other news junk about Hughes' last days in my teens, the movie taught me I knew nothing at all worth knowing about him.  I had sat down just expecting a typical Hollywood stroll through big sets, snazzy clothes, all that jazz.  I can count on one hand films that were actually an advanced learning experience, and I have seen dumpsters full of them in 55 years.  But this is not only not one of those clunkers, but also close to the top.
B000IU3XU6|3.0|I am a voice person, I both perform singing and have been teaching for years.  I have been a Josh Groban fanatic ever since his first CD, and I have been hungry for his latest one to come out.  I admit there are many things on the CD I like: Josh's general style and choice of music, but I am concerned after listening to this CD several times that Josh seems to be \\"straining\\" his voice for the first time.  Several of the songs seem to be pushing the limits of his comfortable range, and I could be wrong but it seems like he is trying to make a more \\"pop\\" sound.  I hope not.  This would be a grave mistake and lead his beautiful voice down the road of many others who were seduced by the dark side. . .  Josh take care of your beautiful voice!!  Don't listen to anybody but yourself!  Sigh. . . Here's hoping for more great Josh CDs. . .
0786915749|4.0|After reading over some of the most rediculous reviews, I had to sit back and laugh. OF COURSE it sounds like Lord of the Rings. Why shouldn't it? Just about every fantasy novel ever released was a drop-off of another fantasy novel (Trust me, I must had read over 100 epic fantasy novels, ranging from Terry Brooks to Mercedes Lackey). Even Tolkien got some of his ideals from somebody else, have you ever read one of the old epic poems of dwarves, and found that all the dwarves names in The Hobbit, were exackly named? Please people, before you block heads review this book and toatlly blow it off the charts, stop and think first.<br />This is the first novel Maragret Weis and Tracy Hickman wrote together. Do you THINK it would be perfect? Of course not. Every author's first work sounds immature. Take Palolini or Stephen King for example. There first books may sound a little choppy and sometimes 'over-done', but that's where there best works come from. It's hard to find stand-alone fantasy novels these days. The only series I found so far was The Symphony of Ages by Elizabeth Haydon. (Rhapsody, Prohecy, Destiny, Requiem for the Sun, Elegy for a Lost Star, and The Assassin King).<br />When you read more Dragonlance novels (Legends, Second Generation, Dragons of Summer Flame, and War of Souls) you can see that they had improved and gone to there own style of writing. The novels are defintly darker and more realistic. Dragons of Autumn Twilight is a YES for anybody starting to read Dragonlance, or fantasy in peticular. Tanis and Raistlin make the story more interesting, while Tas makes it fun and laughable. And by the way, Kender are NOT Hobbits, or like them. While Hobbits are non-adventurus, Kenders love to go out and explore. So please, give some respect that these people bothered to sit down and write a novel together. And if it wasn't for Maragaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, Dragonlance wouldn't be what it is today.
1401308201|4.0|The first time I saw this book was in the lobby of the theatre where I saw the musical \\"Wicked.\\" I was so enthralled with the show and the book looked so unbelievably cool that I almost bought it then and there...but I stopped myself, because they were selling it for more than $50, which is INSANE! I had a feeling I could find it much cheaper somewhere else, so I dropped about 1,000 hints to my husband that he should order \\"The Grimmerie\\" for me from Amazon.com, and he finally did! Yay!<br /><br />\\"Wicked\\" is my favorite musical of all time, and \\"The Grimmerie\\" is the best book about an individual Broadway show that I've ever seen. In addition to many full-color photos and behind-the-scenes details about the production, this book features lengthy interviews with all the creative talents who collaborated on the show, from Gregory Maguire to Steven Schwartz to Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel.<br /><br />There are a few things that would have made this compilation even better. Although \\"The Grimmerie\\" contains a condensed libretto that features the lyrics to all the songs from the musical, it would be nice if they'd included all the dialogue, too. Also, \\"Wicked\\" is a global sensation that has spawned numerous touring and permanent productions, but the book doesn't go into detail about that at all. Since this musical revitalized the theatre industry all over the world, you'd think the book would at least acknowledge that fact. I mentioned that there are a lot of photos in the book, and there are, but I think there could have been a few more, especially since \\"The Grimmerie\\" is lacking in a few other areas, but oh well.<br /><br />In spite of a few shortcomings, \\"The Grimmerie\\" is a must-have for any \\"Wicked\\" fan. I enjoyed reading this book with the \\"Wicked\\" soundtrack playing in the background!

Scott Kelby wrote this book in a very user friendly manner.  His humorous banter through out the book make the reading very enjoyable.

B00005JPE7|5.0|We just saw this and it's a terrific film; well-written, well-acted, and well-filmed.  It's inspiring, but more than that, it's *real*.  The final 'Rocky' easily measures up to the original movie, and we'll certainly be recommending it to family and friends.  Sly Stallone has given us a winner with this one, and it's probably worth seeing on the big screen more than once.

B000F1IQN2|3.0|This movie is inspired by real events, but is a work of fiction. From the book Vengeance and history we only know that terrorists killed the Israel Olympians in Munich and the people who were claimed to be associated with Black September were later killed.  <br /> <br />In this movie Spielberg weaves a story around those two basic facts that give us an intense story line of the secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and assassinate all eleven Palestinians to have planned the 1972 Munich massacre of eleven Israeli athletes. The director seems to focus on the personal toll this mission of revenge takes on the team and the man who led it.  <br /> <br />My brother had worked as a volunteer at those Olympics so we were close to the tragedy. And it was a horrible tragedy. But knowing of the Mossad, I doubt this is realistic. Also I doubt their chosen agents would be this incompetent. And the sex scenes in the movie serve no purpose as is stated elsewhere. Other then that it is an OK action film. The topic of terrorism and retaliation is as relevant today as it was in 1972. <br />
B000IAXVH6|5.0|Shore Leave is one of the best episodes<br /><br />of the classic series. It uses all the<br /><br />sci fi props but also has a great story,<br /><br />if you don't even care about Star Trek<br /><br />and have to watch one, watch this one.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars Season 1 was such a great purchase for me.  I bought it, having only seen one episode of Veronica Mars, and I watched it from the beginning.  But once I watched one I couldn't stop, coz it was so addictive! The plot line is unique and interesting, and overall it is such a great show..it really doesn't get enough credit.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|They really did a good job with the video on this. So much clearer and better looking then my old vcrtape. Bonus extras are nice too.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I liked a few songs enough to give it three stars but the rest not so great.  Maybe I was a little too excited for it to come out so I had really high expectations, but know Amy Lee is way better. <br />It was ok.  I listen to it every once in a while. <br />-Liz
B00005JPBP|4.0|If you are a fan of Steam Punk (Verne-Wells Victorian Sci-Fi, \\"The Wild, Wild, West\\"), or love the edgier episodes of \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" then you will love the movie.<br /><br />It is essentially a psychodrama about a rivalry and obsession that goes out of control.  The distinct difference is that this is a Steam Punk Victorian Era, which is only revealed at the end of the movie, and various Christophers associated with this project (writer, director) used the rivalry of magicians as the friction-point.<br /><br />About one-third of the way through, my heart was broken because I could tell there were no heroes in the move. This is a credit to all involved, since it illustrates the point that obsession, rivalry, and revenge are like an oil slick: everyone is left greasy and dirty.  Even the mentors who should have known better are dingy.<br /><br />Additionally, the non-linear flashback/flash forward added to the theme.  What we see is one odd lump of humanity. Again, this lumpiness reminds us of the sad results of obsession, rivalry, and revenge.<br /><br />I do have one criticism.  Tesla was portrayed as being cautious toward science.  This is inaccurate.  Even at this stage in his life, he still had a burning passion for science. His autobiography begins with these words, \\"The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.\\"<br /><br />Read \\"Tesla: Man Out Of Time\\" for a more accurate description of the Wizard of Colorado Springs.<br /><br />Note: The ending almost left with a feeling of deus ex machine, but after reviewing this film--it is shuffled like \\"Citizen Kane\\"--I realized there were enough clues and proper set up for the semi-surprise ending.<br /><br />PS--and yes, seeing Wolverine, Batman, Gollum, and Ziggy Stardust in one film makes it worth seeing.ling of deus ex machine, but after reviewing this film--it is shuffled like \\"Citizen Kane\\"--I realized there were enough clues and proper set up for the semi-surprise ending.    PS--and yes, seeing Wolverine, Batman, Gollum, and Ziggy Stardust in one film makes it worth seeing.
B000009QO6|5.0|It's laughable that among all of Amazon's vast inventory they do not have a single Danzig cd. Go to Best Buy's website or walk into any retail store that holds music and pick it up for 11 bucks. 35 dollars and another for 500!?!, both are equally hella ridiculas!
B0002IQEHI|5.0|I first learned of this film 20 some odd years ago in an undergrad film studies class.  Since then I have watched it repeatedly, and it only gets better with age.  Cary Grant is his usual suave, drop dead gorgeous self, but is almost playing a parody of the \\"Cary Grant\\" type.  The sexual innuendos, slightly lost to me then, are steamier than ever.  Today's filmmakers could learn so much from this masterpiece.  The greatest part of North by Northwest, however, is the trademark Hitchcockian suspense.  No matter how many times I have seen this film, it still brings me to the edge of my seat!
B000BM3ZUE|5.0|They really did justice to this recording with the remastering. I can hear all kinds of instruments and sounds that have been brought out of the mix that I never heard on my old recording. Very clear sound and excellent seperation of instruments.
B00005JP9V|4.0|Clive Owen plays Theo, a man that has to help an illegal immigrant.  What he finds out is that this young woman is pregnant.  The first pregnancy in 18 years.  We don't find out exactly why women stopped being able to give birth but this movie does not explain a lot of things.  You would think it would go into what people are going through knowing that human life will not exist soon.  Well it doesn't show you that because you can imagine what people are going through with 18 years of no childbirth, and the women crying at the beginning of the movie because of their fascination of the youngest person in the world being dead explains enough.  Don't expect this futuristic world to have space ships and all kinds of imaginative new technology, expecting anything but grimness will only lead to dissapointment.<br /><br />The explosions were by far my favorite part of the movie.  Though set 20 years in the future, it is as good of a depiction you will ever get of guns and their devastating effects.  As commented before there are some parts where the director does not say cut after explosions go off.  Be prepared for some of the most amazing realistic action scenes you will ever see.<br /><br />Michael Caine was very funny in his limited role and his friend Sid is just as hilarious.  The whole cast was very good.  Don't go into this expecting it to be a great movie but it is quite good and may surprise you.
B00005MP58|3.0|I realize that this movie was made for those who have not read the book, or who have not read it over 20 times, and if one is only superficially acquainted with the book this would be a good movie.  I found many of the characters turned into over-the-top caricatures of themselves, and all the subtlety and nuances of the book missing.  I think the old BBC production handled Austen's work much better.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is an album that I had downloaded ages ago (illegally), and when I listened to it, I rather enjoyed it, but not enough at the time I thought to buy.  The first song on the album (Hung Up) is a seriously big hook. That was the song that had an Abba sample in it, and wow did it hook me. In fact, I had previously bought that single off of iTunes when it was just a single, before the actual album came out.<br /><br />Speaking of samples, when I had downloaded it illegally, track 2 (Get Together) started off with the sound of clocks ringing that sounded suspiciously like the same sound from the beginning of Time from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. The legit version I bought doesn't have that sound effect in it. I wonder if she was forced to remove the sound effect by Floyd's people?<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this album, and as I was listening to it again recently it occurred to me just how much I had been listening to it, and \\"went legit\\", and bought the full album.<br /><br />For a guy who is the webmaster for Black Sabbath, I always find myself amazed that I enjoy as much of Madonna's music as I do. Also, here is the music video for Hung Up. Album's good if you like dance music, or like Madonna. Worth it.<br /><br />Will go well in my collection of Black Sabbath & Ozzy records.  ;)
0307237699|4.0|Before I begin my book review, let me say this: While I do lean to the left politically, I do not support Obama for Presidency.  I am not going to discuss why.  Thus, unlike 80% of the reviews for this book, mine isn't driven by a love for the GOP, or my own push to make Obama the next President.  Thus, here is my review ON THE BOOK ITSELF: <br /> <br />The Audacity of Hope is divided into well themed out chapters, such as Faith, Family, Opportunity, how they effect, or have been effected by politics, and thus can be read as separate essays if need be.  While I'm sure that everyone has their favorite chapters, mine are \\"Politics\\" and \\"Our Constituation.\\"   <br /> <br />In the Politics chapter, Obama does a wonderful job of giving the reader insight into what a Senator actually does, how they spend their time, the feelings when first elected, and where they should live in DC (well, not literally).  The point is, Obama actually communicates the idea that Senators are human, and they go to work everyday just like the rest of us.  This chapter made me realize that the politician talking heads you see on television who seem to be reciting some list of talking points, deep down, are actually real people. What is also refreshing is his honest portrayal of Senator voting.  Obama makes the point that since Senators vote so often on so many laws with complexities and irrelevant clauses, every Senator's record (Republican, Democrat, or hopefully Libertarian...sigh) can be construed as having contradictions...or \\"flip flops\\" as the political marketing people from every party who constantly insult the intelligence of the American people say. <br /> <br />The chapter covering the Constitution is perhaps something that was covered to death for graduate students American History or Law.  But for the rest of us, Obama's arguments on interpreting the Constitution are eye opening.  If you find yourself at Border's, and are looking to kill some time, find this book and read this chapter.  I can see why he probably was a great law professor. <br /> <br />In summary, I do recommend this book.  I like how it is structured, and I think Obama's points are well presented.  I will also say that I love Obama as an author.  As for my opinion of Obama as a politician, well, I won't include it here because Amazon Book reviews ARE NOT FOR POLITICAL DEBATE, THEY ARE FOR...pay attention here...REVIEWING BOOKS!
B000J10ERO|5.0|The thought of anyone but Christopher Reeve ever playing the role of the Man of Steel was out of the question... until I saw \\"Superman Returns\\". Brandon Routh may look too young for the role, but he portrayed Superman with integrity while remaining true to the character we all knew and loved from the original movie. He even had some of the same facial expressions, both as Supes and Clark Kent, that Chris Reeve had. I really felt like I just picked up where the \\"Superman II\\" movie had left off. Kevin SPacey's \\"Lex Luthor\\" was much more believable than Gene Hackmans, and much less campy. Yet, he looked so much like Gene that (again) I felt like they were the same person. All the cast did superb performances, and the fact that they focused a little more on establishing relationships made it perfect even for someone who never saw \\"Superman the Movie\\". The tag line \\"You'll believe a man can fly... again\\" should have been on every poster. And the second disc has so much more to add to the whole experience, both in deleted scenes and behind-the-scene scenes. A movie well worth watching for any Superman fan, and even Batman fans will enjoy it.
0316776963|1.0|Someone at the book store suggested this book to me as a Christmas present for my teenage boys. I gave it to them, but just after the holidays I picked it up to read it first. By page ten it is very clear to me that this book is not appropriate reading for my teen boys. Flipping further into the book only confirmed my opinion. It is going into the trash.
6305127697|5.0|Good twisty plot fueled by smart production and superb performances by all characters. Gere has seldom been better. Linney and Norton were outstanding.
0131479415|5.0|A lot of books on agile do a lot 'talk the talk' and fall short on 'walk the talk'. This book is rich from practical standpoint and is indispensable for all interested professionals especially if you have the hard job of selling agile development to your management.<br /><br />Mike Kohn, as the author, is simply a master in teaching 'how to' behind whole agile development methodology. He does not take any fancy to any one methodology ( be it XP or SCRUM or Crystal) but drives towards an unified view of the principles and delivers practices that can be put to use directly.<br /><br />Agile does not ignore planning. It just advocates adaptive planning and execution. Knowing the fact that you can only foresee to the extent, it provides a formula for how often to plan, how to refine, how to setup a release plan, how to engage the team and whole gamut of release management from agile standpoint.<br /><br />One book that should be read before jumping on agile bandwagon and before putting 'pedal to the metal'.<br /><br />The book is one of the finest books on agile in a world that has been flooded with many books on the subject. This stands out as a real jewel.<br /><br />A case study, which mimics a real organization trying to adopt agile methodology, drives home many subtle points very effectively. This case study runs from beginning to the end and illustrates complete life cycle of the product development.
B000005JAX|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD!!  I would highly recommend it to everyone.  My only wish is that it had more songs.
B000J10EQU|3.0|Superman Returns is set in the same world of Christopher Reeves' Superman. It is a continuation from the previous movies. (This is unlike Batman Begins which completely rebooted the Batman series.) There are good and bad parts about this movie.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />For one I think Brandon Routh did a great job playing Superman. He sounded and looked like Reeves. Parker Posey was very funny as Lex Luthor's sidekick. The cinematography and effects were decent.  The movie paid homage to the original movie like the beginning credits. The original John Williams Superman theme song was used throughout the movie. Overall, the movie was entertaining enough to recommend.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She just didn't impress me. Margot Kidder was a lot better and more likable. Also, I didn't care for Spacey as Lex Luthor. I thought he was not as funny as Gene Hackman. I also was expecting more from the movie itself. I thought Bryan Singer who directed the first two X-Men would deliver the best Superman movie. I hoped Superman Returns would be to Superman what Batman Begins was to Batman. This was not the case. Singer says he was just establishing the characters in this one and he will go \\"Wrath of Kahn\\" on the next one.
B000J103YI|5.0|Great movie, Great Soundtrack and Sexy Ladies. What more could you ask for? Jennifer is awesome. Beyonce is stunning. But I'm putting my bid in for Anika Noni Rose. Shorty is bangin! Sharon Leal formerly of Boston Public is fine too! <br /> <br />Gotta give props to Eddie Murphy, dude came back hard!
B000JK8OYU|2.0|The first CD set I received had a blank 2nd disc.  I sent it back for replacement and the 2nd disc on the replacement is also blank.  Obviously a bad batch.  Amazon isn't going to replace this one for me but will issue a credit.
B000001ZS3|5.0|This album is simply impressive, after all those years, it doesn't sound old at all.  You could easily imagine that it has been release recently and that would still make sense.  Great music, from future times ! <br />A classic.
B000066SBB|5.0|I came across this looking for a birthday gift for my mother. I was having really hard time trying to think of something. Seeing as her birthday is on Christmas Eve, then had to think of something to give to her for Christmas. These cd's where perfect!!  <br /> <br /> My mom always talks about the music she used to listen, but she doesn't even have a cassettee tape or even a vinyl record of any of the music she listened to from her childhood through her adulthood. Giving her these cd's was the best idea every. She actually cried!!!! My mom told me listening to these songs, she could remeber who she was with, where she was, and what she was wearing, when she heards the songs that Aretha sang. <br /> <br />The price was great, considering you got two cd's. And they deliveried the day before her birthday. <br /> <br />So, if your looking for a gift to give someone, who always talks about the music they used to listen to, but they don't have any of it, and they love Aretha Franklin. This is the perfect gift.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A real eye opener. Good factual evidence of a epic issue with disasterous consiquences.
B000002HJD|4.0|The only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is Lament (which is pretty adolescent, to be quite honest). Spoken word from JDM with really good accompaniment from the rest of The Doors. Not surprisingly, the two work really well together.
B000001ZS4|4.0|This album is as great as Oxygene.  In my opinion, these are two of the best album in electronic music.  As another reviewer said, close your eyes, don't let be disturbed by anything and fly far away from here.
B000I2JKE2|4.0|I really enjoyed Richard Donner's version of Superman II. I think it is a lot better than the Theatrical version and storywise it is better than Superman Returns. It is a must see for every Superman fan.
B000ILYYJE|3.0|Being a surround sound audiophile it was with great excitement that I purchased this box set. <br /> <br />I LOVE CLASSIC ROCK ALBUMS RE-MIXED IN 5.1 and have quite a few in my collection in both DVD-A and SACD formats, with the DVD-A version of  <br />\\"L.A. Woman\\"(released in 2000 and also remixed by Bruce Botnick)) being one of my favourites. Listening to the title track on this mix, where Morrison keeps repeating \\"Mr Mojo Rising\\", is like having him running to each corner of your room each time he sings it. <br /> <br />The 5.1 mix of this set is, in my humble opinion, very disappointing. <br /> <br />I would call it more of a 3.5.1 mix. Whilst the clarity coming from the front speakers is excellent, there is only the occasional \\"grab\\" and/or echo coming out of the rear speakers. I did notice that, as I progressed through the albums (I listened to them in release date order) the mix did improve but was still disappointing. <br /> <br />When I compare this mix to, say, the SACD releases of Elton John's early albums, the Elton John albums are far superior. The 5.1 mix of these are very distinct and wide. <br /> <br />I guess it all comes down to the producer's interpretation of a 5.1 mix. Perhaps Bruce Botnick and the remaining Doors felt that the mixes should be more discreit and respecting the original sound. <br /> <br />If so, I don't agree. 5.1 surround mixes are meant to make old classic rock albums sound fresh and new again. You want to hear instruments and sounds that were buried in the original mix(examples, Elton John's SACDs, Deep Purple's \\"Machine Head\\" DVD-A, Mike Oldfield's \\"Tubular Bells\\" SACD to name just a few). <br /> <br />If you are someone who isn't into 5.1 surround mixes then you will find the sound of this box set excellent. <br /> <br />However, if you are buying it purely for the 5.1 mixes, as Mike S. said in his review, the sound is not as good as you might think.
B00005QB42|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing someone else play it.  It is absolutely wonderful.  The first couple of tracks are great for deep relaxation and the rest is wonderful for doing Asanas.  One of the best cd's Iv'e come across.  I highly recommend it.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|It is the best DVD I have purchased this last year!  All my friends love it too.  Thank you.
B000002UR7|5.0|Personally, i enjoy listening to this album. I dont care what you think, i dont care what the masses think, i just dont care. Listen to the album, dont read all these stupid reviews. If you like Radiohead just listen and have your own opinion. just because a lot of people dont like it, doesnt mean you wont, their opinion isnt worth jack. alright, i said what i had to haha. <br /> <br />p.s: Anyone Can Play Guitar is a great song!
B000002AP1|1.0|This is garbage because of one thing ... the production and mix are truly awful. It sounds like you are listening to this through a transister radio, underwater and 100 yards away. It was purposely recorded that way.<br /><br />This is 3 chord rock and there is nothing special about them. With other punk/garage bands, you heard the same chord progressions and time signatures infinite times but with better recordings.<br /><br />I like some of Iggy Pop's material but I do not get it with this one. I know that this is regarded as a classic by a lot of critics I just don't get it.<br /><br />You should stay away because I cannot imagine anybody having repeated listenings of this.
0670034711|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I found it by accident while browsing for something else.  Once I read the description, I knew I had to have it.  I am not a big reader but could not put this one down.  I only wish she'd write a Part 2 because when I finished it I wanted more!
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I enjoyed this album.  It's pleasant and it's typical Enya.
B000CNE092|5.0|Without a doubt my favourite animated film and suprisingly it is not made by Disney but Fox Pictures. <br /> <br />Although it does not follow the factual history of what happened to Anastasia Romanov and her family it is a heart warming tale of courage, love and a quest to find something that was lost but eventually found. <br /> <br />The voice talents throughout the film include those of John Cusack, Meg Ryan and Kirsten Dunst. <br /> <br />With this double disc edition it also features 'The Sequel' Bartok The Magnificent but buyers beware this does not centre around Anastasia at all it is quite a poor attempt at a children's film not that you could expect greatness from a direct to video animated feature. <br /> <br />So if viewers want to buy it for the magical movie Anastasia and wish to view special features regarding it, I support your decision 100%  But don't buy it just because of the fact of having the poorly done sequel accompanying it. <br /> <br />I hope viewing the film awakens a yearning to find out more about Anastasia Romanov.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a very important movie for all to see. Here is what it did to me;<br /><br />1) It changed my perception of Al Gore;<br /><br />2) It made me get rid of my S.U.V.s;<br /><br />3) I now know why people think of the U.S. as fat cat capitalists ...we<br />  are;<br /><br />4) I am always aware of conserving energy and<br /><br />5) I am afraid for the future of my children.<br /><br />This is the most effective \\"horror\\" movie that you will ever see! Whether the info is accurate or not is unimportant...we cannot pretend that energy is infinite and that the Earth is immune from any treatment. Logic would dictate that the info must have some degree of accuracy.<br /><br />This should be required viewing for all. It is one of the most important movies ever and demonstrates the power of film.<br /><br />If you are reading this you probably did not see this in the theater. You should have!<br /><br />Here is an update. 2006 was the warmest year (by over 2 degrees) that was ever recorded. Any detractor from global warming is crazy and most likely influenced by politics. This movie is so frightenly prophetic that it starts to resemble mandatory viewing. It is not that the movie is so well made (although it is entertaining) it is just that the topic and urgency of it's message is vital.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Yes in fact the sky is falling but to all the self-centered,suicidal,\\"I'm taking care of my own business,\\" conservatives out there who refuse to believe anything until their conservative commentators tell them to believe it (and,by the way, blame it on the liberals),I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about since in all likelihood you won't be personally affected. The conservative mindset is framed by the belief that people have to live in and deal with the here and now and the future can take care of itself.  As this film points out the problem with that philosophy is that the ever increasing number of people affecting the here and now will lead to a quantum leap in the problems that will have to be dealt with in the near future. And while the population of the wealthy is expanding, the population of the poor and the working classes is expanding faster. Does anyone really believe that the wealthy will ever advocate government redirecting wealth to seriously address ecological issues?
B000062YAZ|5.0|I haven't read much of the other reviews.  I noticed that at the time I write this, there are 551 reviews.  So I won't say much.  This is by far the best speed metal album ever made, and the one I listened to the most in my life.  I suppose I listened to it at least 100 times.  This seems to be a common statement from a lot of people I know who love this album. <br /> <br />This album of course isn't for everyone.  I've met some speed metal fans which didn't like this much.  They were few and far between. <br /> <br />This album seems so much different than other speed metal, in that it has a distinct evil sound to it.
B000J10ERO|5.0|As a big fan of Superman movies, this movie, which is actually a sequel to the original Superman II, does not disappoint. The special effects are great (which is expected) and the storyline invokes a sense of empathy to the main character. This makes the portrayal of superman more \\"human\\" with feelings and emotions that are common to the rest of humanity.    The acting of Brandon Routh as Superman is great but not outstanding. Nevertheless, the casting of this actor as Superman is most appropriate. It makes the audience feel that they are being transported back in time to 1978 when the first Superman movie came out and Reeves was the lead actor at that time. I most definitely felt a sense of nostalgia when I compared this movie to the first two movies of the last century.    The casting of Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor was also an excellent choice. He portrays the character forcefully and his performance certainly elevates this film to a higher level.    However, I must add that the performance of Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is much to be desired for. Her portrayal seems a bit rigid and I have always felt that something was missing in her character. But her acting was not too bad.    In conclusion, if you are a fan of Superman, this is a must see movie. This movie, with its outstanding special effects certainly brings the whole superman franchise to a new level. Superman fans would not be disappointed with this latest portrayal of the \\"Man of steel\\".
B000FIMG68|4.0|The second season picks up pretty fast where the first ended and - surprisingly - does reveal some long asked questions (like the hatch). Throughout the season it seems that the producers are actually willing to give more hints at the unanswered questions than was the case in the first season. Problem: the more you reveal, the more people will think \\"hey, I would expected something more thrilling...\\". Bottom line: the concept still works, but it is wearing out...just enough to not warrant 5 stars.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer continues to amaze me. This album is great and has a different, richer flavor than \\"Room for Squares\\" or \\"Heavier Things.\\" I highly recommend it!
7884064790|3.0|I will begin by reiterating some of the comments here.  <br /> <br />Yes, this set is not oustanding in video quality but as someone said, they are no worse (if not better, I might add) than old black and white movies we see on TV. I have a Sony 50 inch widescreen LCD TV and even on that huge screen, the quality is acceptable. Some of the titles are copied from more respectable releases and are actually quite good.  <br /> <br />Yes, the subtitles on some of them are not written in the best grammar but they are not so bad you can't understand what they are saying. I have bought Japanese releases with totally incomprehensible English (like translating the name Yamato as 'Big and Number'). <br /> <br />I am happy to be able to get both Sanshiro Sugata I and II and some of Kurosawa's earlier works on DVD. Of course one cannot compare the quality  of these discs with Criterion's superbly restored 3-disc edition of Seven Samurai but for the price I paid, I have no complaints. I believe you can get this for as little as US$20 in some of the smaller cities in China. Most bootleg DVDs cost around US$1.50 over there.   <br /> <br />I don't know why some of the comments here have mentioned Kagemusha when it is clearly not in this collection. (see listing above) Warning: Shizukanaru Ketto (The Quiet Duel) doesn't have English subtitles.
0393317552|4.0|Any one interested in learning where our society was coming from, and where we are heading, this is a book to read. In this book, Diamond not only took me to the history of human kind but also explaining why we are the way we are. Read this book first before you read the \\"Collapse\\" by the same author.
B000BNXD5U|5.0|Can anybody post as to which version (criterion or MGM) this release is?
0375758992|5.0|I didn't want the book to end.  I wish that Ms. Fuller had written so much more about her life in Africa.  I couldn't put the book down.  If you like biographies at all, try this one.  It makes me sorry that my parents didn't have the courage to take us away to Africa for a few years.
0790729407|5.0|Well, of course, no historical movie is ever completely accurate but I think the film provides a legitimate view of who Michael Collins was and of the era in which he lived. I've always liked Liam Neeson, but I appreciated him about three times more after seeing this effort. His portrayal of the great hero was charismatic and riveting. As for Rickman, who plays de Valera, he's brilliant here although I don't think that I have ever seen him be average in anything. The sum of Michael Collins is far greater than its individual performances, however. The plot is brisk and it's difficult to take your eyes off the screen because even the special effects are memorable.
B0000057D8|5.0|There are tons of Brandenburg recordings out there.  How they stack up, of course, is a matter of personal taste.  But having listened to many, this one stands out.  It's crisp, fresh, and brings out the power of the music.  In far too many renditions of Bach, much gets lots.  Not so here.  Certainly better technology has made things easier over the years.  We can hear what might have been muffled in the past.  But more than that, this interpretation makes the work come alive.  Well done Trevor Pinnock.
B00005JP9V|1.0|I was pretty excited to see this movie, but was hugely disappointed.    Read the review a few reviews down entitled \\"Wasted premise ... narrow focus on modern politics instead\\"...and that is how I feel about this movie, pretty much. It lacked a purpose in every aspect of the movie. We're hardly aware of what's going on most of the time, we don't know what the Human Project is, we don't know why women are infertile, we don't know why the government is sending all immigrants out of the country, we don't know the \\"hows\\" or \\"whys\\" of anything. All we see is desperation and violence with no purpose or meaning.     Granted, the cinematography is quite well done. But I can see well done composition in a photograph. This is a movie, it was supposed to tell a story...with a beginning and an end. And hopefully a point. But alas, this movie lacks all of the above.

B000E41MRC|5.0|I got this film because of it's reputation of being arguably the finest propaganda film ever made, and after viewing it would probably agree with that. It's rather boring at times, but I've never seen anything that shows an entire nation so swept away by the ideals of one political party or what it potentialy offered it's constituency. And Hitler at the height of his popularity certainly had few peers when it came to charisma, especially since few attending these rallies apparently had any idea of what his real agenda consisted of. Leni Riefenstahl was close to a genius and this is a movie that everyone should see, for a variety of reasons.

B000J103YI|5.0|This soundtrack was always going to rise or fall on the showstopper, And I Am Telling You, Im Not Going, and thankfully Jennifer Hudson gives it her all, frankly there is no competing with Jennifer Holiday's iconic version, her's is now and will always be the defining benchmark, period, but Hudson really rips into it with heart renching soul.  Beyonce does a nice job with her recordings as well, expecially One Night Only, being a Houstonian, I love Beyonce of course, but she really does show her chops on this CD.  I loved the movie, Dreamgirls, and this is a perfect companion to the movie, it was after all a musical.  Im sure if you reading this review you've already seen the movie and hardly need me to sell you on this soundtrack, but having said that, if you have any reservations, let me say, leave your reservations at the door and get this soundtrack, it is amazing.

Pochahontas is abot the native american experence great song, Sailaway is pretty. Powderfinger is the best electric song. Wellfare mothers is good Sedan delivery is agreat fast rocker Heyhey mymy has real good electric guitar. Rust never sleeps is  Neil young and Crazyhorse at their best.  <br />
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I love \\"LOVE\\" and so will anyone who loves The Beatles. They are the most amazing band in the world. The proof is the song \\"The Sun King\\" on the CD is backwards-- originally, just a mistake. But when it was discovered they realized that it was so beautiful they left the song as is! This just proves that their music can be played backwards and it's just as beautiful.
0618680004|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the ease and clarity with which Dawkins presents arguments that philosophers and theologians always seem to be slaving over.  While some points do appear grossly redundant, I think it illustrates the trite nature of religious arguments, as well as the almost frustrating logical erroneousness of their nature. <br />I do agree that The God Delusion is unlikely to boast very many converts, but I feel that it is monumental in raising group consciousness.  Atheism and secularism have historically been viewed negatively, and thus it has in the past been difficult to recognize one's own lack-of-faith in a conscious manner.  I feel that The God Delusion has the capability to do for atheists what The Feminine Mystique did for the feminist movement.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|Sure, there are more than a few Elvis anthologies out there and, yes, there is nothing on this set that isn't readily available on a few hundred other compilations, but this one is noteworthy in its own way, and a great collection as well. Focusing less on hits than on great performances, \\"Essential Elvis\\" gathers a handful of Sun sides, the best of his early RCA output and acclaimed sides from throughout his career. You get the best of Elvis' many hits as well as critically-acclaimed album tracks (\\"Reconsider Baby\\", \\"Trouble\\", the live \\"Polk Salad Annie\\"), and that, for once, is a unique concept in Elvis reissues. Everyone will have differing opinions on what should or shouldn't have been included, and tob sure sure some great tracks have been left out, but this is a whale of a great collection of \\"essential\\" Elvis.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I was excited when I heard of this project, thinking it might provide a new twist on some classics and perhaps introduce some new, younger fans to Beatles music.  I was disappointed when I finally listened to the CD.  It is not a bad CD, but I was hoping for more.  It has its moments, like \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields\\", but not enough to carry the CD.  A lot of the songs differ very little from the originals.  It seems that most of the effort went into the transitions between the songs, which are listenable at best with some of them being downright annoying.  The sound quality is very good, which makes me wish they would go ahead and remaster and re-release the entire Beatles catalog.  All in all, I was disappointed and would recommend that you stick with the originals.
0743289412|4.0|Never let it be said that Stephen King is in a rut. When he can go from a return-to-his-roots horror novel with \\"Cell\\" to something like \\"Lisey's Story,\\" a story as much about love and faith and marriage as it is about suspense, the man is clearly still on his game, and still more than willing to stake out new territory for himself. In \\"Lisey's Story,\\" King creates characters so believable, and a story so touching, that it's the kind of book you don't really want to end. But when it does end, as it must, you'll feel like you know Lisey and Scott Landon, and you'll feel glad to have taken some small part in their story.<br /><br />As King often does, especially lately, he writes a great deal about writing in \\"Lisey's Story.\\" Scott Landon is a popular writer, and we do spend some good amount of time learning about what drives him, where he gets what he does, and why.  But the story, as the title implies, is really about Scott's wife, Lisey, and what her life is like. While King has written often about authors and their craft, this is probably the first time he has written extensively about what it must be like to be married to someone who makes stories such a part of their lives.  The frustrations, the sacrifices, the good points and the bad, all come through clearly here. Lisey Landon is no cardboard cutout, she is as full-bodied a character as any in modern fiction, and by the end of her story she lives and breathes, like a sister or a mother or a wife.<br /><br />King's tone for \\"Lisey's Story\\" is unlike any I've seen him use before, and I've been reading his books for a long time.  For me, it took a little bit of adjustment to get used to how he wrote this story, but once I got into it I was completely into it. It is engaging at first, and after a while, completely addicting.  Lisey's story goes beyond the plot or the words on the page, and becomes a multifaceted gem of a book, with something different to see every time you look at it.<br /><br />Perhaps the only book King has written like \\"Lisey's Story\\" is one he wrote several years ago, \\"Bag of Bones.\\" Both books have a love story as their central theme, with supernatural elements to enrich the story. Both books seem to be showing King digging a little deeper than he sometimes does, and telling a story that works on many emotional levels. \\"Bag of Bones\\" is one of my favorite King novels, but \\"Lisey's Story\\" is probably more successful in getting the message across.<br /><br />In the end, I think \\"Lisey's Story\\" is about many things. It is about what it must be like to be married to a writer.  It is about the two hearts of a long-standing marriage, one light and one dark, and when each one comes into play.  And most especially, most wonderfully, it is about how a truly special love, the sort of love that stands the test of time, opens up new worlds for those who experience it. For this kind of love, King makes us believe, there are no boundaries, no limits.  There is no end to it, not even death.<br /><br />And for that reason alone -- for showing us the true meaning of love and what it can be, in such an eloquent way -- \\"Lisey's Story\\" is a special book indeed.only book King has written like \\"Lisey's Story\\" is one he wrote several years ago, \\"Bag of Bones.\\" Both books have a love story as their central theme, with supernatural elements to enrich the story.

B00007KWHP|4.0|A lot of rock critics confidently claim that Fragile is far and away Yes's best studio album.  Many of these critics are the same people who denounce the band's mid-70's recordings for having songs that are too long and lacking pop sensibilities.  I think their choice of Fragile as Yes' best album is motivated by the fact that it does have shorter songs, and also because it's got some very strong material.  In my opinion, though, Yes' best work happened from [[ASIN:B00007LTI9 Close to the Edge]] to [[ASIN:B00007LTIB Relayer]], works that have longer songs (call me crazy, but I don't really mind long songs if they're as great as Yes') and are filled with great musical ideas grand structures.  I really love most of the music on Fragile, but I think some of it is too much of a mixed bag (due to the band's somewhat forced decision to \\"feature\\" individual members' songwriting) with choppy, poorly-flowing track sequencing, to call it Yes' best album.<br /><br />\\"Roundabout\\" is probably the most famous radio-ready Yes song (probably another reason why your average critic's attention is focused on Fragile), with that classic fingerstyle acoustic intro, that wicked big bass line, and Jon Anderson's trademark \\"what the heck is he singing about?\\" prog lyrics.  It's kind of a miniaturized version of some of their long songs, distilling several classical-styled movements into a flawless, 8 1/2 minute suite.  \\"Cans and Brahms\\" is a great example of why albums that feature single songs written by each group member usually don't result in transcendent material ([[ASIN:B000002UA5 Ummagumma]], anybody?).  Rick Wakeman contributes some great rock and classical-styled organ, piano and mellotron to the rest of the album, but \\"Cans and Brahms\\" doesn't really gel with the great mood set by \\"Roundabout,\\" instead sounding like joke-classical and music that would get rejected from the soundtrack to \\"[[ASIN:B00000DGXX A Clockwork Orange]].\\"  Luckily, it's short, but still essentially an interruption.  \\"We Have Heaven,\\" likewise, is a pretty interesting round-styled piece that's also basically filler, but it sounds more like Yes and it's also pretty clever the way that it shows up again at the end of the album.<br /><br />\\"South Side of the Sky\\" is another classic song--that sweet middle piano part, a great, soaring vocal arrangement, and some totally gnarly guitar runs from Steve Howe.  That song really goes a lot of places, but is again followed by a flow interruption with \\"Five Per Cent For Nothing,\\" a short, not very listenable rhythmic experiment.  A couple of the album's most successful shorter songs come up next (\\"The Fish\\" is pretty sweet as an extended jam on [[ASIN:B000002J1Y Yessongs]]) followed by another, more listenable solo contribution from Steve Howe, the flamenco-flavored \\"Mood for a Day.\\"  \\"Heart of the Sunrise,\\" a barnstorming end of the album, combines tumultuous guitar/bass doubling with an ingenious slower groove, then layers both on top of each other (way to put that classical training to use!).<br /><br />All in all, Fragile is a great album.  There's many classic songs and moments on this album, but if you take the mediocre experimentation out, there's room for another high-quality group composition.  I like Fragile a lot, but I have serious issues with calling an album with this much filler Yes' greatest album.  It's a great intro to Yes (so is The Yes Album) since it's got a couple radio songs and some experimentation that foreshadows later classics, but if you're looking for Yes' greatest, the best comes after Fragile.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I have been a Beatles fan since I was a teenager.  Having been born too late, I discovered the Beatles while working in a restaurant and hearing the song \\"Yesterday\\" being played numerous times throughout the day.  I immediatly began to devour anything and everything I could find.  <br /> <br />  After purchasing all the albums and reading everything I could get my hands on, I thought that I understood the Beatles better than anyone save the Beatles themselves. So when I noticed \\"Love\\", I figured it was just another compilation album of songs I've heard time and time again.  <br /> <br />  I saw it reviewed on \\"CBS Sunday Morning\\", I thought I would go and give it a chance.  I listened to it and from the first notes I was blown away.  I realized this was more than just another compilation album. <br /> <br />  \\"Love\\", I believe, is the kind of album the lads themselves would have wanted to make. George Martin has done a superb job on \\"Love\\". <br /> <br />  The beauty of the album is that it presents a new light on the genius of The Beatles. While listening, you can see how each song is connected to every other song in the Beatles canon.  The intensity of the extended intro of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", and the intertwining of \\"Within You, Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" brings the song alive again and presents it in a new and fresh light I have not experiened since the first time I heard it.  Of special note, is the strings added to \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  Martin has certainly brought out the beauty of the song that we all new existed but could not ourselves express. <br /> <br />  \\"Love\\" ecompasses all areas of the Beatles music from the early pop songs to the introspectivness of \\"Rubber Soul\\" to the beauty and simplicity of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". <br /> <br />  This album is a must for any and all Beatles fans, young and old alike.  You will not be disappointed and the album will make you a fan all over again.
B000005YZM|5.0|What a great album.  Occasionally, and I REALLY mean occasionally, a group will make a pop album that still remains engaging, relevant, and listenable years after it's released.  Odessey and Oracle is one of those albums.  Unlike so many groups who never even bothered trying to craft an entire, strong album and opted instead to work for that one hit single, the Zombies threw in all their chips and created a flawless, vibrant, catchy cohesive album and managed to kill their career AND get a sleeper smash hit single when it was too late.<br /><br />Of course, you've heard \\"Time of the Season\\" countless times.  Buy this album and discover the rest of the classic tracks that precede \\"Time of the Season,\\" and perhaps even that song will be reinvigorated despite its familiarity.<br /><br />The Zombies channel it all on this record--hooks by the score, seamless vocal harmonies, psychedelia, and some astounding musicianship.  As Rod Argent would later prove in his more jam-based solo work, he's got keyboard chops to spare.  Songs like \\"Care of Cell 44\\" and \\"Maybe After He's Gone\\" are propelled by impressive and catchy piano runs and riffs, and elsewhere on the album mellotron \\"strings\\" and \\"woodwinds\\" perfectly complement the trippy vocal arrangements and stop/start rhythm section song structures that make the songs rock with dynamic variety.<br /><br />This record has so many classic songs, it's hard to believe there weren't more hit singles.  \\"Brief Candles\\" is an emotionally wrenching series of portraits with a driving chorus, \\"This Will Be Our Year\\" does a great British soul/gospel thing.  Like most great pop, Odessey and Oracle also contains great wit, like \\"Friends of Mine,\\" but also some really tender heart, as on \\"A Rose for Emily.\\"  It's also pretty daring too--\\"Butcher's Tale\\" is pretty out there in subject matter and sound, really adding a more experimental and edgy feel to the end of the album.  Throughout, Colin Blunstone's golden vocal chords handle the soaring melodies (with lots of harmony help from the rest of the band), and by the time you get to \\"Time of the Season,\\" you finish the album satisfied and really appreciating the song you've heard so many times as part of a classic album.  Highly recommended for fans of British psychedelic pop a la early Pink Floyd, Beatles, etc.e soaring melodies (with lots of harmony help from the rest of the band), and by the time you get to \\"Time of the Season,\\" you finish the album satisfied and really appreciating the song you've heard so many times as part of a classic album.

B00005JO9J|5.0|We didn't see Season One so we rented this DVD and fell in love.  The characters are irresistable; I've watched this many times and it never grows old!  My favorite show on TV.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|It's amazing that these guys can make another dvd that I LOVE!  I thought that they couldn't top \\"When Hell Freezes Over\\".  This one is as equally good.  They jam and rock a little more in this one and the horn section ROCKS!  Invite some friends over and enjoy three hours of incredible entertainment!
B000AYEL1A|4.0|\\"A Star Is Born\\" is one of my favorite movies of all time, so I was very anxious to get the DVD.  I was also excited to listen to Barbra's commentary, hoping to hear interesting insights about how the movie was made and, especially, insights about Kris Kristofferson, whose soulful, anguished performance ripped out my heart.  So when I watched the movie again, it was just as wonderful as before -- I was touched and I cried.  But the commentary!  Jeez!  I have never heard such a narcissistic commentary in my life.  The only thing she says about Kris is that he was cuter than Elvis, has good teeth, can ad lib well, and that's just about it! The rest of the commentary was ALL ABOUT BARBARA!  Extremely emotional scenes would be playing with Kris dripping palpable sadness, anguish, and gut-wrenching heartbreak, and Barbra wouldn't be saying ANYTHING about him.  She'd just be talking about her stupid antique clothes or how fabulously she lit the scene. And the end of the movie was even more unbelievable. Barbra was thanking several people that helped her make the movie, and she did not make one mention of Kris!  Why wouldn't she mention him?  He was her co-star!  If it hadn't been for his heartbreaking performance, then the movie wouldn't have been such a hit.  Did something happen between them in subsequent years that would make her so deliberately avoid talking about him in the commentary?  Or is it just because Barbra is in love with Barbra?  To sum up, the movie is still wonderful, but the commentary is sickening.
B00005K3LW|5.0|The Greatest Die Hard Movie.  This one never stops with the suspense.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|I love this movie. It doesn't really make sense at first. It takes sometime to understand what is being played out. It finally makes sense towards the end. Up until that point it is fairly good. Only you can tell who the bad guy really is and that kind of sucks. Over all a good movie. So I give it 3 stars

B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is long. <br /> <br />The following is a review of the new CD+DVD-Audio release of The Beatles \\"LOVE\\".  The album was compiled as the soundtrack for the Cirque du Soliel program, \\"LOVE\\", at the Mirage Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas. <br /> <br />Hello! <br /> <br />What to say in the face of pure genius?  <br /> <br />First there is the genius of the original material.   <br /> <br />Then there is this new, amazing mix by George and Giles Martin.  After listening all the way through several times in the 5.1 DTS mix, I BEG THEM to do a 5.1 mix on DVD for the full catalog.  This leaves one final accounting of the material in today's state-of-the-art technology by its originating producer.  Please, please, please!  Our kids and grandkids need this even more than we. <br /> <br />Gentlemen, however did you keep track of this music, of each phrase, each effect?  Your headaches at the end of each day must have been massive as you built each mix.  How did you remember that the keys for such different pieces of music like \\"Goodnight\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\" matched so perfectly?  How did you make me listen so closely again to music so firmly imprinted on my soul that I could sing it from a coma?      <br /> <br />You have \\"Octopus's Garden\\" playing in three front speakers and the sound effects of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" playing in the two rear speakers-- and it works brilliantly.  Of course they would see the Octopus's Garden from the Submarine!   <br /> <br />Then there is the jarring sound of the ambulance going from left to right for Eleanor Rigby/Julia.  And I cried because suddenly John Lennon's mother, Julia, died before my ears, having been run down while crossing the street.   <br /> <br />Then there's the joy of hearing Henry the Horse dance the waltz AROUND ME in \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\", with \\"She's So Heavy\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" blended together to punctuate its end.  It's so psychedelic I can see a Walrus singing \\"Goo Goo Ga-joob\\" to me in FULL SURROUNDSOUND, and not that artificial stereo that comes 3/4s of the way through the original.  \\"Blue Jay Way\\" mixed with \\"Nowhere Man\\", and the key is perfect.  EREH SEMOC EHT NUS GNIK!  Indeed! <br /> <br />Three songs were real treats for me.   <br /> <br />The first was \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".  It begins with Lennon and guitar, which I've heard before on bootleg tapes.  Then the Martins add one instrument at a time until, finally, we hear the original.  They show us instrument by instrument how the original sound image was built.  Absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br />The second is the mix of \\"Within You, Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\".  The rhythm track is from \\"Tomorrow\\", and the lyrics track and drum are from \\"Within\\".  The Martins made me listen to this again for the first time -- really listen.  And I realized that they are, indeed, the same song-- in key structure and meaning, coming from the same SOURCE, and that we need not fear death because we come from and will return to that SOURCE, too.        <br /> <br />The third wiped me out emotionally (well, a few did, actually).   <br /> <br />\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", may be the most beautiful cut on the album.  I don't believe it is from a Beatles recording session, but may be wrong.  It is far slower than the White Album cut, without Clapton's work.  The strings are lush and a very somber Harrison sings a very edgy verse not on the original:  <br /> <br />I look from the wings/  <br />At the play your are staging/ <br />While my guitar gently weeps/ <br /> <br />As I'm sitting here/  <br />Doing nothing but aging/ <br />Still my guitar gently weeps. <br /> <br />And of course he doesn't age any longer.  And when that thought flashed through my mind, I lost it.  I'm still in mourning it seems.     <br /> <br />I used to laugh, giggle, imitate, emulate, and do my best to figure out those bizarre eight-finger guitar chords from the music charts in that big black Beatles anthology book from the 1970s.  Andnow I mourn.  I cry to John Lennon singing harmony with himself on \\"Because\\", unaccompanied by anything but bird song., because... well, you know why.  We will never hear new fruit from his soul's garden again until, one day, we transition too.  The same for George, whose music I've come to love more and more as I, too, do nothing but age.     <br /> <br />They framed my life's picture with their music until part of me died on December 8, 1980.  Another part of me died on November 29, 2001, a few short weeks after, well, after you know.   <br /> <br />From Johnny and the Moondogs; to the Silver Beatles and Stuart Sutcliffe's brain hemorrhage following the Hamburg beating; to Pete Best's firing from the band and Richard Starkey's hiring; to \\"My Bonnie\\" with Tony Sheridan; to Brian Epstein's amazing ear, persistence, and sexual infatuation with John; to Ed Sullivan and America; to Cyn being left behind at Paddington Station and a child's abandonment by his celebrity father; to Yoko; to Jane Asher's heave-ho and the Linda Eastman development; to Maureen's exit; to Patty leaving George for Eric; the breakup; rumors of reunion; to Barbara; to Olivia and Dhanni; to Ram; Band on the Run; Mind Games; The Greatest; All Things Must Pass; Bangladesh; Double Fantasy; to Mark David Chapman's gunshots on a mid-fall night in New York; to Michael Abram's knife running red; to Linda's death on a ranch in Arizona; to a new marriage and child; a cancer ending in ashes poured into the Ganges; and an ugly divorce, we come back to the one truth as valid today as when the great prophets preached it and the Beatles, and what is a prophet but a poet, sang it in 1967: <br /> <br />All You Need is Love! <br /> <br />It's a day in the life.  And what a day!     <br /> <br />Goodbye! <br />

If I want a movie that has a moral, or intellectual content, I would not watch this one.  Merryl Streep, is fantastic as always, and so are her co-stars.  I think everybody should watch it to have fun, and laugh about bosses.  I would even invite my boss to watch it together with me, so she can see how NOT to be.

B000000OMB|4.0|This album was huge (#1 in UK & USA in 1982) & finally gave Wetton a balance of musical & commercial success.  It's an interesting line-up of musicians including Steve Howe - Guitars/vocals (Yes), John Wetton - Bass/lead vocals (UK & King Crimson), Jeff Downes - keyboards/piano/vocals (Buggles), & of course Carl Palmer - Drums/percussion.  These four guys made a very powerful album from start to finish & you can hear pieces of Yes & ELP here especially in Cutting it Fine.  I especially like here comes the feeling, only time will tell, without you, & wildest dreams.  I think the bass lines could've been more technical as wetton is very capable but he gets the job done.  Steve howe is impressive as usual & the production & acoustics of the sound bring out his ability.  Downes is good but it would've been good to hear more of the cp-70 yamaha piano.  Palmer is OK but not his best work.  There are times he could have done more drum fills & less of the subtle/mystical stuff he was known for in ELP.  Otherwise this is a great album & for the time a very powerful musical expression as the teenage synth crap was really taking over the charts.  It just goes to show that when the great prog rockers like these guys or genesis or rush do something no one can compete.  This is because this type of music appeals to everyone - teens to old folks. This album has stood the test of time commercially & muscially as it has a taste of progressive & pop.

I found this one listening to casino (meola's (1978) 3rd solo effort) & it blew me away especially steve gadd'd drumming!!! anyway, I bought this cause it had al di meola & weather report guys on it.  chick's keyboarding is awesome & his fender rhodes piano sounds beutiful (this preceded the yamaha cp-70 electric).  lenny white's drumming & time signatures are mindnumbing as he has a perfect fusion & balance of jazz & aggressive progressive rhythm.  stanley clarke is also a brilliant musician.  It's important to play with people that complement your style & bring out the potential within you.  That's what happened here...  These 4 guys brought alot of innovative acoustics, intruments (including sequencers, alembic basses with instant flanger, fender rhodes piano, & mini moogs - all fairly new...),   prodution, imagination, pure genius to the studio & created a work of art which all budding musicians should use as comparison...  That's the whole point... Don't go into the studio unless you're gonna due something breathtaking & spinetingling.  That's what happened here.  Early 1976... This dazzling piece of music is timeless & represents introductions of instuments very new to the musical world...  buy this one if you like progressive jazz-fusion or just want to be inspired...  you'll be awed!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is a great DVD collection for any Star Wars fan.  It has hours of bonus material, and the movies are in the best quality you can get.  However, the singles that George Lucas released of Episodes IV, V, and VI are the ones that have both the original version (Before his added the extra effects when they were re-released in 1997), as well as the 1997 versions.<br /><br />These DVD's are the 1997 version, with added effects, and certain song changes.

0670034711|1.0|I cannot believe the positive reviews this book is getting.  I have never read such self absorbed drivel in my life.  The guru that she is talking about is the lightly veiled Guru Mayi, the celebrity guru for celebs who just can't get happy enough. <br /> <br />The author is using this book to purge herself. She keeps saying she isn't going to talk about her divorce, but never shuts up about her divorce. <br /> <br />I got through most of India and then called it a day.  I have real books to read.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|This is the ultimate Beatles trivia CD for hardcore Beatles fans. It's like an audio version of \\"Where's Waldo?\\" The album begins with Lennon's vocal track to \\"Because\\" (with the bird noises from \\"Across the Universe\\"?), followed by the \\"A Day in the Life\\" coda, then the opening chord to \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" leading into the drum solo from \\"The End\\" before sequeing into \\"Get Back,\\" and on...and on...and on. I was apprehensive at first with the notion of tinkering with the Beatles' catalog. However, with George Martin and son Giles on board, this is a seamless magical history tour, sure to delight listeners. [Running Time - 78:53] VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0892818875|5.0|This is one of those rare books that surpassed my expectations.  This is not your typical aromatherapy book and this book contains practically no recipes (it has just a few).  What you'll find in this book is about 40 of the most-popular aromatherapy essential oils brought to life.  The author does this successfully by looking at the essential oils from the perspective of the Chinese five-elements, and by juxtaposing the essential oils with archetypes from mythology, religion and astrology, helping you to experience the \\"personality\\" of each essential oil.<br /><br />The author goes over some common psychological and emotional issues that people experience and suggests which essential oils may be most suitable.  The book also contains a couple of illustrated pages related to applying massage and accupressure.
B00065GX64|4.0|The economy, austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and precise filmmakers...<br /><br />Lang, a master of the German expressionist film, shot his first talkie, a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies... It was a shocking idea for its time, based on the real-life killer Peter Kurten, headlined as the Vampire of D&uuml;sseldorf...<br /><br />'M' is about a terrorized city, and a plump little man with wide eyes (often chewing candy) who is a pathological child-killer, unable to control his urge for killing...<br /><br />The film embodies several Lang themes: the duality between justice and revenge, mob hysteria, the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in, and, for probably the first time in the cinema, it adds a new dimension to suspense: pity... For the killer is clearly mentally sick... He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease, and yet, we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal, rather than treated as a sick man...<br /><br />Early in the film, the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from 'In the Hall of the Mountain King'. This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace... And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window, the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there, just out of sight...<br /><br />The Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since 'Casablanca,' 'The Maltese Falcon,' and 'The Mask of Dimitrios.' When the photographs of his victims, all little girls, are shown to him, he jumps back and twitches with horror...<br /><br />With powerful visuals, Lang's motion picture is Lorre's first film... His performance as the corpulent, hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion... Lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes, outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal... He had only twelve lines of dialog...<br /><br />In the most famous of all about a pathological killer - Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre, but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy...<br /><br />'Psycho' reeked with blood and horror, whereas the suspense of 'M' is subtle... A child's balloon without an owner, a rolling ball, are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed... The audience, trapped in its seats, torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer, watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight...typal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes, outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal...

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore gave one great presentation about dangers that are we all facing because of CO2 emissions and global warming.    His straight-forward explanation is very different from the Al Gore we all got used to while he was VP. No nonsense talks and clear arguments that everyone can understand.     There will be people who will challenge all of these facts, but hey, there are people who are still trying to spin and argue about damages caused by smoking, etc.    Whenever \\"big money\\" is attacked, one can expect to be attacked back.     In many of these reviews you will see a person signed as \\"E. Keech\\", who will reply with bunch of unproven arguments and documents with questionable originality.    He is trying to distract people's attention from the main message of this movie, for at least for that small second that takes any sane person to see that \\"E. Keech\\" is nothing but an employee by big companies who destroy our environment.     \\"E. Keech\\", I hope you wake up one day, and you realize that no money in the world is worth the destruction that melting of only one of big icebergs can bring.

B00005JPCY|4.0|Movies where time plays a huge role and people are trying to change the future or the past has always brought interesting movies. We have the Back to the Future films, the Time Machine and many more. Now, a new acquisition to this genre has been created. An entertaining thriller by director Tony Scott starring Denzel Washington: Déjà Vu. <br /> <br />The story in short without any spoilers:  <br />A ferry explodes in New Orleans and there are over 500 casualties. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) wants to investigate this chase till the bottom and gets the help of Agent Andrew Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer). Pryzwarra and his team have a special methode of solving crimes. They have the technology to look 4 days in the past. With this methode, Carlin has a chance to change the past. <br /> <br />The story feels a bit farfetched sometimes but is well worked out and leaves an entertaining and thrilling impression. The performances by the actors are great and Denzel Washington definitely steals the show. He was a great choice for the leading role. The story takes the characters from good dramatic scenes to thrilling action sequences. Trust me, following someone over a busy highway who is 4 days in the past is absolutely spectacular.  <br />The film is well balanced and leaves you with a satisfying feeling inside. <br />The atmosphere is also something that helps the film, which is mostly created by the colourwork. Green and dark colours give the film a serious and thrilling look. Another thing is the music, composed in a certain style that gives the film it's special feeling and sound.  <br />  <br />So Déjà Vu has become a good and entertaining thriller with fine acting performances and a fantastic story that gives you a fun time at the movies. Recommended to action and thriller fans.
B00009XITQ|5.0|Strong? Yes, I'm referring to her work att getting the otherwise mediocre film Lovewrecked off the ground in spite of the total incompetence of the director and writer. Is there such a thing as malicious incompetence? <br />Properly supported, as in What a Girl Wants, she is brilliant.
0689853637|4.0|While the concept and cut outs are incredible, I was disappointed with the fact that some of the pages were marred.  The silver on the grizzly pages was idented and marred just from the packaging and/or the weight of the book.  Other than those minor issues, loved the book and would consider giving it as a gift.   Can you fix the production problem?
B000021XS0|5.0|I absolutely love this album. What more could you want than a Unique, yet powerful singer, a bassist that could give Victor Wooten a run for his money, a keyboardist, you can literally make those keys go as fast as the guitarist, John Petrucci, who is hands down in the TOP 10 best guitarits' living, and in my opinion, with out a doubt, the best drummer in the world standing . . Mike Portnoy. All extremely talented musicians that most if im not not mistaken graduated from frickin Berklee, in Massachusetts, which means you have to be as good as God himself to even be accepted. Every song has awesome meaning to it, and the musicians REALLY show themselves worthy in this mesmorizing, depth of an album. Thank you Dream Theater for always having a \\"new beat\\" in every song/album. You all have proven to be arguably the best musicians to have ever lived . . And for all of you who disagree with that statement, just ask youself truthfully if you ever could do HALF of what they have to do. .
0812550706|4.0|This book was exactly what good books are supposed to be: captivating, thought-provoking, and uniquely imaginative. It's not a long book, but it is addicting; once started, it reads very quickly. <br /> <br />There were a few things I didn't like, though. One of them was the continous use of fart-related slang. The other was the post-cold-war setting. Yes, I know, Card had no way of knowing that the Soviet Union would fall and there would be no Second Warsaw Pact. But it did detract just a little from the story's realism. <br /> <br />I'm not a die-hard sci fi fan (I don't like to be limited by genres) but Ender's Game remains one of my favorite books. I didn't give it five stars because that would imply that this book was as close to perfection as any book can be. It wasn't, but it was still a fun read and I'd recommend it to anyone, science fiction lover or not.
B000002MJ0|4.0|You know, it's kind of ironic, my experience with this group. I thought of 'em as a real head-scratcher band when I heard \\"Loveless\\" a couple years ago, one of the first times I realized that \\"indie\\" music wouldn't come to me as easily as I had initially thought. However, there was a romantic overtone and nice tunes that fascinated me at the same time and while I don't think it's 5-star good, this album sort of warmed me up to it. <br /> <br />It's a pretty solid album throughout. It's not the overproduced experiment of \\"Loveless,\\" but rather, more them making pop songs in the vein of Jesus and Mary Chain. They still have their own identity though. Feedback rules over \\"All I Need.\\" My favorite two songs are \\"Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside)\\" and \\"No More Sorry,\\" which showed that they had genious in them before their highly praised swan song. I wish I enjoyed the second half as much as the first, but it's alright.
B0007WYFHU|4.0|This may a book you either love or hate simply based on its style. The main story itself is simple yet compelling; Shakespearian in its basic elements of archetypal characters trying to create and define themselves in a world that has already made its own plans for everyone. But each character has their own backstory that all informs the main plot and climax. \\"The devil is in the details\\" definitely holds true for this novel - either you enjoy Roy's endless metaphors, both for simple imagery and for the overarching themes, or you don't. Her prose is beautiful but sometimes gets in the way of simply telling the story. If you can get past the first chapter though, then the rest of the book should be enjoyable and evocative, and will probably make you want to read it again right away.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I actually understand where many who don't like this come from. This isn't really the most energetic album I've come across at all, but it's not about being heavy or intense -- it is neither of those things. Also, I agree that the excessive hype made me hesistant and I still think Wilco are a very overrated band, however, this is one time when they actually do impress me. If you followed them before, this might not seem as \\"groundbreaking\\" as other critics kept calling it. There are a bunch of great songs, and one thing I also disagree about it people talking about how the record's esoteric. It's not. These are mostly pop songs, although in cases like \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" the electronics of the track come in, kind of like a new element to their song. Also, the group transcended from alt-country long earlier in their career, arguably as far back as \\"Being There\\" from '96. Jeff Tweedy is not an amazing vocalist, but is listenable and fits with the music fine enough. I may also note that his voice doesn't exactly sound uplifting, either. The emotion/character and the songs are what make \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" a great record. It did not seem unnecessary to me like the re-hash of older works put through new age music (in my terms) known as \\"A Ghost Is Born,\\" and the songs do more for me than on \\"Summerteeth,\\" actually. <br /> <br />If I could make any complaint, it's that \\"Reservations\\" could have ended about three minutes sooner. That was a completely unnecessary and draggy ending. That being said, it is a minor complaint, and if you're into hooks, give it some time for them to sink in because they are there. This record is a winner and while I'm not huge on Wilco, I am a fan of \\"YHF\\".
B000I5X81K|4.0|There are some wonderful tenors out there and Josh Groban is one of the best but up until AWAKE I found myself easily bored with some of his songs. I'd like to hear a little more skilled rolling of his \\"r\\"s and a softer sound to his \\"t\\"s when singing Italian songs.  <br /> <br />I am probably the only person in the western hemishpere who didn't like \\"You Raise Me Up\\" but that song is the reason I never bought the CD.  <br /> <br />Awake is something else. This just might be the CD to win the rest of us hold-outs over. It's won me over with his versatility, his willingness to take artistic chances, his ability to have some fun with a very serious voice. He's different--he's cool--he's talented. I'm hooked.
0670888443|5.0|Jon Scieszka (rhymes with Fresca) has faithfully transcribed Alexander T. Wolf's account of events resulting in the loss of life and limb (and straw) of certain small pigs on a fateful day in history. According to Mr. Wolf, the demise of the pigs was not the result of vicious, intentional blowing-down of their various houses, but, in fact, was due to a series of unfortunate events, a multitude of which were due to their hoggish rudeness. Mr. Wolf's innocent, polite requests to borrow a cup of sugar while afflicted with the common cold were alternately ignored, denied and ridiculed. Walk a mile in A. Wolf's shoes and you will see that he's been unfairly maligned all these years due to some minor mis-communication with a trio of ill-mannered swine. Other well-spun yarns of similar quality and entertainment value can be found in Sciezka's The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales.
B000ION79Y|1.0|I've been an ardent fan of Seagal's since his first movie and even told others how he was my favorite since he was so authentic. I've been a martial artist since the 70s and appreciate realism. Seagal is an Akido master and had all the right moves as well as actually being a gun enthusiast. Watching him handle a weapon was much more realistic than most of the other inept Hollywood actors that only have a basic clue which end the bullet comes out of. <br /> <br />I don't recall the names of the last two or three movies (Submerged was one) but my wife and I agreed they were extremely sub-par for him. I keep giving him chances because I like him but Attack Force was the last straw. We rented it and actually stopped it last night in the middle of the film so I could do a Google search to see if any information was out on it. The Google search lead me to Amazon where I read the reviews and noted that almost everyone was disappointed, with good reason. <br /> <br />Come on Steven, get on the treadmill, reopen a dojo, do some deep meditation and get back with someone that knows how to produce movies. Almost the entire movie was filmed at night and hard to see - intentional, I believe to hide inadequacies. Hardly any martial arts by Segal and the realism was just missing. One blow that knocks someone through a 2 foot solid brick wall and they get back up and walk like nothing happened? This wasn't supposed to be a vampire movie..... <br /> <br />Once, shame on you, twice, shame on me. Triple shame on me for watching the last three movies, hoping Steven would come back. Sadly enough, I've given up and will not throw away any more money or waste my time on him. I would think you would care more for your supportive fans, Steven :-( <br />
B000002KFJ|5.0|What can be said about this great album by THE pioneers of metal. There is not a weak track on here. Everything is just solid in every aspect. Now tensions were really beginning to rise during this album with the band, but this had no effect at all on the quality of the overall musical outcome. Many songs have some slower, acoustic parts in them, but fear not the metal is still totally intact. I thought this would be a very good, solid Sabbath offering, but it exceeded even my original expectations. This album deals with more psychological lyrics and meanings than their other albums. They have a couple epics on here, which I also loved. Those being Megalomania, The Writ, and you might say Smyptom Of The Universe. That created a great vibe for the whole album. Ozzy never sounded better. Geezer really shines here and gets my vote for best performance. Bill is also outstanding, and of course Tony does a superb job. There are also two excellent instrumentals, those being Don't Start(Too Late) and Supertzar.<br /><br />Hole In The Sky- 9.5/10- Great way to start out the album. Catchy beats and more of an energetic, lively sound rather than drudgy, sludge guitar. An instant Sabbath classic.<br /><br />Don't Start(Too Late)- 9/10- A short, quick acoustic instrumental. Outstanding guitar work on this one. It's really a great relaxing intro to what's coming next.<br /><br />Symptom Of The Universe- 10/10- This Is Sabbath? You beat ya, with a heavier twist on things than ever before. #1 song on the album and has the catchiest riff on the whole album. It then slows down to acoustics toward the end, which end it off perfectly.<br /><br />Megalomania- 10/10- Epic. That isn't a word to commonly associated with Black Sabbath, but that's exactly what this one is, clocking in just under ten minutes. Starts off with a bit of a haunting intro and stays mellow for awhile then hits fast, heavy speed.<br /><br />The Thrill Of It All- 9/10- An excellent song, with an earlier sound of Sabbath. Great guitar solo at the beginning. Definitely another catchy one. The clapping on this song is actually two crew members of Sabbath and Bill Ward's brother, Jim.<br /><br />Supertzar- 9/10- This one gives off a different sound for Sabbath, but in a good way. It is an instrumental with the 40 piece London Chamber Choir brought in to record. At this time, the song had the title, \\"We Sell the Worst Chips in the Country.\\"It was later given the appropriate name of which it now is. It gives off a nice, unique vibe to it. They also start many of their shows off with this one.<br /><br />Am I Going Insane- 8.5/10- This is the weakest song on the album, but I still love it and in my opinion fits in quite nicely. I might not have picked this one for a single as they did, but it is still a very worthy, listenable track. Give this one some time and it will grow on you.<br /><br />The Writ- 9.5/10- An excellent way to end off the album. It's a fairly mellow epic which gets heavier as time goes on. This one was based at the poor management of Sabbath. At the end of The Writ on some album versions(not mine) there is a 30 second track called Blow On A Jug, which is Ozzy and Bill messing around in the studio.<br /><br />Also, the album cover was in fact 'sabotaged' in a sense. What is on the cover is not how the band intended it, but management yet again screwed Sabbath over. The band wanted it to take place at an old, dark, gloomy castle with a stained glass window emitting light at one end. The band members would be dressed in full black, and behind each member would be an old mirror showing the reversed reflection. Ozzy called his outfit on the cover 'a homo in a kimono.' Bill Ward squeezed into Ozzy's chequered underpants and an embarrasingly revealing pair of red tights bought for him by his partner Mysti. They weren't going to wear the clothes they're wearing on the cover, but the record company tricked them into the whole ordeal.This is one of their many classic albums.Don't let this one pass you buy. It took me quite some time to get this one, but man was it worth it. This one deserves more credit than it gets. Pop this one in and enjoy the classic sound of one of metal's finest.one, but man was it worth it. This one deserves more credit than it gets.

6305181810|5.0|Matt Damon stars as a freshly minted lawyer fighting a large insurance company that simply collects insurance without paying benefits - in this case they denied payment for life-saving treatment to a dying young man.  The insurance company's side is taken by highly-experienced attorneys billing at up to a thousand dollars/hour.  Aided by intelligent but six-time bar exam flunker Danny DeVito and his contacts, Damon wins the suit along with a monumental punitive award.  Unfortunately, the insurance company is but a shell, having been looted by its CEO (Roy Scheider), and no damages are paid.<br /><br />We are left with two memorable images:  1)Damon pondering his future in law - should he continue (and undoubtedly end up using the law to fight justice - as did his opponent, Jon Voight), or take his love of the law and go into teaching?  2)DeVito heading out the door in pursuit of another attempt at passing the bar.
0783231032|5.0|Yet another film that polarizes everyone. I love it. I love every minute of it. I can quote 50% of the lines when I see the movie. The cast is great, the cinematography is gorgeous (although the DVD quality is not as good) and the way that all the storylines come together at the end. Superb.
015603283X|4.0|At the time I first reviewed this book I only dabbled in mysteries because I found that all too often they were either too transparent or too dark. Of course, the dark side of anything seems to be that which draws us into the story--where's the conflict when everything is working well? Mysteries require death and darkness. How many characters have been sacrificed on the altar of fictionary expediency? But dabbling is often rewarded; I am glad that I found The Club Dumas and was pleased to find a uniquely interesting take on bibliomania easily analogized to any of the many interests that can imprison the willing.<br /><br />This work is a great piece of misdirection. Frankly any commentary on the story risks betraying the device used with such skill by Mr. Perez-Reverte and which I believe sets this book apart as a great read. And given the reverence of the characters for the works of Dumas, I suspect that I'll have to go start reading The Three Musketeers and Count of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />There is a great truth taught in this work. Unsavory characters have unsatisfactory lives. Further, why do we tend to embrace that which has no power to enrich? Take the character of Fargas, the last member of a great family who has retreated into himself. Fargas lives in his decaying family mansion, which is literally falling apart all around him, spending his time with his only friends--his books. Not just books, but fantastically rare and valuable works. Every year or so Fargas selects one of the treasures every now and again to \\"sacrifice\\" for the good of the others. Yet despite the surpassing wealth represented by the pile of rare editions, Fargas can't seem to part with the books and restore his family's fortune. Our protagonist, Corso, likewise has so retreated into himself that he questions the value of everything about him--yet he encounters a group that seems to find joy and meaning in the very books that Corso sees only as money.<br /><br />Regrettably, our author has doubts about the power of his language to portray the interpersonal relationships--if only he, as could Dumas, could have avoided the explicit descriptions of that which needs no description, the work would have easily secured a fifth star.hor has doubts about the power of his language to portray the interpersonal relationships--if only he, as could Dumas, could have avoided the explicit descriptions of that which needs no description, the work would have easily secured a fifth star.

This is probably not the best strategy for this particular book, because it really is a book you'd like to bookmark and use as a reference.

A foraged meal.<br /><br />He compares them in relation to industrial intensity, fossil fuel consumption, waste (chemical and organic), sustainability, profitability, and, finally, taste.<br /><br />After reading this book, here's what will happen:<br /><br />1.  You will see no. 2 field corn in many, many more of the food products you consume,<br /><br />2.  You will think, for some period of time, about \\"organic\\" and \\"humanely raised\\" products,<br /><br />3.  You may consider vegetarianism, or you will be more supportive of the vegetarians you know, and<br /><br />4.  Most of you will probably continue with your existing eating and shopping habits.<br /><br />This book needs to be read in concert with a number of other foods, including Fast Food Nation, Super-Size Me, Animal Liberation, and, I'd suggest, Bloodties, by Ted Kerosote.<br /><br />I wanted to comment on two parts of the book in particular.  First, the whole section on foraging for fungi seemed out of proportion to the contributions of mushrooms both to our diets and to Pollan's final meal.  Second, his discussion of hunting was awkward in a number of instances.  The consumption of alcohol during his first pig hunt -- was it a couple of bottles of wine per person? -- was strangely conflicting with the  ethical arguments he was making throughout most of the book.  The alcohol did affect his hunting, and he was only a trigger pull away from a tragic hunting accident (aka a \\"Cheney\\").  In addition, he spent too little time practicing with his rifle, did no scouting prior to hunting, and never discussed the true energetic cost of his pig/morel/cherry/bean/bread/wine dinner.  The latter point was interesting since he continually brought up the cost of various foods in terms of waste production and barrels of oil used.<br /><br />When it came to understanding farming, or feedlot production, or tearing field corn into chemical bits, or even animal rights, Pollan depended on experts to give him insight.  When it came to hunting, he depended on a friend of his that brought wine to the hunt for lunch.  Pollan should have contacted Ted Kerosote or David Petersen (A Hunter's Heart).<br /><br />Nevertheless, I found The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, worthy of consumption, rumination, and absorption.on of alcohol during his first pig hunt -- was it a couple of bottles of wine per person? -- was strangely conflicting with the  ethical arguments he was making throughout most of the book.

B000005EJL|5.0|Ironically, the mass-market popularity of Supertramp rests on a the hummable hooks of its middle-period albums. Thus, I can only guess that the many criticisms of this particular album come from fans to whom \\"Logical Song\\" seems the pinnacle of musical achievement. Too bad for them... they're missing out on some of the best work of this band's career. This is most certainly a Supertramp album to rival (and in some ways, exceed) the best output of their halcyon days. <br /> <br />Yes, gone are the trite little singles of Breakfast in America. Instead, the band expands its reach, weaving a lavish musical tapestry of many scintillating instrumental threads. There's an echo here of the beautiful studio jamming of Supertramp's vastly under-rated first album. Some reviewers (All-Music Guide, shame on you) have taken this as a sign that Supertramp 'can no longer create catchy little songs.' Hey, maybe they've simply evolved beyond that sort of silliness. The tracks on Some Things Never Change sound at once familiar, yet fresh and new. But where earlier works tended to stop short, these go on, achieving their jazzy, mesmerizing potential in a full five, six, or nine minutes. <br /> <br />Bands move on; if you trust their vision, then you have no choice but to follow where they lead. The reward is discovering unexpected gems like this one.
6305922756|5.0|It's rare for me to outright keep loving comedies. The problem with them is that once you've gotten the joke, it either does make you laugh but not as much as the first time or simply no laugh at all. Somehow though, this film manages to be funny even if you've seen it several times. Staged as a \\"rockumentary\\" about a fictional band, the film manages to be hilarious, filled with good drama and even some social commentary. This is probably Rob Reiner's finest and just one of comedy's better film outings. <br /> <br />The film follows Martin DiBergi(Reiner) documenting the British group Spinal Tap as they're about tour the US in support of their new album \\"Smell the Glove\\". Members David, Nigel and Derek find that touring has its share bit of problems from lack of promotion, cancelled shows, problems with artwork and many other problems. Of course it doesn't help the members are either ridiculously genius or smartly stupid. <br /> <br />There's so many classic moments that it's hard to pinpoint the most hilarious. Whether it's Derek's comment about his role as lukewarm water, Nigel's vulgar title for a beautiful piano piece or the infamous Stonehedge scene, it's one of those kind of films where it's best if you just watch it and laugh rather than explaining the jokes since it wouldn't be as funny. The film was largely improv'd and it allows the film to have a more brisker pacing and jokes come easier rather than peppering the film with comedic moments at certain points. <br /> <br />The highlight of the special features is the \\"band commentary\\" where actors Michael McKean(David), Christopher Guest(Nigel) and Harry Shearer(Derek) supply commentary in character about the film. While it does get old since they essentially derail everything in the film but some is just hilarious. I'm particularly fond of the start-up menu before the film logo where one says of a black screen \\"it's like space without the stars\\" and the other goes \\"that's really quite poetic, man\\". <br /> <br />Whereas the Princess Bride was more whimsical and even \\"magical\\", Spinal Tap is just simply funny and even insightful.

B000LC3ID8|5.0|the saw movies never fails to suprise me! this movie had a great twist to it(just like the last two). that to me is what makes a good film when at the very end of the movie,your left with your mouth hanging open from the amazing shocker that this movie delivers! its a horror movie with out a silly monster or some crazed slasher with a mask! good horror movie for 2006
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the Broadway musical first (in Chicago in 4/2006) and absolutely feel in love with the music, along with everything else about the show.  As soon as I got home I ordered the CD. I listen to it on a very regular basis. I still enjoy it as much today as I did the very first time I heard it. Each time I hear it I'm able to relive a truly wonderful experience. Not only do I highly recommend the CD, but the show as well and since were at it, you may as well throw in the book too. It really is a wonderful story. It answers questions that you didn't even know you had. But the music is what makes it so special.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I was not expecting such a sad sounding Christmas CD.  I wish it could of had a few cheerful songs.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I have to disagree with your statement that Fantasia is not for children.  True - it was never intended to be a children's movie, but my own grandchildren have been nothing less than mesmorized by this beautiful film since they were about 18 months - 2 years old.  Both are lively, VERY active little boys who are now 4 and 6 but they ask to watch this movie every single time they come over to my house.  They started with the Mickey Mouse \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" and then moved onto the dinosaurs in the \\"Rite of Spring\\" and now watch nearly all the movie.  It is magical for children and I would strongly encourage anyone to expose their children/grandchildren to this beautiful, classic movie.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This film baffled me completely.  It has nothing to do with the real brothers Grimm, and nothing to do with their fairy tales either.  It has an extremely silly plot, and the characters are too grotesque to arouse any sympathy whatsoever. The film has nothing to recommend it whatsoever, except that it does end eventually.  You could make a good film out of Grimms Fairy tales.  This isn't it.  Watching it was a grim experience.
B000J10EQU|4.0|As the end credits were rolling for Superman Returns I thought, \\"Wow, that was great, but what was all that Christ stuff about?\\"    You know, the part where Superman's Dad Jor-El (voiced by Marlon Brando) talks about sending his only son to Earth to help the humans who want to be a great people and who have a great capacity for good. That reference was about as subtle as being hit over the head with a 2-by-4 with the word \\"Christ\\" carved into it. It kind of felt the same too, in that it left me stumbling around dazed, thinking, \\"Huh? What just happened?\\"    That's because in 30+ years of enjoying Superman comics and movies, I never once heard that Superman had anything to do with Jesus Christ. I never saw a resemblance on my own either. To me, Superman was always about fighting the bad guys, and Truth, Justice, and the American Way.    So I did some research just to make sure I hadn't missed something. One of the original creators of Superman said the sources for the character were Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter of Mars and Tarzan, Johnston McCulley's Zorro, and E.C. Seegar's Popeye. Superman also appears to have been influenced by Jack Williamson's The Girl From Mars.    Nothing about Christ in those sources. Just good old-fashioned heroism.    Other than someone named Elliot Maggin adding some Christian coloring to Superman in the 1970's, Superman has not really been associated with Jesus.    Also, if I remember correctly, Superman's father originally planned for he and his wife and their son Kal-El to all go to Earth. It was only because the planet Krypton blew up too early that he sent only his son Kal-El to Earth - because only a small prototype of the ship they were going to use had been built by that point.    So the stuff about Superman's Dad sending his only son \\"by design\\" is just plain wrong.    Despite the distraction due to this little bit of Christian revisionism, it was otherwise a very enjoyable Superman movie. I give it 4 stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought 5 copies of this box set for friends and family for Christmas, already having my own.  Now at six days into the new year, I've gotten NOTHING but \\"Thank you\\"s from people, as they finish it.  Actually, I'm sorry that's not true.   My friend from DC has called me twice to say \\"Curses on you for recommending such a good show that was cancelled after one season.\\"  The first call was after he and his wife watched all of the episodes. The second call as he and his wife were in the midst of the second viewing.  He particularly mentioned the quality of the music, the unique camera shots and I pointed out how even in the very first episode, you could see little things, like the signs on the billboards and other details that Whedon has worked into the show to give it longevity.   <br /> <br />As you can tell from my friend's testimonial, if you buy this DVD set, you can expect to get your money's worth.  You will be begging for more at the end of it.  It is very worth watching a second time.  I've watched most episodes three times and I am on my forth time through now listening to the audio commentaries. <br /> <br />Comparing this series to other prominent sci fi shows reveals Lexx too far on the fringe, Farscape as never fully grasping its potential, Star Trek TNG first season as toooo fresh, Stargate SG1 as too predictably linear (although this compare better than most), and Red Dwarf as too... British ;).  This show is shot with cinematic quality and tried to force too much innovation on the network too quickly (Wide screen?  Why would Fox broadcast in wide screen - no one wants that!).  It paid the price for innovation, but at $25 from Amazon, you don't have to. <br /> <br />While I do not watch this show with my young children in the room, it is a show that works equally well for both genders.  If you want to spend quality time with a friend, spouse, or older family, watching Firefly will be an almost guaranteed success.  The moral aspects of the show are seeds for good discussions on morality, marraige, religion, faith, trust, strength and reliablity.  Any geek will be hooked by the first space scene where Whedon was bold enough to film with no sound in space (ships don't go \\"whooosh\\" as they fly by).  Some will be facinated by the merging of the American and Chinese cultures and language, while other will be facinated by the morality play of a \\"Shepard\\"'s relation ship with the female \\"Companion\\" who gains the ship access to many ports of call.  Firefly has so many levels that it appeals almost all personalities. <br /> <br />Perhaps the Fox executives made a slight mistake as they decided to air the two hour series pilot LAST after canceling the series...  There is no reason this show should be off the air.
014240165X|5.0|Alex Rider is a great spy sensation that will be awesome forever.  He's like the 007 that atracts a more younger crowd.  This first book is a great way to start off the 14 year old spy's adventures.  This book tells the origin of the next great spy of the modern age.  I absolutly love these books.  Anyone who has Anthony Horowitz before or any other spy books, you will fall in love with the Alex Rider series.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|This is the coolest movie I have ever seen.  The atmosphere and tone catch my attention.  I do not know why reviewers gave this title such a bad rating.  This movie is unique.  If you are looking for something different and refreshing from the mundane films available now in days then definitely get this awesome DVD!
B000001F3C|5.0|Hopefully I don't speak only for myself when I say that this is my favorite U2 cd.  There is not one bad song on the album.  There isn't even any mediocre song--they are all honestly beautiful and amazing.  U2 is amazing (save for their newer material...).  If you're contemplating buying this, just do it.  You will not regret it.
1591396190|3.0|This book has a very good point to make - basically, avoiding competition and finding your own market niche is a good idea. But that is not really enough material for a complete book, so there is a lot of filler included, and even then, it's a short book.    If you are a newcomer to business or product strategy, you will find this book helpful and easy to read.
B000002ADT|5.0|If you enjoy music, and you have a pulse, then you should go out and buy this famous album right now.  It is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements in music history.  You don't even have to be a jazz fan to appreciate this amazing work of art.  It is my favorite album of all-time!  I have it on CD and vinyl and enjoy listening to both.  This is the album that really made Miles a star and it's easy to see why.  Coltrane, Cannonball, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, Wynton Kelly, and Jimmy Cobb along with Miles make up arguably the greatest line-up in Jazz history.  Every second of this beautiful (and that's an understatement!) album is excellent and a pure joy.  I can honestly say that I have listened to it more than any other record/CD and never tire of it.
0307237699|5.0|How can you not love this man?  (Apparently those whose reviews show they do not are not as magnanimous as Senator Obama!) <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer who thought this book might be good for high school civics clases.  After 19 years of formal schooling and several degrees, it was a terrific review of government, politics, and world affairs. <br /> <br />Should he decide to become a candidate for the presidency the man's humanity and brilliance more than compensate for his few years in the national political arena. <br /> <br />A fantastic book!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine was one of the better comedies of 2006.  It had great characters, all with their own quirks, working together to tell a funny story.  The story is told over a shortt 3 or 4 days, where one tragedy after another falls on this band of misfits....just when it appears that life can't get any worse, something crazier happens.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|A dysfunctional family takes to the road for their daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), who has a shot at the finals of a beauty pageant for little girls in California. Greg Kinnear is Richard a success obsessed father who developed a mental training method to succeed, and Alan Arkin is a powder-sniffing Grandpa. Everyone in this family has some problem; Toni Collette as Sheryl, Richard's wife, Steve Carell as suicidal Frank and Paul Dano as Dwayne who vowed never to speak. The film has already been praised by the critics and general audiences, but it is also true that the film is not to everyone's taste. <br /> <br />Many people say \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a funny comedy. I don't disagree with their opinions, but I find the film totally different way because the film contains a considerable amount of sadness or poignancy in it behind the apparently hilarious part of the film. I am not sure this sadness creeping into the film's world is really the original intention of the directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer Michael Arndt, but I can say if you're looking for a kind of story in which underdogs become what you call \\"winners,\\" maybe this is not your film. <br /> <br />For all the absurd scenes in their cross-continental journey or the farces at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, the characters take themselves very seriously, and are determined to be true to themselves. And their adamant decision might sometimes irritate you. The characters are not begging to be liked, but still you will notice the changes of heart in every one of them by the end of the story. So \\"heart-warming\\" would be a misleading tag to this film for the people in it are often annoying like someone in your own family.  <br /> <br />The actors are all great. Many have already praised Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and of course Abigail Breslin the centerpiece of the film, so I won't add any more words. The filmmakers are clearly helped greatly by their talent - Paul Dano's son partneeds more improvement and some minor characters like police officer or hospital doctors are not as great as others -- but the entire cast of the main characters still did a fine job. <br /> <br />`Little Miss Sunshine' is not free from cliché and unnecessary quirkiness. The satires could have been more biting with more skillful or daring treatment of the pageant scenes, where little girl Olive does one thing. It is not my cup of tea, but the film is certainly a good character study, not afraid of showing unlikable part of them. Or you may come to like them in spite of (or because of) their flaws.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Has a really good sound.  This is the most creative CD I've heard in a really long time.
B0002YLC24|5.0|<br />A remarkable captivating, excellent scripted and sensitively acted film. <br /> <br />Before Sunset is simple story on the surface. We all at times wonder 'what if?' about a former relationship that did not end in closure. Nine years on, both lovers have progressed in their lives and into different relationships. But they are captivate by each other in an unexpected meeting. This film lives out that wonder and answers so many of the questions we would have if we ever had that opportunity and the maturity to face an unfinished love.  <br /> <br />For such a simple and central plot it is remarkable that the film has subtle sub-plots. Pay careful attention to the opening. It sets the scene and raises questions, not only about the plot but also about the structure used to tell the story. Listen to the music and appreciate its significance as part of the story. A very skillful and intelligent film. <br /> <br />The film is all the more delightful by the obvious personal collaboration between three people who together wrote, acted and directed the film. Each personally grew through the process as many are privileged to do in making real art. For that reason the film comes across as real life with real but not excessive emotions portrayed by endearing and enduring characters.  <br /> <br />Before Sunset shows when and how to make a sequel. It builds on the original. It is a film to watch again and again for what it helps us to understand about our lives may never have the opportunity to put into words let alone live out. <br /> <br />After you have watched 'Before sunset', you will be wondering about the next 'episode'. The plot will again be predictable because that's life, but told by these skilled storytellers you will want to watch it and find out.   <br /> <br />just Jack   <br /> <br />
0553579908|4.0|If you're considering this book, then you've obviously read the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones.  If not, don't even try beginning with this book.  Martin constructs an elaborately detailed civilization with richly developed characters.  Attempting to begin with Book 2, would only lead to confusion and disappointment.<br /><br />If anything, I believe this book was even more enjoyable than Book 1.  Any time an author creates a new world with numerous characters, it takes 200-300 pages just to become familiar with it and them.  At least when starting Clash of Kings, the reader is well familiar with the landscape, and what a landscape!<br /><br />What I enjoy most about Martin is the realism in his work.  People die, and it's not always the bad guys.  There is brutality, murder and rape, just as there certainly was in the medieval style culture on which this series is modeled.  There is also honor, loyalty and heroism, and conversely, not always displayed just by the good guys.  It's not as simple as good vs. evil, there is some of each in most of the characters.<br /><br />While there is magic, it is not the kind of \\"over the top\\" magic that requires a reader to suspend belief.  If the \\"good guy\\" has his back against the wall, he is more likely to die than be rescued by a magician's spell.<br /><br />Again, this is a more than worthy successor to the original book in the series and a great springboard into Book 3.  If you liked Book 1, you might as well fill out your dancecard for all the remaining installments.
0618680004|1.0|Dawkins moral crusade is so divisive that most readers of this review will have already concluded that I am on one side of the debate or the other. I am not.<br /><br />I believe science provides the answers about our universe. I agree with Hawkins that organised religion has a lot to answer for and continues maintain ignorance, pain and great loss of life.<br /><br />However Dawkins does massive disservice to science. He breaks the basic rules of science, steps way beyond his own knowledge base, reveals his considerable ignorance of the non-biological science, fails to recognise the beneficial role of religion and in the end does not even accept his own professed atheism.<br /><br />Dawkins expresses but then flagrantly breaks a basic principle of science, parsimony. He professes theories of human behaviour that are more complicated than the behaviour he seeks to explain.<br /><br />Dawkins claims that all our behaviour, even our moral behaviour, is genetically predetermined. Such theories are not just false but dangerous. It should not be surprising that such right wing reactionary theories should re-emerge at a time of war. We should learn the lessons of history. For a reactionary society, there is a simple way to resolve people whose behaviour we do not like and which 'scientists' claim is due to the faulty genes. Essentially Dawkins genetic predetermination is little different in principle to all the previous socio-biology theories that subjugated blacks, women, dissidents, prisoners, children and sent Jews and gypsies to the gas chambers. Darwin would turn in his grave.  Variation is an essential strength of Darwin's prescription for survival of the species.<br /><br />But then Dawkins is not a Darwinian. The essential explanation of Darwin is that the environment outside us, our consequences, selects and shapes the future of our species. Hawkins claims that the essential explanation lies within us and precedes our actions. Our 'Selfish genes'. 'Which came first, the chicken or the egg?' is an age old mind teaser but it is nonsense to claim that the egg or gene has greater power and will than the chicken or human. Hawkins believes in the utter rightness, indeed the righteousness of his theories. He calls for an Evangelical science, a call which breaks yet another basic tenant of science. Another dangerous road to follow both for science and society.<br /><br />Ultimately every human needs some way to cope with the awful truth of human life. That we are born to die and we know it. Dawkins should be aware of another lyric by John Lennon. \\"Whatever gets you through the night, its alright\\". No-one has the right to deny anyone a means of coping with the nightmare, especially when they do not offer any alternative. Hawkins himself wants to keep the option. He gives God a 10% chance of existing. For a scientific atheist, there is no 10% chance, its a black or white question. In this aspect Dawkins is hypocritical. He has neither the humanity nor courage of Hawkins. Hawkins both admits that we may never know but he himself does not think so. Hawkins is a brave man, for he has more right than most to expect a red carpet at the pearly gates.<br /><br />The carpet baggers in religion have used our greatest fear for their own agendas but a non-spiritual society presents equal risks to our future. We have seen the risks of atheism in the communist's gulags. Probably more people have died at the hands of leaders with no God on their side than those with God on their side. In his utter rejection of religion, Dawkins fails to recognise the beneficial role that religion has played in civilising society, laying down society's basic moral and legal codes. Dawkins thereby throws out the good with the bad.<br /><br />I find it somewhat surprising that science has not come to its own defence by exposing the fallacies and risks of Dawkins's unsubstantiated theories.<br /><br />just Jack
B000GFLKF8|2.0|Well, this movie is way too laid back to be real for a bank robbery movie. It's a stupid movie, that's what I'll call it. Washington's performaance is typical of his tyle, like God's speaking to the mass, his sure style just makes everything feel fake and too much acting. The plot is barely Ok. The cop Washington played is just a dumb 3rd grade cop, with more wild guess from nowhere than intelligence. The scene where he walked into Mr. Case's office and accused him lying is just very odd because he has nothing about what happened and why money isn't stolen. And, a small-time cop just walk into a big bank head's office and accuse him lying, just because he hasn't seen money not stolen during a bank robbery before?! Come on, it's cheap and dumb. 2 stars at most. It is worse with Washington's typical over-acting.
0316777722|2.0|maybe its just not my type of humor. i didnt particulary find any of the essays funny enough to laugh out loud, in fact some of them i wondered why others considered them to be funny at all. i read plenty of reviews on the book and the author and was very excited to start reading the book. i am sad to say that i am left very disappointed.
B0001B3YTM|5.0|This is the \\"prequel\\" to the movie Serenity. A year ago, I had no clue what either was (then again I was in Japan...no \\"Fox TV\\" there. <br /> <br />How many TV shows has fans making props from a single episode? Well, do a search online for \\"Jayne Hat\\" and find a ton of hits (one episode, the tough-guy mercenary \\"Jayne\\" gets a letter from his mother and a silly knitted winter hat which he wears throughout the episode, even in a gunfight! Brilliant!) <br /> <br />Fanatical camaraderie between strangers occurs every time I talk about this series of movie in public. Star Wars fans have nothing on this hardcore fandom!
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Gwen's last album was fantastic but, this album really stinks! I have only listened to it once and that is one time too many. I don't think there is one good song on the entire album. The best thing about it is the cover art!
0694013889|5.0|I first tried this with my middle child before he started potty training. He loved it almost instantly. The book helped him become more aware of himself and others and aided his ease into using the toilet. Yes, the \\"chamber pot\\" might not be contemporary, but he still made the connection. My youngest started reading his book and it also has helped her use the potty. But, this might be because \\"she\\" (21months) was much easier to train than my two oldest boys. She's very interested in the book, so I'm ordering the female verson.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Absolutely hands down the best musical to date put to screen.  Zellweger should have won the Oscar for this performance.  It was so bold and unlike anything she has ever done and she pulled off successfully.  Not to worry she would eventually get her Oscar the following year.  Ms. Zeta-Jones defintely earned her acclaim as well as Queen Latifiah.  I think John C. Reilly was definitely overlooked in his performance.  High octane and guarantee to make you tap your feet and snap your fingers this film pure entertainment.  Highly recommended.
0679720200|3.0|All that can be said in praise of this novel has been said on the page already in the other reviews. However, I think it needs to be addressed that this is the newer, \\"americanized\\" translation of the novel and, in my opinion, one would be better off sticking with the original Stuart Gilbert translation that was so satisfactory for so long. Ward's translation seems much too informal, in a tone that seems to ramble and not get across a mood fitting enough for Meursault's character. If at all possible, I recommend finding Gilbert's translation, as, in my opinion, it was much more enjoyable.
B000F8O35U|5.0|this has always been my favorite disney movie, so i am a little biased, but this dvd made the movie even better. it has been digitally remastered and is loaded with special features that i still havent made it all the way through. it is also great for children as well as adults because the story spans across all ages. i highly recommend this dvd if you enjoyed the movie years ago, or if you are just looking for a great family movie with great music!
B000000H57|5.0|This was my first introduction to TON and still my favorite. Forget about it being \\"Goth\\" forget about it being metal, it's just great music.  Peter's voice is one of the most...spiritual experiences ever.  This is a must for any lonely woman. So light some candles, crank it up, and make sure you have plenty of batteries on hand!
B000GW8RVQ|2.0|Awesome incredible performance by the Godfather whom I had the honor and pleasure witnessing live twice in 2006. There never will be another! Why did I rate this particular set so low? The dvd is awesome the companion cd of the show was butchered! There are only 10 songs on the cd and some of them were ridiculously shortened! The entire concert could have been on the cd also. The dvd is about 71 minutes long and the cd was about 37. <br />No excuse for this. Whoever was in charge of producing the cd messed up royally! Save your money and by the single dvd concert it will save you the aggravation and waste of money of the 2 disc set.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|My expectations for this movie was not really high at first. My first impression is that it was a cheap movie from all the movie trailers. <br /> <br />My expectations were wrong. <br /> <br />Although it may not be as deep as the graphic novel, they were able to jam enough details in a span of two hours without making your head spin. It managed to create a good balance of action, storytelling, and character development. Natalie Portman was an excellent actress in this movie and played the role perfectly. <br /> <br />The only downside is that the Wachowski brothers still do not know how to create a romantic scene! From the Matrix trilogy to this, it's unusual how  they create it. <br /> <br />In the end, I recommend it! It's thought provoking, actionpacked, and just plain fun.
0790744295|5.0|I grew up watching this movie whenever and wherever. I like to think that the writers of Creepshow educated me in how to handle life's many problems and keep a smile on my face while doing so. I was amazed at how the remains of Nathan Grantham, the murdered patriarch of the Grantham family, exacted revenge on his ungrateful family, and he even managed to get his Father's Day cake in the end! And for all of you people on the old ball and chain, look at the way in which Henry dealt with his horrifying wife Wilma. This just goes to show us that sometimes, seeminlgy awful situations can work in our favor. Oh, and if you like cockroaches, then this movie is definately for you.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I have enjoyed and enjoyed this album more than any since  <br />\\"Nashville Skyline.\\"
B000002N2N|5.0|This gotta be the best Ramones live album!!!!  It opens with Johnny hit a code and Dee Dee already says \\"One, two....\\" but somehow Joey stopped everything and say, \\"Hey! We are the Ramones and this one's called Rockaway Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeach!!\\"  and just makes you have a huge smile on your face.  This album is so lively and energetic, it makes you forget about all the bad things happened that day.  So I listen to this when coming back from work a lot becuase anything happened that day at work can be washed away and makes me happy!
0743270754|5.0|When I choose a book about a historic character or event of great significance, I desperately want the scholarship and writing to be a match for the topic.  Doris Kearns Goodwin has honored Lincoln admirably in Rivals.<br /><br />By using the word honored, I don't mean she has written a one-sided piece of hero worship; nothing could be further from the truth.  Instead Goodwin captures a full picture of the man, the times in which he lived and the herculean task of keeping the Union together that defines him.  The narrative revolves around the skills, abilities and people Lincoln used so effectively to accomplish a job at which many presidents might have failed.<br /><br />As usual, Goodwin's story-telling draws the reader into the topic and makes you appreciate the achievements and sacrifices of people who lived 150 years ago at a whole different level.<br /><br />To read this book is to experience the greatness of man who had far loftier goals than his own ambition.  Lincoln set himself apart from his peers and eventually won their loyalty by dedicating himself always to principles that transcend generations and borders.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0000041CZ|4.0|There is something amusingly ironic about the phenomenon. Keyboard master Friedrich Gulda plays pieces originally composed by J.S. Bach for beginners on a modern piano that Bach might have felt was a machine lowered from Mars. If he knew about Mars.<br /><br />The result is not historically accurate in any rigid sense of the term. Just superb.<br /><br />That does it for me. This recording is best owned along with a performance on something closer to the 'original instrument'. But it also stands alone as an assertive, modern, tough-minded interpretation of one of Western music's grand deities.<br /><br />No one has ever done fugue like Bach. It is virtually his native musical tongue.<br /><br />Fans of the 1993 film 'The Remains of the Day' (Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Christopher Reeve) will welcome the Prelude #2 in C, though they may not have known at the time whence came that beguiling musical theme from this reviewer's favorite movie.<br /><br />The good folks at Philips Classics (Duo) are once again to be commended for wise choices.
0679746323|1.0|If you are familiar with the history of China in the 20th century, you will find that Mrs. Zhang is telling a story on Mars, not on the earth. Many so-called 'facts' in this book are simply faked by the authors or just from hearsay. Some are even jokes, e.g. the astonishing claim that KMT General Hu is actually a communist spy! The authors reach this surprising conclusion without any solid evidence (most of the proofs therein are without any reference). <br /> <br />Therefore, the only comment I can make on this book is that it is about a history in the authors' mind (or on Mars), not in China, Earth. It is targeted at attacking Mao, not discovering the history. Anyway, it is not bad to regard it as a collection of jokes.
0895260131|5.0|I don't know about y'all, but I have always had some preconceived notions about Islam and Muslims. <br /> <br />I have always believed that Islam was a basically peaceful religion and that the Muslims lands have  <br /> <br />pretty much always (since ancient times) extended from Arabia across North Africa to Morocco, East to Pakistan and across the water to Indonesia, and north to Turkey.   <br /> <br />I never realized how these lands became Muslim... not like Christianity by the use of converts but by war and the poll tax imposed on non-Muslims in Muslim lands.   <br /> <br />I also didn't realize how much of that region was once Christian.  Egypt was to a large extent Christian and was a part of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria (which still exists).  North Africa had many  <br />Christian settlements that were destroyed or taken over when Islam came to their lands.  The Nestorians in Assyria and the Middle East have been reduced to a small fraction of their former Christian numbers. <br /> <br />The Crusades, I was taught in school, were efforts for the Crusaders and Christian Europe to take Jerusalem and many Christian Holy sites in the Levant.  I never realized that much of these lands were Christian to begin with and had been taken from the Muslims.  It could be said that the Crusaders were taking back what had been stolen from them. <br /> <br />Spain was overrun until 1492 when the last of the Moors was expelled.  Two expeditions across the Pyrenees into France were undertaken but the armies were repulsed. <br /> <br />In the east, the Muslims made it to the gates of Vienna Austria and were defeated there.  At the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the combined forces of Venice, Spain, Genoa, the Knights of Malta, Savoy, and the Holy League, defeated the Ottoman Empire fleet.  This battle combined with the Battle of Vienna in 1683 saved Christian Europe from capitulation. <br /> <br />The Koran does not allow for a Muslim truce, unless the Muslims are in aplace of weakness and need a reprieve to regroup.  Eye opening. <br /> <br />I have learned a lot.  I still have a couple Chapters to go, but this is a great book.

068484267X|1.0|I realize I'm in the minority here by not breathlessly extolling the virtues of this book, and I'm quite aware it has been both critically and popularly acclaimed. In fact, that is the only reason I read this book: I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />In my opinion?  Nothing.<br /><br />It brings to mind that wheatgrass juice they sold in the organic section of my grocery store.  People raved about it, but when I drank it, my senses were filled with nothing more than the green liquid that emerges when I rinse the underside of my lawnmower.  In the same way, I can't help but think that people like this book because they are \\"supposed\\" to like it, not because it was in any way enjoyable or stimulating to read.  So, I'll have to go on record as being a literary Philistine when it comes to praise for McCourt's style and Pulitzer Prize-winning story:  Didn't like it.  Didn't get it.<br /><br />In \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" Frank McCourt gives us his memoirs, from toddler to young man, providing a gritty look at what it was to be a child of the Depression.  McCourt paints a picture not of America as a land of dreams, but as a land of broken dreams, where his immigrant parents eventually give up and return from New York to their native Ireland when McCourt is just a small boy.  McCourt then proceeds to give us a recounting of a place even more depressing than the slums of New York: Limerick, Ireland in the 1930s.  Poor, Irish, Catholic, and with completely disfunctional parents, McCourt feels compelled to pour forth every bitterness of his soul from a seemingly bottomless well.  The story closes with McCourt returning to America as a young man, not as an attempt to find the American dream that had eluded his parents, but simply to escape.<br /><br />The more astute among us will ask some very reasonable questions while reading this book: How exactly can the author recall with such vivid clarity the events of his life as a 2- and 3-year-old?  Shouldn't one's memoirs have some purpose...some destination they wish to take the reader rather than just aimless meanderings?  Why are none of the individuals who seemingly played such a huge role in McCourt's life developed more fully and instead portrayed as 1-dimensional Irish stereotypes? Could it be that in McCourt's universe, nobody else was as interesting or deep as himself?  And, why do so many Irish people despise this book rather than regard McCourt as a local Limerick boy who made good?<br /><br />What I emerged with is the story of an individual who lived an admittedly difficult childhood, but then again so did millions of others from the Depression. One does not get the sense he is speaking for all of them; with McCourt, we get the very distinct impression that he is speaking only for himself, and that we had better well feel sorry for him.<br /><br />If you don't require any purpose or well-developed characters in your reading, then perhaps this is the book for you.  If you find it redeeming to read about a childhood that was not only bitter, but as told by someone who is bitter about it, then perhaps this is the book for you.  I can simply say that it wasn't the book for me.<br /><br />I have some rather simple criteria for judging a book:  Did I enjoy it?  Was I a better person for having read it?  To which I must answer quite honestly: No.  In fact, I found this one to be pure drudgery with nothing to offer in the way of education or redeeming content.  McCourt simply plods from heartbreak to heartbreak with mediocre writing and a story that appears to have no real purpose.  Just a sort of \\"life's hard and then you die.\\"  And it is my understanding that although he purports to give us \\"true\\" memoirs, at least some of what he presents here is embellished, if not outright fiction.  There was a whiny, \\"poor me\\" timbre to this book that I found particularly distasteful.<br /><br />Sure, it had a few upbeat moments, but all in all I felt like I'd been given a mouthful of ashes.  I refuse to succumb to the \\"madness of crowds\\" and award this book 5 stars.  I didn't like it, I didn't think it was well written, and what could have come across as a gritty but redeeming ride on what it was to be a child of the Depression came across as simply a collection of mostly bitter recollections.<br /><br />Finally, the book doesn't finish, it just ends.  It was as though McCourt had finally reached the end of his endless repository of depressing memories...or his pen simply ran out of ink.  I realize he published two sequels that perhaps provide more closure to his own life and those of the people who influenced him.  But those books will have to be read by those who actually liked this one.<br /><br />And that would not be me.<br /><br />Footnote: If you'd like to read about an Irish childhood by a truly fine writer, I suggest \\"Portrait of the Author as a Young Man\\" by James Joyce.crowds\\" and award this book 5 stars.

B00003CXXP|5.0|A.I. is one of those movies that has caused much divide between viewers' opinions, and for many varied reasons. It is certainly a movie that is multilayered and can be seen on many levels. <br /> <br />To me, A.I. holds a special place in my heart. It is a masterpiece and ranks alongside those movies that are to be experienced rather than watched and lingers for a long time (it still does after many years). It is a hauntingly beautiful one that has the power to touch the emotional resonance of what makes you truly human. Like Shawshank Redemption (one of my other favourite films) that evokes the power of friendship, hope and redemption; A.I. evokes the power of dreams, love and reunion. Both films utilize the universal theme of the possibilities of completion through the journey of life. <br /> <br />And, I am sure, like other viewers have suggested, that this film will be revisited again sometime in the future and seen in a different light. <br /> <br />The acting is excellent, especially by Haley Joel Osment as David and also Jude Law as Gigolo Joe. <br /> <br />Also worth praising in this film is the musical score by John Williams. For me, it confirms him as the greatest movie score composer in history. The main theme with soprano is hauntingly ethereal, and both sorrowful and soothing at the same time. The piano score is like a lullaby that evokes memories of childhood innocence and purity. <br /> <br />**warning: spoilers here if you have not watched the movie!!** <br /> <br />The movie is about an android boy who has been programmed (in his little silicon soul?) with the goal to love his human parents (in this particular case, his mother) and, simply, to be loved in return. That's all. But, the unexpected happens when their once incurable human son is cured and returns to them so that effectively causes his mother, Monica, to abandon the android robot. So, this is where the real journey begins: on the level of abandonment, loneliness and absence of love. <br /> <br />The android boy, David, begins his quest to return to motherly love again but has to travel through a dangerous world in search for the clues to fulfill his grandest wish. <br /> <br />Many viewers suggested that this film was too long and that the final 3rd of the movie should have been cut, so that David never realises his dream of being loved by his mother. But, in my opinion, that is missing the whole point of this movie. David was programmed with the goal to love and be loved by his mother. His `program' was the reason for his existence. In human terms, it was this heartfelt dream to love that gave him meaning for living, and by only following his dream would it ultimately bring him home to happiness and peace. It was David's unwavering will and faith that eventually fulfilled his dream (complete his program), of course, with the helping of some advanced mechas.  <br /> <br />The 3rd act, to me, completes the cycle of life; not just an A-to-B ending that ends bleakly and without meaning. If you are a cynic, materialist, believe that stories with metaphor has no real meaning, that love has no power and striving for dreams has no value, then pre-3rd act is best where you leave this movie. <br /> <br />For me, the 3rd act moves beyond the the limitations of the physical level and onto the philosophical, metaphorical and spiritual level. David is gifted with a temporary resurrection of Monica so that he can complete his goal. How ironic! First, humans play God to create machines. A machine gradually becomes more human. Humans regress and become more like machines/or animals. Then finally, advanced machines play God to recreate humans! <br /> <br />David not only finally fulfills his mission of loving and in being loved by his mother, he also, through the journey of life begins from android/machine and evolves into what it means to be human: through abandonment, loss of love, hope for reunion, an unwavering will to strive for one's dreams and to have faith no matter what impossible `physical limitations' are against you. A love lost but regained can be one of the most blissful experiences to humans and this is what David eventually experiences. It is his emotional experiences and relationships with humans that transforms him. The very act of loving and in being loved in return makes him human. He realizes a truth told by her at the end: that he was `always loved'. Time and space (even 2000 years) had no power over his dream to love and be loved. Although initially seemingly futile, in reality it was only a temporary barrier as proved by the completion of his goal, and he is finally able to do what a machine cannot: to dream. <br /> <br />The transformation from machine to human and finally transcending that condition to finally reach ultimate truth is, to me, what this film is about. Again, how ironic it is that it takes a `machine' to teach us what it means to be `human'. At the end, David returns home to `Where dreams are born'...the realm of the eternal, spirit and soul? <br /> <br />It is a bitter-sweet ending. Bitter on the physical; sweet on the metaphysical. <br /> <br />By the way, did you know that `AI' in Japanese actually means `love'?
0743289412|3.0|Definitely not one of King's best, LS's characterization--particularly of female characters--is consistently stunning for its insights & detail. Language--people's ways of speaking--remain a strong suit. In this novel, the actual plot is wholly subservient to dialogue & characterization. Jim Dooley's speech is written in accents of the West & South; he is portrayed as a powerful, violent, but ultimately dumb guy who has to resort to calling women bitches & violating them physically. However, when Lisey or Amanda or Scott or Sparky use strong language, it's held on another plane, that of worldliness & fearlessness, proving that language (alone) does not make the man or woman; intent does. King's characters are usually fairly clearly good or evil, with the happy exception of Scott Landon's family, who must do socially difficult, even reprehensible things to prevent even worse things from happening. They are allowed, nay compelled, to break the rules. In a sense, they thus show that despite their mental illness, they have moral courage, and thus the reader can accept & even feel deeply for (if not with) them.  <br /> <br />For most King fans, Lisey's Story may be way too \\"slow\\" or even not particularly interesting. Portions of what happens are gleaned from Lisey's memories of when her husband was still alive, but King manages to make it fresh & timely. He has great humanity & empathy for the women and for Scott--so much so that one begins to wonder how much of this \\"story\\" is really Lisey's and how much is Stephen's!?! <br /> <br />We finally get `Lisey's Story' (Scott's final confession to his long-patient & beloved wife) at the very end of the book, when all the meager plot has been exhausted, but by then it's kind of anticlimactic...and undeserving of the bold text with underlining to stress Scott's emphases to Lisey. (Give us some credit, Stephen, for being able to read the text with your intended highlights. Also, on the device of personalizing so many family expressions is taken a bit far in the book. We get it!) It is here that Scott finally confesses his parricide, but by that time, anybody could have guessed it: Sparky had to kill the physical Paul & his son Scott had to kill the physical Sparky. The dangerous family derangement cannot be allowed to be passed on; worse yet, it may not exist at all. In a black & white world, such a deus ex machina solution (I almost cried when King resorted to the unbelievable in The Green Mile) might be acceptable. King's many sophisticated readers require considerably more unique, clever--and usually less supernatural--solutions. It's high time for Stephen King to evolve out of the horror genre that has made him a rich & popular writer and try the Great American Novel on for size. I for one am sure it would fit him wonderfully.  <br />
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I agree with those who point out that this must be seen as an approximation of how Superman II would have been had Donner been allowed to complete the movie, rather than a perfect release of that film. Using the footage that was available, this film was superbly reconstructed as well as it possibly could be. The effects fit seamlessly with the original footage, and the attention to detail is very impressive.<br /><br />I am probably most satisfied by the fact that one of the biggest plot holes in movie history has been explained (how Superman got his powers back after giving them up.) It's not a great explanation, but at least it tries to be.<br /><br />There is of course the final scene, in which a terrible gaff in continuity is made re: the turning back of time. I've decided to forgive it.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great revision of a classic movie. Though neither is perfect, and neither really match the near-perfection of the first Superman movie, I'm happy to say I like both versions.
B000009HF2|5.0|Ahhhhhh...1976...America was celebrating its 200th birthday, Farah Fawcett hairdos were all the rage, everyone wore either pooka shells or a mood ring (or both) and this album was EVERYWHERE.<br /><br />I was eleven years old.<br /><br />I remember sitting in the garage of my aunt's house listening to this album with my significantly older cousins. We'd have the garage door shut and Mike would light incense so that his mom, my aunt wouldn't smell the.....uhm, the biscuits that we were baking, in the garage...well, maybe it wasn't biscuits, but something was getting baked.<br /><br />I just remember shutting my eyes while the music was going and feelung like everything was just this weird and wonderful dream. The music just kept on going and going even though I knew that my cousin periodically pulled himself up from the avocado colored beanbag he was sitting on to change the record. This music just seemed to register into my pre-teen brain. It even made me want to take guitar lessons even though my dad insisted that I should learn a more \\"practical\\" instrument first and then move on to the guitar.<br /><br />Since when is the accordian practical?<br /><br />But I never learned to play either of those instruments. Kind of sad, really. But cue up Show Me the way and I play a real mean Fender \\"air-caster\\". This album is just loaded with gems and even though later on, I was informed that a lot of stuff was done in a recording studio with stadium effects put in later, it still didn't sour my memories any.<br /><br />I had this on vinyl and my friend at the time begged me to let him borrow it, after much pleading and promising, I succumbed to his whining. He promptly left it on the seat of his truck on a 105 degree Southern California Summer day. Oh, the carnage. He didn't even offer to replace it. He just told me it was an unfortunate accident. No, his mom not keeping her legs closed 20 years ago was an unfortunate accident. I did find another copy in a used record store, but it's still not MY copy. My copy had vibrations of my love, my joy, my gladness seeping through the album cover onto the album itself. The album that I was now holding had vibrations of someone desperate for a little cash money to buy their next beer so in their desperation they pawned this record for a buck...maybe even less. There's no love coming from this. Only desperation.<br /><br />So I bought a CD version. Still not the same. At least it's mine, though. My little nephews get a kick out of this music.

It makes me proud that I was able to provide them with some groovy music for some groovy memories later on.<br /><br />Not too long ago I asked my cousin whatever happened to his vinyl version of this recording. Tears welled up in his eyes as he recounted a very sad tale of him being so desperate one night for cash.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|It's great to be able to see a movie that doesn't rely on special effects and blood-curdling violence.  \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a movie for the grown-ups among us who are struggling with what they think they ought to be as opposed to what society tells us we ought to be. This isn't \\"Meet the Fockers,\\" ok? <br /> <br />As I watched the scenes among the very dysfunctional family, I had flashbacks of my own family life.  We're not close but, like the Hoovers, we hang together when things get rough.  All of us have run into road blocks (literal and spiritual) just like the Hoovers.  Like the scene when they're trying to desperately to get to the hotel for the pageant but can't find the exit...it's there, they can see the hotel, they just can't figure out how to get there. <br /> <br />The performances are brilliant.  Greg Kinnear's facial expressions while watching the Little Miss Sunshine pageant should earm him many awards. <br /> <br />

B00005JP9V|5.0|What it is about:<br /><br />Children of men is shows us a desolate future where women are unable to have children.  The despair and ruin this causes is unimaginable.  The known world is torn apart by terrorism, political rebellion, a holocaust of sorts where all refugees are treated worse than animals and sent to live in camps and shipped back to where they came from.  In this depressing dreary world we have Theo an ex activist who is pretty much just going through the motions. His ex wife a political activist enlists his help to deliver a pregnant girl to a secretive group.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />It is a fabulously done movie.  The story and the cinematography are amazing.  Some shots are so amazing you wonder if it was a single take or how the director did it.  There is a lot of action in this movie.  The intensity is so in your face you feel like you are there.  The funny thing is this isn't supposed to be an action movie per se. but the movie is so intense and exciting you feel like it is an action movie.  The movie never lets up until the end.<br /><br />The supportive cast is also very good.  Michael Caine as a friend of Theo is amazingly great.  His character is funny and balances out Theo's darkly somber self.<br /><br />It is a very good movie with lots of meaning and really makes you think about politics, future while actually enjoying the movie.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The movie doesn't really follow the book.  It just took the premise of a chaotic world of infertility so you won't find a page by page comparison of the book and the movie.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This is an excellent film that can be enjoyed by all.  The film is rated R for intense scenes of violence.  But the violence I feel is actually a realistic view of a world without hope.  Yes there is a message in this movie about immigration, terrorism, tolitarian government etc. the movie is still exciting within itself.  It is a must see movie.
B00007KWHN|5.0|After working with an orchestra on Time and Word (1970) and parting company with former guitarist Peter Banks, Yes joined forces with staggering virtuoso guitarist Steve Howe and took a massive leap forward into the world of full blown prog.  Although I do not wish to offend Peter Banks fans, I just really appreciate Steve's playing more and feel that he brought a great deal to Yes.  The Yes Album (1971) shows the classic Yes group sound starting to take shape, which would come to full and glorious fruition one year later with Close to the Edge (1972).  The Yes Album however stands as their first creative (and yes, commercial) success.<br /><br />The musicians on this album include Jon Anderson (vocals; percussion); Chris Squire (Rickenbacker bass; vocals); Steve Howe (acoustic and electric guitars; vachalia; vocals); Bill Bruford (drums; percussion); and Tony Kaye (Hammond organ; piano; and mini-moog).  This would be Tony Kaye's last album with Yes and would be replaced by none other than the keyboard wizard himself Rick Wakeman on the follow-up album Fragile (1972).  With most of the classic lineup in place, the level of the musicianship on The Yes Album went up as did the quality of the pieces themselves.  In spite of this, The Yes Album is still just a very sophisticated rock album, without necessarily being progressive in the sense that Close to the Edge and Relayer (1974) were progressive.<br /><br />The six tracks on the album range in length from 3'03\\" (Steve's acoustic solo piece Clap) to 9'23\\" (Starship Trooper).  Starship Trooper really is a fantastic piece and as I recall, brought the record into the after school jazz band rehearsal to share my love of Starship Trooper with everybody else.  One of things that I like about this track is the level of emotion that it imparts.  In fact that is what a lot of Yes music was about - sweeping emotion - a property that is featured to varying degrees on all Yes albums right up until 1977 or so.  Steve's acoustic solo piece \\"Clap\\" is also excellent and was recorded live (the bonus tracks include the studio version which is just as good).  I guess it's worth noting that somebody added a \\"The\\" onto \\"Clap\\" and Steve has had to deal with that embarrassing title to this day.  Fortunately Rhino had the good sense to correct this.  Perpetual Change is a great piece along with the underrated A Venture, which features some excellent playing by Chris.  In fact, his solo consists of simply adjusting the pickup switch to shift from the warmer sound of both the \\"treble\\" and \\"bass\\" pickups (I am not going to go into detail about string length and frequency) to a sharp and trebly sound using just the treble pickups.  Although simple, it is incredibly effective.<br /><br />This remastered and expanded album by Rhino is simply excellent.  It features well-written and insightful liner notes by Dr. Bill Martin (Philosophy/DePaul University)(his book Music of Yes: Structure and Vision in Progressive rock is superb) and loads of band photos.  The bonus tracks are OK and include a few single versions along with the studio version of Steve's acoustic guitar solo piece Clap.<br /><br />All in all, this album marks the beginning of a creative peak for Yes that would last until 1977.  Very highly recommended along with Fragile; Close to the Edge; the live Yessongs (1973); Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973); Relayer (1974); Going for the One (1977); and the live Yesshows (1980).

B00005JPDP|5.0|I read Patrick Suskind's Perfume when it was published in English in 1986.  When I heard over the years that a movie version was planned I never thought it would become reality.  I was always a little uncertain how Grenouille would be presented since he is hardly a hero.  The film is an excellent adaptation of the book with a remarkable performance by Ben Whishaw as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.  Mr. Whishaw manages to convey the \\"otherness\\" of Grenouille; a feeling he conveys that he is different and an outsider.  He is relegated to his own world of smells and has no need to communicate with people.  The gaunt appearance that Mr. Whishaw achieves is perfect for his character.  It is equally interesting to see his passions aroused when he first detects the scent of a young woman selling fruit.  He truly comes alive and when he accidentally kills the girl his reaction is like a child that has killed a favorite pet; he does not know that he has done anything wrong: he had to relish the scent of the girl.     Dustin Hoffman makes an interesting Giuseppe Baldini.  His nose is perfect for a perfumer and he does quite well with the role although his accent does not sound terribly Italian.  Alan Rickman is superb as Antoine Richis and Rachel Hurd-Wood, as his daughter Antoine Richis, is very attractive and entirely convinces you that she is an intelligent young woman who would rather do without marriage to the well-meaning but much older Marquis de Montesquieu.     The supporting cast is excellent and beautifully fit into their characters.  The production is first rate and is entirely convincing from the start that you are in 18th century France with all of its squalor and filth.  The CGI effects are quite good, particularly the bridge where Baldini has his shop.  John Hurt lends his mellifluous voice to the film as the narrator, helping to fill us in on Grenouille's workings and motives.    If you have read the book I think you will enjoy the film unconditionally.  For people who have not read the book, I hope you will find the experience a journey of the imagination.  While this is not a morality tale perhaps the moral of this story is that we cannot live (as Grenouille understands in the end) without love and be whole.
B00005JP9V|2.0|Good director, decent story, interesting ideas, good actors. That's about it though. This movie can't seem to figure itself out. I like movies that make the viewer think, but this movie had too much extra junk thrown in the audience's face. It didn't need all the conflict, ridiculous and comical chase sequences, and near-death experiences. The jump-start escape scene was laughable and the point where this film went downhill. Julianne Moore is a fine actress but can't play this role in which she was cast. Do they think a nose ring can instantly turn her into a rebel? I give it 2 stars because, like I said, I like movies that make the viewer think, but this one ended 20 minutes into it for me.
B000002H33|5.0|What can I say... I am not a big fan of thrash metal... no not at all. Actually when I first heard Master Of Puppets... that was around 1987, I think... I was absolutely disgusted and my ears couldn't take it. No really. For some strange reason this is no longer true now, almost twenty years later. Perhaps I became half-deaf from all the other music but around mid 1990s I began to appreciate Metallica more, right around the time they issued S&M. Anyway, back to the review. Ride The Lightning was the breakthrough but the guys didn't perfect the art yet. On this album, only \\"Leper Messiah\\" is a throwaway, IMHO. The title track is a masterpiece, \\"The Thing That Shouldn't Be\\" is another favorite, and the ending track (which made my ears bleed in 1987) grew on me as well. The album is a very unified and consistent effort. Also, what is very important to me, you can actually listen to it - I mean both melody and lyrics. On a lot of thrash records by likes of Megadeth, Bathory etc. you cannot hear either - the metal guitar riffs are basically killing everything else (as it is probably intended for some but I am not that kinda guy). <br />  And melody/lyrics here are pretty good... not just \\"for a metal album\\" but simply good. Title track and \\"Welcome Home\\" are the lyrical standouts of the record although the main idea is more or less the same on all the tracks.
0060899190|5.0|When I received my box of books the other day containing Frank Warren's \\"PostSecret,\\" I had no intention of sitting down and actually reading it right then.  I guess I had no choice; the back cover pulled me in, the foreword and introduction led me to that first postcard, and I was hooked.  This is easy reading as far as page-turners go, and quick!  The trick, however, is in getting the words and images out of your head once you put the book down.  And the message?  You're not alone.  Now, maybe that's clich&eacute; nowadays, but that doesn't make it less true.  I know that I feel, I don't know, a little more connected knowing that I could've written any of a dozen or so of the post cards--the humorous as well as the darker ones.  As my subject heading states, I recommend that everybody take a look at Warren's \\"PostSecret\\"--there's definitely something for each of us to identify with in it.
B000H5U832|5.0|Cars was such a great movie!!  It is defineately for ALL ages.  There are some inside jokes for adults, funny movements for the kids, action, romance, some scientific reasoning (in turning).  The movie covers it all!  It is especially good if you know ahead of time who the voices are.  Most of us know at least one of the actors doing the voices.  It is a movie to have in your collection!
0307276902|3.0|It took about a page or two for me to get used to the writing style in James Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces\\"--it was different and I liked it (it's why I gave this a 3 star rating).  However, what I found disconcerting was how Frey's style and his language kept this reader at arm's length.  I wanted to feel for these characters, wanted to do more than frown at appropriate times, but I just couldn't connect.  Because of that, admittedly, I only read the first few chapters of \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" and as such, my review can't be considered anything resembling comprehensive.  I simply wanted to make my possibly-skewed opinion known.  Maybe, if I'm in the mood at a later date, I'll finish this book, but for now?  This will be one of those rare books that I just won't make myself read to the end.
0743564170|4.0|We (my wife and I) \\"read\\" this book on audio CD, while on a car trip.  We didn't want to stop.  And when we did, we usually waited for a chapter to end before turning off the audio.  This is a book you won't want to put down.  So make sure you start reading, when you have the time to complete the book.  The conclusion leaves a lot to the imagination, and could have been stronger - but who cares, the tale is so well written!
B00005JPE7|5.0|As was the case for many Rocky fans, on first hearing of this new installment in the Rocky franchise I was very uncertain as to its affectiveness in advancing the story. However, I was completely wrong in my expectation of the film. Rocky Balboa is I think, the second best installment in the series, second only to the first film which exuded pasion, devotion, love, and the ideal of beliving in one-self despite the odds. Rocky Balboa, like the first film was an honest exploration of the human condition. It shows a man who had found and lost both the love of his life and professional success, but despite the apparent bleakness of his life is able with heart and the love and support of his family and friends to find happiness and peace of mind.     Way to go Mr. Stallone, you nailed this one on the head.    Rocky Balboa is a truely great movie experience and I recomend it to anyone and everyone, especially Rocky fans big and small.
0375704027|5.0|the title seems especially appropriate - as with music, the impression of this book upon the emotional reader's memory is strong and lasting - and will almost certainly be recalled many times at the mere mention of a simple image or series of words.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Now, admittedly I am a biased source, especially considering the A&E version is among my top five movies of all time. But I'm not so blind that I completely fail to see how Keira Knightley got an oscar nomination for this!!!  <br />    This person CAN'T act! She's a one-dimensional, moderately attractive girl who seems to think she's still in the twenty-first century. This is a PERIOD piece--not another Bend it Like Beckham. While she can get away with her harder-edged tomboy in that (and I give her credit for that) that doesn't change the fact that her transistion to early nineteenth century is completely graceless. And unfortunately--the movie definitely had potential--it sinks the ship completely. <br />    To be fair, McFayden shares the blaim: his portrayal of Darcy is NOT Jane Austen's Darcy (I spent the entire time convinced that he was about to burst into tears. Please, get a backbone!) He can hardly convince us that he'd do half the things he's said to have done when he's about to keel over--all that sinning must have weighed down that sensitive soul of his. <br />    If you haven't seen the A&E version, you might like this. But every SINGLE person who's seen both--even those who fervently defended this movie--have been converted entirely after seeing the other version. If you love Jane Austen and want a faithful (and actually FUNNY) representation of her world, you have to see Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle in order to get an idea of what it's SUPPOSED to be like. You'd never know it's five hours, and that's a credit to not only the stars but the supporting characters too. <br />   But PLEASE, someone give that poor girl acting lessons!
B0000399WI|5.0|This is my personal favorite Stephen King film adaptation.  It is a story of the incredible patience of a secretive and intense individual in the face of incredible hardship.  Others of his friends lose the ability to be happy in freedom but the intrepid Robbins character never loses sight of responsibilities and rewards of freedom.  Morgan Freeman, always an asset to a film, is at his best in a supporting role that shines forth without robbing the plot.
1569242739|5.0|Five stars is not enough for this wonderful (and absolutely cute looking) recipe book.  Many books don't have full color pics of the finished product... this one has lots and lots... which inspire you to actually make the cupcakes instead of just drooling over the possibility that they might come out well.  Seeing images of the finished products are a big bonus. <br /> <br />I have been vegetarian for over 40 years and vegan now for nearly 6.  Vegan desserts and cakes have always been the most difficult part of the vegan diet to equal the eggs and dairy bit.  Now with VCTOTW there is no excuse for not creating absolutely perfect, tasty, delicious, wonderful... you get the picture... cupcakes.  More power to the authors - they deserve the Vegan Order of Merit for outstanding service to vegans!
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp's ability as an actor is key to making this one a well-done adaptation of the Stephen King multiple personality disorder psycho-thriller.  Like many King stories, this one is not so much the terror but the depth of the story that gives it it's appeal.  It is an aspect difficult to capture on film, as opposed to print, but still succeeds in this case.
0688014291|5.0|1 minute goal, 1 minute praising, and 1 minute reprimand can help you not only on your career but also in your personal life. This is a short book and very easy to read. The main idea is knowing what your outcome, catching people doing things right, catching people doing things wrong. Simple but convincing. At the end of the book, it does explain why these things work and why people function these way. Pleasure reading in 2 hours. Very helpful and practical!    For the CD audio book version, it also includes an interview with Dr. Spencer Johnson about where did the 1 minute manager's idea come from and how did Dr. Johnson apply the idea on his daily life.     (Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 07-Jan-2007)
B0000A98ZP|5.0|For anyone who is under the age of 8 or who has been serving time in a space prison on Pluto, \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is one of the most brilliant films ever made that literally spoke to an entire generation. It sits on my and my friends top 10 list of the greatest film achievements of all time. It is cinematic genuise and John Hughes, with his brilliant eye for the youth in film, portrays teenage life in the 80's better than anyone has ever done. The Breakfast Club is quintessential art, and will stand the test of time long after the cast is old and grey. A Classic. Period.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Watch this film and pass it to others, the message is important for the future of our civilization here on Planet Earth.  I nearly skip it, thinking it would be another of those boring documentaries, luckily, I did not.  Al Gore presents his fact in an engaging fashion, and the whole shows really hits a nerve.  I was never bored during the entire presentation. It shows the frightening future that our children will face if we do not act now, while we can.   Here's hoping that this film catches on globally, so that everyone will know what is at stake here.  Note, that as Al Gore states in his presentation, this is not rumor and fear mongering.  The danger is real, and the consequence can be as near as in our lifetime, and that there is not a single dissenting opinion in the scientific world.   Watch it and judge...better yet, watch it and act....now!
068485743X|5.0|It was very interesting to see the inner workings of the rejection industry.  Nonetheless, he has outstanding recommendations for tightening up and adding punch and impact.    While it might be frustrating if you're the next Pynchon or Tom Robbins to know that you'll never get past the gatekeepers, you can at least concede the first five pages to get their attention.    I originally picked this up at the library but decided it was a keeper.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I received this CD for Christmas, and it has quickly and easily become my favorite Christmas CD! James Taylor's mellow voice is so smooth and soothing, and this glorious collection of songs fit him very well. There are a few well-known artists that joined in the effort, making this collection very special, namely, Chris Botti on trumpet in \\"Winter Wonderland\\", and Toots Theilemans on harmonica for \\"Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire\\", and of course, most notably, Natalie Cole in \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" ... my personal favorite song on the entire CD. James Taylor's voice with Natalie Cole's voice produce some sort of beautiful magic! I've listened to that song over and over, and it still gives me goosebumps! James Taylor sings with his whole heart and soul. I highly recommend this CD ... you will not be disappointed!
B000IJ79WU|4.0|... because it is an unfinished work that was not finished by Donner let alone edited or cleaned up by Donner. This is merely a compilation of all the footage he shot (and it's almost an entirely new film on it's own) and NOT a finished, effects ready, cleaned up, edited and polished film that one would expect from Donner in the theater. It's a warts and all, screen test footage and all, you can see the wires and all, film that gives the die hard Superman film fan the direction Richard intended to go. To spend any time \\"critiquing\\" it as you would a finished film or comparing it's merits vs. the theatrical release is pointless... so don't waste your time. If you're a die hard fan, and you know who you are, you'll want this. If you're a casual fan - rent it.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris, \\"The End of Faith,\\" has given us a reasoned - I am tempted to say profound - look at the Abrahamic religions as the proximate cause of the terrorist wars in the Middle East and elsewhere.  His book is strong stuff, with no politically correct waffling. It should be required reading at the highest levels of government - especially among those who believe terrorism is a reaction to Western aggression and can be defused through pacifism and appeasement. <br /> <br />Harris' assessment of the religion cum terrorism problem and its immensity is disquieting, but he offers a prescription. One that might seem utopian, but in his hands it seems doable and our best hope. He calls, no less, for religious faith to be replaced by a science of ethics to be founded upon research into mind and consciousness. Presumably to avoid an authority-based approach, he proposes the empirical methodologies of the East for examining mind and consciousness. Weird stuff for some, but as a neuro-scientist his proposal invokes its own credibility. He suggests the transformation might be accomplished in one generation. <br /> <br />Harris is clearly science-minded, but he is no mere technocrat. His philosophical approach, acceptance of non-Western ideas and his acknowledgments of the sacred demonstrate a larger view of life than that offered by science alone. Still, he stops short of speculating on where an empirical science of consciousness might lead - as is prudent. I feel compelled to wonder if he might share physicist Irwin Schroedinger's (\\"The Oneness of Mind\\") vision of Eastern universal mind and its potential as divinity. <br /> <br />I look forward to Harris' next offering. <br />
B00005JPDY|4.0|In director Robert DeNiro's ambitious film, the professional rise and spiritual fall of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) through the ranks of the CIA reflects the evolution of that organization from its creation in the wake of WWII until the debacle at the Bay of Pigs.  The character of Wilson is much like the film itself: enigmatic, quiet, and tightly controlled.  Some may be put off by the long running time and the lack of big action scenes, but more patient viewers will be rewarded with a compelling presentation of the psychological damage caused when mistrust is the normal state of human interaction.  Wilson emerges as a tragic figure, having gone into government service with the best of intentions but, step by step, coming to the point where he becomes responsible for horrific acts. <br /> <br />DeNiro does a fine job in his second film as a director.  He has assembled an excellent cast, including some outstanding cameos. <br />

0618680004|3.0|Like all of Dawkins's books this is very well-written, but unlike his other works it doesn't actually say anything new. The basic argument he uses against God's existence must have occurred to any reasonably-intelligent teenager. It's none other than the \\"if God created the world, who created God?\\" question spread over a whole book. Another problem is that Dawkins addresses his topic with a zeal which can only be described as religious. He accuses believers of twisting the evidence but then does exactly the same himself. For instance, most of the examples of religious disputes leading to war which he cites are actually national or racial conflicts. Dawkins must know that the Catholics don't hate the Protestants in Northern Ireland because they reject the Pope's authority. They hate them because they believe that Scottish immigrants four hundred years ago had no right to Irish land. IRA terrorists are not renowned for their religious piety! The same could be said for the other supposedly religious wars he cites. And if it's true that religion causes war, why is it that the records for mass murder are held by atheistic regimes like Communist Russia, China and Cambodia? <br />Dawkins dismisses those scientists who believed in God in the past because he says a profession of religious faith was expected in those days. He even says Isaac Newton might have been in this group, but doesn't mention that Newton spent more time studying the Bible than he did physics. Of course, perhaps Newton spent so much effort on the laws of motion and the nature of the Trinity that he didn't notice the \\"who created God\\" question! Duh! <br />Like all evangelical atheists, Dawkins pretends that it is possible to obtain spiritual sustenance by contemplating the wonders of the universe. What he is essentially saying is \\"don't worry that you and your friends and family will die and you won't exist for ever and ever and ever, just look at that pretty butterfly. Isn't it wonderful that it evolvedthanks to millions of years of unconscious natural selection.\\" Speaking as an atheist myself, I'm underwhelmed. <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|\\"An inconvenient truth\\", directed by Davis Guggenheim, allows you to watch a lecture about global climate change that Al Gore has given many times, in different parts of the world. Strangely enough, it is not boring, and even though the subject is somewhat complicated, Gore manages to make it accessible to the spectator.<br /><br />Al Gore is entertaining and patient with his audience, saying that \\"It is just human nature to take time to connect the dots. I know that. But I also know that there can be a day of reckoning when you wish you had connected the dots more quickly\\". According to him, climate change and how we react to it is ultimately not a political issue so much as a moral issue. Once you are aware of what is happening, and realize that climate change is not just a \\"theory\\", you will have to act, because there is just no other option. Either you are part of the problem, or one of those trying to find a solution.<br /><br />I strongly believe that this dvd should be seen by everybody, because it tackles a difficult subject that concerns us all, that is climate change and the way in which it is affecting our planet. Disregarding your political ideas or the place where you live, there are some disturbing facts that you won't be able to deny any longer, even if they lead to an inconvenient truth.<br /><br />In the last few minutes of this movie, Al Gore says that he set himself a goal, to try to communicate clearly what he has learnt about global climate change. Congrats on a well-done job, Mr. Gore! And thanks...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000JJRIN4|4.0|when i first heard wind it up, i must admit i didn't really like it. but i found that it got stuck in my head. i listened to a few more tracks online and decided to buy the album. it has grown on very much, and it has become my workout soundtrack. <br /> <br />YES- it is a big departure from no doubt. but why bother going solo if you are going to put out the same stuff as you do with your band? she got to have a bit of fun, get into some different styles.  <br /> <br />i love no doubt and am anxiously awaiting their new album, but this is a fun album in the meantime.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Anyone looking at this DVD set of all 12 episodes most likely knows the series, and has seen part or all of it somewhere else.  If not, what rock have you been under?  I saw this series first on American PBS in 1982 and was struck by the brilliant writing, physical acting and clever dynamic of the cast.  At the time America only turned out sitcoms filled with dull jokes, tepid characters, heavily inflated laugh tracks, or the Fonz striking poses as the crowd wailed mercilessly in rapture.  Stale.  Amazingly, classmates of mine in high school at the time claimed it was boring and couldn't understand the plots.  And they were never heard of again. <br /> <br />This 70's BBC series is classic, and a must have for any comedy lover.  Dated, but it has its place.  Much of the writing and comedic action is still leaps ahead of modern fare, despite being one of the cheapest series produced at the time by the BBC (in 1974). <br /> <br />Shows are uncut and unadulterated.  No special correction or computer fixes to small imperfections.  Thank god.  It is a very classy and straight forward package.  Mr. Davies and Mr. Spiers provide commentary tracks which are nearly to sleep by.  Davies is mostly quiet, and his gurgling stomach is constantly providing commentary while Spiers is heard endlessly drinking, smoking or exercising Restless Leg Syndrome.  And it sounds like it was shot in someone's spare bedroom.  Still good for a one time listen by fans of the series, but not worth it if you just like the shows and don't care about where cameras were position, or how long make up took.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I thought I'd add my two cents to all the other reviews.  I rented \\"North and South\\" this week for the first time and was blown away!  It's wonderful!  It has now overtaken \\"A Room With A View\\" as my favorite period piece! I'm going to have to purchase it. The cinematography is breathtaking. I love the scene where Margaret walks into the mill for the first time and the cotton is swirling in the air like snow.  You will not be disappointed in this one. It will be loved for many, many years to come!
B000056QD7|2.0|It's another album of mediocre songs designed to have Britney shake her halfnaked body on MTV.  Britney's voice is just odd.  Unlike that tonedeaf Alanis Morissette, Britney can actually hit the notes but her voice..well..it's...um... it's just not very good.  It's just an ordinary voice singing a bunch of mediocre songs.  Just like Morissette, Britney's key to success is her packaging.  In the case of Alanis, she's billed as an \\"angry female\\" (it's own tired genre) while Britney's packaging is literally her packaging (something that clearly can't be said about Alanis!).  It looks great, but you can easily look at it while listening to something else. <br /> <br />I bought this CD for the karaoke tracks because \\"fixing\\" these songs in karaoke is an incredible amount of fun.
0440180295|4.0|There were many bright ideas in here. The Tralfamadorian ability to see all points of life, which made death a nonissue; Billy Pilgrim's ability to time travel; his abduction and placement in a controlled environment, suggesting our vulnerability to distorted or incomplete information; war commentary from the mouth of a vet- the confused notion of \\"meaning\\" in life when war unwincingly slaughters little girls in pigtails. I also read \\"Timequake\\" and I'm intrigued by Vonnegut's recurrent use of time travel. There is much to be said about experience and memory as related to time, and I enjoy reading Vonnegut's plain, witty, cigarette style. I basically just went along for the ride on this read, but I intend on reading again later to extract a deeper brilliance.
B000FILW86|4.0|This was, without a doubt, my main \\"go to\\" album of 2006.  When I was scrounging for something to listen to and just didn't know what to turn to, when I needed a lift, when I was in a good mood, when I was in a bad mood, whatever the occasion, this album was IT.  Rockford delivered every time.  Full of exactly what you always hope for in a Cheap Trick outing - incredible hooks, great, catchy songwriting, and Robin Zander's incredible voice.  There isn't a flaw on the damned thing.  I had a hard time not calling this album of the year, actually.
0783227434|5.0|The first viewing I had of this movie was many a year ago.  I was angry at my roommates, grumpy and tired.  A friend had loaned me this movie.  Being bored I put it in.  It immediately turned my mood around.  I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  It is cheesey and oh so funny.  I do not appreciate gore unless it is used appropriately, this movie takes gore to a whole new genre.   <br /> <br />A few years later I had forgotten to try to find it.  Then one day I saw it and immediately bought it.  It was just as good as I had remembered.  What can I say, if you are in an odd mood for a good, funny and scary movie, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br />As one other reviewer said, this is the third in the series, but I never realized that until recently.  The movie stands on its own two feet (and one chainsaw!)
B000GPIPVU|4.0|I admit it.  For whatever reason, I find myself drawn to Van Morrison-esque singers, yet I don't particularly enjoy Van The Man himself.  Add Lamontagne to that list.  There's something hypnotic about the darkness that surrounds this album, and it's not just the black album cover - the music is dramatically draped in low strings that compliment Lamontagne's husky, smokey voice.  Modern, yet timeless, Until The Sun Turns Black feels like the kind of album that will never get old.
B00005JOLI|4.0|I thought it was a great movie. It isn't as deep as say LOTR etc but I enjoyed it very much, however I had not read the books so I am guessing that has a huge impact on my liking it :)<br /><br />So if you have not read the books, I think the movie is wonderful. I love the dragon, love her voice and how they made her look.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Knopfler's throaty rumble and Harris' angelic lilt seem too perfect and, in places, the album comes across a bit glib in nature, but when it works it's absolutely wonderful.
B00005M91K|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said in the hundreds of positive reviews of this art-movie-music-dvd?<br /><br />It is amazing. The footage of the Balinese Monkey chant alone makes the film worth seeing. And then there are so many other interesting things, people, and cultural snapshots... it is a smorgasbord of interesting and amazing people and places and rituals and life on planet Earth.<br /><br />My only complaint is that part of the 2nd half of the film, where modern day \\"civilized\\" humans enter the picture, is too long, ugly and boring... I realize the idea was to contrast and compare the cultures of more primitive people and the cultures of modern peoples, but I found the modern people boring and unpleasant, and that part of the film goes on a bit too long.<br /><br />The film does make you think about who we human beings are and how we are all connected, and yet also different; how modern people seem to have lost their connection their own humanity, and to nature; and how we are desroying the life-support system we depend on... This could also have been called \\"Koyannisquatsi\\" (life out of balance), but I guess that title was already taken. (-;<br /><br />The soundtrack is superb, and the images are beautiful. I can't imagine any dialogue that would have made the movie better.<br /><br />I think everyone should see this movie. Then you'll probably want to buy it.
B00005JOSS|2.0|There's a Korean movie I saw several years ago (2000) which left a lasting impression on me.  It was called \\"Il Mare\\" and was about a man and a woman who are both living at the same lake house but in different times.  Sound familiar? \\"Il Mare\\" was restrained, romantic, tragic, really beautiful, with a bittersweet ending that lingered in the mind long after the movie was over.  Despite knowing full well that Hollywood is great at taking brilliant foreign movies and remaking mediocre dumbed down versions of them for American audiences, I still went to see \\"The Lake House.\\"  As expected they ruined it.  I guess they figured the original Korean ending was not \\"happy enough\\" for US audiences!  Whatever.  Anyway, don't take my word for it, go see the original.
B00005JPDS|4.0|I'm not a big Will Smith fan, but he is very good here and deserves his Golden Globe nomination. His real life son, who plays his son in the film, is much better than I thought he would be. I thought the whole movie would be feel good and sappy, but most of it is a real downer. At least it ends on a good note. I'm glad I saw it, but if I wasn't so bored today, I could have waited for it to hit DVD.
0307346609|4.0|It suprises me that i rated this book a 4 out of 5.  I picked this book up because i was bored and needed something to do.  I was very impressed at how well written this book was.  The plot thickens in a very unique way, taking you from one persons account to anothers in a very real way.  i never thought a zombie book would keep me occupied.  It's not written in a horror type of style, it's written in an odd, historical report kind of way that makes you actually believe what your are reading is real.  Kudos to Mr. Brooks for writting a great book.  The only thing that bothered me about the book, was the way it ended, it tied characters from the book together in it's oown unique way but have reading several hundred accounts of the zombie war, i was left trying to figure out who was who at the end.  Other than that, GREAT READ!
B000J4QWMC|3.0|I love Michael Mann.  Of his entire (and quite impressive) oeuvre, only one of his films I've found to be seriously flawed: The Keep.  Visually, there's no one better.  And since adopting digital HD as his new medium, the eye candy is made all the more striking.  As a writer, Mann's storylines are typically layered, intricate; the dialogue tight and intelligent.  No one can argue that Heat is one of the coolest, slickest, smartest, most rewarding and dense takes on the ol' cops and robbers formula ever.  Mann's latest film, Miami Vice is a return to that.  The results, however, are underwhelming. While the film looks terrific, the story lost me early on, and for a reason. To conceal the fact that there is no plot.  Thus making a slow movie seem much slower.  The acting, particularly from the leads, is stiff.  They scowl and that's about all.  Brooding aside, there isn't much of a human element here.  Sure, these guys are hard-boiled, street-saavy undercover cops, but there isn't much else for them (or the viewer) to sink their teeth into, to become emotionally invested in.  Miami Vice will surely draw endless comparisons to Heat, and on some levels Miami Vice is like Heat, far moreso than the Mann-created television series of the '80s it's based on, but without the attention to detail or the human element that made that film an instant classic.  It's too bad considering the talent involved.  Miami Vice is ultimately an unsatisfying time.  An extra star has been awarded to the film for the inclusion of not one, but two Mogwai songs on the soundtrack.
0385508840|1.0|Shouldn't this be re-classified into the fiction section? Suffice to say this kook spent years trying to sell screenplays to Hollywood. Don't pick up this rubbish.
1401384145|4.0|I really enjoyed this book -- his observations of what has occurred over the past few years about how the web has impacted modern economics is right-on.   <br /> <br />My only gripe is that I think the book could have been just as effective if it was cut-in-half.  Most of his Long Tail examples and points are beaten senselessly into the reader's head.  Regardless -- it's an easy read, and contains good information about how to approach business in a Web 2.0 world.
B000JVT1U0|4.0|(3.5/5 stars)  A callous fact of life is that sometimes bad things happen to good people, just as good things sometimes happen to bad people. Ultimately, if there is any benefit to holding a particular belief, I don't know what it is. That is also why I like this movie so much. I won't ruin the end for those who have not seen it, except to say the entire film is worth seeing. Edward Woodward is Sergeant Howie, a straight-shooting policeman if ever there was one. After receiving an anonymous letter indicating a twelve-year old girl is missing, he proceeds to search for her on Summerisle, a fictitious island supposedly situated off the coast of Scotland. There he finds the locals to be as obstructive as they are lusty, which is most offensive to his pious nature. Their fertility rites strike him as pagan sacrilege, even as he fails to reconcile this with his own beliefs about resurrection. He is intolerant of their beliefs; yet, he has a job to do, so he abides. Does this girl even exist and, if so, will he ever find her? Woodward is fantastic as Sgt. Howie, as is Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle. As the innkeeper's daughter, Swedish actress (and one-time wife of Peter Sellers), Britt Eckland is gorgeous, vivacious and seductive. My biggest problems with the film are the songs; even though they relate to the plot, they are too numerous and sometimes annoying. The film sometimes takes on the appearance of a musical, which would not be my preference for an ostensible horror film. A more juidicous use of music would have been more effective. Also, subtitles on this DVD would help because the dialogue is sometimes difficult to hear, especially Christopher Lee's. The Anchor Bay restoration of previously deleted footage is respectable, with its inclusion seamlessly interwoven. This new two-disc set is great because it includes the US theatrical version as well as the extended version.
B00005B3OT|5.0|Buying home theatre releases of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" has become something of an obsession with me over the years. I bought a tape of the restored version in 1992, then, 5 years later, I bought a \\"35 years anniversary\\" edition that in addition to the film itself featured a short documentary named \\"Wind, sand and star - the making of a classic\\". Needless to say, I also bought the long-awaited dvd release (in fact, I bought the 2-disc-release as well as a French 3-disc-release). I can full-heartedly recommend any of the dvd releases I know - both picture and sound are breathtakingly good and reveal details I never noticed in all the years that went by until the dvd release. Much, if not all, of the additional material is worth your while; although one cannot help noticing O'Toole's absence in all material of recent date. Nevertheless, superior quality of sound and picture make this dvd release of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" one of the best-loved discs in my personal collection.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Having been an Iron Maiden fan for many years, I was pleasantly surprised with the release of Iron Maiden's latest album, \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\". Having Adrian Smith's guitar work on an Iron Maiden album again is a nice treat that has been missing from some of the recent albums. As always, Bruce Dickinson's voice work can't be beat for his range of tone and emotion, especially on the tracks, \\"These colours don't run\\" and \\"The reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\" to name a few.The other guitar work from Steve Harris, Dave Murray, and Janick Gers is incredible. Adrian, Steve, Dave, and Janick compliment each other well. Nicko Mcbrain on the drums is as good as ever if not better. My favorite Iron Maiden album will always be \\"Somehere In Time\\" but this is going to be a close second.Like a fine wine, Iron Maiden has gotten better with the years. I really enjoyed this album and if your a Maiden fan I think you will too!! Up the Irons!!!!
0446528056|5.0|This Nicholas Sparks book takes a different course, then  his prior books. <br />The character development had lots of details and insights.  In the story line, things seem to happen for a reason and then the characters work through the challenges.
B00005JNX0|2.0|I didn't think much of \\"Madagascar\\". It sees a bunch of animals escape from Central Park Zoo, New York, only to be captured, deported, shipwrecked, and caught up in Lemur/Foosa politics on Madagascar and the instincts of the wild. It felt more like a TV special than a movie, and didn't really have much of an ending. I found the style of jokes kind of tired, just let me down a bit. Special features include some new footage of the penguins, among other things.
0767827902|5.0|In viewing The Last Picture Show, you will find yourself transformed to a place and time in america that few of us would ever know exsisted without Peter Bogdonavich's masterful presentation of Larry McMurtry(Brokeback Mountian) novel.  Released in 1971 in black and white it was one of the biggest hits of the year with 8 Acadamy Award nominations.  Everytime I watch this movie I think what it would be like filmed in color, and I can't imagine, too much would be lost.  The innocence and youthful characters are contrasted with the aged and harded characters of the town in a way that anyone who grew up in a small town can relate too.  The performances are all outstanding, especially Cloris Leachman, Timothy Bottoms and Ben Johnson.  Sit back and live with these people for a summer and you will walk away feeling a little sad, but that you have witnessed a piece of all of us.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|Keep your money in your wallett. This is a rip off. Amateur job of mixing multiple sound tracks together. Give me free run of the Beatle music vault and I guarantee I could produce something much better than this. I've listened to it twice, I don't think I will be able to listen to it again. And I've been an avid Beatles fan since 1963. Loved the peek behind the door we were given with Anthology. Wish we could have another Anthology, but not this piece of rubbish. The choices of combinations make you scratch your head in wonder. Surely any real Beatles fan could do better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone think \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" is better if you shorten it and add crowd noise to the background? So what if you can melt the intro of \\"Blackbird\\" into \\"Yesterday\\". What does that prove? Whoopie.  <br /> <br />Then you take \\"Help\\" and just play it straight. Fine, but why? \\"Sun King\\" backward? Give me a break. I would have much preferred to hear some of the original backward recording played forward to see if they really did say \\"Paul is dead now, miss him, miss him, miss him.\\" <br /> <br />I would return it and get my money back, but my wife gave it to me for Christmas. Gotta keep it. Major disappointment. I had read rave reviews and thought it might be at least an interesting compliation of Beatles music. I was wrong. Nothing of use here. Maybe next year's offering will be better.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I had only seen bits and pieces of Smallville before on tv and did not know what <br />I was missing! After I bought the first season I couldn't believe what I had <br />been missing! What a great show!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|A country, that produces movies, which are as scathingly sarcastic about its own culture, cannot be entirely lost to civilization. America does understand America after all. I have hope.<br /><br />This movie is as black a piece of humour as you can find. Possibly not even the title hero is quite right in her mind, but let us be generous. She is cute. The most so when she loses her mind over having qualified for the finals.<br /><br />The rest of the family has been accurately summarized as \\"dysfunctional\\". What a nice word. Whoever found it and popularized it deserves a special praise. It is even better, all by itself, than Greg Kinnear's wonderful lecture on refusing to lose. Only in America...<br /><br />It is so realistic, you could shed tears over it. It is so funny, you can hardly ever laugh, seriously.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|This record's so amazing that I have only listened to it once and I can tell it's a classic. Have no doubts.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This film was hysterical.  While I think most everyone relates to Olive at some point, the fully represented dynamic of the nutty family is probably equally familiar.  I loved everything about this film, except that it ended.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Brand new DVD.  Received in excellent condition.  This item was much cheaper then at most discount stores.  The beautiful thing about this DVD is that it is a Classic.  It was a flop when it was first filmed, but now it is as American as apple pie.
0375505091|4.0|I expected samples of her best photos. It really is documentary of Annie's life. As such it is of interest - I hope her next book will be examples of future work. She is a fabulous  photographer.
6305388458|4.0|Excellent!  Wonderful laugh at \\"what if\\" things had have been different.  Not for the narrow minded Bible punting folk (they could take offence).
B000GGSM76|5.0|Take one part renewed band confidence and camaraderie, one part incredibly strong songs, one part compelling visual  identity ( this was, after all, the mid-Eighties ), throw in the fact that they're English and just *slightly* mad and you've got the recipe for the undeniable, unstopable force of \\"the Head on the Door.\\" Helped no doubt by two of the best, most recognisable singles these lads have ever released, THOTD  finally broke the Cure as a viably popular band around the world. I think the main reason is that this is an all-Cure-for-all-people kind of album. Neither completely bleak nor completely \\"pop\\", it has elements of all the sounds the Cure had explored up to that point. A few angry, tense moments ( \\"Push\\", \\"Screw\\" ), melancholy navel-gazing (\\"Sinking\\"), a bit of mindless dance fun ( \\"Close to Me\\", \\"the Baby Screams\\" ) some world music  textures ( \\"the Blood\\" \\"Kyoto Song\\" ) and timeless pop ( \\"Inbetween Days\\", \\"A Night Like This\\", \\"Six Different Ways\\" ) all come together in this, a definite keeper in the Cure's catalogue. The remastered reissue is a real sonic improvement, the liner notes, commentary and photos are nice extras, and the demos and live performances on the bonus disc show the song development in a fascinating way. A Highlight of popular music, and Very Highly Recommended.
B00005U8EM|5.0|\\"Groundhog Day\\" is a classic if there ever was one. Featuring a 100 % perfect performance from the one and only Bill Murray, a strong, well written plot and loads of laugh, this is a true classic.<br /><br />Murray plays the acerbic, insulting, and overall rude weatherman Phil Connors. Along with his obsessively perky producer (Andie McDowell) and his smartass cameraman (Chris Elliot), he journeys to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover Groundhog Day. When a snowstorm hots, Phil is forced to spend the night. But when he wakes up the next morning, Phil realizes he is experiencing Groundhog Day once again, and again, again, and again...until he finally gets it right.<br /><br />This heartwarming movie is filled with laughs as well as a great message. This special edition comes with a documentary, adduio commentary by director Harold Ramis, and great remastered sound and picture quality.
B000HIVQK8|5.0|i had the \\"Living In The Material World\\" CD when it came out and when i saw the Remastered CD come out i thought, oh well, 2 Bonus tracks, o.k. so i bought it again and only later discovered that there was a cd with dvd available that i'd seen somehwere in an ad or something, that was a must for me then. i was of course by now more interested in the bonus dvd which shows scenes in the park, bringing the photographs to life that we've known from the inlay section of the original LP record, or vinyl as they call'em nowadays. what i also found interesting was the pressing plant, the scenes at the pressing plant where they show how the record was tested for quality, where it was packed, the woman sitting there and packing the inserts between each folding cover, and i thought, maybe that very same woman had my record in her hands, the record i bought in the early 70s when it had just come out and i remember listening to it all over christmas and i listened to it again this last christmas and watched the dvd. it's a lovely recording to cherish and to remember. what i didn't know was that George Harrison used the original backing track to \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" that Ronnie Spector had used on her song, that is another fact stated in the documentary section of the DVD. <br /> <br />i still love the album and it's still fresh to me and brings back fond memories ... that's why we preserve things on discs and tapes, isn't it? <br /> <br />JohPWilbrand
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|this is one of a few concerts i'd be waiting for to be released on the currently popular DVD format. considering that the movie was filmed on 16mm film and blown up frame by frame to 70mm as Saul Swimmer explains in the documentary among the bonus material, the DVD is of excellent picture quality. not to forget the sound quality, even though i guess there is nothing like the original 70mm magnetic 6-channel movie soundtrack :-}, well, that's at least how it was in those days with 70mm movies. i asked a colleague of mine who HAD been projecting 70mm movies in his life as a projectionist if he'd ever shown this movie, but he was not aware of it having been shown at the local cinema at the time. <br /> <br />the first copy of the concert i had was -- what i now see as a bootleg video tape from a film -- on VHS that a friend of mine gave to me in the 80s. it's a pity that one Bob Dylan song from the concert which is on the record, never made it onto the disc, only as a bonus track can Bob Dylan be seen performing \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\", from the 1st concert. probably because, as again Saul Swimmer explained, all cameras started to roll at the same time, thus ran out of film the same time, it is very possible that this one song was never caught on film in the first place. <br /> <br />This concert was the First Benefit Concert which started a row of Benefit Concerts (Live Aid, Farm Aid), and Kofi Anan, now retired UN General Secretary speaks about it as well in the documentary section. <br /> <br />Overall, i love the atmosphere that comes from the stage, even if it's only from a DVdisc, all the artists were still so young, George Harrison just 28, Eric Clapton 26 ... i mean, what did you do at THAT age? <br /> <br />JohPWilbrand
B000J103PC|5.0|Just like \\"Breakfast at Tiffanys\\" launched Audrey Hepburn and the little black dress as fashion icons, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" inspired women all over to start paying closer attention to their wardrobes. <br /> <br />I know it sounds petty but several of my friends told me that they started re-thinking their wardrobe immediately after leaving the theater.  I have yet to meet a 20, 30, or 40-something who did not enjoy this film either because of Meryl Streep, the cast in general, the storyline, the fashions, or a bit of each. <br /> <br />Anne Hathaway's Andy Sachs starts off as a fashion victim who is mocked by her co-workers for her fashion sense. After landing a dream job for a famous fashion magazine, she has a fabulous make-over but also sacrifices almost everything else to work for the imperious Miranda Priestly (the devilishly delightful Meryl Streep).  The film is filled with fabulous scene-stealers like Andy's co-workers Emily (Emily Blunt) and Nigel (Stanley Tucci) and some interesting eye candy like Simon Baker and Adrian Grenier.  And, honestly, with my favorite cities New York and Paris co-starring in the film...what is there not to like? <br /> <br />I adore \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" It is funny, and a pure delight....and with the added bonus of inspiring me to be a better dresser. Ha!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|every now and then on a quite night i pull out this 2 disc DVD set again and enjoy watching the beginnings of a young musical poet and can't help comparing to where he is now and the friends he left on the road. some of the interviewees have passed away before or after the release of the film/dvd. Dave van Ronk never had a chance to see it and his book \\"The Governor of MacDougal\\" was posthumously released. Harald Leventhal died just days after i bought the DVDs. Maria Muldaur, meanwhile, has released Bob Dylan's \\"Moonlight\\" on her album \\"Love Wants To Dance\\" and on her album \\"Heart of Mine\\" which she produced and belongs to the Dylan Cover Songs category. <br /> <br />Interesting is also the list of record sleeves shown in the film about how often the song \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\" had already been covered in the early 60s, a song of which i in my youth always thought was a traditional song. <br /> <br />every movie for me has favorite and not so favorite scenes, but my most favorite scene in this film is where Maria Muldaur explains after the \\"Newport Folk Festival\\" event that she saw him sitting there alone in the corner and she went up to him asking if he'd like to dance and Bob Dylan replied \\"I'd love to dance with you, Maria, but my hands are of fire.\\" i guess that's THE statement in the movie ... well, at least for me. <br /> <br />JohPWilbrand

0875428940|5.0|I took a class at a local high school several years ago to learn to read tarot. The instructor suggested Rider Waite but I did not find them to be at all attractive or inspiring. So when I saw a friend using Robin Wood I immediately purchased them, since they are in the Rider Waite tradition, but are visually way more appealing. <br /> <br />The Robin Wood deck is very easy to learn with. Pick a card and guess what it means and you are probably right; the imagery is so easy to read that studying them is a joy. The line drawings are well crafted and detailed with watercolor and colored pencils. Their simplicity contributes to the ease of reading them. <br /> <br />The deck is a Pagan one, but unless you are Pagan or have studied Paganism, the references will most likely be lost on you. The references are not distracting, and certainly do not call attention to themselves. <br /> <br />It's nice to find a deck which forgoes the Roman numerals; these again, are much easier to read. And the banners on the Major Arcana help those stand out. The pips are fully illustrated, rich with imagery which makes it easier to identify with them as well. <br /> <br />The cards have a matte finish on them, so fingerprints are not an issue. They are a good thickness, and wear well. They are also easy to shuffle. <br /> <br />I can't speak to the little booklet that comes with the deck; it is long gone. But for an in-depth look at why Robin Wood used specific imagery and colors, check out her book \\"Robin Wood Tarot: The Book\\". It will not teach you to read tarot, but can help to remember each card and its' meaning. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this deck for beginners, and for anyone who likes to own beautiful tarot cards.

B00005NGZX|5.0|Can brutality be beautiful? Converge doesn't stammer to answer this question. Their response is an insanely fast and intense as hell conglomeration of metal, poetry, spirituality, and splendor. If music could somehow be an infusion of words, notes, and volatility, the end result for this band would seemingly be an incineration of sound. Converge has been together since late 1990 and within months of that, recorded their first demos. Ever since then, they've been putting out unyielding albums and don't show any signs of letting up. Sometimes dark, elegiac, cryptic, and despair-ridden, Converge writes some of the most eloquent tunes in music today. No stranger to addressing contemporary issues as well, they are one of the most underrated bands to grace this industry. Recommended Songs: \\"Minnesota,\\" \\"My Unsaid Everything,\\" \\"Albatross,\\" \\"Heaven In Her Arms,\\" and \\"Concubine.\\"

0307341542|3.0|My main criteria for rating is interest, and this first novel of Gillian Flynn kept my interest throughout. A little slow with the buildup, but an original dark mystery the ending of which is not at all obvious as others may have you believe. Very good character development. Not quite 4 stars as I feel the last chapter was a trifle hurried, but a strong 3 1/2.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|This is a good \\"guy movie\\". Some have made an issue out of the fact that all the stars are young no-name models. What difference does that make if they can all act? One top named actor said he would  never act with one of these rappers-turned-actors because they haven't \\"paid their dues\\". Again, if they can act, does it matter if L.L. Cool J did not go to Juliard? This movie was  probably meant to appeal to young women 16-25, but isn't it every guys' fantasy to have these kind of powers and beat each other sensless? I know I used to dream of having these kinds of powers and dealing with school bullies and \\"in crowders\\" when I was in school. The movie was very good. If , I would change anything though or add it to the sequel, I would have had Chase put Caleb's other two warlock friends in danger or even beat them senselss. It may have even added to the film if one of the four were killed by Chase. <br /> <br />The physcial fights between Caleb and Chase were very well done, although his \\"ascension\\" did not help him as much as expected. There was a big build up to Caleb's ascension, but when it happened, he just continued to get beaten and overpowered by Caleb. If Caleb had killed the Warlock on the motorcycle and made him will him his power before dying, at the threat of killing his cursed grilfriend, this would have added to the climactic battle and would've explained Chase's equalling Caleb's \\"ascension\\" powers.  Calebs ascension powers should have been what made him equal and surpass Chase's powers, not Caleb's father's sacrifice. Chase should have killed Caleb's father after he refused to will him his powers.  <br /> <br />All of the posing when Caleb and Chase were fighting was very good and comic bookish. This movie could have been better, but all in all, it was very good.
B00005JPAM|4.0|It's reassuring to see an actress of Helen Mirren's caliber finally receiving the top-line recognition she deserves for a role that must have been challenging to tackle without sinking into parody as others before her have. As Queen Elizabeth II, she manages to convey the immaculate decorum of her real-life counterpart without sacrificing the humanism essential in empathizing with her during a trying time. The period in question is the week that felt like an eternity after the death of Princess Diana in 1997 when the world was awaiting an official response from the Queen. With just a wig and glasses to alter her appearance, Mirren is superb in a role that must have been quite constraining given that the subject is not only still the reigning monarch but the model of blank-faced self-possession. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears in a surprisingly dishy manner, the film actually plays out as a witty comedy of manners beset by a tragic event.<br /><br />The 2006 film chronicles that momentous week and prefaces it with Tony Blair's first formal introduction to the Queen in May 1997 after his election as the first Labour Party Prime Minister in nearly two decades. Elizabeth's concerns over Blair's promises of modernity are expressed in small gestures, but obviously their values-based clash come to the fore when Diana is killed in a Paris car accident six months later. Cloistered at the time in their Scottish estate, Balmoral, the royal family does not support a public memorial for Diana since she had divorced Charles the previous year. However, public outcry over their seeming aloofness reaches a level of frenzy that places Blair in the difficult spot of requesting the Queen to speak to her subjects about what she considers a private matter. Exacerbating the situation is the residual animosity that the royal family feels toward Diana, whom they feel had betrayed them in the media.<br /><br />While the story is fact-based, one can't help but believe the private moments are played with a certain amount of exaggerated tabloid-friendly bias, especially the frequently cutting swipes at Diana and the rather fanciful episode with the stag. It makes for some of the film's more entertaining moments, but concurrently they undermine the credibility of the account. Beyond Mirren, there is superbly comic work from James Cromwell as a blustery, unsympathetic Prince Philip; Alex Jennings as a grieving but oddly vacant and paranoid Prince Charles; Helen McCrory as Blair's curtsey-challenged, tough-minded wife Cherie; and Sylvia Syms (not the jazz singer) as the still-alert, eye-rolling Queen Mother. Initially, Michael Sheen looks like he will do a zealous parody of the real Blair, but he gains respectable gravity as the story progresses. Above all else, the film is a personal triumph for Mirren's stellar work in what may turn out to be the role of a lifetime.ve the private moments are played with a certain amount of exaggerated tabloid-friendly bias, especially the frequently cutting swipes at Diana and the rather fanciful episode with the stag.

B000ICM5IK|3.0|This isn't so much a soundtrack to Rocky Balboa as it is a survey of all the soundtracks in the Rocky franchise.  A lot of great stuff is included, like Bill Conti's memorable piano bits and anthemic fanfare, and pop-rock hits \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" and \\"Burning Heart\\" by Survivor.  But some key music is omitted, like Vince deCola's stirring synth work for \\"Training Montage\\" and \\"War\\" from Rocky IV.  Instead, other less stellar tracks are featured, like rap / hip-hop junk like \\"Can't Stop the Fire\\" from Rocky V and \\"It's a Fight\\" from the new film ( a gangsta-rap style track complete with profanity and devoid of originality).  Like others above, I'd like to have seen a more complete collection, possibly two discs, which perhaps collects all the great Conti stuff from I, II, II and \\"Balboa\\" on one disc, with all the pop-rock stuff on a second.  Til then, just take this one and mix it up with \\"Training Montage\\" and \\"War\\" from IV, plus \\"Vigil\\" and \\"Nana Ninni / Two Kinds of Love\\" from II and you'll be okay.   Oh, and you'll have to download \\"Take you Back\\" from iTunes, cuz it ain't on here.
B000J4QWMC|2.0|I rented Miami Vice with pretty low expectations based on the reviews and my expectations were met. I have several criticisms. First, the film was badly miscast. Colin Farrell was all wrong as Crockett. His expression varied between sulk and pout throughout the movie. His accent was all wrong as well. He had the same vaguely Irish accent he had in Alexander, and you definitely don't want to be reminded of Alexander ever when watching another movie. On the plus side he did have a great permanent three-day growth of beard, like Don Johnson. Jamie Foxx was OK as Tubbs but the two together had no chemistry whatsoever. They could have been two randomly assigned partners, not two men in an intense buddy relationship.  <br /> <br />And why in the world was Li Gong cast as the main female lead? As best as I could tell she was supposed to be playing a Cuban woman yet she clearly could not speak Spanish (and maybe English as well). What gives? Why not cast an Hispanic actress in the part? Throughout the film I kept thinking \\"But she's Chinese! She's not Cuban.\\" Very distracting and it made no sense. Plus, she and Farrell had zero chemistry together. <br /> <br />But my biggest complaint is the casting of Barry Shabaka Henley as Castillo, my favorite character from the TV show. Totally wrong. Henley is amusing in the Aflac commercials but looks completely wrong as Castillo. The role calls for an intense actor filled with barely controlled rage, not some paunchy guy who looks like he belongs behind a desk. The scene where he's trying to locate snipers made me giggle. I kept seeing him in the floppy eared hat he wears in the Christmas Aflac commercial. Why not just cast Edward James Olmos? He still looks great and would have been perfect in the role he created. Maybe promote him to captain to explain his being older.  <br /> <br />The story itself was pretty pedestrian, the part I could follow anyway. The first 10 minutes made little sense since I couldn't understand half the dialogue. Finally I turned on the subtitles just so I could follow the plot. Everyone was intentionally overacting and the number of cliches (white supremacists, Colombian drug lords, crooked cops, the girlfriend in danger, etc) were too numerous to count. I was waiting for the Russian mafia to show up just to complete the cliche list. Maybe they'll be in the sequel. <br /> <br />On the plus side, the boats, airplanes, cars and clothes looked great.

B00005JPDL|4.0|Nancy Meyers' \\"The Holiday\\" has been seriously dissed by most of America's film critics--including one who suggested that any man who goes to see it should be forced to pay with a crucial part of his anatomy instead of money. \\"The Holiday\\" is indeed a prime example of what is condecendingly known as a \\"chick flick,\\" and it's not a movie you can make great claims for. But \\"The Holiday\\" succeeds outstandingly in living up to its title; it provides an audience with a two-hour vacation filled with charming, likable actors playing charming, likable characters. The movie is set during the Christmas holidays in which two women with man problems--Iris (Kate Winslet), an English journalist, and Amanda (Cameron Diaz), an L.A. producer of film trailers--meet over the Internet. On a whim, they decide to switch houses for Christmas; Amanda ends up in Iris's picture-postcard-pretty cottage in Surrey, Iris in Amanda's luxurious, gated mansion in Beverly Hills. There, they discover new romantic complications: Amanda with Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and Iris with a film composer named Miles (Jack Black). There's also a subplot about the friendship that develops between Iris and an elderly screenwriter played by the venerable Eli Wallach. Nothing that happens in the movie is at all original or consequential. I could even quibble about an inaccuracy or two in Meyers' screenplay (Cary Grant was from Bristol in Gloucestershire, not Surrey). But seeing \\"The Holiday\\" makes you feel happy and light of heart, which is all it sets out to do. While the film's appeal is necessarily greater for women, I also think most men will find this a more-than-serviceable date movie. Sometimes you want a movie that's rich, gooey and sweet, that contains no sharp edges and requires no sharp utensils for its consumption. In an increasingly abrasive world, the need for cinematic confections is greater than ever, and \\"The Holiday\\" fills that bill.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This should have gotten the Oscar.  It is head-and-shoulders above _Happy Feet_ in all respects: The animation is better, the storyline is vastly better, and it's much less crude.  However, unlike _Happy Feet_, it's not a movie that does all the entertaining for you with cheap laughs; you have to pay attention.    I must confess that I thought the story line needed a bit of editing (was not as well-paced as the Toy Story movies), but it wasn't glaring.  The other downside is that this is not really a kids' movie.  The action is much too fast and the bulk of the humor is in cultural references and comparatively sophisticated sight gags, most of which will go right over the heads of children (and, I guess, of some adults, hence the criticism that it is \\"tedious\\").  It's an extraordinarily clever movie and can be watched several times before one catches all the little gags.    On the up side:  1) It lacks most of the toilet humor and thinly-disguised sexual references to which Disney seems to be resorting more and more.    2) The animation is mind-boggling.  Some of the scenery doesn't even look like animation, and the nuances of automotive movement (shaking smokestacks, etc.) are dead-on.  Makes _Happy Feet_ look mediocre and _Toy Story_ look like stick figures.  Absolutely a visually gorgeous movie.  3) The story line, while a bit uneven, is still better than the vast majority of animated features.  4) For those old enough to \\"get\\" them, the celebrity cameos, identifiable cars, historical references, and Americana references are priceless.  Click and Clack from NPR's \\"Car Talk\\" are not to be missed as the Rust-Eze guys.
0060589280|4.0|At one point, the detailed S&M encounter reminiscent of something you might read in a trashy, romance novel, I was about to toss this book in the bin. But, I perservered and was glad that I did because it changed course on a dime afterward, instead of descending deeper. However, in all honesty this book creeped me out... a sort of creepy, dark version of The Alchemist, a book I loved so much that I bought several copies just to pass out to my friends. Part of the problem, aside from the S&M and prostitution, is that the main character, Maria, speaks with the way too intellectual and spiritually wise voice of an elderly, Brazilian man... perhaps Paulo Coelho?! Both her inner dialogue and her diary entries were far too wise and spiritual to feel authentic coming from a 20-something-Brazilian-bumpkin-turned-prostitute and she just came across as a vehicle for Mr. Coelho to share his thoughts, and perhaps to hide behind. Maybe it's time for Mr. Coelho to write something from the point of view of an aging hippy, spiritualist author instead of a main character so unlike himself, but who somewhat incongruously, speaks with his voice.  Also, I have to say I laughed at the \\"five orgasms\\" part... only a man would write something like that! This book really only felt like about 3 stars to me, but I'm giving it 4 because of the good intentions of the message that Paulo Coelho is trying to share with his readers.
6305428042|5.0|Don't let \\"All Hallows Eve\\" go by without seeing this holiday classic. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy do an excellent job as the three Sanderson sisters brought back to life after 300 years. This film is fun to watch and suitable for the entire family. And Bette even gets a song in.
B00005JPDS|4.0|The average critical reaction to this movie seems to be that it's \\"Hollywood Fluff\\" full of \\"self-help platitudes\\" and \\"unrealistic, emotionally manipulative treacle\\".        The funny thing is, this movie is based quite closely on a true story, and anyone that wants to let out the routine criticisms should check out the real story.        This movie wasn't fluffed up to make the character's plight worse than it was- if anything, it was toned down. In the movie, Gardner's wife is portrayed as a fundamentally good, hardworking woman who leaves because she just can't put up with him anymore, and Gardner has to fight tooth and nail for his son.       In real life, she just ran off with their son -only to show up at his homeless shelter months later to tell him that she couldn't deal with him, and he was just going to have to take care of him himself. Not the type of woman audiences would be sorry to see go.       Also left out are the details of his childhood, the physical abuse Garder took from his stepfather as a child, and the time he was raped by an older man.         To me, this movie isn't about an ordinary man getting rich, with the message \\"anyone can do this\\". To me, this is the story of an extraordinary man. I don't like it because the Will Smith's character could be anybody or an \\"everyman\\", but because his determination is something to look up to and aspire to.       I saw a pre-fame video from 2000 of the real Chris Gardner, and while he's a lot balder, chubbier and grouchier than the Will Smith version, he was clearly a very bright and interesting guy. Without nearly as many Hollywood flourishments as so many assume, this is his story, and it deserves some repect.       This is a good, solid movie. It's Will Smith best performance to date. It reminds me of Tom Cruise in \\"Jerry Maguire\\" (in his pre-couch days!), and  the chemistry with his son is nice. If you want a feel-good movie with a story worth thinking about, this movie is recommended.
B00028HBKC|1.0|My review is for Amazon, not the movie content. <br />I bought 6 of these Movies for 17.99 each through Amazon in 2004 (New..supposedly not used or foreign) for Christmas gifts and just now got around to trying to watch mine, come to find out it is not in English and I cannot change the language selection to English. Worst part of this is, that I gave them out as Christmas gifts! <br />Guess everyone was too polite to say anything. <br />How embarrassing. <br />I am not sure I should order any movies though Amazon unless I intend to watch them myself and be able to return it within the specified 30 days. <br />Beware.
B00004SCX6|5.0|(review edited 8/07)    1 STAR for this release    Young, developing minds need to listen and hear MUSIC created by MUSICIANS. Musicians are artistic souls, like poets or painters. What we are seeing in pop music today are PRODUCTS, and products only, and these product producers have their fingers in all the flavors of pie: rock, metal, rap, teen-pop, girl bands, boy bands, or whatever.    Britney Spears is a product peddlar, not a highly talented musician/artist.     If you get goose bumps, that is, if all the hair on your arms stands up when you hear some music, then you know it has touched the core of your being in a true-to-you and powerful way.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Terrific film. Read the other reviews to get the story, they tell it all very well. The magic tricks alone are so gloriously beautiful that they are worth the film.  Your kids can watch it; they will ooooh and aaah and grin in wonder.(no nudity, sex, or bad language. ) The magic is absolutely beautiful and wonderful and wondrous.  This is a very fine film done very well, and if your kids don't understand all the twists and turns of it it doesn't matter. You will, and will just open your mouth in awe at the end. It is a love story and a tale of great wonder and magic. I can guarantee that you will love this film. It is your childhood with all of its pains and hopes and magics incorporated into a film. And, I can't tell you the ending. You have to watch it for yourself. Kudoes to this one!
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby said he intended to write this as if two friends were out shooting photos and you asked how to do something, and you'd get a simple straight forward answer.  Well, that is exactly what he accomplished.  This is a very useful and helpful book.  Well thought out and organized.  There's one tip per page along with a photo example.  It's all right there, no flipping back and forth between pages to see what Mr. Kelby is talking about.  And of course there's Scott's unique brand of humor to keep the book lighthearted and moving along.  I've recommended this book to several friends and they've all enjoyed it and found it useful.
B00005JPDJ|5.0|when casting actors who are so well known in other films it can sometimes be difficult for the viewer to detach them for their other work however this is not the case for jude law, jack black, cameron diaz and kate winslet. their performances were so convincing that i was riveted from start to finsh. not being able to hide behind an american accent must have been a daunting prospect for law and winslet but they pulled it off with ease. i was curious to see jack black in a \\"serious\\" role but the connection with music in the film and his jolly antics never let me forget who he really was. the part of amanda was so perfect for diaz - as a wealthy bussiness woman but yet couldn't boil an egg.  <br />the jokes were hilarious and perfectly timed, a film that could make you cry with laughter and with sorrow. the holiday is definately my favourite film of 2006

B000IHY9SE|4.0|Eminem is an enigma to the hip-hop world. Back in the day, when he was nothing more than an underground Detroit emcee pushing EP's to make a living, he was spitting lyrics on par with some of the game's most respected lyricists; I'm talking Nas, and Wu-Tang knowledge here. Infinite and The Slim Shady EP contained hardcore lyrics by a young emcee, who'd studied his craft extensively; his vocabulary was superb, and his flow was one of the most polished, yet energetic anyone had heard at the time. He was poised for success, and success came to him, with the help of Dr. Dre. I have no problem admitting that The Slim Shady LP and Marshall Mathers LP were two of the best mainstream hip-hop releases of any era, and the level of lyrical dexterity Eminem displayed on those releases is often overlooked by poor, and flawed criticism. The Eminem Show was also pretty tight, but it showed that Eminem had begin to faulter; his subject matter had become redundant, and concepts like Hailie's Song failed miserabley. It was still more than solid, as a whole, but it showed that Em may've taken a step backwards. I think Encore more than solidified this belief; I don't care who would've released Encore, because whether it was Eminem, Nelly, or Kool G. Rap, that album would've come across as a steaming pile of ish. <br /> <br />It was horrible to watch Eminem's lyrical self-destruction; as much personal self-destruction as he put on wax, he had always remained a razor-sharp emcee, with superior wit compared to his contemporaries. People forget that while he's always been a media darling, the only reason he truly blew up in hip-hop wasn't marketing; it was skills. While many people say Eminem's overrated, and by his hardcore fans, he may very well be, he's actually underrated by the core of hip-hop heads. He has spit, admittedly and unfortunately, some garbage within the last few years, but that doesn't detract from the legacy he's created since the Infinite EP dropped. On The Re-Up, Eminem seems to have made a return to form; however, when i say Eminem's returned to form, I don't neccessarily mean he's back to his Slim Shady ways. Slim Shady is virtually dead; that persona has a very unlikely chance of ever resurfacing, because Eminem's grown far too much to ever return to the playful, yet malevolent demeanor that Shady had. Now, he's a disgruntled emcee who's just looking to solidify his spot as one of the best in the game; and honestly, for Eminem at this point, that's an entirely appropriate stance for him to take. <br /> <br />Throughout The Re-Up, on the track Eminem features, he brings his a-game, at least on the rhyme-side of things. Em's production is still a bit bland, and this album would've benefitted had there been less of Em's fingertips on it behind the boards. Nonetheless, while the production isn't phenomenal, it is more than solid; the Shady roster carry the bulk of this release, and do quite well. Now, honestly, the members of Shady Records aren't exceptional artists; Cashis has some great potential, but that's virtually it for now. Bobby Creekwater sounds eerily like T.I., if Tip were still an amateur. Creekwater is an average emcee, but unless he was holding something back on this release, I don't see a very bright future ahead of him. I've never really been a fan of Stat Quo, and while he does get two bangers on this release from Focus and Dre, he still doesn't step things up lyrically. The surviving members of D12(sans Eminem) all appear on this album, and none of them have stepped their games up; Proof was clearly the only one who was above-average in the group, and it shows on his posthumous cut, \\"Trapped.\\" 50 Cent, having been out of the mainstream for a while now, seems rather hungry, and it shows on his rare appearances throughout this album. He doesn't steal the show, but he does provide some promise for his upcoming release, and possibly dropping something better than The Massacre was. Obie Trice is still the best emceeEminem has signed, but sadly, just like on his last solo, he's also gotten some pretty poor production to showcase his skills with. If Obie had gotten some Alchemist, or Dre cuts on this release, it would've pushed it even further in terms of quality. <br /> <br />This is by no means a bad release; it's actually very good, and surprisingly so. For a mixtape, and yes, this is still a mixtape, it's a rare one that provides more quality than quantity; and with 22 tracks, there's a lot of quantity. It could've been cut down, for sure; rehash like the Smack That and Shake That(gets confusing, I know) remixes could've been done without, and really shouldn't have made it onto this release once it received national distribution. The Re-Up is a great compilation, and it shows that Eminem maybe back to form, but only time can truly determine that; for now, don't dwell on Eminem's stance in the game though, and pick up The Re-Up. More than solid, but not outstanding, it's a good release that should hold Shady fans over.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Proof positive that director Christopher Nolan, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are among the finest, richest talents in Hollywood, \\"The Prestige\\" is a wickedly clever and riveting tale of all consuming obsession.  Don't be fooled by the magic angle.  This is a classic tale that simply uses rival magicians and the tricks of their trade to illustrate what all-too driven individuals are willing to unleash on one another in the name of one-upsmanship and superiority.  Bale and Jackman are terrific as the pair of rival magic men who try to destroy each other, their destructive animosity etched on their faces.   And its a showcase for the considerable talents of Christopher Nolan, who (along with his screenwriter kin Johnathon Nolan) executes one the most impressively acrobatic balancing acts in cinematic storytelling with the ease of a born illusionist.  Set in turn of the century England, magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman) toil to ascend to the upper echelons of the London entertainment circuit, under the tutelage of Cutter (the always superb Michael Caine), an experienced magician's aide.  Borden's and Angier's relationship turns poisionous after a tragic accident during a routine show, and both attempt to sabotage to other's attempt to rebuild their stiymied careers until Borden unveils a mind-boggling trick called the \\"Transported Man,\\" and Angier is driven nearly insane trying to discover Borden's methods that may (or may not) involve revolutionary new electrical technology developed by Nikola Tesla (a suprisingly restrained and haunting David Bowie).  The Nolan brothers take this story and send through the gauntlet, using flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks keep their audience just a little off guard and totally unprepared for the final twists that come furiously flying in the film's film's minutes while never losing sight of the slowly deteriorating psyches of their characters.  In other words, they tell their story just as any good magician would perform his trick.  But stick with them.  The film, although sometimes a grueling task to follow, steadily coalesces and amply rewards the careful observer.  Besides, Wally Pfister's cinematography, which finds the right balance of elegance and grittiness, and Lee Smith's rhythmic editing practically draw the audience in.  If \\"The Prestige\\" somehow passed you by in theaters, do not let it slip by now.  Watch closely at the on the best films waiting to be discovered.

B0001CCXZW|4.0|Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter namesake \\"Rory\\" Gilmore try to survive in a small town filled with quirky characters while retaining their individuality, and at times immaturity. After the first few episodes of Gilmore girls I found myself hooked, despise my frustration at times with the adult Lorelai (who I feel acts immature a lot). The premise is a cute one and there are plenty of fun times had by all, especially the introduction of Rory's boyfriend Dean, and Lorelai's romantic life.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I like this show, I am a bit tired of some elements. Lorelai and her daughter have awful eating habits. They seem to survive off of pizza, burgers, and poptarts and don't gain a pound. Seldom (except when they go to their grandparents do these two ladies eat a normal meal). Second, I do get a bit tired of the adult Lorelai's spastic jokes. The humor seems forced and dumb rather than witty and humorous as the writer's intended. Also, sometimes the small town atmosphere is TOO quirky, and too strange. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />I do like Rory's friend Ling, the character of Rory, her boyfriend Dean, and her friends Tristan and Paris. I like Luke occasionally and Suki in small doses.<br /><br />This is a good entertaining show with a few flaws. Well worth watching.
B000JVSUS4|3.0|The review for Pearl Harbor DVD release was done many moons ago.   <br /> <br />I am reviewing the HD quality of the movie.  The picture quality was dark and grainy on most of the scenes.  The movie was not shot in HD.  This was simply a film to HD conversion.  Most of the older movies did not have HD filming back then.  \\"The Cave\\" was partially shot in HD to show some of the beauty of the actual cave.  The sound was low during the vocal scenes.  I had to turn the volume down during the fight scenes.  It was shaking the whole house. <br /> <br />The movie comes to life in all the fight scenes.  The special effects bombing of Pearl Harbor was absolutely stunning.  The sound and picture quality was absolutely breath-taking.  They really worked on putting the 1080P to the test during these scenes.  This made up for the rest of the dingy quality of the movie.   <br /> <br />If you watch a lot of HD movies or HD TV shows, you should know what I'm taking about.  If you want to see some really crystal clear HD quality, then you should buy or rent Mission Impossible 3 on Blu-ray.  Every single light in the city sparkles with super clarity.  IMAX films have some impressive quality.  Most of the new releases like \\"Click\\" are very clear.  Terminator 2 was nice, but they already had a compressed HD version on the T2 Extreme DVD version for the PC. <br /> <br />Watch the History Channel extra included on the disc!  <br /> <br />Note: Quality does not change from Blu-ray, HD-DVD or Terrestrial Stream .TS <br />HD=HD  More space does not = better quality (until they actually start using most of the space for better quality) <br /> <br />

These practices, heavy in self-responsibility, cover the familiar ground of perception vs. realty, positive thinking, believing the best in people, and working together - but they do so against the background of his experience in the symphony and are presented in a series of examples that are both fun and enlightening.  <br /> <br />The Practices: <br />* It's all Invented - Through our preconceptions, so make it a positive one.  <br />* Giving an \\"A\\" - It's all invented, including the \\"A\\", so let's create a wonderful target reality to bring us closer to where we want to be.  <br />* Being a Contribution - You wake up each day in the frame of mind that you are a gift to others. You will make a difference and the reward is deeper and more lasting then money, fame, and power.  <br />* Leading From Any Chair - Make everyone lively and engaged; ask yourself how much greatness you are willing to grant to people.  <br />* Don't Take Yourself so Goddamn Seriously <br />* The Way Things Are - Recognize what is, not what should be weighting you down and determine where to go from here. Distinguish between assumptions, feelings, and facts.  <br />* Giving Way to Passion - Notice where you are holding back and let go. Participate fully, be channel to shape the stream of passion.  <br />* Lighting the Spark - Enroll others, generate their spark of possibility (don't force, cajole, trick, bargain, pressure or guilt others) <br />* Being the Board - You rename yourself as the board upon which you play. In general life there is the assumption that things will be under control so when things go wrong we look to place blame. But in the new world everything is not in control with different people having different values and thinking different things. So you need to name yourself as the board and decide the rules by which you will play.  <br />* Create a Framework of Possibility - A vision creates a framework for possibility when it meets certain criteria that distinguish it from the objectives of a downward spiral.  <br />* Tell the \\"We\\" Story - The story of unseen threads that connect us all
B00005JOQS|2.0|I have to write this review quickly, because in just a few days I won't remember anything about this forgettable movie.    SR opens with our hero returning from a five year hiatus in outer space to find that Lois is a mommy.  That's what this movie is all about, everything else is incidental.    Clark Kent is strangely uneasy around the little guy.  Lois tells him that the frail child is the product of her uncommitted relationship with a Daily Planet executive editor.  I'll bet you can already figure out the REAL truth, huh?  It would seem that Superman IS dedicated to the American way.  Just jump in the sack with whoever turns you on and make babies.    Anyway, Lex Luthor is played by Kevin Spacey just like a comic villian from the old Batman TV series, surrounded by ditzy women and hapless lackeys.  I guess even Kevin needs easy money now and then.    The computer graphics folks were very busy on this project.  Even Superman himself looks like a rendering in most scenes.  He is played with waxen unemotion by Brandon Routh, fitting his appearance perfectly.    I'll give this uninspired effort 2 yawns.

B000065BPB|5.0|There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said accurately by the numerous other people who have reviewed these headphones.  I use them with a headphone amplifier from HeadRoom, and they sound very good for the price.  (The amplifier isn't absolutely necessary as these are efficient enough at 64 ohms impedence that you can get fair output from most portable devices or headphone jacks on consumer audio equipment.  But the HeadRoom amplifier does really open these up.)  The attenuation of ambient noise is good, and they are comfortable.    However, the headband is not well designed.  Like others, I have noticed cracks developing in the plastic headband.  That's just poor design on Sennheiser's part.    Overall, this is a very good sealed headphone set under $100, but consider them semi-disposable because of the headband.

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Let me be blunt: this is not considered an \\"intellectual\\" film. Nonetheless, this is one of the most riveting films I have seen in ages. As you know, this film has been banned in multiple countries and is not well-appreciated in its own. It breaks some pretty serious taboos . . . namely, young fresh-faced children hacking each other to bits:) Of course, the idea that the government has locked exploding collars around their tender necks is a horrific bonus!!    Takeshi Kitano is FANTASTIC as the school teacher with an innocent yet disturbing crush on one of his pupils and an obsession with her baked goods (Ohhh, and wait until you see his painting!!)  Likewise, the characters of Shuya and Noriko are spectacular in their roles. They bring likability to what should be an \\"unlikeable\\" film. Nonetheless, Kazuo Kiriyama and Mitsuko Souma easily steal the show! Kazuo volunteers to be in this massacre (apparently for the thrill)!! He has the looks of Johnny Depp matched with the endurance of Jason Vorhees (forgive the comparison!!) Meanwhile, Mitsuko presents us with the most complex character in the film: as a victim of (potential) sexual abuse and an uncaring mother, Mitsuko has learned not to trust anyone. Moreover, she has learned to use her sexuality to get through life (it's interesting to see how this aspect figures into combat).    What may surprise you is how FUNNY (intentionally) this film is!!! The training video alone will have you in stitches (The adorable host makes exploding heads sound like a Saturday morning cartoon \\"BOOM!\\")!! TRUST ME - FUNNY STUFF!!!    To be perfectly honest, I dread the American remake (slated for 2008 by NEW LINE). Part of the appeal is that this film is verboten!! NEW LINE, I am quite certain, will be content will an \\"R\\" rating for theaters . . . and that will be a shame. Additionally, the Japanese version has insanely BAD and AWKWARD translation which only heightens its amusing qualities.      No, Battle Royale doesn't have the INSANE gore of Ichi the Killer, but it is faster-paced, has a simpler story-line, and in a way, is more shocking.    You'll either love it or hate it . . . me, I LOVE IT!!! I show it to my students EVERY semester!!!    This film receives FIVE stars for its innovative, no-holds-barred approach!!    Suggested Reading: Williams, Tony. \\"Case Study: Battle Royale's Apocalyptic Millennial Warning.\\" Japanese Horror Cinema. Ed. Jay McRoy. Honolulu: U Hawaii P, 2005. 130-143.
0670058971|5.0|I loved reading this book to my children, and they loved having it read to them, over and over and over.  Each child quickly memorized the easy rhyming text. <br />I have bought many copies  over the years, as new babies came along. <br />I like this  book so much I am buying a new copy for my upcoming first grandchild as I cannot bear to part with my original copy.
0743298020|5.0|Some of my least favorite books recently have been debut novels, with some notable exceptions.  I was also hesitant to read the Thirteenth Tale because of the chain-store hype it had been receiving.  But I was pleasantly surprised by a couple of things.    The plot jogged along with only a few pit stops for gatorade.  It was definitely an engaging gothic tale, or the remaking of one.  Maybe it was more of a homage to the gothic novel, much like Bellefleur by Joyce Carol Oats.  I was immediately drawn in and found the characters to be three dimensional, if not a bit bizarre.  I was willing to suspend my disbelief a couple of times, such as when Vida Winters emerges from such privation and neglect to become a paragon of the British literary world.  I felt that there was an acceleration of the pace at the end, and while I wanted to figure out who did what to whom, some of it seemed a little strained, especially with one of the plot resolutions which I cannot give away.  But this was not, for me, enough to diminish the overall strength of the novel.    Also, the writing was clean and disciplined, (unlike that of this reviewer) and helped the entire story to flow with ease.  One thing that kept throwing me was the change of narrator with little or no warning.  And since the latter sections of the book are mostly conducted in the first person, it can be a little confusing.  I would also have liked a little genealogical diagram in the front (or back), like One Hundred Years of Solitude, Bellefleur, though I am not making a comparison, even though it sounds like one.      My other impression was that this was not a book that took itself too seriously.  There was a slight tongue in cheek demeanor I found throughout, emphasized by the photo of the author who looks like the cat that ate the canary!  Anyway, it was great fun to read and I enjoyed it immensely.
0792833260|4.0|This is a pretty good movies, sometimes funny, sometimes sad with great acting by Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise also.  A film for all the family. <br />The life of Charlie have been change by his brother, after a week passed together, the business man is becomming human again.  A good lessons about values in life...money is not all after all. This is what this movie is about, a must have in any DVD collection.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|The actors were fantastic. They completely committed to these roles. And the cinematography was gorgeous: The yellow of the VW Bus mingled with the bright-blue sky was beautiful. And there were several genuinely funny moments: the sickly honk of the broken VW horn had me all a-giggle:) And I would not dream of quibbling with the dark-notes (Grandfather is a heroin addict, the father is a failed motivational speaker, uncle is a suicidal primadona, and the son is a psuedo-intellectual adolescent who refuses to speak and pretends to read Nietzsche). That's fine.    I have a feeling that the \\"disappointed\\" reviews that you find here are a result of the manner in which the film was promoted: as a \\"comedy.\\" I think that label is fairly deceptive. I would say that this film defies genre (which is always the hallmark of a truly innovative film). For instance, I think Boyle's Trainspotting and Kelly's Donnie Darko are hysterical masterpieces, but I surely wouldn't call them comedies. Similarly, I would be hard-pressed to label this \\"road-trip\\" film a \\"comedy.\\"     The work is well-worth the watch JUST TO SEE THE DANCE COMPETITION (no spoilers, but it is the best part of the film!) Just do not go into the piece expecting a laugh-riot . . . it is pretty subtle but thoughtful.     The film team admits to having great difficulty in finding a suitable conclusion to the work. While this contributes to your anxiety as a viewer, you should be aware that there are other endings included. Watch these alternate endings . . . one is superior to the actual conclusion . . . but I'll let you decide which:)     A good film, it just doesn't live up to the hype that the media and the masses constructed.
B00005JKHP|5.0|The long awaited movie of the Star Trek crew did not disappoint. This is the best of the Star Trek movies in my opinion. Gene Roddenberry thought so too. Thrilling scenes of the Enterprise coming out of dry dock. This director's cut adds some superb effects that don't stray from the original film intent. The storyline is pure and in keeping with TOS (The Original Series) the humor is there but not campy and over the top like some of the following Star Trek movies. Highly recommend .
B000002L7J|3.0|I gave two other Smiths CD 5 stars, the great 'The Queen Is Dead' and a Singles collection. This album just doesn't reach the level of TQID and therefore I have to give it just 3 stars.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Wow...action packed movie with a touch of drama. Jean Reno really plays the part well as The Assassin with a heart. Gary Oldman is awesome as the bad cop. Natalie Portman is Mathilda, she did really well. Now i'm not a fan of action, but my husband is, and i have to say that i really enjoyed this movie. If you love action, add this movie to your collection. Its a must...
B000JLTRKE|4.0|We all desire a film with a larger scope and a more generalized portrait of the events of September 11th; nonetheless, this film succeeds at revealing the harrowing experience of a small group of survivors/rescuers. I think that Stone does well in helping us begin to visualize the enormity of Ground Zero.  And this work helps us picture the underground structures in which these two men (and others) were trapped. Additionally, it bravely reveals the miscommunications which caused anguish for hopeful family-members. While some criticize this film for not underscoring the danger posed to the rescuers, I thought Stone did his best . . . as the rescuers/EMTs attempt to crawl to the officers, they are warned that they may die. Over and over, this is emphasized. So, for me, I think the rescuers bravery was well-portrayed.    Cage does a phenomenal job with his role as John McLoughlin: he is entirely believable . . . to the point where my companion and I even forgot it WAS Cage. Likewise for Michael Pena. Maggie Gyllenhaal also did a wonderful job at portraying Allison Jimeno: she played the role with quiet grace, thus allowing the emphasis to remain with the men trapped at Ground Zero. Now, that's great acting AND great directing!!     There was one seemingly minor problem which became more and more problematic as the film progressed. I know it sounds weird, but Maria Bello was either made to wear OR chose to wear bright-blue contact-lens in her role as Donna McLoughlin. Now, I had never seen this actress in film before and did not know she had dark brown eyes . . . but I DID notice the sloppy contacts and later investigated this on IMDB. The actresses dark brown eyes were not well concealed by these lens and it translated REALLY badly to film. Why does this matter, right?! It matters because every SINGLE time you see THESE HORRIBLE contacts, and BELIEVE ME you cannot miss it, you are reminded that this is a film . . . instead of remaining engaged in the film. From a technical perspective, it disrupts the audience's experience . . . and it a disservice to viewers to be pulled-out of such an important film. But, this is an annoyance which does not negate the overall value of this work!    This is a good film which is worth the watch. Moreover, it relieves anxiety that audience members KNOW they are watching a film where the featured police officers are rescued. For many, it is too early to watch a broader film . . . so this depiction of one \\"small\\" triumph is just what many need. And this film delivers that hope while STILL ACKNOWLEDGING the tremendous loss.     In sum, it is respectful and well-rendered.
B000M341XW|5.0|THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!  This is absolutely the best movie in the the past 5 years, let alone 2006.  There's something seriously wrong if Scorsese & crew don't sweep at the Oscar's this year.  Everything about this movie was awesome.  From the cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, \\"Marky Mark\\" Walhberg, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, & of course Jack Nicholson), their performances (Jack Nicholson was born to play this part, & Vira Farmiga deserves alot more attention as an \\"A\\" list star), the story & of course the direction.<br /><br />Because everyone and their mother have already gone over the plot, I'll skip that.  For those that don't know, \\"The Departed\\" is based on the 2004 Hong Kong film \\"Infernal Affairs\\".  Alot of people were skeptical that Scorsese wouldn't be able to come threw & pull off the film.  Scorsese took it, made it his own, & knocked it right out of the ball park.  There's not one dull moent all the way threw.  The action, comedy, drama, intense violence, & the suspense keep you totally strapped into your seat from beginnnig to end.<br /><br />As for the people complaining about the violence & language...  What were you expecting?  Have you not seen any of Scorsese's other work?  Did the \\"R\\" rating not clue you into what was in store?  Ya, this movies really bloody.  The violence isn't cartoony, it's real, intense, & horrifying, the way it should be in a movie.  If you don't want that, I'm sure you can just as easily go catch the latest Walt Disney money machine.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll step down off my soap box.  Just go see, buy or rent this movie.  This film will go down as not only true classic, but also as one of Scorsese's finest.

B00012QLQ4|5.0|i hate the fact that i'm repeating over 100 people right now, but this movie is not only one of the best anime's, but just plain out one of the greatest films of all time. this is true classic sci fi that will never be missed by anyone. this film will certainly be on everyone's must-see list next to the godfather, clockwork orange, american beauty, & jaws (no i'm not comparing, i'm stating as in a \\"films that must be seen\\" list)<br /><br />this film is much more than a those popcorn \\"classics\\", or even classic american sci fi for that matter, this is a film that falls more into that category of cinema for people who think.<br /><br />its certainly not a film everyone will like, but like i said before, its probably the most famous, or at least the most talked about anime & it draws upon some interesting concepts of a \\"cyberpunk\\" future, such as violent street gangs, government conspiracies & corruption, civil war & terrorism all within a dystopian metropolis. i mentioned cyberpunk, assuming that the film had taken much influence from sush early 80s cyberpunk as william gibson's neuromancer(ghost in the shell did so much much more) but particularly blade runner, which is technically considered in the same genre, but is assuredly one of the first masterpiece's to place a lot of the same subject matter in cinema on the map (futuristic, visionary, diverse, dystopian metropolis, humankind clashing with artificial intelligence, the protagonists are often \\"low-class\\" so to speak).<br /><br />all in all, if your looking for science fiction that'll make you think more than keep you at the edge of your seat, or your in love films like blade runner & ghost in the shell, than this one is up your alley.
B00005JP9V|5.0|Set in the U.K., we are introduced to Theodore Faron (Clive Owen), a working man who's daily routine is waking up miserable, going to work miserable, then falling to sleep at the end of the day miserable, with occasional shots of liquor in between.  It is hard to feel anything but miserable in this day and age, the year being 2027.  Chaos.  Soldiers around nearly every corner, resistance forces fighting endlessly, bombs going off in buildings everyday; much like modern day Iraq.  But in this era, no female has given birth to a baby in 18 years and on this day, the youngest human dies at 18.<br /><br />  The cast of this film needs to pat themselves on the backs for stellar performances.  The special effects were unreal and intense.  Though the story took place 20 years into the future, it is unlike most \\"futuristic\\" films where you see floating cars and laser weapons.  The setting could easily have been mistaken for today's generation, and director Alfonso Cuaron does an incredible job with his cast and crew to develop a unique adaptation of P.D. James' 1992 book, Children of Men.  A must see film for cinematic enthusiasts, but not all viewers will likely appreciate the occasional jumps and head-n-neck scratching that may occur due to the film's intensity.
0689878451|2.0|If you want to indocrinate your children with the message of \\"tolerance\\" (i.e., nothing is wrong or immoral), then this is the book for you. If you instead love all types of people but do not accept that everything they do is perfect, then this book is NOT for you. The gay overtones in this book are quite heavy, especially when the author writes that the two male penguins \\"must be in love.\\" <br /> <br />This book presents homosexual relationships as healthy and a good environment for rearing children - it's dangerous to indoctrinate your kids with these false notions. Tolerance is good and it is a virtue, but acceptance is not. I can tolerate immoral behavior, but I don't have to accept it, and this book overtly and needlessly glorifies the idea of homosexuality. <br /> <br />Since the book was written, the penguin couple has split-up; Silo left his male companion for Scrappy, a female penguin. This too tests our acceptance and is a testimony to diversity. Will there be a follow-up book?
B0000025US|5.0|This album is a miracle. I could stop here and you have enough words to understand the level this album belongs to. I'm bored when I read reviews where people point out a music as too technical or stuff like this. This music is technical for sure but it is absolutly marvellous and totally blazing on the emotional level. This album is a trip. When I listen to this one sometimes I find myself unable to listen to nothing else for a while. Technique is not against emotions especially in albums like this one! If you are not skilled enough to appreciate the beauty these players produced here, please, don't write reviews! This album is flamenco, jazz, classical, latin, it is simply three mindblowing musicians that united to produce the last word in acoustic guitar music and an unbelievable chapter in the history of music. But this album is not only incredible for guitarists, it is fantastic for everyone because the songwriting is amazing. The credits go to the three of them infact they choosed to record tunes from each one of them (two tunes each) and I can't say which are the best!! And every tune is the perfect sequel to the one that preceed it. It seems as it has been written by one single pen. This cd is even a fantastic audio experience if you have a good hi end system. Even if the tones could be better, the dynamic is there and you can hear each player on a different channel, so you have John in the centre, Paco on the right channel and Al on the left channel. You can recognize easily their different styles. You can follow the dialogs they are having improvising on these marvellous tunes. I own this one since 1990 I guess. It still impress me for the technical abilities of the solos and the compings, it still amazes me for the songwriting skills of these guys, and delight me on the emotional level each time I decided to take it out the vaults. A gem.

B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a great game for adults and kids alike. you learn to think in abstract and how things fit together. It forces you to think ahead with out all the rules of Chess. It is a little like tetris for 2-4 people with how you have to fit the pieces together to finish the game. We have bought 2 more since we got it for relatives. There is also a travel version for 2 people. Definitely worth the money.
B000J10ERO|4.0|I've never been a real big fan of comic books and have never seen a single Superman movie (although I did see that series with Dean Cain a couple times). I am familiar with Superman and, from what I can tell, this film is pretty good. It's not perfect (it's definitely way too long), but it's good, entertaining, and has some great special effects. The film is directed by Bryan Singer, who left the \\"X-Men\\" series to do this film and stars newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The movie opens with a title card that tells us that Superman disappeared for five years to explore his extinct planet Krypton. When he returns, he resumes his job at The Daily Planet under the alias Clark Kent but finds that things have changed. His love Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, 'Beyond the Sea') has a young son, Jason, and is engaged to the editor Richard (James Marsden, 'X-Men: The Last Stand'). Meanwhile, the evil and bald Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, 'American Beauty') has come up with a money-hungry plan for world domination...As Clark adjusts to his new life and returns to his role as Superman, Luthor discovers a way of getting lots of money AND killing Superman. Now, here are a couple problems with the movie. First, Lex Luthor's plan is idiotic...Although, that's usually the case with movie villains whether they're in a Superman movie or a James Bond movie. It's way too long...It's never dull and my favorite movie of all time has the same running time as this film, but it could've been trimmed. Bosworth's Lois Lane isn't incredibly likeable and Bosworth isn't really credible as a mother. But with the cons come the pros. Routh makes a credible Superman and the fact that he's an unknown makes it a lot more believable, because you're not thinking to yourself the entire time \\"That's Brandon Routh!\\" People have complained about Kevin Spacey's performance as Lex Luthor, because it's campy. And, yes, it is campy...But I think it works better this way. If he had played it straight, there would be nofun in it and with the plan Luthor has in the movie, campiness is the best choice. The movie co-stars <br />Frank Langella, Eva Marie Saint (as Clark's mother), Parker Posey (as Kitty, Luthor's girlfriend), <br />and Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's dad. There's a fascinating Bonus Feature on the 2nd disc, detailing how they digitally recreated Brando's role from the original and placed it in this film. <br />Posey is wonderful as Luthor's girlfriend, camping it up herself yet holding her ground against Spacey. Whenever there's a movie based on a comic book, people tend to lash out at the director. <br />Bryan Singer has taken a lot of heat, from the beginning of the \\"X-Men\\" trilogy to this film. I got to say, the dude is doing a pretty good job. Could someone better have directed this movie? Probably, but I wouldn't know who. \\"Superman Returns\\" should please fans of the comic book or just the casual viewer, despite its shortcomings. It's worth watching, at least once. <br /> <br />GRADE: B
B000HA4WT8|2.0|As the editorial reviewer noted, this movie is nonsensical.  I enjoy a good action-packed car movie at least as much as some but I feel impelled to write a review to balance out the unbelievable, nonsensical reviews that have come before.  While I'll agree that this movie is better than FNF2 it is nowhere near the original and it is a shame that this is another dud in what might have become a great franchise.   <br /> <br />It is unbelievable from the casting of 20(30)-year-olds to play the part of teenagers to the non-Japanese Asians hired to play Japanese characters to the basic premise that high-school students are able to hold driver's licenses in the first place.  This is not the Japan that I know at all and doesn't feel like it or look like it either - contrary to what another reviewer posted.   <br /> <br />The acting was wooden and the dialogue inane even though the characters were visually appealing.  The thing that made FNF1 a classic in the genre is that it was not only filled with hot cars and hot bodies but there was also a story that tied it all together.  This morality play is what made it worth watching - again, hot bodies and hot cars aside.  The subsequent FNF2 and FNF3 have lacked the story that brought us to the series.   <br /> <br />It seems producers forgot that and instead focused only on the visual aspects and none of the cerebral ones.  It's a shame because this could have been a much better movie than it was.  I wanted to love this movie but to give it a rating of 4 or 5 stars would be to make a total mockery of the rating system.   <br /> <br />I hope there is a Fast and Furious 4 but I hope the producers spend more time and money on the story than they have the past 2 attempts.  Going back to the raw basics that made the Fast and the Furious 1 great would go a long way to restoring the tarnished reputation brought by FNF2 and FNF3:Tokyo Drift.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|This movie is exellent but it is probably not how you think it is going to be.......    My boyfriend was disappointed that it did not tell a lot about the Trade Center and the attack but I really enjoyed the movie.....    This movie is based around three men that get trapped under the Trade Center as they went on duty as fire fighters trying to rescue people from the tower. These men get trapped and buried under the tower and rubbel but can communicate with each other, one guy dies and the other two men live and struggle for survival as they barely have oxygen. Both families are very worried and concerned that they have not heard from there husbands and start to lose hope after a long while of waiting. There are many flashbacks of these two men's families and kids before the attack on the World Trade Center and then it goes back to the present setting of there wives being worried again and also the men not knowing if they will ever see there wife again. The movie gives a good message of all of the people that died fighting to save the lives of others on the attack of the World Trade Center and also a message of the volunteers that helped to find people that were burried under the World Trade Center! These men lived because of the many people that never gave up searching for them and all of the people that were burried.     This movie was very very sad but the men make it out alive!! This will definitely make you realize how much you love and and care about your family (husbands, wives, and children) and will make you thank God that you are still blessed with your family. This is definitely a must see movie!
0385338694|4.0|I just couldn't stop read it. I was in trance all the time. This book is for all those who loved Ally McBeal, Ab Fab or why not any BBC series which makes you laugh your head off. It could scare my male colleagues - being a man myself, I didn't really care. The book is just worth it - DESPITE the ending! <br /> <br />Samantha is the name of the main personage of this book. She is 29 years old, lives in London and is pretty much busy, working as a lawyer. Her only dream is to be a partner. One small tiny wish of creating an order on her messy work desk reveals a rather huge mistake. Being a perfectionist - recognising myself - she just panics and leaves work. She doesn't know where she's going besides the fact that she ends up in a village outside London and is mistaken to be a housemaid. Well, she plays on - while paying Harrod's (the London shopping mall) a huge some of money for replacing her different mistakes in the household. Yes, she is one of many who hasn't had the time nor the energy to dive in the world of household duties. Why should she? <br /> <br />The contrast of a life outside the city, the tempo of countryside and the fact that she can have her weekend off (according to the herself, she has never had time for herself ...), she get this aha-feeling, that maybe this is life, maybe, one is not supposed to live in work every minute. To really enjoy doing nothing for example - or why not falling in love with the gardener, should I say anymore? <br /> <br />As all funny twisting thrilling stories, this one contains humour, sad moments, horrible embarrassing scenes, and all thru the book, the reader will have some sort of wisdom about life, work, chances, risks etc. The humour is just so British! <br /> <br />At the same time, I feel a bit critical towards its so clear contrastive sides: either you work every minute or not, either you will work and get burned out or not. The fact that she finds a relief in household duties makes me wonder: Could Kinsella have written the same story about a man, wanting to escape the tempo of work? He would surely tak'n a world trip or gone to the Canaries ... if we are supposed to be cliché. I would have him do a bit more differently. And yes, that's the itchy part of the book. I don't like the story hihi. The book becomes a bit traditional, at the same time, it shows how difficult it is to keep a household, it's not done in a 6 minutes, no, it's a full-time job ONLY done by women, and here we have to do a change. <br /> <br />In Sweden we men are starting to change - 20 percent of us sit home and take care of our babies, still we have a bit to go for the cleaning, still taking out garbage or writing review on Amazon ...however, I am positive about it. However, have your funny moment with book, whether in the tube, during the work pause or why not when cooking??? <br />
B000GB775E|3.0|There are much worse movies out there than this, and it certainly doesn't deserve the accolade of \\"Worst Movie of 2006\\". There are some reviewers out there who are taking movies way too seriously. Just My Luck is the perfect movie for chilling out to, switching off the brain, and just having fun. It's never gonna win any awards, like many of Lindsay's films. I think the main problem a lot of reviewers will have is the target audience. It's a very narrow target audience, appealing to the very young, and me. It doesn't help that the film is trying to \\"break\\" a UK band by featuring them in this. That band would be McFly and they are the bane of my life. They're awful. There was so much press about one of the (ugly) members, and Lindsay having a fling, but I highly doubt it.<br /><br />It's a simple, predictable storyline, stealing the same idea from Freaky Friday (which is superior), and taking the guy from Princess Diaries 2, Chris Pine, who I didn't remember, and don't think I'll be remembering him from this either.<br /><br />My real quibble (apart from McFly) is the cover of both the UK & US covers for the DVD. Lindsay, a natural redhead, and with more than enough freckles, has been completely airbrushed for both DVDs. She no longer sports a freckle on my copy of the DVD, and I find that very disappointing.<br /><br />Just My Luck is an average film, perfect for a rainy afternoon in, and switching off the brain. What's not to like?
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I don't know what's up with everyone, but this album is way better than her first one!  I think everyone else is on crack. <br /> <br />I live my life for music, and the first one is a \\"gimmick\\" album.  Kinda off beat, very simple melodies, throw in some beats....  For people who don't understand music, it's probably the best thing to be played on the radio.  But I think Gwen's 2nd album, musically, is way more mature and just 10x better than her first!  Besides \\"Wind it Up\\" and \\"Yummy\\", all her songs are just so much more put together than her first album.  REAL melodies, REAL songs, REAL writing... and also very catchy.  These songs actually have tunes people!  I don't get why everyone likes the 1st album more.... <br /> <br />Almost all the songs are good, but my favorite are definitely \\"My Sweet Escape\\" and \\"4 in the Morning\\". <br /> <br />For the musically challenged, go for the first one.  If you want to see Gwen evolve into something better, go for the second.
0060763280|5.0|I've read Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Think and Grow Rich, The Millionaire Real Estate Investor.  Which I believe are very good books and they get you pointed in the right direction and motivated.  This book is very easy to read and very little fluff.  It didn't have a lot of LONG drawn out stories to support his topic per chapter it was quite short.  Obviously I liked it and I think most people will too.  It was a bit irritating to read Millionaire Mind Intensive free seminar after every chapter but it doesn't take away from the books main points as some people have mentioned in their reviews.  <br /> <br />Motivational, inspiring, and a HOW-TO on changing your way of thinking.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|As many agree, Maiden has changed much over the years, with every album sounding different than the previous one. This album has some really great songs, but other than the those songs, the rest of the album just utterly sucks and is crowded with filler music. I can still respect Maiden for creating original music at their age, but some songs just need to not be made. The great songs that I talked about are: <br />Wildest Dreams: a great rocker with a great chorus and some good solos <br />Rainmaker: This song is a great song with great guitars <br />Dance of Death: the title track does deliver, it is an epic telling a dark and creepy story along with great music <br />Paschendale: HANDS DOWN! the best song on the album. This song is epic, starting with soft vocals followed the roar of heavy guitars. Bruce sings this song great and the chorus is priceless. One of Maiden's best songs, ever. <br /> <br />Despite the low points on this album, it's worth buying for these four songs.
1592289444|4.0|_The Long Walk_ is a testimony to how much the human spirit can endure in order to survive. The struggle for freedom keeps one reading. I find myself pondering his words and images he gives as he describes his experience. His story will stay with me forever.  <br />The construction of the American is also an interesting facet of this book. The American seems to be this heroic figure who escapes illness and death in his quest for freedom and in his contribution to the group's goal for freedom. The construction is contrasted with the construction of the Russian, as the author does not hide his contempt for the nation or its citizens, which also pulls the tension of the book much tighter.
B000009EAD|5.0|This is without a doubt, Iced Earth's best album. Every song on this album is enjoyable and then it has many great masterpieces. The vocals, lyrics, guitars, bass, and drums shine on this album. Heavy Metal with true musicianship. The best songs: <br />Burning Times: This song is slow and heavy. The vocals rule and the lyrics send chills down my spine. The chiming of the bells at the beginning and end sound really cool <br />Disciples of the Lie: This song is fast and heavy and will get your head bangin. It has a very haunting keyboard solo in the middle. <br />Consequences: this song is beautiful, a slow and soft one with great vocals <br />Prophecy: The best song in the trilogy and possibly the best on the album. It starts eerie and soft and then there is a short bass the solo that kicks this song up to speed. Great lyrics, vocals, and guitar work <br /> <br />This album is a must have for any metal fan
B000FTWB7G|2.0|perhaps my harsh judgment of this release is accented by the enduring excellence of Evanescence's first full length release, 'Fallen,' but it is difficult to play down my initial and immediate disappointment after hearing 'The Open Door' for the first time.      while 'Sweet Sacrifice' makes an ok intro, i was immediately struck by its mainstream, overworked angst and its uninspired, harsh-sounding riffs and arrangements that seem wanting for innovation.  nor did it do much to highlight what, in my mind, is the biggest strength of Amy Lee's formidable vocal arsenal: her ability to float her ethereal voice effortlessly over heavy, melodic instrumentation.      instead, this Evanescence album calls on Amy to perform harsh, loud sounds that compete with the guitars rather than glide over them.  a fundamental mistake in my opinion; she is not good at this, nor is it consistent with the 'evanescence sound' that fans such as myself were hoping to hear more of on this release.     things only get worse with the second track, 'Call Me When You're Sober,' a title no self respecting group that styles themselves as even moderately gothic would ever use.  the music is the worst in the history of Evanescence, compounding all the mistakes of the first track and making them worse.  after this song i had little hope left for the album.     however, there are some good moments on the disc, though perhaps too few to make the purchase really worth it.  'Lithium' builds nicely into an instrumental crescendo reminiscent of older, better days after a slower buildup.  'Cloud Nine' contains some eerie chanting and strings that are  very cool, but it dissolves sadly into an angst fueled chorus that reminds me of Godsmack in certain places more than any Evanescence song ever should. 'Lacrymosa' is perhaps the most like old Evanescence of any song on the album, and for that reason is probably also my favorite if i had to pick one.  'Lose Control' starts promisingly, but once again Amy duels the guitars and over-sings the chorus, effectively ruining the song.     and so it goes for the rest of the album as well; promising, tantalizing fragments of music, followed by irritating, all too mainstream, angst ridden choruses.     there is a ballad in the shape of 'Good Enough' but sadly it comes nowhere close to the emotional beauty of 'Hello' and 'My Immortal.' in fact it carries a sound wholly inconsistent with Evanescence throughout.  Needless to say i do not care for it.      fans of Fallen are encouraged to check out such artists as Nightwish, Within Temptation, Forever Slave, Stream of Passion, Collide, Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania, all of whom put this record to shame.    if you are into American style commercial rock like Korn, Linkin Park, Orgy, etc. this might just be your cup of tea.     i really wish i had more positives to write about this album, but as it is, it gets 2 stars for lack of innovation, catering to the mainstream masses, and inappropriately posing as gothic.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is the last excellent Metallica album. Everything after this was commercialized and sold out. Metallica still held true to themselves with this album. The weakness of this album is mostly just tinny sound due to the loss of their bass player Cliff Burton RIP. The best songs are: <br />Blackened: this song starts off soft with the guitars fading in to a climactic end, and then, boom!!! in come the thrashing guitars and drums with the dark lyrics war, a great thrash classic <br />And Justice for All: This song may be long, but it is a masterpiece. It starts soft, and gets into a great metal song. <br />One: this song is beautiful, it starts as a soft ballad, gets slow and heavy, and then explodes into great thrashing and a great Hammett solo
B000J103PC|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, mostly because of the humor and great acting. Though the size-six fat jokes got old when Anne Hathaway is one of the skinniest women they used in that movie. They should have asked her to gain five pounds.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, but never did emphathize with Andrea for facing the \\"devil\\" in fashion. To me, what Andrea's friend were upset with her for really was because she was working hard and trying to excel. The same thing happens at every job I've ever had, though we tend to eat as many carbs as we want.<br /><br />A supervisor at my father's old workplace was in charge of a project that was harsh and demanding on the employees and when people started to complain, he had a bunch of \\"I Never Promised You A Rose Garden\\" t-shirts printed up and handed them out at work.<br /><br />I never could identify with Andrea's delimna until the very last scenes. The ending wrapped the story up well.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"meeting\\" both Andrea and Miranda.

B00005S6K6|5.0|This is a lovely story about courtly love.  It is quite realistic and both DeNiro and Streep are perfectly cast - in fact, DeNiro says this is his favorite role, because it was a romantic story with Streep.  The DVD is in great shape, and it came quickly.  Thank you!
B0000CABBW|5.0|This film is fantastic and a real tear jerker. Everyone should view this film. All of my grand-children loved it. However the film is not only for children but also parents and grand-parents. What terrific lessons are learned from it. A must.

B00005JPCY|5.0|This was actually a film I was reluctant to see, mostly because I knew it had to do, in some part, with time traveling. Which is extremely difficult to pull off consistently and realistically, and most people fail when they try. In this movie, they didn't fail. They managed to make all the pieces fit together, and they made a very fun (albeit far fetched) enjoyable movie to watch.  <br /> <br />Add to that the superb acting of everyone in this movie (Denzel Washington plays his role to a T) and it's one of the most solid movies I've seen in awhile. It's not *special* enough to be Oscar quality, but its a movie you can enjoy watching again and again without getting bored or tired of it. And that's worth a lot, in my opinion. :)
0767827791|1.0|I've waited for years to get this wonderful classic on DVD and was so disappointed to discover it's only available in a full-screen format. For those who don't know the difference, this classic was originally filmed in a widescreen format, so to make it fit the traditional square television, they had to crop out a lot of the picture. What's more, this \\"restored\\" version contains no documentaries--only trailers and cast lists. I e-mailed Sony about a possible widescreen release and was told there are no plans for another release at this time. What a shame! The film was released on VHS in a widescreen format and deserved to be handled with the same respect in the DVD release. If you want to get the full impact of the theatrical release, don't buy this chopped-up version. Save your money and watch the VHS or widescreen airings on Turner Classic Movies. Eventually someone will do right by this film and release a better DVD.
B00005JPDJ|5.0|For what it is this is an absolutely fabulous movie! It's intent is to be a light-hearted, funny, and engaging romantic comedy. Not a deep, brooding movie.  <br /> <br />Kate Winslet, as always, plays her role with charm and vivacity, and identifies well with the \\"every day\\" woman. Almost equally well in this movie is the somewhat high strung and quirky movie trailer editor, played by Cameron Diaz. Jack Black plays a serious romantic interest...which I can never recall him played before, and sometimes you just burst out laughing because you know so bad he wants to make a funny face and bring some stupid comedy into the film. :) Jude Law is absolutely gorgeous as another love interest, and he does well in making the viewer fall totally in love with him.  <br /> <br />But I don't think this movie is just for women, either. I went and saw it with my boyfriend and we were both laughing out loud for  most of the movie. Just a very charming, delightful romantic comedy, that leaves you feeling happy and satisfied at the end! :)
0670038040|5.0|RUMPOLE AND THE REIGN OF TERROR is just about as perfect as a novel can be. I feared that Mortimer might make a misstep, given the \\"timeliness\\" (actually, timelessness) of his theme (the defense of our hard-won legal rights), but the storytelling is wonderfully sure and subtle. Mortimer never tells when he can show, and he writes volumes between the lines. (What a master of understatement and informing by indirection!) All the various themes and storylines (Hilda's flirtation with divorce, Rumpole's reaction to this, the way Rumpole is viewed by others in the legal system and how he views them, the subject of terror and the law) reflect brilliantly on each other and come together seamlessly at the end. The sum is more than the parts -- a feat of novelistic magic -- and there can be no higher praise than that.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This heartwarming story reminds us that \\"common sense\\" is not always \\"reality\\".<br /><br />Common sense tells us that a store Santa at Macy's should push only Macy's products to customers. Otherwise, Macy will be throwing away business. Instead, the new store Santa (Kris Kringle) sometimes refers the customers to a competitor (Gimbels) when the latter has the product that the customer actually wants. The counterintuitive result? Customers appreciate this and Macy's sales go way up.<br /><br />Common sense tells us that a man who is convinced that he is Santa Claus is delusional, and may become violent. The psychologist at Macy's recommends that Kris Kringle be committed into a mental institution. Will common sense prevail?<br /><br />The mother of little Susie, evidently embittered by her divorce, wants to disabuse her daughter of anything like Prince Charming or Santa Claus. Only real things should matter. Little Susie does not even know how to play imaginative games with other children her age. Kris Kringle must teach her how to pretend to be a monkey. Finally, both mother and daughter are forced to reconsider their \\"common sense\\" attitudes towards Santa Claus.<br /><br />Common sense tells us that there is no Santa Claus, and no court should ever waste its time on this matter. The judge doesn't know what to do. If he rules according to common sense, that there is no Santa Claus, he will commit political suicide. There is no way of canceling the court proceedings, and it is impossible to prove the existence of Santa Claus, much less that old man Kris Kringle is actually Santa Claus. Right? I won't spoil the ending. Watch the movie and find out!

B000JLTRJ0|5.0|I see that many people here were not happy with this film. They all say that the film moved to slow or that it did not show the full story of what happened in 9/11. If anyone saw the trailer of this movie they can clearly see that the plot showed that it was a story of 2 police officers trapped in the rubble of the WTC. And now when everyone sees the movie they act surprised of the outcome. I know That many people would choose United 93 but this was better than that film. It's a great film don't get me wrong it's just besides the fact that the recorded telephone calls of the victims to there famillies were in fact accurate. When they are talking to each other and when even the terrorist talk to each other they were made up diologue. This film on the other hand is living proof of what really happened inside the rubble and above. The 2 officers and the rescuers collaberated with Oliver making sure that it was done right. Even the diologue was made sure that it was really said by the victims and rescuers. This film get a 5 star for me the rest of you keep on with your sorry complaints of how it was not what you expected. This is a archive that our children can see in the future and see what happened to these 2 brave men in a day that many of us wish never happened.
B00005JPDS|3.0|Down on his luck Chris Gardner (Smith) sells bone density scanners to local hospitals and doctors in 1981 in San Francisco.  His wife Linda (Newton) is unpleasant and demanding.  His son, Christopher, is a happy kid, but is effected by his parents' disharmony.  Soon, Linda leaves him and he is evicted from his home.  He has little money, and his hopes lie with an internship program at Dean Witter.  He is the least likely of the bunch to succeed in the class until he amazes the program head by solving his Rubik's Cube.  He enters the program and struggles to do that as well as sell his scanners and raise his kid.<br /><br />This is your standard rags to riches story.  With an emphasis on the rags part.  \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is pretty much a downer for 90 minutes as Chris must deal with everything that is thrown at him.  Will Smith does a good job making Chris feel like a real person.  He is not perfect, but he tries really hard, and that makes him easy to like.  His real life son Jayden is also good as Christopher.  This is an OK movie with a good performance by Smith that may benefit him come Oscar time.  If you are looking for an inspiring movie, this may fill that need.

B000HIVO64|3.0|I was expecting this cd to be more like Guero, with strange lo-fi sounds massaging my brain.  But it didn't have that element to the music.  The music is really polished, but lacks the dynamism that some of his earlier work has.

Second time's a dud - less dance oriented, more dance-psychedlia from the same era.  I was never one who took them for that disco label, anyway; too many Cat Stevens-style pabulum within the grooves.  They are still, to overuse and already overused clich&eacute;, all style over substance, and the new-wave aesthete they adhere to results in static cling with nary a toe-tapper in earshot.  It's still camp.  But there's no pop.  My grade:  C+

B00007GZR5|5.0|There's an author by the name of Richard Matheson, who's better known for his horror fiction (I Am Legend and Hell House) and the teleplays that he wrote for the original Twilight Zone series in the sixties (the most famous being Nightmare at 30,000 Feet).  This is the man who had the greatest influence on Stephen King when he was a teenager and an aspiring writer.  What many people don't know is that Richard Matheson also wrote two very powerful novels about undying love and soul mates, both of which were turned into successful movies--Somewhere In Time in 1980 and What Dreams May Come in 1998.  This posting is about What Dreams May Come.<br /><br />What Dreams May Come was written by Richard Matheson as a way of saying a big \\"thank you\\" to his wonderful wife.  He wanted to write a book that would show his love for her in a very special way.  When the novel was originally published, one of the producers of Somewhere In Time read it and decided that he would eventually turn the book into a movie.  This finally came about in 1998.  The movie, What Dreams May Come, starred Robin Williams as Chris Nielsen and Annabella Sciorra as his wife, Annie.  The story is a sad one; yet, it does have a positive ending.  More importantly, it has a strong message about life after death and how we choose to come into this life to be with the people we love and need to learn from.  In a sense, this is the unique power of love.  When you truly love someone, the energy of that emotion never goes away, no matter how many years or centuries may pass.  Love is eternal.<br /><br />The story of What Dreams May Come (there are plot spoilers here, so beware) deals with a middle-aged couple that has lost their two children due to a traffic accident.  They have struggled to rebuild their lives and to carry on their journey together.  But, another traffic accident takes Chris's life, and Annie is left alone to deal with her guilt and heartache and emptiness.  As Chris's spirit gradually accepts his death, he moves into the after life, or to a very special place that's built on happy memories from his previous life.  You could say that it's the place where dreams are born.  He meets the man who helped trained him to be a doctor and is guided by him in an effort to readjust to this new state of being.  Eventually Chris will encounter his two children, whose memories have never left his heart.  In time, however, he finds out that Annie has committed suicide.  She found herself unable to go on without him.  Because of her belief system and because her death is a suicide, Annie's spirit ends up in what might be referred to as hell.  Chris refuses to accept that he may never see Annie again and decides to go after her.  Though no spirit has ever done this before, Chris is determined to make the journey to hell and to bring his wife back.  This is the strength of his love for her.  If he can't bring Annie back, then he'll stay in hell with her for the rest of his existence.<br /><br />Needless to say, you need a big box of Kleenexes when you watch What Dreams May Come.  This movie has a number of poignant moments about true love and death and the people who are interconnected to us.  The photography and special effects are awesome.  The movie makes you believe in life after death, and that it can be the most beautiful place that one's mind can imagine.  I think this is one of the reasons the film had such a powerful affect upon me.  When I saw it at the movie theater in 1998, I continued to sit there for at least ten minutes after the end credits had rolled.  I wasn't the only one, either.  That night, I went to see it again with some friends, and we all seemed to experience the same kind of sensation when the movie ended.  It touched something deep within us that was desperately needed.  I think that as human beings, we need these very special experiences every so often in order to keep us moving through the ups and downs of life.  Without these moments in time that touch our hearts and souls, we would simply be moving forward as if on autopilot.  There's about twenty-five minutes of extras on this DVD that deal with the making of the movie.  Highly recommended!arts and souls, we would simply be moving forward as if on autopilot.

B00004Y6NM|5.0|(1985) I think this album is a new dawning for Clapton.  He's clean & reinvigorated & for the first time really focused on production & muscianship.  First of all, Clapton & Collins (by this time) had been friends for almost ten years.  They had played togther with John Martyn (1981), Steven Bishop (1981), & on Collins's Face Value (1981).  So clapton didn't just recruit collins because he was the most sought-after producer/drummer of the 80s.  He recruited him because he deeply respected Phil's ability to produce, motivate musicians, unlock hidden talent, & take them to a higher peak of perfection.  Another notable about Collins was he was never a drunk or junky.  He was a music man & very professional.  12-16 hour studio days aren't possible if you're all screwed up on dope.  Now that Clapton was clean from heroin he could seriously focus on his music & there was noone better to recruit then Collins(known as the busiest man in Rock). Clapton's best attribute is being humble & modest.  he has played with so many people because he wants to constantly change & improve.  This is why Phil Collins produced & toured with him.  ted Templeton (van halen / doobie brothers) also produced 3 of the 11 tracks here (forever man / something's happening / see what love can do).  There are alot of musicians on this one including nathan east (bass), greg phillinganes (keyboards), john robinson (brand x & phil collins touring keyboardist), jamie oldaker (drums), jeff porcoro of TOTO (drums), ray cooper (percussion), steve lukather of TOTO (guitar), Donald duck Dunn (bass), marcy levy (long time clapton vocalist/cowriter), & many others.  The opening track \\"She's Waiting\\" explodes with strong drumming & hard rhythm keyboard tracks indicating that Phil Collins was conducting this train & Clapton was more than happy to let him.  Even though Jamie Oldaker was drumming there's no doubt who was fuelling his rhythm patterns (Collins).  There is also a great bluesy track called same old blues that is more or less a 1980s blues song that is powerful & compelling.  Throughout the album you can hear the strong Phil Collins trademark drum patterns & production.  On \\"Tangled in Love\\" the sequencer pattern used is so genesis-like that you would think that rutherford & banks (genesis pals) are in the studio as well.  Clapton's vocal performances are also the strongest he's ever recorded again indicating that Collins must have pushed him to push himself vocally.  The collins/clapton relationship would continue on the road (phil at drums) at LIVE AID, on tour with East & Phillinganes (producing an awesome 1986 Montreaux Festival appearance), & on another album in 1986 called August which would prove to be another huge album. A great producer can bring out amazing potential in a musician & that is what Phil Collins did with Clapton & also Robert Plant.  Clapton & Collins continued to work together on other albums including But Seriously & Journeyman.  This relationship, I think, created some of the best produced & most mature music of the 1980s & early 1990s. At this time (1985-86) Collins was very busy balancing his own solo work (no jacket required - 1985) & genesis's 1986 invisible touch but he would find breaks during tours & albums to work with clapton again & again indicating that their relationship was very important to them.

I loved this guy, and his book is just as good!  It's clear cut, concise, and I finally FINALLY understand the structure of a script!  Something I have been struggling with, despite the interest and feedback from production companies on my script.  I am working on a final draft now that I hope to sell!  And he's very available and gives his e-mail out in the book and welcomes comments and questions which is great!  I highly recommend this book!  5 STAR RATING!
B000001DQI|3.0|1973 I'm hot & cold with Elton John.  This albums represents all of the things I don't like including poor drumming by Nigel which is typical through the 70s, poor production (candle in the wind for example), & poor overall arrangements.  Elton & Bernie's songs are strong but they have always had trouble getting them on to tape well.  Elton used the same musicians through the 70s & 80s.  I'm convinced that he could have had stronger musicians such as steve gadd, jeff beck & others to make his music more powerful. Let's not even talk about saturday night's alright, candle in the wing, bennie & the jets because they've been done to death & they are rather week songs.  First of all this was a very successful double album... Secondly,  jamaican jerk-off is fairly good & it's more musically historical because of the drum machine beat it is set around.  this has to be one of the first times a drum machine is used in music so that is important. I also like I've seen that movie too.  \\"Funeral\\" has one of the most aggressive synthesizer solos to date but again, it could have been stronger if you would have had chick corea or tony carey from Rainbow. I like this song has no title mostly because elton didn't over due it & put alot of crappy drums in there.  sometimes I think elton sounds better if he just plays piano but that's hard to find on his studio albums. All the girls love alice is interesting & it's about a married bisexual woman who screws around with girls when her husband is out of town - interesting, especially for 1973.  I also like social disease & harmony as these songs are complete with good vocal performances.  Elton did most of his own backup vocals in the 70s & they were pretty good & complete.  I don't know... I have mixed emotions about elton but this album is definitely a classic wheter I love it or not
B000005JH5|5.0|\\"When I'm dead, I think I'll come haunt you as the sunset.\\" ~Catherine in Wuthering Heights (1970)<br /><br />Creatures from the ocean and forest are as comfortable dancing around Kate Bush's voice as the music that seems to spin a magic spell over the listener. As she sings \\"Oh to be in love, and never get out again...\\" you can feel her wistful longings.<br /><br />I tried listening to this on my stereo and then another CD player and couldn't hear the lyrics as well as on my headphones. The clarity of her voice is exquisite on the K240 AKG headphones. They are worth buying to listen to this album.<br /><br />Every word has a renewed clarity and the lyrics are wildly poetic and the way Kate sings gives me shivers. Her music has a highly creative appeal. This is the type of album you listen to with the lyrics in hand so you can experience every nuance and understand every element of the story. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is especially beautiful:<br /><br />\\"Out on the wiley, windy moors<br /><br />We'd roll and fall in green<br /><br />You had a temper, like my jealousy<br /><br />Too hot, too greedy<br /><br />How could you leave me?<br /><br />When I needed to possess you<br /><br />I hated you. I loved you too...\\"<br /><br />If you enjoy music by Tori Amos, Sarah Brightman or Bjork, I'm convinced this will impress you. Kate Bush has a breathlessly beautiful voice that can be as smooth as honey or as sharp as ice. The clarity in her voice is stunning and this is not just an album you can listen to casually, this is a soul experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000000OXH|3.0|1983 - after a huge 1982 #1 freshman album it was hard to go back in the studio & equally impress a 2nd time.  The same line up is here one final time (howe/downes/palmer/wetton) & tensions between wetton & the others, especially howe, were high.  It was mostly over wetton's need for musical control as he obviously dominated the arrangements.  Some will recall the MTV 1983 special in japan with greg lake (not able to handle wetton's demanding vocal arrangements) taking wetton's spot.  Anyway, the same formula remains in Alpha but the tracks arejust not as strong.  I liked don't cry just fine & the smile has left your eyes but I think they're both overproduced.  I find myself listening to midnight sun & open your eyes as wetton's & downes's performances are both phenomenal.  I am a huge wetton fan & he always has very demanding vocal tracks.  Howe's guitaring is good but drowned out & muted.  palmer is normal palmer with his typical ELP style.  I think the ASIA albums would have benefitted from a larger drum set with higher toms & more technical drum fills.  Well, that's carl palmer...   Downes is doing his normal stuff & uses somes vocoder (which I love) on open your eyes.  Overall, good album & the last time until now (2007) that all 4 guys will play together.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Clear crisp notes dipped in acoustic perfection. Listening to music on the AKG Acoustics Semi-Open Headphones is like falling in love for the first time. You may start to feel breathless as notes wash across soundscapes unveiled in moments of sheer amazement.<br /><br />What beauty these headphones reveal. Every note is placed perfectly in a musical clarity revealing a perfect harmony and depth as sound swells and breaks and takes off in all directions like universes of sound.<br /><br />This is not an exaggeration, but rather an admission of fact. Let's just say that if a friend gave you these, you would love them forever.<br /><br />If headphones can make you feel weak in the knees...these will. The AKG headphones are also surprisingly comfortable and lightweight.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000002IP1|4.0|(november 1989) Lots of good musicians on this one - Clapton, Crosby, Winwood, Bishop, Leland Sklar, Pino Paladino, & more.  By this time, Collins had established himself as a heavily sought after drummer & producer outside genesis & his solo stuff.  So when it came time to ask his buddies clapton & others to join in they could only say yes...  This album is much more organic & unproduced than no jacket required & really a different album all together.  The pheonix horn's (originally from EWF, who had toured with collins & played on last 3 solo albums) sounds much more stripped down but as technical as NJR.  Collins (alone & with genesis & others) has a reputation of not recording live all at once. instead he chooses to record a guide rhythm part & then lets each musician lay their parts on top of it as to let the players work on their parts & improvise to perfection.  This album, though, was recorded more live with more of the musicians playing together in the studio simulaneously.  This was a bit of a new direction for collins as he is known as an incredible perfectionist.  Also, this album was recorded at the Gensis studio (the farm) & in LA which, I think, leads to it sounding a bit uneven.  this album is also much more politically & socially expressive as collins writes more about homelessness & political strife in the world (another day in paradise, colors, heat on the street, others).  This album also finds Collins getting away from the divorce-based love songs he is so well known for in his solo work.  His drumming & acoustics are, as usual profoundly awesome & much less electronic as he decided to use mostly his acoutic gretsch drums on this one.  There is also less drum machine & more percussion.  Also, collins's & david crosby's harmony's are incredible as their slightly monotone voices complement eachother perfectly (another day in paradise & that's just the way it is).  Phil also shows his ability to play great rhythm piano (electric yamaha cp-70) partshe is so well known for (colors & do you remember).  This album was followed by a 130 date world tour & was #1 in US & UK for most of 1990 with four top 5 hits (per usual with collins & genesis albums).  Clapton also does awesome work on wish it would rain down.  This album shows collins's ability to change musical directions & also be very commercially successful.  Great Album!!!
B00008QSAA|4.0|buen debut de una banda que lamentablemente no tuvo mas que decir....gran muestra de polenta y autenticidad, aunque en obras posteriores se halle poco de esto.....mountain no es cream, aunque lo intento ser. en esta placa se hallan los temas que inmortalizaron a mountain en woodstoock..nada mas.
B0000025P9|3.0|(1982) The last really good TOTO album...  hard to believe this album is 25 years old now...  Paich, Steve & Jeff Porcoro, & Steve Lukather fresh off their sessions & cowriting of the MJ Thriller album had alot of confidence going into TOTO IV.  This album did get the album of the year grammy in 1983 & was #1 for quite a while due to Rosanna, Africa, & won't hold you back.  Other wise this album is average & I think it's due to Jeff Porocoro's (RIP) predictable 4/4 time signature drumming.  Although a great & highly sought-after session drummer outside of TOTO (clapton, Skaggs, MJ, others), Jeff's drumming was very redundant & boring.  he had great acoustics & syncapation ability but almost every TOTO song is in 4, 8, & occassionally 16 time (typical pop production).  Otherwise Lukather has great guitar work here & hungate's bass work is muted & average.  Paich's & Kimball's harmonies are good as usual.  Don't get me wrong, I like this album.  Africa is a great song & features Tim B Schmidt (eagles/poco) & lenny castro percussion & has great vocals & is one of my favorite songs.  Rosanna is awesome & the guitar & keyboard work is great.  Lukather's I won't hold you back is also emotional with again, great vocals.  This album reminds me of being a young kid in 1982-83 & all people played was rosanna & africa.  Toto IV gave 3-4 strong vocal & musical arrangements which evolved into songs that earned redundant radio play to this day (2007).  I think these guys had alot of potential to throw in some complete 8-9 minute songs with large amounts of keyboards & drumming.  It just never happened.
0345404475|3.0|A thought provoking story, but too scattered to bring any one idea into focus.  The movie it inspired, \\"Blade Runner\\", was much better.
B00003CXGG|4.0|`Romeo Must Die' may not be the most original or the most entertaining martial arts film, but it's one of those movies that will please most viewers and warrant repeat viewings.  Jet Li is one of my favorite martial artists and here he showcases some of his great talent in a variety of scenes.  One football scene in particular stands out in my mind.  The film follows Han (Li) as he escapes prison and travels to Oakland in order to avenge the gang murder of his brother Po (Jonkit Lee).  When Han arrives he finds that his family is rivaling another gang run by Isaak O'Day (Delroy Lindo).   <br /> <br />In true `Romeo + Juliet' fashion, Han strives up a liking with Trish (Aaliyah), Isaak's daughter and problems (and fights) ensue.  Li does a fine job commanding this film, but it's Aaliyah who really shines and steals the thunder.  Anthony Anderson is also hilarious as Trish's bodyguard Maurice, and Delroy turns it yet another commanding performance.  The fight scenes are highlights, and there are plenty of them here, but look for surprise chemistry between the two leads that makes this film that much more memorable.  Like I said, this is `Romeo + Juliet' with a happy ending, but that never hurt anybody!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\", is an incredible piece of work. Albeit I didn't believe when people said it was a comedy after I saw it. I thought it was really depressing personally. I think it's because it's so true to real life. When this movie was recommended to me by a friend it was described as \\"funny\\". My friend was amazed to find that I found it quite depressing because it was so close to real life and the things I've found about life. I recommend this movie because it was a work of art in itself. Unlike other movies about a quirky family that goes on a trip together this one had a more realistic plot to it. It had a happy ending, in a sense. Not like a \\"I'm so glad that they got out alright\\" ending but more like a \\"I'm glad that it sort of worked out right at the end.\\" I recommend seeing this. Yay!
B000JJS8TM|1.0|i had three different dvd's and none would play on my system, the music is great but the 5.1 surround sound is not there. very disappointed <br />
B0000844I8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and was one of the first to jump on the series bandwagon. Kurt Russell does a good job playing the emotionally wounded Jack O'Neil who has been trying to cash in his chips but couldn't really go through with suicide. THIS mission was as good as suicide to him - so he volunteered, never planning to return. <br /> <br />The story is that of an evil ruler who uses humans a slave labor and to propagate his species. He has no compassion for human kind and only wants to be worshipped as a god. <br /> <br />But he isn't a god...just a power-hungry tyrant, a parasite (symbiant) that takes over the body of a human host. He is SO technically advanced, he appears to more primative peoples as a god. <br /> <br />A stargate is found buried in Egypt. They figure out how to use it and travel intrastellarly, happening on some seemingly human people on another planet. The team helps to free them from oppression, an adventure that gets you rooting for the good guys and want the bad guy to be destroyed. <br /> <br />That's what a good versus evil movie is supposed to do. You leave the experience uplifted that good does triumph in the end. The story, the sets, the special effects - are all balanced and interweave well. You feel like you are apart of the story, not watching a movie. <br /> <br />I love the way this movie just gels - that type that a scifi fan just loves. That is why the series has been so successful. Not only did they pull 2 characters from the movie, but they've kept it true to form. <br /> <br />If you don't have this in your collection, buy it. My brother tried to watch the series without this movie as a foundation and didn't understand it. Watching this does make following the series easier, especially as characters are referenced that were in the initial movie. <br /> <br />2 thumbs up!!!
B000096IBI|5.0|\\"Modern Times\\" begins with a shot of sheep going down a runway followed by a shot of workers entering a factory... Charlie is set down in the midst of industrial civilization, which is dominated by machinery and in which men are organized into mechanical units, Capital and Labor... Charlie's real enemies are no longer the Cop or the Boss, with whom he can always enter into some human relation, but a vast impersonality, invisible and invulnerable...<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" offered a variety of minor attractions: it featured Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard; it had wonderful gags; it indulged in tricks of sound which came to the very edge of being dialog... But what did the picture mean, what was it trying to say? Because Chaplin charged his usual enormous percentage for it, and because of foreign receipts, \\"Modern Times\\" made money, but exhibitors were not happy at the limited audience turnout... For the majority, the new Charlie was too serious; for the minority, not serious enough...<br /><br />Since the picture seemed to be about the dehumanizing effect of machinery, intellectuals called upon Chaplin to join them in reorganizing machine culture to some more human scale of things...<br /><br />Off the screen, Chaplin said nothing... On the screen, his anarchic hostility for any kind of machine culture expressed itself in scenes like that in which Charlie is fed by a machine and that in which, crazed by the assembly line, he runs into the street, his arms moving convulsively like two pistons... Charlie the rebel, Charlie the poet, Charlie the invincibly human, had been turned into a machine...

B0002B15XI|4.0|In the Seventies, while the Hollywood mainstream foundered, the finest American films were made by Robert Altman... A natural outsider, he intuitively opposed the heroic traditions of Hollywood's seamless narratives to create a fresh, personal style and a consistently provocative critique of The American Dream...<br /><br />Only with \\"MASH,\\" however, did his unique style first make itself felt... This seemingly chaotic black comedy, about a mobile army medical unit's anarchic adventures during the Korean War, made inventive use of a large cast, barely comprehensible multi-track dialog and a spontaneity of performance verging on the improvisational... But for all its gleeful mockery of conventional war heroics, the film (clearly intended to evoke the Vietnam War) was flawed by cynical clich&eacute;; sadly, but perhaps not surprisingly, it remains Altman's greatest commercial success...
0743289412|3.0|Lisey's Story is definitely a mixed bag. I'm glad to see King try something different. I just wish that he had trusted himself to jump completely into the pool, instead of just wading in up to his knees. Instead, he goes back to what is familiar (and financially rewarding). <br /> <br />King is a master at horror. What makes him so masterful is that he understands our terror on a much deeper level and forces us to confront it. Whether it be a rabid dog clawing at our car window, or a clown haunting the sewers of our childhood, King finds the stories most are too scared to tell and tells them to us. Simply. Convincingy. Hauntingly.  <br /> <br />But having read King since I was 12, I don't need the overt horror of his earlier bloodfests. I have to admit, I was sucked in to this story of a woman confronting her own horror. Not a buried pet come back to life. But, rather, a woman who discovers that it's not just scary being alone after 25 years of marriage, it's even scarier when you realize how much of a stranger that person was in many ways. When the one person you're supposed to be closest to in life spends time in an entirely different world. A world you don't really understand until it's too late to share it together. That's a new kind of horror. <br /> <br />So, this subtle shift got me excited about the directions King could go with his writing. Instead, he went back to one of his old standbys, a crazy intent on finishing off the protagonist. I finished the book and felt like I'd been in most of these places before, and met these exact same characters before. I wish he'd given Lisey a better reason for going back to Boo'ya Moon, rather than to finish off some wack-job.  <br /> <br />King has written well enough for long enough to know that a character's motivation is key to his or her development. Without it, there's no story. Fear is a great motivator. King has made a career out of creating characters who respond to it and grow from it. I just felt like the story would have been better had he given Lisey a different reason. Heck, simple curiosity would have probably done the job. Instead, he went back to one of his same parlor tricks we've been watching for decades. I'm not entirely tired of the game, I just want to see what else he's got up those sleeves. There's definitely something. It might not be scary, but it's something I'll enjoy reading more than I enjoyed Lisey's Story.
0767817486|4.0|\\"Midnight Express\\" is the upsetting true story of an American youth detained at Istanbul Airport trying to smuggle several packets of hashish...

B000EULJLU|2.0|After many listens to this album it seems to me they wrote about 20 minutes of songs, and the rest is just filler, and unlike Aenima where there would be a 5 minute slowly fading intro in to an awesome song (eulogy) in this album there is a 5 minute intro and then a bad song, or even no song at all.  There are alot of tracks that aren't even songs, just indian chants or stupid stuff like that.  The 3-4 songs that actually are songs on this album are good but the other 45 minutes is really poor.  The 3D effects on the covers are really great though, maybe they thought they had to do something to sell this record, so well give it a fancy cover.

630522577X|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is radiant and touching as the poor flower seller Eliza Doolittle who challenges her mentor's makeover powers, before eventually passing for a lady in London society... She is skillfully transformed into an elegant lady by a speech professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and taught to speak properly... From first frame to last, the film is slick, graceful, gorgeous to behold, with costumes and sets richly evoking the Edwardian era...<br /><br />'My Fair Lady' begins in London, on a rainy evening outside Covent Garden, where a 'respectable girl' is selling bouquets of violets... Professor Henry Higgins, a phonetics and linguistics expert, confronts the 'deliciously low so horribly dirty' Eliza Doolittle for the first time...<br /><br />In the best tradition, their first songs reveal their characters: 'Wouldn't It Be Loverly?' expresses Eliza's own ideas of what she dreams, while in 'Why Can't the English Learn to Speak' Higgins sings his despair over the deterioration of the English language, and displays his hard, irritable, intolerant, and elegantly arrogant nature...<br /><br />Lerner and Loewe's songs are shear delight as the story moves from Higgins's wager with sympathetic Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) that he can change the street girl with a strong cockney accent into a different human being by teaching her 'to speak beautifully' and pass her off in an upper class lady within six months... Higgins and Pickering are both single men, and the housekeeper, Mrs. Pearce, has misgivings about the way in which they are proposing to amuse themselves without caring about the consequences for the \\"common ignorant girl.\\"<br /><br />The songs are extraordinary in their ability to enrich our knowledge of the characters... Higgins' early song 'I'm an Ordinary Man' confirms that he is a 'quiet living man' without the need for a woman... Alfred Doolittle's 'With a Little Bit of Luck ' not only states his general philosophy of life, but exposes the perfect portrait of a friendly scoundrel... Eliza's father, who calls himself one of \\"the undeserving poor\\" is one of Shaw's best comedy creations... When he arrives to protest at the immorality of Higgins and Pickering treatment of his daughter, it soon becomes clear that he just wants to gain something for himself out of the situation... Eliza, becoming subject to Higgins' intimidation, belts out her discomfort at the rude, selfish Higgins, imagining a king ordering his death, in \\"Just You Wait, 'Enry 'Iggins.\\"<br /><br />The music is also a logical extension of the characters' feelings... When Eliza finally pronounces impeccably: 'The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain,' Higgins can hardly believe what he has heard: ('By George, she's got it. Now once again, where does it rain?'), and Eliza ('On the plain! On the plain!') and Higgins simply cannot be contained ('And where's that soggy plain? ') Eliza responding: In Spain! In Spain! They sing a duet together to celebrate their success... The scene leads to one of the most triumphant sequences in musical history...<br /><br />Further, the stunning scene in which Eliza Doolittle appears in high society when she meets Higgins's mother (the impeccable Gladys Cooper), and attends the Ascot races... She instantly charms a young admirer Jeremy Brett (Freddy) by her slightly odd manner of speaking, who later haunts Higgins' house (\\"On the Street Where you Live\\").<br /><br />The climax comes at the Embassy Ball, where Higgins' prot&eacute;g&eacute;, now \\"an enchanting young lady\\" charms everyone with her beauty... Her exercise is an unqualified success... Her waltz with the Queen's son, and other dance partners, spreads throughout the audience about her identity...<br /><br />Henry and Pickering are ecstatic... They congratulate each other for their \\"glorious victory,\\" ('You Did It'), but Eliza is hurt and angry at being ignored... They barely acknowledge her presence... She is no longer a part of any world... When Higginsreturns for his slippers, which he has forgotten, Eliza flings them angrily at him, and voices her feelings: 'Oh, what's to become of me? What am I fit for?'<br /><br />In an attempt to find her true identity a frustrated Eliza encounters Freddy who declares his love for her, but she returns to the populated flower market outside Covent Garden, where no one recognizes her... Her own 'miserable' father - tuxedo-dressed - gives her the cheerful news that he is about to get married...<br /><br />In the closing scenes, Higgins is upset to discover Liza has left him and is led to wonder why 'can't a woman be more like a man? Men are so honest, so thoroughly square.' Eliza surprises Higgings with her decision to marry Freddie, and claims: 'I shall not feel alone without you. I can stand on my own without you. I can do bloody well 'Without you!'<br /><br />At his home, at dusk, Higgins ultimately recognizes Liza's quality... He recalls Liza and realizes how much she has come to mean to him...

B00005O3VC|3.0|The movie was quite a drag compared to \\"SPAMALOT\\" currently on stage.  And the special features were not very interesting.  Quite disappointed in the set.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Luhrmann's flamboyant musical 'Moulin Rouge' is a combination of Camille, La Boh&egrave;me and Showgirls... The film swings easily between present and past, among so many wildly different moods: farce, tragedy, romance, satire, comedy and rock and roll...<br /><br />'Moulin Rouge' is an assault on the senses, a non stop visual explosion, an exotic trip, and a love story that is sure to touch your heart... It is a gloriously cinematic spectacle with opulent imagery directed with an eye for rich color, especially the color of rouge... It is also a breathtaking and poignant piece of cinema, a disco of dreams, a crazy and daring show, a vibrant screen fantasy, a \\"Bohemian Revolution,\\" a magical movie for those who love romance, pop music and old musical movies...<br /><br />Nicole Kidman gives the film its soul... She is the \\"sparkling diamond\\" of the show, the toast of Paris, the city's top courtesan... She melts her characterization with a sizzling, yet tender, performance... She is undeniably sexy, a beautiful singer, a flashy dancer whose heart sings whenever she sees Christian... In many ways, she is drawn as the ultimate sex goddess, as enigmatic as Greta Garbo, and her glamor masks her pain as well as her happiness... Kidman gives the film its central erotic charge, and its romantic thrills... She sways on a flying trapeze belting out Marilyn Monroe's \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,\\" and Madonna's \\"Material Girl.\\"<br /><br />Ewan McGregor achieves a nice mix of optimism and desperation, emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet-hero... Christian is a young idealist who moves to the bohemian section of Paris during the 'summer of love' of 1899... He is hired to write a show about 'truth, beauty, freedom and, most of all, love.' Christian battles for the body and soul of the ravishing Satine... His fundamental believe is 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to be loved in return...<br /><br />John Leguizamo is vulnerable and sweet as Henri de Toulouse Lautrec needing a good writer to come up with story and lyrics for his new show called \\"Spectacular Spectacular.\\"<br /><br />Jim Broadbent is wonderfully comic as the ringmaster Harold Zidler... He is a jovial impresario who peddles the charms of a successful Satine to a mesmerized public... He is the owner of the infamous nightclub who has promised Satine to the evil Duke of Monroth... He has his eye on her too...<br /><br />Richard Roxburgh is odious as the jealous benefactor obsessed with Satine to the point of murder... He is stunningly arrogant wanting the gorgeous can-can chanteuse in an \\"exclusive contract.\\"<br /><br />Luhrmann combines 1900 Can Can burlesque with modern musical poetry, exploiting Kidman's grace and beauty and overwhelming the audience with frenetic dance numbers delivered in operatic-style...

B0000A1RJI|5.0|Very good cd.  My son will wear it out before he finished listening to it.  Recommended buy for any Pirates fan.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I don't watch \\"Grey's Anatomy.\\" I don't follow the pop charts, I don't watch awards shows. So it wasn't until I went to see Peter O'Toole in the glorious \\"Venus\\" that I heard Corinne Bailey Rae.<br /><br />The song comes at the film's mid-point. O'Toole --- once a star, now a character actor who is mostly hired to play hospital patients or corpses --- has befriended a young working class girl. It's a \\"My Fair Lady\\" set-up, except for one thing: O'Toole's deep understanding of physical pleasure and the delight he takes in having this young flesh by his side.<br /><br />He wants to impress his \\"Venus.\\" And the next time he gets hired for a TV film, he demands a big black limousine. The limo has a sunroof. Like a high school prom queen, the girl opens it, stands on the seat and waves at the commoners as O'Toole savors her legs. Naturally, there's music. Naturally, a female singer.<br /><br />Her voice is dreamy as Rickie Lee Jones or Sade. Sexy, but not dirty. Smooth as a martini buzz, but not reckless. Not much of a band at the beginning: a jazzy bass, organ, drums. And pretty lyrics:<br /><br />Three little birds, sat on my window.<br /><br />And they told me I don't need to worry.<br /><br />Summer came like cinnamon<br /><br />So sweet,<br /><br />Little girls double-dutch on the concrete.<br /><br />Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright<br /><br />The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same<br /><br />Oh, don't you hesitate.<br /><br />And then the song kicks up a notch. Trumpets squeal, the drummer pushes, there's a backup track --- this is the chorus, and it has a modest urgency:<br /><br />Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song<br /><br />You go ahead, let your hair down<br /><br />Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,<br /><br />Just go ahead, let your hair down.<br /><br />You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.<br /><br />Well, how can you not feel joy? Who has not taken her courage --- to say nothing of her philosophy --- from a pop song? Who'd reject a dream with a happy ending?<br /><br />When the scene ended, I thought: \\"Wow, that Norah Jones really is good.\\"<br /><br />It turns out that a lot of people have been saying that about Norah Jones. That is, the next Norah Jones --- Corinne Bailey Rae. In her native England, she's blown right past James Blunt for flavor of the year: She's only the fourth female Brit to have her first album debut at number one. At the English version of the Grammys, she was voted \\"Best UK Newcomer\\" and \\"Best UK Female.\\" As I write (early January, 2007), she's up for three Grammys: \\"Record of the Year\\", \\"Song of the Year\\" (both for \\"Put Your Records On\\") and \\"Best New Artist.\\" And her CD is selling and selling and selling.<br /><br />On one level, I'm embarrassed to admit I like Corinne Bailey Rae. It's not that I'm a snob who rejects anything that's too popular (although you could probably make a case for that). It's that I'm painfully aware that a year from now --- or maybe just six months --- I might put this CD on and wonder how I went so wrong. Because Corinne Bailey Rae is not the new Billie Holiday. If she can't follow this CD with another must-listen, she may not even be the new Norah Jones. And the more you listen, the more the songs blur --- most of them seem like variations on a theme. Politics? She has none. Message? Love. Enchantment. Bittersweet intimacy. Nothing you couldn't spread with a butter knife.<br /><br />One another level, I say: Forget all that. There's something to be said for \\"pleasant.\\" And she wrote (or co-authored) every song on her CD. And she plays guitar, bass, keyboards and percussion --- it's not like she's Milli Vanilli.<br /><br />On balance: Life is hard. When we turn to music, we don't need every track to confront and challenge us. So what if this is the musical equivalent of comfort food? It works. On just about every track, it works. As you hang out, over dinner, in the bedroom, it works.<br /><br />Two-and-a-half cheers. For now, anyway./>Two-and-a-half cheers. For now, anyway.
044022165X|5.0|\\"The Rainmaker\\" is a modern-day \\"David vs. Goliath\\" story in which the reader can't help but cheer for David - Rudy Baylor, about to graduate from a nondescript law school with neither job nor money.<br /><br />Rudy accidentally attains two multi-million dollar cases within minutes of each other while staffing a free clinic as part of his coursework.  The first involves a somewhat batty elderly widow who wants to revise her will to cut out relatives who have paid her no attention, and the second is a lawsuit against a major health insurer for failing to cover a bone marrow transplant that might have saved a young man's life.<br /><br />Despite being double-crossed by a legal firm that promises Rudy a paralegal job in return for his lawsuit case (Rudy is let go before being put on the payroll). facing a judge biased towards insurance companies (dies, is replaced by another biased against them), facing a five-man legal team from a top law firm with no experience of his own, being temporarily distracted by potential arson and murder charges stemming from his first \\"employer's\\" office burning down, support staff consisting solely of \\"paralawyer\\" assistant who has given up trying to pass the bar after failing six times, and a defendant that withholds information and lies, Rudy manages to take a serious case of insurance company abuse and win a $50 million punitive award, with the part-time help of a former law school professor and a couple of other private attorneys after the same firm.  The \\"bad news\\" is that the company almost immediately declares bankruptcy, and its president is arrested for looting its assets.<br /><br />As for the \\"rich\\" widow, Rudy's assistant finds out that the fortune's almost entirely non-existent - so no money there either.

B000IOM0YM|4.0|This 2 DVD set has some good footage plus a bonus DVD of a edited concert. <br /> <br />DVD 1 - '74 - `76 <br />The very first footage is from Long Beach, CA - 1974 <br />KISS performs \\"Acrobat\\". Unfortunately the only footage they had was cut and was also a combination of 2 performances. You have silent footage from Long Beach w/ the audio from a radio broadcast in Memphis, Tennessee. But was interesting to see the beginning of KISS. <br /> <br />ABC's In Concert - 3/21/74 aired in March. <br />It's in color but not that clear. They cover 3 songs \\"Nothin To Lose\\", \\"Firehouse\\"  <br />and \\"Black Diamond\\" <br /> <br />The Mike Douglas Show - 4/29/74 <br />Includes interview w/ Gene Simmons and later the band comes out to perform \\"Firehouse\\". Now I have bootleg of this show & they cut out some of the interview. I don't know why... <br /> <br />Winterland, S.F., CA 1/31/75 <br />Black & white w/ some film distortion. They note in the DVD booklet Bill Graham's Archived 2 of the 3 Winterland shows was partly destroyed by a fire the band retained a copy of the second show. The concert wasn't bad as they played songs from their 1st 2 albums. This was the entire concert except for the encore that gets cut out. But this is classic KISS. <br /> <br />Midnight Special - 4/1/75 <br />2 songs \\"She\\" in color but \\"Black Diamond\\" was B&W. Also the quality was poor it looks as it was taped off the TV. <br /> <br />Promotion clips  <br />of ALIVE and a documentary of KISS in Cadillac, MI. <br />The doc was good as they show KISS getting the key to the city and all the towns people wearing KISS make up.  <br /> <br />Cobo Hall Detroit, MI - 1/26/76 <br />Good show and in color. This is noted in the linear notes as one of the concerts that Gene's hair catches on fire.  <br /> <br /> <br />DVD 2 '76 - `77 <br />So It Goes - 8/21/76 <br />A Granada TV show includes interviews w/ KISS in England. <br /> <br />The Paul Lynde Halloween Special - 10/29/76 <br />W/ guest Margaret Hamilton (witch on Wizard of Oz) dressed as the Witch who joins Paul Lynde in a brief comic banter w/ KISS. Then KISS performs \\"King Of The Nightime World\\". They cut out Peter Criss singing Beth....again why?  <br /> <br />Budokan Hall, Tokyo, Japan - 4/2/77 <br />This is my favorite concert from this collection. A very good concert from their Rock And Roll Over tour. This includes all the bits from blood spitting, fire-breathing to smoking guitar to levitating drum kit. <br /> <br />Don Kirshner's Rock Concert - 5/28/77 <br />3 songs all lip-synced <br /> <br />The Summit, Houston, TX - 9/2/77 <br />This show has been on VH-1 a few times another great show from the Love Gun tour. <br /> <br />BONUS DISC: <br />Different footage depending on places you buy it. <br />The one I have is from Madison Square Garden, NY, NY - 2/18/77 <br />Not the entire show but includes 7 songs from what I think this their Alive! Tour. Quality is off a bit at times but good enough to see & enjoy.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|De verdad muy bueno este DVD de KISS en donde nos muestra su epoca mas fructifera.  Tener los dos primeros Alive en video de verdad que es un lujo, aparte de las rarezas de \\"Hooligan\\", \\"Acrobat\\", entre otros.  La calidad de imagen de \\"Acrobat\\" es algo deficiente y comienza por la mitad, pero vale la pena.   <br /> <br />Lo malo es que en Don Krishner fue un Playback tanto en I Want You, Hard Luck Woman y Love Em And Leave Em.    <br /> <br />Salvo estos detalles  muy muy recomendado

B00005JPE7|5.0|Sometimes I love being wrong.  Case in point: this film.  When I first heard that Stallone intended to make it I actually laughed, and thought to myself \\"he's lost his bloody mind!\\"  I then pictured some comical scenes of an old man pounding a younger one into the mat and regaining his belt, tearing what few strands of believability that are left in the Rocky legend to shreds.    I was very, very wrong.  This movie is actually more realistic than any of the films, with the possible exception of the first.  Set in the decaying city of Philadelphia, an older, widowed Rocky runs a small restaurant called \\"Adrian's.\\"  He is haunted by memories of his glorious past, and angry at how time and age have taken both his beloved wife and his fighting prowess.    At the same time we get a good look at the gentler side of the character, as he helps a struggling single mother and her son to survive, as well as others who have fallen on hard times, including an opponent from the first film, Spider Rico.    When the opportunity for the fight with the current champion comes along, there is no illusion that he will actually defeat the much younger man.  He wishes only to go the distance, and so close the circle that began when he first fought Apollo Creed 30 years previous.  Does he do it?  I won't tell.    There are no villains in this film.  Even his ring opponent is a noble person, an athlete/warrior who is disgusted by the lack of mettle in the current crop of fighters.  He treats Rocky respectfully, albeit with a condescending \\"I'll go easy on you, pops\\" attitude.     Rocky's son and Paulie are returning characters as well.  Paulie struggles with his own demons, especially his regrets over the way he once treated his sister.  Rocky, Jr. appears as a young man living in his dad's very large shadow, as he seeks to carve out a career in the business world.    Most touching of all is Rocky's continuing devotion to his beloved Adrian.  He visits her burial site often, bringing flowers, talking to her, or just sitting quietly beside the stone memorial in the cold and snow.    The ending is most satisfying, although I would have enjoyed more resolution regarding the struggles the characters were dealing with.  Does this leave the door open for yet another sequel?  I hope not.  The film was a magnificent way to end an often far-fetched but beautifully touching story.  Very highly recommended.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought the first series. I had no idea what to expect. I'm in advertising and my days are jammed. but somehow I managed to squeeze in 43 minutes every single day because West wing is simply addictive. It's an education in strategy, wit, script writing and the behind the scene politics. After west wing, you will never watch CNN the same way again.
0064430227|5.0|This book was one of my absolute favorites as a child. I recently purchased it for my son. He's only 9 months old right now, but Harold will make a nice addition to the family library. The thing I loved about Harold was the simplicity of the story and the pictures. While Harold uses his purple crayon and his imagination, so does the reader. It's easy to see how this story as endured for 50 years.
0800196341|5.0|Anytime someone can take Shakespeare and make me not only understand it,but enjoy it to the nth degree has my vote! As much as I love film and live theatre,Shakespeare has always alluded me.I have always found The Bard hard on my ears and frustrating to follow.THANK YOU KENNETH BRANAGH!!!!I found a particularly marvellous 2 tape set of this HAMLET and had it converted to Hi-def DVD.What a marvel of a movie,with action,drama,comedy,tragedy and to boot,a cast of thousands! I never thought that I would say that this HAMLET is one of my top five favourite films of all time.The next day when I watched Tom Stoppard's ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD!,finally THAT film made all the sense in the world.If you have never been a Shakespeare fan,I can at least guarantee that KENNETH BRANAGH'S HAMLET will easily take you bounding and leaping forward toward a greater understanding and appreciation of what I have so long had difficulty.5 STARS IS SIMPLY NOT ADEQUATE!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a fan when Firefly was on TV, and really liked the movie, Serenity.  So when I spotted the complete series on DVD while Xmas shopping, I had to have it.  And I'm so glad I bought it.  Terrific performances, just the right mix of quirky and familiar in the story lines, appealing characters, smart dialogue, great romantic tension between Mal and Inara.  You just have to shake your head in disbelief that this one only lasted one season.  Let's hope there are more movies in the works.
B000LXHK22|5.0|Not only is this film charming, it is g-o-r-g-e-o-u-s! Ever frame is breathtaking. Russell Crow is utterly convincing as a modern day Cary Grant, and every bit as suave and debonair. This role is quite a departure from the rough images we've seen of him in the past. <br /> <br />I welcome (as in weak in the knees) this new side of Mr. Crowe.  <br /> <br />My husband even enjoyed this movie. We're both bewildered that it didn't have more box office appeal. Perhaps critics have too much influence on ticket sales. <br /> <br />See it for yourself. The scenery alone delights.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Modern Times does not have the consistent depth of Time out of Mind and Love and Theft, but it is nonetheless of the the 5 best Dylan CD's (nee, albums) of all time.  Most of the tracks are incredible (especially, When the deal goes down, Workingman Blues) but a couple are weak (a poor version of The Levee's Gonna Break, Someday Baby) as if he is trying a bit too hard.  Definitely a must buy for your Dylan collection.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Despite having a great cast and director, the Hulk movie is a total dud.      The main problem for me is the CGI rendition of the Hulk is cartoonish and absurd- throughout the movie, it's impossible to feel any empathy (like King Kong) for the titular character!  They really should have cast a human being (with some CGI) like the TV show (or hired the F/X team that did the Lord of Rings).    The second major problem is a very weak script that may be mostly Ang Lee's fault.  The father-son conflict (at the heart of the movie) was poorly conceived and the storyline is very weak and boring.  This movie really makes me appreciate the Incredible Hulk pilot from 1977, which starred Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno.  I'd have much preferred seeing a remake of that then this ill-advised, expensive flop.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|Mildly entertaining, yet good enough to watch it to the end.<br /><br />And the ending leave enough room for a sequel or will it be a new tv series ?.<br /><br /> Looks like the movie was made for good looking people as the<br /><br />guys and girls in this movie all look good and rich... Movie started with<br /><br />a rock soundtrack...yuck.. and is pretty well directed with some great<br /><br />location shots. Save your money...rent it.
0618477942|5.0|This is a carefully crafted story, beautifully integrated with literary classics, full of not-so-much surprises as confirmations in the story line. The graphics are both charming and somehow creepy--for instance, the father constantly in cut-off, short, short jeans. The memoir unfolds smoothly and without contradiction. I couldn't put this book down. Finally a graphic novel with a story of great and thoughtful depth.
B00005JPAJ|4.0|According to Wikipedia, \\"The Babel fish is a fictional species of fish in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, that can instantly translate any language to any other language.\\"  I mention this because it seems relevant to the polyglot, multicultural, and braided nature of Babel, the movie.<br /><br />In Babel, a donated rifle affects events in four countries on three continents.  There are characters mourning over deaths, and deaths to be mourned.<br /><br />If I may continue to borrow from Wikipedia, and as other reviewers have noted about the \\"Butterfly Effect,\\" \\"The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the atmosphere that ultimately cause a tornado to appear (or, for that matter, prevent a tornado from appearing). The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different.\\"<br /><br />Babel is about the start of a small change in initial conditions.  The movie doesn't end with any resulting tornado.  Instead, it hints at additional effects further along in time, effects on individuals, families, communities, and even nations.<br /><br />I thought village life in Morocco was misrepresented, in that the screenwriter portrayed Moroccans as ignorant, uncaring peasants.  Village life certainly isn't the same as life in Rabat or Casablanca, but remember that Morocco has been a country longer than the U.S.; in fact, Morocco was the first country to recognize that new upstart country, the original 13 colonies calling themselves the United States.  I doubt that the Moroccan government would be that cavalier toward an attack on a tourist bus.<br /><br />I still enjoyed the movie, and it seemed particularly appropriate on a theater-sized screen.  If you can, see Babel at your local art cinema.
B000GTLQXU|5.0|Ok, first off, anyone who compares this movie to the original classic is, in my opinion, a total moron. The ONLY similarities the two movies share is the name of the ship and the fact that they both get toppled over by a giant wave. But that's where the similarities end. You cannot even call this a remake, because the story lines are world's apart. This 2006 original \\"re-telling\\" of a ship in distress is remarkable. Josh Lucas is the hot, hunky and perfect \\"reluctant\\" hero, and we follow his story as he tries his best to save the lives of the few survivors that had the guts and instinct to move upward through the ship. The special effects are dazzling and frightening, the characters are all loveable and easy to identify with, and the direction is superb. If you're looking for a great \\"thrill-ride\\" popcorn movie, Poseidon will not dissappoint. In fact, I've seen it now 8 times, and I still love it.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Disk 1, track 10. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br />Ok, so maybe not quite enough. But that one track, \\"The Passing of the Elves\\" (aka the Elvish Lament) makes the steep price and long wait entirely worth it. That and track 5, \\"Flaming Red Hair\\", are the highlights of this set, and they're not even by Howard Shore.  <br /> <br />Now to survive until the Return of the King complete recordings come out...
B000E1155E|1.0|So, I sat down to an easy night of musical enjoyment.  I took off all of my clothes, opened a can of Jiffy, covered myself in peanut butter and then wrapped myself in saran wrap.  Poured a nice glass of white cooking wine and turned on the tunes.  First up, Arctic Monkeys.  Wow, I was appalled and ashamed.  These songs, besides all sounding alike, sound like they're written and performed by a group of hooligans who can't strum their wee wees.  As an appreciator of the finer things in life, I cannot be amused by the antics of a bunch of fraternity rejects attempting to amaze the music industry.  This was just sick, disgusting, and absolutely revolting to listen to; not to mention annoying.  My night was ruined.

B00005JLPK|4.0|Entertaining and educational. Incredible story of artist from childhood to death. Well crafted camera work and production with lots of eye candy and enjoyable music. There were some noticeable pixel distortions a couple of times in the film but nothing too distracting. <br />I do not care for communism and socialist parties but I still enjoyed this movie and watched it three times.
0716703440|4.0|Still very useful as a reference, but frustrating for beginners, because the book is far too verbose and assumes a certain mindset. Researchers will appreciate the parallel use of physical and mathematical notation, but it is doubtful if a reader mainly interested in the classical results will benefit from the latter. In short, MTW is good for in-depth treatment and competence, but to get started, the book by d'Inverno would be a far better choice. Also, for the price you should get a properly bound book...
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Well Mrs. Stefani has done it again, surprised us all.. But to my surprise it seems she is reverting back into her childhood. I feel when I listen to Sweet Escape I feel as if I am back in junior high.. I thought as we age so do the things we do and it seems the opposite for Gwen. I have been a huge fan of No Doubt since the very beginning and I thought her solo career would be great for her and her fans.. But I am saddened when I see the greatest band ever No Doubt evolve and grasp their audience over time and Gwen who ages (mid 30's & a Mom) is writing her music for the teens. Leave that to people like JoJo (but then again even she matures with age) and ect. On this cd I found the only decent tracks were the ones produced by Nellee Hooper, which sound like they could be Gwen all the rest just sound to childish for my taste. She seems to also lately be thanking all these other people who have been their for her, yet what happened to the fans that have stuck by her. Anyhow I agree with all the 1 star ratings on this site and am sad to say I will not purchase another Gwen solo album.. Please Gwen if you have people that read this go back to your roots and what made people love you so much which is NO DOUBT.
B000I5X80G|4.0|I bought this cd for only two live songs.  You guess which ones!  (Hint: Neither were on the rippin' Live Rust.) <br /> <br />What did we not really get on otherwise awesome 4-Way Street?  No long version of Down By The River!  On that previous release DBTR was melodically blended with The Loner and Cinnamon Girl, but altogether barely longer than the studio version.  Here, you get Down By The River, which rocks for a mesmerizing 12:25.  Also, it ends clean on the cd cutoff for track 3. <br /> <br />For anyone who is troubled by a song which seems to promote murdering a lover, here's a secret:  What he means by \\"...shot her dead...\\" is a certain intimate act, early in the chonology of her adult life. <br /> <br />The second classic was on 4-Way Street, as a measly less-than-4-minute version, even when the place was at their command!  You get one guess.  Here, you get about 15 minutes of Cowgirl In The Sand!  As far as I know, the only other live release of this captivating classic is on Road Rock, there at about 18 minutes.   <br /> <br />For some reason (maybe living out the line of \\"...better to burn out\\"), the editor of Road Rock and this Fillmore version let this song \\"fade away\\" with over a minute of totally unnecessary applause and clatter at the end.  They did this on Weld too, with Like A Hurricane.  On this cd, we suffer through a full minute of varying levels of crowd clapping, then about 10 seconds of the beginning of the next song, and the cd ends.  Hey, when I said mesmerizing, I didn't mean that the editor should fall asleep at the knobs.  What more appropriate time to say, \\"cut the crap.\\"   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, these two songs rock! <br /> <br />Since these editors need to be shaken to wake up, I'll steer some buyers to a parallel universe.  Check out the tribute double cd of This Note's For You Too.  It has 37 Neil Young songs, and many are better than the redman's.
B000002I2G|2.0|....you have THE SOFT PARADE, by the Doors.<br /><br />The title piece, \\"The Soft Parade,\\" is truly one of the silliest things ever committed to vinyl. With words like: \\"Peppermint miniskirts, chocolate candy-- Champion sax and a gur-ull named Sandy,\\" the myth of Jim Morrison's supposedly brilliant lyric-writing abilities was laid to rest for all time. You can almost hear Morrison's drunken hiccups during his ad-libbed \\"This is the trip\\" nonsense on what is an overlong, wincingly putrid musical montage.<br /><br />His physical damage from drug and alcohol overconsumption and rapid decline were never more apparent than on the vocals for \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"Tell All The People.\\" The man's lack of sobriety on the first and unsteady weakness on the second are almost painful to experience. \\"Wishful Sinful\\" and \\"Wild Child\\" are more of the same.<br /><br />The only standouts on this one are \\"Easy Ride\\" and \\"Runnin' Blue.\\" My guess is Jim was sober for those sessions. The rest here is totally forgettable. If you must own all the Doors albums, buy THE SOFT PARADE last. Its that poor, and that sad. Probably should have been called THE SAD PARADE.
B0007TKNIS|2.0|After all the hype I heard about this movie I finally watched  it and was severly disappointed.  Some of the music is watered down and the actors leave much to be desired (in singing and acting).   <br />     If you want a good audio recording of this I recommend  the \\"The Phantom of the Opera (Original 1986 London Cast)\\" CD.  It leaves out some story but still leaves you satisfied.  Also the singers are much better than in the movie.  However, if you can't sit still for about an hour and just listen to a CD of this great performance, I guess you'll just have to settle for the poorer performance given in the movie.

B000IHY9SE|3.0|I'm glad I borrowed this before buying because I really would have felt it to be a waste of money. I understand this album is supposed to be getting the other groups names out there, but personally, when I'm in a mood for Eminem, I want to hear Eminem. Not the people he is trying to promote.<br /><br />Some of the songs are good, but it is NOT what I expected from Eminem. Personally, I didn't mind his crude, in-your-face lyrics that were present in previous albums.

0385474547|5.0|\\"He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.\\" <br /> <br />An enthralling novel of European colonialism from an African perspective, \\"Things Fall Apart\\" tells the story of the impending imperialism imposed on African tribes from the perspective of an Igbo warrior, Okonkwo, and his family.  The Nigerian author, Achebe, uses simple yet descriptive language to paint his story of life in an African tribe at the onset of colonialism.  Written as a foil to Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" this novel presents the native tribal people in an entirely different light.  Achebe succeeds in showing the native Igbo tribe, not as bloodthirsty savages, but as a noble people whose ultimate goal is a peaceful and harmonious community.  <br /> <br />The epitome of the noble warrior, Okonkwo clings fiercely to the traditions of his ancestors.  Being the son of an &lt;efulefu> (worthless man), Okonkwo works tirelessly to achieve his high status among his clansmen.  He values hard work and despises all things associated with weakness or laziness, for his biggest fear is to end up as his father.  Yet, his indomitable drive to succeed manifests in a violent temper and a malevolence toward all things feminine, for any weak man he considers an &lt;agbala> (woman).  His chauvinistic and misogynistic nature leads to conflict within his family, especially toward his eldest son, Nwoye. <br /> <br />Achebe succeeds in painting a poignant picture of the tribal people as they come to terms with the new colonialists.  At first, the Europeans arrive as missionaries with a benevolent cause.  Indeed, the Christian missionaries are initially presented in a positive light, as the Reverend Brown practices restraint and respect for the native religions as he implores them to become educated, lest they become objects of oppression by the oncoming onslaught of foreigners.  However, his successors are more radical and their contempt and arrogance toward the natives causes much tension.  The colonialists, too, are presented in a balanced manner, as not all tribesman are aghast at this invasion of foreigners.  However, despite their advances in medicine and their pretext of helping the natives, the new wave of colonialists attempt to impose their European laws and customs upon the natives as they attempt to achieve their goal of \\"pacification of the primitive tribes.\\" <br /> <br />Undoubtedly, the most important thread that ties all various tribes together is the reverence for ancestors and the kinship amongst the peoples.  The relationships between family and the elders is of utmost importance, as the breaking of these bonds is sacrilegious.  Although the missionaries may have good intentions, it is Christianity more than the armed colonial soldiers that inflicts the most damage upon their way of life.  For Christians, the bond between one's self and God, as the Father, is the most important, as believers are \\"brothers in Christ.\\"  Yet, for the Igbo, if one is to become a Christian, then one must break the kinship bonds and reject the beliefs of the ancestors.  Christianity is the \\"knife\\" that cuts these bonds and causes their traditional society to \\"fall apart.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, Achebe succeeds in showing the aspects and beliefs of the Igbo in a sympathetic, yet realistic nature.  Although some traditions are barbaric by any reasonable standard, such as leaving newborn twins in the forest to die, Achebe succeeds in dispelling the common myth of the natives as ruthless savages that must be tamed, like wild animals.  This is an enlightening novel and was a delight to read.

This band has something to say &  an irresistible voice with which to shout it to the world.  Even if you don't normally listen to \\"message\\" music, buy it & listen.  You can't help but be drawn in.  This band hits you in the gut.
B000J103PC|2.0|This movie has great acting and a bad script. The book was so much better.  The movie is watered down to almost nothing.  It should have been much better.  Read the book for a fun time.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|Probably you already know the film's plot, so I won't repeat it again. Horror film fans know that there are a set of basic rules in the genre, and you will see `Hostel' is following them faithfully. That means, three backpackers, booze, women and some remote place no one has heard about before. There is nothing new or inventive about the premise, but it is only a starting point for the entire film, so that is alright with me. <br /> <br />The most disappointing thing about `Hostel' for me is, however, that the film is not scary very much. The film seldom builds up the tension or the chills before the terrifying events that happen to each character. Things are set up in by-the-number way, never letting us imagine what is really going on in this quiet village in Slovakia. <br /> <br />Instead, like his previous film `Cabin Fever' director Eli Roth shows lots of gores and tortures that are dreadful to see, and he is surely good at that. But if you ask me if there is something else that is particularly great about the film, I must say I could find none. The political subtext is cursory, and dark humor only falls flat.  <br /> <br />The film is \\"presented\\" by Quentin Tarantino who must have found something great in this film, but frankly I don't know what part of this film he liked so much as to give his name to it. But this is not the first time; anyone remembering the 1996 film `Curdled' (for which Tarantino served as executive producer) knows what I mean.  <br /> <br />One interesting thing is that Takashi Miike appears as cameo, an enigmatic businessman warning the protagonist Jay Fernandez to `be careful.' Perhaps this prolific director from Japan could have done a much better job, judging from his works like `Audition.' `Hostel' is after all not a terrible film. It is only passable, having nothing truly scary in it except,  you know, its gruesome torture.
0786890754|4.0|I have passed this book so many times on a shelf it's ridiculous!  The american cover to this book, just didn't attract me enough to want to read it. However, after reading ahern's 3rd book, which i recieved as a gift, my mum went out and bought me P.S. I LOVE YOU and WHERE RAINBOWS END. I finished P.S. I LOVE YOU in less than a day, I couldn't put it down. I loved the premise of this book. Holly and Gerry are childhood sweethearts, best friends and soul mates who are perfect for eachother. When Gerry dies from a brain tumor, Holly has to figure out how to go on living without her other half. Even with the love and help from her family and friends, Holly just doesn't know how to pick herself up, until she recieves a message from Gerry. A package arrives with a letter and 10 envelopes inside. Gerry has written \\"the list\\" for Holly to help her get through the rest of the year without him. (I thought this was a beautifully fresh approach to recovering from losing a loved one). So we are taken along for a ride with Holly as she tries to get through 10 months of grieving, love, laughter, anger and bitterness.  <br />Ahern's writing is alittle rough and akward, however her characters are very colourful and come to life easily. I wasn't surprised to learn that this has been picked up and turned into a film. I absolutely adore Gerard Butler and I can picture him as Gerry, however the rest of the cast left a sour tatse in my mouth. Why chose so many americans to play such witty IRISH characters! It will be interesting to see how faithful to the book they remain. <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a light and easy read.
1582701709|5.0|In the book, the author does indeed interfere with the presentation by giving us personal anecdotes (sic?) which sometimes negatively resonate her world view of multiple subjects (money, relationships, weight, etc). On the other hand, her commentary helps to tie the testimonials into a coherent progression.  The DVD for example is less successful, partially because in restraining her commentary--warts and all--the movie's narrative is considerably weakened. Ultimately I see there's no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater: if anyone needs to separate the spurious from the truthful, one only needs to balance her opinions with the work of Lynne Mctaggart, Raymond Holliwell, Abraham-Hicks and Wayne Dyer. Therefore I confidently leave the 5 star rating intact.   <br /> <br />Here's another thought:  I recall in the book's preface that Secret film team managed to record HUNDREDS of hours of interview testimonials to make the 90-minute DVD.  Will we view them in a future edition, i.e., What the Bleep's Rabbit Hole edition?  I would hope so: that I would buy.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|I've always Dug Elvis Presley.  this is a Great Introduction collection a Double set that is on point. Suspicious Minds is My Favorite Presley song to this day.  these Songs still hold up so well&Elvis's voice is the main reason. he left a distinctive impression with how he presented his take on songs. i already have Elvis collections,but this One is a very Good. a Must have.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|An excellent portrayal of the social period that controlled our parents  or Grandparents lives and thereby shaped that of todays baby boomers. Essential watching for those who want an entertaining education. <br /> <br />Well acted and period perfect. The extras 'Especially what women wanted'.  <br /> <br />Ultimately the film fails in what it is seeking to portray. It seems to run out of time. Julia Roberts is a delightful actress but not the right one for the leading part in this film. She is to nice, sugar and spice.  <br /> <br />just Jack <br />
B000BTGY1O|5.0|This film is fantastic! It is romantic yet quite funny. It may seem dated, but I am in my twenties and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000067DNC|3.0|good, very good, but, I was looking for a version with a translation to spanish. You never said something about it in the review.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|\\"A Good Year\\" deals with the story of Max (Crowe), a heartless guy who doesn't \\"do weekends\\" and has \\"questionable\\" work ethics (you could say), who goes back to France to his recently deceased uncle's vineyards in Provence in order to sell the property.  Of course the movie is completely predictable : he falls in love with the local georgeous girl (Marion Cotillard) and he changes back into this guy who loves life and is nice and all of that good stuff.  But don't hold that against the movie, because you'd then be missing out on a really good one.    The movie's been described as \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" with a male lead, and I guess that's somewhat accurate but at the same time not really.  It does play the same stories what with getting situated in a beautiful environment, but the two lead characters in both movies are very different from one another.  Diane Lane's character just wanted to get away whereas Crowe's just wants to go back so it's not exactly the same situation.  A lot of people criticize the fact that it's not Crowe's or Ridley Scott's best, and sometimes go to say it's their worst movie ever made.  I personally don't see it.  Coming into this movie you can't be waiting for something like \\"The Gladiator\\" because if that's the case you're in for 2 hours of boredom.  So ok, it's not the best movie ever made, but it's not one of the worst either.  Personally I'd say it's still above average, and considering some of the movies that have been coming out, it's almost like a little piece of paradise.  The movie takes its time getting to where it wants to go, taking the time to take in all the scenery and the people and just the whole charm of the environment we've been put in.  The acting is fine.  It's not Russell Crowe's best but it's not horrendous either and he's just fine in the role he's playing, even if I had a tough time warming up to the character (but isn't that the point?).  I'm a huge fan of Marion Cotillard so i'm biased but I thought she was great in the movie.  The rest of the cast does really well too even though the neighbor had a tendency to get on my nerves.    On the whole, I thought it was a good movie, I really enjoyed it.  It's a nice break from action and political movies, and there's a couple of times where you can't help but laugh (the reference to Lance Armstrong, for example).  It's a movie that takes its time but I wasn't bored once, it still has momentum. But if you weren't a fan of \\"Under The Tuscan Sun\\", then beware because you won't be a fan of this one.
B000001FN3|4.0|I love this album.  I'm one of the relative few who bought it when it first came out in 1976.  But they really shouldn't have messed with it when they decided to release a remastered version.  Yes, I love the Orson Welles narration that they added, but the new guitar parts really annoy me.  For anyone who listened endlessly to the original LP, the new guitar parts sound very 80's and stand out in a bad way.  I wish people would learn to leave well enough alone.  Other than the cheesy guitar parts (and the final, totally boring, song), it's a classic album.  It's too bad APP went commercial on their next LP, but it happens to the best of them.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|Absolutely fabulous album (although the elevator doors of my special edition get a little stuck).<br /><br />I'm sharing my copy with just enough people to make them want to buy their own.
B00005JPE7|4.0|There is no such thing as a \\"has been\\" when it comes to Rocky.  This movie was sentimental and very sad at times, and seeing him struggle with the loss of his beloved Adriane really tugged at the heartstrings.  The dialoge was REAL, filled with emotion as he tries to toughen up his son in the hard knocks that life can throw.  Through some flashbacks, we get to see Mickey (the late Burgess Meredith) and Adriane (Talia Shire) and this brought back some wonderful memories of the original ROCKY.  Though some reviewers thought the flashbacks were annoying, I actually felt they added to the film's sense of reminiscing since Rocky spends so much of his time trying to get a grip on the past and who he has become today.  Spending much of his time with his brother-in-law, Paulie (Burt Young) and adopting a shelter dog named Punchie, Rocky is such a lonely soul now, and you can't help but hope that he finds love again (with Little Marie) and can somehow put closure on his boxing career with this final exhibition fight.  Though being matched with heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (real life boxer, Antonio Tarver) is a bit unbelievable, it provided for some good Underdog cheering, and the inclusion of the ringside announcers from HBO's PPV line up added to the authentic feel of the fight.  I found myself really appreciating many of the lines in this film, especially when Rocky tells his son that, \\"Somewhere along the line...you let other people tell you you're no good...if you know what you're worth, then go out and GET what you're worth...be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you're not where you want to be because of \\"him\\" or \\"her\\" or anybody.\\"  Good advice for anyone, especially in today's world where so many feel they're just never good enough, and find a way to lay blame everywhere but on themselves.  Very inspiring and uplifting, and happy to see it with young kids since there was no profanity whatsoever.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I bought this movie so I could play it on my PS3 and I was blown away at how good it looks! I remember seeing this movie when I was little on my recorded straight from TV VHS tape, and playing it over and over again until the tape wore out. I watched again over the weekend on blueray and I was amazed at the clarity of the transfer, the saturation of the colors and the punch of the soundtrack.  <br /> <br />You do have to be aware of one thing though. If you are playing blueray movies using your Playstation 3, and do not have an HD TV with an input capable of taking in a 1080i signal (at least), the playstation will send a 480p signal instead of downconverting to 720p. That is because all bluerays are native 1080p, and the playstation seems incapable of downcoverting the signal (for now) to 720p. <br /> <br />I have a Samsung DLP TV, and its true native resolution is 720p, therefore i told my PS3 to always send a 720p signal to my TV. Well, when I played Terminator instead of sending a high def signal to my TV, it sent a 480p signal, making the quality of the movie no better than DVD. I was confused and thought the blueray looked crappy, but it reality it was the signal that was crappy. I told my PS3 to send a 1080i signal, and this time the blueray finally came to life. Even though my TV is native 720p resolution, it is capable to taking a 1080i signal and showing it.  <br /> <br />Anyway, just wanted to make that point clear, since some people complain the movie doesnt look any better than a DVD, but it really does... if you have your configuration right.

1582701709|5.0|I've watched the DVD twice and both times wished I had taken notes. Now you don't have to!  The book is a great companion to the DVD.  I feel I got the most from watching the DVD first and was thrilled to get a copy of the book.  I have read a great many books on \\"changing your life\\".  To me The Secret has made the most sense and is the easiest to apply to your life.  Does is take a little work?  Sure, but it does make sense and it does work!
B000I5X81K|4.0|Today, it is very important to understand and listen to all types of music. This is one! I liked this CD because this person trys to give you different kinds of classical and pop music. Maybe when a person hears this music they will listen to other groups and people singing and playing from different ranges in music.

B000I0QK74|4.0|Ok, I grew up with James and played all his songs, he isnpired me in many ways to play good guitar and to pick the strings instead of using a pick. His voice is still \\"sweet\\", but maybe a bit too sweet? You will defintely have to like Christmas and James to want to listen to this number too many times. His version of Joni Mitchell's River is the best, the rest are just filler material for the background music during Christmas dinner. When will we get a real new James Taylor album????

It has that silly comedy that is sometimes so dumb you just have to laugh and for the person who loves to laugh, this is perfect for them.  There is even a Moscow one that I did not know existed.  This set is just great.
B0009MWEMQ|4.0|Ok, If you are a die hard original RE fan you should really go see this movie.. Although it does not stick to the original story line as in the Playstation version of the game, It does however touch on some of the events.  I rated it 4 stars only because I thought If they actually sticked with the original story, they would have made for a really good movie.  You know.. Creeping around an old Mansion and finding trap doors and having zombies fly out at you.. Im so addicted to the original game.. that it is somewhat sad.. The game just rocks..  <br />  Anyways, getting back to the movie, if you love zombie movies and played alot of Resident Evil.. this is a must see... It's definetly filled with action and gives you more of an idea on how the T-VIRUS came about, and how evil the Umbrella Corporation can be.

0736063684|5.0|I've been using the book to help with my weight training and it's been a great resource. The book has different levels based on your ability. The illustrations are great because they show all the muscle groups affected by each movement. I've been able to focus on specific body parts that are really weak to build muscle and strength. I've been very  happy with this book.

0618001905|4.0|The book is well written, really lets you understand the sequence of events that surrounded both the colonization of the Congo and the efforts of the many people who had worked against the regime. One of the most shocking revelations of the book is that this wasn't an isolated freakish series of events, but that the same kind of horrors were to be found elsewhere in colonial Africa, perhaps to a lesser degree, but that the Congo was simply the most publicized and well-known of them. The fact that it's almost put in as an afterthought is the one flaw of the book, but I don't think it could have the same pacing and sense of narrative if it were a real survey of 19th C colonization in Africa. It's a reminder that we need to be paranoid about people claiming good intentions for reforming a supposedly \\"backwards\\" place.

It was a choice piece of work with language that flowed and was easily understood.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|Warren Beatty has made a beautiful, epic film about the times leading up to and just after the Russian Revolution, tracing the life of John Reid, who wrote \\"Ten Days That Shook The World\\", and his involvement in left wing journalism and politics in the US and then in the fledgling USSR. Great performances by Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton are highlights. This film held our interest for its entire 3+ hour length. I have looked forward to the release of this film on DVD for a long time, having had a strong memory of its original theatrical release. A must for any serious film-lover's collection.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is one of my favorite directors. Anime has been very important to me since I was in my teens. The first time I saw Nausicaa it was a lame US dub, edited to the point of butchery and yet I held on to my copy of that film for ever. Even in that horrible state it was amazing to watch. Eventually I got the real japanese version on EBAY even before it was released domestically. I watched it at least 100 times. It's one of the few films I never seem to tire of. laputia by Hayao Miyazaki is also way up there alongside this film. All his films are so great. Still Nausicaa is my favorite. It has a great story, amazing characters, fantastic landscapes and creatures, wonderful music, and is beautifully animated. I have since tracked down the CD score, as well as an amazing book, The Art of Nausicaa.<br /><br />The New US release is dubbed well and is a must own. It comes with many extras any fan of this film will want.<br /><br />I love this film and I recommend it, and any Hayao Miyazaki film to anyone who enjoys good films, as well as top notch animation.

0307346609|4.0|The best way to describe World War Z by Max Brooks is with the oxymoronic term fictional history. This is not to be confused with the much more common literary genre of historical fiction, wherein an author sets a fictional story within a real-life historical framework. Fictional history, as used by Brooks, is just the opposite: setting a historical story within a fictional framework. In other words, what Brooks has done is tell the story of a historical event that never happened.<br /><br />Confused? So was I when I first picked up the book.<br /><br />The book is subtitled, \\"An Oral History of the Zombie War.\\" It's a collection of short-story-like first-person accounts of how various groups and individuals all over the world experienced varying degrees of success in combating the vast forces of zombies that threatened to overtake mankind before, during, and after the Great Panic.<br /><br />Stay with me. This is not Dawn of the Dead or Revenge of the Killer Zombies or anything quite so ridiculous. Though this really is a book about zombies, it's not in any way a silly book. Nor, for that matter, is it a horror book. What it is is a fascinating account of a war that never happened, told in a gritty, realistic manner by people who never lived. It's sort of a postmodern zombie equivalent of I Am Legend, the 1960s non-horror vampire tale by Richard Matheson.<br /><br />World War Z is interesting and compelling and horrifying and heartwarming all at once. I would characterize it as being extremely well written, insofar as each of the three-to-four-page first-person accounts are told with a unique voice. Very often, items in a single-author short-story collection tend to run together and become almost indistinguishable from each other because all the stories, being written by the same author, have the same general voice. They all feel sort of the same, even though the subjects are different. That's not the case with this book. Brooks was able to infuse different motivations, emotions, disappointments, and struggles into each different narrator with the end result being a real sense of collaboration rather than simple narration.<br /><br />Brooks's sense of how the world would respond to an existence-threatening crisis is fascinating as well. Predictably, and probably accurately, the U.S. responds with collaborative military force. China responds by shutting down the flow of all incoming and outgoing information. Russia responds by returning to its Orthodox religious roots. Britain and Israel respond pragmatically, looking after their own citizens at the expense of all others. Discussions of political and military strategies, detailed examinations of the strengths and weaknesses of various weapons systems, and realistic military-sounding jargon and nicknames for the undead enemy add realism and a sense that events really could play out this way were the dead to rise.<br /><br />Brooks's zombies follow the \\"rules\\" set forth by generations of Hollywood zombie stereotypes: they moan, shuffle, have a contagious bite, and can be dispatched only by a direct shot to the brain. In World War Z, it's the human response that prove unpredictable. Brooks serves as a kind of tour guide through the first governmental reactions to rumors of zombies walking the earth, through the earliest inadequate responses, through the attempted cover-ups, through the mass population migrations, through the initial (and ultimately flawed) military response, through the turning of the tide, and finally through the cleanup and recovery efforts. Through it all, he provides a contemplative mood that ultimately comments on the indefatigable nature of the human spirit.<br /><br />Readers should exercise caution in approaching this book. Gruesome descriptions and violent scenes abound, as does a fair amount of casual cursing. Overall, however, the book is surprisingly inoffensive and actually provides a fair amount of thoughtful entertainment. World War Z is sure to join Brooks's first book, The Zombie Survival Guide, as a cult classic, but it's good enough to cross over into the realm of regular readers as well. Recommended for the adventurous and strong of stomach.is sure to join Brooks's first book, The Zombie Survival Guide, as a cult classic, but it's good enough to cross over into the realm of regular readers as well.

His relaxed, comfortable presentation does not mask his high intelligence and detailed knowledge of the subjects he discusses.

0618680004|4.0|I loved this book for its method of breaking down the religious argument. <br />I find no flaw with most of Dawkins logic, however he seems to overlook the idea that his Atheism is just as presumptous in drawing conclusions about the nature of/existence of any supreme being/prime mover as any religion. <br />He alsos glosses over agnosticism, which is really the only scientific view to take on these subjects, as there reamains no evidence either way. <br />Other than the above grievances, I did love Dawkins use of probability to shut down the \\"god\\" myth. Very fun!

B00005JPE7|5.0|I went to see this movie with a \\"show me\\" attitude.  Having seen all the Rocky movies I was certain that Sylvester Stallone was to old to cut the mustard.  Needless to say I left with the an entirely different feeling.  Rocky Balboa has not lost any exciting moves.  The movie was a true Rocky fast moving hard punching drama.  Yes, I was waiting for the theme song and Rocky to fly up those Philadelphia stairs.  Not disappointed in any aspects of this movie.  It was real, it was captivating, it was ROCKY at his best.

For the first time ever I baked myself a birthday cake and as fabulous as it looked in the book, it was even better in person. <br /> <br />To the person who wrote about the ingredients and not knowing where to get them, my copy of the book has a supplier list at the back, maybe yours does too. <br /> <br />This book was worth every penny (even when converted to Australian dollars).

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|This is one of those movies where watching the trailer and reading all the detailed reviews will ruin it. There are twists and turns and true enjoyment to be found watching this film without knowing where it will take you.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful- Ed Norton as always is brilliant and Paul Giamatti almost steals the show. While it was somewhat hard to believe Jessica Biel in her role, she had an ok performance. This is a rare gem of a film, and is definitely worth much more hype than it received.

B000J103PC|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie and it was a complete disappointment. It depicted the disgusting-ness of the fashion world and Anne Hathaway's character's change from a grounded, intelligent, beautiful girl into a fashion obsessed, shallow, ugly, pathetic caricature (much like those girls we see in the tabloid magazines). Meryl Streep had a great performance (she allegedly played Anna Wintour to a tee)- its just too hard to find fault with one of the finest American actresses. However, despite her performance, the movie was just too predictable, empty and disappointingly cheesy.
1878424114|5.0|This book is to the point and a fast read -- great for people who do not like to read or who do not want to read a 400-page book just to get a few key concepts.  Each chapter is short and reveals a different concept (spiritual law) in a very concise and clear way.  I read a chapter a night (20 minutes) and was finished in a week.  By the end of the book, I felt incredibly \\"centered\\" and stopped taking things (negative people or attitudes) personally.  I became more positive and had coping skills to let negativity roll off me. I wrote down the laws and posted them at my work desk.  When I start to get frustrated, I look at the list and it reminds me of what really matters.  It has given me hope that I control my life and am not at the mercy of others.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Although Al Gore apparently exaggerated some parts of the film/documentary, it is still pretty factually reliable and scary beyond words. <br /> <br />I was very reluctant to see this film as I figured it would be boring, too didactic, and that its sole purpose was to make him look good for political gain. However, it is clear that this is an even bigger issue/problem than we've been lead to believe and its implications are staggering. I was impressed with Al Gore's level of commitment to the issue and to educating the public about their impact on the environment and the \\"truth\\" about Global Warming.  <br /> <br />Regardless of your political views, this is one film everyone should see....at the very least it sparks poignant discussion;  at best, it can bring about change.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is a great movie for everyone.  A little long for toddlers to sit through, but they really enjoy most of it!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A DVD for everyone! Young and old. We must wake up to what is happening on our planet. Al Gore spells it out in a way that is easily understood and not overwhelming.  And at the same time a very serious message.  Watch it and pass it on.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|What would you expect from a band who hasn't put out an album in four decades and have lost two members to the after-life? I expected very little in the way of progress, and boy was I wrong. George Martin, arguably the fifth beatle, cements his role as a creative element of the Beatles with this album. It is not only unlike the previous released songs that show up again here, but just like the Beatles would put out in this day and age. Everybody who ever enjoyed a Beatles song should give this a listen, at least once over. It will far exceed your expectations!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I don't get it. John Mayer claims that his brilliant \\"Continuum\\" in addition to \\"Heavier Things\\" and \\"Room For Squares\\" (the best of the three, in my opinion) is actually a trilogy - but other than the fact that they're all incredible, highly listenable discs by the same amazing talent, I don't see the connection. What I do see is how much growth has taken place from one disc to the next, particularly with this one. John Mayer has taken us from catchy alternative to sultry blues and from smooth jazz to sweet romance, all with the depth of a thinker's lyrics... and that's not counting his dive into country with Brad Paisley or his covers of classic rock tunes. All I can say is I can't wait to see what he does next!

1582701709|5.0|This book is exactly what I hoped it would be! I saw the movie, which was chock full of amazing tidbits of information, and wished I could have it in written form. This book has all that information and more, and is barely bigger than the DVD - perfect for traveling with. I like books that I can take along and refer to in odd moments of time without worrying about where I left off last. Those of you who haven't seen the movie might want to watch it first. All by itself the book is great, but it might not grab you as quickly as seeing the movie and hearing the various speakers.
0156027321|4.0|This is a well-written book that effectively uses humor and metaphors. I rated this with 4 stars only because it was well written and people who enjoy reading gory details might appreciate reading this.  <br /> <br />I read this book as a reading assignment for our book club.  I do not recommend this book to other women like myself since it contained gruesome, graphic details on animals getting ripped to shreds.  Since I love animals--all kinds--I found this difficult to read, but I still read the entire book in time for our book club discussion.   <br /> <br />However, I liked the character Pi and enjoyed the author's sense of humor.  I had to find out how Pi was rescued. <br /> <br />
0060512806|2.0|I got this for Christmas and finished it late last night.     As the tale begins, the author initiates two primary storylines, The first is set in WWII spanning both the European and Pacific theatres. The second is modern day and is centered on a California start-up (with requisite ambitious young guys) with primary business interests in the far east. One knows the stories are connected because of similar last names in both. The other connection is encryption - how crytography was central to the war and how it is central to current day business and, in the author's view, central to the future of civilization.    One of the great pluses of the book is how the author made use of these commonalities between WW2 and modern-day to create interest and anticipation. The middle of the book actually made use of these quite well and I was eager to keep reading. There is some terrific writing in middle sections and descriptions of people and places both in Europe and the Far East are very vivid.    The author does write with terrific humour at times and I was reminded in several places about a series of books written about WWI called \\"The Bandy Papers - the Journals of Bartholomew Bandy\\" by Donald Jack. Very similar in style as the author captures the points of view - dry wit - of Grandpa (WW2) and grandson (techno geek) Waterhouse.    The presentation of Gen. Douglas McArthur was (from my Canadian perpective) endearingly flag-waving-pipe-chomping-bullet- shedding-American-Super-hero and, of course, totally unbelievable.    Then I hit the final pages where I had hoped to receive a big-payoff to the build-up over the previous thousand pages. Alas, it was not to be and all the tedious verbiage that scarred the entire book turned out to be a sad bell-weather.    One of the \\"1 star\\" reviews amongst these reviews suggested that Tolkien was nothing compared to Neal Stephenson as far as filling up pages with words. There are numerous examples of page after page of \\"who cares\\" blathering which may tell us that some of the characters are in fact terribly boring individuals but do not deepen the characterizations. One of the good points is that when you hit such a section - and the reader will recognize them - you can simply skip about 5 pages or more and pick up the story without missing anything. The book could have been shortened by about 400 pages, maybe more. I'm guessing there is an encrypted message in the pages somewhere but I couldn't care less.    Some story lines, characters and inferences are left totally unresolved in the end (e.g. what happened to the dentist?). A case of author boredom and a loss of interest as the ending approached? And why the heck did Andrew Loeb make a final appearance! Talk about out-of-place and just bizarre.    I dunno what the author is thinking sometimes but several times he comes across as just a tad too clever. At least 3 times during the book (inluding the opening pages) I didn't have a clue what he was talking about. For example, one such bit of cleverness is his incorporation of the Hindenberg disaster in New Jersey - the narrative is written at that point from the perspective of a main character who stumbles literally out of the woods after seeing a brightness in the sky. It is not central or even obliquely of interest to the story line. The author never mentions Hindenberg by name and it is left to the reader (if you can pass the author's ever-so-clever test of cleverness) to figure it out. It seemed somewhat a condescending (to the reader) writing style.    There is the usual technology-dropping (like dropping names but gadgets instead of people) to presumably up the coolness factor and from my knowledge it is mostly, but not always, believable.    Ultimately, why there is some terrific writing, the overall result is a draft that needs 1 or 2 more rewrites and a worthy ending to really tell a terrific story.      Summary - go directly to Tom Clancy's books which are executed much better and have endings that offer a consistent pay-off (but with less humour). Clancy can also go on and on... but not like this guy!    The paperback story is 1130 pages of small type that is hard to read.

B000B8QG4A|4.0|I always find the older disney movies--Lady and the tramp--ect to reflect a simpler and more robust outlook on life.
0385337388|3.0|Great book which reflects medical training about 30 years ago.  <br /> <br />However, with the new emphasis on work hour regulations, an 80 hour week, no call, and relatively few American medical graduates going into the type of Internal Medicine training described in the book, it is kind of a fossil.  <br /> <br />
B000BKJ78K|5.0|WHEN HAVING TO BUY CHRISTMAS FOR SIX KIDS, YOU ALWAYS LOOK FOR THE BEST PURCHASE.  I WENT ALL OVER TOWN TO FIND THE STAR WARS TRILOGY AT A REASONABLE PRICE, BUT COULD NOT FIND WHAT WAS IN MY PRICE LIMIT FOR THE KIDS.  PURCHASING AT AMAZON WAS VERY EASY, THE SHIPPING WAS FREE AND THE PRICE WAS WITHIN MY BUDGET.  I WAS VERY PLEASED AND MY SON HAS HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE DVDS....

B000J10ER4|5.0|I would like to say how pleased i was to purchase this product, <br /> (superman returns - full screen ) mainly because I am only ever able to purchase widescreen version of films in the u.k. <br /> because I have a projection system which allows me to view at 7ft x 7ft, <br />viewing a widescreen version of a film does not give me the same viewing <br />pleasure in effect I lose a third of the screen, so being able to purchase full screen versions is always a big bonus, thanks to amazon I was able to obtain what I wanted.

0307237699|5.0|The author writes in clear and concise language.  It is an easy read.  He gives his thoughts on taking back our country and I agree with most of his writings.  I think everyone, regardless of political views, should read this and then think for themselves.  Too much of the American way of life has been hijacked by people in power. We should not let this happen.  At the very least, our elected representatives should read this book.  We need to believe we can be better than we are currently.
B0007QS1VW|5.0|I was very happy with the ordering and delivery of this item. <br />  Very Happy
B000ETQR3Q|3.0|This gun jams regularly. Once a nerf dart jams, it gets slightly crimped by the gun and tends to jam even more often. This wouldn't be so bad if it took regular Nerf darts, but it doesn't. It takes its own special Nerf dart which I haven't been able to find for purchase anywhere. If this gun didn't jam so often and the Nerf darts would readily be available, I would most definitely rate this gun 5 stars (only because 100 stars isn't available). I have two sons (ages 6 and 10) and they already have the Nerf N-Strike that has the rocket launcher as well as a couple of pistols and a Gatlin style machine gun and they all are awesome! My wife and I often have battles with them and these other guns have lasted for a couple of years. This one is really neat and I could \\"deal\\" with the regular jams if replacement darts were available for it like they are for the others.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|It had been 30 years since seeing this film for the first time.  And I had such vivid memories of it.  It was just fabulous to watch it again.  I have already watched it 4 times now.  And having also purchased the CD I am estatic...  I remember all the words to all of the songs.  Just great!
B0007MWZEK|3.0|Overall, a helpful product.  Good battery life so far.  Easy to empty dirt tray and completely take apart if needed.  Works well on area rugs for a quick pickup but avoid fringe.<br /><br />CONS - you have to sweep 'really fast' on bare floors or the motion of the sweeper brushes blows the dust or dirt away before you can grab it.  That's a problem in my book.<br /><br />Also it grabs small cords like telephone line and tangles into the brushes.  So avoid them.
B00005K3OT|5.0|One of my favorite movies, Chocolat reveals a French town laden with guilt and tradition, perpetuated by personal idiosyncracies and fears.  When Vienne sweeps into town on the changing wind, she brings flavor and delicious possibility to the citizens, who gradually recognize that different is not necessarily evil and that \\"normal\\" does not automatically mean good or right. <br />In this movie, Juliette Binoche is fantastic as Vienne, revealing both an energetic mother and a catalyst for societal metamorphosis.  Johnny Depp adds pinache as a pseudopirate/\\"river rat.\\"  (He also composed the guitar pieces he plays in the movie.) <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy a meaningful story over flashy entertainment.  But caution: you will crave chocolate!
B000JK8OYU|1.0|I love the Beatles and have been a huge fan for over 30 years. When other little kids were asking Santa for a Big Wheel or G.I. Joe I was asking for the White Album. Seriously! Despite my love of The Beatles music,however, or maybe because of it, I find this to be an absoluetly worthless cd. <br /> <br />I just don't know what George Martin was thinking. I hope it's just old age clouding his memory. These songs did not need messing with. This isn't Let It Be-Naked, which, incidentally, was more in line with what they originally wanted in the first place. This is just sloppy remix of various song that didn't need remixing in the first place.  <br /> <br />I honestly can't belive all the 5 star rating this gets. I mean come on people, yes The Beatles were great but trash is trash. Can any of you honestly say that any of these songs is better than the original?
0064471837|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I actually listened to it.  The heroine was strong and smart.  The book itself was a great idea, unusual yet very accessible.  Great details, fun characters, and good triumphs over bad.  I think I would definitely read it at least twice!
B000GFLAI0|1.0|A concept in search of an album. I cannot but think that the continual heralds it receives are hero-worship. I love Bob Dylan, but, with the partial exception of a track or two, not this production. It is repetitive, derivative and dull. He does not do for blues what he did for country -- make it his own.<br /><br />I had to force myself to listen to it two times through. There will not be a third.
1594481717|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It's filled with cool insights, ideas, examples and it's fun to read. As a professional motivational speaker in South America I'm always looking for new ideas to nourish my own brain (I love Malcom Gladwell's books, Tom Peters' are always there, etc.). I found such kind of stuff here. Mr. Pink did a fine job and this book is definitively worth reading.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is an excellent show. I recommend watching it.
B000HEVALC|1.0|Most of the CD is inaudible.  No evidence that Johnny Cash was even there.  Save your money!  Don't purchase this product!!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Between Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives, they are both one of the best sitcoms on television. Desperate Housewives features 4-5 women on the same street, who all seem like normal, sophisticated housewives, but each have a hidden secret or two behind closed doors. The show is witty, adventurous, suspenseful and comical. At the end of each episode you are holding out for more, and are feeling disturbed, yet invigorated about what has just happened in the episode you watched. If you have never watched Desperate Housewives, I recommend you pick up Season 1 and watch it all the way thru to Season 3..you will not regret the purchases.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|Arrived very quickly, but suspiciously missing the liner notes...
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is the greatest game.  Challenging for adults, yet easy enough for kids.  My husband and I will play it even without the kids.  It is a really fun game that is super easy to learn.  It is great to have family games that don't bore the parents.  Highest recommendation!
B000I5X81K|4.0|I liked this CD very much.  I like that he's including more English songs, and several of his own compositions.  As with everything Josh has done, this is an exemplary piece of work.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|i gotta say...being a fan for over 40 years, i thought i have heard anything and everything the Beatles have ever done. Including...live performances all studio recordings, studio outtakes, bootlegs, anything Beatles...George Martin and His Son Giles have created a fresh new sound to 40 year old music and created a new sonic adventure that will blow any beatle fan's mind....george & giles have taken bits and pieces of beatles songs, drum patterns, guitar breaks and insanity and created a beautiful listen for all....i could go on for paragraphs but i'll just say <br />A MUST FOR ANY BEATLES FAN or Casual Listener..... <br />the 5.1 Surround Mix.... I promised will blow your mind.... <br />turn on your stereo...shut the lights... <br />light the incense and take a fantastic sonic journey. <br />Enjoy!
0684857219|5.0|If you like bodybuilding and weightlifting, then you owe it to yourself to get this book. Pretty much all the new stuff that's coming out nowadays is derivative of this original work. And if you're tired of seeing the gorilla-like bodybuilders of today, then Arnold Schwarzenegger's muscular and symmetric physique will definitely inspire you.
0440178002|5.0|Perhpas I'm a bit behind the curve here, I mean Shogun has been published for quite some time, but given that I was a young lad during its height of popularity, maybe I can be forgiven somewhat?   <br /> <br />This is the book that launched me on my literary quest to read through Clavell's Asian saga and, arguably, the best of that saga (Tai Pan, King Rat, Noble House, Gai Jin).  I bought a used version of the book on a whim at a yard sale and it sat on my bookshelf for nearly a year before I finally decided to see what it was about.  Once I picked it up, I literally had trouble putting it down.  I took the book with me on vacation and it was here that I found that the version I had purchased was only the first volume of a two volume set!!  I immediately went out and purchased the whole book. <br /> <br />Needless to say, I read the saga in chronological history as opposed to published history and found the whole series extremely entertaining.  Additionally, as a student of East Asian history, I found Clavell's historical fiction to be educational as well (much akin to Shaara's \\"The Killer Angels\\").  I recognize that it was not meant to be a historical document, but it certainly allows the layman to get a sense of Japanese history and culture. <br /> <br />In short, despite being a doorstopping tome (and thank goodness it is, I think I would have gone through withdrawals if it were any shorter), I cannot give enough praise to this book.
B000002PCS|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  The story and the music is outstandng.  I believe more movies of this calabar should be made.

1591391105|5.0|This book does a great job at simplifying and getting to the core issues of being in a new position.  All of the suggestions in the book are common sense, but most likely things you'd overlook when taking a new job.  The author uses great examples from people at all levels.  I highly recommend this book to anyone in a new position, whether you are a first time teamlead or a new CEO.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I bought this for my fiance, who is a HUGE Superman fan. We watched it, and even I could see that this version of Superman II is much better than the original. My boyfriend loved it, and pointed out a ton of things that made this Richard Donner cut better. I didn't quite understand the reason for the ending, but aside from that, the show was fantastic.
0060899190|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas. She requested it after viewing where she works as a bookseller but did not want to buy for herself. She reads constantly and thoroughly enjoys PostSecret. She shares her favorites with me. I find this book very interesting but I don't really get it-I have not read it myself.
0571202284|5.0|Wow, what a great resource to have and one which will be used over and over, truly an Animators Survival Guide.  Invaluable examples of artwork  covering all aspects of development.  I found I didn't need to know much to get enormous benefit from this wonderful Book.
0913866156|5.0|What to say about this deck. Simply the best, and most complicated. But it does not mean that it is not for beginer. If you begin with this one you probably wont need another for rest of your life.

B000GGSM94|3.0|While i've been listening to the Cure since my first dreary day encounter when all i thought about was sinking slowly into madness. The long awaited deluxe edition, original remasters, or whatever you want to call it has arrived. The packaging is great it seems almost like a mini box set with linear notes, (although i've said this again i hate Digipaks, they are rather hard to keep immaculate: why does Rhino feel the need to do away with jewel boxes when doing a remaster??) The album of course Brilliant. What more can you say. It's probably my second favorite since we all know nothing will surpass disintegration as the ultimate album to have ever. With that said, a die hard cure fan will love anything the cure will throw at them, maybe it's just me but i was dissapointed with the second disc. Whilst reading the package you seem to think that you are getting rare demo's and you are...to a point. The first nine tracks are intrumentals which they conveniently reveal to you INSIDE the package. Had they put this outside I would have paused and pondered on weather to buy it. It's nice to get a glimpse into the beginning recording process and what the final product sounds like but did they have to do all nine tracks? You actually get three vocal studio rough mixes. Then it closes with 6 live bootlegs. I don't know about you but i hate live versions on expanded editions. To me it's like going to a concert and the band lets the audience sing your favorite songs for them half the time. Don't get me wrong, The Fight, was probably the best cut on the second disc, but you can't help but long for the vocal arrangement on the instrumentals. That would have gave this set five stars. I can only cringe and wait to see what they are going to do with the long awaited disintegration.
B000063DFS|5.0|absolutely one of the BEST ozzy albums ever! Zaks playing style  really comes out on this and you can hear the beginnings of his now legendary musical talents on this album. Its awesome.
0553801503|5.0|If you like fantasy, but are looking for something more adult in nature, then A Song of Ice and Fire series should be on your shelf. George R. R. Martin is an excellent writer, and every book is exciting with great character development. I have read the first four, and I plan to read the next three. Highly recommended
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I ordered the excellent Al Gore movie on climate change but I was not able to play the copy delivered by Amazon because it was the wrong region-code. <br />The least thing AMAZON can do is to warn European customers when ordering such an item!

B000JCETC4|5.0|For anyone that's been alive and listening to music for the last 30 years you know that David Gilmour is high on a very short list that makes up the greatest guitar players to ever pick up the instrument. Here he gives us his first new music in over 10 years. If you are looking for the unmistakable sound and feel of Pink Floyd, you may not find it. Gilmour shows us that although his name was made producing that sound and feel, it does not define his talent. This album for me was not as accesible as his previous solo efforts, but where it is good, it's better than just about anything else out there. He went exploring for some new sounds, some new styles and a fresh feel for his guitar magic to fit into. Although at times he may have gotten a little off the path, it is still refreshing to hear an established talent growing with his music and not trying to regurgitate the same things he has done his whole career.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Put this music in your computer room and relax a little between surfing the net.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Regardless of political or other views, everyone should see this excellent video. You cannot watch it and not be affected by it. <br /> <br />The whole presentation is very well put together and the story Mr Gore tells is extremely thought-provoking.  We have now purchased 5 copies via our church and are working to get more and more copies sold/seen.  The material is that important.. <br /> <br />Buy the video, make some popcorn and watch it.  Then, invite some folks over and make some popcorn and watch it together then talk about it.... <br /> <br />It IS that important and that good!

0618680004|3.0|i am a huge dawkins fan.  he is generally caustic and brilliant, and quite original.  but this book was a disappointment.  while he does respond pretty thoroughly to the typical theological arguments in favor of religion, he spends an absurd amount of time prattling on about his high-profile critics, explaining to his readers why he doesnt \\"do\\" debates, and noting all of his wife's clever witticisms.  he also, in my opinion, was extremely lazy with \\"fact checking\\" -- he not only uses wikipedia as a source (this is virtually grounds for an \\"F\\" at my university), but presents information as \\"fact\\" when it really came from rather unreliable sources (e.g., the jesus \\"landing pad\\" theory of bush's foreign policy purported by the village voice, based solely on their super-top-secret-ultra-special-confidential memo that only the village voice is allowed to see). <br /> <br />again, dawkins is not stupid.  he is lazy...and this is further evidenced by the fact that he cites the bulk of sam harris's \\"letter to a christian nation\\" which was just released in november.  rather curious.  he additionally offers a ridiculous amount of praise and book recommendations for his friends and fellow atheists, to the point that one suspects there is a grand scheme to lube each others' reputations and pitch each others' books in the fashion of the church of scientology.  he even devotes his book to a no-name \\"convert\\" and dawkins fan.  we get it.  you are famous.  now back to the subject matter please. <br /> <br />the biggest problem with his laziness is that instead of helping the movement towards secularism, he is presenting the movement as intellectually shortchanged and overconfident.  next time dawkins, give us your all.  not just your name.

Robin Wood is a modern version <br />of waite. <br /> <br />I had an older deck of robin wood. When the new one came the paper qaulity of ther card was thinner. The weight is not there. I prefer a heavier card for different divination techniques.

B000I5X81K|5.0|bought this as a gift, came in excellent condition, and in good time.
B000HCO840|4.0|The story line held my interest from start to finish. It left possibilities for another film but at the same time allowed for a resolution of previous plots and characters that satisfied this viewer. As usual special effects ruled the show, which while entertaining can cloud the acting that is on the screen. Hugh Jackman did an admirable job and any movie with Halle berry has my vote for one of the best.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|To put it simply, Global warming is real and anyone who says or thinks differently MUST see this film. Al Gore is extremely engaging in this documentary about how humans are adversely effecting the planet. This is a must see movie, even if you hate Al Gore and his political views.

0226264211|5.0|At a current time of cynicism towards Democracy, (especially within the U.S. , with its liberal left wing professors teaching our college students to criticize capitalism, instead of helping them to understand how ideally it functions in preserving our individual freedoms), this book is a brilliant reminder that if we veer towards Socialism, as the Democratic party always does, it will lead to less incentive and less personal freedom, to create ones own life and successes, rather than having the government (strangers) redistribute our wealth.  If strangers in the government decide for us how to regulate our wealth (sound like China with the starving farmers, or Russia with an undeveloped economy, comrades?), then we are less free to do with it as we please, or to develop freely and invest it in our own interests. Hence, less freedom, more servitude to a centralized government.   <br />College students who are struggling to keep communist/socialist (left wing democrat) professors from turning them into weak, mindless,conformists and altruists, should read this book in their own spare time (as well as Ayn Rand) to continue to think for themselves and allow our system to reward and elevate those who do so, without taxing them more than those who do not.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|One of the best live concert DVD's. Worth every penny. The first one we received was defective. Amazon replaced it quickly and the return process was very painless. Picture and sound quality is excellent. The music is fantastic. You can't go wrong with this DVD from Amazon.

0440217563|4.0|I just finished re-reading Voyager, the third book in the series.  Great book, good storyline, interesting characters, and it definitely holds up for a second read.  Can't wait to read books four and five!  My only complaints (and the reasons I gave it 4 stars rather than 5) were a) waaaay too many sex scenes.  After a while, they all started melding into one and I skipped most of them - they didn't add to the story just pulled it to a grinding halt, and b) the book is TOO long.  800 pages or so is fine but when they get to be over 1,000 pages, it had better have a little bit more to it than this.   <br /> <br />With a good editor though, this book could have been amazing.  Still, all in all, good job - and I plan on starting book four tomorrow.

B000148KK2|4.0|Although I've heard indivudaul songs by Diana Krall, this is the first of her CDs I purchased. I liked her when I first heard her on the radio which is what prompted me to buy the CD; and, I was not disappointed. She is a great jazz vocalist and pianist. I liked her playing as well as her singing. She's very easy to listen to and does not have a monotinous style. Overall, the album is well put together and has a lot of great songs on it.
0064440346|5.0|I originally purchased this book when my children were young, and it was nearly worn out from the numerous readings.  My children loved the \\"bumps\\" and I always used the \\"tear water tea\\" to remind my kids when everything seemed to be going wrong in their world.  It is a great little book for children...and some of us adults as well.

B000GRTQSE|5.0|A great collection of tracks with a variety of pace and lyrical content.  The older more mature voice still stands up not unlike more recent Johnny Cash and Leonard Cohen albums.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Foreign subtitled films at times can be grueling to watch, but the acting and directing is so superb, that you feel you understand every little thing even if you do not read every word of the subtitling.  This movie comes highly recommended from some who considers herself quite a movie buff!!  Treat yourself to this film!
B00006LI4S|5.0|David Gilmour without the fog machine, Mr. Screen, and the rest of the Floyd trappings gets to the essence of the music.  Gilmour really seems to be enjoying himself on this effort.  The arrangements of some of the classics are a little different which puts a Gilmour interpretation to some of the Floyd classics.  I especially liked the less formal approach to the backing band and singers.  Just a wonderful sonic production from beginning to the wonderful extras.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I enjoy Sarah McLachlan...and this is no exception. She has made a great X-mas CD.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is an adorable movie with a cute message.This is both entertaining for children and adults.
0671449028|5.0|My 2 1/2 yr. old daughter really enjoys this book. She likes the pictures and the rhyming text. My husband and I like reading it to her...it's not so long as to lose her attention and it's fun to read. I have bought Sandra Boynton books for all my kids.
B0002S947K|5.0|Every song on this album is great. I play it over and over. It's my addiction!
0529064847|5.0|Christmas Gift for my sister, reasonable shipping charges, she enjoyed it very much.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Ray's album is excellent from beginning to end. No bad songs here!
B000GFRJ58|2.0|I own tons of Dual Discs and have had no problems with any of them. I own a Sony high-end SACD/DVD player and it'll play anything I throw at it. The CD side of this item plays fine. The extra features are pretty swell, too. The very opening seconds of the DVD side are improperly mastered which causes an annoying \\"stutter\\" as the disc attempts to initiate the Surround Sound. I checked it on my other player, same thing. Being that there are no surface scratches or any defects visible, rather than bothering Amazon with returning the item, I have contacted the manufacturer(Hip-O) THREE TIMES to try to have this addressed only to be told someone will get back to me with no replies. This has been since 10-28-06. So if you want to listen to the first cut on the CD side, stop, flip it over to the Dual Disc side and reinitiate play at the second track, it's pretty swell. For those of you nostalgic about missing the flipping over of a vinyl record(not I), it may be right up your alley. No more Hip-O purchases for me. There's plenty of other music out there.
1569242739|5.0|I gave this book to my daughters for Christmas, with the implied promise that we would be baking together more often.  Doh!  I didn't realized it would mean that every day, when I come home from work, I am greeted by salivating children and husband, demanding to know WHICH cupcakes I'm making tonight!  So far--Gingerbread, Crimson Velveteen, and Banana Split have taken the cake.  Next up--Lychee!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is my husband's all time favorite TV movie.  Every time it came on TV, if he knew about it, he would watch.  Now he can watch it whenever he wants.  We both think Robert Duvall is great!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|YOU MUST ADD THIS TO YOUR MOVIES FOR CHRISTMAS...IT IS FUNNY...IT IS WONDERFUL...GREAT MOVIE...FUNNY....MAKES YOU REMEMBER THAT YOUR FAMILY IS NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE A CRAZY CHRISTMAS GATHERING
B000I0QK74|5.0|If you enjoy listening to the wonderful voice of James Taylor as most baby boomers do and actually an awful lot of older and younger fans as well then , you will surely love this holiday album. Listening to James at Christmas is like listening to Bing Crosby. It just fits !!  Step up and get a copy as you will be glad you did. There is no such thing as a bad JT album.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|What can I say! Once again Damien Rice has produced another CD of intense, honest, beautiful songs that fill your heart with love and eyes with tears. Damien just keeps getting better and better.
6305511055|4.0|Excellent movie, showing years ago what we are experiencing now with gas and oil prices zooming.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Dirty Dancing is a great movie. My sister and I watched it all the time when we a little younger. I love the Music, Characters and The Dancing. I wish it was me playing the part of Baby (The Star). I can watch this movie over and over again.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|We love this film. My son just can't stop watching it. He thinks it's the best film he has seen in a long time.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|This movie is a must see for anyone who is planning to live on this Earth for the next 10-100 years.  <br />It is an eye-opening movie that will make you want to get up and be proactive, not just reactive.  It has inspired me to be more mindful when it comes to recycling items, using less fuel and less energy at home.   <br /> <br />Al gore's documentary might be a little long and strenous at times, but it captures a lot of vital information that many people might not even know about.   <br /> <br />I suggest everyone over the age of 13 should watch it and spread the word on this 'inconvenient truth'.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins is brilliant. It is the most logical book I have ever read debunkiing anti evolutionary development. It is concise it is intelligent and without obfuscations.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Some of the songs are just as amazing as his first cd, others fall short.
0321344758|5.0|This book is a must have for all web designers and a great gift for those customers who need a quick read overview of what makes a good site.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The dvd was inexpensive, came in perfect condition and relatively fast
0843176881|5.0|I gave this to my 3 year old nephew.  After his mother read it to him, he called me on the phone very excited to tell me how much he enjoyed the book.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is challenging and exciting.  It is a great family game or just to play with your friends.  I would highly recomend it.  It doesn't take long to learn to play the game and is extremely easy to set up and put away.  Buy the game and enjoy!
0843175621|5.0|My nephew called me to tell me how much he enjoyed the book after his mother read it to him.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|The environmental movement as it was previously known has been placed in the out of sight out of mind mentality.  This film needs to be seen by all who want to be open minded enough to view the evidence and see for oneself what is or is not occuring. It is irresponsible to comment on global warming with conviction unless this film is included in ones basis of knowledge about the subject.  Decide for yourself, see this side of history and you will be informed and make the choice that you feel is best!!!!!  I am confident it will empower you to make the judgement of what will be our future. <br />Please put aside any previous notions about Al Gore/politics/activists and see the film for your information to decide what choices you will make about your future?    <br />
B00007KWHN|5.0|This is another album I listened to over and over in the early 70s, then put away.  Hearing it now is something of a revelation -- there are all kinds of interesting things going on musically, and the lesser-known tunes on here (\\"A Venture\\") are just as good as the familiar ones.  I used to go to a burger place on Mass. Ave. in Boston in the summer of '74, and for some reason they had \\"The Clap\\" on their jukebox.  Those were the days.  I guess Rick Wakeman was inevitable, but for me, this is the best Yes album.
B000CBSHK2|3.0|This release has the typical melancholy sound that Beth Orton is known for and if you are looking for that quintesential mellow mood, this is your music.  I have only listened to the entire CD twice, but my initial opinion is that it doesn't have much diversity of style.  The songs sound very much the same and do not venture into the more experimental style of songs found on some of her other releases.  That said, I will continue to listen to it because often it takes many more times through before a CD grows on a person.  It is a nice alternative to the mainstream pop music which draws the listener in with a catchy beat and simplistic lyrics. This latest release, along with almost all of Beth Orton's music can never be accused of that.  Her music forces the listener to focus on the lyrics which are often symbolic and her flat key segway doesn't allow you to drift away.  This release continues that tradition.  It may not be the CD I would recommend for those not familiar with Beth Orton's music but it carries enough interest for fans of Beth's music that I say it's worth a listen.
B00000JQFM|4.0|This is a great CD, older but totally joe.  I need to get more of his music!
0345350499|5.0|Instead of typing out a contrite or, worse, convoluted summary of this work of art - because that is what this amazing novel is-, it would be better for me to say what it is about this (I'll admit) very long novel: <br /> <br />1- It is full  of lessons of spirituality, some truths and some exaggerations of Christianity, and many historical facts about the ancient Celtic religions. <br /> <br />2- You will grow to have some type of feelings for each and every character. Contrary to the opinion of another reviewer, I do not think it was difficult to keep up with names and relationships at all. The character development is exquisite. <br /> <br />3- The plot is so grippingly interesting that you won't want to put this down! <br /> <br />4- The perspective is a fresh take on the traditional Arthurian stories, with female characters in the forefront. <br /> <br />5- This was a very modern-minded writer! I personally  believe she must have been a feminist, because this book is quite empowering to women. Also, there is much to learn from the lessons that different characters are presented with throughout the book.  <br /> <br />In short, this novel was NOTHING SHORT of AMAZING! It made me cry, laugh, sit on the edge of my seat, and -most of all- wish I was living in the story! <br /> <br />Happy Reading!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I heard a snippet of \\"Careless Love\\" on NPR, and purchased the album right away. I was not dissapointed.  Madeleine's voice is beyond silky with a dainty crispness that makes you really listen for the next phrase.  The tempo goes from sulky peevishness ( a la Billy Holiday) to a confident soft-spoken strut.  Great guitar and drums are backing her on most tracks, but with that intimate feeling of just enough support for her great voice and sexy phrasing; it's all Madeleine.  I gave a copy to my son, (26) and my daughter (27), they both loved it and they are all about jazz, blues and music traditions. It is really my favorite new album from all of last year; however, I bought her latest release and it was a letdown.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is a great CD and what's more its a perfect DVD the sound is more than great. Mr Martin & son did a great job keeping The Beatles as group alive. I can only say one thing to the readers... Buy it and flow back the years.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I love Jane Austen's novels and wasn't sure how well I'd like this film version. But I was pleasantly surprised. If you are a purest, you may be a little frustrated by what is omitted in order to fit this into a feature film length, but by and large I couldn't really disagree with the director's choices here.  My favorite film version for fidelity to Austen's text is still the BBC version made in the 1980's staring Elizabeth Garvie. But this one is worth your time because it tells the stories of characters you love from a new perspective. This telling is focused on making the Bennets, as a family, believable in their interactions with one another, even if it means softening the flaws of each character a little. For example, traditionally inattentive Mr. Bennet is shown comforting Mary who breaks into tears after her musical performance is rejected at the Netherfiled ball.  I also thought Kira Knightly did a nice job of portraying Elizabeth as someone who really does love to laugh.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I love this album - listened to it more then any others this year.  There are a couple of songs  that are priceless - One is \\"IN the bleak mid-winter\\".  I may have driven some people a bit crazy listening to it so often.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Believe it or not, this movie was a hit on my college campus 15 years ago and it's a hit now.  I thought it was entertaining then, watching through the eyes of a five year old now is a hundred times better.  Just a great, creative, Disney movie. <br />
0440242576|5.0|I liked the book.  It was really easy to read and flowed well.  I finished it in 3 days.  I like all of his books and would recommend any to anyone.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Pure Yanni, as allways. You like or you don't. But if you like, it's pure pleasure.
0066620996|5.0|Excellent book!  This should be on a \\"must read\\" list for all executives.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie made a believer in me. The facts in it....along with the photographs are an unmistakeable message to pay attention and take action. We only have one planet. The frog in the hot water analogy was the most vivid explaination of our attitude I've ever seen. I just hope it's not too late.......
B000AYQJJ2|4.0|I remember seeing glimpses of this concert somewhere when I was a kid and was intrigued, as a burgeoning young listener and musician.  Since then I've discovered and come to appreciate greatly the Beatles together and separately.  Among the discoveries is an absolute love for George's album All Things Must Pass.  I daresay, it's my favorite solo Beatle project and ironically so, as I'm not so enthused about George's subsequent solo career as much as I love what I think I know of him as a person.  I find most of what was to follow to be kind of bland musically, but mostly spoiled by some really muddled production/engineering.  <br /> <br />So, that said, I did go into the viewing of the Concert for Bangladesh with some trepidation, because I didn't want to not like it.  I was happily amazed.  All the performers seemed on top of thier game, the sound and the mix is fantastic and George's character really shines through.  From Ravi Shankar's performance right to the end I think every song is a gem...even when George fumbles some lines in Something in the Way She Moves.  Russell, Preston, Ringo and even Clapton (though he seemed a bit subdued) all shine in this concert.  It must have been incredible to be there. <br /> <br />If your a Beatle or George Harrison fan, (and you have a few dollars)there is no reason not to have this DVD.
B000F8O35U|5.0|First of all the movie arrived much earlier than was estimated online, so that in itself was a pleasant surprise.  I have been waiting for this movie to be re-released for years so as soon as I saw it I knew I had to have it.  I am extremely happy with the product. <br /> <br />Thanks <br />Kathy Marshy
B000FQ4M58|3.0|NOT MEATLOAF AT IS VERY VERY BEST.       SOME TRACKS ARE BRILLIANT OTHERS LESS THAN AVERAGE.     HENCE JUST 3 STARS.
B000I5X81K|5.0|WONDERFUL!  THIS MAN HAS SO MUCH TALENT. I CAN LISTEN TO HIM ALL DAY LONG.
B000HWZ4A2|2.0|For the times this movie was made, the acting is good. I would love to see this same story done in more modern times where I believe the acting would be less in the dramatic style and seem more real to life. If you've read the book, this movie cuts out so much of what I loved in the book. I wish not only that it would be done in modern times but I can see it being done in a trilogy style to capture all the interaction of characters and the essence of the story would be more complete. If you have to choose between the book and the movie, choose the book!
093183841X|4.0|We haven't had a chance to use this book to the fullest, but it seems to be a great resource to find out about old cameras. My husband's late father had a camera collection that was passed down to him and we plan to look up all of the cameras in this book to find out if we should be adding them to our homeowner's insurance. <br /> <br />Great buy!!
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is Altman in top form. Within the combined form of the upstairs/downstairs whodunnit, he is able to observe his all-star cast of characters with the same social withering glance he usually had fixed on the USA (see \\"Nashville\\"). And when many of these salvos are let loose by Dame Maggie Smith, whats not to love? We can see many of the masters leitmotifs in action all exercised with delicious control. Beautiful production values in an idyllic English landscape make for many enjoyable revisits to this film.
B000JCETDS|3.0|Good album with some great tracks. Not as good as the first album which had a great variety of songs. The songs on this album are direct from the movie, so if you havent seen the movie, it will all sound a bit odd.
1931382794|5.0|I am an experienced racer in triathlon and MTB ultra-distance events.  This book, coupled with my new power measuring tools and my long-time use of a heart rate monitor, has taken my training to new levels.  I am a detail-oriented, technical person, and the book satisfied my need for insights into how and why things are recommended or advocated.  I found the advice and techniques to be absolutely useful in helping me improve my knowledge and my performance.  I am wasting less time training wrong and getting more back from my sessions in the few months since I began reading this book-- but it will take me years to master the material inside, which tells me that I've got a real reference as opposed to an owner's manual here.  If you're going to train with power, don't do it without this book.
0689878451|5.0|Very well written and illustrated, beautiful reading for children of all ages.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|Once again Scissor Sisters have proved themselves with their funky beats and characteristic lyrics.  This album, like their previous debut album, leaves a listener dancing till the sun goes down and creates a harmonic atmosphere.  The Scissor Sister's groovy tunes are complimented with the Jason Shean's unusual/upbeat voice.  And once the disk is over just open up the second panel, which is presented as opening elevator doors, and pop in the bonus disk which does not fail to keep the party moving.  Some songs that stand out from the rest are \\"I don't feel like dancin\\" from the first disk, \\"Making Ladies\\" and \\"Almost Sorry\\" from the bonus disk.
B000I2IT44|5.0|incredible performance by porcupine tree ,  this guys are all about music, each and every member dominates their instrument like masters, the playlist is great, the sound is perfect, i wish i was there, one of the best bands around
B000HCO83Q|4.0|Well the special effects and the casting of the movie could'nt be better,  <br />but, the story was so lacking as far as the x-men characters go. <br />I realy hope the next x-men movie has a better storyline that gives some <br />kind of depth to x-men characters.
0060899190|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY 20 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVED IT. THANK YOU
B00011F5DK|5.0|Love this game! It's easy to learn, very few rules, and lots of room for strategy type moves. My 14 year old son beats me, but only 40% of the time! 2 can play, 3 or 4 at a time. If your family likes games, this is a must have.
B000I5X81A|4.0|This mix works right: not a bunch of celebrity duets, but a real album-long collaboration with a distinctive sound.  The sound reminds me a little of Ry Cooder, a dash of folk-country with some blues and rock.  Not a lot of blazing guitar solos, but nice, tasty guitar and vocals and consistently good sound throughout.  One of Clapton's better works.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|...I wouldn't advocate this as a must-have addition to a collection otherwise; some of the re-mixes are pleasantly intriguing at the first listen or two, but few are what I'd call \\"compelling\\".<br /><br />Fab-Four lover? ...you'll enjoy it, but it's unlikely to supplant any of your long-time favorites.
B000DN6ZGC|4.0|As other reviews note, this artist is misleadingly compared to jazz and r&b vocalists.  She's NOT Billie Holiday or someone who sounds like her (like Madeline Peyroux, for instance).  But she has a distinctive voice and good grooves.  The album is pretty consistent with most cuts being as listenable as the \\"hit,\\" \\"Put Your Records On.\\"
B000E5N62U|2.0|...to someone who genuinely enjoyed Fagen's clever work on \\"The Nightfly\\" and \\"Kamakiriad\\"; no new ground is broken here, and I'll likely end up giving it away.
B000GFLEAY|5.0|Sound and picture quality on this HD-DVD are mind blowing !!! <br />Highly recommended to everyone !
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I first saw this film when it came out in theaters. From that point forward I intended to purchase this DVD and loan it to anyone and everyone that had not seen the film. It is important to raise everyone's awareness of the problems we face if we do not deal with climate change.<br /><br />Buy this DVD. Watch it. Loan it to others. Get involved! We only have one planet. Let's make sure our kids and grandkids have one as well!
B000HA4WTS|5.0|Sound and picture quality on this HD-DVD are mind blowing !!! <br />Highly recommended to everyone !

B000HT3PPG|5.0|Very happy to get this version in color. Plus a 2 disc set for a great price.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|ITS A MUST !!!! <br /> <br />You must have it... <br /> <br />Pablo
B000BNI90O|5.0|All true LoR fans will love this. I haven't done it yet, but it would be most enjoyable, I would think, to read the Trilogy again w this soundtrack as background music. Don't know, but worth a go. The only minor regret I had was that I missed Galadriel's \\"explanation\\" of how the Ring came to be that was on the original soundtrack. But that's a small thing. Overall, the music is stirring, and conjures images of the beginning of the journey, the Fellowship being formed, its early escapades ... joy, dread, happiness, grief, adventure. Well worth the price.
B000068FUM|5.0|THIS CD IS FABULOUS.  NO FLAWS.  EVERY SONG A MASTERPIECE.  A SPIRITUAL GENIUS AT WORK.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this movie for my son,who is crazy about cars,but belive me every one at home liked the movie a LOT. <br /> <br />I got it at the cheapest rate possible at Amazon so this added to the FUN of watching the movie. <br /> <br />I would say this is a MUST buy if you like movies..a movie for all ages
B000008I5I|5.0|MAYBE THE GREATEST MUSICAL GENIUS EVER.  THIS SET HAS THE BEST OF THE BEST.  ONE SONG AFTER ANOTHER, EACH AS GOOD AS THE PRIOR.  ANYONE WHO COLLECTS ANY MUSIC SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS THEIR FIRST SELECTION.  A MUST TO OWN.
0307237699|5.0|The book restored my hope that our country can overcome the divides that have been created politically. Much harm has been done by the recent climate of attack and destroy \\"the enemy\\" approach to obtaining politcal power and it is a real turn off to civilized people. One person, one side is NOT always right and getting too powerful leads to blind decisions. OBama has a sensible, calm view of where we are, how we got there, and how to work our way out of it.
0307237699|3.0|Barack was very truthful, objective and honest.  Truly a kindered spirit and a wonderful person.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadden are perfect for this film. I am so impressed with both of their acting in this film. The others in the film are also perfectly cast, most believable and entertaining. I'd like to see Keira and Matthew in another film, perhaps Sense and Sensibility? I would love that or even Jane Eyre. I'm sure they could un-pretty Keira for the part.
0452287588|5.0|Excellent read !  A must for those who want to find their own life's purpose and to help understand the human ego.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is an amazing series from HBO and is extremely well done.  Either for the average person or the knowledgable historian this World War II series that follows from stateside training to the end of combat in WWII or a unit of the 101 Airborne is fascinating, accurate, gut-wretching and attention grabbing all at the same time. Highly recommended!!!
B00006WUWQ|5.0|we love Austin Powers movies. Mike Myers is a comic genius and so funny playing all different characters. we luagh everytime we watch any of the movies and don't seem to get tired of them. fat bastard is our favorite character of all. highly recommended.
0060776579|5.0|This is a great recording that can transform anyone's perspectives of life in regards to financial freedom.  <br /> <br />For instance, one key insight I derived and, now practice, from T. Harv's  message is that \\"without passive income, you can't be financially free\\" Another is quantity-\\"how many people do you really serve, affect or help in your line of business?\\" As  a Real Estate investor, I now think big, and have made commitment to providing affordable housing to lots of people; thus earning impressive passive income doing that.  <br /> <br />T. Harv Eker's CD message has throughly transformed my financial life, and can transform yours too! <br /> <br />Joe Nwoga <br />
B0009WFFS6|4.0|After 40 years these guys still rock. The cream of the crop in the 60's -  Jack, Ginger and Eric put on a show of immense importance. To hear these super talented guys play together again was a gift and luckily they made a DVD of the event.  <br />SADDLY the video director had not a clue of the importance of the talent before him. The guitar player once referred to as GOD is in the middle of a blazing guitar solo and this inept director shows a close up of Eric face! Terrible camera angles add to the abysmal coverage. This \\"director\\" should be shot.  However, The audio portion of the DVD is superb!  <br />One can only imagine how great this would have been with a competent video director.
B000BNI95Y|4.0|I never received my order of this CD. <br />I have heard 3 songs only, which captured my attention. <br />If your someone who likes latin music or other earthly <br />exotic sounds this is a great collection to have!. <br /> <br />I hope that maybe you can check my order to see <br />if it can get here!. <br /> <br />Thank you, <br />Pablo de la Cruz
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I dont get why the others are whining about how dissapointed they are with this CD. I love it. It is all the wonderful middle eastern rythyms mixed with old traditional songs of the Isles that we love Loreena for. OK, she uses one or two melodies from previous songs but I actually think that is OK, IF you love Loreen McKennitt, dont even hesitate. Her voice is still like an angel! AND it beats playing the old ones over and over again!
0307346609|5.0|Reading this book is like watching an incredibly written, tightly edited, and fast-paced television series.  Brooks manages to create, in each first-hand account, a narrative you can identify with as a reader.  You'll hope for these people-- and understand their frailties and human limits in the face of insurmountable odds.  The creeping, inevitable, cancer-esque menace of the living dead is present in every page. <br /> <br />I was never a fan of the \\"zombie\\" movie genre, and may never be still.  Brooks' work stands head and shoulders above other works in his chosen subject.   <br /> <br />For some fun, see the World War Z home page and the \\"calculate risk\\" tab to see what your chances of survival are should the dead ever rise on a global scale.
B000F8O35U|4.0|My kids love this film (and so do I), but the extras on the 2nd dvd are pretty pathetic.  Instead of an actual game, like many of the Disney dvds, they have a simulated Disneyworld ride.  Pretty boring, really.  If you can get it cheaper, I would just order the 1 dvd (previous version) and not bother with the \\"special edition\\".  We have an old vhs of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" in which the voice actress appears at the end and sings.  The kids enjoyed this version a lot more (would've been the one that came out in the late 90's, I think).
B00009NHC5|5.0|We purchased this DVD used and were very happy with the quality of the DVD. The movie is one of our favorites and we were happy to get it as such a good price and in suce excellent condition.
B0002V7O9C|5.0|My kids of course love Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, as do I, but they also really enjoyed Prancer.  This was a great package deal and I'm sure the dvds will be viewed frequently for years to come.
0152023984|5.0|The little Prince is from another planet where he lives a very simple life. He visits Earth and has many experiences what we take for granted. While the story is fun and child-like, the messages delivered to the reader with each encounter is wonderful. James Dean, while struggling as a young actor, read the chapter about the fox. He considered it to be the most significant passage he had ever read. The love story between Saint-Exupery and his wife (The Rose) also touches the heart. <br />For parents, this is required reading to help you explain the right things about life to your children, no matter what their age.
1843104954|5.0|This is a very well written and thorough description of Asperger's Syndrome. It is much more complete than his previous book (Asperger's Syndrome A Guide for Parents and Professionals). Reading this book will give you a better sense of the range of this disorder and its  various presentations.  In addition to the description of the syndrome, there are many helpful ideas on treatment. These are directed to professionals but many  can be implemented by parents.

0792833201|4.0|Directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), written and  produced by Steven Spielberg, this film has excellent credentials and doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The potential gory excesses of Tobe Hooper have been reined in by Spielberg (although there are still some grisly moments- I'll never feel the same about a midnight snack again!!), so we are left with an absorbing and emotional story acted out brilliantly (Jobeth Williams and Graig 'Mr. Incredible' Nelson in particular).<br /><br />The effects are very 80s and don't look too good now, but the strength of the film is its grounding in domestic reality and, for once, the viewer can identify with an ordinary bunch of people and feel afraid for them, rather than just not caring which of the super-pretty teenagers is going to get eaten next.<br /><br />This is a good, old fashioned ghost story with plenty of scares and plenty of heart.
B00008J2PG|4.0|A wunderfull film, a good an true story. It's so sad that there is no german sound, for me and my family are living in germany. <br />If somebody has a german sound for this movie (Im Wendekreis des Kreuzes)I would be very glad to heare about and maybe to buy it.

I'm not kidding!<br /><br />It covers so many areas of spiritual growth in a simple and clear matter.<br /><br />His section on Grace is right on. It is hard to beleive that when Scott Peck wrote this book he was an agnostic. It is deeply spiritual and will bring healing to broken lives (mine included).<br /><br />If you ever wanted to know the true definition of Love - read this book.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|What an interesting monster movie!   You get vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein, and Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde all rolled into one.   This movie takes advantage of the current state of special effects and makes most everything appear quite lifelike. <br /> <br />The film has an overall dark, gothic feel to it, with good performances by vampire hunter Hugh Jackman in the title role and by the lovely Kate Beckinsale.   <br /> <br />The film is not for the faint hearted, there's lot's of violence and gore. If you're a fan of vampire movies, you'll like this one.

0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris takes a sensitive and controversial subject and makes complete sense.   Finally someone is brave enough to talk about the fact that belief in ancient, nonsensical and contradictory ideas can not only be foolish, it can be down right dangerous!  Mr. Harris is a very smart young man with a lot of experience studying religion, philosophy and now neuroscience.  He could easily have written over our heads.  But instead he explains ideas so very clearly that you not only get it, it rings true as though you always knew it, and now you want everyone to read this book.  Now I'm reading Carl Sagan's Varieties of Scientific Experience---equally as sensible, easy to read and enlightening.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Not the doom and gloom film that I was expecting, it was more inspiring and hopeful. Yes, the facts are alarming, but Al Gore does offer solutions, and hope, that we can all work together and deal with this. I am impressed with his work and dedication to spreading this information. The production itself is of the highest quality and makes the information easy to assimilate. This is just the type of effort needed to encourage us all to think, and act, more consciously, as we make our everyday decisions. Share this with your children, and anybody who is willing to hear the Inconvenient Truth. It concerns EVERYONE!
B0002OERI0|5.0|How could anyone NOT have this CD? This band has become a true rock legend with this CD, don't know how they will ever surpass the greatness of the music they have created here.
0689870280|4.0|My son loves Sandra Boynton books and always picks them for his bedtime stories.  I love them and enjoy the ease and simplicity of the books.  He is not reading yet, but we have read them so many times he can repeat them back to me.  Very fun books.
B0006L5RXS|5.0|This CD sets down a strong sense of who (The)Sweet was.  A cross between bubblegum and rock, glam and hard rock.  On par with such notables as Queen, T-Rex, Gary Glitter and Slade.  Thirty years later, Ballroom Blitz can still rock the house.<br /><br />In March 1971, The Sweet's \\"Funny Funny\\" single became their first international hit, climbing to the Top 20 on many of the world's charts. Although the next single, \\"All You'll Ever Get From Me\\" (May 1971) failed to chart, \\"Co-Co\\" (June 1971) became a big hit (UK #2), which outsold \\"Funny Funny\\". But the following single, \\"Alexander Graham Bell\\" (October, 1971) was only a minor hit (UK #33).<br /><br />The Sweet's first official LP titled Funny How Sweet Coco Can Be was released towards the end of 1971, but failed to chart. An oddly endearing collection of Chinn/Chapman novelty tunes (\\"Chop Chop\\", \\"TomTom Turnaround\\") and ill-fitting pop covers (the Lovin' Spoonful's \\"What a Day for a Daydream\\", the Supremes' \\"Reflections\\"), the album stands fairly well now for devoted Sweet fans, but it wasn't much then as a serious contender on the charts. As the LP faded into obscurity, The Sweet found themselves being labelled by music critics as nothing more than a Top 40 singles band. Furthermore, Chinn and Chapman did their best to destroy the band's chance of respectability by bringing in session musicians, a la The Monkees, to play on the records, even though The Sweet were quite competent musically.<br /><br />The relationship between The Sweet and Nicky Chinn/Mike Chapman was becoming increasingly tense. One major reason was that The Sweet were not happy with the Bubblegum image that was being cast on them. As a result, their B-sides got heavier with each release. Done Me Wrong All Right, the self-penned B-side of Co-Co amazed some listeners who had hated the pop sound but loved their rock style and realised there was more to the band than they had thought. This dichotomy of bubblegum A-sides and heavy rock B-sides only served to confuse their teenage fan following. Indeed, The Sweet's live performances consisted of B-sides, album tracks and various medleys of rock n roll classics; rarely were the singles played live.<br /><br />In February 1972, \\"Poppa Joe\\" was released and stopped at the gates of the British Top 10. The next two singles of the year, \\"Little Willy\\" and \\"Wig-Wam Bam\\" both peaked at #4 on the UK charts. Although \\"Wig-Wam Bam\\" remained largely true to the style of The Sweet's previous recordings, the vocals and guitars had a harder, more rock-oriented sound--largely because it was the first The Sweet single on which the real members of The Sweet played. It was in many ways, a transition single, paving the way for the change of musical emphasis that came in January 1973 with \\"Block Buster\\" (later often as \\"Blockbuster\\"), The Sweet's first (and only) chart-topping single, which quickly reached #1 on the UK singles chart. \\"Hell Raiser\\" was released in May and reached position #2, which was repeated by the subsequent singles, \\"Ballroom Blitz\\" (September, 1973) and \\"Teenage Rampage\\" (February, 1974).<br /><br />As the group's popularity grew, The Sweet put in a heavy schedule of UK and European TV promotional appearances, including numerous Top Of The Pops and Supersonic slots. The Sweet soon picked up a large teenage audience. The band also capitalised on the Glam explosion, rivalling Gary Glitter, T. Rex, Queen, Wizzard, and Slade for outrageous stage clothing.<br /><br />By 1974, The Sweet had grown tired of the artistic control Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman exerted over their career, hence the group decided to record without the duo. The resulting album, Sweet Fanny Adams, was their first UK Top 40 chart album. The Sweet's technical proficiency was demonstrated for the first time on self-penned hard rock tracks such as \\"Sweet FA\\" and \\"Set Me Free\\". The Sweet also dropped their glam image in favour of a more conventional hard rock appearance. In response to UK music critics, The Sweet concentrated on proving their musical talents with self-written, hard rock/pop album tracks.<br /><br />The Sweet Fanny Adams album (first for the band who dropped The and called themselves SWEET) also featured compressed high-pitched backing vocal harmonies, which was a trend that continued on all of Sweet's albums. Sweet, and contemporary UK band Queen, were both recognised as one of the main exponents of high-pitched harmonies during the 1970s.<br /><br />In 1975, Sweet went back into the studio to re-arrange and record a more pop oriented version of track \\"Fox On The Run\\", which originally appeared on the 1974 Desolation Boulevard LP. Sweet's first self-written and produced single, \\"Fox On The Run\\" (March, 1975) was released worldwide and instantly became their biggest selling hit, reaching number one in Germany and Australia, number two in Great Britain and the Netherlands and number five in the U.S.A. (1976 release). The following single issue, \\"Action\\" (July, 1975) peaked at UK #15 (Since 1975, all subsequent RCA and Polydor single releases were now referred to as simply Sweet).<br /><br />Now confident in their own songwriting and production abilities, Sweet spent the latter half of 1975 in Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany, where they recorded the Give Us A Wink album with German sound engineer Reinhold Mack (aka Mack), who later recorded with Electric Light Orchestra and Queen.<br /><br />January 1976 saw the release of \\"The Lies In Your Eyes\\". This single was not very successful around the world, except parts of Europe and Australia. As a result of its success, Australia was the only country to get the follow up single \\"4th Of July\\". The follow-up single was the world-wide release of \\"Lost Angels\\". This single was only popular in Germany. \\"Give Us A Wink\\", Sweet's first fully produced and written LP was released in March 1976.<br /><br />Between October 1976 and January 1977, Sweet wrote and recorded new material at Kingsway Recorders and Audio International London studios for their next album. In April 1977, Off The Record was released, which was Sweet's final RCA album release. The first single from the album, \\"Fever of Love\\", represented the band heading in a somewhat more Europop hard rock direction. On this album, Sweet again worked with Give Us A Wink engineer Louie Austin, who would later engineer Def Leppard's On Through The Night 1980 debut album.<br /><br />The 1976 and 1977 years featured Sweet as a more album oriented, glam metal act. Albums such as Give Us a Wink and Off the Record were undoubtedly Sweet's heaviest studio albums. Indeed, U.S. Top 20 chart entry \\"Action\\" was the group's hardest rocking hit single. \\"Stairway To The Stars\\" was Sweet's final single release for RCA.<br /><br />In 1985, Andy Scott and Mick Tucker re-formed Sweet with various new vocalists and bass players, the most notable being a 1986 reunion featuring Paul Mario Day (the first singer of Iron Maiden), keyboardist Phil Lanzon, and bass player Malcolm McNulty. Steve Priest was asked to join Tucker and Scott for the 1985 Australian tour, but declined at the last moment. Vocalist and bass player Jeff Brown joined in 1988. In 1991, Mick Tucker departed due to ill health, leaving Andy Scott as the only original member. After Tucker's departure, Andy Scott changed the band's name to 'Andy Scott's Sweet'. In 2003, Tony O'Hora replaced Jeff Brown as lead vocalist. As of 2006, the line-up consists of Andy Scott, Bruce Bisland, and Steve Grant.<br /><br />In 1988, Connolly, Scott, Priest, and Tucker briefly reformed to record music for the first time in nine years. Some reworked studio versions of \\"Action\\", and \\"Ballroom Blitz\\", were recorded in Los Angeles. However, Connolly's vocals were deemed unsatisfactory by the three other group members, hence the reunion was brief. (After a mugging/beating in which his assailant(s) repeatedly kicked him in the throat, Connolly's voice never really recovered, and he was unableto sing with the strength and purity he'd had on early-to-mid-70s Sweet music.)<br /><br />In 1990, all four members were again re-united for the promotion of a video music documentary, titled \\"Sweet's Ballroom Blitz\\". This UK release, which contained UK television performances from the 1970s, including current-day interviews, was released at Tower Records, London.<br /><br />Brian Francis [McManus] Connolly died from liver failure and repeated heart attacks February 9, 1997, aged 51, having been content in his final years to appear in retrospective documentaries demonstrating the damage he had inflicted upon himself. He was cremated after a ceremony at Most Holy Name Roman Catholic Church at Old Mill Lane, Denham, Buckinghamshire and his ashes were scattered over the water by his adult daughters Nicola and Michelle. He also left an ex-wife, Marilyn, and a two-year-old son called Brian Junior (BJ) by his girlfriend Jean.<br /><br />Michael Tomas (Mick) Tucker died February 14, 2002 in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire from leukaemia, aged 54; his funeral took place February 25, 2002. He is buried in an un-named grave in Chorleywood House cemetery. The location is 51 deg 39.644 minutes North, 0 degrees 30.330 minutes West (WGS84). It is marked by a sleeping angel. A wooden bench with a brass plaque funded by fans as a dedication to Mick is also positioned in the grave's vicinity. He left behind a widow, Julie, and a daughter Ayston. According to Steve Priest: \\"He was the most underrated drummer that ever came out of England. He was the powerhouse of the band. He was technically marvellous. His timing was impeccable, but he had a lot of soul as well and he really felt what he was playing.\\"<br /><br />At least one of Sweet's two remaining members is still active in the music industry. Andy Scott currently continues to tour as 'Andy Scott's Sweet'. February 2006 saw the release of a new Suzi Quatro album, \\"Back To The Drive\\", which was produced by Andy Scott. March 2006saw the US release of a new AS Sweet album, \\"Sweetlife\\" from 2003. In October 2006, Scott staged a performance of AS Sweet to help save his home town football team, which was experiencing serious financial difficulty.<br /><br />Steve Priest resides with his family in Los Angeles, CA. He has published his autobiography \\"Are You Ready Steve?\\" which was a raw expose of his time with Sweet and in 2006 released \\"Priest's Precious Poems\\", a CD of tracks largely comprised of his more recent material.<br /><br />Rock on!

B000HBKCDC|5.0|I am a huge fan of Sarah McLachlan and was very excited to hear that she was releasing a Christmas cd.  This cd was worth the wait.  Her song selections are perfect and the cd has a very ethereal/angelic sound.  Once again, Sarah has outdone herself.  This is now one of my favorite Christmas cd's.
B000J103X4|3.0|This album is good dont get me wrong...but some things are lacking in it...sounds to much like Dre to begin with and The Game is waaaaay to cocky whenever i hear him spout his little verses how hes one of the greatest makes me wanna kill myself..how can this guy say hes on the same level as Tupac biggie and nas??? This is absurd to even ponder this....This album is worth burning but not buying in my opinion Games gotta step it up if he can cause hes not even close to nas but not to many other rappers out there who can compete with Game either just shows you how much rap is goin down the toilet.All in all album is decent
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Bought this DVD for my daughter for Christmas ! She LOVES it !! Excellent movie !
0375831002|4.0|Based upon a recommendation I offered The Book Thief as a possible choice for my book club.  At the time I did not realize that it was meant for use by younger adults.  Well, it sure didn't matter to us.   <br /> <br />To immediately discover the identity of the narrator was chilling.  The characterizations were cleverly done.  The language was rich and engulfing.  The Book Thief was cleverly written using a variety of styles.  It created another picture of the Holocaust; through children's eyes.  My only reason not to give it 5 stars was that the ending for me was a bit disappointing.  Well worth the read, nonetheless.
B00097DX3U|2.0|First off I must state I was never a huge fan of Rage or Soundgarden.  However....I loved the first Audioslave CD.  It was one of the best albums I had heard in years.  But there is something wrong with this CD. I can't claim it to \\"growing\\", diving into the mainstream, or experimenting.  It's just boring.  I like some of the slower songs like \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" and \\"Dandelion\\" but it's the heavy tracks that bore me.  The songs start off hard, but then they trickle down into what amounts to Cornell wooing on and on until all the songs end up blending together.  All of the tracks on here sound like B-sides from the debut album.  Who knows...maybe they are. <br /> <br />It is astounding to me that they would release \\"Be Yourself\\" as the first single.  I could understand if they were some band in fuzzy shirts created by the Disney Channel and the song was featured on an episode of Lizzy McGuire....but from the singer of \\"Black Hole Sun\\" and the band that rocked out in \\"Bulls on Parade\\"??? Why go that cliche'?   <br /> <br />It's still Audioslave, but a boring version.  If you're not already a fan skip this album and buy the third album, then go back to their debut...and if you still can't get enough....borrow this one, and then hope for the best when their fourth comes out.
B00005ASOI|5.0|I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time because I had heard so much about it, and to my relief it is a really great horror movie. It has one of the grossest murder scenes that was hard to watch, but stuff like that makes an awesome horror movie!
B000I5X81K|5.0|<br /> <br />I loved this CD     It is fresh and appealing.   He is so very talented and with his amazing voice, he can sing any kind of song.  One of the best he has done.,  Thanks, Josh
B00005R1N3|5.0|I really liked this movie. It left alot to the imagination, and that can be really scary! This is the first time I seen this movie, and I thought I had it figured out because it was an older movie, but it completely surprised me.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|As a long-time, suppressed american fan of Kylie - I've been only recently collecting a few of her DVD's - and this one is definitely on top of the list! Kylie Minogue IS THE POP QUEEN without a doubt, this live concert DVD proves it beyond a doubt! Many performers lack when \\"live and onstage\\", but Kylie is at the top of her game!<br /><br />Aside from gushing about Kylie the overall production of the concert DVD is outstanding...for american fans sitting on the fence - get this DVD, you won't regret it!

0694003611|3.0|I wanted my infant son to have all the classics, but this was just too small and \\"busy\\" for him.  This is probably most appropriate for a baby that's at least 9 months old.  There are just too many small things to look at - very young babies can't focus on the details. <br /> <br />However, it remains an excellent story and I hope to enjoy it with my son when he gets older.

B000IZJZLM|4.0|Great group,great songs. Hope they'll look forward to new ways in their style and not turn to be repetitive.
0195170776|5.0|This work is excellent in all ways except for one: the book is too heavy.  The print is large enough for the more mature eye, the accompanying cd rom is great as well, the material quite encompassing.  But to get the book off the shelf for a quick exercise it more than muscle building! It is not what one would call a collegiate edition of a  dictionary.  Younger people may have not problem with the weight concern, but the more mature user may well be put off by the shear weight.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|This is definitely another Il Divo album to add to any fans collection. <br />Their voices are clean, crisp and the renditions of the songs <br />are wonderful
0440238609|5.0|Because of my age, (54), I started out slowly in this work. I have read so many great action adventures over my life and this one became a page turner. This audience for this work is probably late elementary through middle school. The author creates a beautiful possibility and coming of age journey. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in contemporary fantasy.
0618680004|5.0|An excellent, penetrating analysis of the fallacious basis of all religions, with a presentation of his theory as to why religiosity seems to permate all cultures, and what can be done to free mankind from this seemingly-eternal curse.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is a great box set and a great movie. I recommend it.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Buy this record. You will not be let down. If you find this record doesn't have enough heart and soul for you, then you must be in a coma. Broken Boy Soldiers certainly woke me out of mine.     The record is by no means a rip off of a White Stripes record. But Jack White's talent is intentionally drawn all over this project. Some songs are really sweet and mellow, while others are powerful homages to rock anthems of the 60s and 70s. \\"Hands\\" and \\"Steady As She Goes\\" are good examples of this. The title track is an amazingly creative song with spooky vocals and guitar work by Mr. Jack.     I had the chance to see the Raconteurs live this year when they opened for Bob Dylan. I'm talking power chords that filled the stadium. The kind that hit you in your gut and spread out through your veins like a warm ray of sunshine. Jack hopped around stage and made guitar changes in the middle of songs with such grace and energy. It was like watching a ballet.
B000FIMG68|5.0|<br />I don't mind watching these repeatedly.  Beautifully shot, suspensful, intellectually stimulating, it's great to see \\"smart\\" TV shows as opposed to tripe like American Idol and most American comedies.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This film makes me cry every time I see it.  It's beautifully animated with a haunting musical score.  Watching this movie has become part of our holiday tradition.  I highly recommend thi short film. <br /> <br />your pal, <br />Beadle
B00000J7S8|4.0|Diana Krall is the best.  There has never been a sexier, sultrier voice.  This CD does not disappoint.  She continues to get better and better.  I'd have given it 5 stars, but Live in Paris is her all time best.
B000I5X81A|2.0|I've enjoyed the guitar playing of both Clapton and Cale for many years and immediately ordered thier new joint cd when I first saw it advertised. <br />It was not what I expected and was disappointed at the laid back style of the entire cd. No hard rock feel to it at all. No songs that stand out or have a chance at immortality. Pretty routine effort. I think these guys are way past their prime.
B0002XNSY0|1.0|This is a great movie, but if you really want to see it get the older version!  There is a 'faked' letterbox in the 40th anniversary edition where the top and bottom of the picture have been trimmed off to make it look letterboxed - really a bad idea here as this is such a visual movie.  If you want to see what Kubrick intended, don't waste your money on this edition.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|This is one of Dylan's best (and that covers a lot of brilliant/groundbreaking/legendary stuff!). <br /> <br />His voice is aged, not mellowed, his lyrics still an inspiration. <br /> <br />First rate players all around. <br /> <br />Can't get this out of my CD player!
0385512058|5.0|The book changed my perception of networking. i always thought networking was about helping myself get up the ladder but Keith put it very practically and efficiently. The best part is that he has a good sense of humour and his way of writing is easy to read and follow. it is as if i can connect and relate with him. <br />Being a guru is not of much use if your book is not understood by the general average person who is going to purchase the book. Keith has done a good job and i can remember his points and ways perfectly and can even put them to good use immediately! <br /> <br />Thanks Keith.

0684824906|5.0|This book is a better study of leadership than all of the tomes written by so-called experts on the subject.  It offers new insights into Lincoln's genius- pretty amazing given all of the literature on the subject.  After reading this book, you wonder whether any other person alive at the time could have held the union together.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I cannot describe how great it was to listen to Dire Straits again.  I am a product of the 1970's and 1980's and can remember high school days filled with Dire Straits.  The singing has never been something I would consider as a classic, but the instruments and the uniqueness of the songs is what has always stood out for for me!  If you would like to enjoy some of the sounds of the 1970's and 1980's this CD is one for you!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I initially got interested because of \\"Knights of Cydonia\\", after listening to the all songs, I started to enjoy the complete album and eventually went back to listen \\"Absolution\\" (2004) \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" does have much more electronics and sound a bit different from their previous work. And even each song sounds different within the album! Overall, a great band with great songs!
B00005MP58|5.0|I've watched all of the different versions of Pride and Prejudice, and this one is my favoite.  Because it is a longer version, there is much more depth and you hear more lengthy conversations between the characters.  The scenery and settings are beautiful, and the actors do a marvelous job.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This movie delivers on multiple levels: intricate plot, relevant to current times, great action, suspense, even touches of comedy and romance.  Fits well in a collection along side the Matrix Trilogy, plus the best of the comic book - movie adaptations.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Excelent tv show, with a lot of extras that makes you enjoy getting scared.I can watch it thousand times and I get scared all of them.
B000JVT092|4.0|It's a no brainer if you have an HD DVD player! Even at 1080i it looks and sounds great...
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm the ultimate Beatle freak and was leary of buying what I figured to be a re-hashed assortment of their hits.  Boy was I surprised.  All I can say is WOW!  George Martin (and his son) are absolute geniuses and the resulting \\"LOVE\\" cd is phenominal.  When you have access to mass quantities of the finest recordings from the greatest rock group that has ever graced the planet (and probably ever will) coupled with the best producer/engineer of all time you get a cd that desrves to be played over and over and over again.....and believe me, that's just what you'll do.
0060723513|5.0|An Excellent book! Every Australian, actually every person should read this. White people should read it to help understand Native culture and Natives should read it if they feel they are losing connection to their heritage.
B000H5U832|5.0|My 16 year old daughter wanted this movie because she enjoys it so much!  This movie is for \\"young and old\\" alike.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Simply perfect. The sound quality is great and the music itself is wonderful. Il Divo is the greatest thing to come along in a very long time. If you like romantic music, this is the CD for you.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time 3 years ago. And I waited for it to come back on tv and it never did. So when I looked on Amazon and saw it I went crazy and ordered it. When I got home I got in the bed and watched it again. I tell you I fell in love with the movie all over. I love how Barbra tells us the background during the making of the movie. It would be nice if all dvd's did this. I really enjoyed. This is must have.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|simply outstanding...how did I miss this in 2002? Easy! I no longer watch network television.....oh well.....you know....you feel a sense of loss when the final episode plays....you people who have watched this know what I mean....then! the movie serenity (outstanding) ground salt into an already open wound....knowing we might not ever see this again? To overboard you ask? nah....escape and other worlds keeps us sane in our lives.....
B000ASSDVA|5.0|This product was received on time in good condition. It's inspirational for me. The cast brings the story alive.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|Being a climatologist for 20 years I bit the bullet and watched the movie. Politics and science have no place in bed together. and that is just what this movie is. a political agenda. Sorry, the earth goes thru climate cycles every so often, Either on a micro or macro level....what would Mr. Gore have called the great ice age? What would Mr. Gore have called the great dust bowl of the 30's? Gobal warming? It's a nice movie, nice visuals and landscapes......but proving science? no. Remember, the earth is 72% water, 72% carbon and oxygen! The earth lives and dies because of water content.....not because of us. If Gore is right...we are dead, with no chance of fixing the problem. The fix doesn't exist to make a difference in our dying. 100 years of industrial revolution does not make 10,000,000 years null and void.
B0001907DA|5.0|The product was not only delivered in good time and condition, the product contents constitute what I want to christen \\"great relaxant.\\" Each time I want my thoughts to be totally devoid of the stress of the moment, I play any of the complete collection. I strongly recommend it for anybody that has not seen it. It adds to the beauty of a perfect library.
B00004YRQA|2.0|The Sony Playstation 2 Memory Card (8MB) works great, it's a fine product. <br />But what I did not appreceiate, was the $20.00 shipping and handeling charge that accompanied it, THAT was insane. It doesnt even weigh very much at all, yet to get it here was like a sock in the stomach. OUCH!! THANKS alot Amazon! Grrrrrrrrr <br />Sincerely, MY - LANTA!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This product, form the same artist, is a combination of music of all time.
B000005HDT|5.0|When this recording was first introdused critics laughed and downplayed this album, Just to prove and show that some critics are sometime way OFF. This was the best selling album on \\"Blue Note\\"  and is a NOW criticly aclaimed masterpiece.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This is a product for all time. You don't have to belong to the era it was made to enjoy this masterpiece.
1594481717|4.0|The outline described by Daniel Pink is something everybody with children needs to know.  Its an extrapolation of something that has always been in effect.  If you pay attention and figure out what is really going on, you can claim the future.  More today this is the truth with population growth and technology on the cutting edge, his futuristic and present scenario are really of the human heart.  What really counts is the extraordinary, the ordinary will always be of the masses.   The read is very interesting and and if one seeks out examples of what he presents, the thesis is made.
0790731452|5.0|We have two children, age 4 and 7, and decided this movie was a little too violent and scary for them to watch. Our children are home-schooled and therefore, a little more sheltered than the average child. I'm pretty sure we have friends with same-aged children who would let them watch this. HOWEVER, overall, this movie was very entertaining. We love the actors in it and were very entertaining by the whole thing.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Awesome series. I was really sad to see it end. Now I can watch it whenever I want and have extra material to boot! Well worth the money,but if you are a West Wing fan like I am, you already know that!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I highly recommend this show, though I don't know what your tastes are like. Each episode is like a forty-five minute horror movie, but the difference is this: I really don't like horror movies. I LOVE Supernatural. I've watched every episode several times and am not even close to tired of it. The stories are interesting, the writers and actors do a great job of keeping up the dynamic between Dean and Sam, and the guest stars are always well-cast. I have a strong urge to buy the second season, but it isn't out yet.<br /><br />Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles do much of the work to make the show fun to watch. (Not diminishing the work of the directors or creators...) They have a certain brotherly chemistry that is perfect for the show, and they both have a talent for the contrasting comedic and serious tones that tend to inhabit most episodes, if not every. Once in a while I note the delivery of a particular line that is just perfect, that another actor might not have done. Jared and Jensen also perform the action well, which also pops up in every episode - maybe several times. And (come on, it has to be said) they are very pleasant to look at. Wink.<br /><br />In terms of DVD features, they're pretty good. I always wish there were more commentaries, but the ones they included are good, so I won't complain. The behind the scenes features are informative and usually fairly interesting. A few of the deleted scenes are quite worth watching, and the gag reel has several hilarious moments. Good extras, all in all. In conclusion, yes, buy it!
0060934913|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is endlessly entertaining in this recounting on his develpment into a chef and behind the kitchen doors of the restaurant industry. Since reading this book I've read all of Anthony's non-fiction!!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I've loved MCR since the first time I listened to their 2nd CD Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge. When i saw that Black Parade was coming out i knew it was going to be another great CD. I pre-ordered it and waited patiently for the release. Since I've had the cd I must've listened to it a thousand times! I love every track on it! It has awesome, loud, evergetic tracks that you just want to jump around to, like House of Wolves and Famous Last Words. And then it has less upbeat, ballads that really get you withthe lyrics, like Cancer and Disenchanted. This is most definately one of the best CD's I've ever bought! GET IT!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I just recently got this CD and it hasn't been out of my player since.  I've always been a fan of Emmy Lou and Dire Straits and this collaboration is perfect.  It is simply beautiful music.
B000A88F22|4.0|my g/f loves britney spears. so she watched the show, and then just had to have the dvd.<br /><br />whatever, maybe it'll become a collectors item since they are devorced now!
B000BYA5GE|4.0|This movie is ok. I like Nicholas Cage and he made the movie for me, but I can see why it wasn't a box office smash!
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This is a great version of the movie.  If you're a fan of the movie then you should definitely get this one.
B000AA4JMU|5.0|One of the classics.  Glad I got the DVD and sound track.  A plus for my musical library.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|I was looking for a video to listen to while using my treadmill and was totally blown away with Ms. Turner's concert.  Great production and great quality. I now find that I cannot stop exercising until I view the entire video... and the time goes by too quickly.  I never get tired of listening to it.  No performer can compare to Ms. Tina Turner!!!  (Except, maybe, Phil Collins!)
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I'm not a big Phantom fan, but wanted it for my library, and it is done well.
B000BPK2PM|1.0|If I had only known how they clean it up. I purchased three albums all clean versions for my 11 year old son that loves SOAD and I had stopped listening around him due to the language. The clean version just blanks out most of the offensive word but any one listening knows what they said. <br />Not very happy but not sure what I expected.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Nothing is better than hearing Diana sing, and put her own style on holiday favorites.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I bought the movie because when I saw it in the theater I knew it was one I would watch more than once.<br /><br />Ordering through Amazon was great because I saved money and it arrived quickly.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is the best that the Eagles have ever sounded!  I've been trying to get the CD version of \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" for months.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|In the typical barbarian blood & guts fashion \\"Red Sonja\\" is a movie well worth purchasing and adding to your collection.
0618680004|4.0|It is a good book, well researched with a lot of humor.  It basically is a rebuttal of traditional Christianity, and does not take into account more current religious thought.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This movie was a total surprise the first time I saw it.  I kept expecting the worst, but it proved to be not only heartwarming but the acting was superb.  I highly recommend it and have sent several to soldiers as gifts.
1881273156|5.0|Don't think of them as just love languages because they are the same languages used friendships and family relationships.  It is really about understanding people and why they act the way the do.
B00005BKZJ|4.0|From beginning to end, I enjoyed this movie.  The quirky characters and their interaction had me smiling and Jack Palance is marvelous.  I bought several copies to send as gifts and one for myself.
0972169504|1.0|100% of the other reviews are most likely from grad students attending Leland Stanford Jr. College. If you are not in that category of the struggling in need of ego-stroking, then you probably won't be interested. Firstly, it is not funny. After a few pages we get it: grad students are overworked, tired, poor, starving, and mostly geeks seeking dates. How is that different than the life of undergrads? Ok, grad students have an awkward relationship with professors (who don't even know their names and use them as slaves) and under-grads (who consider them authority figures) which gives the grad students an odd mental complex. No much real humor here. Unless you count references to how supposedly great the weather is presumably in Palo Alto which is not really that good compared to southern California. If you expect actual humor, you won't find it in this. Flame on if you must, but you know this it true. <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I was amazed at how much I learned watching this video. I purchased a 2nd for my son-in-law who is a teacher. His department is planning to incorporate it into the curriculum at his high school.
0743289412|3.0|I'm just about through this book, and so far, it's a disappointment. It seems as if Steven K. is trying too hard, and has gotten way too introspective in this story. <br /> <br /> In the earlier King books, there were gems on every page. Single sentences that were observations about life. Plain and simple philosophy that starkly illustrated the human condition. In \\"Lisey's Story,\\" I have found only three \\"keepers,\\" worthy of mention. That is a sad commentary for an author that has given me so many years of pleasurable reading.  <br /> <br />I have read every book by Steve, and I will beg, borrow, or buy used every new book he writes, because historically.......just when I give up on him, the old magic reappears. The \\"Dark Tower Epic,\\" is a case in point. Some of those chapter were the best ever written. Some of them were boring as hell, and a waste of time to sit down with. Taken overall, I wouldn't have missed \\"The Dark Tower,\\" for the world. In summary, \\"Lisey's Story,\\" is no \\"Rose Madder.\\"
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I had the good fortune to see this spectacular stage show in London thanks to my partner. We both thought it an excellent show and so purchased the soundtrack. <br />Its strange but I came away from the production thinking there was only one stand out song, the excellent flying without gravity. How wrong I was. <br />This album grows and grows on you. I keep playing it constantly and have not yet failed to be moved to tears by Idina Menzel's breathtaking voice, especially on the track I'm not that girl. <br />Go see the stage show, go buy the soundtrack. If you are like me you will buy the book it is based on. You are in for a very special treat. <br />So put the coffee on and sit back. Turn up the stero and journey back to Oz. You will not be disapointed.
B000H5U832|5.0|Great, we bought this for our grandchildren at Christmas, but Grandma and I previed it. <br /> <br />This is great family entertainment for any age. <br /> <br />Well done, great characters (including those doing voice overs), and just pure fun to watch, not trying to teach or moralize every minute. <br /> <br />We really hope to see more and more shows, not necessarily animations either in the future. <br /> <br />
B00006I53S|5.0|This replaces a Canon 18-55mm normal lens. I need a little more latitude for distance than wide angle. this is a superior lens.
B0009K7RES|5.0|To hear Mark in a live setting really gives you the sense of the power of this talent. The recording is crisp and deep. Immaculate as well as spontaneous, Mark delivers his collection of songs with passion, integrity and even a touch of humor. A trail blazer for more then 30 years, Mark's talent is seemingly, like great wine, only sweetening and deepening with age! Bravo Mr. Knopfler!
0380729407|5.0|It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The whole family is hooked on V. Mars.  We will be so sad if it doesn't go beyond Season 3
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I remember this movie as a child and thought my daughter would love it....well she did.  She already knows most of the songs and would watch it over and over again if I let her.  It is a cute movie that can be enjoyed by all families. It is a great musical and is very fun to watch. I still remember all the songs and I saw it the first time 20 years ago!!
B0002W18MU|5.0|This is great music from an old, weak, near-death artist.  The fact that Johnny knew he was near the end makes this album very poignant and, at times, heartbreaking.  <br /> <br />He wears his faith in God on his sleeve, but the music never seems preachy.  He comes across as a man expressing his views, not trying to convince the listener of his beliefs.   <br /> <br />Some songs, like \\"Four Strong Winds\\", a Neil Young classic, and \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" by Gordon Lightfoot, are songs we have heard hundreds of times, but they seem new and fresh with new meaning sung by this Cash.  And you will be in tears by the end of \\"On the Evening Train\\", a Hank Williams song, knowing that this song about a man seeing off his wife's casket was sung soon after Johnny said good-bye to June. <br /> <br />I love all of Johnny Cash's music, beginning with \\"Hey Porter\\", but the American series, especially this one, really stick in my heart. <br />
1895565669|5.0|Excellent book.  I highly recommend this book to read to your kids.  I bought one for each of mine and personalized it to give as a Christmas present. Great way to show them and tell them you will truly love them forever.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I love the American series, but III thru V took awhile to get used to.  I and II are excellent and feature Johnny in full voice, but he begins to weaken with III and doesn't have much left by V.  His voice is so different than what is was for the first 40 years of his career that, at first, it was like listening to a different singer.  But after several listens, to the music and words, I found myself singing these songs in my head at all hours of the day and night.   <br /> <br />To me, this shows Johnny Cash as a true artist.  His music is a reflection of who he is, what he thinks, what he feels.  This is an older, weaker Cash, closer to the end of his life than the beginning.  The album opens with \\"The Man Comes Around\\", complete with bible quotations about The Judgement, then goes into \\"Hurt\\", a song about drug addiction that Cash makes his own by expanding the message to a statement about the regrets of his life.  \\"In My Life\\", a song written by a young John Lennon, takes on a mew meaning sung by an old Johnny Cash. <br /> <br />This is great music that stick with you for a long time.  Highly recommended.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|If Kiedis mentions California whether in a song or a song title one more goddamn time I'm gonna force feed him fish tacos until his motherfcuking stomach bursts and spills toxic effluvia throughout his chest cavity. On top of that the music is lame with nary a hint of the old sweatsocked Chili Peppers energy in evidence. I'm glad I stole this cd from my girlfriend's baby daddy cause my job at the All American Burger just doesn't pay enough money for me to waste it on these bolillos.
0143057375|5.0|Excellent. Must have.  Very organized and easier to follow that other works.  This seems to put it all together what I have heard in just pieces before.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|X-3 was good but could have been better.  I'm in line with those tired of 70% CG and 30% acting films to be honest.  Sure, Famke and Hugh were great but too much 'tension' and not enough action and intrigue left me waiting for Magneto to return as indicated in the last three seconds of the film.  The redeeming points in my opinion.  I like X Men, my kids do as well, but this one left something to be desired.  Next!...
B00005JNS0|5.0|This DVD is great. I got one to give for a gift and we got one too.
074356619X|4.0|I have The Secret DVD and it's great. The auduiobook is more detailed and I listen to it in my car all the time. <br />It reinforces the things learned in the DVD. <br />The only negative I could say is that Ms.Byrne has a very strong Australian accent.
B000I0QK74|5.0|The good news is the CD \\"James Taylor at Christmas\\" is a great product. <br />The bad news is that I received the package on January 4th 2007 (after Christmas) even though I ordered it on December 1st 2006.  The US Post Office stinks when it comes to package deliveries.  Amazon gave me a tracking number to follow up on it, but the tracking reports were late in arriving and no help to get the USPS to find it.  There should be a better way to ship small packages for a reasonable price.  Next time, I will use iTunes and download the music.
0060254920|5.0|Doesn't require my review.  C'mon, it's off the hook Maurice Sendak.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This album full of topsongs is a pleasure to listen too. <br />Every song is a daimond. In the past i bought the album as a lp disk. Now i had to buy it as a cd. I have noticed that my childeren like the music to. <br />My son of 23 years old put the album on his i-pod after hearing it. <br /> <br />Its a real classic.
0156027321|5.0|The book is fantastic in every way. It is a shockingly beautiful allegory, a harrowing adventure tale, a heartbreaking coming of age novel, and a lovely, if unconventional, romance.
0060794410|5.0|This book is built upon the data collected through researching some of the most impressive companies ever to make the fortune 500, yet it turns out that the book is applicable to any organization (or any individual for that matter), seeking to be the best they can possible be.  It's not a Christian book but at the helm of each of these companies is a \\"level 5 leader\\" .  This leader weather Christian or not consistantly exhibits a Christ like mannar in humility and drive.
B00005JGAF|4.0|I bought this album because I owned it approx 30 years ago and had a vague memory of it being good. I was not dissappointed, in fact it seems to have improved with age, or maybe my taste has. Whichever is the case Rocket to Russia is in my humble opinon the best ever Ramones album. Cretin Hop is an all time classic not to mention Teenage Lobotomy, Sheena is a Punk Rocker and the best ever version of Surfing Bird. there are also 5 ripper bonus tracks. Long live the Ramones.
6305736650|5.0|The greatest movie of my lifetime.  It could not be better.  If you watch it several times the humor in parts of it just keep popping out.  Such acting by the players is rarely seen.
B000F8O35U|5.0|When this movie first came out, I saw it in the theater and it immediately became a favorite.  I was a junior in high school (blush) but even now as an adult and a mom, I still love this movie and that I can share it with my daughters.  It's a timeless story, with wonderful music.  My only concern is that now, as a mother, I notice the scariness of Ursula, the Sea Witch, more than I did as a non-mother.  My 6 yr old immediately decided upon seeing and hearing Ursula that she was bad, and was anxious whenever she came into a scene.  It was a little disconcerting to see her agitated like that, but with some discussion, she's fine.  If you've never seen the movie or your child has never seen it, make sure they're OK during the Ursula scenes.  And be aware that there's a literally explosive death scene near the end, where Ursula is jabbed by a boat's sharp front and she explodes into chum.  I hadn't remembered it being quite that \\"graphic\\" and again, had to reassure my 6 yr old that mean old Ursula wasn't going to hurt anyone again.
B000JBWWBK|4.0|This really was a delightful, upbeat, lighthearted movie wrapped in a beautiful package of \\"Provence\\" wrapping paper and the music accompany this film matches that upbeat gift with a soundtrack that is quirky and fun. Memories will come washing back over you from amazingly creative places! Covering classic crooning oldies from the U.S., a little bit of Country twang, classic Nilson Rock and Roll from England and wistfully playful French diddies, it's a feast for your ears and a banquet for retro memories! I find myself smiling every time I listen to it. A creatively odd and very pleasant blend of upbeat fun.
0060776757|5.0|U2, never to say about them nobody has already said. And a book which has been managed by themself has to be in all music library of any music lover. <br /> <br />I think it is been my best music purchasing of all music stuff got.
B00005ASOI|5.0|Suspiria is a great movie for anyone who enjoys horror flicks but it is also a beautiful movie. The artistic sensibility in the film is amazing and if you don't like horror but are interested in interiors and set this film takes the cake. Supposedly it has one of the most violent murder scenes of all time, however, my sensibilities might be jaded. It is indeed brutal but surrounded by such lushness that you find your heart racing at the same time you appreciate what is on screen. I am not a slasher fan but I love this movie.  <br />The other terrific scene occurs with the blind man walking his dog at night -- I don't want to ruin the movie but watch for it.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I was very please at the quick shipment, so I didn't have to worry about it being in time for Christmas.
B000056Q81|4.0|Had her music in phonograph format collection. Compare audio quality from CD and my record player showed very similiar which indicated high quality reproduction. Recomment to anyone whose interest in it.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|continuum is definitely worth buying. john mayer does not let you down on this cd. it's very soothing and if you like his first two cd's youre going to love this one. im so excited to see him in concert now.
0060899190|4.0|Good book, although it seems to be a \\"read once\\" type of thing. I plan on passing it along to friends now that I have looked at it. 4 stars because it does have a lot more content compared to 2nd released book.
B000BTC5LW|2.0|The only band member who gets any kind of footage is Gilmour. There are fleeting glimpses of others, but the editing is edgy and rather amateurish. I'm sure the light show was most spectacular at the event, but hours of footage of crowds wandering about and the band in the far distance soon becomes boring. Sound is good, but extras and of little value.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Just a masterful myster/suspense/thriller.  Did you like Christian Bale in Batman Begins, American Psycho, or Equilibrium?  Well, you'll love him in The Machinist.  One of the best physical transformations ever (Bale losing lots of weight), but loses none of his acting skills.  After seeing more and more of Bale's films, he becomes the same person over and over again.  This will be the movie that separates from all his other characters once everything is said and done.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I am a big fan of the old classic disney films, Snow White, Cinderella, Pinnocchio, etc..., and don't care too much for the recent Disney movies where the characters are drawn almost exactly the same from one movie to the next (Hercules, Atlantis, Emperor's New Groove, etc...). For a more recent Disney flick, I consider this to be one of the best. The characters are well thought out, the story line is great, and the songs original. This is a very good movie that your kids will ask to watch over and over, and adult fans of Disney will love as well.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|Very artistic film dealing with the surreal and dream state.  You know how it's always hard to describe what happens in your dreams?  It seems like one thing lead to another and the two are completely unrelated some times.  That's exactly what happens in this film, but all will make sense at the end.  I especially appreciate the creative and original scene-transitions.
140003180X|4.0|If you liked the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency you will enjoy the Kalahari Typing School for Men.  Smith maintains his characters, and yet especially in this one expands on the character development of the assistant detective, Mma Makutsi.  As in all books in this series, I feel like I am in Botswana when I read these books.
B000067CZY|5.0|The product was as described, reasonably priced and delivered quickly.  And, I must rave about the movies themselves as they were great.  One and two are the best (in that order).  I felt the third one was a bit weak compared to the the other two.  Can't go wrong on this.
