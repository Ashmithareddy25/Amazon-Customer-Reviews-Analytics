B009KHCT94|5.0|I dabble in 3D animation, with a lean toward scifi and steampunk.  They are both here in spades, and very well done.  But of course a movie needs a good story, and that's here, also, with a heavy dose of humor and parody.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|VERY addictive game and would definitely recommend it to any mystery lover! HONESTLY loved this game! Only downfall was it was a bit too short and maybe a tad bit expensive for full game...
B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|I did not read the book but I can tell you that the screen writer did a great job, especially in the dialogue. Her boyfriend had the best script and was very natural in his acting. He did get the most &#34;playful&#34; role and it was obvious he enjoyed his dialogue and the part he played. Had me laughing a lot, the two of them. Sacrifice, compromise,  and justice were all given their due, along with a hopeful ending. Opal
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I really enjoyed this director's cut version of the movie. The scenes that were added back help round out the Terminator's background, tell more about the designer who unwittingly laid the groundwork for his creation, and explain the overall situation more thoroughly. The original version was 108 minutes, and this version 154 minutes - so nearly an hour more to see. This is my preferred version of the movie, and I think it will be, too, for most Terminator fans.
B00CTT9646|1.0|I admit I am hardcore Trekkie, a hardline fan, for me Star Trek is part of my life, not just watch a movie occasionally or a vague memory, because of that I know with certainty that Star Trek has always been something more than special effects , explosions and screams, I am also aware that times change, and the need to adapt to market needs, perfect, I understand that.<br />But I will never accept the lack of creativity, of people like Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (writers) who along with JJ Abrams (director)has not only departed from what Star Trek had meaning since its origin but in fact destroyed it in just 4 years and with only two films. I think they can do something better, not just copying what already exists, put two or three touches and voila! That's not an homage to the old movies, is a desecration I think JJ Abrams an company can put all the special effects they want, and all the explosions they want, and all the screaming and fuss , but TELLING AN ORIGINAL STORY is that to much to ask??? think about this, what can we expect from the upcoming films? or the next TV series if that were the case? the same episodes,??? the same scripts we already know???? only one or two different things to fit in that so-called alternate time line????? Are we so mediocre as the public that we can not demand new stories??? If the whole damn thing will be only to copy what already exist (arguments and scripts) to make them compatible to the \\"temporal alternate line\\" then Star Trek is really dead, is dead and we don't want to accept it . Really I rather see the franchise dead, that to be looking the next 20 years all movies and episodes of the original series \\"recycled\\" . So words of introduction should then change to \\"boldly go where others have already been before,\\" That's my opinion, thanks for allowing me to expose, greetings from Starfleet command Guatemala. USS Tikal \\"to bodly go where no man has gone before\\"

1449433251|5.0|Great set - but I purchased for dear friends' kids since they are C&H nut-cases......well Mom & Dad won't let them drag the books out to giggle over during cereal-munching for fear of damage, ferchrissake.  So I missed the mark of giving the kids extra yucks whenever they wanted thanks to Omni-Mom.  Not the fault of publisher or Watterson, of course....but be careful when buying complete collections that they don't become bookshelf-only (later yardsale) items.  Nice set, uncertain audience.

0316069884|5.0|I have two pet pigs, who live in my house and are trained just like dogs, and who are my best friends. I bought this book to get more education on factory farming to be able to tell my friends and family hard facts instead of just emotional rants. It worked. I bought 3 copies of this book already for my family and friends and have been passing them around. If you want to get educated, with an actual interesting read, I highly recommend this book. Also, pigs are the best! But do your research before buying one. They do NOT STAY SMALL, \\"teacup\\" pigs are not real, but full grown they are still the size of a medium sized dog and are the best pets I have ever had.

1402793375|5.0|Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee; An Indian History of the American West.<br /><br />I did not want to read this book.<br />Through every chapter of gory descriptions of the slaughter and humiliation of Native American women and children, I clenched my teeth to hold back tears. At certain boiling points, I broke. To say that I &#34;wept uncontrollably&#34; would be a cliche understatement. But how else would I describe it?<br /><br />I'm sure many white settlers felt justified in their actions toward this race. I came to the realization that most cruel people (and people, in general) think they are good with honorable intentions.<br /><br />They &#34;do what is right in their own eyes&#34;.<br /><br />I'm sure they thought they were protecting other white settlers from savage attacks. And I am certain they were somewhat right in their estimation.<br /><br />However, the greed for power and land was an overwhelming reason for most of the suffering.<br /><br />The Native Americans were a mere inconvenience to them. They needed to be &#34;aborted&#34;.<br /><br />It is one thing for a pioneer to protect his own family from hostilities. It is a whole different matter for an army with leaders like General Sherman (who was previously known for his criminal March to the Sea involving innocent civilians during the Civil War) to eradicate whole tribes to aquire more land.<br /><br />The utter disregard for life sickened me.
0810989956|5.0|My son has the entire series of these books, so of course when this came out he wanted this one too. He is enjoying reading and filling in the blanks to personalize the book. I am just glad that he's reading and enjoying it! It was well priced on amazon as well. Good buy all in all.
B0092AKDQK|4.0|The first reviewer, Ivor Zetler, has written an excellent review. As he notes the tempos in some of the music can be on the brisk side. In many of the compositions this works very well. The Mendelssohn piano trio, the Beethoven String Trios, and the Frank piano quintet all are excellent performances. In the Schubert string quintet it does not work as well. Heifetz and Piatigorsky are both wonderful musicians. In addition there are  many other excellent musicians included in these recordings. This includes Primrose on the viola and Pennario and Lateiner on the piano. I wish that Rubinstein, Heifetz, and Piatigorsky had recorded more together. The Mendelssohn trio recording is wonderful. Full of passion and fire. The Ravel piano trio is also a very good performance At the costs of these CDs, this box is  really a wonderful bargain. It contains a lot of great chamber works in good to great performances with wonderful artists. If you are new to chamber music it is a good place to start exploring the repertoire.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Is needed to read this book. It was amazing. It was hard at times to keep Hannah and clay distinguished when they were both narrating, but knowing both of their feelings and thoughts on the matter made it so much better. I also enjoyed how sarcastic Hannah was when she was talking about the experiences because that really showed me how at peace she was with killing herself and also showed how much faith she lost towards the end. I felt like it made it much more depressing and for me, just heartbreaking. I loved it and it was also a great reminder that we need to think about our actions. Everything affects everything.

B005LAII80|3.0|I came into this film from the perspective of a long time Judge Dredd fan dating back to 1983 with his run in Eagle comics.. When I saw the 1995 film I didn't walk out of it hating it but I saw huge room for improvement. In particular I was disturbed by the removal of his helmet and the addition of his wacky sidekick played by Rob Schneider. Dredd 3D corrects a lot of the problems of the previous film but then introduces all new ones.<br /><br />My concern started with the opening pan shot of Mega City One. This was not Mega City. Mega City is a massive densely populated supercity that spans the entire east coast with enormous mile high buildings. What I saw here was a rather ordinary looking city with the occasional CGI superskyscraper doting the landscape. Dredd 3D had a modest $45 million budget, half the cost of the 1995 film, but $45 million isn't chump change. The action scene that starts the film is small and forgettable and banks on the vicious way that Dredd kills the criminal to sell itself.<br /><br />If I were to describe the Judge Dredd comic in just one word it would be satirical. If I were to describe Dredd 3D in just one word it would be gritty. My second choice would be violent. Despite its many flaws the 1995 film was correct to never take itself too serious. Judge Dredd is big, bold and over the top. Dredd 3D feels small and grim. There is a fan made video on YouTube called Judge Minty that actually does a better job of recreating Judge Dredd on what I assume is a miniscule budget. That is not to say Judge Minty is better. It suffers from the same problem as most fan made movies which is a forgettable plot and amateurish acting but the uniforms and Dredd's Lawmaster look much better.<br /><br />The producers of Dredd 3D made the correct albeit obvious decision to keep his helmet on the whole movie but then ended up radically changing the rest of the uniform. It's hugely toned down to give it a more realistic look but again I think the producers miss the point of Judge Dredd. The comic book costume is ridiculous but that was the intent. The oversized shoulder pads, knee pads and elbow pads are a reflection of the over the top nature of the comics. The point of the comic wasn't to make Judge Dredd the world's biggest bad ass. It's about social commentary and irony. There is the irony of this machine like judge dressed in an incredibly outlandish, non utilitarian uniform. Dredd 3D nails the look of the helmet but besides that the 1995 film does a much better job. Well, except for the bizarre metal codpiece.<br /><br />Judge Dredd holds an 18% on Rottentomatoes while Dredd 3D has an enviable 78%. I would put both the films closer to the midway point between the two. If you want a relatively fun, violent action film with a character whose name happens to be the same as a comic character you can certainly do worse than Dredd 3D but if you want the comic Judge Dredd and his world brought to life you'll have to keep waiting. If this were a very good film but not a great interpretation of Judge Dredd I could appreciate it for what it is but there is just so little for me to latch on to. The music is unremarkable and dated. The sets feel like they're from a movie with an even smaller budget than this one and besides a few interesting moments the film just didn't make a lasting impression on me. I did appreciate the casting of Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby who were both excellent. The one weak cast member was Wood Harris whose acting resembled his name.<br /><br />I have to wonder if the very generous reviews are a reaction to the fact that this movie is so aggressively not Judge Dredd 1995. However to me it feels like they threw the baby out with the bathwater. Honestly, the 1995 film did not get everything wrong. A film that's much closer to Judge Dredd in tone would be the original Robocop would featured tons of social commentary and kept a balance between the violence and levity. Despite the favorable reviews Dredd3D was a fairly sizable bomb at the box office and I noticed that user audience reactions were slightly lower than professional reviews which is rare for an action adventures movie. If you love the film, that's cool. Support it, buy the blu-ray and if enough are bought maybe a sequel will actually be made but if you're not a reader of the comic know that this isn't just a slight alteration of the source material. Dredd 3D is a complete departure in terms of tone and unlike a character like Batman there haven't been tons of tonal shifts in Dredd throughout the years so as far as I know this is a unique interpretation and in my opinion not an improvement.3D was a fairly sizable bomb at the box office and I noticed that user audience reactions were slightly lower than professional reviews which is rare for an action adventures movie.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I did the Game of Thrones thing backwards. We watched all 3 seasons of the show before I decided to read them. I still very much enjoyed this book and am really excited to start the next one. I was very surprised to find this book pretty closely mirrored the first season of the show. I was still very into the book despite watching the show first. I definitely recommend this book.
B0013TPV0Q|3.0|Not his best by far. Seems that he is trying too hard with the same life stories and should maybe search out another niche.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The plot of this novel was amazing.  Amy truly was amazing.  She is really a psycho of the 1st degree.  I was put off by the language.  I think the author threw in a million &#34;F&#34; words that were not necessary to the storyline.  I don't understand her reasoning for that.  But otherwise it was well written.<br /><br />Do I detect a sequel coming?  The ending left me hanging.  How can anyone be so evil and go completely unpunished?

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|When people look at Star Trek, they see several versions from television to the movies.  When JJ Abrahms took the lead for the new movie series, he truly has taken the franchise where no person, or man has gone before!  Think about it, whe Captain Kirk and the crew were on T.V. it was always about him.  When the movies came, it was about the whole crew.  Next, Patrick Stewart... The next generation was about the whole crew from the beginning, which really made the franchise even better.  Fast forward to the new movies... The first is when Jim Kirk, Spock, Checkov, etc, first meet.... encounter a villian from a time-warp and succeed in defeating him.  The second movie... explains who Khan is...what a provocative move! Imagine how the next movie will phase Khan in before finally being exiled....plus possibly a new villian? This is a definite 5 plus star series of movies to come!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Touching, heartfelt, honest. I wanted to see more of Victoria at the end of the book as a mother, daughter and partner.

B00C061I3K|5.0|In a market that is ridiculously oversaturated by EDM, dubstep, and remixes, it is completely unfair for long term \\"fans\\" of Daft Punk to immediately cast Random Access Memories to the side. First off, I would like to say that I have not listened to everything that Daft Punk has done. I have heard their hit songs from previous albums and I loved the Tron: Legacy soundtrack they did. I listened to Random Access Memories on Spotify twice before going out and purchasing the physical CD version of the album. I'm the type of person who likes to give different types of music a try and, in this case, I am glad I did. This album is a fantastic throwback to the 70's disco/funk era. There aren't any songs like \\"Around the World\\" or \\"One More Time\\" on this album but there is plenty of songs for people to dance to if that is your thing. The type of songs the album lacks are the club tunes that many of the \\"fans\\" clamor for. I'm not saying that there is no room for that type of music in the world but there is more out there to appreciate than just that. I understand that some of the stuff on this album is different than that which is featured on their older albums but change is not always a bad thing. The reception of this should not be dictated on the lack of \\"beats\\" or the absence of samples. It should be dictated by the quality of the music. Daft Punk is being victimized for recognizing that the current state of music is lackluster and that the true art of creating music is being lost in this day and age. This is due to the ability for absolutely anyone being able to string together a beat and some samples and call something a song. I personally commend Daft Punk for unleashing their talent and their desire to fully create an album's worth of catchy songs using real instruments and people in a studio while also embracing the heritage of the type of music they make. If you don't like this album, you are simply not a fan of music in general and, for that, all you deserve are your overabundance of club tunes with repetitive beats and minimal creativity/artistry.
B001LOU6ZS|5.0|On UFO's 10th studio release \\"Mechanix\\", (1982), Phil Mogg, Andy Parker, Pete Way, Paul Chapman and Neil Carter put together their last great album.  Produced by Gary Lyons (who produced the first Foreigner album), he gave the band some great sounds here.  Phil Mogg just sounded so confident.  Yhis would also be bassist Pete way's last album with UFO, before heading off to Fastway (which he never played in), but he did start Waysted.  Paul Chapman gave us some more memorable riffs on this release.  I bought this one in the summer of '82 and haven't looked back after 31 years.  You get stunning rockers in, \\"The Writer\\", \\"We Belong To The Night\\", \\"Feel It\\" and the Eddie Cochane nugget \\"Somethin' Else\\", which was a hit in England, Neil Carter's sax works well on this track.  Mid-tempo rockers in, \\"Let it Rain\\", \\"Back Into My Life\\", \\"You'll Get Love\\", \\"Doing It All For You\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" and the great power ballad \\"Terri\\".  Bonus tracks include the B-side of \\"Let It Rain\\", \\"Hell Of A Stranger\\", which was probably left off due to time restraints.  And you also get 3 live numbers \\"We Belong To The Night\\", \\"Let It Rain\\" and \\"Doing It All For You\\".  After Pete Left the band, they made the surprising excellent \\"Makin' Contact\\", in 1983.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|They warn you at the beginning and its true. It's just a beautifully told story about 2 people (one in love, the other experimenting with the idea of love).<br /><br />Maybe this could be a love story for people who consider themselves realists or logical. It's definitely not one for the rom-com crowd.

John Green's writing style and clever wording continues to amazing me every time I pick up a copy or read it via the Kindle app. Definitely a 5 star worthy book that everyone should read!
B000000OAN|5.0|A genre-shattering work from a band in its prime.  Though Bohemian Rhapsody towers over the entire album, A Night at the Opera contains some oft-overlooked Queen gems such as '39, I'm in Love with my Car, and Death on Two Legs.  Only one band in the history of rock and roll could have pulled off A Night at the Opera.  Iconic in spots and terrific fun to boot!
B004SEUIXS|5.0|I am a heterosexual middle aged man. The sweetness of this French romance gets me every time.(No... There's just something in my eye!) Amelie is an enchanting woman with a tendency towards daydreaming. In spite of her own misfortunes she makes a conscious effort to improve the lives of people around her. But while she is busy caring about everyone else who cares for her? If I made a list of my top ten favorite movies this one would make it into my top five.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|What a terrific re-issue!  Although not the Beatles, Wings was a truly great band that recorded some memorable tracks.  This is both a document of that body of work and the full-on fun of 1970s arena rock shows.  Although the non-McCartney tracks aren't exactly essential, they are all competently done.  The real star, of course, is Sir Paul.  His voice still sounds young and vital.  All in all, a worthy live album and a good overview of Wings.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Every fantasy genre lover ought to see this movie. Some parts might seem to drag for viewers with short attention spans but if you dig cool scenery, creatures and magic you should enjoy this. One of the Henson Company's bests. Will happily share a shelf next to \\"Labyrinth\\" and \\"Mirror Mask.\\"
0812550706|5.0|For those wanting to just read this for the movie, I am here to tell you that this IS worth reading even if you are not planning on reading any other from the series.  BUT I bet that after you read it, you will want to read more from Card.  This was my experience.  I really love Card's writing style.  Even from the brief introduction at the beginning of the book I began to realize that.  I am now going to go through the Ender Quintet and after that the Shadow series.<br /><br />This book does involve, describe, and talk about killing/death throughout, so have that in mind when buying.<br /><br />I would recommend this to readers aged 14 all the way to 99.

I set 2 alarms, one for 5 and one for 5:20, and I had no problems with the battery on my kindle fire. I had it plugged in all night so maybe that helps(?) Overall I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a nice (FREE!) alarm clock! :) :D

I really want to thank the person who helped me with trouble shooting my problem.

0312330537|4.0|This may be one of the most difficult books I have ever had to rate.  I desperately wanted to give it 5 stars. Within the first few pages I felt as though I was deeply connected to it's characters, and filled with a strange sense of wonder and magic.  G.D.R. has a way of painting a portrait of the city with such depth and beauty that I found myself feverishly underlining and dog-earring page after page to remind myself of the beautiful prose when I needed to come back to it.<br />If I had my two cents, however, I would have ended the book after Part 3.  From the beginning of part 4 the mood changes and, for whatever reason, the magic is lost.  The prose becomes clinical and less descriptive, even though it is obvious that the author is deeply tied to the content.  One almost feels like the author himself has changed because it just doesn't carry the same mystic energy that the first three parts had.<br />By Part 5, you are hoping it will return, but it never fully recovers. All of the loose ends are tied up, but even then it seems rushed and the timeline a little unbelievable.<br /><br />All in all, it was still one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, I just wished I was left with the same achingly beautiful feeling that I began it with.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good game no glitches or problems. My only problem is paying 4.99 for such a short game however the game is good.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoyed  this book  at each level.  The author keeps your interest throughout  while describing various towns and cities in Afghanistan .  There times of such hardships and much happiness.  You gain a great understanding of the difficult life there is in many  areas including the lack of education for most and the hunger many experience.<br />The book kept my attention until I finished.<br />Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This  is a really fun game the only down side is I can not connect to my Facebook it is disappointing but other then that it's a lot of fun to play log  it
B00C061I3K|5.0|Based on buying an album by this band from earlier times, this newer release is by far superior in music quality and likability for me.<br /><br />Mush more overall listening appeal and a blast from start to finish. Crank it up and enjoy.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I thought the movie was very entertaining although the final sequences were a bit long and tedious.  I think if they had cut about 20 minutes out of the movie as a whole it would have been a lot better.
B003ZSH606|5.0|More toe tapping, turn it up loud music from Jamiroquai. No one quite like them in my opinion. Good time music even if I do not always agree with the lyrics. One of few bands who can make me want to get out of my car at a red light and dance. Best listened to on high quality stereo systems.<br /><br />Try them, you will like them.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a very nice app, it even got me to spend some money on it.  It is a shame that when the update came out I was not able to use the game.  Since I do not do Facebook, I signed in as a guest.  As a guest I am not able to update the app so now I cannot play it without starting over and losing all the money I spent.
B004SBB0LU|4.0|Queen is one of those bands from my youth who had good songs at times but I was never a rabid fan.<br /><br />This anthology helped me appreciate them more and get deeper into their body of work, especially the album, Sheer Heart Attack, my favorite of the four CD's enclosed.<br /><br />Also came with complement DVD's, which I have yet to watch at all. Overall, I am happy with the purchase.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is now one of my all-time top 10 fave books.  A thoughtful plot with detail and so well written.
0452289963|5.0|I am so impressed with this book that I told all my friends to check it out.  I will get his other books and read them too next.
B0053O89RY|5.0|The 3rd Season of Modern Family was as great as the first 2, if not better, and we just can not wait for the next season to come out!  They have one of those great combinations where all the characters & writers just &#34;Click&#34; -- nothing will EVER beat &#34;Friends&#34;, but this one will go down in that same class!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read, that kept me fully interested from start to finish.  The only reason why I gave it four stars was because I felt Gideon, and Eva's story could have easily been wrapped up in this latest Crossfire novel.  That being said, I still enjoy the struggles, and obstacles this couple faces through out the book.  I love all the characters as well, and the stay consistant through out the series.  Can't wait for the next book,  I just hope it doesn't take as long as this one to get published.
B00992CF6W|5.0|as good as minevraft but needs more updates.every thing else is dealt good though. every body who likes minevraft should get it.
B008602KQI|5.0|loved the futuristic bent to this movie and how it tells us how easy we could be controlled. Big brother is watching!
B004T0E2S8|1.0|It does not work. First it took me to a number of sites which had nothing but advertisements for various guitar related items.  When I did finally find tabs they did not show on the screen at all, I was able to somehow save the tab to a pdf and view it, however, it was a total waste of time.  I would not recommend this program to anyone.  I should not I had similar problems with GuitarTabb Tabs and Chords app.  I am using Android jellybean 4.1 on my tablet.
B009O2XY12|4.0|A mind waster for the times we would like to forget the days problems. Never forget the children, their mind is wasted every day<br />with trash. TV!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It makes you want to be in love, not at someone else, but in yourself. Worth time reading this book.
0062255657|3.0|Contains slight spoilers.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Gaiman's writing, for the most part. And his prose remains very strong in the Ocean at the End of the Lane.<br /><br />Pity the book is basically a not-very-good, watered-down version of Coraline.<br /><br />The story has a simple frame narrative.

First of all, in the initial 60 or so pages, the fantasy element feels extremely out of place. The choppiness isn't helped by the fact that the story feels like it should be middle-grade, but the author stuffed in an unnecessary frame narrative* and sex cameo to make it more adult.

He does *nothing.*)<br /><br />But all that, all of that, I could put up with if Gaiman hadn't ended the book the way he did. I once heard it said best: making your protagonist forget everything at the end is a weaselly way out.

0385342039|4.0|I will say, as addicted to retail therapy as I am, I was not a fan of \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" (and not only because the calls from bill collectors hits a little close to home for me). But something about the cover and jacket of \\"Twenties Girl\\" prompted me to give Kinsella another try and I couldn't be happier. It was a fun, light hearted read with just enough intrigue to make you want to keep reading instead of putting it down. Perfect for a sunny day at the beach.
B000ID1J0E|3.0|I guess since Johnny Depp was a friend of Hunter Thompson, his protrayal of him is probably a more accurate one, but the lunacy on the screen was way over the top. Hate being in someone else's trip.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is addicting non stop play..Very amusing and fun.I could play for hours. A thumbs up for this wonderful game
0060254920|5.0|wonderful, thinking in the time that was created. The book was politically incorrect for the time, since not show a love story too fearful while
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game to play... Challenging and a good time playing the game... Really enjoyed the game.. Only problem is it is hard to get the gut coins.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A book I had a hard time putting down. Constantly guessing, on your toes. Great book! Plan to read the rest of Gillian Flynn's books!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I liked this series immensely & couldn't get enough of it. Beautiful scenery, fantastic acting, marvelous writing, awful villains, wonderful heroes---very dream-like but it also touched on the problems of every layer of society of that time.
B000093FLA|4.0|I thought this movie was good.  The humor was a little off-beat which I liked and everyone was a great actor.  I liked the ending too.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|She will always be the Great Lady of American Singers. Once in a lifetime someone ultra-talented, head & shoulders above all others appears. That was Whitney.<br />Dissect her songs & style if you please, but better yet, just enjoy the marvelous voice with so much feeling that we have lost. A talent such as hers may never come along again.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Even my 4 year old loves this game.  Can we guess what she is building not often, but still fun!  There is a FREE phone - helper app - companion for this game on Android (and I assume iOS) that has a timer and score keeping function.  Very helpful and great value added produced by Lego.  As of this writing not in the Amazon App store so search Lego Creationary in the play store.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I really hated to see this series come to an end---the entire set was brilliantly done. Again, I loved it. My husband even watched, reluctantly at first.<br />More, please?
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|A good follow up to Before Sunrise.  Keeps ones attention throughout and leaves you with wanting more. I went to see Before Midnight the same day I watched Before Sunset!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Great game for a tablet. You can't beat the price!  Great graphics, real combat situations. I love it! Very good game!
B006HH5Y6K|5.0|Excellent, I have been a fan of marc Bolans for years and I'm continually updating my music, so glad Amazon carries the old stuff as well as what's current...
B004GYY714|5.0|Easy to install and easy to use on my Kindle Fire. Excellent selection of local, national and international radio stations as well as Internet Radio sites. It also functions directly (without downloading an app) on my laptop.
B00019074O|5.0|I watched this movie when I was younger and was glad to find it. I enjoyed watching it again but it may not be for everyone.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker is a great singer/song writer, and my wife and I look forward to his next album. We are glad he went country.
B00A2H9L2E|4.0|I liked &#34;Silent Hill:Revelation&#34;,but liked the first part of&#34; Silent Hill&#34; much better.The first half was more exciting and it had more twist and turns.I would recommend that both sequel's be seen back to back.

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love mahjong. Period. I've never been picky about how the game looks, or the choice of layouts. However, even I'm impressed with this game's options. You can choose from lovely backgrounds, 3 different sets of tiles and some hilariously inventive layouts. For sticklers of tradition though, the original layouts are there. I got this as an FAOTD, and I couldn't be happier with. I also like the fact that there are no intrusive permissions. Great game overall!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|THIS ALBUM F***ING AWESOME I WENT FOR I RIDE IN MY CAR I POPPED THAT SUCKER IN AND I STARTED JAMMING OUT
B00BTHV05M|4.0|I've only listened to it once, but I like all the tracks.  If you liked Awakening and Dreaming Out Loud, you will also like their latest release.  I'm looking forward to hearing this again.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|This movie did not hold our interest at all.  I was hopeful when I saw Ewan McGregor in it, since he is generally charming, but they sisn't give him a lot to do.  They two lead actors were pretty to look at but couldn't really even hold the rather thinly plotted story together.  Altogether pretty much a big yawn.
B00063F8B2|5.0|If you have seen the movie of Polar Express, you will love this CD in your collection. As you listen you can almost see the movie. The quality of this CD is very good.

B000002AGN|3.0|Dave Brubeck is an all time great jazz performer;however, this CD was not as great<br />as I thought it would be.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What more to say?  A beautiful story from a master story teller.  Gaiman at his best.  I only wish it was longer so I could keep reading.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|The great irony of this bad cop in Mulholland Dive getting his in the end and no recourse against the wife, is really quite fun.  In some ways as with all mystery and crime novels you can not  always be surprised by what happens and what endings are used.  This is a little predictable, but a fun read with an ironic ending.<br /><br />Dennis Endicott
B00CW665VI|5.0|Absolutely loved this incredibly funny, well-written story.  Am actually suffering withdrawal after devouring this book. Great characters, unique point of view, wonderful, relatable love story.  Also, very sexy!  Cannot wait for the next book!  Highly recommend!
B0090SI4LU|4.0|It managed to be pretty close to the book which I liked, I liked it, good acting and I will watch it again I'm sure :-)  my only complaint is I would of gotten it quicker at the store, shipping took to long

1401311083|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It was light reading and did not require a lot of concentration.  I enjoy \\"Castle\\" on TV and this book filled the gap between seasons.  Am looking forward to reading the other four.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Ever since 9-11 I've wanted to learn about Afghanistan - and I do from reading Hossini - in a way that gives me a feel for the ground - actual life there.  This book takes into account much of current history as seem and experienced by those who lived it.  A different place- for sure..  And a rough place to grow up and survive in. But with all the squalor and very bad times - Russian and then US involvement, this is the Afghani homeland - and they are a very proud people.  The political scene has it's parallels to the US - take it apart and then try to put it back together again.  Pretty much what's going on here in the USA.  Viewed from that context, very scary.

B004BCNVOA|5.0|Even though this is the explicit version of this album, the depth of the music and the raw intensity of emotion of the songs are phenomenal! This woman really knows how to paint a lyrical picture of real life in a way I haven't heard before. She brings her listeners to those very real places in life and in love!
0738711500|5.0|very helpful, exactly what I was looking for, the cards are wonderful, and the book helped me a lot..real nice
B00AFYZDL2|4.0|A solid album from front to start.  Not as good as &#34;A Call To Arms&#34;, but if you liked that album, you'll like this.  The bonus CD has some great tracks.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Very creepy, suspenseful thriller. Keeps you on your toes and you just don't know exactly how it'll all play out. All in all a fun,easy read!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I read books on an android tablet. But when I've got my laptop, I prefer to read them on a much bigger screen. This is where Kindle for Mac and PC comes in. Just make sure you don't try to swipe your screen to turn pages!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put the book down, when one book ended, had to immediately download the next.  My suggestion would be to buy the trilogy all at once.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Ordered Django for my husband because he loves Tarentino movies, and this didn't disappoint.  Lots of action and blood, but we love QT's versions of history (i.e. Inglourious Basterds).
B0073COMKW|1.0|Bought this light bulb for the garage electric door opener since it is not easy to get to and thought an LED would work for a long time.  I have two Phillips LED bulbs that have worked beautifully on nightly timers for over six months now but not the Samsung.  It quit working after the first 2 weeks.  I'm not sure the issue as many reviewers have reported bulbs that did not work but it could be that the frequent turning on and off of the bulb was too much for it.  For me, I'm going to stick with the Phillips LEDs.
030758836X|2.0|I usually don't post reviews for books (or anything else really) but I just have to comment on this one. I started reading Gone Girl a couple of months ago but couldn't really get into it and put it down after the first 20 pages or so. The book wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was great either. Then, yesterday, after browsing for new books online and seeing the good reviews this book got, I figured I'd give it another try. I got past the first few pages and actually started to like the book. The writing is fast and witty. The book consists of three parts, the first part is good. Not great, but good enough that it makes you want to keep reading to see what happened to Amy (the Gone Girl). Then the author really kicks it up a notch in part two with clever plot twists that really pull you in and make you keep turning pages (which is why finished the book in two days). But then, as you keep on reading, you find yourself thinking \\"really?,\\" \\"yeah right,\\" \\"no way!\\" The story just gets a bit incredulous, like an action movie that's supposed to be entertaining but doesn't really bear any relation to reality. Only from a book in which I'm more invested than a mindless 90-minute movie, I expect more. And this is before you even get to the ending, which is wholly unsatisfying. I do not need a \\"happy\\" ending per se, but it almost feels like the writer didn't put any thought into the ending. Like she didn't know how to end it. The book just sort of ends, and in a way doesn't even seem to fit the characters' personalities. It kind of makes me feel I wasted my time (and money).
0307887448|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a good friend and fellow gamer. Really fun read with lots of nods to classic sci-fi and fantasy works as well as lots of video game lore. Quick read and addicting book.
B005LQ6UE8|4.0|I wondered why more effort was not made to contact the members of the party after they had gone on their own way.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's super cute and fun but you need friends in the game in order to complete some of the quest D: other than that it's adorable.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|wonderful graphics. enjoyed the storyline along with the game. it had great mix of hidden objects and puzzles throughout the game._
B002WY65VU|5.0|Nothing brings a smile on your face more than trying to save Twinkies while fighting off zombies. A film that is bound for greatness like Airplane and Mad Max
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|They walk around quoting lines. We don't often let our children watch videos, but when they have a choice this is always the one that they select.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story line started off as a great idea, and all came together in the end, but there were times it was hard to follow, as it jumped around a lot. Disappointed. The other 2 books were much better.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|Like all of the other Lord of the Rings movies The Hobbit doesn't fail. It's a great must see for the whole family.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This version of the game flows quite smoothly.  The best thing I have noticed about it is that you can play when have the itch to play magic, but don't have someone to play against.  The worst thing I have noticed is that the lack of variability or randomness that is such a great component of the live version of the game is muted due to the AI in the game always having the same card order.  Still since one's own deck does actually shuffle, there exist at least some level of replay value.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I really like both Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper so having both of them in this movie was wonderful. They are both great actors and withe the rest I the cast it was a great movie

B006MW3V6U|4.0|I love Downton! It's so fun to be able to leave the real world and enter the lives of this great family.
193609648X|5.0|This is a beautiful book with detailed pictures! I love the patterns and I love Noro yarn. The patterns are clearly written and easy to understand. Some patterns also have stitch diagrams. The patterns use a variety of Noro yarns. I would like to have seen more garment patterns in worsted weight but I now have a reason to buy more yarn. One complaint that I have is that one pattern lists Silk Garden as a 3-weight yarn while several others list it as a 4-weight yarn, so I'm not sure if the error is the weight listed or if the yarn listed should have been Silk Garden Lite (a 3- weight yarn).
B005TBN04S|4.0|I love The Hangover. Part 2 wasn't as good in my opinion but its still worth it to watch it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The idea of a series of stories rather than one complete novel turned me off when I first considered World War Z but this was a great book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just as the title says it is fun. I love horses and I thought I'd get this and I love it!
B001LF3YQK|2.0|The red closure button doesn't stay put well and often slides open in the diaper bag, which dries out the wipes.  The case is also bulkier than I expected.

B004PVKFR8|4.0|I've heard some of their songs on the radio. So when I saw the MP3 album for less than 6 bucks I took a chance. I'm really diggin this album
B003K1EYM6|5.0|It works as expected. I just used the SD card reader into my ipad 2 (running current iOS as of July 2013) and it worked great to import the pics. I don't know how it works with the USB one. I didn't need to use it. Saved camera battery using the SD card one.<br /><br />I ordered the prime eligible one and it was an authentic apple product.
0307271080|3.0|It's not a page turner. And, there is no need to hold onto your seat for the revelations on African-American and white race relationships in the USA. The main characters are flawed, sometimes unappealing, but still held my interest. Overall. I liked the writer's style but, there were parts when the author seemed condescending, and she came across as pushing too hard with her words. Still, I passed along the book to a friend, and I would probably read another book by Ms. Adichie.
B00DHMXJUG|5.0|This song has taken some time to grow on me seeing as it is very simple. It is however one of my favorite songs from her. I have been a longtime fan and it is nice to see her do a family friendly song.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|We liked it fine, a good adaptation of a childhood story. Seemed to come alive with the CGI that is used these days. Would recommend to friends. Cheers
B001NA6096|4.0|It's lovely scenery and the beginnings of a lovely relationship.  I strongly recommend you see all three films and in order.  I saw the last one first and didn't understand a lot of it.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Any rating less than five stars is from those who don't get Tarantino at his very, very, very, very best!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game ia addictive.  Good way to pass some extra time and keep your mind alert!  I suggest it as agood buy!
B001DFIVNE|5.0|Excellent works of Robert Johnson with a wonderful melancholic voice of Peter Green and fantastic execution of Nigel Watson.  Some of these songs are interpreted by Eric Clapton and some others too, however this version with Peter Green takes you the era where songs werE written and you could feel real soul out of it. That's because of unbeatable magical feeling pf PG, Bravo +++++
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I think that this book was not  of the best fir great literature, but one that is a great story. I give this book 4 stars
B0095P33IW|4.0|Not too happy with the absence of closed captioning for the hearing impaired, but I liked the content of the of the movie.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|The first interface that was sent to me was defective, but upon returning it and getting a replacement, it was everything I was hoping for.<br /><br />The audio through here is far cleaner with far less latency than anything I was working with before.  The only reason this wasn't exactly what I needed is that I soon realized the two inputs just weren't enough.  I've had to get an interface with far more inputs, but I stuck with the Scarlett line (18i20, I think) since I liked this one so much.
B008220BLG|4.0|Surprisingly good story about a hot girl and a sympathetic zombie. Funny with a nice love story. Teresa Palmer shows she is ready to carry the right kind of movie

B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez was an up and coming artist when this album was released. No one knows why it didn't do well in the U.S. Thanks to our South African brothers and sisters, they remained vigilant and loyal to Rodriguez. this album is a classic. The music is folk, easy listening and full of inspirational images and messages. I just wish I would have known about him when he was in his prime.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love to play this game I would recommend it to other parents to let their kids play it as well
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have read all the Twilight books.  I was so prepared not to like Kirstin Stewart and Rob Pattinson for the roles of Bella and Edward, but by the time I got to Breaking Dawn 1, I was hooked.  Loved this movie.  Still glad I had read the books first...they filled in a lot of detail that wasn't covered in the movie.  This was my favorite movie of the entire saga
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show for those that love Si-Fi and can't find any new shows worth watching.  I am hooked, I am sure you will be too.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|A good movie, but I'm really glad I had read the books first to fill in a lot of details.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a really fun game except for sometimes it freezes it is like a temple run and subways suffers mix mist different themes and graphics
B009NY43NY|5.0|As always, a fun romp through the supernatural!  It closes the series well, but I hate that there will be no more Sookie Stackhouse books...they have been one of my favorites for a few years now.  Can't wait to see what author Charlaine Harris comes up with next@
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It was really a good book, but not as engaging as the first one. Also stopped in an awkward place. Instead of leaving me feeling like I couldn't wait for the next book, I felt more like he dropped the ball in a place that left me feeling let-down.
B0053O89KG|5.0|The dvd arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Castle continues to be well written and charming. All the actors work well and the storylines are inventive.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|It is a lot of fun.... And no damage when you wreck!! Gives you a variety of aircrafts... Who could get bored with that?!

B005JTAP4S|4.0|I was given a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I loved this book. When I first started reading it, I was unsure of what to expect from it but this book pleasantly surprised me!<br /><br />It started out with a great introduction of Peter and his curiosity. It centers around his 10th birthday.  He goes to a shop where he finds a small box that he wants to buy. Of course he gets it and this is where the story starts. When he returns to the shop late on, he gets swept away in a magical world.<br /><br />Each chapter is a different part of the mythical and magical world. Peter soon finds out that his box will help him along his adventure and hopefully return to the real world at the end of it. He meets a variety of characters to help him along the way, as well as a few evil characters. Each character and world were so well thought out that you can't help but get swept away in the adventure! It was well written.<br /><br />I did feel like the end came a little to quick. I wanted to read more when I was done and find out how Peter reacted later on because of some of the relationships he formed in the magical world. I just wanted to see a little more finality in the end. Overall I would definitely recommend this book to middle-school age and above!
0679411585|5.0|THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR ME TO REVIEW THIS ONE. OH, BY THE WAY THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK AND MOVIE. WHAT A GUY. COL. MOORE IS A COMMANDER'S COMMANDER. THIS IS BASED ON REAL VIETNAM EXPERIENCE OF THE 7TH CALAVARY.
B002APU580|1.0|Never received DVD for the above stated reason --I am trying to trace/track down the shipment to see if a friend of mine in Hollywood received it in error.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Wonderful book.  Wishing Mr. Larsson had written more books.  This series was exciting as the off-beat heroine draws us into her view of the world.  We take part in her challenges with authority and circumstances. Couldn't put it down!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This was a great game it is so exciting to play it I just love to play this is a great game and very appropriate
B002ZG97E2|5.0|We all laughed from start to end. Nothing more really needs to be said. Great fr kids and adults alike.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I opened mine and all the discs are there. I have not watched them yet as I do not own a Blu-ray player but the movies themselves are good so the Blu-ray should make the quality of enjoyment even better.
B001JFZ118|5.0|While there are odd things about the individual actors playing the parts (Scottish Connery playing a Spaniard, Austrian Lambert playing a Scot). That being said, I was sold the first time seeing it. And the second...<br /><br />If you are into Sci-Fi/period piece movies...this one is for you!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|love this little guy do dam cute can't wait till i can get more action on him scratching the screen is the funniest
B0063IH60K|1.0|Just deleted this game. Ads after EACH GAME! I understand the need for ads on free games but this was ridiculous. At least let me play a few times before trying to sell me a phone I already have.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a very addicting game so far give it a try . City building at it's best lots to do<br />Lots to keep up with.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a amazing game! The graphics are good and the game itself is fun. It's not boring, or repetitive.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It you liked Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Sun's, you will love this book. Beautifully written, the stories about a family span generations and continents.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've been a fan of Queens of the Stone age since their first record. My best friend had seen them open up for the Smashing Pumpkins in 1999 and bought their first record. We listened it to it from front to back and I was immediately hooked. I went out and bought the first self titled record and then bought Rated R when it was released that next year. I saw these guys in Tallahassee in front of maybe 30 people so seeing them finally get a number 1 record was great. And this record deserved to go to number 1, especially in a day and age of how horrible modern music is, this was a breath of fresh air. It had been 6 long years since their last record, Era Vulgaris, came out and honestly that was my least favorite Queens record. I still liked it but it just didn't hit me like their previous efforts had. In 2010 Josh Homme came out with the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures and that was basically like a Queens record and it was very, very good. So that record did help with the long delay between proper Queens releases and since I enjoyed it a lot, I had high hopes for Like Clockwork and it did not disappoint.  One warning though, this record is a lot different than anything they have ever put out before, but in a good way. Much like their self titled record was a lot different from everything else they have put out since, this also is very unique. Queens of the Stone Age have released six full length records and in my book five of them are masterpieces. Each different in their own right, which helps make a truly great band. Josh Homme has a made a record that will stand the test of time and is a rock masterpiece that deserves to be in everyone's record collection.
B0026NZR98|5.0|In 2000 I saw the movie like almost everyone else and was surprised to sit through more than two hours of it, despite warnings that it was going to be a very slow movie.  I was writing my doctoral thesis and felt for Helen Hunt's character Kelly who was in the process of finishing her Ph.D. studies.  So the ending broke my heart to know that she had pretty much ditched her academic plans down through the tragedy and confusion of it all (I got my degree, fortunately).  Years later, scenes of Tom Hank's character Chuck's frenetic career, the plane crash, and the 4-year existence as an isolated man who could speak to no one but himself, his fiance in his imagination, and his friend Wilson stuck with me.  But nothing like the heart-rending last part of the movie that was anticlimactic at best, especially when Kelly chases after Chuck outside the driveway in the rain.  Thirteen years later, I buy a secondhand DVD, and I am amazed how powerful those scenes are: the near-reunion at the FedEx terminal, the reunion of mixed and conflicting emotions at Kelly's house, now also inhabited by her new husband and young daughter, and Chuck's emotional conversation with his work colleague and friend.  These scenes are powerful evocations of the complexity of human thought and emotion: dealing with a reunion that is awkward, confusing, and undefinable.  The director and the actors Hanks and Hunt were brilliant in putting it together.  I have seen the last series of scenes about four times since I got the DVD yesterday, and man, they speak for the entire movie!  Tom Hanks might have had too high of a profile in the 80s to 2000s, but especially in the 90s, but he is such a very good actor.  So is Helen Hunt, as proven in her latest movie \\"The Sessions\\".  Overall, \\"Cast Away\\" is a keeper!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I have seen and read many Sherlock Holmes stories, including all of the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, so I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this new modernized version of Sherlock. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are a unique Sherlock and Watson. They both use their considerable acting skills to make the characters believable. The stories engage you from the very beginning and you can't wait to see how it turns out and how Watson will deal with Sherlock's outrageous behavior. Watson's response is surprising. This is a top quality series from BBC.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|Obviously this grip fits and works perfectly.  However, it is way overpriced... you can get an entire DSLR for the same price!  Had I waited, I may have been able to get a suitable knock-off for far less money.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was very informative and tells the story of what some people endure in their lifetimes.  Things that governments around the world should be trying to stop
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I was not expecting this movie to be so much fun. I'm looking forward to the second Red movie too. There is plenty of action, humor,and great acting. I love Helen Mirram as the hit woman! Bruce Willis is great as always and Morgan Freeman was very funny. Everyone gave a good performance and the story is fast paced and fun.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Picked this up for cheap as a Goldbox deal and I am very pleased.<br /><br />The new 4K transfers and digital restorations of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) are excellent - detail, color, contrast, all were superb and on par with quality transfers from much more recent films. It takes a lot of skill and knowledge to do something like this correctly and they succeeded. Prior to this latest transfer and digital restoration for Blu-ray, Aliens looked terrible on DVD when compared with Alien. Yet, now it almost looks as good as Alien. Audio tracks sound great, too.<br /><br />If you're interested in a 4K transfer and digital restoration gone wrong, see Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition. They got carried away with DNR and the Blu-ray presentation ended up terrible.<br /><br />Update: Have now watched Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection and neither looks as good as Alien or Aliens. These must have used the original transfers and were not redone for the Anthology. They aren't bad, they just don't look as good. To put it in perspective: I would rate Alien and Aliens as 5/5, whereas Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are 4/5.
0385349947|4.0|This book could also be titled, \\"a pragmatists guide to gender equality, in the workplace and in life.\\" I really enjoyed this as it touched so many issues, whether it's related to equality and sexism or just concerns about management.<br /><br />As the father and husband to a motivated and driven wife, I feel like the issues presented by Sandberg are all around us. She presents a compelling guide and case for why everyone should step up, especially women themselves, to help women achieve actual equality specifically in the workplace, as it will ultimately better the lives of everyone. I am inclined to agree with her, as study after study has shown that diversity improves the outcome of what teams create (affirmative action?). Something our work, country, and humanity should pay closer attention to.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|It is an unreadable, ridiculous waste of time and money. I couldn't get through the whole thing. I knew I made a mistake when, while in his coma, he had a conversation with his psychic friend.  Only a very small portion of the story relates his NDE experience.The rest is about his hospital stay, how exceptional he is, and what a great family he has. Good for him. Who cares? And of course, he can't explain what happens when the lights turn out, nuerosurgeon or not. I thought he my have some unique insight into the experience. Nope. When I wasn't laughing out loud at his narcissism, I was waiting, in vain, for him to say something of significance. Or at least something remotely interesting. Even his NDE is boring.
1451695195|3.0|When my mother-in-law saw me reading my previous book, Erasing Death, she thought I was actually reading this one as she heard about this one on NPR too. Needless to say that, and the fact that this is on the NY Times bestseller list, piqued my interest in this book. Regardless, a neurosurgeon's writings about his own near death experience sounds like a good read to me.<br /><br />Although the subjects are the same Proof of Heaven and Erasing Death are very different kinds of books, but because they cover the same subject, by people with similar backgrounds, I can't help but compare the two.<br /><br />Both books discuss fascinating stories, although PofH dives far deeper into the author's personal experience. While the experience is genuinely fascinating, ultimately this book reads like a melodrama memoir. That fact detracts from one of its stated intentions, which quite simply is the title of the book. Despite the author discussing the topic of needing to use scientific principles and methods, the overwhelming majority of this book is his biography, his NDE experience, and editorial about why this is &quot;proof of heaven.&quot;<br /><br />While Parnia's Erasing Death book was heavy on the discussion of actual medicine, that aspect of it is what makes it so much better than PofH. The author sets out to use the scientific method, and he demonstrates it continuously throughout the book, which is just not the case in PofH. The Proof of Heaven author so desperately wants you to believe, that he fails to make the case by putting together a solid scientific proof.<br /><br />Bottom line, if someone is going get the message out to convince others that this stuff is real, which I'm more than willing to consider, they need to be rigorous in presenting what happened and demonstrating why it's real. Convince me, please! Use the rules by which reality is judged, by which we know it to work, and make your case. That's the basis for everything we actually know about life, history, and our the whole of the universe. Erasing Death takes that approach and executes from beginning to end. While I think that's the ultimate goal of Proof of Heaven's author, he fails to make his case. I expect better proofs from a Harvard grad!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this game to be very frustrating but a lot of fun at the same time especially when you find the way out. Just don't give up because there is a way out!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Liked the book but I hate that it's dragging out the story just to fill two more books! I hope the last books in the series actually move the plot along instead of boring fill just to stretch the story out.
B0031RS69G|4.0|The only thing that i wished was different about this book is that i wished it didn't have to end. I know i have just broken the surface of the whole discworld series and cant wait to get my feet wet as it were. enjoyable, funny, memorable, clever. good book.

0399255370|5.0|The three year old I bought it for loves this book.  Her mother has read it to her so many times she reads right along with mommy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really part seek and find and puzzle solving. It really reminds me of the older DOS games where you had to keep typing messages about picking up items to see if they had any special feature to unlock. This, of course, if touch-based, making it much easier to find items. However, the challenges are rather interesting. Although many are simply trying to locate a sequence of numbers or colors, you are often faced with the challenge of finding objects and using them in conjunction with other objects in order to solve a puzzle that leads to a key to unlock the room.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this app  5 stars is that, even with an update, it only has 10 levels. A game, especially a puzzle-solving game, needs much more levels.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I know a lot of people criticize these books, but I really like them. I like the chemistry with the characters and the erociticism during scenes. I feel it is well written and a good story.

Its good to hear Damon Johnson's songwriting in there as he was a member of one of my favorite bands back in the day, Brother Cane. Ricky Warwick's vocals sound truly at home here as well as can be heard on the track \\"Kingdom of the Lost\\".

B0058W74UY|2.0|I was lead to believe I was ordering Adobe flash player. so I still can't view what i wanted to.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Every episode of this series leaves me saying, &#34;Oh my gosh!  That was SO good!&#34;  The Blu-ray is good quality. Having it at home allows me to indulge in my Sherlock obsession as often as I can get the kids out of the house for 90 minutes.  Sometimes I have to rewind to decipher exactly what's been said in the wonderful British accents, so the DVD is perfect.  I recommend this for anyone who is a mystery fan or anyone who likes really creative cinematography.  Fun to watch.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the game and find it challenging to beat my last score in order to get to the next level.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|It was nice to play a game in the water with the kids to make spa sitting more enjoyable for them. These cards were perfect for the beach!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This game is really fun but if you run out of lives you have to pay for more or annoy your friends on Facebook for more. Love the game but I find that aspect of it pretty shady and disappointing. I would rather pay a one time thing to purchase the game instead of being constantly harassed to buy things for it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! However, I did say how &#34;disturbing&#34; the story was several times throughout the book. It's not something I consider a light read but a good account of historical fiction.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|I guess I was expecting a bit more of his classic ballads  , many are there but not all . Good party tunes!
B006YTTVHO|3.0|What I liked most about this book was that it was straightforward on most common issues that we all face at one time or another.  It was encouraging to read that even when we mess up a conversation there is still hope for us.  I gave it three stars because I wanted to read more, I felt like it drew me in and then.....nothing.  However, I am going to read it again, so there is still hope for a better rating.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very fun and addicting. You have to really use your brain. A lot of strategy is involved.

B0039RY3MM|4.0|The paste worked well however the packaging was shotty and the syringe was like half empty when I got it. Almost made me think this was a used syringe but apparently a lot of people had similar issues.<br /><br />That said, performance is great. I used this on my i5 3570k between the CPU die and the integrated heat spreader (IHS). Previously I used PK-3 and temps were great but after a few days the temps rose super high. After two more applications and some digging online I found out that this was due to the pump out effect where the heating and cooling pumped the TIM out. Hence I tried Coollaboratory Ultra. Coollaboratory Ultra worked wonderfully. There is no pump out effect since it is liquid and remained liquid. Best of all is that I do not need to replace the Coollab Ultra. It's been over 1 year and I am still getting the same temps I started with.<br /><br />I did not use Coollab Ultra on the contact between the IHS and my heatsink because I was deathly afraid of drip and having rouge beads roll off and make contact with my motherboard. I used regular PK3 for that. While this stuff is a superb TIM, IT IS ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE!!! I played around with the idea of using it on my Radeon 7950 but when I took the heatsink off, I realized there were lots of exposed leads next to the CPU die that could potentially get sorted out.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|A very well paced and engaging read. The layers unfold beautifully. It's funny, sad, and eye-opening. I particularly loved Madame DeFarge.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|This game requires the player to pay money for additional lives and/or connect to Facebook to continue playing.  I don't mind paying initially for a game, but this is game will continuously asks for money  to keep playing.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is a truly moving story, or really a complex set of intertwined stories that ultimately converge on a believable not-quite-happy ending. The book tells a very thought-provoking tale that is not just about Afghanistan and Afghans but more about people, families, and especially about things that matter.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|The watch was received in good package and sealed well. The watch is a very good value specially as a gift. I recommend it.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is the best thing since the BBC Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth in it! I love the complex plotline and the juxtaposition of the servants' lives and the family's lives. Definitely worth watching several times!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging!!! I really enjoyed this game. It's really addicting and a brain teaser. When I started this game I could not put it down.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Looking for a good documentary and noticed good reviews, and I didn't really know anything about Bob Marley except his music. Very interesting and inspiring person in a strange sort of way. Despite the long length, I was disappointed when it ended. Excellent movie.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|What do you get when you take the gut busting humor of Terry Pratchett and the twisted humor of Neil Gaiman? The Funniest book of prophesy ever written. NOT for the easily offended.

B00CATONCA|3.0|What once was a great show turned into a living, breathing soap opera. I will list both pros and cons for season 3.<br /><br />The Pros about Season 3:<br />-The character development of Rick becomes more in-depth. The audience is able to see that Rick is vulnerable. After being chosen as the official leader of the group, Rick is burdened with the responsibility to protect not only his family, but those who are still alive. Once he loses Lori, his whole demeanor cracks. Ironically, Rick becomes the new Shane in season 3. As a person who once told everyone: \\"We don't kill the living,\\" he executes the exact opposite. Rick shows no fear to do what it takes to protect the group.<br /><br />-Enter the Governor. One of the most feared villains in the Walking Dead comic series. His long-awaited arrival is finally seen in season 3.<br /><br />-The romantic relationship between Maggie and Glenn shifts. Conflict rears its ugly head between these two.<br /><br />-Judith is born. If anyone reads the comic, then you know the fate of this character.<br /><br /> -Carl becomes bada**. The sheltered child is no longer hidden away. Carl's character becomes deep and dark. He has a belief that he should help people, but the shifting of his father's attitude takes a toll.<br /><br />-Michonne! I don't have to say anything about her character here. She is self-explanatory.<br /><br />-Zombies, zombies, zombies. We see more zombies in this season.<br /><br />-The infamous prison makes its debut.<br /><br />-The return of Merle and Morgan. Need I say more?<br /><br />-TYREESE!! A major character in the comic series.<br /><br />-Several characters we got attached to die.<br /><br />The Cons of Season 3:<br />-My major pet peeve with season 3 was the lack of story line. It was always \\"touch and go.\\" You got to know the characters for a short period of time, but there was never any major conflict. Incidents happened too fast and were often unbelievable. Sure, it left your jaw dropped...but for the wrong reasons. Everyone talked too much. Two whole episodes were spent on talking about the upcoming \\"war\\" with the Governor...don't get me started on that.<br /><br />-Andrea was once a character we grew to love. She begins to lack character and does the exact opposite of what we think she would do. Her mouth often gets her into trouble, and it is the ultimate reason why there is tension between the Governor and Rick's group.<br /><br />-The Governor. Where is the brutal Governor that everyone hated in the comics? All I saw was a wimpy man who talks too much. The Governor does nothing more than force his cronies to do his dirty work for him.<br /><br />-Yap, yap, yap. Too much talking and not enough conflict.<br /><br />-\\"War\\" with the Governor...which never happened after spending 2 whole episodes TALKING about it!<br /><br />-The mid-season finale was better than the season finale. Yes, I just said that.<br /><br />Overall season 3 was ok. There are both pros and cons for the season. Personally? I enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 way more than season 3. Brian de Pulma, PLEASE don't let me down this next season!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing... I began reading it in one day and couldnt put it down. It has a mix of mystery & intense romance. I love how much description goes into the romance. Everyone should read it.
B006QV30JU|4.0|like the story, and the music.  its a fantasy and nobody gets blown up and the world comes to end.<br />would recommend to anyone who enjoys musicals.  Not a big fan of all the dancing, but its Gene Kelly.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|Very beautiful and artistic movie. Great coloring and set design. The dude from burn notice is in it. I'm probably going to get this again, but in 4k in a couple years. I could watch this for years and still love it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is game is good but you lose money way to fast! However you will probably never run out of energy so that's cool
B008JFUR10|5.0|If Ray Harryhausen were still with us, I bet he'd be all kinds of giddy over PACIFIC RIM. And, yeah, maybe in some make-believe world, you can hear EVANGELION saying, \\"Hey, what the--!?\\" That's fine. Even more so than TRANSFORMERS or REAL STEEL or even IRON MAN, PACIFIC RIM is the ultimate expression of the rock 'em, sock 'em robot. And then you throw in the kaiju? Oh, my, it's over. As a fan of giant mechas and them rubber leviathans from the old Toho Studio days, I had to toss objectivity out the window. I defenestrated it.<br /><br />Somewhen in the near future, collosal monstrous creatures erupt from the ocean depths to ravage humanity and lay waste to our cities. But look at the bright side. These catastrophic attacks result in the world's peoples at last achieving global solidarity. Resources are pooled, brains wracked, and one conclusion reached: size matters.<br /><br />Required terminology: \\"Jaeger\\" is German for \\"hunter\\"; \\"Kaiju\\" is Japanese for \\"strange beast\\" or \\"monster.\\" PACIFIC RIM opens with a quick history lesson concerning the kaiju's arrival and man's development of the Jaeger project. After some experimentation, it's learned that the workings of a Jaeger construct are so elaborate that two pilots, locked in a neural interface, are required to operate it. We note the rise in popularity of the Jaegers and their pilots, their ascent to superstar status. But then comes their fall from grace.<br /><br />The story picks up five years later as the kaiju's encroachments have grown even bolder and with the Jaeger project long abandoned. What does it say about the film's star power when the biggest name involved is its director's? Still, the fabulous Idris Elba lends dramatic weight as \\"Stacker Pentecost,\\" him what runs the tatters of the Jaeger program. You could say he's the, um, Jaegermeister. As you've seen in the trailer, Elba can deliver one of them rousing Henry V Let's Go to War speeches. He sure wants to cancel the apocalypse.<br /><br />Maybe I'm biased. Maybe I'm predisposed to think well of this film and its performers. I liked the two leads, Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kukuchi. Hunnam is the maverick ex-Jaeger pilot \\"Raleigh\\" called back to duty, things having gotten so bad his antique Mark III Jaeger is getting dusted off. Kukuchi plays \\"Mako Mori,\\" the very polite restorer of outdated Jaeger constructs who herself longs to be a Jaeger pilot. Kukuchi is a breath of fresh air. She musters up gratifying doses of spunk when required. More importantly, she counteracts the truckload of testosterone. Hunnam has the less interesting role as the cowboy-type hero, but he and Kukuchi are very watchable when they share screen time.<br /><br />Guillermo Del Toro shows his devotion to Japanese monster movies. He delivers big time in terms of fan service. I'd be gobsmacked if Japan's box office doesn't explode when PACIFIC RIM debuts there. The scale of the Kaiju and the Jaegers is staggering. The CG is tremendous. In the end I didn't even mind that the only show time left was in 3D. The Jaegers aren't as smooth in their movements as the Transformer robots. There's a lumbering heft to these mechas that settles them in place convincingly. I did have issue with how, occasionally, it's hard to make out what was going on when the Jaegers and the Kaiju were in combat. Maybe too many murky clashes taking place during the night in a downpour. Mostly, though, it IS AWESOME!<br /><br />And just when the film threatens to get too oppressive or ponderous, Del Toro injects a witty grace note or two. I don't mean those two comic relief scientists played by Burn Gorman and Charlie Day (who seems to channel Bobcat Goldtwaith at his manic best). I loved that fleeting moment with the Newton's cradle in the midst of a city's annihilation. I appreciated the occasional striking character touches, Rinko Kukuchi and Del Toro favorite, Ron Perlman, championing many of these moments. Perlman has a nice extended cameo as an imposing black marketeer who holds court in the neon-lit Bone Slums of Hong Kong.<br /><br />Some dead spots? A few. Rote dialogue? You betcha. But, mostly, a momentum is maintained, the characters are likable. Again, Idris Elba is very good. Maybe it makes sense that no big name star shows up. The film's gargantuanism should be the prevailing focus, and it takes someone like Del Toro, who'd already impressed both fan boys and the arthouse circuit, to inject a beating heart and a humanistic touch into what could've been a cold, soulless picture. Epochs ago, the dinosaurs were a trial run. In the near future, the clock on the Kaiju War ticks closer to spelling the end of the human race. So hit the theaters, sit back, and observe as a has-been and a rookie try to save the day, afloat in the Drift, caught in a neural handshake.teer who holds court in the neon-lit Bone Slums of Hong Kong.<br /><br />Some dead spots?

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is solo much fun. It can be frustrating but it's so challenging you can stop playing. Give it a try. You will not regret it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun and a decent challenge. Not overly hard like some other escape games. It actually has some thought behind the puzzles l where other games are just tap until something happens. Can't wait for updates
B0063GORYU|5.0|Super twist on solitary.  Easy to play, yet challenging.  Card movement is fascinating.  Great diversion when your waiting at the airport or doctors office.  Recommend highly.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|After watching half of this movie, I needed a break. It's really just the classic chick flick dipped in a mental-illness themed coating. Very predictable and somehow the romance didn't ring true to me. If the movie had focused more on the main character's state of mind, it might have been more interesting, but instead his mental problems were just a superficial way to add the appearance of depth to yet another identical romantic comedy.<br /><br />Maybe I would like it more if I had read the book?

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love the app!  Upgraded to get rid of the advertisements.  Use it all the time for travel instead of trying to figure out each motel's alarm clock system.  Resently lost power from a storm....the app kept us up on the time until power was returned.  Sometimes use it as a bedside clock because the numbers are so easy to read.  Even when it shuts down, it's no big deal to just pust the power button on the Kindle and the clock comes right back on.

B005LAIIN0|3.0|I'm reading the book right now and it is far better.  In fact, I would say the movie has very little in common with the book other than the title and there are Zombies in it.  There are several things that bothered me about this movie.  I'll try no to spoil anything for those who have not seen it.  First of all, there are the Zombies themselves.  They move fast, which makes them more interesting.  I did like that part about them.  This way, you don't have to dumb down the characters too much to give the Z's a chance.  However, there is no evidence in this movie that anyone is ever eaten by one.  None.  That really makes them less scary.  They bite you and move on.  The main thing that makes a Zombie terrifying is the fear that you could be eaten alive and torn apart by one.  Take that away and what are they?  Not much.  A pack of Pit Bulls or a bunch of Fire Ants become more scary.  That's part of the problem with a PG-13 Zombie flick.  I don't like gore at all, but they could have found an imaginative way to give the impression that people were being devoured.  I know \\"imagination\\" is a bit hard to come by from Hollywood these days. The other thing about the movie that's puzzling is Brad Pitt's character.  There is nothing special about him.  There is nothing there that screams out that he's THE guy to solve this problem.  Anyone can do what he does in the film.  The only impressive thing he does is provide first aid to a severely wounded soldier.  Big deal.<br /><br />On the positive side, you do get some very good actions scenes and special effects.  Competent actors all around and some good thrills.  Story could have been better, but it's not horrible.  The characters in it are a bit better (smarter) than the usual morons you get in your garden variety Zombie movie.<br /><br />** SPOILER *** One thing that really ticked me off about this movie is the trailer for it.  If you have seen it then you have seen the best parts of the movie.  They should have held backsome of their best scenes.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|I absolutely love all of Alex Kendrick's productions, starting with Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof and Courageous. They are all accurate portrayals of how God's love can penetrate a person's life and make something incredible out of something ugly. The actors, though not professionals, are genuine. They make me laugh, cry, think, and feel. I commend Kendrick and this church's efforts to bring the gospel so effectively to a popular public forum.
B000FA675C|4.0|Really enjoyed it when I read it years ago. Way better than the movie. i also read Angels and Demons and look foreward to reading his new book.
B008JFUPFI|2.0|This is nothing but a poorly done,beat for beat rehash of Donner's Superman & Superman II. Wasn't the point of this supposed to be a reboot? Where is the originality? The desaturated cinematography/snake skin suit doesn't count. There were so many ways to do a reboot and they went with a rehash...
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Update #3: I received a response from the devs about my questions/suggestions telling me about the two issues I had mentioned below.  They've commented TWICE which I think is great customer service.  So if you like Mahjong Solitaire then you'll really like this one.<br /><br />=================================================<br />UPDATE #2: I received a response from the dev in regards to the timer and there's a way to play the game without the timer.  You just select \\"Score Mode\\" (duh - I'm blind as I didn't see that!) and that takes care of all my wishes!!  Now it's the perfect Mahjong game I've ever played!<br /><br />==================================================<br />UPDATE: I went and checked the Pause function and they HAVE fixed it so when you pause the game to go do whatever you need to, when you come back it's where you left off.  AND to make it even better, when you exit out of the program in the middle of the game, when you start it up again you are right where you left off so you don't have to restart a game.  So that's GREAT!  So now, if we can only get rid of the timer :)  Although, as I responded to a comment letting me know if I hadn't already found it out myself that the pause function was working, that the timer is small and down at the bottom of the game so it's not a distraction, just a minor annoyance (for me) knowing it's there.  Mind thing doncha know :)<br /><br />===================================================<br />Original Post<br /><br />I've been a fan of this game for a long time and I have to say this is one of the better ones that I've played. I love the wide variety of styles you can choose from and the beautiful backgrounds that are available but one thing I'm not too fond of, and this is simply a personal preference and not reflecting on the game at all, is the timer. I don't like the feeling of being pressured to \\"hurry up\\" that you get when playing against the clock. Maybe you can hide the timer and I just haven't seen it yet but, if not, I'd like to see that added. And I'll need to edit my review in a bit because I haven't paused the game yet to see if the timer stops or not based on the reviews that state it does NOT stop. If I find that they have changed that then I will update accordingly. If they haven't, I hope the devs will take this suggestion seriously and make it so (to quote Capt Piccard) and also give us the ability to turn off the timer for those of us who are \\"less competitive\\" and don't have the desire to beat a previous time.<br /><br />So based on what I just wrote and to make it simpler for the devs in case I'm a little confusing, here's what I, personally, would like changed:<br /><br />1) if the pause button has NOT been changed to pause the timer then that would be a definite change that NEEDS to be made. As a few  reviewers have already said, you can blank the screen during the pause or, as I have seen on other games, you can just turn the visible tiles to question (?) marks until you're ready to resume the game (if this hasn't been addressed already since it's the only thing I forgot to check while playing and<br /><br />2) have the ability to turn off the timer for those of us less competitive folks :)<br /><br />Thanks to the developer for making this the FAOTD and for taking our requests into consideration.t yet but, if not, I'd like to see that added.

B0017VG69U|5.0|My two favorite episodes, \\"Doomsday Machine\\" with William Windom and \\"Amok Time\\" show the benefits of the re-mastering process.  To me the special effects are of the utmost quality. This is evident in Doomsday Machine.  It actually looks like one with the new CGI effects.  We get to see more of Spock's home planet of Vulcan in the re-mastered \\"Amok Time\\" episode.  The documentaries are excellent and you won't be disappointed.  It's well worth the $30 or so for this volume.  If you grew up with the original series, you'll appreciate the upgrade in music and special effects.  It's like the episodes are brand new again.  They got a well deserved upgrade.

B008Y7G3JS|5.0|Amelie is an amazing Romantic Comedy that has a little bit of ourselves within it. The protaganist, helpless Amelie played by French Actress Audrey Tautou, has had a life filled with isolation. She is constantly ignored by her father and after leaving home, she is let into the real world. After discovering a toy box buried in her apartment from the 60s, she sets her mind on helping others. The irony is that despite her strong efforts to solve other people's problems, she has trouble solving her own. Her main problem is confronting the man she loves, unfortunately her awkward self makes it impossible to succeed with this task, so she communicates with him in creative and strange ways.<br /><br />The setting of course is France, and the film has a very pleasing green and red tint to it that adds to the magic and emotion.<br />The characters are great and expressing common French Persona.<br /><br />Although this movie is not appropriate for kids*, it will bring out the youth in all of us. You are sure to enjoy this film!<br /><br />*This film does have a few scenes that contain nudity and sex. All uncensored, so if you don't like seeing those kinds of things, don't watch this film.
B003UBTX72|4.0|I found this more interesting than I anticipated, and Keith Richards more appealing than I would have thought (although I sure wouldn't want to hang out with the guy - man!).  On the other hand, it _is_ long, and the writing style is so conversational that its choppy sentences get tiring.  It could have also used some initial overview to give the reader a better overall sense of the arc of his life (so far), in order to help us make sense of the journey.  So, not a masterpiece, but when done, I found it worthwhile.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were spectacular in this movie. I can see why she won an Oscar, her performance was amazing. A must see, feel good movie.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This film has six stories that all have a common theme.  The fact that we are all connected and our actions have consequences that affect human history.  What I thought was going to be a downer of a film turned out to be a rare cinematic triumph!  As one reviewer said, you want to watch this with the captions to keep up with the future-speak in some segments.  Tom Hanks and Halle Berry give unforgettable performances as different characters.  Hugo Weaving also plays the role of the antagonist in many of the segments. My advice to any fan of the cinema would be: Go see it!  It's unlike anything you've ever seen before!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Seriously happy that my kindle fire HD updated it recently. I have been playing this game for months and once I completed the goals, I downloaded it on my boyfriends Google nexus lol. I play this game religiously, like 200 times a day. Sometimes more. It is fun and I just love those gosh darn minions!!!

B000VDDDY6|5.0|If you see the documentaries on the re-mastering of this series: you'll see how the special effects have been completely revamped in CGI.  This time it's for the better. Gone are the very toy like models from the 1960's.  The images has been cleaned up and made clear by a computer restoration process.  The original music has been completely re-orchestrated.  You and hear and see the difference in this first set. I don't have the benefit of being able to afford Blue Ray.  However this DVD re-mastering is something you'll never forget or regret purchasing at this reasonable price of $30 or so.  If you love the original series, it's worth every penny!

B001FQIWSK|5.0|I came across this totally by accident -- I'd never heard a thing about it.  But I like Tarsem Singh's work, and I loved Lee Pace on &#34;Pushing Daisies,&#34; so gave it a shot.<br /><br />I was really glad I did. This is a beautiful and really unique film -- in a nutshell, a stunt man telling a fantastical tale to a little girl in a hospital -- but it's so much more. But you can discover the story for yourself -- I won't spoil it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, &#34;The Fall&#34; is a strange and lovely little story -- a fairytale, but with a dash of bittersweetness to it that makes the characters feel more real, and the action more fraught with tension. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and the performances are flawless.  The little girl as played by Catinca Untaru is fantastic -- one of the best child performances I've ever seen. The sets and especially the costumes (by the late, great Eiko Ishioka) are incredibly beautiful.<br /><br />And Lee Pace, well, after seeing this movie, why this guy isn't a bigger star is totally beyond me. He's an old-fashioned movie-star in this, and carries the whole film effortlessly, bringing charisma, poetry and darkness in equal measure to a grieving man who nevertheless takes a kind interest in a lonely little girl. (And side note: Thank goodness there's never a hint of creepiness to their friendship -- we really do feel a deep bond between the two that is very much parent-child.)<br /><br />As far as the film's rating and viewability -- I'd say it's okay for older kids, but it's definitely too intense for little ones -- there's some violence as well as some pretty wrenching emotional violence.<br /><br />If you like movies with a hint of fantasy or folklore, you'll love &#34;The Fall.&#34; I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loved &#34;Pan's Labyrinth,&#34; &#34;The Princess Bride,&#34; or any great fantasy films, from the LOTR series to Narnia.  It also has that slight edge and unpredictability to it, that might make &#34;The Fall&#34; worthwhile for those of you who like films that are a little off the beaten path, from David Lynch to Cronenberg.<br /><br />I found myself thinking about this movie a lot afterward. It's a really unusual, richly rewarding film.l&#34; worthwhile for those of you who like films that are a little off the beaten path, from David Lynch to Cronenberg.<br /><br />I found myself thinking about this movie a lot afterward.

B002ZG97E2|5.0|I went into this film with the idea \\"oh another annoying kid's movie\\" hey! Don't get me wrong I love children's movies, when I was growing up(space jam, sandlot, toy story, the goonies) but these days kids movies have gotten so over done and just boring. This is NOT at all what I expected! Warm hearted, yet with a twist of dark humor that parents will actually applaud. It helps that Steve Carrell is the main man. The minions are also my favorite part of the entire show! They remind me a lot of the aliens in the toy story movies, except better and with individual personalities! I would go so far to say that it is this generation's toy story. I see this series going far, with the sequel being released this summer. I dream to see an installation of the series entirely dedicated to the minions someday.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|The way the father felt about the boy was so typical and the mothers reactions to the issues seemed to be more correct.  It certainly was interesting to read it and put yourself in their shoes.  Difficult to see the problems in your own kids some times.
B00BHWG0EK|5.0|Of all the seasons, this one has the cliff-hanger, \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" with the Borg.  In that episode Picard is captured and transformed into Locutus!  The season also has significant costume and story changes.  The spandex costumes are gone in favor of something much more realistic.  We get to see more of Wesley Crusher and many of the others in season three.  For those of you who have their doubts, read all about it in the many review sites on-line.  If there is any season you should want in your collection, it's this one!

B002ZG99G8|5.0|I actually bought this movie because one of the actors wears a hat that was made by the same company mine was (yes, I am a very shallow individual).  But the movie surprised me and was really good.  Lots of action, and as much suspense as could be in a lower budget movie.  I recommend this movie to anybody that likes action, guns, and non-mainstream movies.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am still reading this book. What I have read so far I have enjoyed. I am looking forward to trying the experiments.

B00271HAK8|5.0|I watched it with my 10 year old Grandson.  He thoroughly enjoyed it!  May have given him some ideas he didn't already have! Lol.  To quote him, &#34;That was really slick, how he pulled that off.&#34;  I enjoy the movie too.  It's a fun upbeat light-hearted movie.
0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchman deserves noting but praise for every book she has written. Intelligent, obviously well educated, with a broad understanding of the follies the human race, she has never once failed to involve the reader in the era she is alluding to and, even if the reader is aware of the story, still cannot put the book down. Wish there were more like her!

B0087IT8FK|5.0|My choice of ranking this product is based on the fact that I was totally ethralled with the character studies and the manner in which the excellent story evolved. The actors were superb in their roles and the subtitles were easy to follow.  &#34;The Intouchables&#34; has my highest recommendation!
0385523394|1.0|This book is a hyped product and now a series on Netflix. I hope Ms. Piper is sharing her compensation with her new wonderful friends from behind the wall..I'm sure they would really appreciate the acknowledgement. I realize I'm not really giving a description of the content of the book, other reviewers here have done this accurately, even the reviewers that liked the book. But even reading through those good reviews I couldn't get that sickening \\" Private Benjamin \\" taste out of my mouth. Excuse me..the author was in prison but whether her mind was..Everyone really does have their own reality.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Awesome game..  I love all the different setups..  It runs smoothly too..  Can't think of one negative thing to say about this., and if I could, all the good things would outweigh it.  Been looking for a good mahjong game And this is it.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|Very diverse music on this album.  My first experience with this band.  Love the variety and was pleasantly surprised.  Enjoy the whole thing.
B000FVNX2Q|2.0|I finally had to give up my original 12C that I have had for approximatley 25 years.  It did not work perfectly for all 25 years (only about 20 years) but still better than a replacement I got some five years ago.  The replacement had keys sticking in a matter of months and I returned to using my original.  Thus I was hopeful, but not surprised when my latest replacement (the Platinum) did not meet my expectations.  The on-off button sometimes works first try and sometimes doesn't.  The overall build quality is clearly inferior.  I will be surprised if the on-off button is the only problem I have in the first year of ownership.  Hey HP, I would gladly pay twice what I paid for this piece of junk to get something of equal quality to my original.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great way to get the best reading material will always use it must try to know what I mean. Use and see.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|This was such a well written and interesting book about a subject that is usually &#34;hush hush.&#34; It is written in such a way that people with no mental health training up to a psychologist can understand the struggles and pain. I couldn't put it down. I read it all in one day.
B009JBZH54|5.0|- All three movies of the Dark Knight trilogy, plus extras such as behind the scenes material, interviews, etc all in blu ray format!<br />- Super clear HD, GREAT sound, and the best value because you are getting the whole package for ALMOST just the dark knight rises was costing last time I looked.<br />- Neatly put together in a quality box.<br />- Great gift for a movie fan, or for yourself!<br />- Amazon delivered quickly with no issues!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars has been my favorite book since I read it when it was published. If you don't like it there must be something wrong with you. DFTBA
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It is like Skyrim meets a good soap opera. The characters are rich and the story line is wonderful. It kept me entertained and I will buy other seasons. Pro: this is a great show in every way Con: not safe for watching in front of kids  or at work - lots of porn moments in it. What do you expect though it's HBO...
0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchman's \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a superb work of serious scholarship and precise prose.  She is easily one of our best historians, and easily the best in terms of range and prose.<br /><br />Concerning itself with 14th century Europe, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" primarily concerns itself with the Hundred Years War between France and England, and the tumultuous dynastic struggles both nations faced.  Started for no particular purpose, the French-English rivalry soon developed a life of its own so that soon enough war was its own cause.  Making matters much worse was the code of chivalry that the knights demanded that they live by, which essentially called for making war for war's sake, and ignored the national interest as well as the plight of the peasants (sadly enough, even if knights died long ago as a viable battlefield tactic the code of chivalry continues to the modern period, with tragic consequences -- see Tuchman's discussion of the French taste for elan in her superb \\"Guns of August\\").<br /><br />What makes the book such a fun and fascinating read is Tuchman's discussion of political intrigue, which is instantly recognizable to anyone who's read \\"Game of Thrones\\" or ever worked in an office setting.<br /><br />There are certain drawbacks to the book, which Tuchman herself must have recognized.  Deciding to write a book about a century seems somewhat arbitrary, and it's unclear what ultimately defined the 14th century, and so the book comes across looking like a sprawling mess (would it have been much better for Tuchman to simply write about the Hundred Years' War?).  To make the book seem less like an arbitrary mess Tuchman recruits a French nobleman to be her protagonist.  That's a good strategy, but unfortunately the French nobleman is dull, dull, and dull.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a very good read -- it's just that readers need to take their time and be patient with this book.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|when i got the app, it worked fine, but the next day it wouldnt open! I had to get rid of it because it kept on crashing  :-(
B0087ITBT8|4.0|Well written and performed.  I am not a fan of the female star, but she did a great job in this movie.  Had a great story line, most people should be able to relate to.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|This is a very fast quad-core processor with built in GPU.  I built a computer for mainly school, but I wanted to be able to play games, also.  I have this paired with 8 GB of RAM and it has been great!  I have no issues with normal computing (homework, web browsing, etc) or anything major in gaming.  I have been able to play any game that I have tried thus far with this APU.  Please note that you will not get amazing graphics out of this.  I would say the graphics for most games are about Xbox 360 quality.  The only game that I had to set to LOW on about everything was Battlefield 3.  After I adjusted the settings, it was very playable.  I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a fast computer with decent gaming ability.<br /><br />*Check the price on the A10 before purchasing this.  The day after I bought mine it went on sale for only $10 more than the A8.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|This Is A Good Game With Some Minor Flaws. A Zoom Would Be Nice And A Way To Save Your Game Instead Of Losing One In Progress.  Other Than That, It's A Good Game
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I was worried it was going to drag on just because of the plot, but it moved right along and I literally could not wait to read what she was going to remember next!  Great twist too.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have twin 4 month old girls, needless to say I am a little busy and exhausted!  Bought this trilogy as recommended by a friend and happy to report I am nearly finished with the trilogy in a week, not that its exceptionally easy to read-just a great story. I have the pleasure of using my kindle to look up definitions to a lot of words I don't normally use.  So I get to expand my vocabulary, it also helped spark a little romance for two exhausted parents of twins :)  Thoroughly enjoying...three chapters left!
B008Y5FNL4|2.0|You can save yourself some time and money by simply going to a mental institution for the criminally insane and watching people there.  The characters in this movie were demented, and the movie had a meaningless plot and no character development.  The movie got worse as it went on with ridiculously long scenes of people just standing there with strange looks on their faces not saying anything.  For anyone into vulgar profanity, decapitation, rotting human flesh, dismemberment, senseless violence, and extremely long and meaningless pauses between spoken sentences, this is the PERFECT movie!
B00BD6KPFU|3.0|Season 1 was great.  It appears that the main story line has been changed a bit and isn't as exciting as season 1.
1592402690|5.0|I was a bit afraid this book would be way over my head. many things are! lol. however, it is well written and extremely informative and simply a joy to read. if you wonder how a record is made, read this. before this book, I didn't have a clue. and it's full of stuff about abbey road and that whole era...
B0053TWVBO|5.0|Love this movie. Scary at it's best. Saw for first time as kid and still one of my favorites to this day.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I totally understand why this book has been on the best seller list for as long as it has.  I loved the surprises around each corner.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|Enjoyed musical version, but perfer: Les Miserables The Movie - with Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman, and Geoffrey Rush. It's okay.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Seriously one of the best escape/puzzle/hidden object games I've played. Not too short. Not too long. Challenging, but not so challenging to the point if frustration. Helpful hints in case you get stuck. Graphics are better than any I've seen. Overall great game!! Cannot wait for the next. So worth the money.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Adam Makos should take a bow. He's taken one small incident in WW2 Europe (small to us, the reader), one that had been hushed up by the US Army Air Force, and made not only a great book but a great history out of it. The main characters are both brave men, Franz Stigler, who goes from Lufthansa pilot to Luftwaffe Trainer, to fighter pilot, defending his country against the Allied Air Armada. But Stigler isn't a Nazi, in fact he is an excommunicated Catholic, who never loses his belief and in one wonderful moment of mercy (which would have gotten him killed), allows Charlie Brown, Farmboy turned pilot from West Virgina, to escape German skies in his battered B-17. For years the two men wondered if the other survived. I won't say more about the book, since that would spoil it for any readers, but I will say that that last few chapters put tears in my eyes. Mr. Makos brings both men to vivid life, letting us see that not every German was a Nazi, that some didn't allow the darkest time in German history to ruin them. I give this book the highest recommendation. Just a brilliant, brilliant book that deserves to be on the Kindle or bookshelf of every World War Two history buff. Bravo, Mr. Makos![[ASIN:B0095ZQ36G A Higher Call: An Incredible True Story of Combat and Chivalry in the War-Torn Skies of World War II]]

B00CWY76CC|5.0|love the game but did not like the fact that there was only 10 levels...hoping the get more levels up soon

B0010SKUYM|5.0|\\"The Name of the Wind\\" and its sequel \\"The Wise Man'f Fear\\" are the most compelling fantasy novels I've ever read.  They are big books but never slow; if anything I wish they were longer.  I savored every page.  Carefully plotted, clues laid down in the first pages await tying off in the conclusion.  The characters are complex and fully developed; some you love, others you loathe.  I bought copies for my daughter.  She loved them as well.  While waiting the concluding volume, I reread \\"days\\" one and two, enjoying them thoroughly again.  Treat yourself to something extraordinary; read the Kingkiller Chronicles.

B007P7UF06|2.0|Camelot is on my short list of all-time favorite musicals. I grew up listening to the OBC recording, and had most of it memorized by the time I was 12. I was so excited when I had an opportunity to see the movie in the early 70s. I was so HORRIBLY disappointed when I left the theater.<br /><br />Richard Burton is one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, and his performance on the OBC recording of Camelot is brilliant. Richard Harris' grotesque over-acting turns Arthur into a broad characiture, and his singing voice is barely able to do the songs justice. Julie Andrews in the OBC - what can I say, one of the finest voices the Broadway stage has seen. Vanessa Redgrave - really? She's too old for the part, and I'm not sure which is worse - her non-acting or abysmal attempts at singing. I can't come up with creative adjectives to describe Franco Nero's Lancelot so I'll keep it simple. Bad. The REALLY sad thing is that all three of the original actors would probably have been available to do the movie, but Logan, for some reason, decided to cast all non-singers in a musical. Clever man.<br /><br />As if the casting weren't bad enough, the butchering of the score/book is unforgivable. Before I Gaze at You Again, The Seven Deadly Virtues, Fie on Goodness, The Joust, and The Persuasion (the last two not on the OBC album) are all completely cut. Follow Me has been cut as a song for Nimue and been turned into background music for a (really bad) scene in \\"Act II\\" that was written for the film. Additionally, the original overture - perhaps one of the best written for the Broadway stage - has been replace with a soppy, over-orchestrated offering.<br /><br />I gave this movie a second star because it IS very pretty to watch; the sets and costumes are well done, and the jousting scenes are well staged. But these do not make up for bad singing, bad acting, bad screenplay, and bad directing.<br /><br />If you can find a copy of the live recording of the 1982 Broadway revivalfilmed at the Wintergarden Theater, I definately recommend it over this. You still have to deal with Harris' pretentious over-acting (and more make up than Rue Paul uses), and accept Fie on Goodness being cut (along with the whole Morgan Le Fey forest scene), but the other leads are all quite good, and on the whole, it is an infinately better representation of Camelot than the sorry motion picture.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good app. puzzles aren't too challenging, yet challenging enough to make you work at it. well worth the free download.
0385341008|5.0|This book is about as different as anything I have ever read, but very interesting.  I did not know anything about this area and did not know much about that time in history but was so glad to be told about thisi in an interesting and entertaining way.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  I now see what all the rave has been about.  Glad I bought the set.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Most books on Special Forces always talk about how perfect the organization is. This is the first book in which the author actually bashes the leadership, which I thought was taboo. That it itself sets this book apart from most books about special forces. Not that it makes me happy to know this, but it brings a reality that he shared the same problems as us who served in regular units. It's also a wonderful read.<br /><br />I first purchased this book when I heard of the author's premature death. I wanted to know what drove him. I now know more about him and thank God that there are warriors out there in the shit to protect our freedoms that so many of us take for granted, including myself.

B00CTKHXFO|3.0|I won't bore you with details about the games, but with a big omission from this Legacy. Japan gets all our items, but instead of the VR Missions, they get Metal Gear Solid Integral which any fan knows, it's the definite version of MGS1. Like Substance and Subsistence. I was very excited about the games coming out then I find out the MGS1 is not even a disc, but a code. I bought the Legacy from Amazon and I will resell it to buy Legacy from Japan which is really the version we should have gotten. By the way, where is the Document of Metal Gear Solid 2 disc. That should have been included too.
B003NB8KE6|2.0|Mostly comfortable overall. However for the price of these things I expect better quality. The bottom of the legs are different tension from each other. The elastic in the waistband tends to roll up inside since it is not anchored to the fabric.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter and I love this. At first she thought by looking at the icon that it would be boring. After one level she was hooked. It forces you to use critical thinking thinking skills while having fun. We play together on our separate fires to see who can unlock the level first.

0062280228|5.0|Sometimes in dreams, the places of my childhood have doors or hills that attach recurring, impossible additions to the settings of my early years. A door in the guest room that leads to a room that defies space, a raging river where hardly a stream trickled by. Upon waking, I am convinced that these places existed, and only through puzzling them out do I realize that they couldn't have. The Ocean at the End of the Lane exists in this space.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Of all of the Blue Ray concerts I own, this one is in a class by itself when it comes to the combination of sound and picture quality.  It was made for a high quality flat screen and surround system.  Even a non Eagles fan would be impressed with the picture and sound quality.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that this game is very fun, totally worth free! So if you are looking for a fun game that is free BUY THIS APP.

Set against the rich tapestry Martin wove in the earlier novel, A Clash of Kings is able to build upon the layers of complexity which Martin has already incorporated into his world.  Following the events of A Game of Thrones, the seven kingdoms are in an uproar as several pretenders to Robert Barathion's throne wage war to make their claim to the entire realm stand.<br /><br />Against this backdrop of civil war and strife, Martin includes several other storylines.  Each reader will find some of these plots to their interest while the novel drags when a less favored plot is being followed.  Nevertheless, Martin gives every indication that all of the plots are woven together and readers who stick with them and the series will eventually see everything come together.<br /><br />While embracing the tradition Medieval setting, Martin eschews the traditional romance of the period, instead attempting to portray the era in a realistic manner.  His vision of the war-torn seven kingdoms owes more to the Chronicles of Froissart and the History of the Franks of Gregory of Tour than it does to the legends of King Arthur.  Martin's characters are ruthless even when they are working with their allies.  Despite this, his characters have their own morality and personality which will endear (some of) them to readers, just as each reader will have his own favorite plotline.<br /><br />Despite the bulk of the novel (nearly 750 pages of story), Martin manages to keep the book's pace rapid so the reader doesn't realize how thick the book is.  The characters move in and out of the action and the scene shifts around the country frequently enough to keep the reader interested in the different stories while not so frequently that it feels as if their is lack of substance to any of the plotlines.<br /><br />Martin has managed to continue to tale of his earlier book by adding even more layers of complexity to an already multifaceted story.  His characters gain even more depth than they had in the previous book, and Martin has managed to demonstrate that things are not always as they seem and his characters are all multi-dimensional, having their good points and bad points.  There is every indication that when Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is complete, it will rank among the great classics in the field of modern fantasy.ore layers of complexity to an already multifaceted story.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I recommend it for anyone who like subway surfers also to tell the truth this game is more fun than subway surfers I also can't wait to see see despicable me ! :)
B00D5CENXA|5.0|I found this story entertaining and with a very nice twist to the ending. I enjoyed the descriptive writing. It made me feel like I was running through the woods with the main character. I don't want to act as spoiler so suffice it to say, the ending is not the usual kind of pap, but one I found very satisfying. I have read several other short stories by this author and enjoyed them as well. Looking forward to more.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It kept me engaged and wanting to read more. There were times that it was a bit over the top, but I guess that fits the storyline. I felt conflicted with the ending. To her credit, Ms Flynn didn't create the typical tidy ending to a story.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This novel really showed the vulnerability and humanity of Harry Bosch.  Its a great read to visualize his many quirks and his past obsession of his mother's death.  thoroughly enjoyed it.

159463176X|5.0|As with Hosseini's  other novels, he brings the reader characters you come to know and appreciate.  They weave through the novell, which is  beautifully crafted to keep one's interest and leaves you feeling a part of the country and the lives he introduces.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Wish there was more features, but this game is fun and easy to play. Kids love it especially, and helps keep them out of your hair!!!
B00000ICD9|2.0|I will put this back up for sale or find someone locally to buy it from me. Believe it starred Robin Williams. He just &#34;Tries to hard&#34; as far as I'm concerned. My collection is filled with 5 star movies. The story however was very good. So if Robim Wms. if one of your favorite actors &#34;YOU&#34; will enjoy the film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really like this game.  Was hard but not aggravating.  Interesting places to find things.  You really have to think.  Need more rooms please.
B0085FF55W|2.0|I fell in love with their song Hero on this album, so I figured I'd buy it. I don't knock the band at all, just not my taste I think. The other tracks were so-so in my opinion. Listened to it the whole way through the first day I got it and haven't touched it since. I do think they have talent and hope they will go in a different direction on their next album.
B007BZM3HK|1.0|i bought it because i wanted to see what the heck everyone would not shut up about. now i regret it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|thus is a creative game that is also chalinging at times it makes u look and guess what comes next

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|An amazing first season. Scary, funny, incredibly well produced. The actors are all perfectly cast. One of the best series currently airing.
0425263924|3.0|Huh... I looked up the definition of trilogy ...a group of three related novels, plays, films, etc. according to the Oxford dictionary, so someone please explain if the third book is not the end of the crossfire trilogy why call it a trilogy????<br /><br />That said this Novel goes no where in a hurry just the same saga over and over again mostly self created drama all solved by mind numbing sex seriously who on earth has that amount of sex for that length of time and that f...ing mind blowing every single time enough to give a nymphamaniac performance anxiety.<br />I got to the point where as soon as the dialogue between Eva and Gidion turned in to yet another sex scene I skipped these parts in desperation for more character development and a better story line but it never really takes off which left me less than impressed.<br /><br />These books have the bones for a good novel and the characters have the means to go/do anything but it just ends up going around and around and around in a circle (dizzy much) not sure if I will read the next novel or not will see what reviews it gets first.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Anyone who grew up in the last 30 years will appreciate some of the video game nostalgia here. The storyline is pretty interesting as well. Definitely kid-friendly and plenty of humorous moments. A great little family night movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's a really great game! I really enjoyed playing and eagerly look forward to the next one. Graphics were awesome! It was challenging but not so hard you couldn't figure it out after a little thought.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Humor in this movie draws both children and adults and has a good message in it for everyone. Loved it!
1416583432|5.0|Every time I pick up this book, I appreciate my furry family members more. Reading this has helped me understand some behaviors, and why or how they think. Well worth the time to read, especially if you have one, or are thinking of adding a dog to your family. This item was shipped quickly, and was in great shape.
B00BR476TG|4.0|the preveiw got me interested think i will watch the full movie now seems that i will like the movie
B005F9CPG8|4.0|It's the Beatles and their #1 hits.  I was surprised that some hadn't made the cut (Penny Lane but not Strawberry Fields?).  Not a big fan of their earliest hits, too cute and too much harmonica.  I jump to A Hard Day's Night and listen from there on.  Amazing growth in just 8 years.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I had not seen this movie in a long time but It is just as good as I remember it. Gary Sinese was great as Lt. Dan and Tom Hanks did his usual  good acting. My husband was a Vietnam vet and it was horrible  how the vets were treated when they came home. God Bless them and all of our troops who are serving our country.<br />I really enjoyed the DVD that let us into the filming and comments by the actors. It was really interesting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super fun and addicting. Flow free is most definitely for people with a mind for solving puzzles.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I think It is boring in like three fourths of the book but it eventualy gets pretty good in the middle
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've only played for 1 hour and I love it already! I didn't under stand at first but now I do!!!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Something Blue is a fun easy read and great sequel to something borrowed. I really enjoyed this story. I can't wait to read another Emily Griffin book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The title says it all but overall it is a fantastic read, Mr. Green displayed a wonderful insight to the remaining days of two teenagers.. At first I was hesitant but then my friend introduced me to it and I couldn't put the book down for a whole day! Once I finished it and I cried so much but it was worth it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I had an awesome time watching this movie with my family. My dad and I had a movie day together.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. It is so fun. I can't stop playing it. I think that it is the best app ever<br /><br />(credit for review goes to my 8 year old)
B000VE439Y|5.0|This film is simply a classic. I think it's only slightly behind Holy Grail in terms of genius but it still has a very important message that was very controversial in its day. I simply had to have it on my shelf!
B007SOQBCM|2.0|I enjoy watching twitch quite a bit and I was excited when I found this app.  Until I branched out from watching diablo 3 or league of legends.  The app only lets you select about twenty different games to watch..most of the time the games I'd like to watch aren't on the list.  Not being able to search for specific channels is also a big deal.  I want to be able to watch the channels I'm following even if they aren't the most popular streamers.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I had an awesome time watching this movie with my family. My dad and I had a movie day together.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Whether you're a fan of Sean Penn or not, Clint Eastwood directed a movie that's a must see. The performance that Penn gives is amazing. I had never heard of this movie but while flipping channels recently I caught the last 45 mins. of it on TBS or IFC, whatever channel it was anyways, I knew right then it was going to be a &#34;must add&#34; to my movie collection.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie starts off slow, but stick with it. It gets better. I was surprised that even my 8 year old sat through the entire film, and completely enthralled in it. This one is full of emotion, with some added suspense, beautuful imagery, and there's even a little mystery at the end. Worth the watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun! I really recommend this game because it's very fun for everyone!:) This game is kind of better than Subway Surfers and Temple Run
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|There is a lot of information that I never knew before about the band as well as individual members. It takes me back to my younger days and stirs up a whole bunch of memories.  This is a great buy and I recommend this DVD.  If you were to ask me I would recommend that it be viewed in order.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Alot happened in this book to the point the author could end the series or take it in another direction, only time will tell.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie and both loved it. There is a great balance of humor and violence and it doesn't go too overboard with either. There's some shocking moments and suspenseful twists and it never gets boring.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|You like fun? Yes. You like flying? Yes.You like super heroes? Great news for you! You will like this movie.
B00140PK6O|5.0|There isn't anything new that I could say that hasn't already been said for decades about how brilliantly the BBC does period drama.  This is another fine example.  Drama, comedy, intrigue, romance, all rolled into one.  Good show!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its very very fun and addicting. some of the boards are ease but most of them you have to think about it. I love things that challenge me and this app does it.
B000W799NU|5.0|I had an awesome time watching this movie with my family. My dad and I had a movie day together.
B0000YEEGM|3.0|`Rain Man' is an easy film to love.  It doesn't try that hard to do much other than to warm your heart and feed you a schmaltzy story about brothers at different ends of the spectrum coming together and learning to love.  From that angle, the film can be delightful.  When taking a step back and taking in the lack of true substance, the film becomes less agreeable.  The film offers very little depth and simply remains contented with giving us one of those formulaic stories that tries nothing new and thus becomes rather forgettable.  It is moving (that dance scene still makes me cry) but it is a surface affectation, something that reduces us to emotional tears because of the mere hint at a subject and not because we are invested in the film's soul.  This film doesn't really have much to say.  It sports some fine performances (both Cruise and Hoffman are effective, Cruise actually developing more character than Hoffman, who isn't asked to do much) but other than that the film rests in the middle, giving us mundane in a semi-glossy package.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I did not have high expectations for this movie since I had read negative reviews from film critics dismissing it as a poorly written screen adaptation of a mediocre novel. However, I found this movie both compelling and moving. I agree with previous reviewers that it is worth a watch simply for the beautiful score and cinematography. I am going to buy this movie after having only rented it, it is that good. I wouldn't expect it to win any awards, but it is definitely entertaining and worth watching. Saoirse is a talented young actress and I was pleasantly surprised at the acting caliber of the supporting cast. I thought the book was a good read (if a little slow in parts), but the movie is even better. I can see teens enjoying this movie for the romantic love-triangle aspects, but I am not a teenager and thoroughly enjoyed the movie for itself.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I didn't love it. I love Hugh Dancy and his character Graham.  I liked Hannibal the character he was a real creepster. What I didn't like was when a smart character makes dumb choices. Towards the end of the season it was a lot of dumb choices on the part of Will Graham and others on his task force. It was almost hard to watch how manipulated he was. You just want to scream at TV. It was good not great. I will stay tuned for second 2nd if there is one.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|There isn't anything new that I could say that hasn't already been said for decades about how brilliantly the BBC does period drama.  This is another fine example.  Drama, comedy, intrigue, romance, all rolled into one.  Good show!
B00C9U9YOW|3.0|I think everyone must be telling Josh that he's great and so we get this lazy, lack luster effort.  I do have to say &#34;My god is the sun&#34; is very good.  That song feels like it came from &#34;Songs for the Dead&#34;.  It feels like Qotsa is running out of ideas.  Maybe Josh should quit and join a band where he's not the primary song writing talent.
141659521X|4.0|I have no idea what order these books are in, I just pick them up and hope I haven't read it yet...if I have I read it again.<br />I love the counterterrorism plots and pray to God America has a real Mitch Rapp out there somewhere.<br />I'm not sure if Flynn finished his last project before his death but I can assure you I if so I'll read and recommend that one just like The Last Man.<br />RIP Vince, I've enjoyed every one of your books. You have no idea how much enjoyment youve brought to such a crazy world.<br />KCCO
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Walking into `Australia', I was expecting a disaster.  Despite being a fan of Luhrmann's, I was extremely skeptical of how this film was going to pan out since it was universally panned by nearly all critics and even by fans of the director.  It was seen as a misstep.  I was never really interested in the storyline or the feel of the film.  It just didn't have that same Luhrmann flare that I had grown to admire.<br /><br />I'm glad I finally saw this.<br /><br />`Australia' is far from a perfect film.  In fact, it is far from a great film, but it is good and one that, while messy, makes for a satisfying film experience.  The plot follows a woman named Sarah Ashley who travels to Australia to fetch her husband (whom she expects is chasing tail) and sell her land.  She is greeted by the Drover, a rugged and somewhat detached soul who is put off by the dainty Ashley.  When Sarah finally gets to her land she uncovers a dark plot involving a rival cattle baron who is stealing her cattle in an attempt to win over a huge account.  At the end of her rope, Sarah teams up with the Drover and a haphazard crew of drunks and Aboriginal's to drive her cattle through the outback and to victory.<br /><br />But the film doesn't end there.<br /><br />My main issue with `Australia' is that it's two halves don't quite gel as fluidly as they needed to.  It is clear that Baz Luhrmann was shooting for an ode to `Gone With the Wind'.  This is clear from some of the film's opening shots and the use of reds in the sky at dusk.  Baz also made mention of that in interviews at the time of the film's release.  The fact that the film takes place in 1939 (although `The Wizard of Oz' is the primary cinematic reference) is another giveaway.  Luhrmann was trying to make a socially important film regarding his homeland, and he manages to create some stirring visuals and connect some important dots, but this plays out like two separate films being squished together in a way that just doesn't work.  Sadly, the film comes off as a tad forced in some areas, as well as a tad repetitive.<br /><br />The look and feel of the film feels very much like a film Bogart and Hepburn could have made in the 40's, and that is nostalgic and endearing, but the corny dialog and plot points don't always work in a modern world.  I think that may have been a major reason why this is regarded so low by so many.  I don't think many moviegoers were expecting such a vintage feel to a film by Baz Luhrmann.  This is sad, because Luhrmann actually creates a beautiful homage to the classics and it is that aspect of the film that drew me closer and closer to it.<br /><br />When the film ended I was torn.  It was far better than I expected it to be, and yet again it was extremely flawed.  Flawed, yet exciting and entertaining and, at the end of the day, well worth your time.ly, the film comes off as a tad forced in some areas, as well as a tad repetitive.<br /><br />The look and feel of the film feels very much like a film Bogart and Hepburn could have made in the 40's, and that is nostalgic and endearing, but the corny dialog and plot points don't always work in a modern world.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hard to read, hard to navigate, and FULL of ads. The old version was great, but don't bother with this one. Same logo, but the new product stinks.  Even the background photos are inappropriate and you can't change them.

B00CU8OVIM|5.0|J. Cole dominates with his sophomore album.  Starts pretty dark and bass heavy with tracks like 'Villuminati' and 'Trouble'.  Ends with more upbeat tracks such 'Crooked Smile' and 'Let Nas Down'.  Overall, J. Cole does not disappoint with his versatility and production talent.  Easily a top album of the year and instant classic.<br />Cole World!
B003VS0CYC|4.0|I read a lot of reviews before i bought this set.  I had already owned 1 & 2 on bluray but desperately wanted 3 and i wasnt about to pay 50$.  So i checked reviews upon reviews to see if it was worth it.  I am very please.  If you own #1, the quality is exactly the same no improvements.  For all the movies the picture quality is great, the audio is great (DTS 5.1)  Now with #1 there is some noise to the picture at times, but honestly what can you expect from an older or 80s movie.  I know there has been fantastic jobs done to older films like Back to the Future, Batman, Indiana Jones, Star Trek are some big examples.  Maybe a better job could have been done with those &#34;noisey&#34; scenes but really it still looks good and is still fun to watch.  If you dont own them, get them, if you own on DVD im sure the upgrade will still be an improvement but i cant say with 100% as i never owned the dvds.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I was tempted to read this book for months but it kept catching my eye on the Kindle lists so I finally went for it, even though it was a little pricey. I should never have done it! This book is awful! I kept reading because the plot was good and I kept thinking that the ending had to be worth it... It was not. It just ends in a very ridiculous  way. I would love to get back my time and money. Please don't bother with this book.
0812982622|4.0|One of my daughters-in-law's debut novel, was one of the three finalists for a Pulitzer in the category of fiction. This book won. The author has laid out the strange mind of a mover through the mechanisms of the North Korean culture and government. This man and the milieu in which he lives is so different from us and ours that I can hardly describe. For starters, there almost is no culture--only virtual worship of the &#34;Dear Leader.&#34; The people of N. Korea live in a fog of oppression and suppression of individuality. They constantly monitor their words lest they say something that could result in their execution. Johnson thrusts us into their lives, and our reading results in our virtually becoming a part of their society. It is a unique book, but The Snow Child is better.  James Ivey

B009G78EE2|4.0|Coming from an independent label in music, it's great to see breakout artists making such a impact in the industry.  Fantastic find.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app helps me sleep so much! Turning on the waves or the sound of a waterfall knocks me out! I recommend this app to EVERYONE!
B003U53GK8|5.0|Just finished re-watching LOST again.  Having seen it once before, watching the last season was a deeply emotional experience.  Knowing what was coming in the final episode made every episode leading up to the finale amazing.  The first time around it was confusing... the second time it was a rush of emotions.  Just started on Season 1 again so I can experience the greatness of LOST again.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|Excellent buy. It was a gift and the recipient was delighted. Everything was fine. I'm glad to have ordered it.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Was sorry when I finished it. It kept me looking forward to the next page, chapter and follow up book.
0345529057|5.0|they are great books, just what it says, the first four books at a great price. easy choice to buy it.
B003719G40|4.0|I think this is a book every married person should read.  Even if your marriage is good it could get better!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Really enjoyed the book.  Being a big fan of TV show I love picturing them as I read the book.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|Brilliant in its premise, it makes you think about the condition of man and our relationship with children.  The last scenes as they leave the worn-torn city are gritty, emotional, terrifying, and some of the best images I have ever seen on film.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Entertaining but also gives insight into the time period. Warning: this series can be addictive and cause you to buy a tea service.
B00633W614|5.0|Was sorry when I fished reading the book. I couldn't wait to sit down and read the next page, chapter and follow up book.
B0009VSB06|4.0|have not had a chance  to use it. Have to take the time to read the instructions and my husband whom I bought it for has been too busy this summer. Looks like it will meet his expectations though.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The continuation of Gideon's and Eva's story  and thank heavens it's not over yet. I loved reading about them and can't wait until the next book comes out. It's Smokin Hot! I couldn't put it down and it left me wanting more.
0375869026|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It didn't end the way I thought it would, but perhaps better because Justin was accepted &#34;as is.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am a 30 yr old mother and I absolutely love this game both my kids and I play it and we have such a blast
1475972350|5.0|Max Larkin and Jesse Fairlaine aren't just another crime fighting duo - they're the best at what they do.<br /><br />In Time Killer, several members of a Rockton, IL family are found murdered and detectives Larkin and Fairlaine frantically search for the killer.  Larkin and Fairlane hunt a killer who murders people for wasting his time.  The detectives are in a race against time as the killer continues on his murderous rampage.<br /><br />Time Killer is a suspenseful thriller that keeps you guessing, page after page.  You won't put this book down until you're read every single word.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is fast paced. Love the auto fill. The backgrounds and card choices are nice. Always loved this game.
0743243153|5.0|I opened The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck, M.D. and my life will never be the same. I have to say this book changed my life forever and saved me spiritually in ways I never thought I could be changed. I wrote notes in the margins and have hung on to this book now for over 10 years. I have bought over 10 additional copies and given them to friends who have been in times of emotional need because I knew if they would open and read the first page, they too could be helped.<br /><br />It is not a book to be read like a novel. It is to be a book to be processed and thought about. If you allow yourself you will grow not only as a person but your spirituality and your inner being will become a unit that will grow together and heal as one.<br /><br />I recommend this book to every adult who wants to grow as a person and understand who they are inside themself.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Very thought provoking. Should be required reading for young adults<br />Is it ever too late to find your personal legend.
B009XEE0DW|5.0|With each album she seems to get better.  Once you listen to this, you just want to play it over and over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was stunned by this book not just by the great detailed story but also it's content.  This book vividly remains me that freedom it's never free.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|The is not mahjong. This is Shanghai. There is a major difference. Calling thus mahjong is like calling rummy solitaire. They are not the same game. Please stop misnaming Shanghai.
0670026638|5.0|Having read Ruth Ozeki's other books, I was not daunted by the very strange first chapter of this book, which is written in first person as the diary of a teenager named Nao who lives in Japan and who is writing her diary in a Tokyo coffee shop. First she fantasizes about who might be reading her diary at some point in time and what they might be doing while reading it. Then she jumps to another topic and begins to imagine a kinky sex scene. Finally she admits that her real intent is to write a serious work about her \\"anarchist-feminist-novelist turned Buddhist nun\\" grandmother and that anyone interested in perversion might as well put the book down.<br /><br />The next chapter is written in third person, and now we are hearing about Ruth (the author of this book) and her beach find in Vancouver, which is a Hello Kitty lunch box containing a watch, some letters and a diary. And this is none other than the diary we got a glimpse of in the first chapter. Ruth's husband assumes that this beach find is the beginning of a wave of flotsam that will arrive on the North American coast after being tossed out to sea during the Tohoku tsunami.<br /><br />The book continues with these two alternating stories, which sets up a rhythmic motion like waves on a shore, going back and forth between Ruth's life with her husband in Vancouver and Nao's story, which is now annotated by Ruth in order to translate Japanese references and phrases, as well as to insert her own thoughts.<br /><br />Nao's diary is written in a modified book, which was originally Marcel Proust's \\"La Recherche du Temps Perdu.\\" Ruth's part of the story is the author's own story about her writer's block, about recovering the past in order to write a book about dealing with her mother's Alzheimer's, which, of course, is a disease that causes one to forget the past slowly but surely. So we have a book about time: lost time recovered, time lost forever and shifting perspectives of time. In one chapter we are remindedthat Nao is pronounced like \\"now,\\" the point where the past is being brought forward in remembrance.<br /><br />Through the diary we learn that Nao's family has suffered a disruption. They had been living in California where Nao's father was a gifted computer programmer, and Nao was well liked at school. After Nao's father was laid off from his job, the family returned to Tokyo where Nao's father has become a recluse who thinks only of suicide, and Nao is bullied at school. During a summer vacation at her grandmother's Buddhist temple near the Sendai region of Japan, Nao learns about her uncle Haruki who was a pilot in World War II. He also kept a secret diary written in French, and these are the letters that Ruth also finds in the Hello Kitty lunchbox on the beach.<br /><br />As Ruth reads Nao's story she becomes concerned for her welfare and that of her family, and she tries to do some research online so that she might somehow save Nao and her father from their respective fates. However, Ruth is so totally in the present of Nao's story that she doesn't realize, until her husband points it out to her, that Nao by this time would be in her 20s, many years removed from the events recounted in the diary.<br /><br />Time is always the strong thread running through the narrative, and time plays tricks. Ruth and her husband get into a discussion about quantum physics and how there may be various Ruths and various Naos living simultaneous lives in parallel worlds. Unless the reader is fascinated by quantum theories, this could distract a bit from an otherwise intriguing story. There are even appendices at the back of the book that really get into it, along with other appendices on Zen Moments and Temple Names.<br /><br />What was strangely \\"quantum\\" for me about reading this book was that, as much as I love Ruth Ozeki's writing, I was dealing with my own time issue, and a long pause ensued between my starting the book and finishing it. For a time I \\"lost\\" the book and hadto find it again. When I finally got it back, I was putting it down and letting other books get in the way. So it was interesting when I read the part in the book where Ruth herself was reading Nao's diary at a snail's pace and getting distracted by other things. At one point she \\"lost\\" the final pages of the diary, but then they reappeared.<br /><br />This book is totally different from Ruth Ozeki's other books, and I think it is a work of genius.
0789324563|3.0|i was interested in the real workings of the movie, this is sort of an extension of marketing for the movie.  well done, but a product and now a behind the scenes look really
B008B68IEA|5.0|I chose this rating because the toy is very cleverly designed, imaginative and charming.  It has a TV and a number of accessories, including a little bed for Abbey's pet.  If you are the parent or grandparent of a preteen, you probably have already been asked to buy this.  I recommend that you do.  My granddaughter was so happy when she received this item for her birthday and she has played with it every day since then.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This movie was awesome! I think it has a great origin story. I bought the DVD and amazon--as a gift with my purchase--allowed me to watch it free online. Thank you Amazon! I really enjoyed it!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Easy to read.Great characters all the way though the book. Very descriptive.Left me wanting more. Fun and quick read. Loved it
B00969PR18|5.0|I got this app so I could download maps and always have one with or without wifi... I was quite disappointed to discover id have to pay for maps and that it didn't have all maps available... but its been so incredibly helpful in planning my trip since then it was so worth the dissapointment. looking for anything and it knows where to go. not always accurate on pinpointing the current location but hopefully you can locate yourself anyway...it also knows all restaurants, shops and attractions before you do.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Lots of fun and very helpful to learn how to play the game. Can't wait to buy the full version
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie was an absolute blast to watch! Fantastic story, drama, effects, and the perfect bad guy = a real masterpiece! I don't understand how anybody could even possibly complain about this movie. You get those true to the original buffs who already have there mind set on how they think the movie should be constructed and nit pick at every pin hole they can find. I think the actors playing kurk, spock and doc/bones are absolutely marvelous! A total fun and sometimes serious flick to watch. Can not wait for the Blu Ray!!!!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It is a nice book i will recomand these book for teachers i think it will guide very well !!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Seeing as though thousands of people like me have rated this book 5 stars before me there isn't much I can add. Mark Owen's book gives a great account of the life of a SEAL and the mission that took the life of Osama Bin Laden. As a former active duty Marine T.O.W. gunner I can understand the lingo and mentality of the author and his team. The author is free of ego, criticizes himself frequently, emphasizes the teamwork, boasts about the skills of his team members and tells what seems to be an accurate account of the events he took part in during the mission to kill Bin Laden. I really enjoyed this book and recommend this to history buffs and military book fans. This book is a fast and enjoyable read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really nice game! Not nice great... Awesome!! Okay, no more synonyms 0-0 But this game is for ALL ages. My little cousins play this all the time on their iPad. And it's easy to learn how to play the game. The quality of game is fantastic! Most apps that are supposed to be like Subway Surfers can't be compared to this NOT EVEN TEMPLE RUN!!! That's saying a lot. The only thing about this game that gets me is how addictive this game is. And maybe that time is froze up on me, but it is ALL worth it! Lol. And the best thing about this game is that IT'S FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And nothing get cheaper than free, my friend. v-v
B007704HO6|4.0|A must read for people who love cats and cat stories. It's written by a guy who adopted a homeless cat that changed his life - a real story and touching because it's real. If it was fiction it would be too badly written to care about, but since it's real I liked it.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|It should have more outfits and makeup .<br />Free download the world and to make the world and to make sure ok
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|Out of all of the lego games I have endured so far this one has<br />been the most fluent of the series, fixing many but not all of the<br />annoyances of the past. It's worth a play, my autistic nine year<br />old loved it.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book has lots of words i hope you will add some words anyway it is a nice book !!!
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading 50 Shade Of Grey I thought &#34;well it doesn't get better than that...&#34; WRONG! This book was amazing and had me hooked from chapter 1. Amazing story can't wait to get started on Reflected in you!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I choose 5 because it's really good books.  I think people who likes action,and laugher they might like it .
B001DDBCUU|5.0|If you're a fan of this originally HBO series that started years ago, then you must see this movie. It is recommended that you did watched the whole TV series to have better understanding of the story and the characters rather than just watch the movie itself. It is obviously based on the series. If you're a dvd collector who loves watching extras aside from the mere movie, then take this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|one of the best games I have ever played in my life.My<br /> little brother and sister are twins and love this game so much that they fight over it.
B00B8PMWJI|2.0|I thought with simple rules to which the directors were given, this would have<br />been an interesting different take on the horror genera. If that's the best they<br />can or could have done it's sad to say the least. Maybe if it's remade. For a quick<br />example there's a segment on two asian school girls and how farting brought them<br />love one another. There are stories that try too hard striving to push the shock value<br />envelope with tactless results made me think of The Human Centipede.
B008BZIUHG|4.0|After hearing only &#34;Keep Them Swinging&#34; on the local radio station I had to hear more.  After hunting down record outlets in my local region and findind out I couldn't buy it that way, that's when I ordered this wonderful CD online.  I'm abit of an old rocker, enjoying a wide range of rock/punk/metal etc..  Rival Sons has hit the nail on the head!  Brilliant!
B0069JBKHI|3.0|I really don't know what to say about this baby monitor. I was soooooo excited to have this baby monitor. We really wanted it to keep family and friends connected with the baby as we are far away<br /><br />Well the monitor arrived and we attempted to set it up. Our experience was:<br />Incomplete directions in box<br />Incomplete directions on site<br />No phone number given at all.  Anywhere<br />Only way to reach customer service is via email<br />Actually, email was sent before first attempt to set up with questions that were not covered in manual or online. It took 2 weeks for a reply.  And the late reply was incomplete.<br /><br />After 48 hours of utter frustration, trying everything possible I set up an appt with the Genius Bar at my local Apple store. The guys there were happy to help and eager to see this product working. 2 of them were there to help me and were not able to get this started. Grrrr<br />With the geniuses help, we wrote a note to withings customer service with specific product details and issues standing in the way of successful set up. The note was sent on July 1st. Today is July 12 and still no reply. This is completely unacceptable.<br /><br />I had no other choice than to return this to amazon. I wanted this product to work so I asked for a replacement. Amazon got a new one to be in 2 days. I was able to set the new one up on my own.<br /><br />So how is the product working?  Overall I like it. The camera is pretty good. The app works well on both of our iPhone and iPads. I love the fact that there is no separate unit to carry around. And it works just as well on wifi as it does on a g3 network out and about.<br /><br />I have MAJOR concerns about security. In order to share with others you must give them your email address and password. Then this person (grandma) has full controls to make account changes etc. there should be a way to let others watch/view only. Not make any changes.<br /><br />I will update this review once the baby comes and we can use it in real time. I am still not able to get all of the functions to work. It could be me but as of now no reply from the company.  Beyond frustrating.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was short, but more levels are coming soon. For a free app I say it's worth the download bc you definitely get challenged but it's not so hard that you can't figure the levels out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it so much! But I'm not giving spoilers :)<br />For any one who loves the hunger games will like this book.<br />(Oh yea you might feel some tears  coming on so I advise you to read alone)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is cute and funny. It is a great thing to play. It is a great time waster and it is fun. You will enjoy!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|i love this game. the only negative is that its annoying how a lot of the better things in the game have to be bought using in game money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and challenging too. I love Despicable Me I especially love the Minions!! This game is fun for all aged.
B002361MLA|4.0|I enjoy the straight, to the point presentation of Tolle's observations. Heavy subjects<br />with easy reading. Thumbs up, I'll look for more of his works.
0525478817|4.0|I'm a 15 year old guy and one of my girl friends insisted I read it so I did. It is about a girl with terminal cancer and who meets the guy of her dreams at her support group. I don't want to give to much away so I'll just stop right there . But I do recommend this book to girls and guys alike. Just read it and you'll understand .
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|I loved this book the mortal instruments : city of ashes  and the characters in it and I love Cassandra Clare.
B0046B1KHG|4.0|My son enjoys the movie a lot!  He wants to watch it daily.  This may be the next movie he wears.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|If you're in the mood for some new epic fantasy, where magic is approached in a whole new light (sort of taking elemental magic/alchemy and pushing it in a different direction)--this is the book for you! Sanderson's battle scenes are especially well-written and engaging, and his female characters at least think for themselves without all being completely naive. Loved it SO much and can't wait for the next in the series!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This is a great game. I like that it has controls from easy to hard, to fit each person level.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|The review says it all. Not a bad season and I definitely liked watching, but I didn't find myself compulsively watching one episode after another.<br /><br />On second thought, maybe that's not such a bad thing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Does what I want, easy to understand, easy to play. The only down side is the adds. Sometimes I press the wrong button and out gives me an add.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I ve been listening and reading Dylan for the past 45 years, since I was a very young boy in a small town. And though there's been so may great music since, he's still great. Larger than life like every genius. A rare one. I have all his records, and would advise everyone to do the same.<br />Thank you Mr. Tambourine Man
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Book is just average, a very quick read.  Ended without closure.  I was disappointed.  I will not purchase Sylvia Day again.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|I would recommend you have time to take on board the characters. If you don't in the beginning could be confusing.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|All of the songs have a wonderful bluesy feel - Wonderful for listening to whether you are relaxing under a tree or on a spinning bike.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's really fun , but I wish the people on it where less than they cost. It's fun for all ages to play
0425263924|1.0|this was such a waste of time. first, the release dates between the books were so far apart. as if that wasn't annoying, the atory still hasn't ended. who cares about megumi or whatever her name is. why does eva still go out with brett? I'm not reading anymore books in this series. I''m done. i wouldn't reccomend it to anybody.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Awesome track, the best on the album as far as I'm concerned!  Live vocals, bad ass beats...makes me wanna dance in my chair all night!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game will keep you up at night dreaming about the zombie apocalypse. And at 99&cent;, it's a must-have on the app store. Nuff said, I've got to go back to playing now, BYE!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Almost finished Season 3.  Can't wait for Season 4.  The acting is amazing.  Maggie Smith was born for this role!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's fun  I enjoy playing it anywhere I go and get bored  &deg; so if you don't have the app you should get it &deg;
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; series is one of my most favorite reads.  This entry is the most recent release and one of the most fantastic.  If you love the show, you should read the series and multiple times.  It's a realistic fantasy tale that takes you deeper into its world than any other series has ever dared.  It's an amazing work, but GRR will break your heart while he keeps you turning the pages.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app gives me approximations of th life of my tablet charge in several situations.  I find that very valuable.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I used to love this app until the upgrade now it has totally changed, I do not know what they were thinking. The opening screen went from here is your weather to lets see how much stuff we can cram onto the page.  I would even be willing to pay to have the old version back.
B006LSZECO|5.0|great!  I couldn't put it down.  Gillian Flynn is an excellent storyteller and her subject matter is original yet familiar.,
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|This was a fascinating story of a life lived on the fringes of society but gave insight into a young woman with extraordinary intellect.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This is a must have collection for the trekkie.  If you aren't a trekkie, but want to make a trekkies day bring this home!  They are all remastered well and look beautiful on the big screen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. It was great and kept me interested and engrossed! I could not put it down. Great!
B0081I08CI|5.0|The characters in this book are vividly portrayed, and I consider it one of those books you can't put down! George R.R. Martin leaves you wanting more, more, more.<br /><br />Being an avid reader, I appreciate the length of the books.  They keep me enchanted for more than a day!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Not ready a fan of farm Ville and the like but can't stop playing this. Doesn't take having a ton of Facebook posts just to get things from friends and level up. Just checking in Inc  or twice a day.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The exaggerated physics make it funny and fun.  You'll need coins to upgrade vehicle to the point where you can make real progress if you really care about that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my family loves this silly game. easy enough for everyone, challanging enough to keep even my 15yr old busy
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is not for people who don't like explicit sex.  I love this book and so have many other of my friends and my sisters.<br />I love the characters and story line (it's not all sex).  Can't wait to figure out what's going on with Mr. Steele in the 3rd book!!!!
1451627297|2.0|...and unread this.  I've always loved Stephen King but *yaaawn*.  Way too long.  The time travel premise is silly anyway ....if someone could go back over and over again and change things, then what is reality?
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I read this while vacationing this summer and this is a novel I could not put down!  A fun read!
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I'd heard &#34;Home&#34; as part of a TV commercial and had been looking for the the group singing it.  Finally I found Magnetic Zeros.  Several great songs and sounds
0307352145|5.0|As an extrovert who was responsible for leading a team of both extroverts and introverts and as a mother of both an extrovert and introvert, this book gave some wonderful advice in understanding the introverts among us and making sure we don't miss out on their contributions.  Still waters do run deep and when extroverts shut up enough to give their quieter colleagues a chance to talk, the insight gained is usually enlightening.  The book also does a good job letting introverts know what they can do to make themselves heard in a noisy shallow environment.  I have recommended this book to many people!
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|For all the Willie lovers me and my wife we love Willies song .<br />Go Willie go. Great music and lyric.<br />I recommend this.<br /><br />Ken,NC.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This is a great app to remotely access your computer from your easy chair and act like you are in your computer chair.
B003JH8LPW|2.0|Couldn't wait for it to end. Droned on and on.  But as usual, I learned a thing or two. On to Inferno
B001TCHDPS|5.0|You should hear what made the South Africans love this guy!  We saw the Searching for Sugar Man video and just had to get Rodriguez' three CDs.  My son in Australia works with some South Africans and they verified that he was, and still is, a hit.  Great discovery!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun to play and easy.  Sometimes during a particularly good run the game just shuts down.  Also sometimes locks up my kindle during the start up load and then I have to power down and restart the device.  These glitches haven't stopped me from playing though.
0425263924|1.0|Like many other readers, I believed this was going to be the last book in the Crossfire series.  Although neither of the two previous books were knock-it-out-of-the-park wonderful, they were entertaining and I was interested to read the conclusion of the series.  Imagine my disgust when I finished Entwined with You last night, only to learn that it ends mid-scene with ZERO conclusion to any of the plot points.  It was nothing but filler - a way for the author and/or publisher to make more money by riding the tails of the 50 Shades craze.  Additionally, Eva's unending lust for Brett is seriously out of character for her and weakens the bond with Gideon - she comes across as loving Gideon for his looks and his bedroom performance only, which is something I never thought with the first two books.<br /><br />Sylvia Day has betrayed her audience with this poor showing and I am no longer interested in what she has to offer.  She started the series as a romance with heart and passion, filled with human characters, relate-able issues, and steamy sex. In the third book, she lost her way, and as a result, a reader.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Travis is such a walking contradiction!! Love, fierceness, sense of humor, protective and crazy!! I loved reading about him and seeing him evolve before Abby's eyes. He is just an amazing 'vision' to me. Every woman wants to be loved so passionately, but he takes it up a notch and does it with a twinge of crazy!! I loved the journey they took and what they went through.....I smiled and giggled a few times. &#60;3 ❤ Great story!! I'm glad I finally read it. Going to download Walking Disaster now!!
B00459EZLW|5.0|If you like star trek and/or battle star gallactica you will like this series.  Dark at times, but the plot is riveting and inventive.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|You should hear what made the South Africans love this guy!  We saw the Searching for Sugar Man video and just had to get the three Rodriquez CDs.  Great discovery!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game really keeps the brain moving.  I love it although it requires your full attention-can't do 2 things at once with this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have gotten attached to the characters and cant wait for the next book in the series. The characters really draw you in
B009XIXVU6|5.0|love his ability to tell a story and make you feel that you are a part of it.  The descripyion of life In Afghanistan made me feel like I was there.

1781162646|3.0|This is not my favorite of all the Stephen King books.  I felt like he wrote the first couple of chapters and then someone else finished it.

B005LAJ23A|5.0|This is perhaps the best television series i have ever  watched.  The blu ray makes it ever better with master high definition picture quality and sound. The special features a great too,  audio commentaries on selected episodes, deleted scenes and behind the scenes. A must have for all fans of the show.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|I have always enjoyed watching this movie.  Even though I have seen it several times, I will still watch it again.  I can't say that for all movies.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked it even though it was REALLY easy.<br />But yeah still enjoyed it really fun. Haha<br />I do however highly suggest you TRY this I mean<br />It is free. Lol
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|We downloaded this game for our 5 year old son and the only disappointment is he has not reached a level showing the &#34;donut&#34; that he saw on advertisements.

B000H4TX9I|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this series.  Like too many other science fiction series, it only lasted one very short season.  It leaves things unfinished.  I understand there is a movie though I haven't seen it yet.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great and fun game for all ages I really liked it it was in my sister's tablet. Great Minion Rush
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Now I can finally remove this from my smart phone!  A fun past time for both of my kids, ages 5 and 8.
B008476HBM|5.0|A favourite read that delights more and more each time.  Such elegance and wit contained in beautifully constructed prose, this is a novel forever fresh and of enduring brilliance that should be read many times to be fully appreciated.
B007SGM084|4.0|Had a hard time getting into the books. They were referenced to me by a relative.  I don't think I would have purchased them to read, but was curious to find out what others were talking about.  I lost interest in the first book as there really wasn't much of a story. I think the last book was the best. It has taken me over 8 months to read these books.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Only the Coen brothers would be warped enough to come up with a tribute to the The Odyssey based in Depression Era Mississippi in their entertaining O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?  Only the Ulysses this time is an escaped con, who along with two cohorts, embark on a surreal journey searching for an alleged \\"loot\\" that will make them rich beyond their wildest dreams.  But they're already rich and famous--they just don't know it.  Joining a fourth man who has just sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar, they record \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" in a cracker box studio, calling themselves the Soggy Bottom Boys; the tune becomes a statewide sensation.  Yet Ulysses and his group are constantly on the run, primarily from prison guards intent on inflicting their own vigilante justice; en route the runaways encounter just about everything, from seductive sirens to a one-eyed con. . .even a choreographed Klan rally.  Yet as this delightful film comes to its climax, we learn the real reason Ulysses wants to escape from prison.<br /><br />George Clooney is sensational as Ulysses Everett McGill, a smooth-talking persuader with a weakness for Dapper Dan pomade (no doubt a tongue-in-cheek spoof to Clooney himself). But even better are John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as Pete and Delmar, the fellow cons who escape with Ulysses.  Both sport enough clueless facial expressions and thick hick twang to make Hee Haw look like Masterpiece Theater.  John Goodman, always remarkably good, has a brief role as a one-eyed Bible salesman--a salesman with other intentions up his sleeve.  And the rest of the cast more than holds its own.  But the real stars of O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? are the imaginative Coens, who through their images and music and settings serve us up a slice of Down South Americana. It's definitely humor with a dark edge; the flawlessly choreographed Klan rally (conjuring images of Nuremberg) is fabulously funny, yet its ugly point is unmistakably made.  Sometimes a bit too whimsical, O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is still a grand satirical tribute to one of the oldest tales of time.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.whimsical, O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is still a grand satirical tribute to one of the oldest tales of time.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I was introduced by a friend to the earliest novels of Discworld. I really enjoyed them.I like the humor of them,which doesn't get in the way of the story. I will definitely be exploring more of the more current novels
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Fun to read, compelling characters, great plot lines.  Easy to see why HBO did the series. Reading the books gives a different view into the characters.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|i liked the game.  fast download and no problem on my kindle.  interesting story, cool puzzles.  i was only creaped out by the characters when they spoke, other than that, i recommend this.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Description says it. I have an AMD 8350 with the stock heatsink that came in the package. It ran at 40 degrees Celsius idle kept hitting 65 degrees after about 20 minutes under load, notably running high-end games. The OEM heatsink was also extremely loud, I could hear it with a box-fan running in my room. I didn't want to put much wear on a new CPU so I bought a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus along with some of this Arctic Silver 5 thermal compound.<br /><br />I have some much older OCZ Freeze that always worked well and it got about time where the little bit I have left was a little stiffer than it should be, probably left the cap off too long over time. Anyway, this stuff is darker than the older compound and the newer stuff spreads easier over the CPU. Use a toothpick to make a very thin even layer. This stuff has a break-in of a few minutes, my CPU ran right at 40 degrees Celsius idle for about an hour then it went down to 28-31 degrees idle. Because this stuff says 'polysynthetic' on the tube I am going to assume it has a break-in period different to the stuff I used before, however it works very well along with the heatsink I bought. I'm going to start testing the system under load soon and I might update.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Works well, like the real Minecraft.  Minus one star because land is limited making the world you create rather small.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Season 4 doesn't let you down. If you are a Merlin fan you'll like it, It moves the legend along nicely.
B002SKZBQS|4.0|I have only read one other of the Bachman novels, The long walk and I remember really enjoying it so when I came across Roadwork I was excited to read it. The Bachman novels are not really so much horror as Kings novels are and the difference is nice. I find it sad King had to stop writing as Bachman personally.<br />Roadwork is about a man who loses his place of employment and his house because the city is building a highway through both. He doesn't want to lose either and doesn't take it well at all.<br />The story was a little predictable most of the time the story flowed along nicely and despite it being predictable I found myself still wanting to keep turning the pages to see what happened. I really felt for George and was rooting for him the entire way!<br />If you are a fan of King/Bachman then I would highly recommend this book.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|I HAVEN'T READ MUCH OF THIS BOOK. I HAVE IT TO READ UNTIL AUGUST 1 AS A PRIME MEMBER. I LIKED HIS PRESENTATIONS ON THE TV FOOD CHANNEL BECAUSE HE ADAPTED WELL TO MANY CULTURES ,IN ANY SITUATION! YOU. ARE WHAT YOU EAT; AND FOR MANY PEOPLE EATING IS ONE OF THE LONGEST LASTING ENJOYMENTS. IN LIFE: COOL LIGHT, FRESH AIR. SWEET WATER AND WINE. SAVORY FOOD, AND GOOD COMPANY. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE I WAS ANTICIPATIN HIS DESCRIPTION OF A MEAL HE SHARED WITH CATTLEMEN IN ARGENTINA AFTER THEY HAD JUST CASTRATED 20 YEARLING BULLS IN A SHED OUT ON THE RANGE.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Awesome DVD
B002PEP4SC|5.0|My niece recommended these books.  Loved HEAT WAVE. It mixes a perfect balance of mystery, &#34;heat&#34;, intrigue, and humor.  This is my first one.  I'll definitely be reading more of Castle's books.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|My kids watched it for the second time and really enjoyed the Marvel comics movie.  They love Iron Man and all the rest of the characters in the movie.  Always a good movie you can watch over and over again!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is very fun! I definitely enjoy playing Minion Rush. It's a super cute twist on Temple Run that's perfect for all ages! My only complaint is that one day it wouldn't let me in and kept booting me off. I had to then delete the game and download it all over again. It works fine now.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Truly a thought-provoking take on a seemingly simple horror premise-how would humanity survive the zombie apocalypse?  Could we, with our humanity intact?  Very well written, I would suggest this book to anyone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender is the ultimate hero - doing what must be done, no matter the cost to himself. The fact that he's only 6 years old at the beginning of the book is secondary to his soft heart and brilliant mind. I love it!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The books in this series have been great and have kept me coming back for more. James Dashner is a brilliant author.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A great and entertaining game. Had a good time with it. Wish there were more levels. Looking forward to updates.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|Well written account of how we evolved from basically a worm to the here and now; from crawling to landing on the moon.  Find out where hiccups came from.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Shai is a forger tasked with the impossible - to forge the emperor's soul. But can she do it before time runs out and her own life is forfeit?<br /><br />This is a beautifully written story with a different feel than Sanderson's other works. The magic is, of course, unique and enticing and the characters deep. But I found a slower, softer, more lovely feel to Shai's story than I expected. I was entranced from the first page.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I was impressed.  It looks like a lot of care, effort, and money was put into the production.  We'll see if this continues.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a wonderful trilogy and a perfect ending. Beautifully written with all the action, love, and psychological drama one could hope for.
1451695195|5.0|The poem in this story brings tears to all who have lost a loved one. And the story itself is remarkable and thought provoking.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is an excellent movie of a Broadway musical with an excellent cast.  I can't wait to watch all the extras on the DVD's.  I have a very emotional relationship with this movie.  My college friends and I could sing every song within days of buying the soundtrack and we've been singing them for 47 years together.  I think a lot of folks love this family film and have shared it with their own children and grandchildren since it was released.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|this app is very addictive. I only have one problem with this game. Every once in a while, it will go slow and then all of a sudden speed up. If this happends to you, don't unninstall the app. I will work itself out within 4 days tops.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another fantastic book by Khaled Hosseini.  One of my favorite authors.  Passing the book to my daughter to enjoy!  Great read.
0399159029|4.0|I like that Gunther has left Berlin, into WW2,  and is now trying to stay one step ahead of the Nazi machine while being part of it (what choice did he have?).
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|great game , easy to see tiles , colorful tiles. No pressure , relaxing to play. graphics very good like options to find tile very helpful
159463176X|4.0|Mountains Echoed was engaging but I thought his previous novels were better particularly his debut Kite Runner was the best of the 3.  Mountains was certainly worth the read.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Title sounds corny but content was great. The author has a brilliant knack of writing what most people would be thinking if in the same situations as her characters.
B000002J03|5.0|Love this CD and play every day commuting to work.  Love the combination of tender song \\"Thank You\\" and my favorite \\"Ramble On\\"!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|WHEN I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT A WORD MEANS OR IF I SPELLED IT CORRECT I ALWAYS USE GOOGLE. WHEN I HAVE A NEW MED I ALWAYS USE GOOGLE TO GET MORE INFORMATION
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I've only really used &quot;writer&quot; so far.  My intention was to take notes in meetings.  I use a lot of bullets in my notes and there is no function for adding them.  If you create the bullet in Microsoft Word and then open the same document in this program it will sort of work, but that's too much effort.  I wish this had bullets.  Other than that, it's a pretty useful tool.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has worked great for my Fire HD which I got in 12/12.  The information provided has been accurate and helpful, I'd definitely recommend this free Amazon app!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Just...wow. I am officially hooked on this very creative show. In the event of a zombie pandemic, I would imagine it would be exactly like this show. Very awesome story throughout. Can't wait for new episodes!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE MY CHRGER FOR MY KINDLE AS I LOVE READING, WATCHING MY FAVORITE SINGER. JUST THE BEST THING EVER
1400069289|5.0|At first after reading this book I was only going to give it three stars because I felt it left me directionless. Sure I much better understood habits and their importance in our lives but had no direct way to attack the problem of changing my habits. Thankfully i found the section titled \\"A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas.\\" This, to me, was by far the most important section of the book. The rest of the book was entertaining and gave nice depth to a few specific examples of changing habits, but this section really laid out the groundwork for how to change your habits, and thus your life.<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone (specifically part one and the Appendix)<br /><br />You will not be dissapointed
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love love love this game. it is an absolutely fun and addictive game. so much fun. cant put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|would it work it loads and then it goes back to the main menu and then I keep doing it it still does it work.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|AS ALWAYS I LOVE ACTION MOVIES. I HAVE ALL THE OTHER DIE HARD MOVIES SO WHY WOULDN'T I BUY THIS ON
B0034DGPEU|4.0|At first this book was hard to get in to, but after the first 20 chapters it started to grow on me.  By the end I liked it a lot and would read a sequel should the author write one.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I usually don't play games but this one hook me up. Very addicting and fun! I can't get any work done now because I'm playing all the time! :)
B0064X7FVE|2.0|the previous version was simple and easy to use and understand.  the new version is cluttered. &amp; overly complicated.  the new version thinks its a video game with tons of features that just get in the way. who the heck needs to &quot;unlock achievements&quot; and earn points. it's a weather app for cripes sake. I just want a simple way to check the weather. if I want a flipping game app I'll buy a game app. just give me a way to get the ole version back.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|HE IS A GREAT ACTION ACTOR HAVE ALL HIS ACTION MOVIES AND A FEW COMDEY ONE. THIS ONE WAS DIFFERNET BUT I STILL LIKE IT
B00013UTUM|5.0|Disc one has a ton of crazy stuff. Disc two showcases how incredible Muse is live. Great set of two CDs. Love it.
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|Rashomon is probably the greatest Kurosawa film. The restoration done for the blu ray transfer is incredible.  I previously owned the Criterion DVD.  I was blown away with the blu ray.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great way to relax in your life while watching the drama of the Downton Abbey house unfold.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this game a lot more than other games like it. It was challenging, but just when I was about give up, I found the answer. The only thing I would change about it is that it would be nice to have some kind of hint option. Can't wait for more levels!
B008G12ERC|5.0|First time I listened to this I was intrigued but confused. Some of the songs were definitely not what I was expecting. But I QUICKLY grew to love this album.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled is my new favorite book right now! Definitely one of the best of 2013 so far, hands down! Emma Chase's debut novel is witty, sexy, hot and all told from the male point of view. Scary. I know!<br /><br />Drew Evans. My new book boyfriend. I just love him. He's sexy, smart, cocky, arrogant, knows what he wants and goes after it. What he wants just happens to be Kate Brooks. She's perfect for him too! Like Obi Wan said, \\"You can not escape your destiny\\"! hmmm, maybe George Lucas was on to something!<br /><br />This book was completely original, had awesome characters, a unique storyline, priceless dialogue and was perfectly written. The Notebook references also won me over! Read it now or read it later, just read it. Come to the dark side people! You will not be disappointed. 5 fanfreakintastic stars!!! Can't wait for Twisted!<br /><br />[...]
B008O037RG|2.0|First, I'd like to say I'm a huge fan of Mumford.  Great music.  I got Babel earlier this year on CD and I have been listening to it non-stop.<br /><br />My boss has an amazing sound system.  All hand built, all tubes, designed for records.  Probably one of the nicer sound systems you'll come across.  Has lots of vinyls from back in the day (when music was good...).  We tossed this vinyl onto his system and it straight up didn't sound good.  Everything was real flat.  Seemed like it had been compressed way too much.  Tough to listen to at higher volumes.  Completely different from some of the older stuff he has.  While the Pink Floyd was warm and smooth and crisp at higher volumes, the Mumford was harsh and almost distorted.  The CD was MUCH better through his system.  It's a shame.  I can only imagine what a good quality record would've sounded like.<br /><br />Again, Mumford is awesome.  No complaints there.  Just don't buy this vinyl.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD has a lot of my favorite music and I'm enjoying it.  It was shipped quickly and exactly as described
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This album is best enjoyed loudly, with bass up and windows down on a sunny day in your car .
B000FA675C|5.0|Great characters for this masterpice  love is the fiction if you like this books read The templar legacy by Steve Berry..
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book was better than expected will read it again. No problems understanding the plot of the book. Hope for a second one.
B005HYNCTK|5.0|I alway thought that Bruckner symphonies are boring and I have serveral box sets of his complete symphonies and I purchasr the Bruno Walter edition and listened to few Bruckner symphonies it opened my eyes or ears,fanatic.I  bought this set and many rviewers say it is too slow.Well I really appreciate and now I understand how his themes of each movement progress so slowly that you will hardly notice.This is a set of deep contemplation that will bring to the heart of what Bruckner is saying not in word but in music.Just take time and listen to one movement at a time and give quality time to hear but listen and your apprecition will begin to grow.It  is not fast food and just like being a restaurant and order and each course will follow aand giving time to enjoy it before the next.I am not musically trained but I appreciate what is good.I order a wine,not the price,if i like  it is ok,not tasting like strawberry icream,come on it is grapes.Highly recommended to those pessimistist and buy it let your ears be the judge but MAKE TIME FOR IT..
B00001SIES|5.0|This album is one of my favorites by Muse. (So are all their other albums, but yeah.) No for real. This one is amazing. Old school Muse amazing.

0676978010|5.0|Shock therapy is so obvious to me in our domestic and foreign policies once I began reading &#34;The Shock Doctrine.&#34;  Reading it has been a mind and soul changing experience for me.  A must read!

B00632HWOG|5.0|I love it !!<br />It's easy and quick. But how do I delete spam from my Kindle (I need help) ?
B0000047CX|4.0|A good example of  their work---I enjoy it .<br />the liner notes were interesting, telling of how they came to work together and the almost serendipitous way in which Astrud came to play an important part in the development of their music.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Fun stuff. For cheap action that can keep you awake at night.<br />The price is right and you can't  go wrong with this one.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|I didn't have high exceptions for this movie.  All I had heard was that fans of the book were not happy.  Shocking(sarcasm).  I have never read the book and, really, I have no desire to.  I read Twilight series and watched the movies, though, I didn't particularly enjoy them too much (loathed the last book/movie). So, I suppose, I unfairly judged how The Host would be.  This movie isn't an action-packed scifi flick and it's not the extremely heavy-handed romance that Twilight was.  Instead, it's character-driven and I loved it because of that.  I grew attached to the Wanderer.  I thought the movie was well-acted and the plot was interesting.  I teared up near the end and cheered at the very end.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I think that the details on most of the puzzles have great definition. I have had this app for about two months and i enjoy it.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This book had me from the beginning. It truly made you aware of how societal issues can impact so much. It also gave a wonderful view of societal issues in India.  There are some similarities to western culture and thus this book highlighted ways that women continue to push forward to be seen for who they are.  It also showed how we as women have to be careful about being absent in our relationships because we get so caught up in taking care of the family and forget who we truly are and can be.  There was so much in this book it would take another book to pull things put.  This is a must read for anyone.  I like the fact that the book didn't have an expected end.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This was not nearly as good as previous books. So many characters, and it was confusing as to which character was narrating as the chapters changed.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As long as your imagination allows you to appreciate the extraordinary, you'll love this novel. If you're a fan of Neil Gaiman, you'll likely love this novel as well. It's a relatively quick read which will take you on an emotional rollercoaster and leave you mildly heartbroken when it's over. All told, you should just read it...RIGHT NOW!
0099503921|3.0|the book's cover seems too worn. And the its cover was too dirty. Anyway this book is okay for me.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|A classic indeed. Well written but a lot of plot structuring for such a quick and complete resolution. Simply too much suspense for all to be resolved in 10 pages or less; just my opinion.
B004IPPINW|2.0|I had higher expectations, since Oprah's book club recommended I read this before seeing the movie. Was so disappointed I'll pass on the movie. Bleh.
B009POCG0Y|3.0|Matthew McConaughey fans will rate this film higher than it should be rated and that's O.K. because McConaughey does show his range. Thomas Haden Church and Gina Gershon's talents are wasted in this film.  Gina's physical talents are shown more in the opening scenes that ever before which isn't bad because she is still a beautiful woman but her acting talent is again wasted. Either the story is weak or the screenwriter who rewrote the story needs more imagination because good actors are trying to holdup a half-filled inflatable swimming pool with predictable results. The depiction of Dallas, Texas is from the 1950s even though the writer or director wants the viewer to believe it's modern-day. Barely three stars. Could have been a hell-of a-movie but it wasn't....
0345803485|5.0|Wow. Just an amazing start to a trilogy!!! I finally caved in and ordered this book after many friends raved about it. First off, it's a VERY sexy, risqué, romance novel. I found it so good that before I finished it, I got back online and order the 2nd book, Fifty Shades Darker, so I would have it before I finished the first!!! So glad I did!!!! I would have cried if I didn't already have the 2nd one. Getting ready to start the 3rd and final, Fifty Shades Freed. Without a doubt my favorite books ever! Read them now, they're already casting for the movie!!! ;) I end this with a quote from the book...<br />Laters, Baby
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I simply love this series. I am a history fan and very much enjoy watching shows, movies, etc about British aristocracy.  The blatant over indulgence and superiority over others is such a sociatal concept to me. I would definately recommend this series.  I love how the family of the house and the servants of the house live such separate and combined lives.  A definate must see.
0765334798|3.0|It was an amusing read. I enjoy Scalzi's work, but this one wasn't my favorite. It wasn't bad by any means, but it just didn't grab me.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's easy to use and updates often. I wish I could close the panel on the right side though.Thanks. That's 20
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I picked up [[ASIN:B008JGSM6G Flow Free]] for the grandsons to play when they visit.  Much to my surprise, I played it to test it out and it's quite enjoyable!  It's fun to play when I want to take a quick break.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was very suspenseful up to the last page. Another winner by David Baldacci.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Needed a basic calculator on my Kindle fire. This app. fit the bill. Easy to use and does what I expected
0312340958|4.0|Had seen Karen Armstrong on Oprah and felt compelled to read about her. Enjoyed the book and am now reading The Spiral Staircase. Loved reading about her journey as a nun. She gave an inside perspective of what is involved. I have passed it along already and would definitely recommend it to others.
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|very fun and good cast. 4 out of 5  star movie  glad the had Ewan McGregor and Stanley Tucci in it
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Its up there with Hunger Games for me. It was captivating! The way it was written was beautiful!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The movie was so interesting, entertaining and informative, I bought the book from which it was adapted (&#34;Lincoln, Team of Rivals&#34;)<br />Worth the watch for history buffs and all Daniel Day-Lewis fans (and Abraham Lincoln fans too!)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my 3 year old loves it she plays it all the time<br />has a lot of fun playing games  good game
0307476073|4.0|Wild was a beautiful, insightful, at times moving & at other times funny, read. I could identify with the author (have not walked the PCT, but spent much of the mid-90s road-tripping & camping solo in the southwest). Ms Strayed is a truly gifted writer (I love Dear Sugar as well). The only thing that bothered me was -- and I am sure her publisher pressured her to do this -- the story arc comes across a bit too intentionally & because of that i had a little bit of trouble believing the order of a few of her trail stories.  No matter, it did create suspense, and i ended up reading pages 100-320 in one sitting because of this arc. I also had difficulty w/ the ending. The way it is written it makes it seem like the trail healed her completely & 7 years later she met a great guy etc. I am certain that life did not suddenly turn around after the PCT... again, i am sure her publisher or editors urged her to create a clean arc. Overall a fantastic read. Highly recommend.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Beautiful and well written. I think anyone who is thinking of adopting should read this book. Made me laugh and cry.
B005DNO7MQ|4.0|It will never get old. A powerful movie. still worth the watch with enough blood, sweat and tears to please the whole family.
1781162646|5.0|This was a great novel to read. It was not the typical Stephen King you were used to. It was a great read although short!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story moved slowly in the beginning of the book where some parts were a bit long and drawn out.  However, it held my interest.
B00A27X972|5.0|This story helped confirm my \\"glass half full\\" attitude towards my life.  If you read this story you will feel better about the very gift that life is.  I was sorry to see it end.
B007FXLZ9K|5.0|Thanks to Steve McQueen we see actors really digging in and exploring the darkest corners of their being, and presenting astonishing performances. Not for everyone. &#34;Family movie&#34; lovers, stay away! This is for adults (very mature) adults who aren't afraid ( or prudish) to think and examine another world that isn't so rosy. Because after all, life is not always rosy. Love it for the acting.
B00C5UV3YU|5.0|I love the DVD it's has all the number one hits by the best selling female group it's a must have if your a fan of dc4 and dc3
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|I really wish Amazon would give an age range for their apps.  I don't like trying stuff out first to see if my 3 year old can do it by her self.<br />This one she cannot.  But my mom loves it, and my 3yo likes to watch.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging enough to keep you interested. The graphics are clear and the concepts of the scenes are creative. I really enjoy the game.
0425263924|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the story of Gideon and Eva so much!  I was a 50 Shades fan, but I do believe I am hooked now on the Crossfire Series.  Entwined with You was a great read and I do hope there will be a 4th book soon.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I don't play the games . It was useful when I first got the kindle - to practice navigation but I don't use it any more.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|She can keep at it for plenty of time to get dinner ready.  Distracts her for a good 20 min a time.  It's not an all day every day game, but it works too keep her occupied for just the right amount of time.  She can do it herself with out our help.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie. I used it for educational purposes. Great Quality. fast shipping. Good price. I would recommend product to everyone!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|U laugh out loud, you cry...<br />Since I read it I now have a great love for the avett brothers too :))
B008K6HN8I|2.0|Not useful for me. I don't have a smart phone and it doesn't work on the kindle. I downloaded in error.
B004SBULWE|1.0|great for my smart phone.  Don't need it for fire.  Not sure why it an option.  I would not bother
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Great movie. Used it to accompany the play Doubt. Good quality. Even better movie. Worked out really well. Would recommend this product.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I did not get it make it better so next time you write a book make sure people understand it
B004XISI4A|5.0|it just gets better and better. Daeneries vs the IRON kingdom bring it on, the next sequel is going to be a shitstorm!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this. Not too hard but challenging enough. Wish there were more levels.  Great for a free app.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|this is children's awesome paly with it and I hsve fun with it if I get bored with it and once awhile playing for cutting hairs!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|My husband loves this movie and uses certain scenes to demonstrate to friends his home movie/sound system.  The blu-ray was exactly as represented, fairly priced, fast delivery... couldn't have asked for more!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I think the acting was pretty good.  The story was ok.  I think you should see trailer first.  I'm glad I didn't pay more for the film.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Pretty much kept repeating the same things happening over and over just a different scene.  Liked the twist at the end, but didn't get the ending.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is awesome and I hope that the creators of this game add more guns but so far this game is off the hook awesome<br />.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Again, I have every episode of Bones to date.  Inasmuch as TV is a wasteland, I always enjoy my DVDs
B000HF6ZR0|3.0|I think the film is worth the cost but see trailer first.  The suspense was there, the acting was ok, and the story was interesting.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Great action and kept you at the edge of your seat. Would recommend it to anyone who likes a good movie.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I recommend this book to very good readers for this book is a bit complicated to understand. Very good didn't understand dome parts but I like it
B003L77G8I|5.0|I have every episode of Bones to date.  Inasmuch as there is very little of any consequence to watch on TV, I use my DVDs extensively.
B0020M99LC|5.0|The acting is good.  The action is awesome.  The story is wonderful.  Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond ever.  I think the film is well worth the money.  You must watch the others: Quantum of Solace and Skyfall.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I can't write a review that does this book justice. My heart strings have never been yanked on like this ever before. Best book I've read in a long time!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Very much like TF2! But I like TF2,so that's ok! Some people have very OP weapons but if you can afford diamonds it's worth the gold weapons. I do wish there was a medic button like the real TF2, but it's still fun nonetheless. If you like TF2, WW2, or team FPS games you will like this a lot !
193700788X|2.0|After reading reviews on this book I ALMOST didnt order it but the simple fact that I have read the whole series made me do it. :).<br />I think everyone who has read the series can agree ...Her last 3 books/ deal was a waste! She pretty much gave up her self on Sookie.<br /><br />AND if in the end Charlaine wanted Sookie to end up with someone that the entire time she had no connection with physically or emotionally as she says over and over \\"she knew how it would end\\" Well then her last 3 books could have lead up to it but we all know they didn't. I honestly thought that Eric would KICK A** and be with her in the end but you know the man that has been a power house, no back down, defying the politics type guy ended up being a scared puppy going away with his tail between his legs to end it.<br /><br />Highly disappointed in the ending but I do love her writing so I will read more of her books to come.
B003AVPV1O|3.0|No fault of the very well made product, but the splitter was not suitable for using a single monitor for two computers. An A-B switch that also enables keyboard and mouse sharing turned out to be the ideal solution. Hope I can return this for refund.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game very addicting and amusingly and funny I love the minions. nothing else to say so lamznbvbvmcHzbxbhzdhhxu xxx  cixjxhcuccickxjhxvzghc
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|i choose this movie because iy seemed really funny and its  not its hiliarious  and  its for a very rrasonable price
B005HSL626|5.0|Another fun free game for my 8 year old daughter.  This is one of her favorites that was recommended by a friend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you will love it&bull; you don't need to buy things in the game to enjoy it. adults and kids alike will enjoy.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|We don't subscribe to HBO or any premium channels. My husband read the books and really like them so we thought we buy the CD's. He said it really closely followed the books and that HBO did a great job.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|i have not taken a lot of pictures wit it but ones i have turned out fine some thing i will use
B00CO52NLI|5.0|My daughter loves this game.  She has been playing it for weeks.  She is 8 and wants to be a vet.<br />You can purchase additional animals.  Which we have. (the dogs and cats).  As she processes adoptions she earns stars to purchase items to decorate the shelter.  She loves taking care of these animals.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|It was so funny my Grandson and I laughed till our tummy's hurt. He loved it and it was a very fun movie.
B005LAII9O|5.0|5 Stars goes to any movie deserving of watching more than once....this is one of those movies. Suspends disbelief...unpredictable script...action packed in a credible delivery. Great acting and direction. For viewers that like gritty action movies that are more credible than fiction.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|A very hard game to play i have trouble what i think are matched tiles are not so you get frustrated quickly
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I really liked the show, the series, and for the most part everything that Tom Selleck is in. He does a great Job of trying to fight off an addiction . Great Actor, Great Show
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Nice game for the right price. It's the best rpg I've played yet on the kindle. Not to happy about the cash spending part but everybody has their gimic.
0802130208|3.0|Before I read this book I read some reviews. A lot of reviewers thought it was a big big comedy, including Walker Percy. I didn't get that. It really wasn't all that funny. I got that it was a scathing attack on modern America. Mr. Toole hated everything and everybody. He hated gays, lesbians, white people, white prostestants, religion, religious hymns, Southern colleges, New York City, college professors,old people,young people,sex,women,mothers,fathers,capitalism,the I've got to have everything mentality of middle class America, etc, etc. Of course the book is about the author himself. Hating everything and everybody will cause sadness. And then depression. And then suicide. This book is way too sad to be a comedy. I give it three stars and doubt that it deserves that many.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I chose this rating because after I read this book I new how Greg felt.<br />  I liked this book because it really funny how Greg plays tricks on Rowley.<br />  And I would recommend this book to family and friends
B006AKIGUU|5.0|If you like vinyl... this is a must own! This is the Birth of Cool, Miles Davis. How can any serious music fan not own this? I had a dinner party and put this bad boy on, everyone loved it. Took the party to a whole new level. Ah the sweet sound of Miles on vinyl. There's nothing like it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I played this game once and I HATED IT!!!!! The first one is MUCH better....I suggest not getting it....What's up with the zip lines anyways?
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Thanks to the author. I was pleasantly surprised on how good of a read this book is,  I look forward to reading mode of this tale.
159463176X|2.0|I read both of the author's earlier books and loved them. This book jumps from one  set of characters to another. The stories tie together at the end but for me in an unsatisfying way.
B008602KQI|5.0|One that I will keep and enjoy watching more than once.  I am ready for the second installment of the trilogy.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|The game is not even close to what I thought it would be. It was like a really dumb temple run and everything cost too much
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The big fish games have better graphics and puzzles for the same price. Also, it did not take very long.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I ordered it for my kids. They love it and have seen it many times. They also like the 2nd disc.
B004SIP7F8|1.0|For the life of me, I will never understand how this movie won a best picture award. I've tried to watch it several times assuming I'm missing something. When I think of worst movies of all time, this one always comes to mind. I can only assume that the movie won awards due to cronyism in Hollywood.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Didn&#34;t get a chance to see it at the theater, but this is a strong cast, and well acted movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good fun, does need more floors. Does keep attention and is hard enough to make you think but not too hard.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Loved the movie and had to buy it. Nice unexpected twist to the ending. I enjoy watching Daniel Radcliffe.excellent movie.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|Good sequel to Casino Royale. Not a fan of the torture scene though. That was too graphic for me. Could have toned it down a bit.
0062255657|5.0|A 40+yr old man returns to his hometown after many years away for a funeral and finds himself walking down memory lane.  Down a lane with the ocean at the end of it and memories long since repressed and forgotten about things that sound impossible but aren't really.  About monsters and madness, oceans and other worlds, love and loss.  For a while, he leaves the outside world behind and remembers it all.<br /><br />This is such a quiet book that you don't even realize how much time has gone by until something suddenly snaps you back into reality and you look down to see how much of the book you have read except you haven't read it, you have been swallowed by it mind and soul.  You can't wait to steal a few more minutes to dive into it again only to find yourself emerging an hour later.  Not a long read by any means but I found myself reading it slowly to savor it.  It doesn't want to be rushed but rather wants to quietly unfurl and draw you in...and you want to let it.
4789004546|5.0|This book is a great aid for all basic grammar questions you might have. This book is very usefull as a supplement to any beginner course or study. I have a private on-line tutor and this book helps me with my homework and beyond. I study Japanese so that I can understand Japanese movies. At the very start from zero this book is very hard to decipher but when you get to verb conjugations you will love this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the perfect alarm clock for me.  Since I read myself to sleep each night I always have my Kindle Fire next to me.  Adding the app made perfect sense.  I like that I can select from so many ring-tones as my wake up sound and I love that I can set it to start at a low volume and gradually increase.  The Kindle may also be shaken to silence the alarm, there are snooze features and much more.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was waiting for this to come out and it didn't disappoint.  After the excitement faded the story was good but a lot like the first two, I was looking for a bit more drama.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this type of game. This one works well. I hope they come out with new levels soon. Please.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the convenience of purchasing my ebooks with my kindle ap.  Paper products are a thing of the past for the most part.
0345529057|5.0|Loved the books, loved the set.  Paperbacks in general aren't my favorite because of the size of the print, however the cost of this set is less than one hardback volume.  For fans of Game of Thrones on HBO, this is a MUST have and read.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Great story. Didn't have any idea that it would end that way. Can't wait to read another of Garland books
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|Jason Statham is the best , Robert Deniro is old and still working. this is only a movie . you make ratting items so hard and time come summing I will not rate anthoght item.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I started reading this after I caught up with A Song of Ice and Fire, with some recommendations from friends. It took a little while for me to get used to it, but I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. The biggest thing that I had to adjust to was the scale of everything. Magic, Ascendants, soldiers and cities, and how they all relate to each other in terms of scale took me a while to wrap my head around, since the magic system is so different.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app was useful and easy to read and navigate for multiple locations.  Since the change, it's worthless!! Very disappointing!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I could play this for hours when I am killing time. I am retired (disabled) so most of what I do is killing time. Could do with a few less commercials. I know I can cancel them but it aggravating.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show. Didn't start watching until last week and have been watching and episode or two a day. The language is s little hard to understand at times. The time period is so interesting. I'm amazed at the number if inventions in the last 100 years!
1612680011|3.0|Good book for motivation on investing especially real estate investment and also good motivation to get into the habit of saving money.  Nothing else much can be gained from this book.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|This game is fun and addictive, but only thing is I wish that they made it when you turn sharper and faster because sometimes I see a crate but can't get to it in time. Other than that great game!
B0045HCJ94|5.0|This is a though film with excellent performances and a great adaptation of Edward Albee piece. You have to be in a good mood to appreciate it till the end. But I recommend it strongly.<br />Ivonne-Uruguay
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Needed help calculating how much fabric I needed ... took out the kindle and took care of the problem in an instant
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was happy with this case.. then we had a car fire, losing everything that we had taken on a week-long camping trip.  Our gas tank exploded after we had gotten out... the firefighters arrived, put out the fire,... and handed us our Kindle from inside the car.  Unbelievable... it still worked!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is sick. I love every part of it and it is connected to the new movie. its so much fun challenging your friends and is worth getting.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is a great movie is awesome. It is extremely entertaining. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Gregory Peck
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great movie; not just for kids. If you liked Finding Nemo, this is for you. The whole story is fun; great animation and music.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was almost better than the first!  I couldn't stop reading it, couldn't put it down. I can't wait to get the next one!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The DVD arrived in perfect condition and the show is so good we are so excited to have this added to our collection...can't wait for the next one to come out.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|My now 8 year old received this gift for her birthday.  She makes up imaginary scenarios, with all her Lego characters! She loves it & so do I, it keeps things in a tidy & neat space☺
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome season, love the all of the twists in this season and especially the twist in the last episode. Love the character development and story line.
B008CPRLP2|5.0|Works great n its free it took me a little not to find out after I unzipped my first file, but it pretty easy to figure out
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Like the LoR movies this is visually awesome and quite  entertaining.  Just lackas a bit of panache and i really expected more.  I want this movie to be 6 stars on a 5 star scale and am even reluctant to give 4.  worth seeing/owning/etc.  but not anywhere near a list of best or favorite movies ever.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Puzzles are fun and challenging. Each level offers something new to make you think. I would definitely recommend this game.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Love Gideon and Eva. Like their story and the fact they are now married.  The ending was left open for the next book, so the saga continues.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story takes a number of twists and turns and keeps you guessing unti the end.  Once it got going, I couldn't put it down.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Well, I just stepped up to a &#34;Smart Phone&#34; and I really like Amazon Kindle for Android.  I also have a Kindle Fire and I really like everything Amazon has to offer.  They are a GREAT COMPANY!!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|The movie was alright. I don't have children, but my friends raved about this movie. I enjoy animated movies and I got it here at a good price. I am of Scottish descent and I liked the accents and the basic story.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|i loved this it gave you not only the eagles music as a group but music done by the members after the broke up
B00005JSGK|5.0|product was what i was looking for and was in great condition will be looking for more  of these movies
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I just can't wait for the fourth season to begin. I plan to continue purchasing every season. It is the best series I have EVER watched.
B000J3OTSM|3.0|Bought it inexpensively here. Glad I didn't pay a lot. It was alright. Nothing special. Typical boy meets girl story. Dancing was interesting (for someone who has no dance background).
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|this is a great series it gave you a history of how the eagles began the trial they went through as a group to get to and the people they lost and gained to become the great group they are now.  would recommend this to any fan for their collection
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It's very funny and entertaining. I enjoy watching the character's relationships develop as well as the cases being solved.  Everyone should be hooked on this show by now.
B0081336FO|5.0|I like the episodes and  wish there were more season's to watch, I think it was well done and should continue.
1401937268|1.0|There are not enough words to describe how much this is NOT a Tarot Deck,<br /><br />Does this woman not have enough money? It is like she pumps out a deck of cards every 6 months.<br /><br />The energy of the Tarot system has been completely manipulated and sugar coated which does more harm than good for the system and tool.<br /><br />Another deck of art that she has not created. (The art is at least pretty but shallow) Another deck of fluffy messages and very little depth.<br /><br />Horrid.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|excellent absolutely loved it would recommend this to any eagle fans for their collections.  this is my second copy of this.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the Crossfire series. I could read them forever. I've read 50 shades as well, and this is not relatable. I will forever love 50 shades. This book is a fun short read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had heard so much about this series so decided to order it and LOVE it!  It is so good! I would highly recommend it!
B008MIMWOO|4.0|You just cant go wrong with all 3 of these movies.. and the price was right for blu-ray.  The downfall was no movie features, but i guess i can live with out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am still new to apps but wanted a book I saw on Amazons list for Kindle, so I did it. I downloaded the Kindle app onto my inexpensive tablet. Wow, does the app run smoothly and it even takes me back to the page I was on when I stopped reading.I recommend this app to android users. I really like how it works and I also like shopping with Amazon. I am 66 years of age..If I can do it, you can too.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Interesting to read a book from a dog's perspective. A little heartbreaking at times but overall, an enjoyable story to read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved it EXCEPT for the shocking ending!  It took me days to quit thinking about it. I wish it could have ended in a different way. So sad. I am eagerly awaiting Season 4!
B0036G1T78|4.0|good movie will watch again someday. neat to see NYC back in the seventies. robert redford, spies, twenty one words worth of stuff
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This app would be very useful if it actually worked I downloaded this about 2 or 3 days ago and I keep trying to play ANY video and I will not work it keeps saying youtube has stoped and I have to press ok and it doesn't work at all and I would really like to use this app so you guys really have to update this soon.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just finished reading this book on my kindle. What a great story! There were some twists that I wasn't expecting. A great read!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|wish there were more extra feature on the Blue Ray. Not sure what to do with the extra disk boo
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I found these tunes very soft and soothing. In fact, they help me sleep through my husband's snoring and whatever strange noises happen to be coming from my son's room!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Love the new enhancements.  Bonus material is good, wish there was more actual bloopers. But love the movies. ..  .
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I have been a fan of Bourdain for a long time, since the first No Reservations, and this is Bourdain at his best!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Wish there were more extra features or behind the scenes stuff. Not really worth the amount of money paid boo
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun and cute i love to play it every time  minion so cute and *beep* that all
B001AQR3JY|5.0|It's fun to watch and the adults enjoy it also. Have watched it more than once and will watch it again.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Covering the full history of the Beatles, this stereo reproduction is excellent. It brings back fond memories of them visiting Melbourne and will provide endless listening pleasure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was sad to find out that this great mind game only had 10 levels! I would love to find more great games like this.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I wanted to read this book before I watched the movie.  It was good but unexpectedly.  The short stories format made it longer than expected
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|Not much good as the plot which used to be pretty simple with these is no longer the success of this franchise used to be clear cut simple plots with the characters complicating the twists this one was all plot and the characters appeared to be almost irrelevant.
B00123NWEA|5.0|This is a must have. All of the tracks are classic mainstream Jazz. You rarely hear Jazz this good played anywhere these days, so this CD is a best bet.<br />Only recently did I listen to the title track from Jazz with Bob Parlocha on the FM Radio and that guy really knows his stuff. So give it a listen. You will not be disappointed.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This solitaire mahjong game is definitely one of the better ones out there. I really like the fact that there's a detailed instruction on the game when you first begin--so those who don't know how to play solitaire mahjong, you won't be lost after reading the instructions. There are three different styled tiles you can choose along with quite a few background images. There's also a ton of different types of boards for you to choose from, like turtle and zoo.<br /><br />The graphics are great and the sound is nice and not really overbearing (but if it gets annoying, there's a mute button). There are also hints if you get stuck and that add five seconds to the clock each time you use them. The pause button does pause the time (as I see another reviewer hasn't updated their review when the pause didn't actually stop time, but that's been fixed). The leaderboard is nice, though I don't really use this option in games.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful game to play with a lot of options to choose from. For $1, it's the perfect price for anyone who loves the solitaire version of mahjong. I don't see any issues on my kindle fire. I would definitely recommend this game.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|Not sure why, but after unpacking remote(it was new in pkg.)I followed the instructions plugged the remote into the wireless dongle to charge it. After 2seconds it showed the remote was charged. Great!! Not so much. I unplugged the remote and it wouldnt work. So I try again and let it charge overnight. Nothing!!! The controller would not turn on at all. The only way it would work, was plugged in. That would have been ok , but the circle button was getting stuck. This is the reason I wanted to replace my PS 3 remote. Out of the box like this is unexcusible. I would not take a chance on this remote or any 3rd party remotes for that matter
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Eventually I will give in and buy the entire series.  Men and women alike will be drawn in by Martin's excellent writing and enthralling tales/
B000I9YV30|5.0|Love this movie, it's one of our favorites.  Lot of language, but shows what young boys go through from lesser families and how young boys think and act.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I love that I can have both my iPod and droid plugged in at the same time. Great to have for a trip. I did some research and the reviews helped my decision to buy this particular one, glad I did.
B0047SF41G|4.0|Predators has great production value, good action and decent actors. Brody as the lead is the only real weak link. Definitely worth owning. Fans of the franchise wont be disappointed.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Whenever Kathy Reichs writes another Temperance Brennan novel, I have to read it.  Although different, I follow the TV series and read all her books.  The characters seem real and very human.  Fun reading.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Nothing to help you; very frustrating but I like a challenge so I am trying.  Never going to pay for clues.  Don't like games that require money.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|A lot of folks believed this film was destined to fail. From the release delay of six months, to the rewrite of the entire third act, it looked as though the adaptation of the popular novel would turn out to be a massive failure, almost to the tune of $200 million. However, despite these problems, not to mention the extensive reshoots and rumors of heavy disputes between the director and lead star, World War Z is an entertaining and smart epidemic thriller that boasts a strong lead performance from Brad Pitt and some eerily intense action sequences.<br /><br />The story revolves around former U.N. employee Gerry Lane (played by Pitt) in a race against time as a deadly and mysterious pandemic threatens to wipe out the human population. While the world struggles to hold on, Lane traverses the globe in a search to discover the origin of the disease in hopes of creating a cure.<br /><br />I have to say, I didn't have strong hopes for this film. I'm in the minority of people who didn't enjoy the book, and after reading about all the issues during production, I was expecting this to be a total flop. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the movie for myself, however, as the production team made some great choices that ultimately saved the film from being a disaster. From what I've read, the entire third act was redone, and is one of the strongest parts of the movie. Instead of the original ending finding Gerry in a massive showdown with millions of zombies in Russia, the rewritten script leads our protagonist to Cardiff, Whales in a much smaller, and creepy, setting. This leads to a much more intense climax that is a welcome break from the absolutely massive set pieces earlier in the film.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, Pitt is very good here, not only as the smart and resilient U.N. worker, but also as the caring father and husband who ultimately just wants his family to be safe. His wife, played by Mireille Enos, is also very good in the movie, although I think she could have been given more to do.<br /><br />Overall I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. Don't believe all the negative news that came along with this movie; do yourself a favor and see it for yourself.uld have been given more to do.<br /><br />Overall I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this film.

B00B7Y0206|3.0|It worked fine when i got it. Now it's force closing when I sign into my account. I can't watch the videos I am subscribed to.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I haven't encountered any glitches or problems. The game play is challenging and doesn't get boring. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Play this like army of darkness<br />I would totally listen to me this game is amazing you half to buy this game now
B006LSZECO|2.0|From the begginig this was a page turner and I was intrigued by the authors style. Unfortunately, I was equally disappoted in her almost irresponsible attempt at an ending.<br />Its as though I got trcked into trying a new restaurant by its atmosphere and service only to be let down by the actual meal.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|I wish I knew John Locke paid for reviews before I bought this book.  Good job gaming the system, John.  But to charge people for this illegitimate advice is just shameful.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love this game  the best in the world<br />I like how it has multiplayer so we could finish levels together
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love angry birds. It is fun and challenging. I even have my favorite bird picked out and root for!
1432794426|5.0|I do not know what took me so long to purchase  this book!  BUY IT!  You will not regret it! I think the others have said enough!  BUY IT!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I usually don't follow TV shows and I just happened to stumble across Downton Abbey and I became hooked.  I absolutely love this show and it's characters.  Hated how season 3 ended but greatly anticipating the start of season four!
0783116934|5.0|Plain and simple: This is a wonderful movie... AND ... The good guys win.<br />I wish it would get released in Blu Ray.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake is an amazing person and singer. I loved all his songs and listened to it repeatedly. His exposure on the Voice has made a lot of people aware of his wonderful personality.
0316247545|5.0|I was very impressed by the quality of this this book. Simply from a physical perspective, this book is good looking and solidly put together. The design and construction of the cover is top notch (what is under the jacket makes the book look like something you would find in Twilight Sparkle's library), and what is between the covers is well-composed and well organized. This book contains encyclopedic information about the Friendship is Magic television series (through the 3rd season), including the world of Equestria, the characters, the plots of each and every episode, the songs, and some great commentary from the creators. This book may be the best MLP: FiM merchandise for the money I've purchased.<br /><br />The only downside is that when new episodes/movies are released, this book will become obsolete. However, if the next book is of this quality, I wouldn't mind purchasing it too.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I loved the song &#34;It's Time&#34; when I heard it during The Perks of Being a Wallflower trailer. Then &#34;Radioactive&#34; came out and I wasn't quite sure that I would like the rest of the album. &#34;Demons&#34; sealed the deal for me. Imagine Dragons is wonderful. I was really pleased with the entire album and can see several other singles coming. &#34;Every night&#34; &#34;Top of the World&#34; These songs get in my head, stay there, and I like it.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is good entertainment for a good share of peoplr. Have watched each eisode multiple times and enjoyed each one.Can watch again and again.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|As a life-long student of American Film, I see this as a contemporary gem and a storytelling textbook. Unabashed and sometimes as stupid as life it's self. Big time violence, so not for kiddos.
1440503257|5.0|my husband loves this cookbook has already been using recipes and they have all tasted great . this would make a great gift.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was an interesting read, but an old story line, very predictable.  However, I would recommend the book if you enjoyed reading.  &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, and &#34; A Thousand Splendid Sons&#34;.  &#34;A Thousand Splendid Sons&#34; was my favorite.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really LOVED this ap until today.  They decided to upgrade the ap and make it &#34;better.&#34;  I HATED the new interface.  All the information that had been so easy to find and understand were now obscured by mounds of *stuff *.  What had been easy to navigate was now difficult. What had been pleasant was now - annoying as anything you might imagine.  I did not give it much of a chance.  I HATED IT AND WOULD NEVER ACCEPT IT.  Within 45 seconds of encountering this abomination it was removed from my Kindle.<br /><br />Grade F,<br />Epic Fail.<br />Totally useless.<br />JUNK!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing. I have no worlds that express how I felt throughout this book. This story was truly inspirational and showed the true story of a troubled teen. Definitely reading this book again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its fun and it keeps you on your toes with divirse obsticules never seen before in other games. Never does this game leech you wanting more
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Halcyon is a wonderful album full of meaningful tracks. Ellie's unique style of indie/synth/folk pop portrays emotion through music in an experience entirely new to me.<br /><br /> This album, technically her second, is much more electronically charged than her first, but not in a bad way. Ms. Goulding's progression into more digital sounds is only natural, but she still maintains the key elements that set her first album apart from the rest.<br /><br />Ellie's vocal range, unique way with words, and emotionally charged lyrics make this album something special.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|as u can see it is a lot better than temple run the first but I like it a lot more also
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is a really fun time-management game. There are several different restaurants with plenty of levels. The game runs smoothly every time. No glitches.  FAVE!
B00CISC2DA|5.0|As a fan of Boards of Canada, this album hits me in all the right places.  I highly recommend it to fans of Geogaddi and Music Has the Right to Children.  It might not be the best entry point in the Boards of Canada catalog for newcomers due to its slightly darker nature.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius has an awesome voice but every song on this cd is great where you get one or two this one is great
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was so good I could not put it down.  If I did just to rest for a minute.  I would soon have it in my hands again.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Another great season...not sure i can wait for season 4!  The suspense is unreal.  Makes me want to got to England to visit the set
B00CWY76CC|5.0|You really have to look at every corner. Can be a problem if you have Color recognition problems. My wife had to turn the dials, punch the bottoms or what ever else needed to beat the color tests. Don't t leave the rooms unfinished there is no save and you start at the beginning of your room again. Good game!!
1455875724|5.0|I have to call bias on this review first as I have been a fan of Google for a long time. It was Google's view of information and mobile that made me decide to major in Computer Science. That being said, I have to say that it always infuriated me when people, out of fear, would cry out that Google was somehow some nefarious behemoth corporation out to steal your information and sell it to evil people. I weighed that bias carefully while reading this book to make sure I was not out to &#34;prove&#34; anything, but take an objective look into the inner workings of the innovating giant. Google is so much more than search. They are innovating in a way that most of us only dream possible. Greatly uninhibited by the bottom line, they want to make the Web a pleasant place for all and their business model, maybe accidentally but nonetheless, insures that people's happiness are what matter most. If anyone knows the truth it's Steven as he has spent many years on the inside and in this book reports the foundation of what values, inspirations and future goals the people who work at Google carry. Not to mention you will get an insider's look into how the machine runs, augmenting any business you may plan to do online in the future. If you have a pulse you should read this book.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love a well-told story -- and this version of Emma was a joy to watch.  I have loved the BBC remakes of Austen's classic books.  Well done.
B0096HL33G|3.0|For all of us who have experienced toxic relationships, and terrible endings.<br />No wonder there is no follow up to either life. Well done, Dark.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|it was just ok... was expecting to be better. maybe if i watched it at night it would be scary
B001JIDE3M|4.0|It's a cute movie that kept my attention and that if my 6 and 7 year olds. We like the Journey movies. Not sure how plausible it is (not at all), but the science factoids in the movie were accurate. That's a bonus for this teacher/mom. .)
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and thus far have enjoyed all the movies they have made based on his novels. This may be my favorite though! I hate that it got terrible reviews, truly does not reflect the movie, it's wonderfully romantic.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is pretty fun but you need gems for many of the extras. There is a lot that you can do with your horse and this game will help you waste hours of time.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app leaves Google Reader in the dust. It's cleaner, leaner and very visual. The sliding panels are smooth and fluid. I use Freely many times each day.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|addictive .....more levels please....great application for free...did I say...more levels please..thanks for the app. would have given 10 if more levels
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Great movie, my husband and I (almost 40) really enjoyed it. It hits very close to home and had us laughing throughout. We loved it. It saddens me it didn't get better reviews in the box office.
B00957T6X6|4.0|These books are great, definitely a must read, but I wish for the 5 book bundle they just gave you access to the 5 separate e-books instead of one huge one. Sort of like how if you buy the 5 real-book bundle you get 5 separate books instead of one large one.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This Mahjong game is the best one out there!  Huge variety of puzzles and options.  Works perfectly on my Kindle Fire.  Thank you!
B00B23O96A|5.0|great album
B00BJS7104|5.0|I love Jamie Foxx, I didn't think he could do better than his performance in Ray. I have to say though that I loved him in this movie. Actually all the actors outdone themselves! It is a Quentin Tarantino, so be prepared for bloodshed, and as always, lots of it. If you like his films though you will not be let done! Loved the comedy Jamie Foxx brought to it though.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It is not that bad not too shabby but sometimes will not update. Please update this real soon. Thank You
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|A very well done movie and as close to the book and I could see given how long the books is. My only argument aginst it is the fact that they killed 2 Chareters in the movie that did not die in the book. Aaron and Brandt. Otherwise very well done indeed.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Since the shutdown of Google Reader, I had considered Feedly as my best partner to keep me update of my favorite news feds.<br /><br />I always get my breakfast looking feedly, That's my lovely way to start my day
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A must see. One both male and female, nerds and cool kids all will enjoy. You don't have to be a fan of the original television series to enjoy either.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Last year I bought my husband tickets to see the 50th anniversary tour in Lake Tahoe.  It was a fabulous concert and the perfect birthday gift for him.  So when I saw that the CD was coming out I had to buy it for him for Father's Day.  He absolutely loves it and so do I.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I love how real life is portrayed and the drama of change.  The love story is just one part of the drama.  The imagination of a future where we do this to Earth and life becomes so fragile is almost too possible.  I am excited to go to the next chapter of the story and find out what now.  Keep them coming.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Hilarious movie, great performances and lots of great music. Love the underlying love story. A movie both myself, my husband and my tween girls all enjoyed.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is ok but sometimes won't load pictures or update the news feed. Please update this ASAP. Thank you very much
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once you start watching you want to know what next.  Can't wait until middle of Sept. for Season 4 to see who does what.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It only has like 15 minutes before it says trial period has ended. It really needs infant time for it to be really good.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app for my Kindle. Can't say I like it as well as the full version, but as far as apps go, if you're a woman, you've got to have Pinterest.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I really love you guys since 2012. You guys just rock on. Kudos. Lastpass here to stay forever and ever.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It says I can't download it.  I tried because I can't seem to get facebook  on the old app any more.  Why??
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Can believe how much i can fit in this pack. It looks small but i can fit my camera, 3 lenses and the rest of my stuff
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I was not thrilled, but my girls did enjoy the movie. It's a renter, not one that I would buy and add to my movie library. Just okay in my book.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|This app on the install section told me that it does not have a native code for the app. Trio Stealth Lite
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|I would recommend this book! It's a great read. There are a few twists and turns you won't see coming.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Cryptically prophetic, considering the probably never-to-be-explained mid east embassy tragedies.  And when I dwell on Snowden's<br />plight, a bottom line hope emerges, 'God bless America.'
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie is rarely better than the book in my opinion, and this remained true for this movie. Don't get me wrong - the movie is still a thriller and has a great plot, but it will never compare to the book.<br />Beware of the violent plot line if you are sensitive to that type of thing.<br />Keeps you on the edge of your seat and pulls your emotions in all different directions simultaneously.<br />Great for those who like action/adventure - is a bit syfy as well.
B00821OX98|5.0|If you're a syfi junkie you'll love this series! It has a great balance between greety war battle and the human condition in the midst of an alien invasion. Brilliant!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it so much I used to have a ipod but kindle does not update so fast<br />But not as good as pc
0345803507|5.0|This third book in the trilogy kept me enthralled and tied up the story very well.  Wish there were more!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|A reasonably funny movie that is suitable to watch with your parents/mildly sensitive audience. Much better than most multiple high profile actor movies.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Sound quality is terrible. Sometimes, when Kanye is \\"singing\\", he is so off-key that it's unbearable. I love Hip Hop and this ain't it. He screams which is like fingernails on a chalkboard. If you buy this, you will be another notch on the belt of fools who are duped.
B00821OX98|5.0|I started this series just about 2 weeks ago give or take. Season 3 was already up to episode 5. I began on a Friday Night w/ the series premiere 2 hour episode, in less than a week I blew through S1, S2, & I caught up to S3 Ep.6! There isn't one boring episode nor are there any boring periods lasting more than TWO minutes, I am not exaggerating.  Very well cast, great acting, and very creative I think. I love that Tom Mason is/was a history professor. love the quotes, not to mention certain periods in Earth's/USA's history sometimes become useful in preparing tactics & war plans. The character (Pope) is a classic human antagonist in the show. Kind of reminiscent of &#34;Sawyer&#34; on &#34;LOST&#34;.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|it was good really fun I enjoyed it so go and get it you will like it I did so I know you will
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is a polished television production - even in it's fourth series, with many episodes per series, it retains interest. A large part of this is the well-drawn characters brought to life by superb acting, especially Julianna Margulies.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|Kristin Scott Thomas makes good choices when choosing parts worth something.  There is no one in the picture who is not living through something viscerally difficult and heartbreaking.  A story that leads from the deportation of Jews during World War II, the scattering of families, and a looming and glowering unknown future naturally leads to unwanted memories.  The inexpungible  survivor depression sends out tendrils of despair that touch everyone they come in contact with.<br /><br />And then there is the boorish husband who thinks he can overlook his wife's dilemma and make a life and death determination for both of them, that breaks her heart.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is great. I play it almost everyday. The down side is the sitting and waiting for income to upgrade units. Other then that it's a must download.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|For the Newman fan and fans of great movies...totally recommend! Great video and audio quality. Also this arrived on time as promised, enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game the rockets and fart guns and minions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />It is totally awesome<br />You have to buy it
0307951154|5.0|At least he hasn't disappointed me yet.  Harry Hole has a sullen misdemeanor--I like to think of it as \\"the Arctic charm,\\" as it is so noticeable in people of Scandinavian heritage--which actually covers a skewed sweetness he prefers to hide.  He's difficult, exasperating, single-minded, and unimpressed with most people except for those who are genuine.  He is gentle with the son of the woman he loves but cannot win.  He fights his alcohol addiction, sometimes better than other times, and he's careless about himself.<br /><br />Nesbo gives us a lot of dark mayhem and leads us in so many directions that just might be toward a solution, but he always surprises me.  His writing is tight, dense, full of characters who all have more problems than they are able, or care, to deal with.  All too often he takes us to places we really don't want to go, but he makes it worth our while.<br /><br />I'll read anything Nesbo.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|The movie wasn't horrible but it wasn't my favorite. I loved Nicholas Hoult but it wasn't one of his best work.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Quartet is Dustin Hoffman's first directing gig of a major film, and he's done something that's not easy - he's made what could be a depressing film about aging stars into a warm and engaging tale about the power of friendship and love. The story is set at a senior home for retired musicians and centers around an upcoming fund-raising concert at which all the residents perform. The main characters all have something of a history with each other. I think a good bit of the charm of this movie is the actors. Maggie Smith is, as always, incomparable. Pauline Collins (Shirley Valentine) is delightful as the one member of their little group who is having serious memory problems. Billy Connolly is perfect as the rude, rakish charmer who actually has a heart of gold. Tom Courtenay is the perfect gentleman who has a history with Maggie Smith's character.<br />It's a wonderful movie that I put in the &#34;Perfect for a Rainy Afternoon&#34; category. If you're a Maggie Smith fan, you won't want to miss it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love this game. I got it on my kindle fire to learn what it waz about and now im addicted.
B000LXQVA4|1.0|Upon opening package, I noticed that item was not in new condition.<br /><br />There were several scuffs, scratches and grime all over the product.<br /><br />I ordered a replacement item, I will update the higher star rating if problem is resolved.<br /><br />Amazon was the seller/shipper :(<br /><br />Now, we need to wait for a replacement, we were really hoping to see our baby jumping it today.
B00CWVGS10|5.0|I loved the books and the movie is just as great as the books! I suggest everyone to see it.
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|The Host is a story that relies on character development.  This film fails at every point.<br /><br />The scenario from the book is reasonably basic.  It proceeds as follows.<br /><br />Melanie gets caught, alien gets put in, alien tries to live her life (educator), Melanie interferes<br /><br />Plot shift<br /><br />something something spoilers alien gains acceptance within human group, something something emotional ending<br /><br />The movie robs the viewer of all character development, the alien's shift in perspective, Melanie's relationship with her alien invader, the humans who should have had some form of reason to like the alien are never given the opportunity to display why.<br /><br />It is aggravating,The Host is a good book one that deserved a good showing instead we got a movie that highlighted some events but not enough removed the when and why and gave us a drama in action movie format.  Everything was compressed to the point of no meaning.  Do yourself a favor get the book, don't even trifle with this garbage.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved it. Diary of a wimpy kid always makes me laugh. In my opinion I think this is the best one by far. Can't wait for the next one.
B005KJZDW6|5.0|When I heard this album was originally coming out, I had placed a pre-order for the CD.  When it finally arrived, I was a bit disappointed.  The vocals and instrumentals were fine but it just sounded &#34;dead and empty&#34;.  When I purchased a record player, I thought I would give this album another try.  I am so glad I did.  There is a richness that just can't be matched with record players.  Should had done this years ago!
B003VS0CXS|4.0|A very enjoyable family classic featuring Dick Van Dyke at his very best. Excellent quality transfer to blu-ray. It will make a great addition to any collection.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I want a clear picture of the weather not a busy collage of images. ugh. also ugly. bring beck last week's app.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|What more needs to be said.  It is Josh Groban.  Period.  He, his voice, his music---all AMAZING!!  His music grabs my soul!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I have heard all the hype about this book and finally caved in.  I loved the first book.  Super hot.  Lots of sex.  If your opinion of the first one was too much sex, not enough plot, you'll like the second one.  If your opinion of the first one was super hot, you'll wonder what happened to the author between Book 1 and Book 2.  In this book we start to learn all the backstory into Christian's life in a very choppy convoluted way.  After each shower or bath sex, we get 1-2 sentences about his childhood that can be summed up with the first 3 years he was poor and hungry.  If you attempt to keep up with the timeline you'll just be frustrated.  Kate leaves for Barbados.  They have a relationship.  Ana starts work for a week.  They break up.  A week later they get back together.  She gets a depo shot which takes 7 days to be effective.  It's been 5 weeks since they started dating.  Kate was gone for 16 days.  But at the end (approximately 5 weeks since they met?) he proposes and she says yes.  My favorite part of the book is when Jose says of course you do, look at this place, what's not to love?  LOL!!  Yep that's what the rest of us were thinking too.  This book just jumps all over the place, unsure of the direction it's trying to take.  Is it going to be sexy?  No.  Nothing kinky in this one until the very end.  Just the terms her whole body was nothing but sensation over and over.  Mindblowing explosion.  Nothing new on the sex front.  Personally, Anastasia is just a mess.  She spends 90% of this book talking about how she doesn't deserve Christian.  He is so hot, she's nothing.  Financially, we get nothing hot either.  They go out on his boat and go to several black tie events that are not described at all.  Ana is apparently bored of all the rich stuff now.  Unlike the first Charlie Tango flight, this time we get no descriptions of things.  As I said, Ana spends most of the time whining and becomes a lot less likeable.  Then of course Ana is at work as an intern.  Christian buys the company she works for and within a week fires her boss.  Ana gets the job as editor and somehow Christian talks her into believing he had nothing to do with that and it's just that she was such an amazing intern (despite coming in late, taking long lunches, and doing very little other than emailing Christian) that she should be made editor.  Yes she believes this.  Honestly?  We meet Christian's family which is nice.  I actually really like Mia and Ethan and Kate and Eliott and felt if we were going to spend so much time on \\"plot\\" this book, we should have followed those 2 couples.  Ana giggles pretty much non-stop, when she isn't whining.  She keeps on and on with the \\"I'm not sexually satisfying enough with vanilla sex\\" (though frankly between the whips, plugs, clamps, spanking, tying up, and shower scenes, I'm in complete disagreement as to vanilla) and  I'm still going to read the 3rd one, hoping it gets better.Christian buys the company she works for and within a week fires her boss.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I am addicted to this series. One of the best I have seen:) I will recommend this to my friends as well.
B00AEFYQE2|5.0|This was very well done -- funny and sweet, with top-quality performances from Kutcher, Portman, Cline, and Ludacris.  The dialog is smartly written.  Yes, it's got the same plot as all the other love stories, but you'll enjoy it more than once.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good way to pass time at school. I like how interactive it is but wish everything in the store wasn't so expensive.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is great. I expected a dumbed down version of the console version. This version is just as good.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics, fun puzzles, creative storyline. I am hoping for many more rooms to explore, a great beginning to a series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed trying to figure out each room.  l would recommend this if you like a challenge.<br />Level 10 was quite hard but very fun!
B004SIP8W0|5.0|An adorable story about how a special hilarious  man gives all he can to his family and helps them through the toughest times with love and laughter.
0525478817|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was such a romantic and cute story for teens. It may be 300 pages but its totally worth it and its a quick read because you get so into the book! Must read for all teen girls!
B005544V6A|5.0|I do like the series. It is really fun to watch. Even though I know it is not real but I still enjoyed it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app runs smoothly, there are vibrant colors and fun quests to fufill. This is a great app for anyone who plays it.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I purchased this for my Kindle Fire HD.  It is fun, but frustrating.  I actually like the version that came with my laptop better, but when on the go, this a great way to pass time.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|When I was first introduced to TED talks I thought, probably professors and such just trying to sell their books. Once I started to listen I was truly amazed  and inspired by the thoughtful, diverse presentations. These are not one hour lectures but 15-20 minutes of expressions of well thought out research and discovery by some truly amazing people.<br />I haven't watched &#34;regular&#34; TV in months.<br />Totally Hooked!
0425263924|4.0|these books have just gotten better can't wait for the next one this book you get to watch a love grow with a massive amount of secrets I'm left wondering can love survive secrets like that
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This is a great game to play for all ages. Me and my grandson play it alot, buying all kind of vegetables, bread, apples, milk, cheese, and alot more.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|So, the acting was good and overall done well.<br /><br />But it was so heartbreaking to watch her continually try to do things for her family with the hope of love for herself.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love this show and I wish there were more episodes every season. It is one of the off season shows that I really look forward to it starting back up.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Great music which I never attributed to his composition. I under-appreciated him until this album. I am a &#34;new&#34; fan.
B0072X2O66|2.0|I love the guys in the band, but it was kinda blues rock sorta. If you are into that style grag it ! I'm disappointed.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It's a good app that allows me to access my notes from multiple devices and with me and my laptop, iPad, Kindle and smartphone, that makes  it helpful!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love Adele and the softness she brings to her music.<br />I listen to her when I am looking for music that calms me and brings happy thoughts.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|Handy and easy to use. Writing as well as typing your notes.  App is vey helpful. Just what I've been looking for.
B000TFINY6|5.0|love this show.  Love it even more on blu ray.  Just as I remembered, but in H D.  Good product
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was super addictive! I love strategy games. However I did not like that there were only 10 levels I guess the new update will have more
B008M87GJK|5.0|Gives all the coverage of the news you could desire.  Covers the whole world -- well rounded reporting.  Great job!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a fresh take on the blurring of fantasy and reality, dreams and nightmares, and the polarity of events of childhood. It perfectly captures the tenuous spirit of childhood's logic, and imbues the reader with a sense of wonder that brings back the feeling of being a child, and the ability to believe that fairytales and legends are visceral and all around us, while simultaneously reminding us that it is SO easy to forget that childhood wonder. Going beyond that- it serves as a reminder of the inherent power of our feminine archetypes, and women in general. It is not your run-of-the-mill anything... I highly recommend it!
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits has a great storyline, acting, writing, and character development. I'm hooked! Monk and Psych are my other favorite shows, and Suits is right there with the best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so wonderful. I had many different emotions throughout the book. Everyone shoukd get a chance to read this!
B00063EMJ6|4.0|A good varied selection of Neil Young's respective hits. No complaints albeit there were only a half dozen songs that I was actually interested in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is great. I love the storyline. Love the gameplay. Love the MINIONS.Plus its free. Which makes it even better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly think subway surf owls very goo  because  there I  lots of different things to earn and you can save up to get awesome stuff like the dare devil sac yet e bored!!!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book is pretty good, the idea is original and the author writes very very well...but...the end is just crap. Well, for me it was. I really think the author just kind of got tired of the story and decided to end it, it could have been a 5 star book but he dropped from the climax to the end in a single chapter, and I just never felt that the book had an ending at all...
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is very difficult to win and I like the challenge to think several moves ahead. The first obvious move is not always the best move.
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|I like the game but I gave it only 3 stars. I would have given it 4 stars if level 3.7's tornados were fixed. The game was free so I can't complain to much but an update would be nice.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I gave it 4 stars since it is a good book...not spectacular, not mandatory reading...just good. I mean, it does give you a very detailed idea of what it is to be at war, right there in the fire line.. but I consider it a little bit repetitive in some parts, kind of monotonous. Anyway I have to accept that it is very well written, and as a matter of fact I would read again a book from Chris Kyle.<br />I would reccomend it to anyone interested in war/conflicts, biographies, and history since it will satisfy curiosities related to those subjects.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is awesome if you love card game cuz people you won't be sorry if you get just click download an give it a try thank you
B002ZB26AO|5.0|It is the best history book I have read about North Korea, it gives you all the date, historical accounts, and context that you need to fully understand the subject. It is very easy to read, I am actually reading it now for the second time...it is a very complete book in all senses.
159463176X|3.0|This book did not captivate me as the author's previous books, which I absolutely loved, did. I think the author may have been trying out some new kind of literary technique, which didn't grab me. Sometimes the story was related in the first person but other times it switched to a third person narrative as it jumped around in time without warning. The reader may be told of a person's death but later is taken back to the life of that person. New characters were introduced abruptly. Some of the stories/plots were gripping and poignant but alas their links to the main plot were weak or non-existent.<br />The author succeeded in showing how much the experiences of Afghans differed. It also depicted \\"the cruelty and boundless brutality of the world.\\" (153)
B00555X8OA|2.0|Read it if you like medicine or anything related to that...otherwise you will find it absolutely boring. I finished it just for respect to the author but it was a nightmare...I got bored so fast.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this allows people who don't have horses learn how to take care of them I really love this game it is fun and realistic unlike other games
B0097EWK3A|3.0|This one didn't seem to hold my interest. The graphics are great, but I found it a little tough to find the items using my Kindle. Could just be me getting older and needing glasses. LOL! Anyway, if you like hidden object games, you will probably enjoy this, if your eye sight is OK.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I use it with Sea Clear and it works great.  Has better hardware than the old BU that failed after two years.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love my Weather Channel app, and use it every day. It's so much easier than watching the Weather Channel itself, because I have my local weather right there at my fingertips any time I need it. I would recommend this app!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Simple game but a challenge to beat your score which becomes addictive to do.  To get the next upgrade on your car, then to beat your record and stunts is a relaxing rush.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|The game lagged and kept freezing, so I had no choice but to remove it from my device. There are many other games out there similar to this. Try those. You might get better results!
B0041D843M|5.0|Enjoying reading this and found that changing my diet was easier than I expected. An interesting record of Colin's life work.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I started playing Bubble Witch on FB and was so happy when it was finally released for Kindle. If you like Candy Crush, you'll enjoy Bubble Witch as well. I especially like how the game gets more challenging as you level up. It can get frustrating, but it can also be a good stress reliever. I would definitely recommend this game!
B003XRELGQ|4.0|I'm just getting into Vonnegut.  I love his satire and his dark sense of humor.  This book is sort of a metaphor for the way in which our technology has surpassed our ability to deal with it with our childish sense of morality.  And oh yeah, Vonnegut creates his own religion in this book.  :)
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best season opener! Better by far than the season 2 opener (which, at the time, was awesome!). This show just keeps getting better and better!!!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|You have to have quick moves inorder to keep the puck from getting by, and bouncing off walls and making the slot.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|This game definitely reminds me of cut the rope. Though in this game you're breaking crates instead of cutting ropes and putting Roby in a box instead of a candy in a mouth. The physics are also similiar. You break certain crates to cause the guy to go certain directions. Other than it is a simple and fun game play during your free time. If you love cut the rope which you should then get this game.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|So much of what we've grown up with as sci-fi has become reality and most of it began right here in the mid to late 60s. Those communicators and tricorders, the medical displays in Sickbay, space exploration and living in orbit, it started here. The Enterprise crew taught proper communicator etiquette, how to resolve issues with discussion and when to resort to a phaser.  Each episode dealt with a specific human situation from dealing with aliens to getting involved in other peoples business, love, hate, bigotry, war, having problems at every turn and even living in paradise. Whatever the situation Kirk, Spock and McCoy could find a logical or at least human solution and of course Scotty could fix the impossible in half the time of a regular mechanic. Makes a great gift for the sci-fi buff and, along with ST:TNG is outstanding for movie night.
0061969664|5.0|I have a difficult time walking away from any of Bernard Cornwell's books.  I only wish he could produce them faster.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is the best app ever it is just like subway surfer but better I think that you should get this app you will love it!!!!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My son is newly three years old and he loves playing this game...in fact so do I! its fun nd entertaining! I give it five stars!<br /><br />Kristin
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|I was enjoying the game. But, when I got to level 3.7, the game introduces a new Whirlwind Fan. However, they don't work like they're supposed to. The balloons crash into them instead of flying over and rotating 90 degrees. So, now I'm stuck without being able to play any other levels, until an update is released that fixes the glitch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I started playing this game on my grandsons iPod and was hooked instantly.  I had to go get it for my kindle.  Only playing the free one for now but will seriously think about purchasing it.  An awesome game for all ages!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the most greatest game that was invented me my cousin my uncle and my sister play this game most of the day. I personelly think that everyone should get this game above the age of 7.  I hope mojang makes this game free so we can add it on all our devices.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better.  As I saw on a picture. Keep calm and call Carson for tea!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely love it!!! So many people told me about it. I Wasn't aware of it when it ran originally so I was thrilled when I saw it available thru Amazon!
