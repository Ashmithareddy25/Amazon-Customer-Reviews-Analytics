B00821OX98|5.0|Excellent series just love the first season!I plan on buying this season the first chance I get and love Noah Wylie in it!
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|It's certainly up there with my favorites.<br />I've seen it four times and I know I'll see it again soon. 3D rendering is also great.
B005EHILV4|5.0|For the price and the size it's great.  Does so much really.  I am very glad I picked this thing up.  If you want to use an mic and plug it into a computer this is a great thing to have.  No problems recognizing drivers.  Just plug it in and things are ready to go.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Like most others free version initially launched, but upon exit and restart full version was running. Awesome metronome application and glad I downloaded it. Programmable rhythms, sounds, visuals. A keep<br />er!
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|Each album they put out is great.  This one has a different feel from others but still the same depth.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book by David Perlmutter, MD, a neurologist, builds a formidable case against gluten, the part of wheat which makes it so great for making all of the things we love to eat. Devastating! I love bread, cookies, pastry, gravy. Who doesn't?<br /><br />The book is disturbing because gluten is connected to so many medical problems, and the surprising thing is, some of these correlations have been known for a long time. If you are one who doubts the wisdom of eating low-carb, this book will change your mind.<br /><br />Dr. Atkins was vilified for advocating a low-carb diet. What will happen to Dr. Perlmutter? He is advocating a low-carb, high-fat diet.<br /><br />A must read for all who value their health, but especially for those of us with diabetes and memory problems.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I liked it.  Easy to read and makes you want to keep going.  Nothing more needs said because the book just grabs you.
B002OTO38K|4.0|I was assigned this movie to watch for a cultural competency class, and I'm so glad I watched it! The story was deeply moving, and the characterization of Bree's metamorphosis was portrayed with humor, sensitivity, and integrity.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|This game is addictive to me. It is a little harder to play on my Kindle, but I'll eventually get the hang of it I hope. I have had a stroke so I am a little slow at learning new things. Before my stroke I played it on the PC and loved it. Played it every chance I got. Thanks for the game.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Lots of fun, love game, so life like. 3d is awesome. Fun fun fun fun love hunting games. Yahoo Yahoo
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game me and my brother play it everywhere and everyday.and me and my brother are twins boy and girl so we do the same things .so you should really get this game and tell your twin to get it to ;)
B009ERK1T0|5.0|As a massive Deftones fan, this band has spoiled me like no other.  One listen to their newest album, and I am reminded why every other type of modern rock music I listen to is judged by chino and the boys, and no one measures up.  From beginning to end this is another winner, how they keep up the magic I will never know.  While most bands sputter and fall, they keep honing their sound, taking risks, and they almost always pay off. This gem is no exception!!<br /><br />Tempest is the biggest and boldest for me on this one, and clearly shows how far they have come as each an every album matures into something deeper and more mystical, without ever being hard to embrace.  I swear every time I listen to the song I feel as if I am waiting for some big mother ship to come pick me up in the middle of New York, spin me around, and take me apart from the inside out. Wicked song, wicked lyrics, wicked vocals!!<br /><br />Even more eclectic songs like Rosemary are easy to appreciate, even if may not have the hook that a lot of the other songs have that draw you in, but that is what makes so amazing, even when a song or two falters a little, it is 20 times better then most of the crap that is out there that passes for rock music.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor if you have not picked up the album, and treat yourself to it.  Whenever they come out with new stuff, i always support them and buy the record, no pirating with the deftones for me, they deserve every red cent they make for putting out such amazing music decade after decade!!!<br /><br />Another classic!!! I cannot wait to see what they do next!!!
B000I0XBNK|5.0|loved this movie, it was a really good one.  I really enjoy everything that Johnny Depp does.  Sorry it took so long for this feedback.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Different scenery. As like the others a good game. Why does the review need to have a required number of words?
1451668945|5.0|Haven't read it yet, but I know that I will love it.  Sorry you didn't get your feedback sooner, I left it on another page and for some reason it didn't show.  Sorry
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|I upgraded to the 5S last week, came home and ordered this case. I really liked the idea of minimal but still somewhat protective. So, I was shocked when I pulled the case out of the box and it was seriously and obviously USED! At first I thought I was crazy but when I held it up to the light, it not only was well scuffed on the clear plastic on the back but it had the etchings of random letters, like someone had used it as a solid object from which to scribble a note. I have never had such a bizarre purchase! Why even bother to put it in the box? Anyway, after seeing how scratched and worn the soft, clear plastic could get, I don't think I will be re-ordering from this manufacturer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun and frustrating at the same time trying to get three stars on some of the games!  I am enjoying the game though....
B00ACKU1NY|4.0|I chose this APP because I have forgotten a lot of my French vocabulary and it has become more and more difficult to understand spoken French, since I never hear it anymore. Hopefully this will help in both areas. I love the French language. I love Paris. I don't know why, I just do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone around me had been playing this game for awhile on iOS, I never really understood why they couldn't put it down... Now that it came to the Kindle Fire, I know why. It's a simple and straightforward game, but its hard to stop.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a wholesome story about people living the best they can even with their faults and the community they had in common.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for a long time for Amazon to get the app took you long enough to get with the program
030796664X|1.0|too much unnecessary dramatization,<br />low information density,<br />out of date and in accurate scientific information,<br />can not believe it has such high rating on amazon.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Great movie! Enjoyed this on a quiet Saturday morning. Glad times have changed and not like they were back then.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Bought this when Amazon had a super good deal on it. It's a great set and I am very pleased to have purchased it.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I don't watch many movies twice out stay awake during movies but this one was great.  Watched it the first time with my girls and second time with a friend.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is another fantastic Bond movie.  Daniel Crag is outstanding in the role of James Bond.  A must have for Bond enthusiasts.
0394818237|5.0|I don't think there are too many books with this type of detail and illustrations.<br />It's really amazing and a great book to have in your libary!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|While the Khan theme is revisited, it is done so in a creative and compelling way.  This movie is a keeper.
B00BV85ATQ|1.0|Ok, let's get out of the way first of all that this is a great recording as are most of Gould's. Grab it - on previous releases. The reason for one star is the \\"24k gold\\". There is maybe 5 cents' worth of gold used on the plating and it makes absolutely no difference in the reflective quality of the surface which is what a CD player uses to make what becomes digital sound. This ploy was tried back in the 80s and gave people who had money but no intelligence something about which to brag. Artistically, technologically, and musically the gold doesn't make one it of difference. Now, Sony may have tinkered with the remastering to increase highs or bass but that has nothing to do with charging an extra $45 for a trivial amount of gold. Don't be a sucker. I'm amazed at a company like Sony that I thought had integrity for trying this.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|What a well made concert blu ray!  Maybe the sales of this will re-vitalize rock and roll's new generation.  Great video, sound is awesome, 30 songs, what more you want?  I was a bit concerned about the sound after seeing the concert at the movie theater which didn't do justice to the sound performance of the live show, but I'm relieved to know it was the theater and not the sound track, because it sounds awesome on my home theater system.  The bass is full enough to rattle pictures on the wall.  One of the best rock concerts I've ever seen!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I could not put the book down, the author is very descriptive and detailed and paints a very clear picture.  Beyond brave, every American should read this story.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I am naturally Leery of \\"new\\" discoveries. For a year I have been on a very low carb diet similar to what is recommended by Dr. Perlmutter and for me it has been good. The discussion about systemic inflammation seems to be reasonable. I remain somewhat skeptical about the use of the recommended supplements. One thing I find encouraging is that the author does not try to \\"sale\\" me a line of products, that is an instant turn off for me. My wife are going to slightly modify our current routine to meet meet Dr. Perlmutter's recommendations.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Great book untill you get close to the end. Not his best of the Lincoln layer series. Very frustrating ending.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I felt like a ten-year-old reading Robinson Crusoe. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />A beautiful adventure and cultural / historical education.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Have played it on Facebook for quite a while and now I can finally play it on my Kindle Fire!  About time!  I bought the book by mistake because I was so excited to see the Candy Crush Saga logo that clicked on the One-Click without reading the description and boy............ was I disappointed!  But, being able to get it free was a real thrill! Thanks Amazon for coming through.
006202406X|1.0|wish someone had told me not to read this. there are lots more reviews on amazon.com that are worth reading...<br /><br />very poor character development. you never have any idea who is speaking except for the chapter title. the ending has no resolution or point... there is no plot to the book.... even three quarters of the way through I didn't know what the point of the book was, they were not working towards anything and then a bunch of twist ending things happened that had no point to them. also, they had no real romance to their relationship and like that was blamed on the tense situations they keep getting themselves into and then they can't decide to sleep together or not... Four's personality seemed to be much more random here than in the other books, like he became a child again. its really clear she had never written in two POV before and it was poorly developed... way too many new characters was added and this book didn't need to be 526 pages. what a waste of time.<br />I am NOT reading any more trilogies or dystopian fiction for a long time. the disappointment with this series runs deep and there just isn't enough purpose to the things thrown into the book to care.
B00C5R8364|3.0|I had high hopes for this book as I loved so many of FF's past novels.  This one was suspenseful but it just seemed like he could have gotten to the point/solved the mystery much faster. It was kind of fluffy and I whipped through it.<br /><br />Also he hopped back and forth a lot as he wove story pieces together.  At first, it was confusing but you eventually adjust to the abrupt changes and the story does come to a satisfying conclusion.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Maybe this isn't quite up to The Fourth Protocol, The Dogs of War, The Fist of God or his other masterpieces. (Okay, let's also mention The Day of the Jackal, the one that started it all.) But, The Kill List is one of his best recent works. He takes us inside the top secret world of the western alliance. What I like best about Freddie's work is that it's always about honorable men taking on truly bad guys and doing whatever it takes to get rid of them. Too often we take such men for granted and when we do that, we lapse into indifference and then begin to question why they should be there in the first place. Forsyth reminds us that they serve a real purpose and that we should be grateful for what they do. The only other modern day author who could do that as well was Vince Flynn, who left us way too soon earlier this year because of cancer. Forsyth is still carrying the torch and doing it better than anyone else.
B00DE76PM8|5.0|I like this app, doesn't need a internet connection. I use it on my tablet and when we travel it comes in handy. Very nice app, delivers everything as promised.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the sounds and the effects when a big stack comes out... This is a good game to waste time with.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun fun fun starts easy and gets harder! Go at your own pace and makes you think a good tool for your brain!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|the number one sanity-preserver in my life. every  document is accessible through custom filters. better than a notebook and pen
B005LAII3A|4.0|Thought it was good but must admit, I liked the original better. Kate Benckinsale was great! Colin Farrell was good to. Would recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not to difficult but waiting on up dates stink. I have had this for almost a year and no up dates yet.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Thought it was great. Kept me interested all the way. Definitley would recommend it. Would make a good series for TV or even another Star Trek sequal (s).
B008GWOVB8|5.0|I have always been a fan of this movie and am happy to finally own a copy. I love the music and even though I've seen it many times I always enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever! I play all the time great game for kids and kids at heart! !only would be better if you didn't run out of lives
B000HF6XV8|4.0|The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because I loved the music from it, so I viewed it through Amazon Prime.  I especially was impressed with the special effects with the animals, and just the overall sense of fairy-tale quality to it.  The movie was predictable and some of the acting not especially brilliant, but still, I was glued to the screen, and thoroughly enjoyed it, with tears welling up at the end.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to load, no problems. Glad to have my Kindle books on my new device. Thanks Amazon for another great transaction!

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|A very good app and fun to play. It is alot like the arcade game. Lb go pic full oz an ox duck Idk laden lift lb chi Wendy the best way for you have to tell me that the time of day it was u boo grew by macklemore so I can't go to bed night and I think the
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite books and I just love the whole love story, the fact that someone can love you even though you have cancer or some other disease, is truly beautiful. Please, read this book
B005LHO274|4.0|In the dos days of computers, I used a program called Skyglobe. It was a simple program that showed what was happening in the sky now or at a time of my choosing. No pretty pictures, just good info.  This app is on the same line, but much more elaborate, with tons of info. Skyglobe on steriods.  Worth every penny I paid. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 only because I use it on a kindle hd, which does not let me use some of the features because of the kindle's limitations - no gps or compass capability. Otherwise it would get 5.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I think that this is a great game. EXCEPT, when you try to log into Facebook on it it doesn't work but other than that. AMAZING game!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was good and I read it in less then a day but it kind of left a lot of questions...
0345803493|4.0|Book two was more  of the same.<br />I gave it an &#34;I liked it&#34;  because it was good reading if you just liked the sex.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I really like this game and it plays well with no crashes but updates for hovercraft and beach levels don't show up on kindle fire so I'm a little hummed. otherwise good game.
0345803507|5.0|I gave it  five stars because it had some suspense.<br />I got a hint in book two but forgot and was reminded in a suspenseful way.<br />It ended well with &#34;Shades&#34; accepting his position as a father and husband.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I know what all the &#34;talk&#34; is about. It seems most people are playing this game and now I know why. It is fun and addictive and a great way to pass time. Children of all ages can play. (Of course this includes adults.)
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I play it all the time.  It works flawlessly and is increadibly fun.  So far the best game for my Kindle Fire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive!! Favorite way to kill time and entertain my kids all at once.  Truly a guilty pleasure.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Fantastic movie... would highly recommend watching!!!! Action-packed from beginning to end.... good story line, overall five stars!!! Definitely I would watch again!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is great.  I was always curious and now know why.  Takes you back in time and the costumes are amazing during that time period.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A fun game that is challenging.  I can understand why so many people are hooked.  I give it a high five.<br />Need to play it a while to plot a winning strategy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing game must buy it now its fun I love it's the game to buy now get it and its free
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's not something I'd watch over and over, but it's good fun and entertaining.
0062017926|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  It was the type of book you didn't want to put down. another fine book by James Rollins.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I've just finished the Epilogue That Would Not End. I'm disappointed not just at the ending but by the whole book. I had issues with the first two books (not the least of which is that in Chicago it's Madison STREET not Madison AVENUE) but I thought they were interesting and different. They introduced me to a world I hadn't known. I would recommend them to other readers. I wondered how the author was going to tie everything up. Poorly, as it turned out. Spending 10 hours in limbo at O'Hare Airport is no more fun in the literary world than it is in the real world. I want some of that memory serum. I want a reset - to before I wasted time reading this book. I will be returning it.<br /><br />Oh, and Four? Before you wander off into the sunset with Christina, remember what happened to the last 3 guys she was friendly with.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it, so glad I can play it on my kindle, my daughters and husband like to play too. Great game
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wow. This a great sci-fi book. I mean, sometimes it's a little misleading, but hey, what book doesn't have any boring parts? One thing I still don't get is this: what in the world is a bugger? It's not like we get a description of what a bugger is! Also, what is a third? Because this book doesn't have a glossary! Anyway, the movie comes out on (I think this is true!) November 1. I give Ender's Game a double thumbs up!!!
B00F52YOPA|5.0|I enjoyed this game and can't wait for the next one. I like the price and hope I can find more games like this one to purchase at the lower price.
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|I love this true story!  It's tragic and beautiful at the same time.  The way the development of mental illness is portrayed is spot on.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This book describes and absolutely terrifying incident of an explosion at a Titan II missile site called the Damascus Incident and weaves historical perspective of nuclear weapons safety and arms control throughout as it tells the story of the disaster.  Very well written, although somewhat dry at points.  Schlosser seems to have a little bias against nuclear weapons and deterrence, which is, in my opinion, justified.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a really cool game, very lifelike, and the graffics are so real too. I highly rate this one, good job folks.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The beginning of the book started off great and took you right back to The Shining but fizzled after that.  Not the goose flesh result that I got on reading the earlier novel.  Actually as the book progressed it reminded me more of The Stand, which I throughly enjoyed.  Maybe I just expected too much.
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|I loved this game on my kindle fire until I hit the last level of a royal rescue....the app closes itself  and will not let me continue. Disappointed.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I am finding this book interesting but difficult.  It is well written definitely.  But I have may doubts if I can complete the whole thing.  It is to long!  I admire Steve Jobs but hate how he treated people around him.
0345803485|1.0|I'm a writer but not a snob. My favorite books are breezy fiction, but well-written. I didn't care for Twilight but read it and didn't hate it. That being said, this book made me so very sad. This is what passes for literature now?? Where are our standards?? The vocabulary is pitiful, supplemented by a couple of poorly chosen entries from a thesaurus. The main character is a blubbering idiot (I don't claim to be super articulate and graceful when I fall in love, but come on). The plot takes a back seat to the sex scenes (to the delight of several readers, I'm sure), but the sex scenes suffer from amateurish repetition. Much like with actual sex, this dulls the experience. I didn't read it searching for things to hate, like some of the critics who dove into the second and third installments with a red pen in hand, but by the end I've cultivated a rich, seething contempt for this trilogy, and I couldnt even get past book one. It's insulting to good writing that this has become so successful. An editor should have worked with Ms. James until this was ready for the shelves. I'm sure with some hard work, this could pass for a decent beach read. As it is, it's laziness.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Downloaded app for free (freebie of the day.  A little tricky to set up the first time, but worked very well over Wi-Fi to transfer pictures
B0034G4P94|5.0|Warrior is a touching story that shows the ultimate love between two brothers & is a must see for all! Pulls at your heartstrings throughout, also showing the struggles of a father, who seeks forgivness from his sons.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILER*****************************************************************  I asked my ten year old son why he thought an author would kill the main character at the end of a series and he said, \\"to be fascinating,\\" that pretty much sums it up. In an attempt to be different to be dramatic the author has \\"gone outside the box\\" and ruined a beloved book for thousands of readers. Another author defended her decision stating that a writer \\"owes\\" their fans nothing. A writer can write whatever they want whether we like it or not. This of course is true, HOWEVER, if you want people to read your book and not feel jerked around then you do owe them something. A writer needs to take care with others emotions, to take them on a ride yes, but to purposely jerk them around in order to be fascinating or dramatic is quite another thing. It's a lot harder to be original and fascinating than it is to kill someone off.  We as fans also \\"owe\\" nothing to the writer and she has seen that in people vowing to never again go on her roller coaster to only be thrown off in the end. As a writer if you truly do not care about your readers then why publish? Write your book that owes nothing to nobody and put it on a shelf to be viewed only by you in your leisure time. This writer is very young and her choices reveal that. I think she is finding her fans can be dramatic and fascinating as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so fun and whenever I'm board and easy to just and play mostly because I love infinite run games
B0081336FO|5.0|I enjoyed season 1, season 2 is just as good.  When the first episode of season 1 I thought &#34;No way&#34;.  But it works & love the characters!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever!!!  Absolutely hooked on this game and was so excited to see that now I can play on my Kindle Fire.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it's great! I love this game it is so  additionally it makes you want to play it every  day. I love it
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The book is very interesting and reads like a novel.  It presents many aspects of the Bible in a new light and is well researched and documented.  I would recommend it to anyone with a questioning mind who is curious about the beginnings of Christianity.  I found the authors idea of the important of James very enlightening.  I just plain liked the book and will reread it again and probably get twice as much out of it. Twila Compton
B00F56AZK4|5.0|best game ever<br />my favorite puzzle part is Japanese gardens<br />and a best part is do photos as puzzles<br /><br />I LOVE PUZZLES AND THAT GAME
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome! From the time I started reading, I couldn't stop! Danger at every turn in the Game and then the ending! My heart was pounding so hard, eyes wide open, screaming inside my head and out of my mouth! Wow, this book was one of the best I've ever read. Thank you Suzanne Collins for this great book and series. I can't wait for the movie in November!
B00ANA27IU|3.0|The enticing words drew me into the pages of this book. The characters were believable and the story line promised excitement. I reached the denouement and I expected emotions to explode into a finale. Instead a got a fizzled balloon. What a let down.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I Love playing his game. It works well on my kindle and the graphics are awesome. I wish you could use the gyro to aim instead of your finger.
B002N44XSG|1.0|Worst book of the series that I've seen. Absolutely no story to it. Skip this and don't waste your time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very entertaining and gives you some way to distract ur self.Stress release and very cute..Luv it. Thanks Candy Saga .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My family recommended this knowing my game preferences, and their recommendation was spot on.  This game is more fun than a plain Bejewelled type of game because of the situations you have to puzzle out, and I love puzzles.
B000ICXQU6|5.0|Julia Roberts is GREAT!. So is Albert Finney. Must see over and over and over and over and over and over and over an over.
0143124544|4.0|It was a good book to read on my commute on the bus.  Engaging, though not so much as to miss my stop.

B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is a must see for any family who loves Italian history as presented by Hollywood. We loved it so much we went and picked up grandma from the home so she could relive her childhood with us.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|A real classic old series. And this new box set is cheap enough to make importing to the UKna possibility. Highly recommended.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love it so far.  Been playing for a few months now and havnt gotten bored,and that's saying a lot!  Would recommend to anyone who loves search puzzles. if you use strategy, you could totally ROCK this game without spending any money!  I am pretty far up there in the levels and I am still enjoying it almost every day! played similar games, but this one is by far superior in graphics and game play.:)
B0011UJMK2|5.0|A perfect political thriller & police procedural roles into one!  I don't normally read or enjoy fiction but this work was the perfect blend of history, suspense, and politics.  Perhaps the greatest indictment of Soviet Communism.
B0065CCM76|5.0|anything by Bob Seger is sure to be good.  When it is all of the biggest hits, you can't go wrong.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Recommended this to others.  It is well written with good character development.  I enjoyed read and I was a little sorry to end it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|this charger fits very tightly in the car power jack and doesn't wobble like others I've tried in the past. This makes sure the thing doesn't unplug when driving through a bumpy road.

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|We saw this at the theater and about 5 minutes in, I knew I would be purchashing it.  Just received it yesterday and will be watching it as we get closer to Halloween.  Not too many movies scare me, becase I think alot of them are to cheesy and fake, but this one was the real deal.  Several scenes made the little hairs on the back of my neck stand up and if a film can do that to me, I know it's a good one!  Don't miss it and remember to lock the doors tight!!!
B003PIS5XI|5.0|Classic cheesy sci-fi fun. I was a kid when this first came out and I loved it then, so I may be a bit biased. LoL. But the quality of this movie was impressive for something that was originally sold on VHS tape. It's still a little grainy (you can't get blood from a stone) but the colors and brightness were definitely enhanced. Quality looked better than my memories of it, and that says a lot.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|This metronome app has many configurations for building complex rhythms, while making it easy to do so. You set (or tap) the beats per minute and the number of beats per measure. For each beat, you can choose from a list of 22 different rhythm patterns, allowing you to create the perfect rhythm in seconds.  It also has save slots for you to save the rhythms that you've built. This has instantly replaced my regular metronome for practicing.  If you are a musician, get this app!<br />Also, in reference to some of the earlier reviews, I got the full version the first time.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|One of the all time greats. This movie is timeless. A masterpiece. Don't be misled by the modern cheesy re-makes... this is the one to buy.

The problem wasn't the central premise; it was an ambitious office worker performs dubious favours in exchange for career advancement, but the actual treatment of it. In the hands of writer-director Billy Wilder and his collaborator I. A. L. Diamond, `The Apartment' became a razor-sharp farce that equated corporate success with immorality. Actually, filmmakers in communist Russia viewed it as an indictment against capitalism. The central character Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter, is actually little more than a pimp for upper management while the girl of his dreams, elevator-operator Fran Kubelik [Shirley MacLaine], is a demoralised working girl whose solution to a failed love affair is to commit suicide. These are not the most wholesome characters in the world and we're talking about the hero and heroine! However, as played by Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, Bud and Fran not only win the audience's sympathy but also charm them in the process. The most astonishing thing about The Apartment is how Billy Wilder manages to keep the tone light and playful while exposing the worst aspects of Manhattan corporate life, from the drunken office parties to the casual adultery committed by married employees. Despite these controversial elements, the film racked up ten Oscar nominations and won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director of 1960.<br /><br />`The Apartment' marked the first time Shirley MacLaine had worked with Billy Wilder and she quickly discovered that her habit of occasionally improvising or changing dialogue was not welcome. For example, she delivered a wonderful take of a scene set in the company elevator but it had to be re-shot when Wilder discovered she had omitted one word of dialogue. Still, Billy Wilder was sufficiently impressed with her acting to cast her in the lead role of ‘Irma la Douce' [1963]. `The Apartment' also won Shirley MacLaine her second Oscar nomination as Best Actress (the first time was for `Some Came Running' in 1958).<br /><br />Getting ahead in life can be rather difficult. With the business world seemingly rigged, many desperate individuals will try just about anything to catch a break or find a leg up, leading to some pretty creative strategies. The protagonist of Billy Wilder's 'The Apartment,' is one such desperate, but crafty individual, and in order to climb the professional ladder he resorts to some decidedly out-of-the-box thinking. A masterful blend of comedy and pathos, the film presents a charming, entertaining tale of romance that isn't afraid to tread into some surprisingly dark subject matter. Led by Jack Lemmon's effortless, everyman charisma, and Shirley MacLaine's heart-breaking allure, the film easily stands the test of time, putting most, similar modern efforts to shame.<br /><br />Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter [Jack Lemmon] is a low level employee at a big insurance company who dreams of rising to the top of the corporate world. In order to make his ambitions a reality, he has devised a devious little scheme to win over the good graces of his superiors, by letting his bosses use his apartment for their various adulterous affairs. The plan works like a charm, and soon Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter [Jack Lemmon] is invited to meet with the company's head honcho, Jeff D. Sheldrake [Fred MacMurray]. It turns out Sheldrake wants to utilise Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter's unique services as well, and not wanting to pass up the potential for a big promotion, he seizes the opportunity. Unfortunately, the situation takes a dramatic turn when Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter discovers that Jeff D. Sheldrake's romantic partner is none other than the building's lovable elevator attendant, Fran Kubelik [Shirley MacLaine]. After he develops feelings for Ms. Fran Kubelik, and then Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter begins to rethink his strategies, and must ultimately choose between business and love.<br /><br />The true genius of the film revolves around its perfect mixture of comedy and drama. The main plot features a delightfully subversive sense of humour that presents a cynical satire on corporate America. Highly influenced by the great Ernst Lubitsch, Wilder gives his characters playful, unique personalities and biting, memorable lines of dialogue. In sharp contrast to many modern comedies, the humour is given time to develop and breath, with Wilder often lingering on shots, letting Jack Lemmon draw out and build extra bits of amusement. While all of the comedy works brilliantly throughout, the movie actually takes a very dark turn at its half way point, and somehow Wilder is able to balance the tones without skippinga beat. In fact, not only does the drama not end up clashing with the comedy, it actually turns out to be incredibly effective and powerful. A certain downtrodden malaise casts over the second half, showering the proceedings in a sobering mist that draws some very realistic characterisations while still maintaining an ultimately life affirming charm. It's a truly remarkable juggling act, and Billy Wilder makes it all seem so easy.<br /><br />One particular scene becomes a great example of the film's oscillating, but perfectly harmonious tones. At an office Christmas party, Ms. Fran Kubelik is given some bad news about her precarious relationship with Jeff D. Sheldrake. Depressed and sombre, she runs into Baxter who enthusiastically shows her his brand new office. Baxter carries on, trying on a silly hat with a playful smile while acting like a giddy fool. All the while, Fran Kubelik continues to wallow in sadness on the complete opposite end of the emotional spectrum. The manner in which the dialogue and interactions are written and performed almost makes it seem like the characters are in two completely different films. Jack Lemmon appears to be in a light-hearted comedy and Shirley MacLaine is clearly in a drama, but somehow they come together, and it works beautifully.<br /><br />In the included special features, it's revealed that the director feared Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter might prove unlikeable to audiences, but honestly I'm not really sure what Billy Wilder was worried about. It's nearly impossible for Jack Lemmon to seem unlikeable, and as Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter the actor absolutely wins over viewers. The character is a classic lovable loser, a lonely &#34;schnook&#34; with a good heart that makes some poor decisions. Jack Lemmon plays up all the right comedic and dramatic beats, and demonstrates a great talent for physical comedy. As memorable as the actor is, Shirley MacLaine might actually be the real scene stealer. Her performance as Fran Kubelik is irresistible and touching. Her sadness is palpable, and Shirley MacLaine underplays the emotions with heart-breaking restraint, revealing devastating bits of anger and sorrow through simple glances and fleeting lines of dialogue. The pair has incredible chemistry and make for one of cinemas most lovable on screen couples.<br /><br />Billy Wilder injects a surprisingly strong visual style into the proceedings. Opting for a very wide 2.35:1 [Panavision] aspect ratio, the director often uses the full scope of the frame. Character placement and blocking take advantage of the added space, enhancing bits of drama and comedy. There is a great economy of shots on display as well, with the director choosing to cut to new angles only when functionally necessary or dramatically important. Many scenes feature relatively long takes with wide masters. The film is home to stark, noir influenced lighting, which helps to set it apart from typical comedies, bolstering the narrative's unique blend of tones. Production design is also top notch, with some inventive forced perspective set construction used to exaggerate the business world's dehumanizing grip. In addition, the apartment itself takes on a life of its own, becoming a cosy retreat from the movie's harsh corporate environment.<br /><br />'The Apartment' is a true classic, a perfectly balanced masterpiece that celebrates love's joys and heartaches with wit and insight. The film has inspired many imitators and has become the prototypical romantic dramedy that all subsequent releases aspire to be. Truly ahead of its time, the movie actually feels fresher today than the majority of its numerous modern copycats. Through the story of lonely Calvin Clifford (C.C.) &#34;Bud&#34; Baxter, Billy Wilder tells the tale of a simple &#34;schnook&#34; who learns how to be a real &#34;mensch,&#34; illuminating all of the cynical and heart-warming realities of life along the way.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – The film is provided with a stunning and beautiful black-and-white 1080p encoded image transfer in the 2.35:1 [Panavision] aspect ratio. Authentic to the filmmakers' intentions, this is a wonderful, nicely preserved transfer. The print is in fantastic shape, but there are some very minor specks here and there, mostly in the opening shots. A light layer of grain is visible throughout giving the image a pleasing, natural filmic quality. Clarity is good, revealing all of the little, painstaking production details. Wilder utilizes the widescreen frame to its full advantage, and the transfer does a nice job of showcasing his understated, economical, but still artful compositions with nice instances of depth. With that said, wide shots do look a tad soft. Contrast is nice and high, featuring bright whites that pop and deep, inky blacks that really show off the film's noir influenced lighting design. Some very mild edge enhancement pops up in a few scenes, but doesn't hurt the presentation. 'The Apartment' shines nicely on Blu-ray in a faithful, consistent transfer. With very little signs of damage or age, the image carries a clean, mostly pristine look throughout that should more than please fans.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The film is provided with an English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track along with Spanish and French mono tracks. Subtitle option includes English SDH. Resisting the urge to spruce up the original mono elements too much, this is a respectful remix that does the film justice. Dialogue is clear and full throughout with no signs of crackle or hiss. The soundstage remains faithful to the movie's mono roots but has been opened up slightly in subtle but effective ways. Speech and other effects are occasionally spread out directionally when appropriate, and soft echoes of music and ambient sounds hit the rear speakers. The wonderful score comes through with nice fidelity demonstrating pleasing range with no distortion. Low end activity is minimal, but for a movie of this type that is to be expected. Balance between all of the audio elements is handled well. While I usually prefer for mono films to retain their original track, this 5.1 remix is so subtle and unobtrusive that I didn't mind it at all. With no major signs of age or distortion, this is a very solid track.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary with Film Historian Bruce Block: Bruce Block provides an informative and steady discussion of the movie, rife with production trivia and facts. Various details on the film's locations, casting, schedule, production design, and visual style are all touched upon. Bruce Block also describes several scenes that were cut from the final edit and even reads a few excerpts from the original script, demonstrating how close the finished product stays to the writers' detailed descriptions. Some background information on Billy Wilder is thrown in, including talk about his love for Ernst Lubitsch films and their heavy influence on his work. Though Block does repeat himself a bit throughout, this is a pretty strong commentary that fans should definitely check out.<br /><br />Special Feature: Inside The Apartment [1960] [30:00] This is an interesting look back at the film's production, featuring interviews with some of the cast and crew. Billy Wilder's path to Hollywood is discussed along with details on the inspirations for the films risqu&eacute; subject matter. Participants touch upon the film's innovative mixture of tones and share various anecdotes from the set.<br /><br />Special Feature: Magic Time: The Art of Jack Lemmon [1960] [13:00] Here the focus is on actor Jack Lemmon. Interviews with his son, who looks and sounds a lot like him and biographer, are included, sharing lots of details on his life and approach to acting.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer [1960] [1080p] [2:00] The Original Theatrical Trailer is included.<br /><br />Finally, 'The Apartment' is a genuine masterpiece, a rare film that perfectly marries humour and drama into a beautifully insightful and entertaining package. By blending sombre pathos, biting satire, and light-hearted charm, Billy Wilder ends up with a truly unique piece of cinema that was way ahead of its time. The video transfer is strong, remaining faithful to the filmmaker's intentions, and though it's a mostly unnecessary remix, the new 5.1 track does the movie justice. The special features aren't exactly mind blowing, but the commentary and documentary are a very welcomed inclusion. Basically, this is a stunning wonderful Blu-ray disc for a really special beautiful classic Billy Wilder film, who is one my all-time favourite Directors, who has never made a duff film in my opinion and is so sad this wonderful person is not around anymore to make more brilliant films, as Billy Wilder scripts are so poignant and character drive and it is so wonderful to add this to my ever increasing Billy Wilder Blu-ray Collection.

B000I9YX06|5.0|My family likes Will Smith. We decided to watch \\"irobot\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it. There is some language by fellow actor Shia LaBeouf, which was totally unnecessary.
B00FR3QVW6|5.0|Another great work by the amazing Ben Cooper! The Branches is more refined and complex than the previous albums. This is definitely my favorite so far. I highly recommend purchasing!
020530902X|5.0|This book is a helpful addition to have around when writing.  I strongly encourage anyone contemplating purchasing it to do so.
B00005OBR8|5.0|Having just come back from a great concert at the Festival Hall London with this piece by the Sao Paulo Orchestra on tour under Marin Alsop with the latest grouping of the redoubtable Swingle Singers, I returned - yet again, I am a child of the Sixties being aged 9 to 18 through that decade - anyway, to this very special disc in the original ERATO release, I must say thank you Mr Boulez, as on the record, and all the other reviewers who mainly think this is a top ten recording. The playfulness, rage and protest (yes it occupies a special boiling point in that decade in the aftermath of the Paris student riotswhere it was composed) but sheer toppsy turvey chic and flair of those years is all there. &#34;Keep going going&#34;...yes, to the thousands in Brazil and elsewhere round the world who were to be hunted down and murdered by the henchman in various fascist regimes and military dictatorships round the world sponsored by the USA. It's a fun piece, but the underlying meaning is deadly subversive and triumphant! Or is it a reminder that those dark days have never gone away?<br /><br />I think this performance is there, centred in the heart of the music. I can imagine more driven performances, but I really love clarity and focus. So this is great. Also authentic...given the performers.<br /><br />The sound on this disc is absolutely fabulous. Each voice and instrument is accurately pinpointed - more than one can say in the dreadful acoustic of the Festival Hall (and I was in a £50 seat). For an early digital disc some miracle happened (was it IRCAM or God?) which defies explanation, especially when you consider some of the stinkers turned out by Erato and Radio France over the years.<br /><br />The Sinfonia was dedicated to marvelous Leonard Bernstein, a very representative figure of the 1960s, and his student, Marin Alsop gave London a great performance worthy of the composer and him coupling it with Lenny's Symphonic Dances from West Side Story. But it was the Berio that stole the show!<br /><br />GET IT, GET, GET IT!  PLEASE.
B0016O6ZHQ|5.0|The first time that I heard this album I fell into it almost as I would into a good book. The narrative is complex, but clear. The characters are well developed, and the story is peppered with dark, mythic literary allusions. His take on the Odyssey is particularly striking. And his depiction of Lazarus, as the character Larry, was fascinating. It raised the question: If you were dead, would you want to come back?

B00BD99JMW|1.0|If I had read this book from the library instead of spending money on it, I would only be mildly annoyed about the time I wasted when the only part that mattered was the end<br />. This book was just lame. It was repetitive even in the use of \\"light was winking\\" when talking about sunlight, but winking is such a weird word choice you would think it would be used minimally.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is a beta product and it shows.  I went through the initial setup and used this several times.  The next weekend my android failed to connect but my daughter's iPhone connected.  Next weekend I tried again, and it still failed to connect. I did the reset dance - updated android chromecast app, restarted chromecast, rebooted router...., and it didn't help.  Phone tech tells me to reset to factory defaults but I refuse to have a product that requires me to reset to factory default every weekend.  I am returning the product and getting my peace of mind back.  Life is too short to hassle with poor quality products.
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|Played several games on it but not really satisfied with the explaination of the games before trying them.  Very little instruction provided.  It might work for those who are intuitive about these sorts of apps.  but I was not happy with it.  This app does have a lot of variety though and that brings it to two stars for me.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Fast paced with lots of fun power up effects.  Demands a fairly powerful tablet for the framerate to not get hitchy, but otherwise much improved over its predecessor.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I use this app all the time.  It is challenging and sharable.  When out with friends we can all take turns trying to feed the adorable Om-<br />Nom.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Level 380 and still playing. Very addictive game. I just wish I don't have to wait for ticket to get to next zone!
B008JFLWLE|4.0|You can write with your finger to work figures.  Able to work higher functions.  I will be keeping this one.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|The best Harry Nilsson box set you could ever ask for!! Great sound and great extras!! This contains probably everything Harry ever recorded. Well worth the price and then some!!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|At first i really liked this game then i got so bored with it and i was only up to level 20.  I don't think it's all that everyone has been raving about, too bad.  Original post: Love the mindless challenge, keeps me busy in between meetings.  I don't mind the lives thing because they are all refilled by the time I am free to play
B000IEXVCC|3.0|Only watch if you have patence for an &#34;artistic&#34; movie, if it is something lighthearted you are after, sick this option
B00CWY76CC|4.0|As with all free apps this is just a short piece of what could be, and probably is, a much longer paid game. But what's here is good. The game isn't impossibly hard, nor easy. It's just requires patience and a little logic.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is my favorite game. You can do many things and I dragons look so cool! I most certainly recommend this game especially to those of you who like dragons!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't wait to get more lives to play! There should not be a limit on lives.use yours<br />lives.end of game start new!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great option for younger lovers of video games I'd say anyone ten or younger would be entertained by this version of the game. I got this to stop bickering between my boys over who got the x-box to play mine craft. It gave my eight yr old an easier way to learn about the game while freeing up a computer and the x-box for other use.  His part of this review was to say this was a fun game and give me the kindle so I can play it please......are you done?? This is definitely one of his favorite games from the app store.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I always liked this show due to its likable characters and well though out antagonists that reappear throughout the seasons...Too bad stargate universe did not work on this principal...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a beautiful creation. The graphics are gorgeous, the sounds are creepy( I literally had to lower the volume to make sure some of these noises I was hearing was actually the game and not some creepy thing that I unlocked and was in the room with me) and the difficulty level was just right. It was challenging but not so much that you get frustrated and want to throw your kindle to the wall. I've played other problem solving puzzles before some so hard I deleted them and some so easy they were a joke. This one is just right!  I<br /> started this game at 5pm played until about midnight reluctantly put it up to get some shuteye( little more than halfway thru) woke up around 4am because in my dream I figured out where to put a gear and played till I finished. My only con to this game is it wasn't long enough I wanted it to just continue to unfold like those little nesting dolls. Kudos to the developers your imagination rocks!!! Please MAKE MORE ROOM!!!!!!!
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|This movie was a ton of fun!  I had plenty of laugh out loud moments.  Cmon people, don't take it seriously, just have a good time!
B0045TYDNC|4.0|will keep the rear of the lens clean an protected when it's not on the camera while in storage when not beining used
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this show and its non stop drama.  The episodes are well written and the characters full of depth.
B00CM4VC7M|4.0|The figure is great, very posable.  I liked that I got the bonus faces.<br /><br />However, mine had a few paint chips, and the box wasn`t actually sealed when I got it.<br /><br />However, I am still happy that I ordered it.
B0044XV3R8|2.0|When I got this only the first 1/2 of the movie I could watch, as the 2nd dvd skipped. My favorite movie of all time to watch so I was really irritated to have purchased a set that skipped.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I just love this show  I caught up on it when my daughter in law told me  ive been hooked ever since
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|As a child of the 80's and growing up on Voltron, Godzilla, Transformers and everything else that inspires today's blockbusters, Pacific Rim is what I enjoy seeing at the movies. While no Oscars will be given out for the drama or character development in this simple larger-than-life movie, it contains all the elements of enjoying cinema in the digital age. Suspend your disbelief for two hours, grab some popcorn and watch giant robots beat the crap out of giant monsters...in 3D!! Great effects, great concept and a thrilling ride through Pacific Rim!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved the concept of the three books. Much to think about. Original idea. Writing was ok. Took a while to really relate to the characters (the Dauntless were too cold at the beginning) but later got attached to them.  I was contentedly reading the third book when all of a sudden something totally unexpected happened and I thought that it would be fixed and everything would be fine. It wasn't. I am AN ADULT and an old one at that.  That darn book was the biggest tear-jerker I've read in a long long time. Very upsetting because it just wasn't supposed to happen.  A book that can engage your interest, make you think, and tear your soul apart can't be too bad!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Love the The Big Bang Theory - best season yet! Can't wait for Season 7.<br />This was a gift to my husband. Thank you
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A beautiful, extremely well-written book! A very easy read. I believe that dog wrote it!  Great concept, lots of human interest appeal and realistic. You learn to really know this family and your heart is with them.
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|I deleted this from my kindle a long time ago because it just wasnt a good version. I prefer stimulating graphics and challenges
B009NXD6JM|4.0|This is an older movie that somehow I had not seen.  I was surprised and, in some ways, disappointed.  Not your usual romantic comedy.  And, Audrey Hepburn's role was not stereotypical.<br /><br />The scene is New York featuring a walk-up apartment building and residents. The leading man (George Peppard) was a youngish man trying to find his way.  Hepburn's role was an attractive and interesting person who, it was revealed, had an unusual history.  But, she was more sophisticated than one would expect knowing her background.<br /><br />It ends with a &#34;Happy Ever After&#34; ending, but one doubts that it will be lasting.  The Hepburn character seems too unstable to stay in the relationship.  The Peppard character seems destined for disappointment.<br /><br />Interesting, but unlikely and not very believable. I enjoyed it but I'd doubt I'll watch it again.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I bought this for halloween because I actually hadn't seen the last two movies. This is a great collection. The movies looked amazing and were amazing. The first four movies for some reason start right into the movie when you put them in and the last four go to menus.. which I through was weird but it didn't bother me.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|The movie is suspenseful with lots of twists as a dark sedan tracks the sheriff's every move.  Levon Helm (drummer for The Band) plays a great General Hood.
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|\\"I don't want to win, I just want to make the world a better place.\\" Since the arrival of Kick-Ass (Johnson) the entire city has become inspired and \\"super-heroes\\" begin popping up all over the place. Hit- Girl (Moretz) wants nothing more then to join them but made a promise to stay away from it. Still bent on revenge Chris D'Amico becomes more obsessed then ever and when he finds a way to get even he jumps at the chance. Leading a gang of super-villains he sets out to destroy everything he can until he finds Kick-Ass. I have to start by saying that I wasn't a fan of the first one. I'm not really sure what I didn't like but it just didn't click with me so I was not looking forward to this one and had low expectations. I don't know if that played a factor or not but this was surprisingly good and I liked it much more then the first one. As a warning (if you want to see this you may not need it) the movie really goes for shock value throughout most of it and is a little over the top, but all that actually fits in a movie like this. Funny, violent and a surprisingly good plot make this much better then the first one and I have to say that I really was entertained by it. Overall, a rare sequel that is better then the original. I surprisingly say B+.
B001RTSPVY|1.0|No, it certainly didn't meet my expectations! The only subtitles are in French!!<br />I have no idea what's gone on, but it has a distinctly fishy smell, and I won't be using that supplier again.<br />The same is true of the Complete Third Season, which I foolishly purchased at the same time. Never again!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Well before I played this game, I was so annoyed by all the buzz surrounding it.  But I decided to see what all the buzz was about and got hooked instantly.  Now I'm annoyed again because I can't seem to play the dang game without either playing the waiting game, paying money or begging my friends for help! Omg how annoying! Just let us play!!!!!!
B00G32VYDG|1.0|Poorly executed, pathetic attempt at a MiB type movie with dead people.  This movie was so mind numbing and awkward we ended up turning it off half way through.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Limited apps for it only 4 apps.  I want it ro show anything on phone or computer.  It does not
0307277453|3.0|This is very readable intro to evolutionary biology. It could be better if it had more illustrations to explain stuff. Also, the genetic basis of evolution is glanced over rather briefly, so it may not be really convincing to skeptics. There is much more to say than Hox genes. On the other hand, the publisher probably decided against a more extensive coverage of molecular biology to keep it short. Readers may have to resort to a book about genetics for a deeper understanding. (Disclaimer: I am a biologist, but I gave it to my wife who was completely ignorant about the fact that we are the descendents of fish and she learned quite a bit from it, she says)
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I bought this and it was better than I thought you can change game modes you can put stuff in your inventory that you never thought you could of had like chain armor it is awsome I would bye it
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|I wanted to love this version....The 12day filming proved to be its downfall. Alexis Denisof acting was tedious and difficult to watch. Amy Akcer was decent. The black and white seemed muddy and  did not add to the movie but it took meaning away. If you want to watch better versions try the Kenneth Branagh 1993 ... Or the 2009 version with David Tennant and Catherine Tate.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved it though not finished. Fanciful. Fun. Pictures in Words.  I want to go.  Wonder how it ends. Words required a bother.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like this game, but I am puzzled about which ones to select.  I am confused because when you think you have a match, you don,t and when you think you don't you do. Ok, I am not making sense I know, I am confused because when tiles are half there and covered I don't.  Can you understand what I am saying.  Anyway, that is confusing to me.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I've never have been very fond of shooting animals but this game is very fun and exciting!!! I think it's fun when the animal charges you just you get an adrenalin rush and you usually always hit it!! Get this game!! It is worth your time!!
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie-<br />movie - 5 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />i love all of Steven Soderbergh's movies, and this one is no<br />different. very good,intense drama that you can really relate to<br />should you get deeply involved into the film.<br />great video and audio.<br />recommended...
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I have to say, im not normally impressed with movies like this but this is one of the best movies ive ever seen, definatly a 5 star movie. The cast was absolutly incredible, Leonardo Dicaprio gave such an amazing performance. The music was awesome and I loved the costumes, both really reflected the fun yet historical era. Another thing is that the movie has so much emotion, very rarly do movies make me cry but this movie made me smile, cry, and im a little embaressed to say I found myself sobbing at the end. I recommend this movie to everyone I know. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie definatly should. :)
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good old Stephen King........Nice to have a good read once again..can't wait for the movie....I can see Toby Mcguire in the lead....
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I liked this book because it was like the Hunger Games but better.  This book off of book one, but one must read The Maze Runner first.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Casting from netflix and Google play is excellent with standard internet. casting/ steraming from the internet (ie abc and nbc web sites) can be a little glitchy
B003YOXINU|5.0|This is one of my favourite Peter Gabriel albums. It followed So, and has a similar tenor in voice and style. Very introspective. Love, the exploration and fight for it.  Steam is very much like Sledgehammer. On this writing, it is almost, if not, 20 years old. I hadn't heard it for a while and was not disappointed with my revisit to that world of music. Kiss that Frog, go for it, you'll not be disappointed. Gabriel always has the best of musicians around him. My opinion...
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Great book from Bryan Peterson. I learned a lot from this book and his videos up on the Adorama website. Thank you Amazon. A+
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is, perhaps, the height of Mark Knopfler's epic journey into orchestral rock arrangements and style of play. A taste of Brothers In Arms and music from On Every Street. Guitars mix and match from rock to Spanish; Dobro to gut string and everything in between. If nothing else, this a musician's heaven. Pick Withers appears on drums for some of the album; he never plays an eighth note when he can use a 16th, nor a 16th  when he can do a 32nd triplet. Knopfler's lyrics, as usual, academic in their poetic form. The sophistication of the recording very evident in the 3 dimensionality of the work. Sometimes it feels like I'm sitting in the middle of a band and listening. If you like Dire Straits at all, I recommend. My opinion, I could be wrong.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Game could be better starting.  Learning to play is slow with this game.<br />Fun little slow starting.  It will be fun for people who have not seen the movie
B00DWZHTOU|3.0|\\"Now You See Me\\" has a reasonably interesting premise that has a lot of promise, as well as a great cast including two Oscar-winners Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. What could have been a great film is ruined - if not completely - by one simple mistake: overuse of special effects. Just imagine a classic \\"Sting\\" with CGI. That's \\"Now You See Me.\\"<br /><br />The film begins promisingly with four magicians \\"The Four Horsemen\\" - played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco - a group that pulls off a heist in Paris while being on stage in Las Vegas. Their incredible feat (that apparently involves teleportation) naturally attracts the attention of the public, and of course, the FBI agent played by Mark Ruffalo.<br /><br />I know in this kind of fast-paced narrative, some part of the story often remain unanswered. Some (or most) situations are contrived, with characters making strange decisions. That's fine, as long as tricks are smart. That is not the case with \\"Now You See Me,\\" however, where thinly drawn characters and overused special effects during the key scenes only make us realize that the filmmakers including director Louis Leterrier (\\"The Transporter\\" \\"Clash of the Titans\\") are only interested in tricking us, but not in how.<br /><br />That doesn't mean the film is a total mess. \\"Now You See Me\\" is entertaining, but not enough for us to watch again.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|had this movie not been about Superman, it probably would have received better reviews. But it would seem the public just can't accept it when something is different. It is a fantastic film and accomplished what it set out to do, which was re-imagine Superman for a new generation. What matters is that the movie did stay extremely close the original source material and didn't alter characters as to where they no longer resembled their comic counterparts (I'm talking to you, Batman & Robin).<br /><br />And even if the movie wasn't perfect, far worse movies have been made. People are acting as if this was a complete line by line remake of Superman IV (An exaggeration, but after reading some of the things that have been said, a person who has not seen the movie would probably expect to see something of the quality of Superman IV)<br /><br />I do agree there was too much action, but I can forgive that after being denied good Superman films since the 1980's. I think Zack Snyder was trying to make up for 30 years of bad Superman films. I probably would have still enjoyed the movie anyway if it was just Superman lashing out at bad guys from start to finish.<br /><br />One last thing to think about is that this is merely Superman's Origin and last but not least, Clark Kents Origin. This movie was given bad ratings because of how it had very little soul to it or any happiness that we've seen in the Richard Donner films, but we must remember that the Donner films were almost completely about how Clark Kent alternated between his public life and his life as Superman, and in Man of Steel, Kal-El only becomes the true Clark Kent at the very end of the movie. If that doesn't tell us anything about what we should expect from future films than nothing will. We all need to keep in mind that this simply the first movie, and like the start of many great movie series, the first movie is always the one in which the creative team behind it figures out what works and what doesn't.<br /><br/>When you look at this movie in the most basic way possible, it is simply reminding us how Kal-El came to earth and became Clark Kent, not Superman.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I think this is a great &quot;mini&quot; app. I say mini because it would work great for me as a supplemental alarm clock, but it would need to have a greater volume capacity to really get me awake. Even at full volume on my Kindle, it sounds more like background music than &quot;GET OUT OF BED NOW!!!!&quot;  However, the set up is easy, the chooses are good, and I like the multi-alarm feature. I would recommend it- esp since I have a feeling that speakers would enhance the volume capacity.
034580404X|5.0|The moment I begin reading hte 1st few pages of he book, I could not stop reading it until.  I finished reading it in 48 hours.  I could not stop reading it.<br /><br />For me there's some lessons in relationship you can learn other than the sexual stuff.  I bought the set and I can't wait to read the next volume &#34;Darker.&#34;<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app has everything a beginner DJ could need and more. You can pick the songs you like and depending on which two songs you pick you can mix them together. Also I'd like to point out that it has several different skins and effects to add to your music. Honestly, I'm quite surprised that this app is free.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always, Grisham delivers a story that you can't put down.  Sycamore Row is one of his best. Second only to my favorite, A Time to Kill
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Google seems to have gotten pretty commercial.  If I want to look up entertainers it is fast and easy.  General information, not so much anymore.  I like the feature of being able to type in a question, but not having to sort through thousands of answers.  Doesn't work as well on a tablet as I'd hoped.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very happy with this app!  the previous app I had kept crashing when I needed it most. thank you for a great app!
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This is an amazing addition to your Evernote setup, has features you will want, and paper cookbooks will soon be passe', for example.  I plan to use it for a travelogue - see me in the forest, photo, map and trail description described!
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Entertaining, not overly done, fair action, but not too far out with the wiz bang blow them up type of movie.  Some suspense to it, but predictable.  For a nice evening movie to watch this should do it.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I like being able to use the touch screen on my kindle fire to teach or demonstrate.  It is more socially acceptable than focussing on a keyboard type calculator when trying to work out shares of expenses or dimensions of a room with someone.  Multistep problems are handled easily and well, if you know algebra and still want to see the steps.  So, I like it, but still use calculators or pencils more often, to avoid powering up the tablet and having to recharge.  Yes, it takes a lot of juice if you want to leave this app open for awhile, like any graphic-interactive program.
B009EEGWOQ|5.0|There's nothing about this album I don't like.  Every song is a classic ELP progressive rock masterpiece !  The extra songs on this collection just make it that much better.
B008M721MS|4.0|Skype is great, the only thing better is being able to have it with me when my European friends are awake and I am at work.  I can take a break, talk for a few minutes, it's good.  A little rough getting this one set up, but once it was done, all I had to do was be near WiFi.  Looking forward to using it for travel.
B00FJRDABA|5.0|Cath(er) is not thrilled about starting at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Ever since her twin sister, Wren, decided she wanted them to meet new people instead of being a package-deal and roommates, Cath has been panicking about rooming with a complete stranger and who she'll eat with at dinner and how long she'll be able to live off of snack bars. For another, she doesn't feel great about leaving their single-dad behind to look after himself and hope he doesn't let his creative-genius get the better of him and buy all of his meals at the gas station.<br /><br />For another, Cath isn't so sure about the fiction writing course she's taking. Sure, she writes - fanfiction. Simon Snow fanfiction, Simon and Baz slash fanfiction, to be more precise. But does she have it in her to create entire characters and worlds that don't belong to Gemma T. Leslie? Cath isn't so sure, and she's not so sure about how she'll get creative writing assignments finished when she's also trying to finish her epic `Carry On, Simon' fanficiton before GMT's eighth and final Simon Snow book is released.<br /><br />But it turns out Cath is going to have a lot more to worry about than just her dad, sister and the awaiting Baz/Simon fans. Cath tentatively befriends her prickly roommate, Reagan, but also falls for her boyfriend Levi, as much as socially-awkward, hermit Cath can fall for anyone. Then there's the creative fiction study-buddy she's mildly crushing on, and the old family wounds Wren has decided to re-open against Cath's wishes. As her first year at UNL progresses, Cath is forced to live more outside of her own slash-fic and confront some bad guys not of Gemma T. Leslie's creation.<br /><br />`Fangirl' is the new novel from Rainbow Rowell (probably marketed in that hot `New Adult' market, but likewise appealing for young adults and regular adults too).<br /><br />You guys. YOU GUYS! This book is the cherry on top, the cream in the middle and the caramel drizzle all rolled into one. This book is probably my absolute favourite from 2013 so far, and that's a darn big call.<br /><br />I'm sure there are many, many readers out there like me who have been excited for this book ever since the synopsis came out and struck that particular nerdy-nerve in all of us.<br /><br />fan*girl [fan-gurl]<br />Often Disparaging. An obsessive female fan, especially of something technological or from popular culture.<br /><br />Because I am a fangirl about many things, and I used to write fanfiction myself.<br /><br />fan*fic [fan-fik]<br />1. fiction written by fans of a TV series, movie, etc., using existing characters and situations to develop new plots.<br />2. a work of fiction in this genre.<br /><br />I especially loved the idea of an author writing about this sub-culture in an affectionate way. Especially because authors haven't always been terribly kind to the realm of fanfiction - whether it be blasting EL James for outselling the fandom she adapted her erotica from, or likening fanfiction writing to `rape' (this one kills me, because it was said by one of my FAVOURITE authors and I disagree, wholeheartedly). But the moment Rainbow Rowell announced this as her next project, I knew it would be something very balanced, respectful and bring something interesting to the fanfiction world - and I was right.<br /><br />At first I thought Rainbow Rowell wrote Cath as quite the stereotypical fanfiction nerd - a girl who enjoys being cooped up in her room, spinning stories around her favourite stories and particularly favouring a homosexual-bent between characters who are heterosexual in the canon. That's fine though - because Wren used to write fanfiction and she's the `cool' twin, and while at University Cath inadvertently meets other people invested in Simon Snow fanfiction (even her own) who she'd never suspect because they don't fit the stereotype.<br /><br />But in the meantime I loved how truthfully Rowell portrayed Cath as this girl with hundreds of thousandsof online followers who are hanging on her every word, but in the real world she tries to keep her geeky double-life on the down-low.<br /><br />There's plenty of comedic fodder around fanfiction and fangirling, and Rowell explores them brilliantly. I laughed out loud while reading this, and even though lots of people will come to this book and know exactly what Rowell and Cath are talking about with the underground fanfiction world, I also think `Fangirl' will be really accessible, funny and a great introduction for people who are totally clueless about fandoms.<br /><br />Cath really is the draw-card of this book though. Rowell just writes Cath to perfection, and with utter tenderness. I think lots of people who are introverted and don't like people/crowds are instantly labelled as hopelessly shy, but that's not always the case. I know plenty of quiet people who just hate social situations, but get them one-on-one and they're a laugh-riot and massive show-offs. That's Cath. Yes, she's panicked by the thought of not knowing where the dining hall is and doing that awkward standing-with-a-tray-of-food thing (so avoids the dining hall for one whole month) but she's wicked smart, has a quick wit and feisty personality that she starts to show off to those around her. But that part of her that panics at the thought of new routines and meeting strangers en masse is so relatable to the less extroverted of us, and Rowell writes that pitch-perfectly.<br /><br />While reading `Fangirl' I also thought there was a lot of Rowell shining through, and her own experiences. Because a big part of the book is Cath being comfortable with her own voice (not just Gemma T. Leslie's) and sharing her writing with the world, even becoming confident in her craft and calling herself a writer. At one point, her fiction-writing lecturer tells Cath that her characters practically `quiver on the page' and that sounded so much like the sort of praise I can imagine Rowell receiving. This book will also speak to a lot of people about art and creating, writing especially, and how much showing your writing to people and believing in your work takes practice, patience and confidence. There are lots of threads in `Fangirl' and this is just one of them, but it's beautifully plotted.<br /><br />And, of course, there's also the romantic element. Look, I am in the minority for people who did not adore Rowell's `Eleanor and Park' (and I mean the minority - just looking at the back cover of `Fangirl' with all the praise for `Eleanor and Park' is pretty impressive. But I'm still not swayed). But I love, love, loved her debut `Attachments'. That book was funny and romantic and totally unique in its romance. `Fangirl' has romantic links closer to `Attachments' than `Eleanor and Park', and for that I was very grateful.<br /><br />The romance in this book is superb. It's a slow-unfolding, but a worthwhile one - especially because Rowell even throws a red-herring love interest into the mix early on to keep things especially interesting. But I loved the romance in `Fangirl' mostly because (as with `Attachments') it's all about these two people falling in love with each other's personalities over more superficial things. I doubt Rowell would ever be so inclined to write love-at-first-sight, because her slow-boiling romances are just so darn good with big helpings of believability mixed with utter sweetness.<br /><br />I also have to give big kudos to this book for exploring mental illness. And not in a prescribed, easy-to-remedy, after school special kind of way but with a lot of grittiness, heartache, anxiety and reality. There are a lot of threads to this book. There's also a storyline to do with Cath and Wren's returned mother, but it's used more for character exploration than as a plot-crutch and I even admired that (again, more reality, and no neatly-tied conclusions to messy situations).<br /><br />I just loved `Fangirl'; I can't even begin to tell you how much. I laughed, I cried . . .  yadda, yadda, yadda. More importantly I immediately knew this was my book of 2013 - the one that has just made my (already phenomenal) reading year just that extra bit special. Bring on `Landline' for 2014!also speak to a lot of people about art and creating, writing especially, and how much showing your writing to people and believing in your work takes practice, patience and confidence.

It's a slow-unfolding, but a worthwhile one - especially because Rowell even throws a red-herring love interest into the mix early on to keep things especially interesting. But I loved the romance in `Fangirl' mostly because (as with `Attachments') it's all about these two people falling in love with each other's personalities over more superficial things. I doubt Rowell would ever be so inclined to write love-at-first-sight, because her slow-boiling romances are just so darn good with big helpings of believability mixed with utter sweetness.<br /><br />I also have to give big kudos to this book for exploring mental illness. And not in a prescribed, easy-to-remedy, after school special kind of way but with a lot of grittiness, heartache, anxiety and reality. There are a lot of threads to this book. There's also a storyline to do with Cath and Wren's returned mother, but it's used more for character exploration than as a plot-crutch and I even admired that (again, more reality, and no neatly-tied conclusions to messy situations).<br /><br />I just loved `Fangirl'; I can't even begin to tell you how much. I laughed, I cried . . .  yadda, yadda, yadda. More importantly I immediately knew this was my book of 2013 - the one that has just made my (already phenomenal) reading year just that extra bit special. Bring on `Landline' for 2014!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Originally saw this on DVD.  Graphics are great.  Story pr<br />ovocative.  Dicaprio much better actor since growing up.  Combination of  great actors and excellent plot have made this one a good addition.to our collection.

B000MV8ABS|5.0|This is one of the most original and imaginative horror films ever made. While the movie is dated, being made in 1977 and released in 1978, the story more than makes up for it. Much like the original Dawn of the Dead, you notice the obvious short comings of the special FX, and yet, you find yourself drawn into the world of PHANTASM.<br />The film finds its strength in the unusual structure of its story. It unfolds like a disturbing dream, throwing you unexpected curves and combining seemingly random yet haunting images and situations. There are no safe places in this film, only the delusions of a disturbed mind. Any film fan with an imagination and any degree of intelligence NEEDS to see this film. Even if you hate it, there is a certain hipster aspect to saying you've seen it. But I still can't believe anyone would hate this film unless they just expected the usual Hollywood horror movie, because this ISN'T one of those.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS! I have followed this series from the very beginning and WAS one of my favorite series. I read constantly and this is my first review because I felt like I could not sit back and not warn other readers and lovers of this series to turn back now! Re-read the first 2 books and make up your own ending in your head! In the first two books I fell in love with all of it, the factions, the characters, Tobias and Tris. I felt a connection to Tris and her strength and determination. This third book was a little hard for me to get through because it was just seemed to drag on but I told myself it will be worth it to see the ending of my beloved characters. But it ends with Tris dying, Uriah dying, all of their grief, especially Tobias. Then flash forward to two years later where everyone is trying to move on but still heartbroken and there's still a GD rebel army ready for another war. THE END. I'm sorry I read this third book and hope other people spare themselves the heartache.

B0015HOFZI|1.0|My first Sony turntable lasted over 30 years. So when it finally gave out, I wasn't going to buy anything but a Sony.<br /><br />This turntable lasted a grand total of 62 days. The sound quality I would give a B+ for the price. I never tried to hook it up to my computer so I can't comment on it's functionality. Clearly, Sony quality is not what it used to be. I will be sending it back to get it replaced under the warranty at my own cost and wasted time. The limited warranty is a 3 month and a less comprehensive 1 year. But it is a potential added cost if you are considering this low quality product.<br /><br />Update: Don't even bother trying to get your warranty fulfilled. Won't happen. Save yourself the hassle and throw it in the trash. Lesson learned. Sony support makes AOL support in the 90s look like a dream. Seriously, something is very wrong with it's management.
0143120581|5.0|This is one of the funniest, smartest, most thought-provoking books I've read in a long time. If you don't like it, you are dead to me.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I very much enjoyed this story. I'm eagerly waiting for the next installment to see what else these people get up to.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|it's one of the few good sci fi shows out there. Good character development with a few twists.  It could have a little more pure sci fi and less drama.
0316055433|3.0|It is with some distress that I could not rank this one higher. I still waiver on giving it 3.5 stars because I do think this writer is gifted. The problem is there's too much here--sometimes good pruning and cutting makes a better story overall. And I don't know what happened to good editing, but there are far too many 800 page works of fiction out there these days. In Dickens' time, it made sense (there was not all this media we have today).  But Dickens kept the story-clip going. Tartt loses her narrative thread, despite good character-development. There were times I wondered why I was continuing to read--and I had to skim through the thicket of too much prose. All in all, I don't think this author will ever surpass the masterful first novel she produced some 20 years ago.<br /><br />With all the praise and marketing heaped on this read, it can only disappoint.
B005LAIIMG|2.0|Being a fan of the genre, I was looking forward to seeing this.  But not THIS.<br /><br />I would have only given this one star, except I discovered so many things I didn't know before.  Like the UN has its own naval fleet.  Like there is an international commercial airport within walking distance of Jerusalem's Old City.  Like there is a world class disease research facility near Cardiff.  Like you can blow the back off a plane and it doesn't fall out of the sky immediately, or like you can cut off somebody's hand and stop it bleeding with a rudimentary bandage.  Or that you can use a satellite phone from within the bowels of a ship.  Or that it only takes half an hour to drive from Midtown Manhattan to Newark.

B008JFUPPI|4.0|&#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; is yet another example of a film killed by early bad press. Based on the Dark Horse comic book, this supernatural action/comedy is quite a bit of fun. Is the storyline predictable and recycled from other films of this nature? Of course it is; but you don't stop riding rollercoasters just because one has the same amount of loops another one does at the other end of the amusement park.<br /><br />After meeting his own demise, a crooked Boston cop (Ryan Reynolds) is given a choice in the afterlife. Join the forces of the &#34;Rest in Peace Department&#34; and hunt down Deados or take his chances on Judgment Day. He partners up with a former Wild West lawman (Jeff Bridges) to hunt down criminal souls who refuse to vacate the Earth after death and face their eternal punishment. The two discover a plot to reverse the tunnel to the afterlife, allowing millions of corrupt and angry souls to invade the world.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges pours himself into the role of an old-fashioned Wild West sheriff struggling with the modern excesses of the world. Ryan Reynolds looks like he's having a good time, as well. You can tell Kevin Bacon loves playing a bad guy and he shows it here.<br /><br />The DVD version of &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; includes a few bonus features. There are deleted and alternate scenes accompanied by a gag reel. A featurette entitled &#34;Transferring 'R.I.P.D.' - The Making of&#34; takes viewers behind the scenes of the film.<br /><br />&#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; is rated PG-13 for violence, sci-fi/fantasy action, some sensuality, and language including sex references. I agree with all of the above warnings. Also, the monsters in the movie are rather cartoonish and not as scary as one might think. There's nothing too over-the-top visually to be found. It's as safe as any of the &#34;Men in Black&#34; movies.<br /><br />As you would imagine, any references to God are removed from &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; Instead, Jeff Bridges' character refers to the ruling power as &#34;The Universe.&#34; However, there's nothing I would say is religiously offensive as far as content is concerned.<br /><br />Although the CGI shows its limits quite a bit, it's not enough to rob &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; of the humor, wit, and energy it exudes. If you long for a light-hearted supernatural adventure you can enjoy while veg'ing out on the couch and eating popcorn, this is your movie. It very much wears its influences on its sleeve - a nice mix of &#34;Men in Black&#34; and a tamer &#34;Constantine.&#34; Basically, just replace aliens with dead people who mutate into monsters and you have a good idea of what to expect.s &#34;The Universe.&#34; However, there's nothing I would say is religiously offensive as far as content is concerned.<br /><br />Although the CGI shows its limits quite a bit, it's not enough to rob &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; of the humor, wit, and energy it exudes.

140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan looks at the historical Jesus of Nazareth from the perspective of a true historian. He studied all the sources it can be studied and made all inferences there can be made. His Jesus is not a complete one due to historical processes of politics and religion that managed to erase all but a tiny vestige of historical memories--although his portrait of this man called Jesus is as complete as anyone can get. The image of Jesus he so beautifully, scholarly, and skillfully constructed is the clearest yet--as he had lucidly managed to remove all the thick layers of ahistorical description of the real man.<br /><br />It needs not to be spelled out to anyone that Aslan, in writing this book, and in conforming to the proper historical writing, has zero political correctness in communicating his objective observations to all types of readers--all of those who are willing to engage in a discussion with him.
B002ZM74Y6|4.0|Goodfellas is an outstanding movie.  I have heard quotes from it and references to it for many years.  It is a movie that you won't soon forget.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars not because of its qualities but for how its qualities matched my expectations for a movie of its type.<br /><br />Based on references I had heard to Joe Pesci's famous clown tirade, I thought it might be a comedy.  Goodfellas is not a comedy.<br /><br />This is a violent movie.  There are frequent violent confrontations, beatings, shootings and graphic mutilations.  This violence is consistent with the story and it supports the lessons of the movie but it can be a little overwhelming - even for someone who loves MMA and the UFC like I do.  Unlike MMA, this violence is usually carried out on unwillingly victims who are unable to defend themselves.  Many of these victims are actually friends of the assailant.<br /><br />There are many conflicts (not all violent) between the protagonist and other characters (especially women) that are never resolved.  This is, once again, consistent with the theme of the move but it is still disquieting.<br /><br />Like all great movies, Goodfellas will provide entertainment and insight to anyone who sees it.  If you are sensitive to the concerns listed above, however, you may want to proceed with caution.

B000002JKA|5.0|I'll preface this review by saying I've had a bit of an \\"on again/off again\\" relationship with Dream Theater over the last few decades. I think this has been the case with many of their fans as, let's face it, they haven't always blown me away. While each album has its shining moments (they really have no \\"bad\\" albums in my humble opinion), there are very few that are listenable from start to finish. As a fan of progressive rock and metal, I know there is a fine line between well executed musicianship and music college \\"look what I can do\\" wankery. When Dream Theater is running on all cylinders, they are masters of their craft. I purchased \\"Images And Words\\" at a used music store back in 95 on a whim. Having only heard of them once or twice when mentioned by friends in passing, I must have missed out when \\"Pull Me Under\\" was a \\"hit song\\". Here in NC, radio isn't exactly prog-friendly. Not to get too side tracked, I immediately fell in love with it. From start to finish, \\"Images\\" was an album to be listened to multiple times to savor each nuance of the incredible songwriting and musicianship. To get to my point, I thought \\"Images\\" would be their \\"be-all-to-end-all\\" album and really didn't think they would be able to surpass it...that is until a friend suggested \\"Awake\\".<br /><br />I know this may seem like an odd comparison, but if \\"Images\\" would be considered to be DT's \\"Star Wars\\", then \\"Awake\\" would certainly be considered to be their \\"Empire Strikes Back\\". It didn't hit me right away. It didn't strike a chord and blow me away simply because it is a MUCH darker album than \\"Images\\". First of all, having never heard a seven-string before, I was a bit put off by the guitar tones in places. Secondly, where \\"Images\\" is full of high energy and a dash of \\"pop\\" sensibilities in the songwriting, \\"Awake\\" seemed very brooding and almost too \\"introverted\\" (for lack of a better term). In going back to my earlier (albeit odd) comparison, many Star Wars fans had a hard time swallowing \\"Empire\\" for its dark tones. For me, listening to \\"Awake\\" was very similar. At the end of the day, however, most Star Wars fans consider \\"Empire\\" to be the best of ALL the Star Wars films...just as I consider \\"Awake\\" to be my favorite Dream Theater album to date.<br /><br />From the very fusion-ish opener \\"6:00\\" to the incredibly gothic toned \\"Space Dyed Vest\\", it is varied in energy and pacing. As this would be Kevin Moore's final album with the band, one has to wonder if his disillusionment creeped its way into the songwriting and recording. If this is the case, I'm glad it did. This album feels very personal. There are tones of anger, agression, and hints of sadness all over it. Eventually, I found myself listening to this album from start to finish much more than its predecessor. To me, \\"Awake\\" must be listened to in its entirety to get the full effect. None of the songs come off as easily listenable on their own. In the age of MP3 players and I PODs, when any of these songs come on in \\"shuffle\\" mode, it seems disjointed to me. Don't get me wrong, I'll listen to any track on this album in any order with delight. However, \\"Awake\\" plays best in its original track order.<br /><br />John Lennon has said that \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was not a concept album and any track on that masterpiece could have been on any other album, but it worked as a concept because they said it did. Granted, I'm making yet another odd comparison. That said, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" tracks sound disjointed when played out of order. The same could be said for \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" or \\"The Wall\\". While \\"Awake\\" isn't a concept album, it almost plays like one. I'm not sure if the order was intentional, but it just feels right to me. The funniest thing of all is that I didn't even remember the song titles, even after multiple listens. It just played like one long piece of music, like a suite, with multiple movements yet all encompassed and relevant to each other. It is hypnotic and strikes a chord with me like no album before it or since.<br /><br />If I had to pick the stand out tracks in this review, I'd have to go with \\"Caught In A Web\\", \\"Voices\\", \\"Erotomania\\", and \\"Innocence Faded\\"...with \\"Space Dyed Vest\\" thrown in there for good measure.

006202406X|1.0|Very disappointing ending to the series. I guess the author doesn't care if the movies are a success but I would have thought those around her would have given her better advice. Giving the books away - will never reread them as I have other series. Will not see the movie either.
006202406X|5.0|I saw so many negative reviews from ebook readers complaining about the outcome of the book before my hard copy had even shipped. It made me anxious to read the book, hoping I wouldn't be let down after really enjoying the first two. The upside to reading the reviews is that, &#34;Forewarned is forearmed&#34;.  I was prepared to read something that didn't have life for the characters tied up in a nice little bow with hearts and flowers everywhere.<br />That being said, this book is so worth the read. There are profound passages, in the book, that I wish I could quote that I think are excellent lessons for everyone dealing with hard things in their life. The author was brave enough to be realistic and the reader can learn that life doesn't always turn out the way you want it to.

Hear the story of his life how he recollects it for the historian, that is forced to travel with him, in Name-of-the-wind-esque way.<br /><br />I was torn between three and four stars for the most of the book and I wasn't sure why so many people give it high score. Then the finale part come up and I was smitten. Everything clicked together and I felt amazed. I didn't read more satisfying finale for a long time. Now I'm torn between four and five starts. But f* it, I give it five because this book was a joy to read, there was always something interesting happening and I liked that even if main hero was destined to be a special, he was often not that much special. The only negative I could think of is that I had huge problem with remembering the names of the most nobles. All that names were blending together, maybe because of that &#34;Al&#34; prefix.<br /><br />Definitely looking forward to the next book in series. But I would have accept this one as standalone story if there would be no other ones planned, so don't hesitate to try it even if you don't want to start with another epic fantasy saga.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I feel like the author who wrote the first book and the one who wrote this last book are two different people.  The story line and the ending of this last book are so bad that I wish I could take memory serum and only remember the first two.  Considering this is a young adult series, I was surprised that there was not a happier ending.  If you loved the factions, post-apocalyptic atmosphere, or Tris and Four, DO NOT read this last part.  Sit happy in your ignorance.  I wish I could.
B005LJITS0|5.0|It's been decades since I picked up a \\"Green Lantern\\" comic book, but I do remember the hero and his ring.<br /><br />So I was pleasantly surprised to find the story easy to follow, with things moving along at just the right pace with the back story to keep me from getting bored.<br /><br />Note to the bad reviewers: This is a superhero movie!<br /><br />If you can't let go with your imagination and just enjoy a dramatic adventure with cool special effects, then this movie is not for you.<br /><br />Many folks will point to all the \\"unbelievable\\" things in this movie that supposedly make it poor or bad, and yet these are the same, militant movie watchers who find it ridiculously easy to believe that a multi-millionaire can run around a huge city in a bat suit fighting crime! Or, that a baby from Krypton can leap tall buildings in a single bound.<br /><br />They're SUPERHERO movies that are supposed to inspire us with tales of good vs. evil.<br /><br />These days, too many movies waste their time on graphic violence and exaggerated character angst.<br /><br />I would like to see a sequel please. Or maybe the Lantern could make a brief pit stop in the new Superman/Batman flick!

B000I62JBE|3.0|So so film. I thought it was rather predictable. I usually like DeNiro and Norton but I don't see this as a great movie. It's a good movie to have going in the background as you're doing housework (how I watched it).

B00B2QA646|3.0|This was the strangest movie I have ever watched. I didn't know what I was seeing was real, a dream, a flashback or if my eyes were deceiving my brain..What a strange combination of imagination and reality. I had to go online to figure out what I had just spent 2 hours watching. One minute you think it is a play and the next minute horses are running through on a stage..way too complicated a portrayal of a great story. Now I need to read the original story by Tolstoy!

B004UHL9EK|4.0|I use this daily for my breaks and lunches at work.  I also use it for doing laundry since the dryer has no buzzer. My only complaint is that the widgets need work. If you click the widget once it starts the timer, but if you hit it a second time, it stops the timer rather than showing you how much time is left on the timer.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I did enjoy this book. I found the characters very real, much like people we all know. The secret when we find out what it is, challenges us. You ask yourself as you are reading what would you do if you found out that secret.  It's almost like you want to go back a chapter and not find out.  It is clever a story that uses lots of twists and turns but all comes together in the end.

B007C3TVNA|5.0|No doubt I believe this movie should be viewed by all parents those day and age. The world has changed in many ways primarily technology. This film reminds us that we cannot raise our kids by handing them smartphones, car keys, and video games. Love is #1 and a child can sense rejection, inadequacy, and aloofness without us saying a word. Its sensed strongly and Kevin obviously feels that animosity and it leads to a lost,  cold, vengeful young man. Ezra and Tilda are amazing in their roles. Slow paced but very worth the impact.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|The writing in this book reminded me of a first book instead of the last. It just wasn't the same quality as the other two book's. Personally it was refreshing for a book to end the way this one did. Otherwise, I think the publishers pushed this ending too earl and seemed raw.

1401938906|5.0|The author has taken a deep, complex and controversial subject and created a book that anyone can understand and best of all, marvel at the results of the nine experiments proving that we are all connected and that there is far more to life than explained by religions.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I have read a bunch of clunkers lately so this book was a very pleasant surprise.  This book is well written and an easy read...it took me two days. The book kept me engaged until the end.  Even if you figure the main secret out early in the book, you still want to read on to find out the resolution. It's worth your time & money.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Never before has an author let down a reader as bad as Veronica Roth has with Allegiant. I was that reader that could not put down Divergent or Insurgent. I read the books over and over anxiously awaiting the release of Allegiant. The day Allegiant came out I was at Barnes and Nobles as soon as they opened. For 2 days I devoted my time to finishing the book.  For the first half of the book I found myself extremely bored and annoyed. The storyline of the book almost seems forced. Like Roth had to come up with some idea to create a third story. I could have thought of so many different avenues she could have taken other than the one she did but whatever. I began skim reading certain parts of chapters so I could move forward in the book to parts that included Tris & Four. After all their love story had become the story did it not? Instead the book only frustrated me further. Each chapter is based off of either Four or Tris's point of view, not just Tris who is actually the main character. We should have seen this coming with all the lame short stories regarding Four that Roth has released. She is trying to milk her readers for every penny. Divergent and Insurgent were based on Tris's life and so should have been Allegiant. If Roth wanted to tell a point of view from Four then she should have taken advice from Stephanie Meyer when she did so in Breaking Dawn. Meyer told the point of view of Jacob but only did so in half the book, finishing the book from the main characters point of view. SPOILER ALERT: But Roth could not do that could she. Sadly Roth is one of those authors who tries to be creative and winds up ruining her whole trilogy. Divergent and Insurgent makes you fall in love with Tris and Four and has you rooting for their happy ending only to have crushed by Roth. The ending only leaves you sad and angry. Four once again is miserable and will be since his soul mate is no longer with him. He finally finds happiness only to have it taken from him. Even addressing that scene, Roth swayed away from her character so much just so she could kill her off.  Knowing Tris's character and that she is dauntless, why would she ever drop her gun or never try to disarm her attacker! Come on! I guess the biggest disappointment was because life is hard enough and I don't read books to be reminded of all the wrong things that can happen. I read to escape this and read how even with life's obstacles, there still can be a happy ending. Well if you are looking for that then stop reading after insurgent. In all honesty I could not wait for Allegiant to come out and the movie to come out but after this MASSIVE disappointment, I don't even want to see the movie. It will only anger me even more to know what happens in the end.  One can only that Hollywood will step in and change the ending of allegiant to make it better so that the bad guys don't prevail but good does.  In the end, I will never buy another Veronica Roth book again. The fact that I not only wasted 20 bucks on a horrible, upsetting book but I also wasted 2 days of my life reading this awful book and I can never get back either!!
B00DNNQNW0|5.0|Katie Melua could sing the alphabet and sound like an angel. I recommend any of her albums if you enjoy gentle easy listening, jazz , blues.... She is very broad ranged. In this album, she has an orchestra which is wonderful,but its not her best album in my opinion. This is well worth buying and brings enjoyment well worth more than the cost. Get this CD!!

B00AZMFO9U|5.0|Fabulous cast, gorgeous settings and a wonderful story.  Might sound uninteresting given that it's set in a retirement home, but it's a wonderful film - well acted, well directed, and thoroughly engrossing.  I actually bought it the day it came out and watched it twice back-to-back.  First like a regular way then again listening to Dustin Hoffman's comments.  I've shown it to friends and family over and over and I don't seem to ever get tired of it.  Still get teary in spots, howl with laughter, and get goosebumps at the end.  If you like music of any type, appreciate fine acting and have a sense of humor, it's a must!  Be sure to watch the credits and have your thumb ready on the pause button - you'll need it!

0307719227|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book because of the various historical examples cited by the authors and because of their main theory: that geography or cultural heritage is less important than economics and legal institutions in a nation's status as a first , second, or third tier nation on planet earth. Countries are more likely to escape poverty if they have appropriate economic and political institutions in place. Egyptians are poor because of the corrupt inefficient government in place.  It is the way it is due to the manner in which political power is exercised, namely by a monopoly--i.e. a concentration of political power in a narrow elite segment of society rather than a broad based swath of the countries overall population base.  Extractive types of governments make the country and it's citizens poorer.  Whereas, in nations which have a broad based set of voters with at least a middle class education and jobs and wealth, you will find a society of sufficient wealth rather than poverty.  Whether we are describing North Korea, Sierra Leone, or Zimbabwe, those countries citizens are poor, and have a precarious standard of living for the same reason Egypt has.  Whereas, countries like Great Britain and the United States became rich due in part because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled poltiical power and created a society where political rights were much more widespread and broadly distributed among society, and were government observed the rule of law and was accountable to the electorate of the citizenry , which in turn enabled the great mass of the citizens to take advantage of eonomic opportunties and keep most of the weath for themselves instead of seeing it taken from them and transferred into the pockets of the elites in business or government who controlled the nation.<br />  The comparisons between North and South Korea and Nogales, Arizon, U.S.A. and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico could not be so different and tends to support their book's thesis.<br />  However, having praised their book, I must still agree with three other critical and disenting reviewers of this book namely, Waifarius Chilensis (3 Star review), Jackal (2 star review) , and ADan's (1 star review).  I believe these three critics make valid critical points of the book's defects.  So I urge the authors to take the 3 critics views into account and then rewrite their book based upon those three critics assessments.  Yet, I still  believe the book is worth reading as it is and so strongly recommend it's reading for the general public, and especially for all government officials in all nations worldwide, because I still think their main thesis is correct even if some of the evidence they cite to support their arguments might be a logical streach as my 3 above named critics have indicated.<br />Sinerely,<br />Terry Jennrich

B000BRBA8S|5.0|I don't believe it is a must to watch the two movies, Days of Being Wild and In the Mood for Love, before watching this third installment of a loosely based trilogy by Wong Kar Wai.  Each of these movies stand alone quite well on their own and it would only increase the enjoyment of these films to watch them all together.<br /><br />2046 isn't exactly science fiction, but rather more like a longing for another world in a science fiction landscape.  Tony Leung reprises his role as a writer in this movie and he uses the future in his writings to let his creativity to escape the comparatively dull life he leads.  Only his relationships with women takes him away from the humdrum realities of his day to day existence.<br /><br />That said, I recommend this movie and it's pretty cheap on Amazon.  Save the rest of your money to buy In the Mood for Love on Criterion Blu ray!<br /><br />Thanks.
B00AATV046|4.0|A thoroughly enjoyable movie. The humour was good. The Christmas message delivered by David Niven at the end showed a great message to all.

0316201561|5.0|This is the first novel from Chris Colfer. This is a great book that includes fantasy and reality intertwined. It is full of hope, bravery and love.<br /><br />The main issues in the book are about overcoming adversity and being able to cope with changes that come your way. Colfer is able to keep the book full of fun and adventure. The book is a classic good vs. evil story, but it has a good message in it. It teaches children to show empathy and compassion for everyone, even those who have done wrong.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for students in elementary grades 4 and 5.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|Amazing. One of my many johnny depp favorites. And tim burton worked wonders with his version of this movie. Over all it was prefect.

B0000AKCLS|5.0|Wow this is something completely new to me,it blew me away.<br />I had not heard Joe on his own before but I will be hearing a lot more of him in future.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|What I enjoyed most about the first two books in the series was definitely missing from this book.  This was a more &#34;informational&#34; type of a story.  You will definitely have a full understanding of the world of the Divergent Trilogy at the end of this book.  Relationships developed and we learned more about the people involved.<br /><br />Towards the end the excitement started to build again.  This was a more mature story than the other two, there were some emotional and philosophical insights shared.  I don't feel like Roth &#34;dumbed down&#34; the ending because of the age group this story is geared towards.  It was frank, and it was harsh.  It was life.<br /><br />I felt like it was a satisfying end to the trilogy.  You won't get that heart-pounding &#34;I can't put it down&#34; feeling.  I'm interested to see what Roth does next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Got it to try it out. This game is very well designed. Classic connect pieces type of fun, for those who like it.

B004G7UTXG|4.0|hard to believe how old it is, very good performances.  Story of regret and living up (or down) to what we are.  The spiritual tug of war is defined at many levels.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|I wish that I could say that I really liked this film, but I feel it was attempting to be something that it was not.<br />All film makers want to produce original stories that look and feel unique, but sometimes in their quest to look like nothing else, they become a parody of themselves. Adding crazy lighting effects to a bizarre and nonsensical air venting system (that was taken directly from Eon Flux)will not improve a scene. All the pointless art shots take away from the gravity of the plot.
B008V8FVTI|4.0|excellent cast with really good performances.  The feeling of justice out of control and twisted is entwined with the rationale the end justifies the means.  The only thing more gratifying would be instant Karma.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I've seen this movie so many times, I should have it all memorized. It's a bit greusome in parts, but it's an intentional part of the story-- not just bloody to be bloody.
B009V0TV6O|2.0|This is the free, not the paid, version, as we'd been told  we were being given. Its useless unless you've got the paid version, pretty much. Amazon, get your stuff together. FAOTD with malware, boring graphics, one star... now this? Tsk tsk..
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Beautiful story. Characters are interesting.  Story keeps you interested.<br />The ending is very wonderful & unexpected.  Another excellent  book of Nicholas Sparks

B008QLXSG8|4.0|It's short which is a good thing.<br />You can understand the main character but you can't relate to him. It is a privilege to get inside his mind.<br /><br />All in all it's a very good book. It has the occasional phrase that makes you put the book down and say: wow. How intense.<br /><br />The price is somewhat expensive.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Thought provoking. Two weeks after having read the book the characters are still with me. It feels as if I know them personally. Wonderful!!!!

B003G4W49C|5.0|Fast pace and keeps one's interest as reader identifies with main character.  Interesting concept of faster than light inter-galactic communications learned from the buggers. It's use in battle by both sides provides a surprising Link at end between the fantasy computer game that Ender is fixated with and how different species might communicate. Could not put it down until I finished it.
B003297I1U|5.0|Excellent buy both for the price and the durability.  My grandson continues to play with it everyday and it was one of the best toy purchases I have made.
B00CQZ65SI|4.0|I'm a big fan of Novak Djokovic, so I purchased \\"Serve to Win\\" to learn more about his life.  In that respect, the book is a bit of a let-down, given that it is not a traditional sports autobiography and focuses more on his recent diet changes and resulting tennis success.  Novak does share some stories about his life, including a few passages about growing up in war-torn Serbia.  At night, his family would hide in a bomb shelter, and in the day, he would practice tennis.  He's lead an extraordinary life, which is probably part of the reason that he is so popular in Serbia today.<br /><br />However, the book spends most of its time discuss his health issues over the years, particularly the various breathing and fitness concerns that plagued his early career.  These problems climaxed during a long five-set match at the Australian Open in 2010 against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.  Toward the end of that match, Djokovic crashed - he ran out of energy and lost the final two sets quickly.  He talks about how frustrating it was to train so much and still have so little gas left in the tank at the end of long matches.  The match happened to be watched by a Serbian nutritionist, who suggested that Novak be tested for allergies, especially gluten.  Fast forward a year, and Novak is experiencing an incredible winning streak - winning three majors and finishing 2012 as the #1 player.<br /><br />Djokovic's gluten-free diet is explained in detail.  I don't plan on using this diet, but I do appreciate the balanced tone he takes in discussing it.  He doesn't claim that it's for everyone or that it's a miracle diet.  He simply sets forth what it did for him and how he follows it.  Novak even cites research on its effectiveness, while maintaining that he's not a medical expert and so forth.  The book includes a section detailing what Novak eats during a typical day along with recipes; I like that he breaks it down into his four rules for eating, which could be simple for many people to follow.  If one wants to start a gluten-free diet, then this book could be a good initial guide.<br /><br />So how about the tennis fans?  Will they enjoy this book?  I did overall, even though I kept hoping for more behind-the-scenes information.  He mentions matches only in passing and mostly to illustrate his poor conditioning before his diet or his improved fitness after going gluten-free.  Not much dishing here, although he does note his anger when Andy Roddick famously questioned his health issues (Andy recently gave a more explicit version of the story whereby he and Novak almost came to blows in the locker room).  Ultimately, though, Novak has perhaps become too statesmen like, too sporting, to give us an insider's view of his life.  In the meantime, \\"Serve to Win\\" will do.w.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I didn't hate this book as much as a lot of people seem to express in their reviews, but as someone who absolutely LOVED the first two novels in this series, I was extremely disappointed. I think that the ideas in Allegiant were solid and could have been amazing, but I think that the whole thing felt a little rushed and perhaps too large of an undertaking for 1 novel, with trying to split the novel into two different points of view as well as introducing the whole world outside of the city and...<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />....trying to introduce the whole idea of genetic damage etc. I think that the idea was extremely interesting but I don't feel that Roth managed to pull it off. Unlike other people, while I was sad to see a certain character die in the end, I didn't have the same issue with that aspect of the story as others did.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this novel was that there was no discernible difference between the two POV offered in the novel. I always saw Tris and Tobias as very different characters and that was part of what was so interesting in seeing them struggle to make a relationship work, so the fact that the two characters seemed almost the same in this novel was totally off to me and generally a huge disappointment -  I think that Roth is a very talented writer and I am a huge fan of the first two books but this book did not do her series or her writing abilities justice and I would not recommend this particular novel in the series to others.

It's not the readers book, it's the authors book.<br />Although the book was tragic, it was beautiful.<br />Veronica Roth kept with the personalities of the characters, which is why the book ended the way it did.<br />The book captured the characters strengths, flaws, & of course, bravery. It taught me a lot about love, standing up for what you believe in & what's right, about family, commitment, grief, & staying true to yourself, no matter what anyone says about you.<br />This book was absolutely amazing, & although it broke my heart, it was one of the best books I have ever read. Veronica Roth is a truly talented woman & I am so thankful to have had the experience of reading this powerful trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great, strategy game with fun graphics. It rarely freezes or gives me issues when playing. I love trying to catch up to my friends or brag to those who are way behind.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|I like the plotline - I mean, who hasn't been irritated by having their time wasted?  I have to agree with so many others on the fact that the style of writing is very juvenile.  It read just like a 6th grade book report.  I'm really surprised it's rated so highly.  You should definitely get the preview before you decide to buy it.
B00FPGV3RS|1.0|Love the cast,  hate the movie.  What a waste but on the plus side, this will hopefully keep me from ever buying another instant video version of an unseen movie.  It was juvenile and boring.  The CGI was way over the top, the plot was lame and the characters were contrived and silly.  How can you put Bacon, Parker, Bridges and Reynolds together and come up with this trash?  My next stop after writing this review will involve a trip to IMDB.  I want to make sure I never waste my time with another movie written or directed by the people that brought us this one.  Do yourself a favor and  ignore the 4 and 5 star reviews - I sure wish I had.  This is probably a 2 star movie but I'm subtracting another star because they wasted such a potentially fun cast.  I'm not a film critic,  I'm not even a very critical person.  I watch movies purely for the entertainment value but I found little of that in this flick.  If you absolutely have to see this movie,  make sure it's a rental and not a purchase.  Also,  if you invent a time machine,  please get to me about 3 hours before this review and keep me from throwing away 15 bucks.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|The zipper quit working on our sleeve , purchased this in August. I sent an Email to Amazon and two days later their was a new one in my mail box !! Wow , great service !!! Love the kindle fire !!! Thanks!!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Contains spoilers**<br /><br />The beginning of this book bored me nearly to tears. I had to continue because it's a trilogy, and you have to see it through at this point. If it were the first book, I wouldn't have completed it to the end.<br /><br />After I read about 80%, I felt Tris was acting without thinking things through. She chose a side by her emotions, wanting to fight those that were responsible for her parents death, and not by considering whether it was the right side. A person shouldn't fight, or start a revolution out of revenge.<br /><br />I'm not bummed Tris died. It's a story, and I accept death, even imaginary characters. What I'm bummed about is that there was a 'meeting' between Evelyn and Marcus and there's suddenly peace in Chicago. Two armies at odds won't easily put down their weapons, especially those trained as dauntless.<br /><br />The ending after Tris died felt rushed. Hurry up and show the world is better because of Tris' death. I guess it was written that way because this was Tris' story, and thus dead, the story should end, but Veronica had to continue to give her death meaning.<br /><br />I was a Four fan, but I am not any more. Uriah died because of his actions. Period. There was no way to blame Nita. She couldn't have done what she did without his actions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addicting. The only downfall is that when you get to certain levels, you have to have friends unlock them for you. I hate waiting!!
B005LAIIGW|5.0|This is one of those films that demands, has to be, on Imax screen in 3D. If you interested in it, see it that way. Any TV screen at home is just going to be too small for this visual treat. Pure action movie. Recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is one of the best games of all time on a tablet.  It's so gun but I hate that I have to wait for lives.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of his best books. I highly recommend it. Read this book if you are a Stephen King fan. Can not wait to see what he does next.
1576754227|5.0|AWESOME BOOK - I highly recommend it.  We read this book for my team at work for a quarterly goal, so I wasn't thrilled to be forced to read it after first.  But after just a couple of pages, I couldn't put it away.  I started taking notes, writing down ideas, and having fun with it, and I actually got quite alot out of it.  The author writes so smoothly and puts things into an easy to understand, real-life perspective, and he doesn't do it in a &#34;preachy&#34; way.  I have learned a lot about how I think, and what can help me to make big tasks seem small and easy to conquer.  I have learned some GREAT tips that I still use every day in my work planning as well as personal life tasks and projects.
0399159347|4.0|I got this book for my book club and I wasn't too excited for it because the cover is a little too 'chic lit' for me - I thought it might be almost a romance novel since I didn't know much about it.  It turned out to be an excellent book - I couldn't put it down!  The ending was controversial; I loved it some people didn't like the ending at all, but even still, they still enjoyed the book overall.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I loved pinball as a kid, so I thought worth a try...and i like this game even though it's only electronic.  It's fun and relaxing, and it works surprisingly well with the touch screen most of the time.  I like the sounds of the game.  I like that it has 4 different designs to play - Wild West and Underwater are my favorites.  Recommended game
B00124PXW8|3.0|It's a classic, so I wanted to have seen it, but it's good by old cinema standards and I found it cheesy.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|1927 was an unusual year with many notable events occuring. I particularly liked the way Bryson arranged it so we know what is going on in several areas the same time. I bought the book because I have read Bryson's work before and because 1927 was my birth year and I was not disappointed - It was wonderful.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|There is not a song on this album that I don't like. I love Lorde and I love Pure Heroine.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The story completely transported me to this time and place. The customs, the sets, acting were beautiful and believable.  This period in history was wretched and horrifying.  Yet romantic and complicated.  I'm glad I didn't live during King Henry the VIII's rule.  After finishing season 1, I immediately started season 2.
006202406X|1.0|I have never even written a review before. I was so dissatisfied with this book. I wanted to make sure it got the 1 star. It wasn't even so much the ending. But all the problems, character's story arcs, etc that just seemed to never be resolved. I wish people would stop writing trilogies because I've realized by the 3rd book, it gets sloppy.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|lots of fun for the whole family to play and challenge each other.Nice to keep busy student occupy.Can become very addictive.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is amazing. Better than the show by far. A lot more detail is delivered in the book than the series. I do admit, however, that having seen the show I was better able to handle all the characters in the book (there are many). This book has suspense like no other and the magic and emotion and the honor of knights and pretty much anything you could ask for in a book of kings and lords and knights and magic! I love Daenerys!!!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I had to delete all my apps and it still needed application space very unhappy about it. it is an awesome game but not if u have to delete all of your apps.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall  is great, the story line is great and the song is out there.. love everything  about it .. Sorry I never like the other Bond , he was better as Simon Templar the Saint.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's awesome and its worth free well it would be worth 1568 and be worth it! every kid should get this game because it's awesome and fun.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|fun. addicting. lots of fun. my kids love it. its a game ttat takes time and need real friends. my kids help each other out
B004KZOXJA|4.0|I havent even finished this book and I already love it seriously amazing I love these sort of books where there is a sort of ruling party that isnt always right
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great conclusion to a wonderful trilogy!!! This book like the others kept me on the edge of my seat! I could not put it down!! Love this story and love these characters. Just so sad that it's over :( Read it!! You will not be disappointed :) :)
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|this book is my absolute favorite it is a classic thats not really heard about much but you cant help but fall in love with the characters even relate to some of them
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|It plays fine but there will be little blips on the worsen every now and then. would have given five stars.
B0064HJX56|3.0|unfortuantly it wasnt as good as matched but still kept me reading though I'm glad it wasnt to dragged out as it could of been
052118939X|4.0|A good grammar with great exercises. Well illustrated and with great explanations. I liked this product. And is available in the mobile version.
B00000IZOR|1.0|looks better in picture. I was disappointment when I got it. the string is not long enough. Rating 1 star..on a 1-5 scale..
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The swivel mechanism/clamp is very strong and should last. The leg extensions rely on friction to stay extended..There is no way to compensate for a loss of friction. They won't last. The phone holder is plastic. It is sturdy and nice looking. It doesn't inspire confidence when gripping my LG Optimus phone.It will not hold a phone with the lens holding bracket attached.The lens and my phone both way 4 oz.The tripod is almost to small.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Not just an awesome horror film. This always just pulls me in, one of my favorite movies. An adaptation of a Swedish novel & film, Matt Reeves & his cast did a great job with this. The leads are amazing. You find yourself rooting for them, even though they're headed down a very dark road. That's how good the story is. Yes it's a vampire movie but it's really so much more. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|In most ways, Iron Man 3 was up to par.  A bucket full of CGI lunacy, action and nonsense for a classic super hero block buster.... with exactly one glaring omission that people can not see:  No Music.  Score equals Zero.<br /><br />The movie proper had no musical accompaniment.  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  There was music in the opening credits before the movie starts, and a bit of sound track AFTER the climax of the film in the wrap up, and NOTHING in between.  The music and Robert Downy were the defining two elements of Iron Man 1 that made the thing work.  Number 3 only managed half.<br /><br />Quiz: What do Iron Man 1 and Pacific Rim have in common?  A Ramin Djawadi musical score and mostly positive reviews.<br /><br />Go watch Fifth Element and listen.  The Fifth Element CD sound track sucked as there is no full song or score per se, but Fifth Element uses musical sound to define and frame every scene.  Movie Audio Awesome (by Eric Serra).  Iron Man 3?  Visually fine, audible... out to lunch with nobody home.  Whoever heard of a Hollywood movie climax without climactic music?  Really?!<br /><br />Shane Black better clean the wax out of his ears and remember that Hollywood movies are supposed to have a sound track.  How did everyone making, watching, and reviewing Iron Man 3 not notice?<br /><br />Why didn't any of the \\"most helpful\\" reviews notice?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm sooooo happy that Candy Crush Saga is FINALLY available on Amazon!!!  This game is so addictive but I love it and now I don't always have to be on my PC or my phone, I can finally play it on my Kindle Fire...yay!!!<br />Thank you Amazon!!
0525478817|3.0|This book is YA, but not Twilight-YA. I honestly didn't feel like I was reading a book that I'm too old to be reading. Sure, it's a book who's main characters are 16 years old, but it didn't feel juvenile or immature. In fact, it felt quite the opposite as it centers around a pretty heavy issue, cancer, & child cancer at that.<br /><br />The protagonist, Hazel, is 16 & has terminal cancer. She meets & falls in love with Augustus, who lost his leg to cancer, but is currently in remission. I really liked both of these characters. They're kindred spirits & it's simultaneously refreshing & heartbreaking to watch their relationship develop.<br /><br />Green tackles some big issues, like cancer, obviously, but also life, love & death. The book is for ages 14 & up, but this 36 year old thoroughly enjoyed it. In the few days since I've finished it, I've found myself thinking about Hazel & Augustus a lot & wishing their story continued.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Many different levels and challenges keep you engaged and interested in the game. Some levels you could be stuck on for weeks or months. Bit when you best it sweet victory is yours!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Ugh, this book. If this book had been a living, breathing person, when I finished it, I would have punched it in the face. I can't remember the last time a book made me this mad. In fairness, I was warned. The book is great. I literally could not put it down. And then I got to the end. This was the first book I read on my iPad & when I got to the last page, I was convinced that there was a glitch in iBooks & that there were pages not showing up. I even had my husband look at it to see if something was wrong. Nope. It's just the worst book ending IN THE WORLD. You've been warned.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Waited a long time for Candy Crush on Kindle Fire! Glad it's up with no glitches so far! Colors are a little different than on FB, but not a big deal.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|Meh. I'm glad I read this because I like to know what people are talking about when they're talking about it. And there were definitely parts that resonated with me & made me laugh. But still, meh.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|World war two was when technology and war really met. This game gives people to see what world war two weapons were like.
1250012570|5.0|I LOVED this book! It's a story about young love with the added bonus of eighties music & family dysfunction. Reading this really took me back to the angst of being a teenager. It starts out fairly light, but ends with some pretty serious stuff. It's also one of those books with short chapters that alternates between characters, so you read it quickly. I loved it & highly recommend it.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|This cooler took my i7 3770k from 40c or so with the stock cooler down to a chilly 30 or so when not maxed out. Very good cooler and it can fit a wide variety of cpu sockets which is a nice feature. Thought do watch out the thing is massive and you need to make sure your ram heatfins or anything else won't get in the way of this behemoth.<br />Overall I'm giving this a 4/5 because the build quality is good, the cooling is excellent and I love mine.<br />Honestly though you should just go get the evo 212 plus. It's a better cooler and addresses the issue of the spacing between the copper pipes. I bought this one because I was on sale for $15 and I don't need anything better.
0316056871|5.0|Why did I wait so long to read this book?! Gah, this book completes me. Surely everyone else has read it by now, but if not, read it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book had me in tears. I could not put it down. Tobias' and Tris' relationship shines stronger than ever before. Really liked it.
0316228532|3.0|Aside from Ann Patchett, no one seems to like this book. But I liked it. In full disclosure, I wanted to like it. I tend to like the books Ann Patchett recommends; I also love J.K. Rowling. I think Rowling is a great storyteller & develops characters like no other author I've read. I wouldn't go so far as to say I loved it, or that it made me cry, but I liked it & I'm glad I read it. It's a long, winding story with a town full of characters, none of them the protagonist & not a lot happens until the last few pages. It's a beautiful, well written book that I will probably never read again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted to the solving problems. Just like everyone else playing. Competiton with my friends.  Can't wait to get more lives.
0062023063|3.0|This book has been recommended to me about a million times & I've always dismissed it. Every time someone recommends it, they give the disclaimer: it's written by a dog & the dog dies. Why would I read this book?! But I read it & it really is good. It's more heartwarming than sad. Reading a book written through the perspective of a dog isn't as weird as you think. Give it a shot, especially if you're a dog lover.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes to play video games and to have fun.
1781162646|4.0|This is a weird, little book, but I really liked it. Typical Stephen King, it's a slow build, but it goes out with a bang. And unlike most of his books, this one is super short, so you get to the action pretty fast. After I finished it, I found myself missing the characters, which is usually indicative of a good book. I recommend it!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love and absolutely hate this book at the same time, really why Tris, why I literally cried when she died WHY!!!!!!! She shouldn't of died, she was to heroic, Tobias would of been ok, but I now hate you for killing Tris, and you were my favorite write author!!!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book I had a difficult time putting it down. i read it on my lunch breaks while i waited at the bus stop and every other chance i had. it was an awesome extension to the shining! can't wait for the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a great game fun addictive,  very addictive I'm up at 1:33 am playing it right now we need more games like this one!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Another great book from Jo Nesbo.  His plots are intricate and fascinating.  I could hardly put this book down.  I look forward to more books from Nesbo.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Happy to get to know Dan Torrence again after all these years. Kept me totally engrossed in Dan's life after the Overlook
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Another excellent book by Jo Nesbo.  He has such a vivid imagination, and Harry Hole is one of the most fascinating characters I've read about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game deserves 5 stars I like the music that come with it. It puts you in a relaxing mode to concentrate on matching 3 or more candies and what happens when you do. Sometimes I don't like sometimes when im stuck and needs help from friends to play again. The game is totally awesome, the bell, whistles and different candies that whip a  whole line of candies and more candies drop and clear more lines and your score gets higher and higher. OMG and the different challenges clear all the jelly, bring down all the ingredients, or all the fruit I just love. 5 stars all the way. I highly recommend this game to everyone of all ages.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I really liked this film; The critics have said there was nothing new and that it had all been done before one way or another....which may be true but the quality of the production; the timing of the disclosers; the movement of the film; the soundtrack the visuals and the ability of the actors to bring out emotional reaction with very little dialog involved...was superb...The timing in the film is excellent and comes across smooth as glass...which is enhanced by the visuals and music. The one part in the film that I thought production timing broke down was where Jack and Julia were at the cabin and A Whiter Shade of Pale starts playing in the background...I thought that Julia should have looked a little more sheepish and guilty and Jack a little more regretful and insecure but otherwise I thought it was a good choice of music and songs. This movie should be used in Film class to show how Visuals; Music and timing can enhance an otherwise mediocre script for a movie and make it come out great and spectacular..Also I was very impressed with most of the acting involved particularly Andrea Risenbough who I thought played her character to a tee...You really need to see this movie in Blu Ray with a high quality surround system and as large a screen as possible to experience this movie as its meant to be seen..watching this movie on your I-phone is just not going to give you the experience that you need in order to evaluate this movie correctly....if the critics had loved this movie and given it praise I might have only given it a four start or three star rating; but because The critics had given it such a low rating I was shocked when I finally saw the film and was drawn in...I had to get this movie hence this review on the Blu Ray....
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|Movie is good and could be watched once.. for a couple of reasons...<br />1. Christian Bale<br />2. Action and fight scenes atleast the last ones<br /><br />If you are a SCI-FI lover then this movie is for you..
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|This Anker battery is small enough to put in my pocket along with my Galaxy S3 [I have big pockets.], while strong enough to give my S3 two full charges with lots of juice left over even after the second charge.  Full charge in about two hours.  Just what I needed.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is one of my ultimate favorite movies ever. Even though some of the lines are a bit cheesy and over the top, I love it all the same!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an amazing app ;) it's a game about survival, and building. Minecraft has no specific goals though so possibilities are endless.<br />  There are two modes on minecraft. Creative and survival. On creative you have all the blocks on minecraft pe. You can build whatever you want. You also have spawn eggs which allow you to spawn in animals which currently include cows pigs chickens and sheep. On creative mode you can also fly.<br />  On survival you start off with nothing. You need to figure out a way to survive the nights because monsters will come out at night and will cause you to die. ( you can turn off the monsters by playing on peaceful mode which can be turned on in options.) The monsters include...<br />Zombies<br />Skeletons that shoot arrows at you.<br />Spiders which are hostile at night and jump at you. In the morning though, they won't hurt you.<br />And creepers which are green monsters that creep up close to you and explode. ( these can really startle you. )<br />To survive the nights you will need wood. You can get wood by punching trees. With wood you can craft wooden plAnks. Wooden plAnks can be used to build shelters with. They can also make crafting tables which are used to make other cool blocks and items as long as you have the needed resources. Once you survive your first nights you can go mining. When mining you can find lots of neat ores like...<br />Coal which is used for cooking and smelting things in the furnace<br />Iron ore which is used for making iron weapons and armour.<br />Gold which is used for making armour and weapons<br />Lapis lazuli which is a dye used to color wool.<br />Redstone which does not yet have a purpose for pe version yet<br />And diamond the rarest material on minecraft used for making the best armour and weapons.<br />I am not going to go into all the possibilities of this app but there are many many more. I recommend this app to everyone!! It is worth the price!!!<br />My only cons of this app are that...<br />The price is a bit high.<br />When bugs get fixed there are new bugs<br />Hope this review helped :) -izzy
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Just started watching this show when I got Amazon prime.Love the show and love streaming.Thank You Amazon Prime and keep coming up with TV shows from the past.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Scribblenauts is an app about using your creativity to solve problems. For example<br />Your goal is to cut down the tree. You could use a saw or you could use a......... giant rainbow flying powerful kind saw. The possibilities are endless on scribblings. There is also a sandbox mode where you can create anything that you can think of. (That is my favorite part of scribblenauts.)<br />The only con of this app is that you have to pay for updates. I have finished all of the levels all ready so now I am kind of bored of it. I already played two dollars for the app. Why do I have to pay more for the updates?!!!! This is the only thing keeping my rating from being five stars. Over all though I recommend this app. But if you want more levels, you have to pay. :( -izzy
B0043D2FB2|1.0|very dry and clinical.  Not an enjoyable read.  I find myself skimming to get through it...  highly recommend you don't waste the money.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|This game is a great little strategy game set in space that also has some cool mini-game and rpg elements.  The first run through on easy is basically a tutorial that lasts for a few hours.  After you win, it lets you choose your same crew and ship and let you play again on a harder level.  That's when the game truly starts.  The gameplay is broken up into minigames for firing your weapons, running your troops and engineers around RTS-style for ship repairs and fights when other crews board your ship, and inventory  management to upgrade your rooms to they operate with special abilities.  The full game was only about three hours for me, but the game was meant for replaying it in harder modes and experimenting with different strategies and rooms.  It's a very satisfying game for people who enjoy space sim or RTS with RPG elements.
006202406X|4.0|I blew through the first two books in this series in two days back in June.  On the third day, I pre-ordered the third book, anxiously waiting for my questions to be answered, like everyone else who had been with Tris and Four throughout the whole ordeal.<br /><br />I got the book (in hard copy, not on Kindle only because the other two I had were in hard copy too and I have a thing about owning a series all in one format or another).  I sat down and read it in one day (big surprise).<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />First, it was as I had predicted to my husband.  There was a government lab/experiment similar to the Village (a horrible movie by M. Night Shamalamadingdong - don't waste your life watching it).  There was more to the factions than we originally knew.  There were horrible injustices being done to innocent people in the name of pure genetic makeups.<br /><br />I suppose that I should not be surprised that it came down to genetic engineering, something that people are always wondering about.  To that end, seeing how it still gives people a sense of superiority over each other, another way to divide society, it was disappointing to know that, at least in this future, we will not reach a place where we finally acknowledge each other as equals (you know, like they do in Star Trek).<br /><br />Now, the ending couldn't have happened any other way.  If there had been a HEA then it would have been too mushy and too predictable.  Did I want there to be a HEA for both of them?  Yes.  They both had a very sad existence, hard lives, hard initiations, had people close to them die.  Didn't they deserve to be a little happy?  Didn't they deserve just a few days to really enjoy being with each other?  They never got that opportunity.  But in the end, it was the only way.  She was the only way.  The upsetting thing though, through it all, is that I got the sense that the government did not stop doing what they were doing.  They may have disbanded the Chicago experiment, but I don't think that stopped everything altogether.  In a way, it felt like she died in vain and that really upset me I think.  Knowing that she could have been happy.  She could have helped people more.<br /><br />Does her death make me hate the book?  No.  Does it make me question if I would have read the whole series and allowed my nerdy self to get attached to the characters as much as i did.  Yes.  I hate crying over a book!  And I cried, cried like a baby.ing altogether.  In a way, it felt like she died in vain and that really upset me I think.  Knowing that she could have been happy.  She could have helped people more.

B003VANOFY|3.0|I have been using this pair of headsets for 6 months on and off, and I unfortunately have to be a little bit critical of this product. I actually purchased this item so cost was an issue, and managed to get one on sale with rewards from Staples. What I was looking for was a headset (mic and headphones) and wireless capability for Skype, Dragon Speech Recognition, TF2, and everyday use 10+ hours at the computer per day. Of all those on the market, it seemed that the g930 was the best reviewed and a hot for gamers.<br /><br />What I really did enjoy was that it features quite comfortable pads great for hours of use. The foam cups envelope your ear and provide some noise isolation. The USB of course bypasses any sound card and is plug and play on most PCs.<br /><br />Here is where I have to include some negative sticking points not addressed in many of the positive cursory reviews here. If you are using this product like I am in front of the computer for work 8 hrs+ or at home and at work for multiple hours, the wireless feature is effectively useless. Because the battery dies with normal usage after 8-9 hrs and even quicker if you are on a movie/gaming binge. So effectively it's always plugged in or else it runs out of charge and keeping it charged has to be on your mind vs. corded headphones. Moreover, the plug is a micro USB (cellphone sized) and it's not easy to plug it in while wearing it. I'd rather not think about it. The benefit, however, you can keep it on when going to the bathroom or kitchen and the signal still stays strong.<br /><br />This leads to the next super annoying problem. This is the most serious issue I have with the product. The headset goes to sleep mode after 10 minutes of no audio and it's not easy to turn it back on. There's have been countless instances when I have missed Skype phone calls because the unit already turn itself off and I didn't hear the ring even though I was wearing it. It's also frustrating when you want to take a Youtube break and suddenly you realize you have no sound. This wouldn't be so bad if the switch to wake it up was a flip switch or a button you did not have to hold for a certain number of seconds. Here I am a little confused as it sometimes has odd wakeup requirements. To turn the unit on, you have to press and hold the on button for 5 full seconds. But there have been many occasions when the LED light near the charging socket was on, but the unit was off. During those times, I have to hold the ON button 15+ seconds to wake it up. Then there are the times when you don't know if the unit is uncharged or if the ON button wants to be pressed for 15+ seconds.<br /><br />There was a period when I simply went back to my Sennheisers, but was forced back because these are only way to Skype.<br /><br />The last criticism, is that the software uses CPU quite extensively especially for older computers. I'm running this on a Core 2 Duo laptop, and TF2 went from playable on low to unplayable at all.<br /><br />So at the end of the day, I am still using it. But if I had to buy it again, I wouldn't. I would have gotten a AKG and a dedicated mic for any Skype/Dragon.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I think the book would be more honest if it were titled something like: &#34;Evidence of a Spiritual Dimension.&#34; That's all he discovered so far - the existence of a spiritual dimension. For the Christian, there is no heaven without Jesus, and Jesus is conspicuously absent in this book. I hope for Dr. Alexander's sake - and for those of his readers who are still searching - that he'll continue to search for the truth until he has found Jesus, who is the only way to heaven.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Motorhead have made a comeback since Inferno...love the fact that there are 14 songs on this album; every song one sounds different. My favorite songs being Knife and End of Time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|cant stop playing. i come back every 30 minutes for the next challenge. every level is more of a challenge
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|There is nothing quite like robots effin each other up. That's what is awesome about this game, digital renderings of robots effin each other up. Great game!
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Starts very slow and at times hard to get into it but midway through you will find you can't put it down. Don't give up on this book. It really is worth reading.
0385350864|3.0|Somehow being 50'ish is just not as funny or as hopeful as being 30'ish.  Helen Fielding has brought the story forward, and Bridget is now a widow with two small children, looking for love after Mark Darcy's death overseas while fighting injustice.  I think it was clever of Fielding to kill off Mark Darcy, because that's the only way you get back the Bridget you know and love at all.  But what made the original books better is that being self-absorbed is funny when you're only responsible for yourself, but less funny when you are supposed to be raising two small children.  Hasn't she grown at all in the intervening two decades?  Didn't the love of a good man, enjoyed for almost the same length of time, give her more confidence in herself?  She's running out of time to get it right.  Bridget's voice is the same - original, unique, and very much her own - and captured in the same diary-like entries as before.  But I found her somewhat tiresome, and while intermittently amused, still found myself saying \\"Grow up, Bridget.  Other people are counting on you....\\"
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|This is a wonderful love story. Despite what life puts in their way, this couple ignites the flame. Ryan Gosling is always a treat to watch. He portrays his character. In such a real way and so true to life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Trust me ladies, your man will love it if you read this book because you won't be able to keep your hands off of him!!  This book is hott!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|always something new and challenging. only game I have played for months and have never got tired of.. friendly competition.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved fifty shades, fifty shades darker was even better because the story evolves beyond the sex and delves into why &#34;fifty&#34; is the way he is, more of a love story than erotica!
B0091REZMW|2.0|The game has some interesting puzzles and features but requires you to buy pieces thAt you need to continue playing.  I refuse to pay money for these apps.<br /> Cc
B003NS2T9G|4.0|Keep following the adventures of Captian Jack and his team. In this great spin off series from dr who and the bbc.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I bought these for my grandson for his birthday.  He is reading the Potter books now.  By buying the complete set, the movie is always available for him to watch after he finishes each book.  He is 10 years old and is going as Harry Potter for Halloween.  Amazon had the best price for the complete set.  I had tried to buy them individually, but they were not always available like that in stores so when I found this set on Amazon and at the price they had the set for, I couldn't pass it up.  Amazon always comes through.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is great. You get to draw whatever you want and nobody can judge you. If there were 15 stars I would give them all to this game.
0385537131|2.0|with a great \\"opening\\" and much promise the book becomes muddled and far to complex about a third in.  It was hard to wade through to the cliche ending.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Intelligently written.  Good insight into man's psyche.  Well developed plot.  Makes you aware of your own conscience and approach to life.  Honesty, truth, integrity...is what matters in an individual's life (and a sense of humor to connect with others).  It's a book you will long remember because it becomes part of you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love to play when I want to &quot;escape&quot; for a few minutes! Fun game and cute graphics! Glad they finally got it for kindle!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game. Everyone should try it. That's it all I have say. Try it if u like puzzles.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|It was a very good movie. Lots of action and drama. maybe a little more action would have made it a better movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game. Connects easily to facebook, I have not had any problems with it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I stop to play this game and am enjoying it a lot. It gets harder the further you go into the game but it makes you think and is<br />FUN AT THE SAME TIME  So far its easier than the facebook version.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great fun for everyone including children. Much enjoyed by the whole family. We all play together to see who can do the best and compare at the end of each game
B0016J81CI|5.0|I stand in a laboratory for most of the day at work. These are the only shoes where my feet don't ache at the end of the day. I've tried Dansco's, New Balance, and other miscellaneous shoes. These are the best for me and relatively inexpensive too.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This Disney cartoon is one of the best modern Dsney feature cartoons released for many years..  It is a delight to watch from start to finish.  The songs are a joy to see performed and the plot is excellant.  Of course, the animation is state of the art.  Childern will love this and adults will be glad they watched it too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Not boring but I must go to sleep. Works well. Sound gets repetitive but a good tune. You&acute;ll spend  hours of fun saying &quot;The next level will be my last&quot;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very excited that candy crush is back on Kindle Fire. I originally bought this kindle for netflix and books this is truly a pleasant bonus!!!!
B002GYI9C4|3.0|He has great ideas. He creates interesting characters.  But his average writing makes reading his books a big of a slog for me.  He repeats obvious themes over and over and over. Yes, I get that the girl in this story has trust issues.  I got that on page 5.  i didn't have to read it on practically every page for the rest of the book.  Such repetitions became annoying, and actually detracted from my enjoyment of the book.  Perhaps it was intended for a younger audience, who needed that kind of constant repeating?<br /><br />It was disappointing.  I don't know if I'll read the rest of them.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|gorgeous. heartbreaking. bleak. very , very beautiful. a film without hope. a film with perhaps hope. a throbbing. a certain pulsing. fassbender is remarkable. mulligan is remarkable.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A friend who edits books for a living recommended this one as a quick, fun read.  I was looking for something light, and this fit the bill.  The story of Allan, told as parallell narratives of his flight from the Old Folks Home in the modern day and his life history woven throughout the book, is fun, witty, under-stated, and the perfect fit for what I was looking for.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Punchy, clever, smart, witty, sharp, wonderful cast, strong writing, it just keeps getting better. Try it, you'll like it. I promise.
014241493X|4.0|Do yourself a favor and just read John Green's books.  He does teen angst with a rare eye for the real and a kind heart that avoids sappy melodrama.  He finds humor in even tragedy, and his protagonists have wry, smart, funny voices that pull you in and make you hope for them to succeed.<br />In Paper Towns, the plot similarities to Looking for Alaska and some of his others (a beautiful and mysterious girl who leaves), but his writing is so much fun and so wise, I didn't even mind it.<br />Just read the book.  It's JOHN GREEN, for heaven sake!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great cast, teriffic writing, wonderful art direction and damn good fun. Looking forward to the next installment. Try it, you won't be sorry if you like good TV.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I find the story line of Downton Abbey to be so relatable to our lives.  There are multiple classes that each if us play a role, and all are needed to make the world go round.  This show is captivating to everyone who takes more that 10 minutes to get to know the richly developed characters.  I must see!
B00DJZR46G|4.0|Not their best, I didn't care much for TBone's producing - BUT that said, it is deep and meaningful stuff - no fluff on this disc. Elton and Bernie are the best of their generation, and they still have what it takes to give good music.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it and are going to buy another one. Works great with netflix and turns your phone into a movie remote.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I love every song on this new record. the listener can see how Katy has grown as a person and artist. The main themes of the album are love light and happiness none of the songs this time are overall raunchy and teenie bopper; there are three songs that come close though &#34;Birthday,&#34; &#34;Dark Horse&#34; and This Is How We Do&#34; are very carefree and sexy but do not cross the line. With songs like &#34;This Moment&#34;  By The Grace Of God and &#34;Unconditionally&#34;  Katy addresses universal themes o f  love and living life to the fullest. The mainstream hit &#34;Roar&#34; along with &#34;Love Me&#34; are empowering athems. In &#34;It Takes Two&#34; and Ghost Katy emphasizes the importance of honoring realtionships and past lovers. Katy also incorporates new sounds into this album with a Bollywood indian vibe in &#34;Legendary Lovers&#34; and  what sounds like a Gospel Choir in &#34;Walking On Air.&#34; Overall this album beams out light and color like the prismatic experience it is.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Loved the aggressive approach to a belief I've had since the late 60's.  Pam Grout writes as though I'm talking to my best friend.<br /><br />I love the easy read style. This is a book that you only have to read once to \\"get it\\" and actually put it in immediate practice<br />..
0547978847|5.0|Great book. Passing the beautiful ideas on to my newborn. Just great read. The little prince is a beautiful book
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great app for the money. Really liked the story and gameplay. So much better than all the find stuff games I've played in the past.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read it when it first came out, several times after. Reread now to re acquaint  myself with it before the movie. Read all the  hate for the author over his anti-gay stance, regardless of his sexual bigotry the main themes of the story resonate strongly. Admire the painting not the artist, I would compare this story to Jules Verne  and 20,000 leagues under the sea, the idea of tablet desktops, internet are just as foreward looking. This book came out in 1988, 25 years ago the internet didn't exist personal computers didn't exist word processors were cutting edge at the time, in 1993 I lugged a word processor to Switzerland my senior year of college that weighed more than my largest computer/printer combo I use now and all 30 other students had to use it since it was cutting edge , I can remember when the internet was nothing but text 90% .edu. Regardless of the authors religious upbringing this is an american icon to be compared to the greats.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Having a blast working my way through the levels.  Having to wait for new lives is frustrating, but it's good to delay gratification, right?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fun read  Good mind bender with history woven throughout.  King is one of my favorite authors. Enjoy five stars  Thanks
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Every phone I buy I always install SwiftKey. I haven't found a better keyboard yet. It's simply the best all around keyboard.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I bought this for my grandson who does not particularly enjoy reading but he loves this book. His sixth grade class is using it for a class project.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I enjoy puzzles and this game satisfies that. You're trying to occupy the most spaces on the board against three computer players using tetris-shaped pieces to snatch up places while blocking the others. The difficulty-level can be adjusted and different strategy ploys can be used to try and come out on top.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|It will make you think.  It let you imagine. It will keep you entertained.<br />It is so much better than 'reality' television!!!
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|We watched this on movie night with my husband, sisters, brother in law.  Every one enjoyed the movie and the 3D effects.  My husband isn't a big action jaction movie lover, this was a great action si fi movie.  Good story line, acting was great, and everyone enjoyed the movie. I am so glad I bought this movie in 3D!  Well worth the money.  Arrived on release date with Prime.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|This sequel to &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; picks up nine years after the two lead characters, Jesse and Celine, have had their romantic encounter and gone separate ways.  Now, Jesse has written a best selling book about their encounter and is promoting his book at a Parisian bookstore when who should he see out of the corner of his eye?  You guessed it -- Celine is back.  Richard Linklater does an amazing job creating a riveting story out of dialogue between just two characters.  That's right, no crashes, no car chases, explosions, bullets flying, aliens landing -- just two people having a conversation, curious and interested in each other, realizing what their lives have been and wondering where they might be going.  The dialogue, written by Linklater and co-star Julie Delpy, is rich with insight, depth, compassion, wit and sensitivity.  The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is fascinating enough to keep even the most jittery action movie junkies riveted.
B0090SI460|5.0|I got this previously viewed because I wanted it in 3D.  I liked the 3D, but glad I didn't pay new price.  The set was perfect, only missing the digital copy, but that was expected with previously viewed.  I do appreciate the 3D, it was done well, but not made for3D originally.  All and all, I think the remake for 3D was very good.  Much better than my tv's 2D to 3D conversion.  There is nothing better than a movie made for 3D originally, this was always a great animated movie to begin with.  This movie shipped as promised, was in even better than promised.  Was a five disk set, all perfect, but no digital copy  with the previously viewed. :)
B00E7SXPVW|5.0|When I received the album through the mail, I listened to it immediately. I loved the sound quality. It's louder than the original album, which I liked a lot. I read a lot of reviews about the loudness war, and hear people say they don't like it being louder, but I sure do
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I installed the Kindle app on my Galaxy S4 and love it. When I am waiting somewhere, or traveling, it is so nice to have a book to open and read.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Amazing season! Excellent performances by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. The pink teddy bear will keep you theorizing til the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so addictid to this game. I love the challenge of the different levels. I love how every game is different
B00C2IJJLO|5.0|A masterpiece in every way: writing, photography, casting, ACTING! Should have received many Oscars in every category. Faye Dunaway's most memorable performance.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A love story that will keep you on your toes and in the mood, get ready for home steamy reading!
B00CHVIAS4|4.0|I was constantly amazed and entertained by the surprising script. The Croods extended family were all fascinating and their adventures were extremely imaginative. The weird creature combinations were a bit over the top though, I would have preferred more realistic dinosaur types.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|We all wanted it know what happened to little Danny and King has put all the questions &#34;to sleep&#34;.  I've been a devoted fan for over 30 years and this one book has knocked it out of the ball park!  A wonderful plot and nice ending to a long saga of the Torrance family.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Just finished this book and was delighted that I'd finally read it. The premise seems fresh and original and the characters are wonderfully drawn. Some of the best fantasy I've read in ages.<br /><br />Hopping straight into the second book now!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't know if the information wasn't there or I just missed it, but you have to have Windows Vista or higher to make this work.  I am now waiting for my son (the computer wizard) to install Windows 7 so I can happily stream web-only content to my TV.  Looking forward to the day!!
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Great book! I want to read more in the series. Ian Fleming was a cool secret agent. Will definitely be picking up other books by Stevenson!
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. The story telling was excellent. The effects and make-up were fantastic. If you love horror movies this will be a new classic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally the real candy crush on Amazon I play this on my friends Ipad and now it's on amazon I LOVE  this game it is so much fun I highly recommend!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved, loved,loved this book. The epilogue was my favorite part! The characters were funny and real and I definitely relate to the mom angles. Highly recommend.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Ive always loved this movie because its such a great story and im so glad I have it in blu ray now!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show with lots of action! Great if you love family and motorcycles! Does have lots of violence though. Great characters!
B005CRQ3H0|4.0|A good book, a bit strange but very enjoyable.  I had not read a Pynchon book before, but after this one, I plan to read more of them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had been waiting for this game.  Love to play it on my Kindle.  So much fun but quite addictive.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is creative. A lot to follow and confusing at times but a lot of fun. Has me captivated. I don't want to put my kindle down.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|This movie is heartwarming and has a powerful message that we can all use these days. I recommend this to anyone who is tired of shoot 'em up or cut 'em up movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was an awesome read I truly did not see where it was going and I can't wait to read the next book! :D
B00D2I8E46|4.0|This set suffers from my own inflated expectations. I'm pretty much a sucker for everything Elvis does and have always liked Questlove and the Roots, so, i figured, Wise Up Ghost would be stellar. Which it kinda is, but in a lower gear. I always enjoy great songwriters revisiting their material and Elvis and Roots deconstruct some memorable tracks. If i had a colorable complaint, it would be that the backing tracks are  monosonous. The set sorta reminds me of Get Happy! a stripped-down gem that, when it came out, was widely considered a misstep (if not just an inadequate apology for the unfortunate Ray Charles/James Brown brouhaha) and was appreciated only after the passage of time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game takes good concentration and is super addicting I love it heres a tip if you get the game try to save the power ups you get for free from the game save them for when you really need them for a level
B0079XPUOW|1.0|not worth the trouble. Poorly written and disapointing picking  trying to follow the story and characters. I cant think of anting good to say about it.
0767919408|3.0|Like grading on a curve I find myself giving this review more criticism only because Bill Bryson has set an amazingly high bar with works like a Brief History of Nearly Everything and At Home.  This is a serviceable history of the Jazz Age done through the lens of one year, 1927.  Bryson does a great job of probing some of the great social issues of the day and showing us how the 1920s were an era of huge societal change. What is lacking is Bryson's usual depth of historical probing.  Yes he does a great job of showing us how characters both big and small were key players in this program but what's lacking is the usual Bryson method of telling one story and have it turn into dozens more, all of which tie back.<br /><br />Still this is a Bill Bryson book which means it's worth your time.  A mediocre book by Bill Bryson is better than a great book by most writers. Make time to read this!
B009AMANBA|3.0|The movie goes quite slow, it's not bad but rather boring in certain parts and okay in others.  Lincoln dies at the end.
B004LQJPEG|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with the movie. The book was better. I know that the story had to be simplified somewhat in order to fit into a movie, but still, I felt that the book was more interesting.
B00E7RZEI0|3.0|This game works for Kindle Fire 7&quot; HD<br />  This game keeps you hooked on but then it starts to get boring, I am right now almost finishing the game (short) but it is fustrating, yet...<br />  !!CHALLENGING!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app. The numbers are large. The musical alarm is good. I like getting the weather daily. It's simple, easy to use.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I just wish there were more lives at a time!  They take too long to accumulate more unless you spend money on it
006202406X|5.0|While everyone is reviewing this novel, keep in mind everyone came into it with different expectations. To the reviewer who claimed that he/she could have written this novel better I would like to strongly disagree.<br /><br />Even if a book doesn't end the way you want it to, it doesn't make a bad book. Sure, Roth had plot holes, unrealistic errors, and very similar point of views from Tobias and Tris, but I loved it.<br /><br />I read this book cover to cover and had to let the ending sink in, as another user suggested. I believe Roth ended the novel the way she wanted to, and I admire her for it. The ending was more realistic, but as others have pointed out could have been even more so.<br /><br />All in all, this was Veronica Roth's novel. She wrote what she wanted to. I loved this entire series. I waited for every single book I was not disappointed. To anyone who says they could have done better: I would like to see you try.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should all buy this game sure its expensive but you can always earn your allowance back.PLEASE GET WORTH IT
B000784WMW|5.0|A young Tim gives the viewer all the power and arrogance to the rich Mr Rochester.  But we see the subtle moments as he slowly falls in love with Jane.  We feel his heartbreak once he's denied the opportunity to marry Jane.  Grab the tissues!  I love how this film version ends, giving us a more satisfying ending compared to others that I've seen.  A MUST have for Dalton and Jane Eyre fans!  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Although the BBC budget limits the staging of this film ... it  is loaded with love, laughter, and heartwarming passion.  Excellent storytelling. Highly recommend to all ages.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have enjoyed this app.  I have had a few problems but survived as of now.  I encourage you to take the challenge. You will like it
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|You get to a level and you are stuck. They want you to purchase things. So much for being free.  Once you are out of lives you have to wait 20 or 30 minutes before playing again.  Very frustrating!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Dear Amazon,<br />I am so so glad you finally added candy crush saga to you list.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Xoxo<br /><br />PS: Please also add everything else. That is all.<br />(Oh and it all seems to be working great!)
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Divergent I read avidly, completely engrossed in the choices made by a girl who is in the process of reaching maturity.  Insurgent I read with real interest, if not with the same fascination I found while reading the first book.  Allegiant began slowly.  My interest flagged and I had to push myself to stay with it.  I found the fluctuating point of view writing mechanic confusing and tedious.<br /><br />That said, the pace picked up when our heroes make it to the Bureau.  I actually enjoyed the sociology related to this flawed society, a society that chose a simplistic rationale as a reason for impossibly difficult societal ills.  Some things  I liked, some I didn't.  That is how my view of the book came up as, &#34;It's okay,&#34; or 3 stars.<br /><br />Based on the reviews i have read, a lot of folks are really unhappy with the ending.  I hate spoilers so I won't provide any here.  However, those of you who are angry, remember that Tris was raised Abnegation.  Her earliest teachings were from that venue.  She idolized her parents for their selflessness even as she chose Dauntless as her faction.  Tobias too carries those early teachings in his psyche and those teachings were a force in each of their choices.<br /><br />I can't second guess the author, but I think Ms. Roth was demonstrating that upbringing and teachings, rather than genetic structure, are critical in any discussion of choices and behavior.  Science has llong questioned whether background or genetics is the primary motivating factor.  My theory is that the author tried to demonstrate that a genetic pre-disposition to leap into danger when necessary was tempered by those initials teachings of selflessness.  We, as humans are shaped by both genetics and society.  I didn't feel the anger.  Tris did what her parents would have done, and was at peace with that decision.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|i am old and it plays too fast for me and i only play cause my friends asked me to.
B008I34YYY|5.0|It's funny, it's ridiculous, my wife couldn't watch it, and it had &#34;A&#34; movie special effects.  It was just what I was hoping for.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Great color and sound. I have watched it with my son three times since he got it. I don't know how many times he has watched it.
1596177373|5.0|I really really really like these cards.  They are a very nice quality and super awesome.  Truly one of a kind.
B00433SVP6|5.0|It was very interesting because the author used some words that made the writer very interested and keep reading on until you finished the book. Even then you wanted to read more.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am normally not one to write reviews but as someone who read Divergent and Insurgent and anticipated reading the conclusion in Allegiant the offering Ms. Roth gave was lackluster and disappointing.<br /><br />Not only was the book slow from beginning to end, but the ending was so senseless it made the entire series not worth reading. The cliffhanger ending of Insurgent lead me to believe I would get a really good idea of why the cities were founded and so on..but the reasoning she gave were not even plausible, the ideas were loosely tied together and the cohesiveness of the story was non-existent.<br /><br />Now Ms. Roth is the author and she has the prerogative to kill off as many main characters as she likes..but she should at least give the reader a set up or something and definitely give us more closure or reasoning.<br /><br />Did I like the ending? No, but even if the book would have ended differently I would still not have enjoyed the book very much or read it had I not read the first two.<br /><br />If you read the first two books of the series I would say go ahead and read the conclusion because while it is not good you have put in the time and passion into the series. If you haven't read the other books don't even start Divergent.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|This app is great i can take pictures and set a timer on it! My mom loves it too! I recommend it.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|To start off , it was ok. I mean I'm glad i watched it, but not at the movie theater . I don't think the story was the greatest, and Nicholas cage's voice for this role was not fitted very well. I think that him doing that voice just wasn't right. Over all ok, but I'm not going to go buy it on dvd any time soon
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This book was very interesting in the way Elizabeth Gilbert wove her plot around historical facts and people. The various settings also made the story line a compelling read. She also developed her characters in such a way that you really feel like you know how they think about everything. A fascinating read!
0670921912|5.0|Don't cheat yourself by not buying this book. I saw the author go over his concepts in an interview online and I just knew I should buy it. I've been reading it everyday, a few chapters at a time. Thanks to this author I can learn knew skills now.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|This haunting, brilliant documentary is explained in detail by other reviewers here, so I will skip the backstory and make a plea for action.<br /><br />All of us have the power to put Sea World OUT OF BUSINESS forever simply by refusing to patronize the sea parks. I hope everyone who views this film will make an effort to spread the word and get others to view it too. Then think about it.  And choose to never EVER again buy tickets to these kinds of exploitive amusement parks.<br /><br />Don't be mesmerized by the glamorous lies, spin and SeaWorld commercials. It's not about \\"educating the public, conserving the environment, and supporting wildlife\\" as SeaWorld claims.  It's about their history of disregard for the animals stolen from the wild all over the planet, deceit, and trading of trainer safety for the benefit of the billion dollar industry and almighty profits.<br /><br />Take your kids somewhere else. Teach them about nature in ways that respect the glory of the wilderness, and the intelligence, and natural beauty, of the wildlife that still share the planet with us.<br /><br />As sad as it is, the real tragedy is not just that trainers like Dawn Brancheau were killed. At least, those delusional trainers made the choice (for whatever reason) to go into those tanks and foolishly transform the splendid, regal orca into nothing but a trained circus clown for profit. The baby whales, like Tilikum, never had a choice when barbarically ripped from their mother's side and subjected to unnatural cage life, solitude, hopeless deprivation, semen pumping for extreme profit, and pathetic daily barking for his fish dinner.<br /><br />To imprison orcas-- animals of extreme intelligence and emotional depth-- just to amuse your kids for an day on your vacation is morally repugnant and down right disgusting.<br /><br />Yes, free the whales. You don't need to cry out for a ban. Just don't buy a ticket ever again.<br /><br />THAT will ultimately free all the imprisoned whales and freak shows like SeaWorld will be looked upon in future years with horror... as primitive, barbaric and crude chambers of torture and shame... and our ancestors will be shocked that we ever had the extreme audacity to exploit them for money in this horrid, heartbreaking way.<br /><br />Please show your finer humanity. Let's ALL shut down these parks forever! You can change the world with the power of your wallet.<br /><br />For a real eye-opener, do a search for \\"The Orca Project\\" online and read about Tilikum's tragic current living conditions now that he is banned to extreme isolation at SeaWorld and see if you can ever believe anything they say again. Though he's too damaged to ever live in the wild again, there are online petitions to pressure SeaWorld to release Tilikum to a supervised ocean sea pen to spend out his days with more dignity and space.<br /><br />UPDATE on 12/10/13  News is spreading thanks to this documentary! \\"Add HEART to the list of bands that are bowing out of a show at SeaWorld because of the CNN documentary \\"Blackfish.\\" Country singer WILLIE NELSON and Canadian rock act BARENAKED LADIES also pulled the plug on their shows...\\"  YES!  Meanwhile, SeaWorld claims that everyone is ignorant and they continue to tout their false image as conservationists and propaganda nonsense that whitewashes their dark history. I hope all concerned will keep the message alive and go to their Facebook pages and THANK THEM for their commitment!
0316204366|3.0|Although David and Goliath does make some interesting points, I thought that Gladwell's latest book was not nearly as insightful and well thought out as his previous efforts. Blink, The Tipping Point, and Outliers all really made me think, and turned a lot of my preconceived notions on end. Reading David and Goliath I couldn't help but think &#34;yes...ok...so?&#34; I thought his explanations and conclusions were over simplified and not nearly as thought provoking as previous works. Everything about the book felt rushed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you liked The Kite Runner, you will love this book.  So. ma  manny beautiful characters and a lovely resolution
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Who knows how good it is? Nothing I did could get it to appear on my Android phone, unlike other apps I have downloaded from here. I guess I'll keep trying.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I could not put this one down! Great character development. One of the best I've read from John Grisham. A great, fast read!
0307474259|5.0|Mr. Taubes has literally changed my life with this book.  Had weight challenges most of my adult life, and tried many diet &#34;plans&#34; with limited and temporary success.  Heard about this book a little over a year ago, got it, and was inspired to do a bit more research.  End of October 2012, decided to try a lower carb / higher protein diet...and after a year have lost 50 pounds via no-stress change in eating habits.  No longer have uncontrollable food urges and feel confident that I can maintain this healthier lifestyle for the remainder of my days.  Do I crave pizza, pasta, bread, rice, etc, etc?  No, not so much, LOL.<br /><br />Lab results last week showed better cholesterol balance, elimination of pre-diabetes condition, and much reduced risk of metabolic syndrome as well.  I still have some health issues, as a survivor of 9 heart surgeries, I can't completely escape my past.  But...I'm a LOT more confident in having a future.<br /><br />I do realize that my carbohydrate &#34;addiction&#34; is not the same as everyone out there who struggles with weight control.  But it's possible that it does affect many other folks in a negative way like it did for me in the last 50 years.  I'd urge anyone to read this well researched book...it just might change your life too.  :-)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I saw this book under the recommends after I finished The Dinner, which I also really liked.  Both are great stories about what a parent will do for her/his child.  A really good, intense read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A well written web on circumstances, choice and free-will. Very well crafted<br />I look forward to reading all of the author's work.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|How I feel having rented this terrible movie, knowing full well the critical consensus. Still, &#34;The Hangover Part III&#34; was far worse than I was led to understand.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! Have always been a fan of Panic and this raises my opinion even more. I would buy it again without  any problem.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had no idea, upon beginning this novel, that there really was an Orphan Train that traveled from New York City west, as far as North Dakota, from 1854-1924!  You must read this novel to find out about the many thousands of children and their experiences.  Most of us will NEVER have to 'muster up' such strength, bravery and resilience. Don't forget to read the Epilogue and view the photos, as well.  Very few of the 'orphans' are alive today.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|So disappointing!! If you loved the first two like I did, leave it at that. I kept hoping it would get better as I continued to read but it was so boring and redundant and I kept losing track of whose POV I was reading because the cadence and the &#34;voices&#34; of the characters were the same! Awful and such a let down.. I was hoping Roth's disjointed and stilted writing style would improve by her third novel but it continued terribly. I only kept reading to get some closure and I'm still unsatisfied. The one reviewer who called this a masterpiece and compared it to the likes of Harry Potter is delusional. Way to let an entire fandom down Veronica!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love this on my Kindle Fire HD. Easy to see designs, challenging, and just plain fun. Recommend for all. Like the layout.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is the best game ever.<br />so get the game it won't be a mistake and if you win come too my house please
B00EUEWRUI|5.0|Very enjoyable show from one of my favorite bands.  Audio/video quality is very good.  If you're a DP fan, you should have this.
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|Good book for one-night reading, at least I couldn't finish before reaching end of the book. Well composed, interesting characters.
140006922X|5.0|A great read with a wealth of historical details on the times described. It makes very clear that Jesus was only one of many zealots that the Roman Empire crucified.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Really fun game & addictive BUT it has a timer and if you don't use a network to access their prizes, upgrades etc it locks you out right in the middle of your game for several minutes!  Very frustrating!!!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this game it is epic and it has the best graphics I recommend it so much I'm giving it a 5 star just like the developer
B009V0TV6O|5.0|What a cool app for musicians of all abilities ! This app is not just a simple metronome.  Highlights for me are choosing which beat is accented, choosing the sound of the beats, able customize a rhythm pattern and save it. A gem of a faotd, a bargain at full price.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game. Good speed, does not freeze up. My only problem is the level limit. Without help or buying.... I recommend this.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Connelly tells a great story and never disappoints a reader. Even when you're sure you've figured it all out, he'll throw you a curve ball when you expected a fast ball.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I mean this game is boss. From the brutal story mode to. To sliding and knifeing a enemy in multiplayer. It is a really fun game if u like this u would love nova 3
B008GFI4KY|5.0|I was a fan from the first album and saw them 3x in concert and they<br />are the real deal! they got the music and live show that people use to<br />love in the 70's and 80's! this album should've been BIG! The debut<br />album is the best the 2nd album was more Queen ACDC mix but still<br />brilliant but not for a follow up to the debut! this album should've been<br />the follow up! it's got the catchy riffs great playing singing and hooks<br />without all the fluff and over production. I hope they continue even though<br />this didn't set the world on fire! they deserve to be even BIGGER! ROCK ON!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|so far so good...just trying to figure out how it works...any help?  it seems you need to upgrade if you want anything other than the basic clock
B00AEFY4CG|1.0|what a piece of crap! can't believe how many of you like this garbage!<br />to use the name ghost in a movie like this is a crime! it should have<br />been called invisible! cause it's got nothing nobody would want to see!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool when you get to go run get cool objects and lot of coins to buy cool things!!!!!!!!!
B00DJYJPLO|4.0|Is Before Midnight a good movie? Yes.<br />Do I care to see the continuation of the lives of Jessie and Celine? Not really.<br /><br />I watched these movies as they came out. Before Sunrise in the 90s and Before Sunset in the 2000s. These movies have always been more about the pondering of Jessie and Celine than any real progression of their relationship.  I suppose I was expecting more deep insight and intelligent discussion, but this movie isn't about that.  This movie is THE movie about Jessie and Celine. This is about their friends, family, and the complications of their relationship.<br /><br />Delpy and Hawke's chemistry is still here after all these years, the acting is as good as it's always been, the Grecian backdrop is gorgeous, and the story feels real.<br /><br />(MINOR SPOILER)<br /><br />But Jessie and Celine have devolved as people. There is a verbally-intense fight scene that struck me as too mean-spirited. I don't respect these characters any more.  I know people may defend this film as a dose of reality of two imperfect people and I'm not arguing that. Celine's borderline insanity combined with Jessie's guilt-inducing prattling about his son just wore me out.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is a movie worth watching. It contains all the brutal elements of relationships and all that it entails. But I don't care about what happens before noon, before brunch, or before anything anymore.<br /><br />My love for these characters has simply died. C'est la vie.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|My title says it all, really. Even though it has some flaws (like the clich&eacute;d villains), the journey of Paul Atreides, the world building of Dune, the conflicts between the characters, were extraordinary. This book essentially made me into a science-fiction fan. If you're a SFF fan you really should have this in your collection. There is no excuse.
B009GEAWOU|4.0|Even though Netflix carries HIMYM as well, Amazon video has the most recent season available sooner. My only complaint is the price, but to me this show is worth it.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This novella was a great, quick read. I was actually pretty shocked it WAS even a novella; so much seems to happen within the pages. The concepts and world-building were good if a bit rushed and Shai is an interesting character.
0385523394|5.0|Love this book!!  Very funny and reminds us that we are all humans with similarities regardless of where we come from or what we have done in our lives.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book does a great job of paying homage to a fallen hero. It is a heart-wrenching story but so full of inspiration and warmth.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|i loved Decemberground..hated Crash Love.  However, Burials is why I loved the band in the first place...it was the potential that you live for in any music/band you fall in love with.  Something about the band just rings true..and you know it... yes Crash Love was something..not sure but this is the roots..maturity..whatever creativity that was sparked that is brilliant. NUFF SAID.
B00ESH04LQ|5.0|I love this adaptation. Maybe I'm biased because I like Joss Whedon, or Nathan Fillion, or pretty much every other actor in this movie... but this is probably my favorite version of the movie. It took me a few minutes to get used to the &#34;ye olde english&#34; speech in such a modern setting, but it definitely worked, the acting was great, the humor was there, and this was totally worth buying. If you love Much Ado About Nothing and haven't seen this yet, do it! Do it now! It's so good! Haha
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good game makes you think Def needs more levels as 10 is not enough but will look out for more to come and it's great that it's Free
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fantastic read! Great story! I was so happy to see where Danny's story went. Score another one for Mr. King!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is amazing!!! I love pintrest I am a teacher and always looking for cool ideas!!! This app never freezes and is really well set up!!!! If I could I would give it a million stars!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so much..its very challenging as you go up in different levels..try it yourself. you will never get bored. It works well on smart phones and kindles and even down in the crowded subways of New York during rush hour...this connection never drops...have fun everyone..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I side loaded the apk file ages ago to my kindle but it is so nice to have it officially available!  I wish I was not as addicted to this game as I am but seriously it is the best, relaxing fun game I have.  I love the gameboard it makes me feel like a kid playing candyland again.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Used it for class --- good for examples of life inside mental health.  Students could relate to peer groups and activities occurring
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Now if only I could get it on my husband's older windows phone life would be perfect!  I have LOVED the sync features and have found that I no longer use many of my apps I previously loved and would prefer to just use this one for everything.  Flexible and easy to use.  I have ADHD and find this app a blessing to keeping me organized and not forget something important.  LOVE it!  I have grocery lists for the 3 main stores I go to, a list of common purchase items that I never remember the specs on like furnace filter size, printer cartridge type, etc.  I have chore list for each of my girls that I have shared to them so they can see them on their kindles and I get an email when they have completed them for the day.  I even have my own chore list and a quick daily to do list I can jot things I don't want to forget.  I am sure their are even more uses but those are some I have found the most helpful to me!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm writing this after just reading the most life changing devastating horrible amazing terrible perfect awful books I've ever read. This may sound cheesy but really words can't describe how I'm feeling right now. I can barely see this through my tears. I've cried for what seems like hours and I probably won't stop for days. Read it. Please... This whole review sounds so stupid compared to what it deserves... But nothing less than 5 stars. If only I could give this book a gazzillion stars. I cried more than I did in the help, titanic, or any other book I've read/movie I've seen.
1452110581|5.0|These poems do sound like what my cats would say if they could.  I loved the book and purchased one for a friend who lost one of her cats.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Any age group will be gripped by this brilliant book by Brandt Legg. It is a real page turner and I could not put it down. I love when I find books like this! The story line draws you in quickly and keeps the reader wanting to find out more. It is a fascinating, tragic story but quite addictive. I will certainly be looking out for the other books in this trilogy.<br />Get this book you will love it!<br /> Highly recommended!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As I am almost a student of Steve King, I feel good about the rating I gave the novel. The second half of the book is clearly better than the first, as is often the case when characters are being pulled together in the beginning. If I am being critical I thought that the buildup up to the end was a little too long and the ending a little too short. But hey every novel can't be Duma Key. Good job though as it is always hard to revisit a earlier story. Worth the read.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This works so well with my Mac. Easy to set up and use, the free version is only for local WiFi network but this is fine for casual use.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Plenty of action .Told the backstory of Loki and Thor relationship. They way it was tried into today was well done.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Growing up I used the V6's, not much more can be said about these headphones that hasn't already been said, but they have a great balance, not overly bass heavy and they fit comfortably, a quality pair of monitors built to last.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I love the graphics and the challenges. I wish they would have put that you need to tilt the device some times in the tutorial.. But with the nice hints they give on each challenge, I finally figured it out. Very fun game.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Janelle is a precocious talent if there ever was one. This is what we're looking for in the new music of today - imagination, creativity, inspiration, and guts. Janelle is a universal artist, influenced by and acknowledging just about every musical genre. There's so much going on here that it's amazing this album works at the level it does, so diverse is the content; but it does since it is all held together by a singular conceptual vision, lasting melodies, and quality production values (just like all the great concept albums). Cold War is just a super performance, a tune that lingers, a message that resonates, a voice that moves - the best track of the year (check out the video); Mushrooms and Roses - Prince-like psychedelia brought into the 21st century, and what a production; Wondaland - as catchy as any tune has a right to be. And we all know about Tightrope. Just listen to what is going on with the background vocals and orchestral/electronic fills on this album. There's a lot of fun here too, which speaks to the artist not taking herself too seriously (also evident in the sleeve notes), and that's a good check valve to have. Janelle has the voice to sing anything and the technique and discipline to do it justice. There's no holding her back here, and, if something as good as Archandroid is the result, that's something we can all applaud and appreciate in terms of popular music evolution (or is that revolution). Can't wait until her next one.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Love it!  As everyone else has stated, it does sound like old Sabbath.  You can definitely hear some influences from old songs, but it does not come off as a rip-off, but more of an inspiration or continuation of something great.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Tapping into the English folk consciousness like never before, Ian Anderson produced this masterpiece with the help of his mates in 1977. The band was never better than on this record. In terms of an overall vision, and execution thereof, I believe it is their best (yes, in that regard, I think it tops TAAB). It's an inspired piece of work, and like all great art, seems to have been with us forever. Pastoral rock perfection.<br />\\"Kindled by the dying embers of another working day.\\"
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Kept waiting for this movie to get good, but it never happened. It was too long and failed to keep my attention.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am an avid reader and have been looking forward to this book for a long time.  Now that I have read it, I sit here desperately wishing that I had never even started this trilogy.  While I agree that this book had glaring holes and inconsistencies, I will never get over the fact that Tris was killed (and in such a senseless and ridiculous way).  Veronica Roth has lost me as a fan.  I will not see the movie, I will no longer recommend these books to friends and family, and I will not read anymore of her work.  I feel betrayed.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I'm not sure about this device yet. I have not gotten it to work as advertised. The instructions are very confusing and when I plug it in, it turns red, it maybe something I'm doing so I'm in the process of working it out.  I'm using it with a laptop so maybe there is something I missed on the setup. I'll write more after I have used a while. that is if I can use it. More to come
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited to finally have Candy Crush on my kindle! Love the game and have not had any problems from the app. It's an addictive game so be ready to get sucked in if you down load it. The levels are challenging and there are a lot of them!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Very good game and it does not crash and the rest is good for any body who likes gun games and is very good
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Have played a lot of different Mahjong games over the years and this one is far from disappointing. Good graphics, crafty tile placements and all the features you need to get lost in the game!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I read Divergent at a friend's recommendation and recommended it to my daughter and others. I then waited impatiently for Insurgent. My glee Monday night at midnight hitting ... somewhere ... so my ebook would arrive was electrifying. I read eight chapters before I went to bed. Now it's Thursday at 6 p.m. and I'm ready to hand it off to my daughter, excited for her to read it as quickly so we can compare notes on the ending I didn't see coming.<br /><br />Great job, Veronica Roth. I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|I recommend this film for all Audrey afficienados , or for anyone enamored of this particular movie era who wants to see a very young George Peppard, Buddy Ebsen and Mickey Rooney, of all people  in a zany comic turn as an eratic Asian upstairs neighbor.  For feline/animal lovers, the cat, who plays Cat, is also especially winsome and sympathetic in this very stylized romantic tale.  Even if Audrey's wardrobe is very suspect assuming her role's financial status, suspending disbelief is all worth it for those very few minutes when Audrey herself croons the classic, poignant &#34;Moon River&#34; theme song.
0385528787|5.0|I'm one of those who waited for this last book in the trilogy. After having read Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood, I couldn't make heads or tails of where Atwood was going with this dystopian tale. Was it a thought experiment designed to caution mankind of our hubris, of our eventual destruction by our own hands? It seemed that way I was sure of it, but after having finished Maddaddam, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Atwood, at least the way I read it, was making a case for the importance of storytelling, of how necessary it was even as humanity had become stripped with all the trappings of convenience and luxury, of how art redeemed us, how it restored our humanity.<br /><br />I don't believe it necessary to have read the first two books in the trilogy, for Atwood was gracious enough to give a summation of sorts in the beginning of Maddaddam before she started the story proper. The reading experience would, however, become more enriching if the trilogy is taken together, as I did, as one full narrative. Language itself wasn't taken for granted for the purpose of world-building, as other dystopian novels wantonly do, because the writing is spectacular all throughout, with beautiful turns-of-phrase, characterizations and distinctive dialogue for men and women alike. An excellent read.
006202406X|1.0|I was hoping that the final installment would bring some cohesion to this provocative dystopia as well as hone the author's young skill.  It renders the series absolutely pointless.
0062255657|5.0|This book is Neil Gaiman's best novel, bar none. I would still recommend Sandman to anyone who has never heard of Neil Gaiman before or has never read any of his work (which should be no one if you ask me) but for those who do not have the patience, wherewithal and endurance to read a 75-issue graphic novel or who think that nothing good comes out of comic books (not true!), then I'll recommended The Ocean at the End of the Lane instead. Not that American Gods, Neverwhere, Stardust, Anansi Boys, The Graveyard Book, or even Good Omens (written with Terry Pratchett), aren't any good, because they all are, it's just that this latest is in a league of its own.<br /><br />It's honest and magical, and the fantastical elements are so grounded in reality and the mundane that those who are opposed to reading fantasy and who like their stories to be realist may find themselves enjoying this one too. What makes it different? Well, feelings mostly, and the story becomes incidental to that, not that the story takes a backseat, no, because Gaiman's greatest strength is still his storytelling. In its exploration of childhood and memory, it surfaces the necessary nostalgia most adults feel about their own growing up years, including its particular pains, confusions and tribulations. This is how powerful novels feel like, stirring emotions from the reader without having to use melodrama. I'd say read it.
061891868X|5.0|Many of today's discussions about cosmology rave about string theory. As a non-physicist it is difficult to form my own opinion about this as the mathematics needed to understand the theory is daunting. In this book however, Smolin has concisely explained the benefits of string theory as well as its weaknesses. Although it is easy to obtain an inaccurate view of the merits of a topic by reading a single book, this book appears to provide convincing arguments about why string theory is off track or that other avenues of basic research also need to be studied. I particularly liked the sections on the politics of scientific research. The importance of older high profile people in deciding the best scientific problems to study has not received the attention in the popular press that it should have. Too often the views of senior scientists are taken as gospel and, like in many other areas of life, these views are often incorrect. If you study the Arts in university it is well recognized that to get good marks in a subject you need to understand the lecturer's biases and feed them back to him/her during exams - independent thought in the Arts that is at odds with the lecturer only results in poor marks. It needs to be more widely appreciated that this also applies to scientific research.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game to occupy your mind and show how strategic you can be.  Also great fun for the young and old.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best ever alarm clock.  It's simple to use and you can changes the style of clock too.  Totally recommend this app.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this. So competitive even with myself, so this is such a good game.  Didn't buy it for myself but I ended up using it more.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I read a lot of the 1 and 2 stars reviews before buying, and was almost discouraged from reading the final book.  Some readers were returning their books, would never watch the movie--wow, how could the final book be so poorly written??<br /><br />It isn't!  Knowing the ending from all the &#34;spoilers&#34; helped me read it looking for the author's clue to why she chose this ending.  In my opinion, the ending fit the story, and this third book wrapped up the entire trilogy well enough for fans to enjoy.<br /><br />There were some unbelievable plot turns (having so much freedom as visitors to the Bureau, knowing how to manipulate all the complex serums, being brought into confidence with the rebels so quickly...).  It wasn't enough to not enjoy the story.  I am not critical of how Evelyn or any other characters changed their tone--they should evolve with the strain of their situation, for better or worse.<br /><br /> I understand wanting to voice Tobias' view to help tell the story, but I agree with others that I had a hard time keeping clear if it Tris was telling the story or Tobias, since there was little difference in their tone.  It was a bit distracting.<br /><br />All in all, I found the ending actually really refreshing!  I liked all the revelations about the reason for the factions, experiments, and those controlling it.  I would have preferred that our strong and brave heroine save the day and go on to tell Tobias' children about it.  It was tragic, but I thought it actually fit with the trend of the story from the beginning.  This happens all the time in novels and movies to the hero (a male), and the girl goes on to grieve and live another day without him.  Are all the readers so bothered by this because she is the girl??  It is a YA series, but also a dystopia genre, which sets the stage for sometimes cruel and tragic lives.  It works here...<br /><br />I thought the epilogue finished it off nicely, and you should feel good about the end by the last page.  There is hope, friendship, and the beginnings of peace with the memories they keep.  It is a new beginning.<br /><br />I take off a star because the narration is distracting, and some of the skills/knowledge/access the characters has is not believable.  I would recommend it to anyone who has already enjoyed the first two books!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|my family enjoys this game and the graphics aren't bad. moved along quickly n easily. would recommend this game if u like games like tap zoo.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|this is a great game and once I saw it on the kindle I was so excited but then when I tried to install it would download but says that it can't install so FIX IT flu.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|A great gamer focused CPU. It's running perfect w/ the stock fan, averaging 29-32 idle, and not seeing temps above 65c under full load. Honestly, I might overclock it slightly w/ the stock fan just because it's running so cool!<br /><br />Compared to my Q6660 old quad, this is night-and-day in terms of performance.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My wife was playing this with my son's on her kindle. I wanted to join in the fun so<br />I download the app yesterday and have been playing non stop.
B007R21JJK|5.0|Installed a new Intel Core i5-3570K and 8GB's of ddr3-1600 mhz ram. Not a single issue to report. I didn't even have to reinstall my O.S. (8.1). That was very surprising.<br /><br />Booted right up one 1st try. Gigabyte knows motherboards. I'll always go through them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've always loved candy crush on my iphone and was so excited when it became available on kindle. It's a great game and it's addictive!!
1452110581|4.0|this was a gift for someone that loves and owns several cats. she really enjoyed the silly poems! i am delighted with this purchase.
B0084AXZK0|2.0|I found the plot to be a bit too weird to my liking.  The author had to stretch too much to support a scientifically absurd phenomenon.  The philosophy espoused by one of the main characters throughout the story was more than I could stomach.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|This is an adorable and rollicking &#34;steam-punkish&#34; series - you don't have to order any other books to have the entire series, too, which I VERY MUCH appreciated. The characters are marvelous - especially Prudence and her mother... of course, Dad's not bad, either. And ten cheers for vampire count &#34;next door&#34;... too precious for words, really! The adventures are not wholly predictable, there is not a lot of actual violence, the incorporation of mythology is very well-done, as are the Egyptian scenes... what is NOT to like here? NOTHING that I can find. Hope to read more of Carriger very soon!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Picked this up for free because it was free and now will gladly pay for any future titles from this developer! Sucked me in from the first moment with the story plot and puzzles that are challenging but not impossible.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|No one tell a tale like John Grishman.  The Racketeer is another good example of this wonderful skill.  The book keep me guessing right up to the end.
1742204147|5.0|I have used Lonely Planet guides for many years and have always found them to be useful both in planning trips and while on the road. The 2013 guide to Japan is one of LP's best guidebooks.<br /><br />This edition of LP Japan is the latest update to a series than began in 1981. Consequently, the book has a lot of very useful, real life practical information that has accumulated over its more than thirty years of existence. Even though pretty much the entire LP product range was redesigned a couple of years ago to the detriment of some of its guides, LP Japan has not suffered at all from the new graphic and organization scheme.<br /><br />Particularly strong sections include coverage of regional food specialties, advice on how to properly deal with hotels (first off, it's always best to call ahead and be expected, even if you'll be arriving in only a few hours), and, for what usually turns out to be a highlight for most travelers, an overview of onsen (Japanese hot spring baths).<br /><br />A couple of caveats should be kept in mind. If you aren't interested in straying off the beaten path much or aren't open to trading off comfort and predictability for character and the unexpected, the LP ethos may not be a good fit for you. Also if you are only visiting one region or a couple of major cities, this 875-page guide may be too much book to drag around. There are plenty of city and regional guides from LP and other guidebook publishers that will cover, say, Kyoto in much greater detail than a national guide and omit several hundred pages of information you won't need.<br /><br />Bottom line: a time-tested classic, as long as you fit the Lonely Planet profile. This guide is especially strong in its collection of on-the-ground logistical and cultural tips. Five stars.<br /><br />----------<br />Note<br /><br />Those who are unfamiliar with Lonely Planet will want to know that:<br />* LP targets independent, do-it-yourself types of travelers (who often have backpacks, railpasses, and youth hostel cards).<br />* Travelers who are focused on staying in top-ranked hotels and eating at expensive restaurants probably won't find LP's sleeping and eating recommendations to be extensive enough. While there is some coverage of high-end, trendy, and luxurious places in this guide, it is not LP's strength.<br />* Most LP guides that cover large regions, including this one, are written by a team of contributors.<br />* New editions of a guide usually are updates of previous versions and are not entirely rewritten from scratch.<br />* The focus of the guide is on logistical and practical information. If you're looking for lots of glossy pictures or for \\"inspiration\\", LP country guides are not the best choice.lpasses, and youth hostel cards).<br />* Travelers who are focused on staying in top-ranked hotels and eating at expensive restaurants probably won't find LP's sleeping and eating recommendations to be extensive enough.

B008FPOIT6|4.0|Fun mystery/caper story that's well-constructed. Gives credit and respect to antiquity and to modern technologies equally. It won't keep you thinking about any profound insights once you're done, but not all books have to do so, after all.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Every update is worst than the last. If you put the brains of the makers of this app inside birds they would fly backwards. I cant believe with all the money (billions) behind facebook, they cant come up with a decent app for Kindle. This thing crashes, freezes, fails to load feeds, fails to log on, you name it, if its wrong it has it. Unbelievable.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this on ALL my devices - phones, tablets, desktop, laptops, netbooks (Win7, Android and Apple iOS7). I found it when I started doing research work and then discovered I usually had the info on the &#34;wrong&#34; device later (the one I didn't have with me!) This has been a lifesaver and is one tremendous program with more power than anticipated. You may also want to check out &#34;Penultimate&#34; by the same folks.<br /><br />It syncs seamlessly and without one even noticing... it allows you to add at least some &#34;formatting&#34; and such, too. What more could you want for FREE?????
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited when it became available on the kindle fire. It is quite challenging.It is also addictive. I would recommend it to everyone. Download and start having fun!
B009ZQFSRA|1.0|Not worth the time. This movie was terrible and unfortunately I watched some of it. Christian Bale must have needed the money.
1781162646|5.0|Really good novel that keeps you hooked from the first page.  King doesn't overdo the scary parts and has good charachter development.  Loved it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I really like Walking Dead, but the &#34;Bad Guys&#34; sometimes feel more like a tsunami of danger, instead of something sentient and deadly...They are simply something you are able to defeat with a &#34;seawall&#34;...<br /><br />But in &#34;Falling Skies&#34;, the bad guys have brains...They also have individual personalities and pride...Something the good guys can use against them...I like the fact the good guys have to use their brains to defeat the bad guys...
B0064MGU98|4.0|Characters are more interesting than plot, which to me is pretty standard legal.We're only a couple of episodes into it so we'll see.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have tried out numerous clock apps and this one is my favorite.  I really like how you can team it up with the weather app from the same  vendor Apalon.  This clock app is very easy to use and I really recommend you give it a try.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|KOL is back on track after a slight let down on Come Around Sundown. Enjoying each track more and more after multiple plays. Looking forward to seeing them live again, you can hear crowd sing-a-longs on a few tracks.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love this game. Haven't stopped playing it since I downloaded it. Highly recommended! Highly addictive and easy to play game.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|My husband and I love watching The Walking Dead.  I have frequently found myself holding my breath in one of the many tense situations the group finds itself.  They have done a great job of keeping things interesting.  On a side note, way too scary, violent, and bloody for the younger crowd.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.:-D all different types of challenges. Can be kind of addicting!! Would suggest to my friends who are looking for a new game to play
1476727651|5.0|There was nothing I didn't like about this book.  I remember reading \\"The Shining\\" in '87 when I was 15.  Great storyline and kept my attention very well...so much so that I found myself awake long after my bedtime because I couldn't put it down.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Don't you hate it when you can tell where the story is going?  Flynn writes better than that.  Not Steven King/Grisham level but still pretty good.
B004LUS390|2.0|It's a relatively decent application, so it puzzles me on why they feel the need to include Flurry Analytics in with the program. It says that you have the option to &quot;opt out&quot; of them collecting information from your device but it makes me leery that they would put this unrepentant garbage on people's personal devices to begin with. And how do I know once they have it in there that they'll behave and close the open hole they drilled in my device to siphon my information? At the very least, READ and opt out on the settings page. Flurry ain't nothin' nice so beware of them getting their hooks in...
B00B8ED7OS|5.0|A very well written paranormal/erotic same-sex story of Sirius and Julian' two half-human creatures although with very different non-human sides.  Both have secret desires and fears.  The intense, graphic sex scenes will not be for everyone, having said that they are exceptionally well written and I thoroughly enjoy Hermit's graphic imagination.  I usually judge a book by how long it takes me to read it and I admit I read this in one afternoon.  By the end you are wrapped in the lives of the two main characters and the ending will leaving you wanting for book 2!  Not for children or youths. Definitely a book for mature adults with open minds.  A wonderful and erotic ride to the very end.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love Spider and play quite often on my computer. This version allows me to lie in bed and play on my Kindle before I turn in for the night.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|for some reason it keeps taking me to someone else's farm and then gos out of it?! but other than that it is a awesome game
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Half the time I couldn't remember whose POV it was -- there was very little to distinguish between Tris and Four.  There should have been -- they were great characters in the first books. And the end?  That ending had no value, and I honestly don't see why it had to happen that way.  I cried not for what was in this book but what we lost - the strong, passionate character of Tris in book 1...sigh.<br /><br />What a bummer!  I guess read it to finish the series, but really?  Not much was resolved, not to my satisfaction at least.<br /><br />I don't know about anyone else, but I was excited about the movie -- now I figure, unless they plan to end VERY DIFFERENTLY (and hopefully have good acting) I won't bother watching it.  I mean, I am upset about a lot but a LOT could be forgiven if I at least got a happy ending. :/
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This would make such a COOL movie if they don't low budget the thing!!!!  King writes like a pro and it shows.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|very entertaining.  I enjoyed watching season 2.  Keeps you engaged and wondering what is going to happen next.  Recommend this season
0803731094|5.0|I'm sure I cannot explain just how much I love this book. It is undoubtedly my favourite book to have shared with my children. Julia Donaldson and Alex Scheffler rock! Over the years of sharing this, my children learned to finish sentences with the rhyming pattern, and now can recite the entire story from memory. Read more Julia Donaldson America! This book is #1 in UK child cherished households :-)<br /><br />(And watch for Gruffalo character illustrations of other Donaldson/Scheffler publications, my son spotted them where I never would have! The most fun is in Tiddler, look carefully!)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is really a great game - it grabs you and won't let go. It is really infectious;  I just want to keep playing trying to get to next level. Try it, you'll be glad you did!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game where you can care for your 3D horse, buy new locations and horses and more! It's really fun
B00F1J3G9C|5.0|While I wish my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 could support the password requirements my company put in this year for exchange email. This app seems to be as good or better. Very happy with it so far.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I love this type of game and I thought I would be able to play this on my first generation Kindle Fire. It took forever to download and when I finally tried to play it it wouldn't work. I couldn't get past the opening page. It does not work on the Kindle Fire 1st generation. I deleted it.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Yes, I understand this is a &#34;reboot&#34; but I thought it was respectfully done where the old fans would be able to appreciate both the differences and the roots of the franchise being honored.
0142407542|5.0|A beautiful sequel to The Gruffalo (though I always imagined the Grufflo's child as a boy rather than a girl)<br /><br />This refrain of the wonderful ryhmes of The Grufflao shows again how the small mouse can outsmart the larger and potentially more threatening Guffalo's daughter. I love that Julia Donaldson uses themes of smaller creatures possessing special powers (reference The Snail and the Whale), inspiring small children to thing big!
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|And he was right.... awesome book. Great use of the written word. I just finished this and will get nr 2 right away.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent show.  Hope the next season comes available soon.  I love the development o the characters.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting story of how lives interact.  This novel deals with moral subjects to ponder.  What would you do in this situation?<br />Easy reading.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent and very readable account of the historical Jesus.  Very different account than the biblical Jesus.  Thought provoking and Interesting.
1416955070|3.0|***Spoilers possible***<br /><br />I tried to get into this book, but judging by the amount of times I had to turn on the radio just to hear something besides the book, I'd say that experiment was a failure. I could chalk it up to it not being my thing, but I do like YA fantasy stories.<br /><br />Narration Note: The narrator's voice for Clary was fine, which is great because she's the main character and in pretty much every scene, but her voice for Isabelle made me think of nails on chalkboards and loud feedback from misbehaving speakers.<br /><br />Plot Note: I tried to like the story, and I got bored. Maybe it would be different if I was reading it. I don't know. The big plot twist was predictable but workable.<br /><br />Dialogue: Mostly decent, but there were times when I was seriously asking myself if Jace came with any other lines besides \\"Don't.\\" and Clary came with any lines besides, \\"Jace!\\" I found the confrontation dialogue to be thinly veiled information dumping sessions.<br /><br />Character Notes: I was waiting and waiting and waiting for the heroine to do something...and was disappointed. She makes some discoveries, faces a bit of danger, but mostly things happen around her. Other people protect her. I'm not saying that's inherently bad, but I guess I hoped for a more useful heroine. Jace really does come across as a jerk a lot. That speaks to the author's writing talent, but still makes for an annoying character to read. Simon, Isabelle, and Alec aren't expanded enough to form much of an opinion on. Luke becomes more important to the story as it goes on. He's probably my favorite character.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you love the series, wonderful. I'm glad you found a story that moved you. I couldn't get into it, and I likely won't bother with the rest. That said, if the premise interested you, go for it and form your own opinion. I talked to a high school student who was reading another book in the series and she absolutely loves the series. Don't be afraid to love it. Obviously, there are a lot of people out there who share your opinion. I'm just not one of them. For a cooler female heroine, check out Stuart Hill's Cry of the Icemark.e afraid to love it.

1250038820|5.0|Even though I've been following HONY on FB for over a year, this book was still fresh. The connection with those photographed is so HUMAN, the book brought me some tears, but way more smiles. This is such a heartwarming collection of photos and stories. Buy this book and find a favourite picture if you can! I know I have too many :-)
B007THA4FI|4.0|I liked it very much.  Character study is brilliant and it transfers the feel of the moment in the story very well. I would have liked a little more at the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun and addicting app, suitable for all ages. With around four hundred level you will never get bored. .
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|At some levels, you can seem to get &quot;stuck&quot;, but you do learn as you go.<br />More fun to play among &quot;Friends&quot;.
1250030951|5.0|Some books make you feel like you want to climb inside and live in their worlds - this book made me feel like I'd already lived in this world. Except for the absent mother and the twin, I am the Cather in so many ways. I relate to so much of what she says, does, and thinks. The familiarity is some of the fun of this novel, but the real attraction is Rowell's writing style, which is funny, intimate and clear and contains just the right amount of snark to be charming and clever but not too clever for its own good. I haven't read either of Rowell's previous novels, but based on the strength of this effort alone, I think I can call myself a fan. FYI, this is a must-read for all Potterheads.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Play its fun it will be the best game you ever played before you would have the best time on the game
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'd never read this author before, and entered the book expecting some light hearted chick-lit. This book is a bit more than that. Maybe because I wan't expecting anything deep, I did NOT guess the secret ahead of reading. The tone of the book obviously changes greatly from there, with a complete lack of clear path forward for right vs wrong. What should be traded in any of our conscience? A very interesting premise to challenge how our first judgements
B00DW1WR14|5.0|This is an incredible album. I've grown up with PJ and they always seem to get it right when it comes to the soundtrack of my life. Well worth the money.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love this movie, a statement of many kinds of bravery.  The bravest of all being to take responsibility for your actions and working to set them right.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for all ages. I love it and so does my four-year old niece. Great to play on road trips or waiting for an oil change.
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|After installing it, my battery life went from 2 days, down to less than 3 hours.  And I never opened the program once.  Once I uninstalled it, I got my 2 days of battery life back again.  Seems to have a serious issue with chewing up resources and battery from what I can see.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game makes you think, not just a mindless game. If you think there is ont much of a challenge in games, try this one. Have fun it gets harder as you go.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|but i wish we could stream our own media from our devices to the tv. besides that its good product.
3836538725|5.0|I'm so proud for this book, because Salgado is a Brazilian photographer and the book is wonderful. Only B&W photos around the world, Genesis is a book about nature, people, animals and untouch places of the nature.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|WOW!  Quick read that continues the story of the Torrance family and the effect of the Overloook. I could never have predicted the twists and turns of this book. Highly recommended but re-read The Shining first!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|If you are part of the Zombie nation, regardless of age (I am 64) you will absolutely love this series. Go back and watch the previous seasons and then catch up on season 4, you won't regret it and your kids and grandkids will think you are cool again. You can also talk to them about it and I guarantee you, they are watching it. Pure fun, not recommended for the wee ones. Teenagers and up only please.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I did enjoy this particular episode. Its a good series.<br />The whole process of buying the episode was a little too confusing and not clear instructions about the 2 different prices HD and normal display.
140006922X|5.0|A very scholarly book.  Aslan does not take a religious stand.  He does a good job of giving historical context to the life of Jesus, attempting to distinguish between what is factual and what is faith-based. I had to read it twice, reading the chapter by chapter reference material as I read the text on the second round.  It's not a book that will keep you spell bound, it's very erudite. I read mostly fast-paced fiction, but this was a good break for me.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a nice game. I like the graphics the story line, the three player modes, the music soundtrack. This game is a fun way to kill time. I intend to buy the sequel to this game. I enjoy match three games that challenge you and tell a story along the way. The power ups are cool also which makes the game that more interesting.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Certainly a delightful breath of fresh air!  This has been one of the best series I have seen.  For those of you who like feeling better about having watched a show rather than feeling worse, I highly recommend this show.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My kids told me I should read the books so I did.  I absolutely loved the books and couldn't wait for the movie.  Although there were parts of the movie that differed from the book I still loved this movie.  I re-read Hunger Games and am currently re-reading Catching Fire in anticipation of the movie.  I recommend it highly :)
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|Falls very far short of &#34;the kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; . A disappointment. Very bitty and many characters simply vanished unfinished.
B005LHO274|5.0|I am a student of astronomy and astrophysics, this program is great because it is very comprehensive, has many data on celestial objects, as well as the time that can be viewed from your location all year round, the simulation of the solar system is just great.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|A straight forward take told well. Jack reunites Jack with his old boss General Leon Garber. Really enjoying reading the series in order.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this app... I love to get costumes and my sister and I love to play!! A must get!!! :)
B00499NHLC|5.0|Both Martin Freeman as Watson and Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock are wonderful. I highly recommend this over the horrible series on CBS.
B001BANK32|5.0|Such a suspenseful book. Regardless if you liked the movie or not, the book ends quite a bit differently and is definitely worth the read.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Brings it all together! Lots of action with an ok story line. All the action makes up for the story line.
B003477DVK|4.0|A delightful &#34;coming-of-age&#34; tale involving a boy and his terrier. If you liked Timmy and Lassie, you'll love this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the game but I have some things I want to change. First off the characters are way too expensive and the keys need to come up more often during the games.Second I want the magnet to pickup star multipliers and other things like the pumpkin during halloween. Except that I love the game I can play it all day.
B0081336FO|5.0|Such brilliant writing and acting! We've watched each episode multiple times and catch something new each time.  I can hardly wait for Season 3 to come on in January!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|For some reason it took me a while to read. But it was AMAZING. Been a fan since tres Navarre'
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Really like this game. Glad we were finally able to get it on Kindle fire, plus you can play on or off Facebook.
B006LSZECO|5.0|5+ stars!  I am absolutely in love with this book!<br /><br />The writing was phenomenal, fast-paced, almost lyrical.  Which was such a drastic contrast to the plot - not at all poetic.  But disturbing.  We are taken on a journey of a dysfunctional relationship between Nick and Amy that has more twists and turns, ups and downs than a roller coaster.  We go from loving to hating to loving to hating the characters.  As soon as you think you have &#34;it&#34; figured out, you learn you are wrong.<br /><br />This was so well-written I forgot I was reading fiction.  I live in Missouri, and a few times while reading, found myself thinking a road trip to the places named in the book would be interesting.<br /><br />This is not my normal go-to read.  But I am so glad I took the chance!
B000UUF69A|5.0|Best Ninja Turtle movie yet! Much better than the three live action movies. Like the references they make to the three live action movies.
1400069807|5.0|Our processed food is coming from science experiments owned by large companies that go to any level to stay on top or be the 'best&#34; and make the most money.  These products are not food as we know it.  On these experiments and test, the scientists go for the &#34;Bliss point&#34;.  To acheive the Bliss point, they use Salt, Sugar, Fat and any number of chemicals, processes, etc.  They will go to a great extent to save 1/2 cent or more on a given product because these big companies are all about money and staying on top.  Money is #1.  Actual food is way down the list.<br /><br />Shopping around the perimeter of the store where your meats, fruits and vegetables are is the safest food.  Growing a garden is a must using organic heirloom seed because GMOs are definitely harmful for humans, animals, the planet, etc.  I completely recommend this book for every family so you know how to protect yourself and warn others!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Such brilliant writing and acting! We've watched each episode multiple times and catch something new each time.  I can hardly wait for Season 3 to come on in January!
1563894696|4.0|Frank Miller wasn't a writer here but he didn't need to be. Although the art leaves something to be desired, it was ultimately an enjoyable read with an ending that was actually surprising! Though not worth spending too much money on, I would recommend this mystery novel even today.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the graphics and the star wars theme. The animation is great. Playing this on the kindle makes it even more fun.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This is the second of Larsson's 3 books. Note that while you neeeent have read the previous book, it does enhance the experience, as you've already established a connection to the characters & are instantly interested in the outcome here. The book is an exceptional thriller/crime drama that highlights cyber-crime, espionage, sex trafficking, investigative journalism & the states abuse of power. It is a long & detailed read, which is a Larsson hallmark as the meticulous nature of his writing is what makes the characters so deep. However, don't expect a quick &#34;beach or airplane read&#34;. Definitely worth the time & oh, did I mention the cliffhanging ending????
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I almost put the book down after dragging through the first few chapters. This isn't your happily ever after story. Each chapter switches to another character's story, each one more depressing than the other. I honestly hung in there to finally find out who was responsible for the death of a young girl. This is an &#34;I like it/I don't like it, I like it/I don't like it&#34; kind of story.
B000HL09MG|5.0|Just mesmerizing master work. Want to watch over and over again. Some scenes are so intoxicating and stunningly and beautifully shot.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|I was relatively offended to see such negative reviews on this movie. I enjoyed the plot, story, the father-son acting. My one complaint is Really not a complaint, Karen Smith is kind of a new actor, for his first piece (that I've seen) as a young man he did great. I was on the edge of my seat several times wondering \\"oh crap he's going to die now?!\\" Then Will Smith can do no wrong in my eyes, I don't recall him everhard way directing a film but kudos Will..kudos. overall I would go see it in theaters again in a heart beat, give poor Karen a break and pull your too high expectations aside..it is a film to entertain an  invoke deeper thought about your own survival skills. If you dig much deeper than that you will cheat yourself out o  the experience. I gab  it four stars because while I enjoyed the movie.. I was not a fan of the characters themselves. I understood why they did some things but it didn't ease my frustration. I feel I didn't get to know them
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was great.  I saw it in the theater a while ago and it got me excited to see the second movie coming out in November!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I consider a book \\"good\\" when it interferes with my daily routine.  This book did that and more.  The plot was interesting and the characters nicely developed without being forced.  They had their quirks without being quirky.  I have already read another Moriarty novel and am on my way to becoming a fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVED this game! Spent a cold rainy day playing. Wish there were more levels. Must admit I used the cheat sheet more then once.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, I play on my phone all the time, now I can play on my Kindle Fire too, added bonus it was a free game to download.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is my all time favorite game.  KKKeeps the mind busy<br />and I would recommend any Mahjong game there are so<br />many combinations to pay.
B0038TWHP6|5.0|Michael Collins was a great movie. A very interesting and important story in history told in a very compelling movie! Worth watching.
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|This is &#34;4.&#34; How on earth did they get through 1-3? The only saving moment was when the heroine runs into the street and is almost hit by a car she didn't see coming. The way she spits out &#34;PRIUS!&#34; encapsulates an entire diatribe against cars that don't make noise. Otherwise, shaky cameras and dark lighting cannot save this mess or make it any more scary or clean up any of the loose ends.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I wasn't in the mood for this genre book at the time I started it but the book was recommended and indeed it pulled me in and tangled me up in its plot. I need the next book. Thank you.
B004LUS390|4.0|The app is amazing! My only problem is the brush. The brush should be like the non-full version brush. I have trouble telling where the brush will go because it is always a bit off. Plz fix and I'll give 5 stars!! Awesome app though!!!
B000JQUKKU|4.0|Have read several renditions of this timeless story this is the first that held true to the original publication roof the book
B005HESLUA|5.0|I love all the characters. I used to watch it as a child (when it first came on) and I have fallen in love with it all over again. I love that amazon prime has all the seasons, and I can watch them directly with my xbox. I have not done much the past week due to this show, but oh well. I'm just happy I didn't have to buy all the seasons! Not to mention everything else that you can watch too!

1610457420|5.0|The 5 Love Languages Military Edition by Gary D Chapman & Jocelyn Green is a great book aimed at helping military marriages survive by figuring out how the husband and wife experience love most powerfully. Some people like gifts, others like quality time, acts of services, encouraging words or physical touch. Often couples have very different ways that they like to receive love and if the husband and wife don't realise this then they can feel really unloved despite the best efforts of both parties.<br /><br />This book is an adaption of the very popular \\"The 5 Love Languages\\" book that has been crucial in saving marriages and restoring relationships through its simple but profound ideas. This adaption targets military couples who have the added pressure of being separated for large portions of time and have added strains on their relationship. There are plenty of stories of military couples struggling but helped by understanding what their partner needs to feel loved. There are also several keys and suggestions specific to military situations that will help couples who are struggling with maintaining a strong marriage while spending a lot of time apart.<br /><br />Although this book was not particularly applicable to me, as I am not married yet and I have not in the military, I found it very interesting and I think it will be very helpful when I do get married. I had heard of the love languages before as several friends have read the book and we have had discussions about it but it was good to finally real the source material and fully understand the ideas.<br /><br />The narration is quite good, he sounded a bit like a psychologist or counsellor with a soothing voice and it made to easy to listen and follow along with the stories and ideas.<br /><br />This book would be great for anyone in the military who is married or plans to be married in the future as it contains some helpful information on making it last despite the difficulties. It would also be great for anyone who is married or who plans to get married even if they aren't in the miliatry as the principles are very similar.<br /><br />This audio book was gifted as a part of the christianaudio Reviewers Program in exchange for my unbiased review of this work. More information can be found about this and other Christian audio books at christianaudio.com.

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|good and fun game to play a lot of action in it.I had fun playing this game.I think you will have fun playing this game.
006202406X|4.0|While the ending was something I hoped wouldn't have happened I don't agree with most of the negative comments. The book was still good and remember it was in post war time conflict anything can happen, even to the good guys. However, I felt that the story lacked a little something. It didn't grab me like the other two did, Tris's spy role could have been better, more in-depth and in truer to Tris is personality, she would never be that careless with such a position. I also felt the the relationship between Tris and Four could have been expanded even with the ending as it is. They were extremely in love and I wish that would have played out more.<br />It IS worth reading....you never know there could be another series the book did leave that possibility in a way.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Up to the last two chapters it was easy to understand , the last two very much in the scientific aspect of his experience
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game but I have trouble get the brain but its still fun. Its better than ever enjoy
B001BANK32|5.0|Great read, classic king even decades from when it was originally published, and don't forget to read Dr.Sleep the great sequel
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great show! I wwould definitely recommend it! I can't wait until season 3 becomes free.  I wish all the episodes were available free.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For the kindle hd 8'9  this game is fabulous. The best I have played for the $. Will save to play it again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|ive never cried so much. this book made me question what i want to do with my life. definitely a must-read.
B00BKZUVGM|1.0|Extremely flat, monotone, boring and lack lustre compared to the first two books. Felt like the first 80% of the book was just filler to get us to the contrived final act.
B005HSL626|5.0|The good part about this game is u slice the crap  outta em. Its also fun &amp; games. AWESOMELY AWESOMNESS
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|Not as good as Take Care but still a good release from drake I would wait for the price to drop unless your a big fan
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I will refrain from giving a summary except to say you have no idea you are reading a fantasy until well into the early part of the book. The photos are eerie and lend a feeling of reality to the story. For any reader who has always felt \\"peculiar,\\" in this world, this unusual and haunting book is a must-read.
140006922X|3.0|Aslan seems to have started his book bound to prove that the historical Jesus had no higher calling than that of many other Messiah want-to-bes. Than he interpreted the data to show that Jesus came from a rebellious region and, therefore, must be a anti-roman rebel. That he met John the Baptist and, therefore,  must be simply one of John's disciples, just another failed zealot. Every time he ran into data that suggested Jesus had a higher calling, he dismissed it as made up by Biblical writers determined to start a new religion. A historian shouldn't pick and choose his facts. The book is, however, well written and well documented. It's a good read for someone who can discern.
B009V0TV6O|4.0|UPDATED: Yes, the word \\"Free\\" does appear in the app's title, but it does seem to be full-featured, without limitations. Decent app.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I hate giving this only one star, as it's a decent app. However, this is not the version promised, so it fails on that level. Deleting and re-installing did nothing to change the version (not that it has reason to).
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Not normally what I watch but I was hearing so much about it. I'm hooked. The acting is great and it feels authentic. Unfortunately if this was in the real world they would have all been in jail by now. Lucky for me its not and I look forward to season 7, 8 ,9......
B007LB5MF4|5.0|Is a really good book Its far better then I thought it would be, and held my interest a lot better then the book did. Even though I couldn't but the book down either. I will admit there where times once I did there would be days that I just didn't pick it back up where with the graphic novel I read it everyday. And enjoy following along with the drawings. It's really well done...
B00D7JGL36|5.0|First of all, I love Vince Gill! Any record he makes , I buy.  What else is there to say&#62;
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the movie!  It was very exciting and it held my interest. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its fun and every level changes so its not the same moves every time. Kind of addicting and can't wait to get to new levels.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very cool app. .it's very simple to operate.i would recommend it to any one . best app I will say for a free simple calculator
B000KE1P7S|5.0|You can feel every emotion and nuance in his portrayal. The proposal scene is perfection.<br /><br />Clarke is wonderful as well. the chemistry is powerful between the two actors.<br /><br />I do agree that the quality on the DVD due the film format is difficult to view at times. But the reward of experiencing this version overcomes it.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is an excellent read that brings out issues worth thinking about and, talking about.  The characters are well drawn.  I did not want to put it down.<br /><br />Only down side is that it is a bit predictable.  Anne Dachs
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This app is very entertaining and isn't a frantic gem swap.  With  that said, the waiting time between lives has nearly caused me to delete this game. Tring to force people to buy things is a real turn off.
B00EDPFGMU|5.0|I own all of Drake's albums and I like his other albums, I love this album. It is different from Take Care because it is not as emotional but it just as consistent. You can tell Drake spent a lot of time perfecting this album and he really did a great job. I would recommend this album to Drake fans, hip-hop fans and anyone that enjoys music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVED this book it was sad in a way but also exciting. I thought it was a good book with lots of action and love.

B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|Let me just start off by saying that I am, in fact, in my twenties, and in no way do I claim to know the joys and sorrows of being 30, or, 40, or 50. I'm having a handful living my age.<br /><br />With that announcement, my first impression was: ugh. How old is Bridget?<br /><br />I have read Bridget Jones' diary, books 1 and 2. And when I first read the series, I vaguely compared it to Sex and the City by Candace Bushnell. The parallels were there; single, living in the city, with thoughts about being single, not being married, being able to buy whatever you want but coming home to a dark apartment at 3 AM. Both around the same age. Both apparently not knowing what they want in partners. Even the formats were similar.<br /><br />The ending, of course, differs: Sex and the City ends with the sentence, \\"Mr Big is happily married. Carrie is still happily single\\", while in Edge of Reason, Bridget is clearly starting a new life with Mark Darcy. Bridget is finally settling down, as Carrie is accepting her life that maybe marriage isn't everyone's \\"happily-ever-after\\". I was in my late teens then, trying to have a vague view of what marriage might be like, what it might mean to be single, e.t.c. So it gave two contrasting views from two characters with very similar settings. After all, marriage means you are finally getting out of the unbalanced, unstable, but wildly free phase and into the settle. Like Magda and Bridget's mother, you will now have pasta in jars, children's birthday parties to throw, husband's infidelity worries (in some cases), brioche to bake... you now have to buy clothes for your children, instead of that green shirt at Jigsaw.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years. Bridget has been married. And she still... behaves like she's twenty-five.<br /><br />Now, it's okay if you're 50 and childless and partying every night. Nobody would really care if you ended up with a broken leg and in a hospital because you were out partying at 3 AM, got drunk, and fell ina ditch. Different story if you're with two children; they're going to be hungry. They might need a lift from school. And who's going to wash their clothes? Having a child means you are no longer just responsible for yourself; it also means your life isn't really yours any more, but shared by others, who are completely dependent on you. There's less you, more \\"them\\". Someone in Bridget's situation should not be worrying over \\"Roxter\\"'s age; she has more things to think about. But only in first page she's musing about the benefits of bringing a boy-toy to a party, all the while her daughter's waiting to be picked up and they have no rice cakes, and her son has nits in his hair.<br /><br />She's freakin' 51. She should be more responsible. I know, responsible isn't \\"fun\\", but being a grown-up isn't much about fun anyway. This novel might have been better if Bridget Darcy, nee Jones, was twenty-two, not fifty-one. But as she's double my age, she probably should be more responsible than me.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that as soon as you are a mother, your life is over. But life does change; the focus becomes more \\"child\\", less \\"you\\", and that's how it should be, as it was your choice to have the child, but not the child's to come into this world.<br /><br />I definitely do not want Bridget as my mother, and I'm glad my mother is almost the opposite of Mrs Darcy. It would have been fine with me to see Bridget, with her scatter-brained-ness, trying to raise children with Mark, settling into the role of a housewife, juggling housework and children's education and supporting her husband. But oh no, Bridget's still hopping through beds, ogling at men, worrying about weight, smoking too much... which means she really hasn't grown up in twenty-some years.<br /><br />Bridget should not have gotten married, or have children. And I'm not sure what Mark was thinking... did he actually think, \\"yes, she shall be the mother of my children, and raise them to be responsible adults who pay taxes, possibly get them into Oxbridge as my parents had done\\"? Because if he did, I'd question his ability as a barrister. They're usually good at reading people - that's their job, half the time - and he clearly didn't do such a stellar job on this one.<br /><br />Oh, and one last thing? Hanging onto a man's word at age 18 might be okay. At age 51? So not okay. Bridget, GROW UP.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|its a good movie. much more eventful than the first! its an interesting take on the eva story, makes it easier to digest a lot of the story.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was an entertaining and suspenseful read that kept my attention.  At times it was predictable but the ending made up for that.

0060920084|1.0|While I like Bryson's witty writing, this book is far short of \\"A Walk in the Woods\\".  He takes a long drive on local highways -- except when he feels like taking the Interstate and thereby skipping wide parts of the country. It's an interesting route, but he never gets out of his car to meet people.  He complains about waitresses, motel staff, and shop owners, but I only counted one or two interactions with fellow tourists.  And he never tries to go in-depth with local citizens. I know more about his TV likes/dislikes than the character of people who live in the small towns he passed through.<br /><br />As of 2013 the travelogue is very dated, so some references are no longer relevant, especially prices.  But that's okay, no one expects this to be Fodor's Guide for rural America.<br /><br />If I had a penny for every unnecessary gripe about a town, national park, local people or fellow tourist, I would have the money to take my own trip and do it right.  See you on the road!
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|By now, I would hope someone like Trent Reznor would need no introduction. The man has been making music for decades and Nine Inch Nails definitely left a huge stamp on the industrial scene. After a five year hiatus, I found myself surprised when I saw the announcement for the band’s eighth studio album, Hesitation Marks. Anyone who follows Reznor’s work is aware that he’s been busy with other projects, but the return of NIN felt a little sudden to me.<br /><br />It’s not something I do often, but I decided to steer clear of the singles until the full album was released. I was expecting a musical change due to the changes in Reznor’s personal life, and I wanted to hear it as a complete package. Well, in that regard, Hesitation Marks doesn’t disappoint. Similar to the band’s past work, this new offering is very unique and it provides a different outlook on Reznor has a human being. For one, there isn’t as much angst and pessimism in his lyrics. There’s still some dark themes, but it’s definitely more tame this time around.<br /><br />In my opinion, one of the album’s biggest accomplishments is also one of its biggest flaws. From start to finish, Hesitation Marks is very diverse in terms of how these songs sound. At times, I found that some songs resembled his part work, but then there were times where the music sounded like something else entirely. For example, track five, “All Time Low,” sounds like a weird fusion of Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral, but the album’s second single, “Copy of A,” sounds like Nine Inch Nails for the modern age. Then there’s track seven, “Everything,” which has an unusual Pop Punk-ish vibe.<br /><br />Truthfully, all of the songs on Hesitation Marks have this weird modern spin that usually work well within the context of the album itself. It took some getting used to, but I have to admit that I’m starting to come around to it. They’re not all gems, of course, but I understand the change and I’m adapting. However, this is definitely going to divide the fanbase. While it may be true that this has been happening for years, the end result is going to be much more dramatic when compared to past releases.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is where most of my enjoyment stopped. Majority of my distaste for this album came from Reznor’s lyrics — or his delivery of said lyrics. Aside from a few exceptions, almost all of the songs on Hesitation Marks are plagued with weak and/or forgettable writing. It should be noted, though, that there were a few songs that managed to impress me for their entire running time. For example, I really enjoyed “I Would For You” and “While I’m Still Here” — “Copy of A” also has some extremely catchy lyrics — but then there were others like “All Time Low” which had great verses, but suffered form a weak chorus.<br /><br />Track ten, “Running,” would have to be the biggest example of wasted potential. Sonically the song is a blast to listen to and it actually has the complete package in terms of lyrics — that bridge is insane! However, there’s only one verse. After the first verse is finished you basically get to hear the chorus repeated over-and-over and it becomes excruciatingly repetitive. Then there were other songs like track track six, “Disappointed,” which were brought down by Reznor’s vocal delivery. I don’t know what it was, but every time that song came on it made my skin crawl. It was extremely annoying.<br /><br />Standout Songs: &#34;Various Methods of Escape,&#34; &#34;I Would For You&#34; & &#34;In Two&#34;<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - Truthfully, I don’t think I’ve ever been this indecisive about a score I’ve given to something. As you could tell, Hesitation Marks is definitely a mixed bag. It suffers from some terrible inconsistency, but there’s still some enjoyment to be had here if you give it an honest listen. This is probably Reznor’s roughest work to date, but it still feels like a Nine Inch Nails album and that counts for something, right?
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|i love this game but I it takes so long to load and sometimes doesnt even load then i have to delete it and reinstall which brings me back to the beginning of the game. Nothing gets saved!!!! :)

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's character development is so rich.  I was deeply drawn into the heart of each character.

I feel more open and more sympathetic to people and cultural differences.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I was enthusiastically looking forward to reading the sequel to one of Stephen Kings scariest books, The Shining.  I was hoping he had captured the essences of his earlier book.  I enjoyed the first few chapters of Doctor Sleep the most, as it takes place shortly after the horrifying experiences at the Overlook.  Once Danny Torrence is grown, he seems so similar to most of Mr. Kings hero's in numerous novels, that I almost forgot I was reading about Danny Torrence.  Oh, there are references to The Shining to remind me it was the same character, but it seems like Dan (now grown, no more Danny), isn't very different from many of Mr, Kings heroes.  The book was pretty slow during the first half, and it did pick up steam (pun intended if you read the book), toward the end, but I was rolling my eyes with the amount of characters that have the \\"shine\\" in them.  This was more like an adventure story and not the horror story that Steven King promised.  I feel it would have been a much better novel, if he stayed with the \\"ghost\\" aspects of the original and not make this to be a Shining war.  Oh yes, there are a few ghosts, but not to many and nothing that was the least bit scary.  If the Overlook had been rebuilt and Dan Torrence would have returned there...now that would be interesting.  Although Dan does return to the location of the original Overlook, it just seemed to be a \\"carrot\\" to hold our interest in the book.  It didn't make sense as to why the True Knot chose this as their campsite.<br /><br />I am an avid Stephen King fan.  I have every first edition, first print of every book he's written (many with his signature), but I'd say this book is average at best.  It's not a bad book, it just didn't live up to the hype.  It's worth a read, but don't set your expectations to high.  If you want to read something recent, by Stephen King, I'd suggest 11/22/63, that was very good.  I really hope Mr. King can find that dark place that used to scare the bejeebies out of me..as I haven't seen that since Pet Sematary.  If you are looking for a great Halloween read by Mr. King, read Salem's Lot, that one had me up at night.  Mr. King is an incredible writer and like most writers, every book can't be great.  This one is good.  I haven't given up.  Mr. King, let's see some of your earlier magic in your next book.s I haven't seen that since Pet Sematary.

0399165274|2.0|Too loaded with the technical organization and relationships of a variety of US and Near Eastern intelligence agencies and responsibilities staffed by people with totally unpronounceable Near Eastern names and affiliations. The story is buried somewhere in all of this distraction so that it gets lost in the process.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You will feel depressed a lot of times reading this book, but in an intriguing can't-stop-biting-my-cuticles-even-though-it-hurts kind of way. Definitely worth the read, especially as its now being turned into a movie. The writing and the twists are BRILLIANT!
1907698892|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1U1AP68AUV45Y]]<br />A PRACTICAL AND ACCESSIBLE GUIDE TO ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED ON FEES IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Criminal lawyers dealing with legally aided clients will welcome this latest third edition of `Fixed Fees in the Criminal Courts' recently published by the Law Society. Here in one compact volume (as the Law Society explains) is `all the critical information, codes and fee tables you need to deliver bills for legally aided criminal cases in the police station, Magistrates' and Crown Courts.'<br /><br />Note that this new edition covers only work conducted on or before 1 April 2013. In respect of work conducted before this date the author recommends that you refer to earlier editions of this guide and to the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) manual.<br /><br />In view of the new material it contains, acquiring this new edition should be considered an imperative for criminal practitioners. To cite only a few examples, the book offers advice regarding the changes under the standard crime contract and reductions in rates -- and also covers changes made to magistrates' court claims and to the definition of page count in the Crown Court.  Then there are the new rules for claims for separate matters in the police station.  Note too, the new rules for advocates and the developing controversy over flat payments of the same fee whether the matter is a plea or goes to trial.<br /><br />Certainly the scope of the book is appropriately wide.  Over its ten chapters, it provides concise coverage of such matters as criminal investigations, Magistrates' Court proceedings, appeals and reviews, prison law and work at the Crown Court. These and specifically the chapters on, for example, disbursements and administrative issues focus upon and largely clear up the usual uncertainties of what you can - and cannot - charge for.<br /><br />Dealing with all fixed and graduated fee schemes, the book is fully referenced to the relevant case law -- and there are over thirteen appendices which include litigators' and advocates' graduated fee tables and experts' fees and rates.<br /><br />Written by an acknowledged expert in this field, this is the definitive work on what has always been a complex subject and in recent years has become more so, following the numerous changes in fees for criminal cases.  If you or your colleagues practice in the criminal courts, this is a must-have acquisition for your library.duated fee schemes, the book is fully referenced to the relevant case law -- and there are over thirteen appendices which include litigators' and advocates' graduated fee tables and experts' fees and rates.<br /><br />Written by an acknowledged expert in this field, this is the definitive work on what has always been a complex subject and in recent years has become more so, following the numerous changes in fees for criminal cases.

159463176X|2.0|Having read all of his books this one was not interesting. Very confusing story line. Many names that most people who are not from the Afghanistan region cannot pronouce. It became difficult to decipher the cast of charactors and where they were at any given time.  I had to give up as the challenge of trying follow the story line became tiresome.  His previous books were without a doubt exquisite.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I have watched and enjoyed the series since episode 1. I look forward to many more episoges in this series and will probably buy them as they become available
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Not what I expected, but a lot better. Joe is the kind of man any woman would want around them.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I appreciated Dr. Aslan's scholarship. At the same time, he does write from the perspective of a Muslim who sees Jesus as a prophet, not as the Son of God or divine. Most Christian scholars are unable to look at alternative explanation or data.<br /><br />I agree with Aslan that Jesus was a zealot, that James was likely the blood brother of Jesus, and that both the Canon of the Christian scriptures and Nicean Creed were political documents.<br /><br />His book does give one pause on what were the goals of Jesus, to reform Judaism or start a new religion?<br /><br />I recommend this book for biblical scholars and for people like me that have serious questions about the historical Jesus.
0143034901|5.0|I like the style of writing. A deep book but quite interesting. I have read 3 of his books. A bit strange but the mystery is great !!
1476734941|4.0|This book has great tips on cutting calories while eating delicious, light meals. I saw this guy on Rachel Ray and I was sold on this book!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was looking for a &#34;light read&#34; for a long car ride and this book fit the bill.  It held my interest, and the story was wrapped up very well.  I am now reading another book by Liane Moriarty!
B0026JWDQW|2.0|Wish I would have chosen a different cd. I enjoy his sound but overall, this cd had very few songs I would want to hear again. :(
B00C1S945G|5.0|Not sure why people dislike this season, we love it! The characters develop and plot lines form that last through the remainder of the series.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show just gets better and better.  The writers are really good and I enjoy the twists and turns of every episode.
006220629X|5.0|I read this book with no knowledge of the author. But was entranced in the first few pages. Turned out to be a great book. Made me anxious to read another one of his.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have always loved this CD. Mariah Carey is awesome. The CD has always cost a lot ( $15 ). So when it was $9.00 I had to get it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a highly addictive game, but lots of fun.Just have enough will-power to take a break sometime and not go overboard. Enjoy.
0425263924|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book although I thought it was only going to be a trilogy...Now I have to sit and wait for the next book but I know it will be worth the wait
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game...it fun to play and pass your friend on the level that they cant pass.....more people should play this game cuz it fun and it make you mad when you can pass the level but you keep trying again and when you pass the level it feels so good and proud that you just pass the level and your friend who cant pass where they are at....
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Will help you win the game. Good for doctor's waiting rooms, dmv lines, and the coffeehouse. Beware the random volume levels..sometimes it is really loud.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best app in along time for the Kindle Fire!!!! So far so good app working GREAT with the Kindle Fire.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|The swivel sweeper has made my life much easier. I have tile floors, so now instead of using a dust mop or broom, I use the swivel sweeper.
B005OL7Z30|5.0|you are making it too hard to review.  I know you are looking for quality but this sucks.  Because now I have to type this to qualify.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Its actually a pretty great game with lots of fun robots to choose from like zeus, atom, noisy boy and others. Its also has an almost endless amount of fighting . The only thing that annoys me is the energy which is only 5 and you need to wait 15 freaking minutes to get 1 energy but other than that its a great game. Right now I have 4 robots and my current one is noisy boy
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Love these! Couldn't stop reading and when I had to I couldn't stop thinking about it!!! The infatuation between these two is something most people dream of having in a relationship!!!
0321928482|5.0|This book contains a different approach on how to use Lightroom 5. There are several new features pointed out to the user of the book not covered in Kelby and several other books on the market. When you think you know Lightroom from other training books on the subject there seems to be something new you did not know. The Book is well written and easy to understand and follow, but does sometimes need you to look around Lightrooms interface to follow the book. Over all very good book.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game very enjoyable<br />I have had and still do have a lot of fun with this app<br />Well I think you should get it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and I really love this game. We take turns playing it at home after he's done with his homework.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I payed for this game and played it. Put it in the cloud and brought it back to play again it wantes me to pay again. Wrong!!!!!!
0307341577|3.0|The author grabbed the audience in a very detail oriented way but it was a bit too gruesome for me... If you like a bit of a thriller and like being taken from present to past and back (over and over again), then this may be the book for you.
B00C5R8364|5.0|No spoilers here. If you like Forsyth you will like this. If you haven't tried Forsyth this will get you started (but be sure to read the Day of the Jackal too), An excellent action/adventure novel and a great air travel read for a long flight.
B00AYE8C70|4.0|Works great between portable devices however I have not been able to get it to work between my Mac and a I-Phone overseas.<br />Reported this to Viber and Their answer did not help or make any sense to me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put this book down. The characters were incredibly well developed.  I felt as if I was in the story. Really does make a person contemplate how fate changes our life path. Great read.
B008JFUPZI|3.0|I watched this movie while thinking, \\"are they copying MIB  but dead people instead of aliens\\"? And sure did looked like it. It wasn't the best movie ever but also wasn't the worst, it just took some wrong turns in the plot that just couldn't been fix even by a great writer. I would suggest renting this movie and watching it on a Saturday night but just watch it and forget you're in a rollercoaster. I would suggest watching The internship instead.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a big fan of Stephen King and he proves himself over and over. It was great finding out what happened to Danny and that he does a &#34;pay it forward&#34;.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I won't lie.  I was disappointed by the ending.  I don't think it did the characters justice.  I won't say anymore so I don't give anything away.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I can recommend this series for any sci fi lover. Oh yeah, some of it is predictable and sometimes the special effects are a little cheesey, but the story line is good and the actors seem to be really into it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Wasnt sure what to expect, being that I'm such a big fan of the shining. But Stephen comes through with a great story. Not the same level of fright, but page turning suspense.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|I've got to admit I haven't been a beach boys fan for too many years, but, 3 years are good enought for a 19 year-old. From the moment that I've heard Pet Sounds I knew that I was listening to something good, and lucky me, a few months later The SMiLE Sessions was announced for November 2011. I've tried to buy it from amazon but unfortunately, the package was lost (probably stolen) since its quite difficult to ship anything to Argentina. Anyway, I decided to wait for a couple of months until I went to New York and I finnally bought it. I was very happy. I putted the disc 1 on my discman (yes, I do have a discman, it works and it was very helpfull to the ocation), and I surrender to the sound.<br /><br />The box has a LOT of very good things, from information about every single tape, to the amazing Heroes and Villians single. I've listened to the whole sessions maybe twice, and every time I play some parts of it I'm still amazed. You really feel in the studio with this guys. So, ther you have my five stars. Music is unbeliavable and the package its amazing too. The 3D cover really shocks you and its for sure one of the best boxes I've ever seen.
B004U8VX2M|1.0|I did not enjoy this ... the acting is poor... it has a story line that seemed a bit troubling to me; and a bit too dark.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Its a great book...<br />It helps us to lead d rest of our lives easily without any kind of meaningless, hopeless worries....<br />It helps us to love ourselves the way we are nw...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The third series was well done and interesting but of course considering the way it ended I'm wondering if they are winding down the entire season. But it was a good show.
B0025YKDJC|4.0|I love Jim Carrey and he makes me laugh everytime but this also has a real life application.  Just say &#34;Yes&#34; to everything and see the world open up.  I rented this for my 93 yo father the other night so that he might start to say &#34;yes&#34; more than his standard old foggy &#34;no&#34;.  Guess what?  The next day he took his first picture with my iPhone!  He had a pretty big smile on his face after he did it too.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a highly addictive game for anyone who loves to solve mysteries.  The clues are tricky but not so hard to solve that it becomes discouraging.  You will have to make yourself put this game down to get anything else done with your day!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I could play candy crush 24/7 lol I love this game I play it all of the time love love love it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Simply LOVE these series and have watched them over and over.... I can't wait until the 4th season begins in January.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|On the advice of a friend, I started catching up on DA while on vacation.  I raced through all three seasons in no time with the sound of the DA theme song going through my head.  I love the whole story line and am intrigued with every plot and nuance that goes on.  The acting is superb!  And the scenery just adds to the overall enjoyment of the story.  I'm looking forward to season 4 and hope there are many more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've waited so long for this game to be available on the Kindle Fire. So excited and so addicted to this game!
B0063GORYU|5.0|A bit too easy at first. Learn the tricks on the single suit games and then get sucked in to an enjoyable challenge.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Veronica should be ashamed of her ending. She sacrificed her story and the characters we cared about, especially Tris, just for shock value. I'm pissed I put time and emotion into this series. Why would we want to see Tris have to go through so much crap and then never get her place with those she loved at the end?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was playing this game on my husband's IPad, so I was hoping it would come to Kindle. Now, it's time for Pet Saga!!!!!
B0014H32MG|4.0|I really liked this book.first Stephen king book I've read. This one actually got me to start reading the long walk. Hope it's as good
0470901071|5.0|I had no experience with anything related to networking, subnetting, routing, or anything.  This book is written in such a format that I was able to learn rapidly.<br /><br />The book is being used in Introduction to networking at University of Houston-Clear Lake, and Jian Lin uses the textbook well.  Maybe it's just the professor, but I feel the book is easy to read, use as a reference, and makes learning easy.<br /><br />The end of Chapter questions are difficult, but all the answers are included at the end of each chapter (explaining the reasons for the answer and why the incorrect answers are incorrect).  I understand that the CCNA Certification isn't easy so hopefully studying this book will make it easier.
0143119680|5.0|Just finished reading the second book in this trilogy, and it was as good as the first book. Waiting on the final installment to come out in January 2014.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I love it! So different. Its nice to listen to the words a get something relavant or touching out of it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is not for people who get frustrated easily, or are stupid...sorry. It makes you think and is more challenging than most games. I just wish there were more levels!
B008QLXSG8|5.0|It's a masterpiece. One of the most fascinating characters I've ever read, the pace of the book falls in perfectly. Don't miss it for anything
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy Candy Crush has come to Kindle.  It does freeze occasionally but no more than it does on my PC.
B00746O3X8|2.0|i used it for once, never use it again. the belt is really difficult to adjust,and the screw on the camera is so ready to loosen. when it is lossen, it will stuck in the holder.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We sat down expecting a very good movie, and when you expect something from a movie it most of the time falls short of your expectations. Not with this one, it was better then we were told, action packed but yet had a very caring effect too, made me cry a few times.  We cannot wait till Hunger Games 2 comes out, I hope we are not expecting to much out of this one.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very well written. Hard to put it down. Easy to implement in daily life. Open your mind, heart, soul, and reap the rewards! Enjoy!

B00AF82WTO|5.0|Every time i watch this movie i fall in love, i feel every emotion, a most wonderful story by Jane Austen. If i am ever to become a writer i wish to write like her. Captain Wentworth and Miss Anne Elliott are in my heart forever. Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry Jones i would love to see together in other movies...ChrisMacias...: )
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I love this movie, and the shipment arrived on time :) I have yet to open it, because I want to see it with my mom (she's been really busy.)<br />The case looks undamaged and new.<br />I'm very satisfied.

8866135887|2.0|When searching for a planner, I had three main criteria in mind - lightness, durable, and user-friendly. The 2013-2014 Moleskine definitely meets the first two points. It's sturdy, not too heavy, and won't unbind after heavy usage (an issue with another planner). However, whoever designed this Moleskine product favored chic-ness, over the end-user. For example, the month is located on the upper right-hand corner of the paper of the left-side page. So it's difficult to tell what month I am looking at unless I fully open the planner i.e., I can't easily find a specific date. (this is hard to describe, but hopefully I can upload a picture.) Basically, you can't tell what month you're looking at - ever. It's a horrible layout!<br /><br />Also, I like to have month-at-a-glance pages that shows a calendar-style view of the month so I can write all major deadlines and events. Moleskine doesn't give you that option. The entire month of October, for example, is condensed to one column, on a 1/2 page. Each day of the week get a 1/2 line. How am I to write multiple events that occur on the same day? I have 2 projects due and a birthday party. Should I buy a monthly planner to complement the weekly planner? That seems like a waste.<br /><br />Maybe this planner isn't intended for graduate students or those that have very varied schedules.<br /><br />The best planner I had was a Greenroom one from Target; however, the binding falls apart and Target only sells it twice a year - summer before the academic year starts and around New Year.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|This album is Katy's best and it's the best POP album ever. As many know katy is a singer/song writer and has a talent for writing #1 hit songs and just like her previous album 'teenage dream' this album is full of potential hit songs.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun to burn time fast. Worth your time. Good program for Kindle. Awesome game for the off season. Fun for the kids.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I love it so much I could play it all day long don't wait just get it  now you will thank me.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|I now live in Wisconsin but I grew up in Muscle Shoals (MSHS 1978). I was just ahead of Ricks son in high school. I though I knew a lot about the music and about Rick Hall, I did not. This movie is so well done. I plan on buying the dvd and having a  showing at our house. If you love music then I believe you will love this movie. It has so much heart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game fun to play even thought i been stuck on same level for days would highly reccomend even thought it gets frustrating.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A game once started is hard to stop even if it takes days to pass .some are tricky others easy my nemesis was level 147 .
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|GREAT GAME, I HAVE NOT PUT IT DOWN SINCE I GOT IT,I PLAY WITH IT ON MY LUNCH BREAK, AND AS SOON AS I GET HOME
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|It was awesome!!! It had great acting except for a few scenes and the whole concept of it was terrific! The story line was perfect. I would definitely suggest you renting/buying it!!!
B000JMKO3C|4.0|This was a good read. It makes you think about the value of life. I think it opened my mind.
B003Y7PM5E|5.0|This is an original score from Eddie Vedder. The music fit the movie so well, and really enhanced the experienced. On it's own, this is an amazing acoustic album. If you like Eddie Vedder, this is a must-have. My favorite song on the album is Society; it really captures the idealism of the protagonist in into the wild.
B00EO4SBSG|1.0|First off, let me just post this quote from Amazon's Editorial Reviews section for this album - \\"Trivium present their 6th album - definitely one of their heaviest.\\" Are you kidding me?! Is everyone else listening to a different Vengeance Falls album than I am?! This is most definitely their softest album!<br />Listening through this, I think it's become painfully obvious that Trivium is just using a formula to pump out songs. The instruments are forgettable. The only song that stood out to me was the first, Brave This Storm, but in all honesty, this song is just 'alright' and if it was on any previous album I wouldn't give two s***s about it (well, might have been acceptable on their last album, In Waves). Matt's vocals go from soft, to very soft at the climaxes. Why can't we have vocals like that found in The Crusade? Matt's vocals then were excellent. There was almost no screamo yelling (which made up a majority of their first albums) or this soft whining crap that he keeps doing now. He had found a middle ground that showcased his voice and I could listen to again and again. And the lyrics? The lyrics in all his previous albums were solid; even though there were some songs that sounded strange, most were pretty good. But the lyrics in Vengeance Falls are super simple and meaningless. The only ones that have any weight behind them were already used in previous albums. Brave This Storm, yeah, song title and almost all the lyrics seem to be rehashed from previous albums.<br />The only good found in Vengeance Falls was blatantly copy and pasted from work that they've already done. Everything new is awful. The entire band has run out of ideas and are just grabbing at straws. If they put out another album like this, I'm going to swear off Trivium. You better learn from your mistake here, guys.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love love love love love it. Perfect. Game does not cheat you. It's fair. There can always be a way to earn money and gems.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|awesome new album! i love all the songs on the CD. Backstreet back alright. I love Show 'Em What You're Made Of<br />and Trust Me and Breathe.
0345803485|3.0|I don't understand the buzz on this book. I was curious about it... however, after getting a few chapters in, decided that it wasn't for me. There are far better ways to stimulate chemistry.
B00FX8FY14|5.0|Love this song.Not a song that I will get tired of listening to.First heard this song while doing my mile walk and couldn't wait to get home to purchase it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|There will be spoilers so if you have no finished please do not read unless you do not care for spoilers.  I finished this book around 11pm last night, crying through the last 20 minutes.  I really did like the book up until the ending because well I become devastated when a book does not end the way I want it to in my mind.  I am one of those people who become a part of the characters especially my favorite ones.<br /><br />I think that the way this book was written letting you get inside of Tris and Tobias was fabulous because I like him just as much as I like her and felt this helped to get to know his mind better and how he really feels and why he makes the choices he makes even when you are like WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT???? So to get to the point I had been looking forward to reading this book for a long time, ever since I finished the others for the first time (I have read them multiple times since)and even though I was disappointed in how it ended I have to give to to Veronica this is probably one of the only books/series I have read, and I read a lot, that seems to be like things happen in real life.  Tris and Tobias' relationship was not perfect and they loved each other for all of their flaws and good parts.  The part where Tris makes the comment about thinking once you fall in love she used to think the rest just happened but now she realizes that it is not because there are not other people out there for them but they both continue to choose each other day after day and thats what really makes their love is the best description of love I have ever heard.<br /><br />I think that the way the book ended may have been the way it needed to end for Caleb and Tris to be okay because had he truly done what he was planning to do I dont think she would have been able to forgive herself and that may have altered who she could be when it was all over.  This helped him to know she really forgave him, it just killed me for Tobias because she really didnt want the resultthat happened in the end but didnt anticipate David being there waiting.  I was super sad for it to end but it was a change to not have a book end in the way everyone would think and instead have a more real life ending because as we all know life is not perfect.  This series will be missed and I do look forward to the movies but it will be hard watching knowing how it ends.  Thanks for a great series.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The book ended but there was really no good plot line in it at all. It was all just facts about the city's and experiments. Just read the first two and think up your own ending it will probably be better than the one in the book anyway.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great acting and interesting topics.  It makes you want to move on to the next episode and can't wait to start Season 2
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Had his awhile and still love it, It's not just all good wit defending and upgrading that's great, everything has personality even sound is well done. Every enemy is different in defending plus there's cool easter eggs on alot of levels to find out like the level wit ice and the big cave that spider comes out has a little raped up Frodo from lord of the rings that u tap to release him and get a achievement for doing watch is cool . Lot more on different things u may find love the game ,I been waiting and waiting for kingdom rush frontiers to come on Amazon app store wish it do some cause everything about this game is great!<br /><br />Note.. just before I wrote this review on this there was a update were the open game button would be, I updated it and it dL it again so I'll find out what the update is when I play it .
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|It will grow on you, I needed at least 10 plays before I started to like it.  Another 10 to love it.  Now I'm at >50 plays, definitely worth the purchase.
0316204366|5.0|As a marketer I was curious to review Gladwell's latest effort, David & Goliath to see if this might evoke an epiphany for me in the business, in the way The Tipping Point did.  For those expecting a marketing textbook, they might be left wanting.  No such cases studies of how Hush Puppies shoes was able to become cool again. His book showed less research, rather many stories - dozens' of stories from the far past to modern day.  Mostly, they are stories of everyday individuals who have overcome extraordinary disadvantages or adversity.  For example, David Boies, who became a brilliant attorney despite his dyslexia.  There was also an account on Wilma Derksen and how she dealt with the violent murder of her thirteen year old daughter.<br /><br />As advertisers, we love stories.  We love them, because we remember them.  They cause us to identify with the message at a personal level.  And such is Gladwell's craft of storytelling that they provide a persuasive medium to get his ideas across.<br /><br />Gladwell's David and Goliath deserves to be on your bookshelf or Kindle library if only to remind you that success is so much more sweeter when beating the odds.<br /><br />I wrote a fuller review for Ad Age ...

B002ZJCQT2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The author did a great job of providing the big picture of modern physics without having to resort to very much math.  I'm an engineer and so have taken several high school and university-level physics courses; I believe that I and my fellow students would have benefited from first reading this book, before the big picture was, if not lost, obscured by the oft times difficult math associated with modern physics.  Teaching physics through conversations with Emmy the dog was genius!  I would recommend this book to high school and beginning college students who are about to take physics and anyone who is interested in physics without wanting to wade through the gore math details.

B003I87O2I|1.0|Some singers just can't be replaced. Steve Perry is one.  Lou Gramm is another.  Mick Jones may have written the bulk of Foreigner's hit songs, but it was Lou that really brought them to life with his fiery, passionate vocals.  This latest album is watered down junk, not even better than the other Gramm-less CD \\"Unusual Heat.\\"  Kelly Hansen might be a decent singer, but he'll always been standing in the shadows of Lou Gramm.  No matter how much poseur posturing he does, he'll never reach the heights of Lou.

B00B5JVXYC|2.0|This game is only hard because the how to play doesn`t explain it very well. Though if you are willing to put the time and effort into figuring it out it will be quite easy.
B00F5F0208|5.0|This is my first of drakes Album.  It has captured his sounds.  And since so many people liked it..  I liked it too.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|After watching all the previous seasons of Dexter, I have to say that this season was probably the worst of all.  The Brain Surgeon was a weak villain, the subplot with Zach was lame, and the finale was ludicrous.  It's as if the writers just ran out of steam.
B00004XQ83|5.0|After my wife and I watched the film on the big screen, it was a given, that we wanted the cd.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|If you hate sad endings, don't read this. To author: please, publish a book that is a GOOD ending to an amazing series. It's just like the Hunger Games trilogy, the first book was amazing, the second was okay, and the third was horrible because of its sad ending.
B002OKGJUO|5.0|Such a masterpiece of death and life, and redemption. Make sure you watch it till the end. Silent yet Powerful.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I AM VERY UNHAPPY THAT THIS GAME IS UNABLE TO CONNECT TO FACEBOOK, KEEPS TELLING ME NO ACCESS TO THE KINGDOM...WHAT IS GOING ON? I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVELS...PLEASE FIX!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the best puzzle game I have ever played  I hope they come out with more like this one
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I am unable to give a review of this game I don't own it, I do not play Bingo, it does not keep the mind busy enough for me.  I only play changeable games.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|We had fun taking turns doing pictures. This way the whole family can enjoy doing the puzzles together.Try it out.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Hey we have the first 2, it wouldn't be complete with out the 3rd. Robert does such a great job being so serious. Just makes it even funnier.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|This isnt the original bourne guy or even have to do with bourne the character, but actually tells the background story of all the movies, and puts the stories to the end, well kinda
B008P9M614|5.0|It was everything I was expecting and wanting. I was very pleased with making this purchase especially for the price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is now on the Kindle Fire.  Thank you for get to getting it on it.  Very good graphics and sound.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I consider myself only a 'casual' superhero fan, meaning that I have never read or plan to read comic books. Instead, I just watch all the animated films and television shows and swoon over how awesome fictional men in tights kicking butt are.<br /><br />When Batman: Under the Red Hood came out in 2010, it somehow slipped under my radar. But I spotted it on Amazon Instant Video and decided it was about time. I definitely wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />On the aesthetic side, this movie is amazing - the animation is smooth and fluid but doesn't direct attention to itself, meaning that it complements the story rather than overwhelming it. Watching Batman and Nightwing battle together at the beginning of the film was epic; they're comfortable around each other, and it shows in the way they anticipate and build off each other's moves. I remember in particular the long arching shots of them swinging through the air after Batman's line gets cut and Nightwing catches him... that part just about made me pee my pants because of how well it was rendered.<br /><br />As far as plot, it was just as exceptional, though I can't really summarize without giving everything away. This is probably the best in the Batman animated collection so far. Even if you know nothing about Jason Todd and Red Hood, if you enjoy Christian Bale gurgling through a 10 minute scene, then you will learn to prefer these guys, trust me. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (Batman and the Joker from the animated series) aren't present here, which made me kind of sad at first, but once the story got going that didn't even matter. John Dimaggio did an excellent job as an older, but still crazy !@#$#!$ insane sociopath, and Bruce Greenwood was an excellent heartbroken, guilty father-figure. The dueling feelings of heartbreak and hate that goes on here are masterful, and actors play it well.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|So much goes on that it's nice to go back to refresh. I would suggest this for anyone who loves stories.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Alot of the humor etc. is geared toward senior citizens or over 50. Funny parts and lots of good action, Bruce Willis is one of the greatest actors, just old
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game make a second one if you do its going to be amazing everybody you have to hsve this gsme
0763660531|1.0|I really wanted to like this book.  My son 6 yr old loves picture books.  However, he flipped through the book before I had a chance and came to me telling that there were scary parts in the book.  The things that scared him was the little girl was up in a hot air balloon all by herself... o.k. not so bad.  Then we continued on and there is this bird that soldiers are going after with a net and the soldier in the back is pointing a gun.  Once they catch the bird they put it in a cage on some sort of flying machine... the soldier is still pointing the gun at the bird even though it is in the cage.  They take the bird somewhere and it is now being guarded by men with spears.  The little girl runs up and snatches the cage and frees the bird.  Well the girl is in trouble now because the soldiers have captured her and put her in a big \\"bird cage\\" that is suspended in mid-air.  Then they take her crayon and throw it off the flying ship into mid-air, leaving her hopelessly trapped in this cage. Yes, the bird then magically appears with the crayon and everything works out...  Take what you want from this, but its not what I envisioned when I read all the other reviews of how great this book was for any age child. Mine's going back.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Best Stephen King book in a while. Couldn't put it down.  Kept my interest high with Stephen Kings fantastic plots and storytelling. So sorry to get to the end.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|Saw this movie with my girls. So I had to have my own. Love John as a woman. So funny.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You have to admit, there are some shocking revelations in Season 3. It still holds up in the personable actors and fantastic storylines.
0307592731|5.0|Oh to be in Cheryl's shoes when she hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. I cannot imagine doing this trail alone, and in the emotional state Cheryl was in and applaud her for her great achievement. Heartwarming, bittersweet and yet calming - as you read this new beginning on her life and share her stories of her adventures on the trail. A must read for anyone who loves the outdoors and is going through hardship of their own. Highly recommend - I read this book in 3 days!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Best book I have ever read.<br />Each chapter is thought provoking with all characters playing their part of the symphony to complete the story.
B00542USJW|5.0|This came out when my oldest was young. She loved it.I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Has just enough adult humor in it.
B00F35BV64|3.0|This movie is cool graphic wise and the story line is good, not like original show, thank god. Just felt the first was better, kinda hope there isnt a third honestly
B008ZDC7M8|1.0|I am surprised that the BFI sponsored this project as it's terrible.  It's not only difficult to understand the narrator but the content is impressionistic and filled with poorly made contemporary restagings that simply pad the narration.  For example, a commemorative plaque that once belonged to Edison is shown and discussed rather than another example of an Edison short.  Similarly, the discussion of editing in Early Cinema uses as an example another poorly made scene of a contemporary woman in an underpass looking straight at the camera. It looks like a home video made by someone with no production skills.  To complement these poorly made scenes, the narrator rambles about \\"gorgeous photography and cross-cutting\\" and the magic of cinema but gives no context and draws from examples outside of the period discussed.  For example the Early Cinema section features some clips from Edison, Pathe, and Melies, but also makes strange and unmotivated comparisons to examples from contemporary cinema and various national cinemas.  The narrator occasionally has some good insights (especially when it pertains to women directors and screenwriters) but for the most part it comes across as jumbled and impressionistic.  There are also many mistakes (wrong dates, unsubstantiated claims, and misinformation).  Do not recommend.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Like many others, I downloaded this app and noticed when I installed it that it said Creative Metronome Free. After calling Amazon, I downloaded the actual free version to see if I had the real thing or not.  The free version actually has a notification that appears after the metronome has sounded for a couple of measures.  The notification says that the free version will only play the first two measures.  The paid app doesn't do that, so I can assure anyone who wants to know that the fact that the app installation (and even the app itself), although it does say Creative Metronome Free, it is in actuality the paid app.  Just thought I tell you all that.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The book was amazing, but I can't call it much of an ending, because it was bittersweet. The series is great for teenagers from middle to high school. Thanks, Veronica Roth, for helping me to find an amazing story in this book, and to always be brave!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I CRIED my eyes out at the end. I mean i balled like a baby and im 15. I fell in love with all the characters. The end was just heart breaking. I loved this book. More importantly i loved this series.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|cavemen with all kinds of temporary and ridiculous humor, this movie is super funny with all the kooky characters. Watch it more than once to catch some things
B008LHDEH0|4.0|&#34;Something feels weird.&#34;<br /><br />Shadow should be feeling pretty good. He's about to finish a three-year stretch in the joint and be reunited with his wife for a couple of days of non-stop lovin' and pizza. But Shadow feels premonitions of creeping doom, an unspecified unease that colors the model prisoner's upcoming release.<br /><br />Shadow's dread is dead-on. He gets the news that his wife has been killed in a car accident, in flagrante fellatio with his buddy and business partner. Shadow is a free man without friends or prospects.<br /><br />Until he's recruited by an overly familiar, one-eyed stranger named Mr. Wednesday. Those familiar with their Norse mythology or who know the roots of the days of the week or who simply read Thor comics regularly should recognize a certain All-Father. Wednesday hires Shadow as a driver, bodyguard and all-purpose sidekick. As they travel around the country, Shadow receives periodic visits from his dead and decomposing wife. &#34;I want to be alive,&#34; Laura tells him. &#34;Make it happen, hon. You'll figure it out. I know you will.&#34;<br /><br />Wednesday convenes a conclave of neglected deities like himself, supernatural beings who were towed to America by immigrant believers, then forgotten and replaced over the centuries. &#34;Our true believers passed on, or stopped believing, and we were left, lost and scared and dispossessed, only what little smidgens of worship or belief we could find.&#34; These unwanted gods, some more obscure than others, eke out an existence as conmen &#34;in the cracks at the edges of society.&#34;<br /><br />Wednesday and his fellows have been forsaken by the Americans in favor of a new breed of master: &#34;gods of credit card and freeway, of Internet and telephone, of radio and hospital and television, gods of plastic and of beeper and of neon.&#34; (&#34;American Gods&#34; was written before the advent of social media and the iPad.) I recently sat at a Starbucks (It was the only coffeeshop that was open, OK?) trying to read &#34;American Gods&#34; while the three people in my vicinity never once stopped talking about the latest tech toys they possessed (or vice versa). I find Gaiman's concept far-fetched -- Not. At. All.<br /><br />Wednesday refuses to fade into the mists gracefully. He's determined to foment a geezer god rebellion and take back the worshipers that were once theirs.<br /><br />While Wednesday plans his would-be war, twisting reluctant arms to add recruits to the ranks, Shadow is approached by the new consumerist deities who try to lure him from his obsolete companions with enticements such as Lucy Ricardo's nekkid boobs. &#34;We are the coming thing. We're shopping malls -- your friends are crappy roadside attractions.&#34;<br /><br />In fact, Wednesday launches his seemingly doomed coup from one of these &#34;crappy&#34; places. England has its Stonehenge; America has its roadside attractions. As Wednesday explains: &#34;In the USA, people ... feel themselves being called to from the transcendent void, and they respond to it by building a model out of beer bottles of somewhere they've never visited, or by erecting a gigantic bat house in some part of the country that bats have traditionally declined to visit. Roadside attractions: people feel themselves being pulled to places where, in other parts of the world, they would recognize that part of themselves that is truly transcendent, and buy a hot dog and walk around, feeling satisfied on a level they cannot truly describe, and profoundly dissatisfied on a level beneath that.&#34;<br /><br />Northern California, where I was born, has the Trees of Mystery and Babe's blue balls. The Southwest, where I grew up, has The Thing. &#34;American Gods&#34; has the House on the Rock, Rock City and the exact center of the USA near Johnny Grib's hog farm. &#34;And he guessed he would take a roadside attraction, no matter how cheap, how crooked, or how sad, over a shopping mall, any day.&#34;<br /><br />Like a road trip to noplace in particular, &#34;American Gods&#34; meanders. (In the years since I bought my copy, a longer, &#34;restored&#34; version has been published, and I wonder if it coheres any better.) The book's not concerned with an A-to-Z plot so much as exploring the daffy byways of America through the eyes of somewhat bemused immigrants. Gaiman himself has the outsider's perspective as a Briton who transplanted himself and his family to Wisconsin, and these pages are full of fascination for his adopted country. &#34;This is the only country in the world ... that worries about what it is.&#34;<br /><br />It was somewhere past the halfway point of the book that I started to wonder if the plot was due to kick in anytime soon. But Gaiman is such a warm and generous storyteller that only the most impatient reader would resent the chance to stretch out in the backseat, let Gaiman take the wheel, follow the road wherever it might lead and worry about making good time later.<br /><br />I once eavesdropped on a conversation among fantasy writers. One of them, whom I won't embarrass by naming, an author of great talent but somewhat given to pettiness, sneeringly referred to Gaiman as a &#34;populist writer,&#34; as if he was some calculating LCD hack pandering to an audience of well-trained seals. Gaiman has earned every accolade, every devoted fan through a combination of restless striving to continually improve himself and the utmost graciousness to his readers. Gaiman is an almost unhumanly decent guy, and &#34;American Gods&#34; is a grandly ambitious attempt to encompass the soul of a country.<br /><br />One of the great things about Gaiman that pushes him beyond the surface-level &#34;populist&#34; category is the way his stories change over time. Oh, the words remain the same, but their meaning evolves, depending on the reader's age and personal experiences. There's a story called &#34;Troll Bridge&#34; that did little for me when I read it in my 20s, then floored me upon revisiting it in my 40s. Let's not even start on the baggage that &#34;Brief Lives&#34; carries. I very much enjoyed &#34;American Gods,&#34; but I'm not sure I fully grasped the whole of it. (Again, I'd like to someday take a crack at the unexpurgated version.) That's OK. I'm confident that whatever &#34;hidden Indians&#34; I might have missed on my first reading will still be waiting for me once I'm ready to see them..&#34;<br /><br />Like a road trip to noplace in particular, &#34;American Gods&#34; meanders.

0142000655|5.0|How did I miss this book in my earlier years? I was engrossed and keep thinking about so many parts of the book  I want to enjoy the beauty of the writing again.
B0091XICM0|2.0|It may have really been something 80 years ago, but the writing and acting were terrible compared to modern era movies. Sorry classic buffs, this one doesn't hold up. It didn't do anything for me.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This flic has all the checklist covered, not a movie for kids under 16 my opinion, funny all the way through with a few twists and surprises, singing is awesome too, cup song went #1, wish theyd make a 2nd
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow..............oh my word.............I honestly don't know if I hated it or loved it.  I am not ashamed to say that I cried like a baby at the end.  That is probably my main reason for giving it five stars, because I am not easily moved.  So, subjects that need to be addressed.  First of all, the language in this particular book is horrific.  I counted 7 sugar-honey-iced-teas, I AM NOT KIDDING.  Also, warning to all you other teens/tweens out there: contains 'adult content' (you know what I'm talking about).  YUCKY.  Also, this whole book, I felt like I was reading a different series.  If Veronica Roth had just stuck with her original 'factions' idea, I personally would have liked it a lot better.  But there is all this weird stuff about GPs and GDs and genetics.  It's a bunch of bunk in my opinion.  Anyway, I am super depressed now, because the ending was SO SAD.  I not joking, if you have read only the first book, save yourself a lot of pain and don't read the next two.  But if you are incredibly curious, (like yours truly) then I encourage you to spend your babysitting money on Insurgent and Allegiant.<br /><br />  -Maddie, age 13<br />  A sympathizer to all you teens/tweens out there who have had to endure the INCREDIBLE PAIN THAT Veronica Roth has put us through.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thought it would be sad but instead it was inspiring. I enjoyed the characters and the flow of the story.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|We love Katy Perry and this is by far the best CD! It is always great to have bonus tracks and I was really pleased to be able to get it through Amazon. Love it!

B009JZSC9S|4.0|I enjoyed this series, but I wouldn't recommend it to those who might oppose the &#34;sleeping around&#34; concept. I like watching TV series on my streamer,where I can watch as many episodes at a time that I want and without commercials!

B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Hard to put down once you get into it. A lot of intricate details threaded together for a great read.
B0033H7VI6|3.0|Nice blade but horribly awkward handle.  I have average size hands and the shape of the handle/tang only fit a higher held grip.  This blade would be much better off with a straight grip or only with a front finger grip spot.  I'm comparing this to the BK series, Seal pup and elite, Kabar fighting knife, and Gerber LMF 2,  all of which are way more comfortable.  The knife is also weighted awkward with the majority of the weight in the front of the handle.  To bad because the blade is awesome.<br /><br />I'm returning it and will try the Kabar Pot Belly forever in search of the perfect all around knife.
B006LSZECO|5.0|An excellent storyline which really pulls you in and brings you along throughout the book.<br />Well written, enjoyable and worth the read.

B00BSZZA3I|4.0|So, this case has worked out very well for me so far!! I had read lots of disparaging reviews about this case and still decided to take a chance with it. Not sure what some others were talking about with comments like: the phone just sits loosely in the case, the holes for the microphones/speakers,etc don't line up, and people can't hear me???  NONE of which I've experienced!! The case totally compliments the incredibly good looking HTC One in real classy/business like way!  The phone does 'snap' into the case and all cutouts and holes for speakers/microphones line up nicely!  (I've never had someone I called say they can't hear me!), The front flap that covers the phone's front (screen and speakers) at first doesn't close flush and lay flat and fasten in anyway, but does close more flush over time with use. NOTE: If your looking for serious protection against drops, shock, and running your phone over with your car, this isn't the case for you!!! I believe this case was designed more for protection against scratches and screen protection (more appropriate for a business setting) not against the battle field!! I'm Very Happy with it!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally putting this game on the kindle. LOVE IT!  I play this game everyday. It can be very challenging.
006202406X|5.0|Veronica Roth is one of the best authors and just starting out. This third book, in a seriers in which makes the hunger games look like the sissy games, is a wonderful and amazing ending. The free super savers shipping has no comparison.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been anticipating this app for months and it is here. The levels are challenging enough to make you want to play while not so to destroy your will to play. Seriously just get it!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|This app is wonderful, my 1 1/2 yr old loves Dr. Panda's Restaurant.This has a great hand, eye coordination feature.
039916409X|5.0|This is an active workbook, guiding you into exploring and releasing many blocks to expanding your wealth consciousness, your money \\"ceiling,\\" and your income.  Its challenging. It demands you actually get uncomfortable and do the work of tapping on yourself while feeling the forms negativity take for you. On the other side is inner peace where before there was inner turmoil. To attract we need to be putting out positive energy, and be eliminating the negative energy still being generated by our unconscious mind that conflicts with what we desire.  I've kept a journal along side of the book and spent at least 25 hrs digging and tapping with the new ideas she has presented.<br /><br />I've read many hundreds of self-help books over the years, this is among the very best I've ever worked my way through. It is more than a book about tapping into wealth, it is a model for tapping in any area of your life once you get the hang of how Margaret guides you to bring your own personal  emotionally charged issues and thoughts and paradigms to the surface.  It is so much easier to confront that stuff when you finally have a real tool that eliminates what you have dredged up, when you know you now have a tool to put an end to it. She even offers guided tapping scripts for each topic.<br /><br />Even if you don't find the courage to engage in something as foreign to you as tapping for the first time, be assured it does work. And the book will give you many insights and a vocabulary and new distinctions for thinking about your money that will serve you well. But do find the courage to tap along, for a far richer experience.  I've bought extra copies as gifts for my family already.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A good introduction to the genius of Tesla.  I think it would be great for middle school students doing biographies.
B009V0TV6O|2.0|This version is Free ANY day.  OK if all you wanted was a metronome to click away but there are plenty of those out there free every day.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The more I read the more I couldn't put it down. I love historical fiction and this certainly didn't disappoint me. The book has a plot from 1929-1943 and 2011. Both time periods are intertwined beautifully.  The characters are so believable and there are some surprises in the story that make you want more and more. This book is like Sarah's Key ( which is a marvel) because you feel a little part of history that you might not have been aware existed. Definitely worth reading!!

B007D5E7C2|5.0|Mr. Tarantino is my cinema hero. His films are a brand new genre as far as I am concerned and these two are no exception.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This is an easy to use program that does exactly as advertised. I already have multiple notebooks set up for keeping track of things. The only things that might make it better would be a few more cover choices, an auto-date option for notebooks so you wouldn't need a separate diary, and the ability to format text (bold, italic, etc.) Otherwise, it's awesome. :)

B00FPH6A70|3.0|The of 3 stars that I gave \\"The Conjuring\\" wasn't reflective of the Actors (performances well done). A 4 star rating would have been my preference had the film not been placed into the Biography/Drama category. Yes the persons portrayed are \\"REAL\\" the paranormal seeking couple the \\"Warrens\\" truly exist.  Mrs. Warrens paranormal connecting gift - true and proven repeatedly.  But for this film my let down was the needless use to exaggerate the physical occurrences of the attacks. I felt that was just for audience satisfaction. Heck I give \\"Carrie\\" original- go Sissy!!  5 star, best acting ever from up and coming young Hollywood A listers , no best acting in that film, but honest acting and no pretense...genuine, comes across the screen great.  Hope you understand what I was trying to draw from by using the later as an example.  Enjoy and hope this of help.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book, it was creepy and a great story.  Great to find that Danny came out okay, can't wait to find out how Abra does!

B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Good movie, got all 3. Thought the first 2 were better thou. Now to fill in my amazon required filler words, one two three four five six seven eight nine
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|I got this game when it was the free app o'the day. It's a cute little puzzle/sneaking game, that reminds me of Metal Gear. The first stages are a tutorial that teaches you all the game mechanics, and it has an easy learning curve.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the thief moves slowly. So does everyone else in the game. However, the game also loads slowly, and that's frustrating. There were smoother scene transitions on my NES, and I know the kindle has more processing power than that antique.<br /><br />I would give the game five stars but for the fact that every time I try to play the Castle Under Siege stage, the app quits and takes me back to the Kindle's home screen. As it stands, I was able to play 20 or so levels, quite enjoyably. Fix the kickout issue, and you'll get your two stars back.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like the game it is fun to play.  I wish I didn't have  to zoom in to find thing I prefer to see the whole picture

B0091REZMW|3.0|Enjoyed this immensley until i got to stage that got to buy stuff to get into rooms. Killed the experience a bit
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is the first time I have played this style of puzzle and I am completely hooked.  The developers did an awesome job designing this app.  It was very smooth and sophisticated in its handling and presentation.  I WAS NOT BOTHERED BY ADS!!!

B0091THDOM|5.0|I have been using this case for several months now, and I love it. It looks great, and the pull tab makes getting to my iPhone really easy. This case has also allowed me to ditch my wallet. I highly recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Take caution before playing this game as it will have you using up quit a bit of free time playing it. So yeah, you can say it's fun.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Just can't get enough of the show. Just when you think you've seen it all, another episode out ranks the previous one! I'm addicted.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game.  Very addicting.  I refuse to spend any money, that's  where it can get you.  Be very careful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hands down this is the best game I have ever played!  even better and more addictive then temple run! get it!
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Recommended read for anyone seeking depth in pure enjoyment reading. Only negative is cover and title. Neither reflects the book content and how really good it is.

1250038820|5.0|I can finally hold this incredible artist's work! This is a hardcover print book of &#34;street portraits&#34; with brief captions/summaries of the back stories behind each one. I fell in love with this artist's work because it is exactly the kind of work that I do, and it has inspired me! I pre-ordered this book, and it arrived the day of its release-- much to my liking! =) =)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is very easy to use and straightforward.  It works well and hasa weather function as well.  The alarm works easily too.  All for an incredibly low price.  A definite winner!
B00633W614|5.0|I stumbled on the 1st book in this series and was hooked. Read this one, The Sins of the Father, in a week and have already bought the 3rd book, Best Kept Secret.  I really like Jeffery Archer's style in this series and will continue through all 5 books as soon as they are out.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I remember watching The Beatles arrival at JFK. OK - now you know how long I've been following McCartney. Through his LSD comments, his post-Lennon-assassination \\"It's a drag\\" comment, the triumph of \\"McCartney\\", followed by the debacle of Wings Wild Life, the resurrections of RAM, Band On The Run, and the nadirs of McCartney II, Off The Ground - numerous concerts, sharing the sadness of Linda's loss, the cruelty of the psychotic Heather,  and a thrilling moment of seeing him, looking oh so happy, with Nancy at the concession stand of a NYC movie theater several years ago. on through the triumphs of C&CITB, Memory Almost Full, and Electric Arguments.  It is through this lens that I listened to III---III, or as it's known, \\"NEW\\". (Excuse the \\"lens\\" \\"listened\\" mixed metaphor)<br /><br />I'm coming a little late to this review party. I had to give this disc some time. I heard the song New and absolutely l-o-v-e-d it. Watched all the McCartney TV appearances, the Kimmel concert, et al. Found myself humming the song throughout my day, and thinking \\"this is as good, and catchy as anything he wrote for The Beatles\\". I expected more of the same. That was my mistake. And when the album was released, I found myself initially disappointed.<br /><br />But this is great stuff. I recently had it playing in the background of my classroom, while the high school students were working on projects, and my post-hippy-musically-knowledgable student looked up and said: \\"This is good - every song sounds different\\". And I realized he was right. This is as good an eclectic mix of songs as any McCartney has ever released. I won't go through a song-by-song review (the lead reviewer does a good job of that) but I will say that Queenie Eye is amazing (and solves a nearly 50 year (!) mystery of John Lennon's \\"O-U-T spells OUT\\" on The Beatles 1964 Christmas fan disc \\"Christmas Time Is Here Again\\")<br /><br />This album has really, really grown on me. Give it a shot. \\"Appreciate\\" incorporates McCartney's Fireman pushing-the-envelope production, \\"Save Us\\" is a Wings/Memory Almost Full power-pop amalgam. \\"Scared\\" allows McCartney to bare his soul in the first person - no hidden \\"characters\\" as ever before. \\"Old Days' re-captures the nostalgiac looking-back \\"The Song We Were Singing\\" on Flaming Pie. But this time, McCartney's voice is allowed to show it's aging frailty, adding delicacy and fragility rather than simple nostalgia. \\"On My Way To Work\\" incorporates the guitar strumming of \\"Follow Me\\" from C&CITB, and a fictional day in the life of, ala, Look At The Average Person from Pipes Of Peace with an amusingly rhythmic lyric about looking at a naked pic in a magazine (naughty, cheeky boy!)<br /><br />Boyish? In the best sense. \\"NEW\\", created by McCartney at 71 years of youth gives me hope for my next decade as well. This music is so youthful, and some of it so vital, it makes me excited to hear what McCartney will be creating during the next decade.<br /><br />I've given it some time. I've listened to it over and over again. Do I like \\"New\\"? Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br /><br />UPDATE: We were listening to a lot of McCartney this weekend, and my wife remarked, that yea, the album is good, but not \\"as good as\\" Flaming Pie, or Flowers In The Dirt. I pointed out that those albums were met with lukewarm reviews when they came out, but are now considered \\"McCartney classics\\". I wouldn't expect McCartney to be doing the same riffs after 15-25 years, and I really think that NEW will age just as well, and show that Paul McCartney continued to grow as an artist. He'll never be as current as, say, Macklemore, but I see that as being a good thing. I'm gettin' older too. As the man sings in Alligator: \\"I want someone to come home to / I need somewhere I can sleep / I need a place where I can rest my weary bones / and have a conversation not too deep.  It will be a sad day indeed when Paul McCartney no longer provides us with catchy, bouncy, upbeat, joyous, silly love songs.<br/><br />Godspeed Sir Paul McCartney!/><br />Godspeed Sir Paul McCartney!
B00A757EFW|4.0|this is a great game I really enjoy playing and learning more on how to play , most /every time i open it ( to play ) it comes up with  an avrotizement  saying \\"do s#x offenders live near you?\\"And then it shows a picture of a REALLY CRAZY LOOKING PERSON! I don`t know how many are in my area, but now l`m scared to go IN MY FRORNT YARD ,BACK YARD AND EVEN MY GREOGE!!!!
B00190N4E4|5.0|This movie challenges the viewer to examine the motivating forces and beliefs  that lie behind the way people treat and interact with others.  Gandhi's unwillingness to engage in violence is something other than courage.  He recognized an ultimate truth:  violence always begets violence. Nonviolence became a way of life for him;  Living a life of nonviolence for him was as natural as the way we drink a cup of water to alleviate thirst.<br /><br />The movie underscores another ulitmate truth recognized by Gandhi. When powerful people use their elite positions to advance agendas of the few  they inflict suffering and pain in the lifes of the many.<br /><br />The scenes showing rank after rank of men, carrying no weapons, walking toward the British army, knowing they were going to be clubbed down was not easy to watch. Seeing soldiers open fire on the throngs of children, women and men is horrible.<br /><br />Given the warring history of the human animal, that has continued after Ghandi's death, this movie made me bow my head is sorrow and wonder; &#34;When will we ever learn?&#34;
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I'm now half way through and have a hard time putting it down, love it. I recommend this series to anyone that likes British history novels.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am very pleased with this bag. I was able to get it to swallow two DLR's and a pair of flashes. It also holds two other lenses and more. It is larger slightly than my old bag that I bought for $100 five years ago! I am tempted to buy a second one for my other needs as well!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm officially addicted! It has so many ideas to find and you can share yours with the world. Great for when you don't have a clue what you want to do for that wedding, baby shower or diy project!
B0098460O4|2.0|CD must be defective. Has a &#34;rough&#34; spot or two that does not play so you just have to wait until it passes. Have not had time to return for I just listened to it this week. Maybe I would like it better if not for problems. Judith A Mills
B009AMAGQM|3.0|The premise is good and the special effects are wonderful. Not a scary or great movie but worth a bowl of popcorn and watching.
B007EC27QM|4.0|It gets the job done and has memory. Not all the free calculators do. And I don't know if it has ads because I haven't noticed any.<br /><br />I would def recomend.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I had a bit of an issue with the pentalobe 5 bit, but the customer support quickly got me a new bit.  I have not had any trouble with any other bit, so I assume that was a fluke manufacturing defect.  The new bit I received worked great and the customer support for cyberguys is second to none.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|As a teacher of organizational behavior and researcher of women entrepreneurs I love that so many of Sheryl's anecdotes are backed by respected research. It goes a long way to highlight that the stories of her blessed life,with all of its barriers and successes, is not the main story. The main story is that society is moving forward in terms of gender equality and as a society we should continue to lean in to this. I have incorporated this book into an assignment for my grad students this quarter. I can't wait to see their work!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I tried the first few experiments and nothing happened so I gave up.  BUT the author does have some very good ideas and a lot of the book reminded me of some things I had forgotten about.  It was a good reminder about how to use the law of attraction.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is soooooo good!!!!! It's a wonderful ending to the trilogy! I read the book in 3 days, I couldn't put it down!
B0083GQKQG|4.0|A gripping movie with an excellent performances, but hard to watch because of the heavy nature of the story. No happy endings here.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Math-geeks will like this, though the game does well to hide its insidious mathematical problem-solving agenda.  so parents, you can feel fine and dandy letting your little ones tackle the challenges the jibber jabbering tiki man has for you with his little light ball friends.  Nothing too scary, nothing uber-cute, so I feel it's a good gender-neutral game for whatever age (I'm 29).<br /><br />Only thing I really don't like about it is that I must be online and signed in on Amazon.  So, I can't do my usual airplane mode game play.  But that's fine, since there's no ads or easy-to-hit links in the game (I got it as one of the free games of the day on Amazon).<br /><br />Another negative might be that it's all basically the same puzzle after puzzle, just in different colors.  So, some might bore easily with it.  But sometimes people like those types of games.  I'm sure there's some easy formula to crack that will make this game not fun at all, but since I'm a big kid and don't have that as an assignment then woohoo for being a dumb adult.<br /><br />Visuals: very pretty, easy on the eyes, not many fast graphics, good colors.  I like the darker colors, since I like to play at night.<br /><br />Game play: simple to complex, strategy with increasing difficulty, all un-timed in adventure mode.  If you mess up then the little Totemo dude is all &#34;Aw, it's ok, we have faith in you,&#34; blah blah blah, so it's rather encouraging, but he also sometimes tells you to maybe take a break and come back to it at another time, so I guess it's the game's way of telling you you're spending too much time playing a videogame.  Once you complete all the levels there's Survival Mode where you do all the same stuff basically but it's timed.  You're given so many seconds to complete each task/level.  Starts out easy and then gets more complicated, but with it being more complicated it allows you more time accordingly to solve it.  If you mess up it will restart your level but not the time.  When time runs out, Survival Mode ends and you have to start all over from the beginning.<br /><br />I'd like for there to be updates with more levels, though.  I now only have Survival Mode, and have gotten up to I think level/task 24?me.  When time runs out, Survival Mode ends and you have to start all over from the beginning.<br /><br />I'd like for there to be updates with more levels, though.  I now only have Survival Mode, and have gotten up to I think level/task 24?

B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is my favorite version of Emma. The casting fits each character and we immensely enjoyed watching each of the episodes.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the Shining especially if the didnt particularly care for Stanley Kubrick's movie. I like how Dan Torrance is a tortured person like his father but not arrogant. He has been trying to escape his past but finally realizes that its part of what makes him special. If you are a Stephen King fan, you will love it
1843106698|5.0|A must read for anyone who has a family member &#34;on the spectrum&#34;.  A must have book for parents who want to know the &#34;all&#34; of asperger's syndrome.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book was fantastic!  It got me moving and restored my love and passion for writing!  It motivated me to continue writing and set me on the path to finishing my novel and finding my voice!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The final installment of the Divergent was different from many YA fiction in that it was unpredictable. I read the less than favorable reviews before purchasing it and found that my opinion of the book quite differed from those already posted. Remembering that this book is written for youths and not adults may help with reading the last installment of this trilogy. The story got a bit convoluted at one point and I was wondering how the author would pull the story off. The ending was not predictable for me and while not terribly emotional either, I found it to be realistic.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Even though the game is very short, it's definitely worth it. I would have gladly paid two dollars for it, but I got lucky and got it when it was free! It is surprisingly intriguing, and the graphics are amazing.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Just a good tool to have on the shelve. You always need a good dictionary that can help in a tight spot.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|l like this app! I love Star Wars and Angry Birds and this app has it all! I got Angry Birds Star Wars 2 and it's awesome! I like this app too because it has all of the Star Wars characters in bird form! now I have two Angry Birds Star Wars apps! give this app five stars! keep up the good work!

0375869026|5.0|R.J Palacio's novel is beatiful, funny, and sometimes tearful. 5th grade August Pullman has facial abnormalties, and he has to &#34;survive&#34; 5th grade. August, or Auggie has been home-schooled until 5th grade, so he isn't really in the popularity factors. Auggie's sister-Via or Olivia- and his parents are overly protective of him. At first, Auggie decides he hates the school, because he is afraid of other people staring at him, but he is somewhat used to the rude stares. When he makes a new friend, something makes him think 5th grade isn't so bad at all. Wonder is a emotional roller coaster that just is absouloutely thrilling.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game very much. It is quite addicting, ask anyone who plays. I have been stuck in the same level for about 2 months now and it's so frustrating, but I don't stop playing. : ) this is a game that you will easily get attached to.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Takes awhile to get in the habit but the more you use it the more you will benefit and keep using

B00FAX6XQC|2.0|Not very good on kindle fire hd. To shaky to aim the shot and keeps moving when you have the aim ready to fire but I love hunting so I will try to figure it out.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The tiles are attractive. It feels good to succeed at the rounds. I am on the easy level for now but it's nice to have the opportunity for more challenge.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I have read Pines and Wayward now and all I can say is &#34;Keep 'em coming!&#34;.  This could easily become a tv show.  There are great characters, excitement, science fiction, horror, action, drama, romance (a wee bit) and an awesome story line!  I just bought Abandon too, although not part of this series.  I just really like the author's style.  Buy it...you'll like it!

B009LMTDL0|5.0|So much of this resonated for me, especially the leaving before you leave idea,  coming from home with traditional roles I began to set this in motion long before I had children, even though I had broken into a non traditional field and become a mechanical engineer working in construction industry.  I want to help my daughter and son to find better balance and that begins with me setting example now.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Not much of brain trainer, more of a brain thorn. I tried many of the puzzles, but the only thing that I got from the puzzles was a headache. Too many of the puzzles require hand-eye coordination, they are not brain exercises that strengthen memory which is what I thought the app would be with the title of brain trainer. Part of the headaches came from trying to understand the poorly written instructions. I will be removing this app from my Kindle Fire.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I like face book but don't like the way they keep opening it up for the world to see except just the people that it is intended for and my immediate friends.<br /><br />Marilyn Anderson

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Not what you expect and I liked how it was all connected in a unexpected way.  Easy read and kept me turning the page.
B00ERIUO02|2.0|After hearing all the hype over the new Katy Perry album, I had really gotten my hopes up over &#34;Prism.&#34; After listening to it from beginning to end, there's really only a few songs on the entire album that don't make me want to toss it in the trash. Don't get me wrong, I love Katy. She's my go-to when I'm in the mood to listen to something fun. But this album, I just can't get into it nearly as much as I had hoped. I had heard so many critic reviews rate this album as almost Alannis Morissette-esque....Not even CLOSE!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Blown out of my freaking socks by this one. I've been a long time Creed/Tremonti fan but I could never come around to AB. It was just something about Kennedy's voice I never really liked. I did however somewhat like their first album, but Blackbird and III were a pretty big let down. There may have been 2 songs on each of those albums I liked and that was it. But this one... hoooolllyyy cattle. From the first song, this is what AB SHOULD have been from day one. I'm also glad to hear they finally let Mark sing a few tunes and somehow I dont feel like I'm having an ice pick jabbed in my ear from Miles' voice. He actually 'sings' for once.<br /><br />Long story short, if you have always been on the fence like I have about AB, well you can come on down now and go ahead and get this album. Its finally worth every cent you pay to listen to them.<br />I just really cant wait for the next Creed album or Marks second solo album. I'm sure Scott Stapps next album will be great too, much better than Great Divide at least.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I finally was able to get it on my kindle I love this game. This is one of my favourite game.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|The only movie that comes close to Christmas Vacation are the other Vacation movies. Chevy Chase is a master at being a funny man. If you want more make sure you watch all the Vacation Moves.<br />Thanks to the cast for the best movie ever.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Very entertaining for my five year old, he's having a blast with this game.  I haven't checked it out myself but he's entertained.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|Game is fun but has too many advertisements. Apple version was much better. The skill level was too easy. On the other hand it was free which is a great price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had been waiting to play the game and now I can hardly put it down.  The graphics are great.  The game is very challenging!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you Amazon and KING.COM....!!!!<br />This game is AWESOME....SO EXCITED that it on KINDLE FIRE NOW ...THANK YOU FOR THINKING ABOUT THE REST OF US!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.  50+ year old Mom so addicted, it makes no sense!<br /><br />Now I understand what my kids were doing with online gaming.  You can't break away.<br /><br />:-)
006202406X|1.0|I struggled to get through this. It was poorly written and despite so many different plot twists it dragged. Roth changed the format of this book and began switching between point of views. This was a mistake. There wasn't much tonal difference between the two. A more skilled writer could have done a lot  this, but Roth wasted the POV switch up. The writing in this book was so bad. Somewhere, heads should be rolling, and Harper Collins should be enrolling their staff in writing 101 classes.<br /><br />All of this could have been forgiven except that Roth broke the tacit agreement between reader and writer. She killed her protagonist, and it's pointless. It does not move the story forward or wrap it up; it's just a giant suck fest.<br /><br />If you liked the first two books, avoid this one at all costs as it renders the entire series pointless.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|It froze up in the middle of the game. That sucked because I was just about to be done and I couldn't get the hidden key in the hidden secret drawers, so I couldn't finish with the clues. It was a great game up until then.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is wonderfully made! I play it on my kindle. Good story, beautiful graphics, a truly epic adventure shrouded in mystery!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It doesn't work!  When I sent a request to Google for assistance, I received no reply.  The problem may have something to do with my WiFi system being dual band.  Google's information on associated website does say Chromecast won't work with dual band wireless.  However, my system does provide a visitor's access to the Internet via a single band; but Chromecast won't work with this access, either.

Veronica Roth you know  what I mean!!!!!! Like when that happened i was  literally crying like really??? Why????just why??? Now I'm gonna give spoilers<br /><br />  :SPOILERS:<br />First off,  I was referring to Tris`s death. Why did she die?? Like really you had me crying. I now know why you had to add in Tobias`s point of view. But now I'm sad and mostly just want something happy so now I'm probably going to go watch either the hunger games or silver linings playbook. Probably read the hunger games series again  -for like the 8th time-<br /><br />Also something that bugged me was when Tobias worked with Nita and they got in a. Huge fight. Not that specific part but the part leading  upto it... URIA`S DEATH. I absolutely hated tha.<br /><br />I also didn't like that Caleb never died. Instead  you kill off a main character. Like really??? I liked Caleb at first but then  in Insurgent, he became the character I hate the most. So  why did you let him live  and kill the most important character?<br /><br />I also could not stand it when Tobias accepted his mom again. Like that bugged the crap out of me.<br /><br />Also when Peter reset his memory? Was that nessicary? I think not. He was fine . He was less violent, he  was getting better  with anger, and he was not getting in the way. But no. He still  had to reset his memory.<br /><br />  Thank you for reading this....... and I am NOT saying this  was a bad book I still love it and still gave it 5 stars but i just got emotional. But  it was  still great. :) thank you Veronica Roth :D
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|The story line isnt bad. I mean we are not talking a deep political thriller, but its fun and it works for the movie,  which is just pure entertainment.  Special effects are great too.  So in all a good movie.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is AWESOME! I love this game! The bucks are hard to get but it is AWESOME! It is really hard to get a dinosaur.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|There is not much to complain about for #1 and #2.  They both do a great job in bringing back the series although with a new time line.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Great Book.  Shows a lot of scholarship.  A must for all students of Christology.  Asian is respectful of people of faith.  There is nothing in this book that will change somebody who believes in the Jesus Christ of faith.
