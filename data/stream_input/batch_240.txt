0783222955|5.0|I read two books the summer I turned fourteen, this was one of them. It moved me, for the first time, very deeply, and haunted me with it's quiet and unflinching look at racism, seen through the eyes of the purest of us all, children. I identified with Jem and Scout and Dill and wished I could go with them on the heart-stopping excursions to Boo's house; I felt the broad spectrum of emotion that this classic evokes in me to this day, and when it was brought to the screen, there was nothing missing; it is a complete, intact translation into cinema and is, in my opinion, the best performance of Gregory Peck's career. I hated Mayella Ewell for a long time, until I realized what her life was truly like and the real villain here is her father. I felt so bad for Brock Peters, and I felt his hopelessness so keenly, it was hard to watch, much harder than it was to read, and the pain and resignation on his face still conjures up all the hate crimes that continue to this day, and reminds me, uncomfortably, of the truck dragging death in Texas. The setting is wonderful, the gifts in the tree from Boo are touching, and the feeling of sorrow when Mr. Radley fills up the hole is profound. Dill, the character drawn directly from Truman Capote, is one of my favorite characters, the old-young wisdom and mature vocabulary are a joy to watch. Calpurnia is solid and comforting in the fast-changing world of the Finch household, and you are glad she is there. The court-room scene is riveting, as is the byplay in the balcony, where Jem, Dill and Scout sneak in and watch the proceedings. The Reverend, when the trial is over, cautions the children to \\"Stand up, your father is passing..\\" so thankful is he that Atticus, although losing the case, has nevertheless made a strong statement by virtue of the fact that he kept the jury out so long...and of course, the end, when the children are attacked on their way home from a Halloween party at the school by none other than Tom Ewell. Boo saves their lives, and when Atticus agrees with the Sheriff to let it be, and leave Boo alone, Scout says, \\"I understand...it would be like killing a mockingbird.\\" And Atticus sits up all night in Jem's room, and as Scout says, \\"Atticus stayed there all night, and would be there when Jem waked up in the morning...\\"eir lives, and when Atticus agrees with the Sheriff to let it be, and leave Boo alone, Scout says, \\"I understand...it would be like killing a mockingbird.\\" And Atticus sits up all night in Jem's room, and as Scout says, \\"Atticus stayed there all night, and would be there when Jem waked up in the morning...\\"
B000002B30|3.0|This album includes some (not all) of Bruce Springsteen's greatest hits, i.e. his most popular songs as played on the radio. This is not an album of Bruce Springsteen's best songs. The two should not be confused. Where is Because The Night, Kitty's Back, Blinded By The Light, Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, Rosalita, The E Street Shuffle, or Spirit In The Night? This is a solid album of \\"hits\\" but falls short of capturing the essence of Bruce. Yes, the songs chronicle his shifting moods and failed relationships from Born To Run to the contemporary fluff pieces (nothing close to \\"hits\\") from a reunionized E Street Band. For those who appreciated and loved Bruce before he became famous and had hits, this album will deliver but, ultimately, disappoint.
B000065U1N|1.0|This movie is &quot;based on fact&quot;, but turns out to be the biggest lie to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The truth is that US helicopters went in and murdered 100s of innocent folks and in retaliation the innocent folk fought back.
0312265859|5.0|Have you read this series? If no, start now! If yes, buy Hard Eight ASAP; fun reading lies ahead! Unlike Grafton's \\"alphabet series\\" which is getting formulaic and almost boring, Evanovich continues her \\"number series\\" at her high standard.<br />Stephanie Plum continues to be a vitally inept bounty hunter. In this one she loses four (or is it five?) sets of handcuffs. She needs help bringing in one of her targets as he suffers from poor equilibrium: she cuffs him, he falls over, he's too fat to right himself--believe me, its laugh-out-loud funny. And, of course, Grandma Mazur continues her two favorite activities: ogling every man under seventy and haunting wakes to checkout the mortician's handiwork. Stephanie continues to be conflicted about her two men: the mysterious Ranger and cop Joe Moretti. Her stout heart and indefatigable manner finally pay off--you know they will--and the good guys triumph.<br />Evanovich is a master of presenting a time and place: the Burg in New Jersey. Her humor is rampant and her characters are winning. Like I said: start or continue this series. Now!
B000066NW0|5.0|Finally, a bright female pop star that does not have to show her navel or bleach her hair blonde #231. Songs are great, not just pop juke box fare. At times her vocals sound a bit like Alanis, but hey, I like Alanis too. There is room for everybody and this new sensation is worth listening to. Check out the cd and review yourself. I don't like a lot of what's out there but this cd is a keeper.
B00000DQWT|5.0|I can honestly say that I have listened to this album over a zillion times and of ALL the music I've listened to in my life(been listening to jazz since I was four)this is my &quot;Favorite Album of ALL Time&quot;...Bar none. This was the beginning of my listening to Pat Metheny and company in 1985. These are the most thought provoking melodies and the most harmonius music I've evr heard.&quot; &quot;Daulton Lee&quot; is my favorite piece. L-O-V-E It. Also I love &quot;Chris&quot; and &quot;This is not America&quot;. I've listened and bought every PMG album I can find since.I have seen them in concert four times and they never cease to amaze me.
B000003TAB|4.0|After the unparalleled success of \\"Nevermind\\" fans of Nirvana were treated something much different than they expected. Instead of a brand new studio album there was \\"Incesticide\\", a collection of B-sides gathered from the band in their then 4 yeear career. Some believe that Cobain released this album as a stop gap to the success of \\"Nevermind\\", never the less it is a good collection.<br />Several songs on \\"Incesticide\\" sound like they could be off of \\"Bleach\\" such as \\"Sliver\\", \\"(New Wave) Polly\\" and \\"Downer\\". One of the most suprising songs on the album is \\"Molly's Lips\\" which is unlike Nirvana, with a very upbeat and almost positive feel to it. The album finishes off with what I personally believe to be the best track on the album, \\"Aneurysm\\", a song that seems to hang in limbo between the \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\" albums. <br />Cobain was a genius, and Nirvana was a godsent band of 90's. In fact, this is the only Nirvana album where I have given a 4 star rating, only because it isn't a complete studio album. But that last statement says alot about this collection of B-Sides alone, because usually a B-Sides album from a band is nothing more than an effort to sell albums. <br />A great collection from a great band, R.I.P. Kurt Cobain.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I had never seen Citizen Kane when I bought this DVD. When I got it, I watched it twice; once for the film, and the second time for Roger Ebert's excellent commentary.<br />Ebert has an obvious enthusiasm for good cinema in general and  Citizen Kane in particular. With nearly every shot he provides anecdotes, trivia, and valuable insight. His explanations of the various photographic tricks (deep focus, back projecting, sets that literally split apart to allow for freer camera movement) allow you to appreciate the film on a very technical level.
B000066F6H|3.0|Here's a little something you could try, pop in \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" next time you have one of your friends over.  Then ask them what time period of rock they think the band they're hearing hails from.  Finish this up by informing them on who The Hives are, then watch the look of suprise come over there face.  In a rock world where everything seems to be moving foward with DJ's, sound effects and (annoying) rapping lead singers it's nice to hear a band that sticks to the basics. <br />\\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" in itself is what you would come to expect from The Hives.  Rock reminscent of punk's humble beginnings, as each track follows eachother in a non-stop cycle up until it's finish.  Highlight songs include \\"Die, All right!\\", \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" and \\"Supply And Demand\\".  There is however one track that I absolutely despise, \\"Find Another Girl\\" is an all around annoying track.  To put it quite simply, I hate \\"Find Another Girl\\".<br />And while I have respect for the band, the album as a whole just doesn't seem to cut it.  Maybe it's just a matter of taste, but \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" doesn't get much rotation in my daily CD listening.  For those of you who praise this album I'm not going to come out and say your wrong for calling this a 5 star release, because frankly your not.  Like I have mentioned, this album will appeal to some, and won't cut it for others.  <br />Personally, I expected much better things from this album, it wasn't a total let down, but it wasn't even close to what I hoped for.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite albums.  I bought it after hearing it playing in a bookstore.  It is the type of album you can listen to over and over.  Just putting it in the CD player and waiting for the first strains of music to begin causes me to relax.  When the music starts, it is also accompanied by a sigh of stress leaving my body.  She is soulful and wonderful without having the &quot;show off&quot; complex of many screaming divas.  A must have!
0446677450|5.0|I've noticed a lot of criticism of this book. What I will ask those who are so upset is, &quot;how is what you're doing now working for you?&quot;<br />Robert's book teaches you that you can work for money or you can have money work for you, but you can't do both. One will make you wealthy and the other will keep you slaving away until you're 65.<br />The people in my life who are naturally wealthy follow the rules of this book. For those of us not blessed with the knowledge, I'm glad someone's writing a book like this to share it with us.
0440539811|5.0|Remember the feeling you had in your mind when you saw \\"The Matrix\\"?...the not-quite-right, surreal sensation that all you knew could be nothing but a delusion?  Throw that into a blender, along with every other superstition, fantasy, illusion and fear you've ever known.<br />Reading this book is like sending your delighted mind off on a roller coster...in flames.<br />Drugs?  You'll be high on possibilies.<br />Fuggedaboudit!  An Alice in Wonderland for the New Millenium- and a world in need of an alternate reality- and a belly full of laughter.<br />Highly recommended.
0316666343|5.0|Life. Death. Love. Family. Murder most foul. Ms Sebold has woven a tale to warm the stoniest of hearts. Such a pleasure to read a well written story about characters you can care about. Warm. Funny. Chilling. The \\"hype\\" is absolutely justified. Call me prejudiced, but I love Alice and I loved the The Lovely Bones.

B00005176F|5.0|Blur for the longest time became one of those &quot;Man I would really like to hear some stuff from Blur but I don't know where to start&quot; bands. Luckly, I found out they had a best of. And I listened to it. Now I'm buying their entire catalog. See? I really am a push over.<br />Starting off with the first two tracks from Blur's self-titled release(beetlebum and song 2. WOO HOO!), the compliation grabs you with two of Blur's catchiest songs. From there, things become a variable mix of songs from their catalog(though its focus seems to be parklife and post-parklife material). In a sense, the best of Blur is great way to get into the song writing style of Blur. Sometimes catchy(There's No Other way). Sometimes smarmy(Parklife). Sometimes emotional(Tender and No Distance Left To Run are real heart breakers). But as diverse as the tracks come, the songwriting never suffers. All the tracks on here are an excellent and sample what Blur is capable of as song writers(though there are some amazing tracks that aren't on here, but oh well). Saddly, if had a complaint, is that it doesn't cover their early years as much as the later years. Maybe the songwriting wasn't as good but I would still like a more complete retrospective. Oh well, no biggie.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to get into Blur. Its great sampler of a great band.
B000002TQV|5.0|If you're chronically depressed and would like to stay that way, this could be the album for you. For whatever reason, the mood is extremely sullen this time around, and there is not an uplifting song anywhere. But it doesn't matter, because all of the songs are consistently good! That seems to be rare these days, where you buy an album and it turns out that the three hit singles were all it had going for it. Believe the hype: Radiohead probably is the best thing to happen to rock music in the '90s.<br />\\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" are slow-moving and depressed, but the mope-rock shtick never gets mushy, and there are some songs that rely on sudden dynamics changes to keep the energy going (\\"Just,\\" \\"Bones\\"). Singer Thom Yorke has become one of my favorite male vocalists, the way he can sound desperate and pleading, then incredibly angry, and his voice stays so beautiful. The rest of the band is rather understated, but they're great, not to mention gritty and experimental. They've got a really amazing grip on dynamics, their sophisticated chord progressions make the catchy tunes durable, and their artistic integrity is almost unsurpassed. No snotty superstar whining about these guys!<br />In my eyes, Radiohead and their two best albums, The Bends and OK Computer, are a very good reason to hold out any hope for rock music in the coming few years.
B000065U1N|4.0|The fact that this story is true is gut wrenching. The action is unbeatable, the emotion is feeling. You really get into this movie.  Especially in wake of 9/11 you can't help but cheer and applaude.  But you need a strong stomach to deal with the content.  Very real.
B000002UDB|5.0|The Beatles' relentless musical tour ran in place this time. It took them several months more to realize that their carefully crafted fusion of Dylan-esque lyrics and Brian Wilson-esque production values was a dead end, and, instead, to move in a million directions at once on their next album. However, they managed to toss off a classic collection of songs while jogging on their treadmill (title track, modelled on its Sgt. Pepper's counterpart; &quot;I Am The Walrus,&quot; another elaborately tripped-out Lennon tune). Paul dominates a bit too much, with some of his upbeat pop numbers wearing thin (&quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;), but others being marvelous (&quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;). Half of the record is a newly-recorded double EP, and the other half is singles from the previous 12 months, including some truly classic hits: John's extraordinary acid-rock production &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; which almost topped the Beach Boys' contemporary &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;; Paul's marvelous, cleverly orchestrated &quot;Penny Lane&quot;; and the irresistable, perfectly timed Summer of Love anthem &quot;All You Need Is Love.&quot;
B00005221L|2.0|Having read so many complaints about this particular DVD edition, I'd recommend the Region 2 Special Edition (available from Amazon.co.uk) if you can play Region 2 PAL DVDs. <br />The Special Edition features the same transfer as this disk (with DTS) but comes with a second disk loaded with extras (all of which are great). As well as that, the menus and packaging are also far superior. It doesn't look like this will be making it to Region 1 for some time (after all the previous releases), so this looks like your best bet for the foreseeable future.
B000002UB3|5.0|The first use of synthesizers on a rock albums that made any sense (in contrast, please see the Notorious Byrds Brothers), but that's hardly the reason Abbey Road burns itself into your soul. George's two finest songs are both here (&quot;Something&quot; - Frank Sinatra once called it the greatest love song ever written - and &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;), and Ringo has a good song here, too (&quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;). John's compositions on Abbey Road aren't his best, but quite good anyway (&quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;Because&quot;). Paul doesn't contribute any of his immortal ballads, but his impeccable musicianship is on display throughout (&quot;Oh! Darling,&quot; &quot;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&quot;). And if you haven't heard his infamous &quot;pop symphony&quot; which dominates side 2, well, you haven't lived.
0316666343|5.0|I LOVED this book!  Unlike the previous reviewer, I didn't really pay attention to the pre-release publicity so I had no expectations going in.  I thought this was one of the most cleverly written books I'd read in a very long time.  I loved the narrator's perspective of her family and friends and the all-too-human characters, but I was truly blown away by Sebold's ability to convey the essence of a 14 year old girl.  It was perfectly imperfect - at times whining, at others introspective, occasionally self-centered.  The story is at once horrific and sad and humorous and tense; Susie's perspective of her parents' marriage, her sister's relationships and her own killer made me feel like I truly knew these people as she had.  The fact that she is forever 14, physically and emotionally is emphasized so subtly by her voyer's view of those she left behind.  The Lovely Bones is a winner.
B000002A3T|4.0|While it would be nice to have a Roger Waters-involved Pink Floyd album, that looks like an impossibility.  But not that the situation is that bad.  While Waters took is a better lyricist, and can hold a concept album together better, you have to put up with excessive preaching and a mother fixation.  So to hear Pink Floyd these days, you listen to the music more, and kind of take the lyrics as they come.  <br />Actually, I like this album a lot, because, like a James Bond movie, if you put in all the necessary components, AND LIKE THOSE COMPONENTS (unlike the James Bond components), you still have something of interest.  First, you need the intro to the album that takes forever.  Then, you attempt topics that are much too complex for us ordinary mortals to contemplate, and while Waters did this better, this album gives it a good try.  Throw in the saxaphone solos at just the right time.  And if you listen closely enough, with your eyes closed, you can see the tight-fitting mini-dresses of the female backup singers.  <br />All of the above gets enough play to make it a Pink Floyd album.  But it wouldn't work if it didn't have that Pink Floyd instrumentation, led by Gilmore's guitar work.  While there is nothing that innovative here, he does just good enough of a job to for more than a passing grade. I really enjoyed this one, and wish there were more, even with this watered-down version of the band.

0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen cements forever the important role comics play in the field of literature. But having said that, Watchmen is much more. It is like reading a great book, watching a great movie, and studying great illustration all at once. To say it is the best comic ever written is missing the point: it is the ESSENTIAL comic. It is about why comics even exist, the purpose of their existence, and how that reflects upon our society - hell, on our world.<br />The only trouble with Watchmen is, Alan Moore set such an impossibly high standard for himself, he could never live up to it again, as richly satisfying as almost all of his work is. Everything following Watchmen is just icing on the cake.

B00005JKQZ|1.0|I absolutely, 150% HATED this movie!...  After getting so many great reviews and winning 4 Oscars, I was excited to see this movie.  What a disappointment it turned out to be! The acting wasn't terrible on the actors and actresses part, but the whole plot was horrific! I can't believe this movie got such great reviews! ... It's such a shame such an amazing and inspiring story was put to pieces.
B00005JKNF|5.0|If you are sick of the poorly written trash that Hollywood produces year after year; if watching such Hollywood blockbusters as Armageddon was more painful than getting a colon exam; If the last book you read did not have lust in the title, I suggest watching this movie.  I am amazed it ever got made.  Come on Maggy Smith did not even take off her shirt.  There is not a cheesey love story in which one-sided characters, say, kill their fiance's mother, then torture kittens, and finally take away food from starving orphans, nor is anything blown up by an army of overgrown bugs on an uncontrolled rampage of human flesh.  The movie simply relies on good acting, directing, and writing. I thought it deserved best picture.
0131103628|4.0|with all due respect to K&amp;R, i have to point out that there are better C programming books for beginners. &lt;C a software engineering approach&gt;(3ed), is a good example: it does a better job cleaning the dusty corners of C.<br />for this K&amp;R's book, one thing i don't understand is that they seem to be obssessed with using string processing functions as examples. the matter of fact is, the C standard library does a lousy job processing strings: most of the string processing functions are type unsafe and tedious to use.<br />as for why C is so popular (hence this book), one is because C is relatively easy to learn and use, compared with C++, ML etc. the other reason is that unix and most unix libraries are written in C. but with virtual machine around the corner, it's time to move one level up. even though i use C all the time for writing compilers and kernel drivers, other languages like java/ ML/ python/ lisp are much more fun to use.

B00005AQE8|5.0|This is by far 2pac's best album!! Every song is off the chain. This cd has been out but I just decided to write a review today.  I think most 2pac fans will agree that \\"All Eyez on Me\\" is his best work.  I love 2pac always!!!
B00005JKNC|4.0|Jim Carrey is not one of my favorites &amp; as a matter of fact, I usually find him overacting.  But like in Truman, he outdid his stereotyped performance &amp; I believe he deserves some recognition in this film as well.<br />The film is a pure/clean entertainment, a feel good movie, a happy-ever-after film.  It embarked on the Lawson folks' hopes &amp; dreams.  Pete a.k.a. Luke &amp; the Majestic theater both embodied the full recovery of a town or a nation from a down-trodden path with full glory &amp; both have filled up the gaps &amp; bitterness in the townspeople's hearts.<br />A very simple film...nostalgic...endearing...
0312265859|2.0|I am sorry to say it, but Hard Eight was kind of lame.  Janet can do better - she's done better in the past.  Maybe she's getting tired of it, or maybe the grind of having to churn out a book a year is getting to her.  There was nothing new here.  The old tried and true antics are now just old.  Stephanie's car blowing up just isn't funny anymore.  And there was no real plot.  Stephanie wasn't really after anybody and therefore wasn't really doing anything.  And the rabbit was not anywhere near as hilarious as Janet seemed to think it was!  Spoiler warning:  The scene where Ranger and Stephanie finally \\"do it\\" was anti-climatic.  There was no emotion, no connection between the characters.  Very superficial. Very disappointing. <BR>I normally hate having to wait a year for the next installment of Stephanie's life, but this time I will be waiting two years - for the paperback intead of the hardcover.
B000002KD9|5.0|I just felt like correcting a previous review and providing my theory on the line &quot;We've Got Mother Nature on the Run&quot;.  First of all, Lynyrd Skynyrd's song &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; was a song that was a retort to Neil's song &quot;Alabama&quot; which is on the &quot;Harvest&quot; album, which by the way is another classic must-have.  As for the Mother Nature line...  The song is called &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, which refers to a time period of digging for gold, breaking up mountains and the like.  Mother Nature was on the run because we continuously destroyed her creations in search of gold!
B00005YU98|4.0|A Pagan Place is light years ahead of the debut Waterboys, but not yet at the heights they would reach on This Is The Sea.  The early sound of the band is formulating nicely, with some very strong songs here - the title track DEMANDS your full attention! The re-issue is essential for hard-core Waterboys fans who must own this for the full, unedited versions of The Thrill Is Gone &amp; All The Things She Gave Me.  The sound quality is much better on this disc than the original.  The previously unreleased tracks generally are 'interesting - for collectors only'.  However, great thanks go out to the people involved in making this re-issue - is there a &quot;This Is The Sea&quot; reissue coming?
0792837614|5.0|Did I mention that this is my favorite movie?<br />West Side Story has it all: New York, ethnic conflict, romance, music, dance, excitement, drama, laughs, even spirituality, albeit hidden.  I've loved this movie since I was a kid.<br />Recently I've seen this movie as a spiritual tug-of-war between Maria the peacemaker and Riff the warmonger, with Tony as their battleground.  Within this story of gang warfare and star-crossed romance is a story of a sheltered young girl who learns to take her faith and love beyond the prayer closet and into the streets.  Within the story Maria sends Tony, then Anita, to carry out her mission of peace, but Maria's mission has no chance until she's forced to carry it out herself--with great cost.<br />Okay, enough philosophizing.  Enjoy the movie!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight club is the grossest, weirdest, most confusingly brilliant movie I've ever seen. Incredibly intense. Fast paced. Intelligent. It is all these things and more. Also a surprise twist at the end of the film will make you think about the story in a completely different mindset.
0316666343|5.0|Susie Salmon, a 14 year old victim of a serial killer narrates her tale from heaven in one of the most imaginative tales I ever read.  She spends much of her time exploring the nature of heaven, though paradoxically, her true idea of heaven is just to be alive with her family and be able to grow up.  <br />The dead girl is constantly trying to communicate with her family and friends and to monitor their progress through life. She also wants to lead them to her killer.  Interestingly, only those who are outsiders in life are able to understand Susie's missives, which is perhaps not surprising, since Susie herself is the ultimate outsider.<br />To me, the most poignant chapter in the book describes a meeting of all the little girls currently in heaven who were murdered by this man, trying to heal themselves and each other.  Ultimately they succeed, and the book ends Susie's invective to those on earth:  &quot;I wish you a long and happy life.&quot;
B000002J5K|4.0|The Blues Brothers have always been entertaining to watch and listen to. Sure they speed up Elvis' \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" to Daytona-500 velocities, in the process dispensing with one of the  trademarks of its sound, that being HEAVY syncopation. But they make all their songs into something new - and warm, fun-loving tributes, madcap as they may be.<br /><br />Other astute performances by some of the legendary artists playing themselves in the movie [Cab Calloway, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles], take this CD right over the top. Like the movie itself, this is just plain (at times riotous) fun. Real old-timer Calloway's \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" is to die for - slick, smooth, jazzy - and yes, riotous!.<br /><br />Experienced in the context of the Blues Brothers movie itself, which was/is tremendously entertaining, all the music is a perfect fit.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I love this CD. I have been a No Doubt fan since their self-titled debut came out. I think their music keeps getting better. Rock Steady proves it. Gwen and the guys do an awesome job. I don't have a favorite song because they're all my favorite. Finally, a CD that you don't have to skip around on. You can just listen to this one forever.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Actually, my copy of the DVD is Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. (The Philosopher's stone is a real medieval legend. The title of the book and movie were changed for American audiences. British and Canadian versions have slightly different scenes were the characters say the proper name of the stone.)<br />  I have to admit, as I saw the movie I had a big smile on my face. I particularly like Ron &amp; Hermione and Hagrid, although Daniel Radcliffe makes a good Harry. Maybe a little too good. In the book, Harry is not perfect. His mistakes have been sanitized in the film.<br />  I found most of the joy I had in watching this film came straight from the book. And overall, the movie is fairly faithful. Maybe a little too much. Peter Jackson's LOTR re-imagined the novel to make it work better on film. At times, the Harry Potter film just seems like a plot summary of the book. Good -- but it doesn't quite sparkle. There is magic in the film, but it is borrowed from JK Rowling's book. LOTR creates its own magic.<br />  I also didn't like the Quidditch effect as it seemed confusing and the characters didn't mesh with the background.<br />  As for the DVD, it's nice looking. The special features -- well, I've seen discs with a lot more, but there's a good assortment here. Kids might have a lot of fun trying to find the stone and Deleted Scenes. Adults might want to just cut to the chase.<br />  Nice that the DVD has the sorting hat song. I wish the film had kept it.<br />  All in all, it's an enjoyable way to spend a few hours. I'm looking more forward to the second film.
047158651X|5.0|This book covers much of the same material as Stryer with about twice the detail and vastly better illustrations.  V&amp;V's massive advantage is a detailed methods chapter that lets you understand how the advances in biology have been made, and why science is so slow and frustrating.  If you're serious about understanding biological chemistry (as distinct from understanding how the cell works, in which case you'll want a book on molecular cell biology), look no further than this.  The third edition will be coming out in 2002, at about the same time as the sixth edition of Stryer.  Expect V&amp;V to be more up-to-date, better illustrated and less verbose than its competition (although obviously I haven't seen either yet).  If you're a medical student, try Devlin's Biochemistry with clinical correlations.  If you want an integrated cell biology/biochemistry text, try Garrett and Grisham, including part 5.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones draws the reader in from the very first lines. All the while facing the worst that humanity can offer (deception, rape, and murder), Sebold offers up a story that charms without being cloying. It is a fine line there, but she knows it, and does not overstep. Don't read too much about this book, don't think you know what's coming, because it's shocking and beautiful, masterful and different. Don't put it off, either: read this book.
078322687X|5.0|John Hughes hit the nail on the head with this dynamic and thoughtful presentation about teen angst.  The Brat Pack does an excellent job of reminding us of all the cliques in high school and why we hated them so much, including our own.<br />The movie is set, for the most part, in the high school library where our protagonists are all held together on a Saturday detention.  Over the course of nine long hours of killing time, the brain, the jock, the princess, the troublemaker and the recluse all discover that, deep down, they really are not all that different from each other: they all want to be popular, athletic, smart, rebellious and also to be left alone.<br />The antoganist, they discover, is not each other, but the high school principal, and his myopic view that kids would all be little angels if they just wrote an essay on who they really are.<br />\\"The Breakfast Club\\" is a treat for any age group from pre-teen to adult.  You will see yourself in this film, no matter when you went to high-school.  The language is coarse, the teen personalities are vulgar and the high school principal is the person we all hated but grew up to be anyway.<br />The DVD quality of this film is very good.  Although the film was shot in the early 80's and the library and furniture will look very dated, the dialogue and the angst the teens face is not bound in time.  The extras on the DVD are fairly good, and the sound quality is excellent.<br />This film will survive the test of time.  So get it for your quintessential DVD collection.  History will hold that this will become a classic.
B00005MG2Y|1.0|Don't mistake me. Linkin Park rules. While all the additional songs are great, is it really worth [the money]? What the hell?!?! I bought it for [less](okay, I bought it in Asia). 5 extra tracks (Papercut live, Points of Authority live, A Place for My Head Live, My December, and High Voltage) may be worth an additional [amount] for the rich hard-core Linkin Park fan, but downloading it off the net would be a lot cheaper.<BR>My December is somewhat like a very slow In the End, but gets tedious if you listen to it everyday. High Voltage is the black  sheep of the album, totally unrock like, but very catchy and fast pace. The live tracks are basiclly distorted versions of the original that is either annoying or else refreashing. Overall, this is an excellent album that is way over-priced.
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book--if you enjoy reading about interesting people and want for a change to read an uplifting story-yet believable try this.
0312265859|4.0|I broke down and bought this book in hardback and was not sorry for paying extra. This book was a little more serious than Seven-Up, but it was well placed when the situations became funny. As alway old and new characters played well with the new characters. Her love life has also become more complicated because I think that Stephanie is very enamored of Ranger but also still has feelings for Joe Morelli. Stephanie whatever guy you decide to be with I would love to be with the other. Keep on writing Janet  you have a brand new fan to read your books.
B00000099Y|4.0|Aenima is quite simply one of the only records I own that challenges me on an intellectual level every time I listen to it. Maynard's lyrics are intricate, often terrifying explorations into forbidden subject matter. The music is equally haunting, often spiralling into crescendos that cause one's pulse to quicken and tears to spring to one's eye.<br />Tool is metal with a small M, not the Death/Grind/Aggro kind. It's okay for Tool to have it's own category; they've earned it by breaking the genre. You're not cool because you listen to Tool, you simply have an appreciation for cool and ground-breaking music. Every song on the album packs an emotional and musical punch, especially \\"Forty-Six and 2\\", \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" and \\"Eleven\\".<br />\\"Aenima\\" is a song that pays homage to Bill Hicks' excellent comedy record \\"Arizona Bay\\", which is what will be left when LA falls into the ocean. Maynard's lyrics nail every single thing that is wrong with Los Angeles, while the music rages and writhes to complement the sentiments.<br />The songs that are actually songs are excellent. By all rights, this album should deserve 5 stars. HOWEVER: I was at first startled by and later put off by all the short songs packed in between the ones of substance. Every single one is deadwood and could have been chopped to reveal the true core of Aenima: the insightful and powerful music that is classic Tool. Many bands have done this (or the \\"Hidden Track\\" thing), with varying degrees of success. Most are pointless, and muddle what may be an excellent album.<br />Tool is, in my mind, one of the most brilliant bands of the past decade. While their style may not tickle everyone, I think the overwhelming majority of positive reviews on this page shows that Tool are truly a heavyweight in the music world and a true force to be reckoned with.
0316666343|5.0|I expected something amazing from The Lovely Bones because of all the literary buzz but nothing I read could capture the sheer exhilaration of opening the book and discovering a new literary voice.  I shouldn't say literary because the writing is so effortless and real that it feels more like breathing someone else's air.  The book is so original I felt as if Sebold was inventing a new writing form.  I can't imagine what her influences are because I have never read anything like this book.
B00005JKNF|2.0|This movie was just painful to sit through.  No real conflict is established until the murder is committed.  It's just a bunch of ppl arguing with a bad parallel between the servants and their masters.  There is nothing witty or even funny about the writing. There is no real mystery at all when he is killed because of the emphasis on a particular character and half the characters could've been taken out to move the movie along.  The entire first hour sets up almost nothing and is just filler.  However, Altman saved this wretched script by producing superb shots.  That is the only redeeming quality about the movie.
B00003ZKS1|5.0|This release stands the test of time perfectly!  I bought this on LP when it came out in 1980, and actually saw this tour live in NY and NJ.  It was incredible!  I believe it was Molly Hatchet, MSG, and Kiss, and without question, MSG blew the other bands out of the water!  I am 40 years old, and a hard rock/metal afficionado since I was in high school (one of my fave genres).  After hearing hard rock, blues hard rock, progressive hard rock, death hard rock, grunge, nu-metal, (fill in the blank), I always go back to this release because it is, quite possibly, one of the BEST hard rock/metal release EVER!  The songs are well structured, the drumming is clockwork and powerful, as is the heartfelt, megastrong vocals of Gary Barden, and the ungodly talented axework from the master himself, Mister/Master Michael Schenker.  This is one of those CD's that send chills up my spine when I hear what Michael is doing on the guitar!  His ability to sustain melodic intensity in both rhythm and lead playing WITH a hard, bluesy meets metal approach is indicative of a true master on guitar!  It is high time the Limp Bizkits of the world truly learn how to play artistic, connecting, emotive hard rock... the way it should be done like the Schenkers, Lifesons, Iommis, Pages, Tiptons, Jon Roths, Jabs, Murrays, Hammetts, Takasakis, Malmsteens, Buck Dharma Roesers, and Blackmores of the world (to name a few of the absolute best)!
B00003CXQY|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  Disney has redeemed themselves!  This movie if full of humor for both children and adults.  I haven't seen this much creativity out of Disney in quite some time.  Now...as long as they don't make a sequel to this movie, I will continue to love it!<br />The basic run down....the emperor is a big jerk, who is selfish and only thinks of himself.  He wants to build a pool house on the top of this mountain and kicks the inhabitants of that land out.  Little does the emperor know, but his assistant and her stupid side kick are plotting to kill him.  Instead they turn him into a llama!  He ends up in a bag on the top of the wagon of one of the citizens he has kicked out.  The two end up having to work together to try to find their way back to the castle so the emperor can reclaim his thrown.<br />Will they work together to make it back?  Or is the emperor to stubborn to get along with someone who is willing to help?  I don't want to give away the ending, so I will let you see for yourself!  Trust me...you won't regret the time spent watching this movie!
B000066C1N|5.0|This must be the best Soundtrack CD out there. The songs sung by Bryan Adams have intence feeling in them. With Sound The Bugle you feel the ups and downs in the tone and speed of the music. The songs a beautifully writen and sung.<br />Sigh, what can I say about Hans Zimmer's music. It is the most peaceful thing to listen to. The tones of the music are so smoth the you can plays those tracks for a baby to fall asleep to. They are wildly praised and the havev a right to be. Let's hope Hans Zimmer continues to right this beautiful music.
B000066NW0|5.0|I'm so glad we have Avril Lavigne in the singing scene because at first I sadly thought she'd be another Alanis. I  was wrong, Avril's CD &quot;Let Go&quot;, is great because I related to it and she writes her own lyrics, she speaks the truth and if she wants to say something she says it to your face!! I love Avril Lavigne and her CD is not meant to be sitting on shelves collecting dust!! BUY IT!! :)
630512762X|4.0|This is one of John Woo's best Hollywood movie. Great story, great action and lots of gun-play. My only gripe is the actress playing Archer's wife. She looked a bit too old for either Travolta or Cage. If only they had casted another better looking actress to play Archer's wife. Other than that, this movie is well recommended.
B000002BUY|5.0|This hands down my favorite Incubus album. With its surprisingly intricate balance between indie rock and near metal with melodic overtones one can't help but love it. To anyone looking to start an Incubus collection, but just can't figure out which album to start with, THIS IS THE ONE!!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I love Denzell Washington's work, including that in &quot;Training Day&quot;, but his performance in that film was not the caliber shown by Russell Crowe in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.  Just outstanding work.  I think Denzell Washington is an Oscar-quality actor, but in this case it seems that the Oscar was given to the most-liked actor instead of the best performance.  That's a shame.<br />Is Denzell Washington more likeable than Russell Crowe?  Probably.  Did Crowe make some unwise remarks prior to the Oscars?  Most definitely.  Should any of that have higher weight than his on-screen performance?  Never.<br />I hope Denzell wins another Oscar someday, free of the the political tarnish that seems to cover this one.  But in my mind, the Oscar should've gone to Russell Crowe for a beautiful performance in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.
B000002GQG|5.0|This album is so undescribable. See, it came right after Days of Future Passed (which was also excellent), and I believe the band may have been a bit more comfortable because now they had a record deal and everything. Justin's voice seems to have matured in some way- yet he sounds the same. I say this because if there was a song that ever made me cry it would be The Actor. By far the greatest song on the album (but the whole thing is fantastic). The sound of Justin's voice is so mysterious. He sounds so sad, and then the words are so emotional. I die when Justin sings- The sound I've heard in you hello-oh darling, you're almost part of me, oh darling, you're all I'll ever see.<BR>Yeah! So buy the CD, you'll have no regrets. Moodies albums are the only ones I can listen to from beginning to end, usually I find myself skipping around on the CD's of other artist's- not so here. Enjoy. Oh and I would have given it all of the stars in the universe, but that's just not physically possible.
B00005MP58|5.0|Excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's novel.  Austen fans will want to watch this again and again.  Anyone who liked Bridget Jones' Diary should watch this and see how it all began.
B000066NW0|5.0|I really didn't think I was going to like Avril's music, but once I heard the first few lines of Sk8ter Boi, I was hooked. It's a great CD with new look and attitude for girl rockers. Avril's voice is full of emotion and life. I amazed at her talents at such a young age.
B00005ABIP|5.0|Prolonging the Magic is not only the best Cake album, it is one of the best albums of all time. You will never get sick of any song on the CD, not even the two big singles, Never There and Sheep Go To Heaven. You will immediately be addicted to the first seven tracks and won't want to go past them. But this isn't were the magic ends. This is a great album all the way through especially with Gabe Nelson's amazing bass riffs in Hem of Your Garment and Cool Blue Reason. Prolonging the Magic's amazing lyrics and simple guitar parts mix perfectly with the complicated sounding bass parts that will blow your mind. Singer John McCrea's low, raspy voice fits his lyrics perfectly. I strongly recommend this album to anyone with any taste in music (excluding rap fiends).
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have loved No doubt for 9 years, everything they do is great.  This new album is fantastic, Gwen has mastered her voice and Tom, Adrian, and Tony have improved their instrumentation since the beginning of No Doubt.  I love the new sounds and highly reccomend it to everyone.
B000062XM7|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I liked it right away. It had this intensity and sense of adventure right from the beginning. Mixed with a passionate love story between two people, this movie is one of the best out there. <br />The story is based on a famous novel everyone heard about. Basically there is a war going on in the America between the French and English. Entangled in this fight are also brutal Huron indians, led by Magua. Hawkeye is a white, raised by indian tribe since his early childhood. When he, his &quot;brother&quot; Uncas and his &quot;father&quot; Chingachkook, save Munroe's daughters, Cora and Alice, from the indians, Cora and Hawkeye soon fall in love.<br />What else am I supposed to say to this one? Fantastic movie, great actors, absolutely beautiful music - everything an adventurous and historical movie should have. Grade A+ - period.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This 2 disc set is one of the best available, not to mention its a Star Wars movie.  The picture and sound are fantastic, espescially when viewed and heard on a high def. 57&quot; widescreen with surround sound.  Each lightsaber strike is crisp and clear, as though it were happening live in front of you.  The second disc has tons of special features including deleted scenes, movie posters from around the world, extended scenes, and the music video for &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;.  Though this might not be considered the greatest of the Star Wars movies, the movie is dramatically enhanced when viewed on DVD.
B000066NW0|5.0|Into a world of pop divas comes a fresh and funky skater girl by the name of Avril Lavigne.  Her debut album \\"Let Go\\" was released on June 4, 2002, and it displays just how talented and how real this 17 year old Canadian girl is.<br /> The CD starts off with a song called \\"Losing Grip\\".  My favorite thing about this song is the power of Avril's vocals.  \\"Losing Grip\\" is a story of rejection, and a hurtful relationship.  The emotion in this song is gripping, and you can feel and relate to the pain from this rejection.<br /> The album continues with Avril's hit single \\"Complicated\\".  It's a guitar driven song about a friend trying to be someone they aren't.  For me, \\"Complicated\\" is one of those songs that I could listen to over and over and never become tired of it.  It's an experience that most of us go through, and Avril tells the story perfectly.<br /> Next up on the album is my favorite song, \\"Sk8er Boi\\".  This song has an amazing story behind it, driven by an awesome beat.  It's about a popular, preppy girl, and, hence the name, a skater boy.  The two are both attracted to each other, but the girl's friends don't approve of him, so she ignores her feelings for him.  Later on in life, while the girl is home watching TV, she sees the skater boy in a rock band on MTV.  She then realizes what she missed out on, and the song ends with Avril dating the boy and telling the girl just how awesome he really is.<br /> Each and every song on this album holds a meaning and a story that's real, that most people can relate to, and I think that's my favorite thing about Avril.  This is one album that isn't full of meaningless songs about having the perfect guy, the perfect life, and being in love.  It confronts the hard parts of life too, and it's definitely a refreshing change.<br /> \\"Let Go\\" includes mellow songs like \\"Unwanted\\", \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Too Much To Ask\\" and \\"Naked\\".  These songs are perfect to put on when you're sad, frustrated, or when you just need to vent.<br />Another of my favorite songs on this album is \\"Nobody's Fool\\".  It's about being in a relationship with someone, and that person is trying to change you into someone else.  Avril then tells this person that she has to be herself, and if that's not good enough for him or her, then they can leave at any time.  I think this song has a great message that it's okay to just be who you are, no matter what anyone else thinks.<br /> I highly recommend this CD to everyone, whether you are a guy or a girl, young or old.  Avril's music is real, and brilliant, which can be appreciated by anyone.  ...
0451527712|4.0|It's surprising how little this grim, melodramatic novel has in common with many of the horror movies it inspired.  The theory that it's a warning of science and technology going awry is, I think, an overstatement of its prophetic capacity.  Mary Shelley's novel does not appear to have much of an interest in science per se, and is less about creation than it is about the relationship between the creator and the created.<br />The novel's structure is indirect for reasons that become apparent at its end.  An English sea captain named Walton is writing letters to his sister, telling her about a man his ship has rescued from an abandoned ice floe on a polar expedition.  The man's name is Victor Frankenstein, and he commences to tell Walton his Long Story...<br />Intensely interested in science as a boy growing up in Geneva, Victor fulfilled his studies at a university and hoped to make some earth-shattering scientific breakthrough.  He decides that a fascinating project would be to find a way to re-animate the dead.  Collecting body parts from charnel houses and assembling them into a gigantic golem, he manages to bring this thing to life (refusing to disclose the scientific method).  Fearful and regretful of the powerful outcome of his experiment, he is relieved when the monster walks mutely and mindlessly out of his apartment, never to return.  Oddly enough, over the next two years, he is not concerned with where the monster has gone or what it is doing.<br />When his youngest brother, William, is murdered, Victor suspects his monster; vacationing in the Alps a few months later, he comes across the monster, who not only has learned to talk but has become quite eloquent.  The monster tells Victor that his many efforts to befriend people and enter into society have been spurned due to his frightening appearance, and his resulting loneliness and anger incited him to kill.  He insists that Victor, as his creator, has an obligation to provide him with a female companion, and demands that he make one for him.  However, Victor is unwilling to add to the population of violent creatures, and the monster takes his revenge out on even more of Victor's loved ones.  Distraught to the point of insanity, Victor turns vigilante and pursues the monster all over the world, swearing to destroy it once and for all.<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is an allegorical tale of creation and examines a creator's responsibility and accountability for his creation's deeds or misdeeds.  In this regard, Victor is essentially an irresponsible creator.  He is not concerned with his monster's whereabouts until after one of his siblings is murdered; he could have taken responsibility for his creature immediately upon creation, but shortsightedly chose not to.  The monster, on the other hand, was essentially a good creature until human society made him miserable and vengeful; in terms of his emotions, his intelligence, and his vindictiveness, he's ironically the most \\"human\\" character in the novel.

B000002MJC|1.0|I don't know what happened, but this is Depeche Mode's worst album ever. This album is a Depeche Mode fan's worst nightmare.<BR>Hideous! This album is so bad that it does not even desereve a star. The music in this CD is nothing like Depeche Mode in terms of the unique musical quality that the band is known for.<BR>The band went astray into a musical direction that wasn't theirs.<BR>They should have left that wretched world of music to the several bands that are out there that cater to that type of music. It was obvious that the band was going through hard times in their career and personal lives that they put out this monstrosity of an album. Unfortunately this would be the last album that Depeche Mode would make with member Alan Wilder who left the group in 1995. Maybe this album is the reason why he left the group. Discard this CD. This is not normal Depeche Mode music... Songs of Faith and Devotion is hazardous to your ears and health. What a horrible album!

B000002KN8|4.0|This is Depeche Mode's introductory album into the world of music and recording artists.  A very pleasant and enjoying album to listen to contains one of the band's best loved tracks by fans of all time, Just Can't Get Enough.  Speak and Spell is more of a boing and bounce electronic type album in which is slightly different than the rest of the material the band would put out throughout their career. Never the less Speak and Spell clearly introduces the electronic style of music that would characterize Depeche Mode.  At this time in the beginning of DM's career Vince Clark from Erasure was a member and principle song writer for the group.  His unique lyrics are pleasnt and interesting to listen to especially since most of the time they make no sense.  The track Dreaming of Me is one of the highlights of this album with words that make no sense, but great chirpy and bouncy music that sounds as if you were watching a cartoon.  When you come to the beautiful and subtle track of Any Second Now you are introduced to the heavenly voice of member Martin Gore who would become the group's song writer following the departure of Vince Clark in 1982.<BR>A good debut album from one of the best recording bands in music.

B00006879E|3.0|Kara's Flowers, the predecessor to Maroon 5, was one of the great late 90's power pop bands, something like a jazzy Fountains of Wayne.  It was really catchy rock music that seemed to be getting better with age, as they learned more about instrumentation and songwriting.  It seems they have learned more than they probably should have, because this album is heavily twinged with R&B influences.  Now maybe I can be accused of hating new things, but I think there are enough R&B boybands out there already, and it saddens me that there is one less certifiably great rock band than there used to be, in an era when there are already way too few. (Let it be mentioned that while the boyband sound is there, the lyrics are still infinitely deeper and more personal than that shallow boyband rubbish)<br />But, this band deserves room to grow in whichever direction they choose, and some of the songs are downright beautiful (\\"She will be Loved\\"). I just hope I can get used to the sound of that soul-funk guitar.  If you are into R&B influenced pop music, you might just find this c.d. to be amazing.  But if you want really catchy rock and roll, find Kara's Flowers' \\"The Fourth World\\" or track down their phenomenal \\"Stagg St. Recordings\\"
0812580346|3.0|Coming up with original and interesting storylines in science fiction is always difficult.  So as an avid sci-fi reader I found the basic idea very fascinating.<br />That is where it ends.  The scientific theories etc. in the book are well thought out and presented very well but the characters are extremely one dimensional and for intelligent people, their quests for the truth are nonsensical.  Why read chapters in a book when it adds nothing new to the story and does not move the plotline along?<br />The ending of a book is obviously very important.  No matter how intriguing the rest of the book has been, you have to get it right.  Robert J. Sawyer's attempt to be profound fails miserably and it just ends up being corny.<br />Buy this one at a garage sale.
B00000269M|5.0|Following up a blockbuster like &quot;Thriller&quot; would have been impossible for anyone, but Michael Jackson proved he was more than up to the task! While the much touted Stevie/Michael duet is the only real sin here, the rest of &quot;Bad&quot; is quite good! There are no filler tracks, and even at it's sappiest (&quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;) this work is still transcendent. My favorite cuts are the biting indictment of &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; (still the best video of his career!),&quot;Speed Demon&quot; (cheesy yes, but also catchy as heck)and the slow, bubbling passion of &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; (should have been a single). &quot;Bad&quot; is essentially a greatest hits package covering '87-'89 since 5 tracks here were number 1's and everthing here was worthy of release as a hit or B-side. Just chalk this up as another Jackson classic, not as consistently great as &quot;Thriller&quot;, but a worthy sequel.
1567184855|5.0|George Patton believed he was a warrior in many previous life experiences, and I think he found a profound truth.  This is an interesting side journey into the times between each life that perhaps prepared him for his greatest battle and victory.  Follow your instincts.

I love this film i like to see more of them
B00003CXI1|4.0|I admit I wished my son would have discovered the new Star Wars with the same enthusiasm as I did the old back in the late 70s.  The mythology of the films stay with me and influence me today.<br />My son, however, has adopted his own franchise of fantasy and being a fan of Harry Potter, he's found his own lifelong menagerie of creatures and cast of characters to enjoy.  He has his own series of epic adventures to enjoy with characters like Dumbledore and Hagrid, friends like Hermoine and Ron, monsters like Fluffy and such vivid imagery that capture and mold a young boy's imagination.<br />The DVD set encourages your participation in the adventure.  A most interactive DVD, it features potion-mixing, treasure hunting, and a search for the &quot;Sorcerer Stone&quot;... quite nicely engineered.<br />And J.K. Rowling is a hottie.
B00005A46T|1.0|Slipknot is the best band to act like 9 overgrown 3 year olds, screaming like there is no tomorrow about very cool things like \\"If you're a 555, then I'm a 666\\" and \\"People equal shxt\\", screaming like their Mommies took away their toys and made them sit in time-out corner, not to mention run around on stage and beat eachother sensless with dead birds and dead goats heads while only 4 members are actually trying to play their instruments but fail to do so anyway. Yep...I can really relate to these cow pattie-shoveling Iowa goons who have nothing better to do then make songs about nothing but teen-angst, even if Korn did that 7 years ago...Yep Slipknot is really the most talented band I have heard since Milli Vanilli...all gimmick and no talent! ... Yep...Slipknot is the new band for us clueless, teen-angst filled fans of today! May the trendy bands keep on coming!
B000002UA0|5.0|It's hard to imagine an album more different from the anonymous, arena space-rock Pink Floyd would perfect after the departure of troubled front man and primary songwriter Syd Barrett.<br />Piper, by contrast, is the realization of an intensely personal vision, and the combination of Barrett's whimsical poetry, his unconventional song structures, and a sonic landscape sculpted with the aid of plenty of hallucinogens resulted in one of the most audacious, endearing, and erratically brilliant albums in the history of rock Õn' roll.
B00005RYKV|3.0|I recently rented Brother on DVD here in america last week. And was saddened to find that they edited a fair amount of scenes from the original version. The movie still functions with the scenes edited out, but I felt that these edited scenes brought more clarity to the movie. The edited amereican version doesn't quite have that clarity, and therefore suffers somewhat. The edited scenes were mostly in Japanese, and gave background on why Takeshi's character was going to LA. . Perhaps the studio felt that american viewers do not like to read subtitles or don't like seeing people in other countries. I am not sure why this was done, but I think that it takes away from the movie and shortchanges the viewer. Anyhow, it is Takeshi being Takeshi, and the movie is well done. Not a bad crossover film for Takeshi and Kitano. It's rather humourous at times and there is enough bad [butt]edness going around to make even the seasoned action flix fan happy. I would give it 5 stars had they not messed with it and edited scenes from the original.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind finally gives us a reason for Ron Howard to stay in the game. Some of his earlier work (Backdraft, Apollo 13, Ransom) I absolutely thought was trash. I dont mean to be so hipocritcal, but its just my opinion. But then came \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" and now \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". To say the least this film deserved the Oscar for Best Director and Best Picture. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for Jennifer Connelly, who did a tremendous job. But as fate would have it, it lost Best Actor. Which Im not really throwing everything down on Denzel Washington, because he did turn in a quite great performance, but if you see both you will see why Russell Crowe should have won it hands down. This true story is about a brilliant Nobel Prize winning mathematician John Nash (Russell Crowe) who after several years without treatment finds out he has schizophrenia. Along with the help of his beautiful wife (Jennifer Connelly) John tries to beat the schizophrenia with willpower. Which like he says \\"its just a problem without a answer. That all. I solve problems, remember?\\" If you havent seen this work of art yet, you should do so. Its filled with brilliant performances and yet a great DVD to put in the collection.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie follows the book word for word.  The attention to detail is amazing, I felt like I was back in the army!  Having known close friends who served in Somalia, I wanted this movie to be accurate...to tell their story right.  This movie does just that.  Many people who never served in the military may have a tough time appreciating this film.  But EVERYONE that I know that served in the military and has watched this movie thought that it was excellent, accurate, and true to life.  I recommend this movie to all prior servicemen, you won't be let down.
0684801558|5.0|In this novel, F. Scott Fitzgerald is extremely cruel with his characters and society. A young couple of the generation that came of age just before the First World War, were both born in extremely rich families and were educated for the vainest of all lives, high life and no work. They only knew the value of money for what its possession could provide them with : luxury, parties, alcohol, shows, etc. But they did not know at all what working to earn it could mean. Fitzgerald explores in the tiniest details the descent to hell for these two young people and what they considered as their final salvation (the inheritance from the grandfather was finally given back to them by courts). But they have been dragged so low in their vain attempt at surviving without doing anything while waiting for the court decision, that they are plain misfits in society. They have a lot of money and can be wooed and courted by other members of the aristocratic class, but they are despised and they despise all the others. No moral or even social salvation, just a golden version of hell on earth. This novel is a masterpiece in explaining and showing how the education of a young man or a young girl is entirely responsible for the personalities and behaviors these young people will develop later on in life. Hence it is a deep book on education, the education of the children of the rich. They have to conquer their inheritance through their own achievements and efforts or work. This book by Fitzgerald is definitely the best I have read, so far, because it shows these simple truths in the cruellest and most unadorned painting...
0060934700|5.0|On a first reading of a short story compilation, I read every story front-to-back. I make my decisions as to what I like and what I can live without, and on subsequent readings, I often head straight to the highlights. The stories that grabbed me the first time.<br />Not so with Smoke and Mirrors. When I revisit this one, I read the entire thing cover to cover all over again. I've looked over and over for a weakness in this compilation but can't seem to find it. The introduction is not only amusing in its own right, but added to my enjoyment of the stories by giving a little background info on each piece. Where the ideas came from, what Gaiman thinks about it now that it's done, etc.<br />The best thing I can say about the stories themselves is that each one is enjoyable and unique. I get aggravated with some compilations because every story is only slightly different than the one before it. Not so with Smoke and Mirrors. Each piece follows different conventions, is written in a different style. There are rondels and modern fairy tales, pulp stories and narrative poems. I might go so far as to say that there is a story for every taste in here.<br />Still unsure about whether this is for you? If you can get your hands on a copy, read &quot;Nicholas Was...&quot; It's only 100 words long. And it's oh-so-worth-it.
0446677450|5.0|First of all, it is so obvious that this is really just 1 person repeatly posting.<br />But hey guy, the book is still selling. People love this book. If you took the time to read, you would too.<br />This book turned my life around. I used to think that a college degree equalled success. But, I was willing to be corrected.<br />RTK--Great book. I just purchased CASH Flow Quadrant and will do a review after I have finished reading it.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Look, people stop complaining about the songs that aren't on the cd look them up and download them it's not that hard they can be found quite easily. Anyway aside from that I loved the cd it starts off wonderfully and ends the same way. I was tempted to not watch the movie simply because it was a musical and I find them not to my liking but then I found out that Ewan McGregor was in it and decided what the hey. I ended up loving it and I then got the soundtrack simply for the songs that Ewan did but then I found that the other were well done. I would recommend this cd for anyone to get.
0316666343|5.0|First time novelist Alice Sebold somehow illuminates hope emanating from grief and beauty emanating from despair. Her poetic style and tender story of love and intimacy are reminiscent of Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. I recommend both highly.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is by far the most creative of Incubus' albums. With tracks such as &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Are You In?&quot;, you can just about tell that Incubus is gonna take off even more.<br />It seems like Incubus has such an intellect about them now. Fungus Amongus and some of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was really hard core. It seems that after Make Yourself and Morning View, Incubus still has an awesome music-making ability. After ten years of trying, they finally did it! Morning View rocks!<br />                ~Megan C., 16
B000068R1X|1.0|Ozzy and Sony have done it again.  Another 5-star album has been ruined!  This reissue was remixed with some guitar parts deleted (for example, the first half of the intro solo to \\"Rock 'n' Roll Rebel\\" has been eliminated.)  The keyboards in the beginning of \\"Waiting for Darkness\\" have been boosted up so loud that you can barely hear the churning guitar riff below.  These are just two of the things that have been changed.  \\"Bark at the Moon\\" has been drastically altered.  \\"Centre of Eternity\\" has been drastically altered.  I can't believe they would have done this after the fiasco with the Blizzard and Diary reissues.  Once again, there has been no mention of the altering on the CD's sticker or advertising.  No, Sir, I don't like it.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This has to be one of the most intriguing films of the last twenty years. The stellar cast includes Chazz Palmintieri, Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro. The viewer follows the story along with the Detective (Palmintieri) trying to figure out (the now infamous question) &quot;Who is Keyser Soze? (the most fearsome mobster to leave the Eastern block) as the events leading up to a cocaine heist are told by the gimp legged Kint (Spacey). The twists and turns (right up until the end) in the story keep you on your toes as the suspense draws you into the drama. A masterful script, well directed with lots of action, and yet, the most intriguing part is the brilliantly crafted (both in performance and page) characterizations. I found this film riveting and recommend it highly.
B00005UEAR|2.0|This is not a CD for true Dream Theater fans.  For everyone who remebers the good ol days of &quot;Images&quot; and &quot;Awake,&quot; this album falls way short.  The cd has a few moments, but not enough to justify ownership.  The band sacrafices much needed melodie for Pantera style riffs and self-indulgent soloing.  What I have come to appreciate about the band -- strong melodies, nice grooves, and the utmost of musicianship -- is all but completely missing in this current installment.  This CD doesn't represent true progressive music, that which DT has epitomized in the past.  Very disappointed.
B000002JSN|5.0|Back in the 70's, bands delivered there major statements on double albums.  Physical Graffiti most certainly stands as the pinacle of Led Zeppelins career(and thus of Rock).  This album delivered all the things that made Led Zeppelin a unique, popular and influencial group.  You want guitar epics, try In My Time of Dying.  Experimental sounds?  Listen to Kashmir and In the Light.  Laid back songs?  Ten Years Gone.  And that is just some of the highlights.  Some claim that this is padded with filler.  I would say that it is grade A filler that most bands would kill for.  As a testament, I have owned this release in three different formats (album, cassette and CD) and it still gets plenty of play some 25 years after I originally purchased it.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I AM A HUGE FAN OF THIS MOVIE. I've always been an avid fan of all the Tombraider Video Games so I was sooo siked when this movie came out. Angelina Jolie performs stunts even the stunt doubles had trouble with- she did most if not all of them herself. She's a great actress, especially in this. Wait until you see how she taught herself how to flip her guns into her holsters. Very impressive. If I could give more stars on this rating I would, as 5 just doesn't do it justice. I've become such a huge fan of Angelina Jolie since this movie I am in the process of buying all her movies. She's my idol. If you watch this, she'll be your idol too!! DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE TOMB RAIDER VIDEO GAMES! THEY'RE DEFINETLY TIME WELL SPENT.
B000001FZK|5.0|LAUGHING STOCK, Talk Talk's last release, is the jewel of their collection.  Their metamorphisis from a run of the mill Synth-Pop outfit to a wholley original sound, which still sounds ahead of their time, was amazing.  Using a wide pallete of sounds and especially silences, unique instrumentation and moods, Talk Talk had created a record of rare beauty.  I doubt if many people have heard this record, but I'm sure that those that have, hold it in high regard.
B000065U1N|4.0|It was a good idea to make a movie about a small but bloody conflict that was heard about in 1992-93 but was almost forgotten by the people. Black Hawk Down may be the only movie ever made explaining about the U.S. intervention into the Civil War of Somalia but most of the movie shows nothing but endless gunfights leading to several U.S. soldiers getting wounded and killed, which is sometimes shown in a tragic, dramatic form. The movie is pretty much accurate compared to the actual event in history but just because the movie shows an almost complete accuracy doesn't mean it is going to have a lot of positive praise. Sure, I think this movie was good, it teaches you a little history, showing that the U.S. has tried to help African countries by military aid, the gunfights were cool, seeing how a Delta Force makes a raid was interesting, and the movie doesn't only put it through the American prespective, but also, a little bit through the Somali prespective also. The thing Black Hawk Down was lacking was the acting. There's not much conversation between the soldiers since they put so much emphasis on what the battle actually looked like and what the harrowing experience was like. Then there's the characters. There are so many people in the movie and it is kind of hard to keep track on who's who in the battle. Minus one star for that. Overall, the movie is good, if it won two Oscars for Sound and Best Film Editing, then it's got to have cool sound and the filming has to be well developed. This movie is not recommended for children, because of the graphic violence and the language but wait until they are at least 12-13 and are willing to deal with all this terrible stuff, learn about history and war, and just enjoy the cool gunfights. Just don't let your girlfriend watch this movie unless she likes these types of movies.
047158651X|5.0|I started reading Voet and Voet a few months ago, in preparation for a transition into computational biology that I'll make making soon.  The book is quite detailed, which is useful to me as a researcher, because it lets me get up to speed on the current state of biochemical knowledge without having to read too many papers first.  As a class textbook, however, I can understand why it might not be an optimal choice.  The level of detail can be overwhelming, and obscures the big picture.  In my case, I'm looking to study specific biochemical structures and systems, so the more detail provided, the better.
B000003S2K|5.0|this piece, while intended to be background music (or as erik satie would have called it, &quot;furniture music&quot;), deserves a listening with 100% devoted attention.  the incredible detail paid to the alignment of repetitions, the subtle changes which take place over vast scapes of time, and the beautiful, transcendent melodic and harmonic structures which coalesce into one amalgamation make this into what i (and many) would consider to be one of the best albums i own, and far and away my favourite &quot;electronic&quot; album of all time.  given the right set of circumstances, this piece can make you smile, make you cry, or make you forget where you are and what you're doing.  definitely one of the few perfect works out there.
6300214184|3.0|Flashdance is a classic merely for its soundtrack.  The poor acting, and the disappointingly obvious body-doubles used during her more intense dance scenes are just some of the movie's downfalls.  A significant part of the plot revolves around a budding affair of the barely 18-year-old protagonist/welder/exotic dancer being seduced by her day-time employer acts as the other crippling drawback.
6300215814|5.0|It looks, however, like Breakfast at Tiffany's has taken over the #1 slot. <br />I'm fourteen and totally NOT interested in the shallow movies of today. (I've always been more interested in the past; I love biographies of actresses like Jean Harlow.)  So I took a trip to my local Blockbuster and rented this movie, along with Casablanca.  (I didn't like that movie, surprisingly.) <br />I popped B@T in my VCR first, and that image of Audrey as Holly eating that danish in the window of Tiffany's had me hooked.  Now, I didn't think any movie could be better than Moulin Rouge.  This one just might be.<br />I adore Holly and Cat, and I adore \\"Varjak, Paul\\" just the same.  The entire cast is just WONDERFUL (Buddy Ebsen, who was supposed to be in my 4th favorite movie of all time, The Wizard of Oz, plays Doc Golightly, Holly's ex-husband and makes a great appearance.)<BR>The first meeting between Holly and Paul is my favorite, with her getting ready to visit Sally Tomato and him helping her find her black alligator shoes.  And the last scene, with the two searching for Cat and kissing in the rain (with Cat between them, looking none too happy), has got to be one of the most romantic scenes EVER.  <br />I found myself hating Holly when she told Paul she was going to marry José (thank GOD she didn't!), feeling so sad for him during the Doc fiasco, laughing as they stole those two masks from the 5 and 10 cent store, and finally, sighing at the close.  <br />Breakfast at Tiffany's is a wonderful movie from beginning to end.  <BR>I STRONGLY advise you to buy/rent this, and while you're at it, check out Moulin Rouge too.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I loved the movie.  I was very disappointed with the build up  before the release of the movie in the theaters.  They  said it was very  true to the book.  I found a lot of stuff deleted and new things added.  I still found the movie to be very enjoyable.  I'm glad i bought it.  The movies is very different from the book.
0441172717|1.0|I know this is considered a classic and one of the supreme Sci-Fi novels of all time and that's why I was excited to read it.  However, I found it boring and disjointed.  Some of the characters are interesting and the story has it's moments but it's not worth the time it takes to read it.  The story spends too much time building up to events which are either unsatisfying or over the top.  The main character was extremely shallow and what personality he did have was still obscure.  I didn't care for him at all.  He seemed to be as bored as I was with the things going on around him.  The book had good concepts but they were never really put to good use.  I really wanted this book to be good.  I was on it's side to begin with, but now I can see why Herbert had such a hard time finding someone to publish it.
B000063CPL|4.0|I have to admit it, I was very surprised how<BR>good this album is.  The song selection could be<BR>a little better (nothing from Somewhere in Time?!?<BR>too much BNW), but still, if you want more of the<BR>classic Maiden, pick up Live After Death.  Overall:<br />1)Bruce sounds amazing.  It's like it's 1985 or something.<br />2)Nikko sounds better than ever.  Better than Live After<BR>  Death even.<br />3)The newer songs (post Somewhere in Time) sound fantastic.<BR>  The older stuff though sounds worse.  Too many guitars,<BR>  not crisp sounding, like it should be.  <br />4)lose Jannick Gerhs, please.<br />5) The inside needs more pictures of the show.  That's minor,<BR>   but it could have been better.<br />Overall, a very worthy cd.  UP THE IRONS!!!

B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's latest album is one of the best albums released in 2001. Shakira has that special sound and a unique way of singing. Most of her songs are written by herself. In my opinion Shakira is the best Latin artist of the past few years and she's going to have an even more brilliant career.<BR>In Cyprus she became well-known after this successful album, Laundry Service and her hit-single \\"Whenever, Wherever\\". I heard of her in 1999 for the first time. Her first song I had listened to was \\"Ojos Asi\\". (The english version of \\"Ojos Asi\\" is included in this album, entitled \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" and although I prefer the spanish version as it is more powerful, I like \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" very much.) Since then I managed to get all of her CDs and I even managed to download some of her very early songs included in her first albums \\"Magia\\" and \\"Peligro\\" (=danger) that are very rare and it's impossible to buy from Cyprus or Greece. I really loved all of her music. Though \\"Pies Descalzos\\" and \\"Donde Estan los Ladrones?\\" were awesome, \\"Laundry Service\\" is her best. She made a really great cross-over album, unlike most foreign artists who unsuccessfully try a world-wide career. Her english accent is good enough and her english lyrics are great.<BR>My personal favourite of this album is the ballad \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\". \\"Objection (Tango)\\" is a rhythmic powerful song, existing also in a spanish version, \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio\\". The hit of this album is \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" or \\"Suerte\\" in spanish. \\"Lucky you were born that far away so we could both make fun of distance / Lucky that I love a foreign land for the lucky fact of your existenceLucky that my breasts are small and humble so you dont confuse em with mountains  her lyrics may sound a little weird to an english-speaker, but I find them special. Rules, Ready For The Good Times, Fool and Poem To A Horse are great songs written in english, with her own unique music style and poetic lyrics. Also, there are two new spanish songs, Te Dejo Madrid and Que Me Quedes Tu. I believe that all of her songs have something special. Her albums are not like some other artists that contain only two or three hit songs and the rest of them is just there to complete the album. Shakiras songs have something special.<BR>I consider Laundry Service as the BEST music album I have.
B00005N53P|5.0|What can you say about a debut album, as convincing as this. You have already read about them in all the music papers, and rightly so, because when you first hear The Strokes debut album 'Is This It' you don't know what to do with yourself. Jump, scream, hop about the room or run to your next door neighbour and tell them all about it. It starts off slowly with title track 'Is This It', but when the crunching intro to 'The Modern Age' hits you, you just want to get down and boogie. Track after track, your feet and hands get sorer with all the tapping being done. Make sure when you buy this album you get plenty of sleep the night before because I can guarantee that when you hear 'Is This It' your stereo will keep on playing all night long.
B00005MP58|5.0|if you love Jane Austen & Pride & Prejudice, there is no way you can miss this movie!!! it stays so true to the characters, the movie comes absolutely alive! in this film!!! it is a treasure & once you watch it, you will HAVE to own it!!  and then once you own it, you will watch it over & over & never get tired of it.  i have the 6 vhs tape version of this film, & my favorites are 4, 5 & 6, where the story starts to climax.  Pride & Prejudice is one of the best books ever written & this film does it justice.  It is the best adaption of this book i have seen.
B000063S6Z|3.0|Wow, looks like Moby was not to interested in pressing the envelop on this one. This album sounds almost identical to &quot;Play&quot;, I guess he knew that that sound sells and goes over well in corpoarte advertisements, so why change the formula. I expected alot more from Moby
014028009X|5.0|i received this book from a friend who had read it (& i had the great pleasure read while i was traveling in England) & i wholeheartedly recommend it to any girl who is single or who has ever been single - that's all of us, ladies!!!  those who loved pride & prejudice will especially love this story.  it's loosely based on that story (tho maybe not that loosely, the guy's name is Mark Darcy after all...)  Bridget Jones is hysterical, her take one things will have you laughing out loud.  Also, the crazy things she gets herself into will have you laughing out loud!  A definite must-read.  Definitely read the american version, unless you know how to translate english weight system to our pounds....
0679720200|3.0|This book is very strange, since it tells  a series of terrible events that change the life of a man forever.  However, it is not the events that make the book, but the reactions and thoughts the different characters have.<br />The main character, Mersault is simply intriguing... you learn about his life, his thoughts, his feelings... and yet, you know nothing at all... in my opinion, he is one of those characters that grows on you and in some instances you can even feel  identified with him, but in the end he is a Stranger whom you dont understand. <br />The plot itself is not very interesting, and it is a bit depressing, starting with a funeral and then moving on to a murder and finally a trail and  life in jail... still  it keeps you reading... I know,  it is hard to explain, and I guess that is exactly what has made this book a classic, it is impossible to categorize, analyze or even try to make sense of it.... but it is also impossible to put it down.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Whatever happened to Britney? <br />I don't really like Britney herself, but her songs on her first two albums were cool. I would listen and sing along and all. But now she's trying to turn her music into something totally different. I think the idea was great, but she didn't do it right. She complains too much in this CD...to me it seems as if she feels sorry for herself. <br />Her songs are not her style. Maybe if Alanis or Avril or someone like that had sung this, it would have turned out good. But I just hate it when Pop singers try to turn like this. it never works out...
B000063UR2|1.0|This movie is really really really bad!!!  First the beginning of the movie where we see the torture area is just plain gross.  The story line was a complete joke.  I couldn't even enjoy it.  I can't figure out why anyone could possibly like this movie.  Trust me this movie will scare your children, and make them cry, when the bad guys kill the unicorn.  Besides I thought in Fairy Tales that you can't kill a unicorn.  Anyone it's a joke, don't watch it, unless you really want to. Though I can't understand why you would!<br />P.S. I didn't want to give it any stars but it wouldn't let me.
B000066NW0|5.0|Wow! This CD is awesome. It's one you can listen to over and over again and not have to skip any boring ones. This cd's got lyrics that are fun to sing and I just LOVE the way she says pose.<br />Avril Lavigne is definatly NOT just another pop singer with rhyming lyrics. She's the queen of all punk singers and her CD rocks!!
0451204530|4.0|This is a very enjoyable book, well worth reading. Great suspense, very hard to put down. And great characters. <br />Some reviewers have a tendency to &quot;grade down&quot; all of Follett's books because they compare them to his Eye of the Needle and don't find them as good. That's silly. Eye of the Needle is a classic, and no writer can be expected to write the perfect book every time. I typically favor &quot;higher-brow&quot; literature, yet I really enjoyed Code to Zero. It fully deserves 4 stars.
B0000000LI|5.0|I've known about Yanni since a long time but I never really listened to any of his CDs till I found this one. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I've seen his music be the butt of so many jokes on TV and on the internet but I think all of that is unfair.<br />This CD is very evocative. I am going to get his Tribute album to see if it is as good.
0316666343|5.0|Have your hankies ready with this one.  It wasn't until near the end that I started crying and it hasn't been many books I can recall that made me cry.<br />The writing is great, the subject matter is difficult to deal with yet it is dealt with in a way that is heart wrenching.  It deals with the death of Suzie Salmon at 14 years old.  A violent death that leaves her family and friends shattered.  Suzie looks on from \\"her heaven\\" to watch them all keep living on earth and how her death changes the events that can happen to the living.<br />She also looks down and follows her killer, a serial killer and very evil soul.  To tell too much would to spoil this book for others.<br />I suggest it but be prepared to be sad and cry although there is a healing power in it, I promise.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Pop music is in a pretty bad state if this is what is being hyped. She's not bad, not untalented and possibly has a lot of potential, but you may find she's no big deal.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Whether your into action or being scared out of your pants, this film is for you! Being a big fan of the game, I thought the movie looked spectacular in the television commercials, and decided I'd check it out. It was everything I expected and more. It's considered a horror film because it's full of gore-covered cannibal zombies trying to eat the living, but at the same time, fans of films like \\"The Matrix\\" can enjoy it for it's action, fighting sequences, and sci-fi elements. <BR>Milla Jovovich puts on an incredible performance, bringing class and sophistication to the film in a way Angelina Jolie could have only dreamed of bringing to the far inferior Tomb Raider. It was, in fact, \\"Resident Evil\\" that first introduced me to Milla and made me a huge fan.<BR>Addicts of the game won't be disappointed either, as the film's plot works perfectly as a prequel to the first chapter of the game.
031286504X|5.0|If you think that this is just an adventure story with vampires, then you are missing the point. Sure, it works on that level, but intentionally or unintentionally, something much more sinister is going on.<br /><br /> This book was written in 1954, a time when there was general paranoia about communists hiding under every rock. More importantly, there was also a growing fear of the youth subculture and \\"juvenile delinquents.\\" When the vampires in this story are described as \\"pallid, glassy-eyed travesties of humanity\\" the author is obviously talking about drugged-up kids- either then or now.<br /><br />  Combine this with the fact that the hero (the last true man on earth) is described as being middle aged, of English-German stock, college educated, and cultured. In short, he is an upper-class wasp surrounded by a society of vampires (i.e. blood sucking freaks who contribute nothing to society.)<br /><br />  Having said this, as detestable as it is, I now have to say that this is exactly why people still identify with the main character. If you are an intelligent, cultured individual that has ever been forced to live in a state college dorm or a low end apartment complex, then you can also readily understand Robert Neville's siege mentality....<br /><br /> Oh yes, this book was the basis of the film \\"The Omega Man\\", but a much better version was made in Italy in 1964 called \\"The Last Man on Earth\\"- it stared Vincent Price in one of his greatest roles.
B00005LPVF|4.0|I recently got this CD in the mail from Amazon, so be aware I am reviewing this CD on first impressions. This is a good Metal record from one of the original NWOBHM bands(New Wave of British Heavy Metal)of the eighties.I really like this CD and I have been listeining to it over and over all day at work.(I do data entry) I have to say that I heard about this group from of course, Metallica. Metallica's versions of three of the songs  are vastly improved and superior to the originals on here.(The Prince, Am I Evil & Helpless)I think the problem lies with the production and sound. Am I Evil by Metallic sounds about a million times better this this version. This sounds okay but kind of demoish. I understand it was originally put out on an independent label.This CD also includes 8 Bonus tracks including the \\"Diamond Lights\\" EP.If you like Iron Maiden's first two CDS you will like this. That is what it reminds me of. A good innovative band that should write some more songs for Metallica, because although this CD is quite good I would not call it great. This band seems to have a bit of an identity crisis.Some of the bonus tracks sound early Def Leppardish. I heard they later disbanded and formed a glam pop Metal type group. They have a few songs like that on here. Overall I like this CD and will consider buying some of their CDS in the future. Just be warned if you are expecting early Metallica style music it is not quite that good.(But close!) Just a good precursor and influence. Is it worth the import price? I would say yes because there is no really good hard rock music being made nowadays so you have to buy good music where you can find it. Ugly CD cover. Singer is not the greatest in the world. Who knows with a big time record contract and producer this band could have been great. They are certainly as good if not better than Megadeth, a band alongside Metallica who are quoted in the CD booklet of being strongly influenced by this band. Also has lyrics to all songs and brief history. Anyway Metal Rules!! ...
B00005A46T|2.0|I certainly enjoyed the first Slipknot CD, which I found interesting for it's experimentation. Iowa, however is nothing but a collage of unfocused anger. The only redeeming feature here is the drummer, who is almost as good as the one in Cryptopsy. People=S*** is an honest effort, but the other tracks seem to be variation and embelishments of the same sordid formula. I can't seriously figure out the roll of all the members, when all you can think about is the drummer and Corey.<BR>The lyrics are presented as if they were dramatic ballads of angst, but they come out as being hollow, pathetic poetry.<BR>There are many Slipknot fans in my area who I feel are a little carried away. However awful, Slipknot can act as a gateway to connect the pointless Nu-metal scene to the agression of death metal and the beauty of black metal. If one truly enjoys this album they ought to check out acts such as In Flames, Emperor (my fav. band), Burzum, Carcass, At The Gates, Winds, Morbid Angel and anything from Norway. If you want to lean more towards unmelodic, pure chaos, you should look into Cannibal Corpse (before 1996)Cryptopsy (great drummer!) and the ambient-death band Beherit.
B00005MP58|5.0|Ok, so he's a bit of a snob, who cares? I just love watching Colin Firth in this version of one of the best stories ever. He's yummy! I am a big fan of Jane Austin and have read every one of her books....this story is my favorite. If you don't like to read, this movie version is almost as good.
B000005DSN|5.0|This cd is perfect, every song is great,but songs like black diamomd,the kiss of judas, the abyss of your eyes make this album a real master piece...<BR> The volcals are perfect,Timo Kotipelto voice is beautiful,the guitars are also perfect with a great sound,keyboards are good as the other instruments...<BR> This cd is not wastage of money...
B000063S6Z|4.0|I know that I am with many of my fellow Moby fans when I say that '18' is not as good as 'Play' but does that make it a bad album?  <br />This CD has been in my player continuously since i purchased it.  Sure, most of this CD isn't at the same level of many tracks from Moby's previous album (Porcelian, Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad, Everloving, My Weakness, and even South Side), but that doesn't make this CD &quot;bad&quot; at all.  It moves at a much different pace, and every track is an enjoyment, especially the first 3 or 4 tracks.  Taken alone, '18' is a great album, I would strongly suggest it, especially if you loved 'Play.'
0060920386|5.0|I never thought a book about LBO's would keep me on the edge of my seat.  Fantastic storytelling is at work here in this account of one of the most spectacular financial deals in recent memory and the epitome of the rapacious greed of the 80's.  The book has just the right combination of character development, excitement, investigative journalism and humor to make this a most memorable read.  While some of the conversations and events are obviously constructed, the authors go through considerable lengths to make the book historically accurate; this does not in any way detract from its dramatic appeal.  This would have made a great novel; that it actually happened makes it even better.  This book deserves a much broader audience than just Wall St.
B00004Z459|5.0|this is like my fav cd in the world its the best on the planet, try it it ROCKS!
0446677450|1.0|Save your money. If the author really cared about the financial responsibility of readers he would reccomend for them to save their money and not buy his book.
0871137380|5.0|I've been reading for some years now and this is the first book that I have truly fell in love with. The way Mark Bowden tells this story is amazing. you feel like you know each character like you've met him before. He describes the horrors and dreaded things that happened to America on the day they just went in to capture Aidid the warlord, in such detail that it made me sick to my stomach to think about it. The way he told more then one story during the book helps you to understand more about the Somalias and the Americans. He does a marvelous job of explaining about the D-Boys and the Rangers and it was just an all around good book. The movie was good, but to truly get the full picture and understand it better you HAVE to read the book. You will have no regrets.
B000065U1N|4.0|If youve read any of my other reviews here... you know i start out with ive seen alot of movies and yada yada.  i really enjoied this film though.  if you dont know its about a mission go astray (coming from the clinton administration go figure) in somalia in 1993.  the action in this movie is great and the sound is spectacular to say the least.  the fighting scenes and the gags are very well done.  the only critisism i have is that with all the characters in camo and many dying the plot to character part of the movie is lost and that some of the scenes probably shouldnt have been put in movies because of the gore.  dont get me wrong im a blood and guts down to bone with the rest of you but it isnt so much the gore but the graphicness of it when you see hundreds of somalians (skinnies as theyre referred to in the film) raid a down chopper and ravage a dead soldier and hold his body up high like hed kicked the winning field goal in the super bowl rather than killed several militia.  people that are get weak around blood or the inmature mind should keep away from this film but for the rest enjoi it.  4 stars.
B00004U8JV|4.0|JP: The Lost World is a strong sequel - as far as sequels go. Most No 2 movies fail or leave less excited than the first but this one really holds it's own.<br />Leading the cast again is Jeff Goldblum who as an actor can speak the most technical dialogue as flawlessly as a bird singing. And, he does it with humor. He is a great actor to watch speak. Juliana Moore is an excited character in her own right and often is the perfect foil to Jeff nervous character.<br />The young girl playing Jeff's daughter is just as funny - although I can tell not as experienced. Everyone else seems to pale against the story of the real stars of this film. The Dinosaurs.<br />Technically the film is great. The attack of the T-Rex on the edge of the cliff sequence is brilliant. Spielberg does try and do one important thing and this to make his characters real and more importantly sympathetic to their environment. They are not just props spewing out lines. They interact with each other, the dinosaurs and the sets. They are not part of the background.<br />The DVD extras on this one are good as well. Originally it came with a web link to JP III, but that film flopped big time. Now that was a waste of film even though Sam Neil tried to make an effort of it but the film lacked a lot.<br />This is a good DVD for your collection. (But the first JP film is still the best!)
B00005JKNF|3.0|Not the best movie in the world but far from the worst. Being a fan of old Agatha Christie mysteries, this movie provided me a nice change from the celluloid drivel currently seeping out of Hollywood. While the mystery itself isn't the most difficult to solve (I won't reveal the solution here so as not to ruin the 'surprise') the film nonetheless is enjoyable. <br />The biggest disappointment of the movie is Altman's moralizing. It is an annoying undertone that several reviewers see as subtle. With all the subtlety of a ball peen hammer being forcibly applied to an exposed skull, Altman engages in a sociological examination of the downtrodden working class. He <BR>portrays all the 'upper class' characters as vain, lazy pretentious and uncaring. At the same time the servants are portrayed as selfless and loyal to a fault.  Obviously, the truth of pre WWII England was somewhere in the middle.<br />The best parts of the film are the magnificent performances by the British ensemble cast (Maggie Smith alone is worth the cost of the DVD though what Ryan Philippe is doing in the cast is beyond me - he delivers what must be the worst Scottish/Irish/whatever accent heard on the silver screen). The humor is understated and the characters are brought vividly to life. You don't, as one previous reviewer suggests, have to have voted for Al Gore (heaven knows I did not) to enjoy this. In fact, given the wide spread illiteracy of FLA democrats evidenced in the last election, I would venture to say the nuanced performances are lost on most Al Gore supporters.<br />All in all the movie is a fine diversion - but don't buy it for the mystery as there really is not that much of one. In this case, the acting is the thing.
B000002KIE|4.0|To look at this objectivly, the Sex Pistols DID bring punk up from the filthy streets into the public eye.  But what did they do when they got there? The Sex Pistols themselves could've and should've been more. But the album is grand, with Rotten's vocals harsh and raspy, lyrics above the bar set by people influenced by them, and a good enough concept of the guitar and its uses. All in all, if you wish to be considered a \\"punk\\" nowadays, you MUST sing the praises of this album. For that reason I recommend not owning it. But I digress, it is an above average record. I suggest you invest.
0316666343|4.0|For anyone who has lost a loved one, Lovely Bones gives hope, closure and healing.  The aching question of &quot;where are you?&quot; is dealt with compassionately but without heavy religious overtones.  You won't find harp plucking angels or a benevolent Father sitting on a throne.  Instead a lively fourteen year old who violently leaves the earth, is most interested in keeping tabs on her family and friends.  They continue to grow, she stays fourteen.  They face painful obstacles she is powerless to change, and yet...  It is a very worthwhile read.  I only wish I hadn't finished it so quickly.  This is a book to savor and Sebold's prose is lyrical.  One wants to reread and write lines down for future use.
B00000IPAX|2.0|Nothing more. No notable lyrics, no political stance, just more of the same &quot;boys just wanna have fun&quot; pap MTV has been churning out for years. I'm more disapointed in myself for shelling out 5 dollars for a used copy of this CD from one of my friends. Pity.
0553208845|2.0|I choked down Siddhartha in a matter of a few hours.  This, however, should be interpreted as impatience to be done with the thing and get on to something more worthwhile.  It was, in a word, tedious.  It isn't that the philosophy is bad; it's just that anyone with even a rudimentary foundation in Eastern thought will have heard it all before (and much more eloqently, I might add) in various sutras and the like.  Hesse isn't exactly breaking new ground here.<br />Still, it could be a worthwhile read nonetheless, if was more concerned with being a novel rather than a platform for the author's enthusiasm about the philosophy/religion in question.  But it's not.  There is essentially no action outside of the title character's predicatable spiritual journey, and none of the characters have any existence beyond the most basic: Gotama, Govinda, and the ferryman are 'wise.'  Kamala and the merchant are 'worldly.'  Siddhartha is 'wise,' 'worldly,' and then 'wise' again.  And that, folks, is all she wrote.  Quite literally.  I challenge anyone to provide me with a character portrait of ANY of these people that goes beyond single-adjective territory.<br />'That's not the point,' you might say.  'It's not about the characters particularly; it's about a spiritual awakening.'  Oh, but it's exactly the point.  Because Siddhartha is NOT a sutra; it is a novel (though one imagines that Hesse might have wished otherwise), and a novel with no compelling characters, meaningful action OR unique ideas is not a novel that I want to read.<br />I suppose I might recommend the book anyway; given how quick a read it is, and how so many consider it a classic, it wouldn't hurt to have it under your belt.  But I must strongly contest the notion that, reputation aside, it is a great, or even a particularly good, piece of writing.

B00005NWM3|1.0|I couldn't believe this album.  I put in the CD in the player and pushed play. Song 1...alright, not bad.  Song 2...wait isnt that Song 1.  Ok, Song 3...what the...same as 1 and 2.  Ok...I went through every track and besides the overplayed but good song &quot;How you remind me&quot; every song is the same.  I swear a couple of them use the exact same guitar riff just slightly different distortion.  Anyways, I was extremely disappointed in this album because all the songs are the same with different depressing lyrics that not many can relate to. Not worth the money...just download their hit.
B00005Q66T|5.0|First of all, I would like to make a correction on behalf of Rebecca's comments on this album. The songs \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" are not from the BEDTIME STORIES album, but originally from the EROTICA album released in 1992. The first studio album of which Madonna has released in 1992 after her 1990 IMMACULATE COLLECTION following her 1991 film Truth or Dare. As far as this CD collection, though \\"American Pie\\" is not included (nor any new material), I'm sure Madonna is saving that song remake for the next collection in the next 10 years from now. The only thing that I was expecting was that she should've included 2 more songs from the EROTICA album, which is \\"Fever\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\". But all in all, hats off to Madonna!!!

B00004XONN|5.0|I picked up &quot;Kid A&quot; several months ago, but I never really listened to it, just heard it. Just played it while at my desk while at work.  <BR>  This past Memorial Day, I took this CD up north to Glidden, in beautiful northern Wisconsin. Everyone else had went to bed,<BR> but I wasn't tired yet.   I decided to pop in &quot;Kid A&quot;, seriously listen to it, and watch the fire. Life has not been the same since.  <BR>  &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; are two of the most challenging, difficult interesting and sastifying albums that I have heard.<BR> It's not rock'n'roll, but I like it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This was an awesome movie. Brad Pitt really fit the part of Tyler Durden and Edward Norton was great. Filled with dark humor, crucial points and one of a kind directing from David Fincher whose made another classic movie, Seven, as well. You can do no wrong with this.
B00004W52U|5.0|This is a really good CD, and I listen to it a lot.  If you like Rancid, or any punk you should get this.  It is not one of the best CDs I own, but it is very good.  Definitely worth the money.
0425152251|5.0|This book just blew me away; even though it took a little bit of time adjusting to the tone and theme, the underlying philosophical questions, history, and credible information about western (and some eastern) civilizations provided for a highly entertaining and engaging read. The principles covered cannot even begin to compare to an introductory philosophy class.  The way that the information is presented is a surefire way to commit the three thousand years of progress to memory! The plot slowly unfolds throughout the story, with some humor and interesting perspectives. This is NOT only a high-school only novel; actually, I had no idea high schoolers were reading this. I would highly recommend it to college-level and above, and anyone interested in history/philosophy in general. You MUST read this book. It is an excellent source for a worldview perspective, with a very informative history lesson.
B000000YG5|4.0|I had to listen to this one several times before I truly appreciated it -- and it was well worth it. &quot;Strode Rode&quot; and &quot;Moritat&quot; are classics; &quot;Blue 7&quot; hits home also.<BR>Still, you might also want to consider Cannonball Adderley &quot;Somethin' Else,&quot; and for contrast some John Coltrane (Kens Burns has a good selection of Coltrane).
B000065U1N|4.0|When I first read the book I was baffled at the fact that these elite troops were almost brought to their knees by the lack of communication, bad luck and frustration. I was hoping there would be a film and to my pleasure there was. One thing one must remember is that the troops involved in this battle were following orders and in my mind oustanding soldiers<br />The action scenes are well done and the amount of shooting and chaos is really quite gripping. The number of well known actors is also a comforting sight for the eyes. The resume however can be written in a few lines: The crack troops from the US Army go in to secure and capture a well known warlord, everything goes to plan until a helicopter gets shot down. After a long battle the troops emerge victorious despite the sheer overwhelming number of militia.<br />Not much of a scenario but let's face it, that is what really happened. The end of the film is quite abrupt and I would have liked to have known why the plan crumbled to that extent and the lessons drawn from such an operation but I suppose that is \\"Classified\\". The music and the setting is well matched to Somalia. I enjoyed the film but being someone who likes most war films and a fair amount of action, it would seem normal. I would at least recommend watching this film and for any hardcore fans then a buy is a must!
B00005RIKD|5.0|And very nice.<BR>Hey, it's Sting, ya can't go wrong.

0312265859|1.0|this book [is bad].  it is supposed to be a romantic supense novel.  where is the romance in having sex with someone other than the love interest?  i was totally disappointed in stephanie's behavior with ranger.  i always thought ms. evanovich was an excellent romance writer, but she has totally missed the mark in this book.  the mystery portion was okay.  the laughs were okay.  as a book about a woman who sleeps around it is okay.  as a romantic supense novel 2 thumbs down.
B00003Q43A|4.0|ID4 set multiplexes on fire when it was released on July, 1996, mainly due to its irresistible trailer and word-of-mouth hype.  And while the majority of viewers dismissed it as a cliched alien-invasion film, I still stand as one of its defenders.  For sure, it doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Close Encounters...,&quot; but it's still a watchable, above-average flick despite its hokey touches.  The plot is simple: aliens come to earth and destroy major cities around the US (If you haven't seen the picture of the White House blown to bits, you clearly don't get out much).  The president (a Clinton-esque Bill Bullman) calls upon military services to fight these creatures.  That's when a bigshot Marine (Will Smith) comes in to save the day.  That's the plot in a nutshell.  The special effects are good but not great, and the suspense leading to the attack keeps the viewer glued to the story.  Trust me, I have seen far worse &quot;event&quot; summer movies that are doubly unoriginal and rely on cliches that are just as tired.  Yet, ID4 overall succeeds because it doesn't take itself all that seriously.  If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment, this will do.  It's far more interesting than anything Jerry Bruckheimer will ever produce.
B000065V1V|5.0|It is very much to David Bowie's credit that on his first venture for Columbia, he delivers a challenging and touching collection of songs, in a style that avoids the assaltive density of &quot;Earthling&quot; but in no way compromises his vision to the commercialism of his post Eno albums, &quot;Lets Dance&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot;. Instead &quot;Heathen&quot; offers a dark vision of the post 911 world with a cohesive musical sound that is built on the foundation of some of his finest work.  <br />Waves of synthesizer washes remiscent of his triogy of albums with Brian Eno dominate the sonic palette of the album.  At times we hear flourishes of horn arrangements from some of his most blatently commercial efforts.  Through it all, however, this is ensemble playing, with no one musician featured.  <br />And hey, let's hear it for the contributions to this album of guitarist David Torn, a long standing ECM cult figure with a small but dedicated following of fans.  Torn gives the the required Frippery feel to the guitar lines without ever giving in to the grandstanding other guitarists have delivered on Bowie's recordings.  Frankly, I'm tired of Reeves Gabrel's overkill guitar attack that have laced most of David Bowie's albums since Tin Machine.<br />The great power of this record is not so much in the musicality, but rather in the finest songwriting craftsmanship David Bowie has delivered since the early eighties.  All the songs on Heathen, even in its seemingly lighter moments, are about extreme personal loss and alienation.  Bowie's best writing is characterized by his uniquely idiosyncratic allegorical images that present, even on hits like &quot;Lets Dance&quot;, a deeply nihilistic vision of the world that lies not all too far beneath an infectious pop melody.  <br />The dark vision that ties these songs together are the references to the 911 World Trade Center disaster that permeate the album.  From Sunday's declaration that &quot;everything has changed&quot;, to the images of slipping away over &quot;Coney Island&quot;, being caught in a &quot;Slow Burn&quot;, to the &quot;demand for a better future&quot;, Heathen is an album that could not have been written prior to last September.  Even the packaging, with its images of defaced figures of Catholicism and Bowie dressed in business attire descending a brightly lit staircase surronded by solid brick walls, all allude to the reprecussions of the 911 disaster.  Who are the &quot;Heathen&quot; Bowie is referring to anyway?<br />Sometimes great tragedy can inspire great statements from our poets, writers, artists and musicians.  Beneath Heathen's deceptive pop melodies, is a profoundly sad, poignient and ultimately touching album, the depth of which pop music often aspires to, but only occaisonally achieves.  I think time will prove &quot;Heathen&quot; to be one of the finest efforts in David Bowie's recorded legagy.
B00002MZ12|5.0|Alanis performs so well live that it doesn't even seem to be recorded live. Her songs are so pure in this album that if the audience wasn't in the backround you would never be able to tell that this performance wasn't recorded in a studio. A lot of her songs that she plays in this CD she makes them sound better then the origional on the studio CD. The band never messes up and sounds just as good as ever, and Alanis is comfortable. She plays the flute and harmonica and sounds great too. So if you like live CDs or if you dont like them, I still would recommend this CD to you because it suits everyone.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The plot is simple on the surface: Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man out on a romantic and quixotic search for vengeance against the men who murdered his wife and damaged his brain that prevents him from forming new memories.  Director Chris Nolan presents the plot of \\"Memento\\" backwards in 10-minute increments to highlight Lenny's fragile memory and confusion.    Thus, as the Amazon.com reviewer noted, what happened is not nearly as important or interesting as why things happened.<br />The acting is superb on all counts, as each actor plays their role perfectly.  The only gripe I have is that the plot has some serious holes (\\"How does Lenny remember he doesn't remember?\\"), but if the viewer is willing to relax his or her sense of reality, the plot is deeply engrossing.  I highly recommend this film.

0345440757|5.0|I started reading this book when my baby was 2 weeks old, although I had the book for many months before.  Even though I raised my first child wholeheartedly AP, I was open for Tracy's technique.  I tried it with my new \\"textbook\\" baby and I knew I loved it. She helps you figure out what type of baby you have:  Angel, Textbook, Sprited, or Grumpy. Then you learn the traits of that type of baby; its cries and motions.  It makes it so easy to distinguish YOUR baby's cries and needs.  I know immediately when my baby is hungry, wanting a hug, or overtired.  The schedule really helps my husband too.  He knows when it is time for our son to eat, play and sleep!  <BR>   NEED SLEEP?  I breastfeed my son and at 4 weeks he was sleeping 6-7 hours at night!  I never had that with my daughter and didn't know it was even possible with breastfed children.  But the schedule makes that happen.  I had only read AP books when I had her, so I did whatever I could to comfort her and fed on demand. I truly did NOT believe in schedules.  By Tracy's definition my daughter was a \\"spirted\\" baby.  I wonder how she would have done on this program.  It may have made my life much easier!!  (She is 3 now)<BR>   COMFORTING THE BABY:  As I believe there is nothing wrong with doing everything, it doesn't give you any time for yourself.  This way affords you that YOU time.  Tracy does not condone crying it out nor does she AP.  This is middle of the ground sort of speak.  She never says that you shouldn't pick up your child and hold them if that is what they need!  But as soon as the needs are met you put them back down so they build their own independence.  For me it has worked beautifully!  My baby is very happy and rarely cries because I know exactly what he needs!<BR>   GOING BACK TO WORK?  My daughter had a hard time starting at day care when I went back to work..due to the schedule.  I believe my son will have a much easier time because he is on EASY (Eat, Activity, Sleep, YOU).  I think the day care teachers will also!  I have adapted his EASY schedule to fit perfectly with his new daycare.  So it should be a pretty good transition. I love the EASY program because it is exactly what you do as an adult. You don't go to sleep after eating dinner so why should your baby?  I always put my daughter to bed already asleep (bad thing) and she almost always fell asleep on the breast.  It took her a LONG time to learn how to fall asleep on her own because I did this in her infancy.  Having activity time after my son eats not only provides such a wonderful time with him (happy and alert..tummy full) but also keys me in to when he really is tired (the yawns, the 7 mile stare).  I cannot say enough.  What a lifesaver (and marriage saver at times) this has been!<br />Ladies, if you are new to parenting, get this book!  If you want to figure out what your baby is saying with those cries, get this book!  And if you want some time for yourself and want your baby to be content, get this book!
B00005QDW1|2.0|I never liked No Doubt's old stuff a lot even though I thought it was good. Then when I heard Hey Baby I thought this cd was terrible. After hearing the second single (Hella Good)I really liked that so I went ahead and bought the cd. After hearing  clips I liked them too. What a mistake it is probably one of my least favorite cds and it is a really short cd wtih lots of filler.<br />Intro-The weirdest intro I have ever heard-pretty stupid<br />Hella Good-This the second best song on the cd. Cool beat! but they only sing like a sentence and then they mixed it a lot-9/10<br />Hey Baby-Overplayed and annoying-4/10<br />Making Out-This is probably the best song and the reason for 2 stars. It has a cool chorus really catchy and a good idea for a next single-10/10<br />Underneath It All-This is a pretty stupid song with a Jamican beat-2/10<br />Detective-This is an ok song but not good at all-4/10<br />Don't Let Me Down-One of many just plain bad uncatchy songs-2/10<br />Start The FIre-THis is an ok song but still nothing special-1/10<br />Runinng-The stupidest song they sung about 4 words and mixed it to be 4 minutes long-0/10<br />In My Head-Boring-1/10<br />Platinum Blonde Life-Sorta boring-1/10<br />Waiting Room-Just am not feeling it!!-1/10<br />Rock Steady-They took clips from the intro and added some more junk to make it even worse.<br />Although I don't like that either PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD STUFF because it at least showed they had some talent. Or Gwen could do an album with Eve because the song Let Me Blow Ya Mind is the best!!!
B00000DQSZ|5.0|I know of a lot of excellent albums from the 60's through the early 80's, but I don't hesitate to say that this is ONE OF THE VERY BESTS. Its achievement is only comparable with those of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; (King Crimson), &quot;Tarkus&quot; (Emerson, Lake and Palmer), &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; (Led Zeppelin), &quot;Music from Penguin Cafe&quot; (Penguin Cafe Orchestra), &quot;Technopolis&quot; (Yellow Magic Orchestra),<BR> &quot;Flowers of Romance&quot; (Public Image Limited).<br />Although the kind of music that Kraftwerk among others created was originally called &quot;techno&quot;, yet the meaning of it has changed drastically, and I guess the better term today would be &quot;electro-pop&quot; or something like that.<br />Anyway, you can't expect any of such groups for strong beats that you can notice in modern techno bands like Underworld. I believe that when Kraftwerk made their albums, there wasn't a hint of the style that we now identify as &quot;dance&quot; from which Underworld is greatly influenced.<br />What Kraftwerk achieved in this album can be said to be musically monumental and I believe the history of music wouldn't have so many productions as good as this. The creativity in this was really a hallmark.

0446608955|5.0|-A Masterpiece-<BR>A nights read, a Walk to Remember is a well written book.  Throughout the entire book your attention never dwindled.  Unpredictable until the final pages.  The book had all the ingredients for a perfect book: romance, saddness(it really was touching and you felt like it was happening to you), happiness(that was strong and really even raised your spirit), and in some parts there were parts that made you laugh.  It was a book fit for people who feel down or just want a basic novel, without violence.  A perfect book that shows that love can really be found at such a young age(17).  And first perspectives arn't always right.
B000065U1N|5.0|Being a former paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne, I took more than a casual interest in this film. Having said that, I'd never seen combat. Neither did most of Task Force Ranger, until October 3rd, 1993. As far as I'm concerned, this was an amazing film in its effort to portray the ruthless and brutal nature of men in combat. It ain't pretty in the movie and I'm sure it wasn't pretty for the 3/75 Rangers and Delta Force operators who fought in it.<br />I think the palpable fear, the scared ...emotions of kill or be killed, came through so well in the movie. Many people have said this movie was very depressing. In a lot of ways, they were right. 19 KIA, 72 WIA from a force of barely more than 100 soldiers. But, what I also take from this movie is the guts and pride of the Delta operators, two of whom were awarded the Medal Of Honor posthumously, for saving a Black Hawk pilot from certain death after his bird was shot down by an RPG. Maybe some of the Rangers, though very well trained, we somewhat naive about wanting to see combat. Maybe they weren't. Either way, what I take from this is that I'm proud as hell to have worn the same jump wings on my chest as the soldiers from Task Force Ranger who fought in Somalia. They were thrown into a city of one million armed idiots stoned on \\"gancha\\". One hundred were pinned down and took an unimaginable volume of gun and rocket fire. The fact that any of them survived is a tribute to how well trained they are. I don't think the average person understands how good Delta Force operators are. These guys (along with the Navy SEALS) are the finest warriors in the world, bar none. And not far behind them are the Army Rangers. My hat goes off to all of them. Black Hawk Down showed the will of men to fight, survive, and rescue their brothers in arms. Somalia was a mistake politically because we had Clinton ...for President. But Black Hawk Down also proved something I've known since I served in the 82nd: The United States of America isthe greatest country on earth and we have the finest, most dedicated soldiers. The reason we do is because we have more to fight for than anyone else and everyone else knows it.<br />Thanks to all my fellow veterans and especially the ones who went into combat with knees shaking and heart's pounding....BUT STILL WENT... and made us all proud. I have more respect for an 18 year old Army Ranger than I do for ex-President Clinton. Clinton stands for nothing. At least the Ranger who goes off into combat is willing to stand up and fight. Bill Clinton had that chance during Vietnam, but he flat chickened out. I put these soldiers above all the CEO's, Politicians, etc. because without them, we have nothing.<br />Black Hawk Down showed that more than anything. Ho-ah!
B00005JKNF|5.0|It's such a pleasure to watch fine actors such as these in this movie. Maggie Smith stole the movie as usual.
B000007VCM|5.0|I wish I could find another album that blew me away like this one. Like many, I bought it for Rain and She Sells Sanctuary. It was during a time in the 80's when alternative went pop. I went through the late 70's early 80's listening to alternative and watched corporate music take over.<br />For one album, it changed everything! NO heavy production, NO mass marketing. It was like finding a ton of gold. From the first time the needle hit the album I was hooked. No cueing up the &quot;best&quot; songs on the album. The whole thing is great. I think it sounds better on vinyl just because of the raw sound that is this album.<br />As I said I just wish I could find another with the power this album has. (Stone Roses - Second Coming is pretty good but that was 8 years ago)
B00003CXXP|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie tops my list of time and money wasting movies. This was a movie that lacked that &quot;certain something&quot;. Haley Joel Osment did a pretty good job, but that was about it. The plot was thin, and after a while you have no sympathy for any of the family members. It was so bad that I just had to walk out. I think that the best part of the movie was the little mechanical teddy bear that the boy toted around wherever he went. All in all I think that Steven Speilberg was trying to make a modern day ET, but it horribly backfired into a plain, boring, and flat out bad mish-mosh of lines simply composed. I love Steven Speilberg but this movie just fell terribly short of my expectations. Think twice before buying it!

B00005QDW1|4.0|I guess it's no surprise that so many long-time fans of No Doubt really hate this record, because I've always hated No Doubt, but I LOVE this record!  First off, they couldn't have chosen better producers -- Sly &amp; Robbie have been tearing up dub and dancehall for god knows how long, and their expertise really shows through.  Also Prince?  The guy's a genius, so you know whatever He touches will glitter.  Can't argue with Ric Ocasek, either. Anyway, as for all the reviewers who state that No Doubt have completely departed from their ska roots: well that just ain't true, because dub and dancehall are straight outta Jamaica, same as ska -- in fact reggae was born when ska was slowed down, and then dub and dancehall followed a bit later.  Anyhoo, long story short: give it a listen.  It made me want to dance, so that has to be a good thing.

B000066NW0|5.0|This album is breath taking!  I relate with her thoughts and emotions to the thoughts in so many ways, I didn't think it was possible.  Her voice opens my ears and my soul to a whole new kind of genre of music.  Her songs are meaningful and they show me what kind of person I am connecting with through song.  Avril fan all the way for me!!!  This girl is talented and not to mention extrememly bright when it comes to the road of life.  She knows what she wants and shes out to get it!  Ladies & Gents... now introducing... AVRIL LAVIGNE!!!
0446677450|5.0|Had a quick look at Amazon.com, and usually don't write reviews, bit having a look at the comments made by \\"a reader\\" I must say I'm shocked, since I had the exact opposite view of the book.<br />I thought it was insightful, and it has already help me on the path to financial security (I built a business, that doesn't need me). The book teaches about how our thoughts affect the way we deal with money (like poor people who win the lottery and three years latter they are poor again - bad money habits). He also says a lot about the up coming changes that will affect us all (downsizing, baby boomers retiring, massive government debt, etc), as well as what the future could hold. Finally he talks about how education must teach young people about money and investing (Alan Greenspan talked about this to a congressional hearing a few months back, too)....
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne rocks!  I just got her CD and she is now my favorite female punk rock artist.  I love all the songs on her new album Let Go.  Its got angry tunes with much attitude and serene ballads which really shows her voice. What's so cool about it is that she wrote her songs at the age of seventeen!  The first time I listened to her album I was like, \\"This girl can sing!\\"  She has an amazing voice.  This is her first record and she already sounds like a professional.  She's coming out as a very strong young lady and I know she'll make it big!  I find her inspirational because not only she has a powerful voice, but she is one of a kind.  Her lyrics gave me a strong impression of who she is and that she's aware of that.  She's not afraid to show her real self and she's not going to let anybody change that like in, \\"Nobody's Fool\\".  She's also my age which is really cool.  Besides the fact that this is her first, I think she has accomplished much with this album.  It shows what a capable songwriter and singer she is and knows where she's coming from.  She's a girl who just likes to have fun and is going through the same things other teenage girls are going through; she tells it like it is in her songs.  I would definitely recommend Avril Lavigne. Let Go to everyone.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it an eleven with two thumbs up!!!
0385334206|5.0|This book is great in that although written 30 years ago,and Vonnegut was satirizing things from back then,it still holds up. At first,I found the narrative a bit pedantic but then it really started to work for me. \\"Hardly(anything) is sacred\\",Vonnegut writes in the foreward.,and while reading his pot-shots of all things (absurdly) American you realize he's right. One of the best satires that I've ever come across..
B00003CXB2|5.0|I'll keep this rather concise. The title of this film is important: Not just \\"Lawrence\\" (a title a less imaginative director and writer might've attached to such a project), but \\"Lawrence of ARABIA.\\" David Lean's saga tells the story of a man, disenchanted with the banality and rigid conformism of conventional society and the British military, who uses the desert as a stage upon which he creates and brings to life an entire enigmatic, legendary persona. His colorful behavior leads all of us to ask: What are Lawrence's true intentions in leading these wild Arabs? Is he a shameless, posturing opportunist? Does he genuinely care for the anti-Turkish cause? Is he seeking an escape from sterile \\"normal\\" life in an adventure with theatrical sheiks and surging waves of sabre-waving calvary? Is he a man abandoning his regulated station in favor of creating his own reality, his own life, as he chooses to shape it? <br />I think it's a swirling, delightful, exuberant mixture of all of them. <br />David Lean is a genius, as is less-is-more wordsmith Robert Bolt. And what about Peter O'Toole, you ask? No one besdies him could have generated such a wild-eyed, over the top drama. <br />And I won't even comment on that dazzling supporting cast of Omar Shariff, Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, and Jack Hawkins. And I will especially avoid going out of my way to describe the visuals of the film. Words can capture not its spirit and its vitality...this energy of a wash of robes against the backdrop of the arid immensity. <br />I don't hold any one film to be my absolute FAVORITE of all time, but I do cherish a selection of films as my favorites, and films I consider to be the best of all time. Lawrence of Arabia is among them, alongside 8 1/2, 400 Blows, Citizen Kane, the Godfather, the Seventh Seal, Casablanca, and some others. But Lawrence transcends most of the other in the sheer panoramic scope of its imagination. This movie could never be made by a majoy Hollywood studio today; directors lack the courage and the inventiveness.
0312265859|5.0|...when you finish the eigth book in a series, and are so upset that it's over you go back and re-read the first seven.  Janet Evanovich has given her faithful (perhaps rabid) readers yet another hilarious, endearing, and interesting Stephanie Plum tale.  When you make characters so alive, and so vibrant that readers wish they could know them in real life? Well, I think you've definitely done something special.  <br />Thank you Janet!
B00005RJ1U|4.0|This film was good at the beginning, but at the end it starts to fall. They decided to show us what the Creeper looked like and I started laughing, This is the best attempt for new horror films. It would have been great if it weren't for a few plot holes, and a dorky ending.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Wow.  I was not sure if I wanted to put money into a voice I had never heard before, but my money was well spent.  His voice and music melt my skin.  The lyrics (while, yes a little cheesy, and need growth) are soothing.  I've never felt this relaxed listening to an album.  He is amazing.  Your Body is a wonderland is the best song on the album, and I was taken by surprise of how much I enjoyed each note John Mayer has created with his beautiful sound.  I'd buy it again if I had the chance.  So you should too.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Gosford Park assembles a huge cast and under Altman's direction, that cast interacts very successfully.  We have a schism between the upstairs aristocracy and the downstairs servants, but then again the two are blending together as we see who interacts with whom and who is really dependent upon whom.  This is a great social comedy -- and it is also very entertaining.  The cast, too, brings together a collection of new stars, brand new faces, and the aging stars of yesteryear.  This is done remarkably well, and the storyline never gets bogged down in either too much detail or too much triviality.  The film is more of a character study and a social study -- a presentation of how it was and how people lived within the rules of what it was.  The actual murder and mystery are secondary, but in the end the solution to it is rather delightful in part because it is well-justified in the storyline and also well-covered up by the bumbling arrogance of the police inspector come to solve it.  The film seems to be meant only as an exposition of a lifestyle, and it rewards us beautifully.  I can well understand why this was nominated for an Oscar for best picture.  If you are interested in a film with great acting and great characterizations, with brilliant stories and with maturity, take the time to see this one.  It's fun and witty, but it is also memorable, which you can't say about many films out of Hollywood these days.  Good soundtrack too.  Oh, and for Jeremy Northam fans, he sings several songs in the film and does a great job -- all in all, a very good film.
B00005JKCF|3.0|I took my 12 year old son to see this movie because we thought being PG13 rated, that perhaps it would be ok.  I normally do not allow my kids to watch PG13.  They are restricted to PG.  Spiderman is a perfect example of why I must continue to insist on this guideline.  During the movie, I heard small children (like 3 or 4 year old kids)screaming when Spiderman gets beat up rather severely.  One child cried out through the silence of the theatre, \\"Mommie, don't let them hurt Spiderman!  They are hurting Spiderman!\\"  He was clearly distressed to see his \\"hero\\" being assaulted in a very violent way.  After the movie was over, my son said, \\"Mom, don't bring my brother (who is 5) to see this movie.  I understand now why you don't want us to watch PG13 movies.  I liked the movie, but I thought it was too violent, and I think my brother would have nightmares if he saw it.  I'm not even going to tell him I saw the movie, so he won't be upset that he didn't get to come too.\\"<br />I am so glad that I did not bring my 5-yr-old with us that day.  This is a movie geared toward adults, and as an adult, I found it very entertaining.  I loved the special effects.  I loved watching Spiderman soar through the skies and use his special powers.  I enjoyed the conflict between characters, although I found the \\"save the girl\\" routines a bit melodramatic and unoriginal.  <br />My bottom line is I would take my husband, but not my kids, to see this movie.  It's a shame Hollywood took an innocent cartoon comic book story and turned it into a blood and guts horror film.  It would have been fine as an R rated movie.  I think many parents are fooled by the innocence of the idea of this being a cartoon and take their kids to see it.  This is more like a Stephen King movie disguised as a cartoon.  Beware.
0553208845|2.0|This short novel reads like a long fable, with a style reminiscent of short story artist Jorge Luis Borges.  The protagonist, Siddhartha, favored son of a Brahmin, leaves his father's house to embark on a spiritual journey.  As a Samana (a self-chastising ascetic) he is attended by his devoted friend Govinda, until they part over the worthiness of the teachings of the renowned holy man Gotama.  Siddhartha falls for the allures of a courtesan named Kamala, and enters into a financial relationship with the merchant Kamaswami.  He takes up drinking and gambling and becomes a wealthy debauchee.  Eventually repulsed by his own moral corruption, he leaves this life behind and becomes the humble assistant to a poor ferryman.  Here he learns to listen to the river, and comes to understand the totality of existence, but only after loving and losing his orphaned son.<br />This book was never a personal favorite of this reviewer, couched as it is in the tropes of eastern religious philosophy, but it neatly encapsulates Hesse's basic doctrine; his other books (e.g. Steppenwolf and Demian) are more focused on the character of the seeker than on the details of the search, and as such are both more novelistic.  Being a fable, and set in an unfamiliar (to many westerners, at least) culture, this book shows a likable (we are told, but readers are welcome to their own opinions - he seems self-centered and shallow to this reviewer) young man, making decisions and taking action without giving us any real clue as to why. Perhaps Hesse meant to show that life is a series of random choices that can only be understood once we have attained wisdom, but that wisdom can only be achieved through spiritual growth, which is itself only the consequence of those same random choices.  Thus reduced, Hesse is telling us to just live life, and trust that it'll all make sense some day.  More useful, perhaps, is what we're told to avoid: complacency, self-deprivation, over-indulgence, all external religious instruction, any kind of obsession or self-absorption.  Obviously there's no magic formula that enables one to make this happen, or everyone would be a sage, but Hesse's books certainly point out a clear set of priorities, whether we buy into them or not.  In sum, Siddhartha is useful enough as fables go, but don't expect miracles from it, even though it's exclusively about ideas, and really isn't much of a novel.  Definitely for those new to spiritual self-examination.igious instruction, any kind of obsession or self-absorption.

6305622914|4.0|The Full Monty is a \\"right good laff\\" (to borrow the parlance of its protagonists). Although the dialect may occasionally bewilder viewers unused to north-England speech, the humour doesn't need any translation. Gaz is down on his luck and is possessed of an endless supply of far-fetched money-making schemes. Inspired with a visit by the renowned Chippendale male strip-show artists to his hometown of Sheffield, and impressed at the huge amounts of money they make by seemingly just taking off their clothes and prancing around a bit, Gaz decides this is his ticket to some fast cash.<br />Part of the reason this film is likeable is that humour and realism go hand in hand. From the depressing backdrop of an industrial town with high unemployment, Gaz manages to cobble together a troupe of six unlikely strippers, including a suicidal security worker, a man with a dodgy hip, and a well-endowed bathroom repairman. These guys aren't super-studs, they're just ordinary blokes who are willing to give it a shot, and maybe, just maybe, get rich. <br />The film begins with Gaz and his friend Dave becoming marooned on a partially submerged car in the middle of a canal (the unanticipated result of one Gaz's plans), and the originality of the comedy continues throughout. So fresh is the humour, that the occasional moments when it sinks to the level of slapstick and cliche, disrupt the natural feel of the movie. The funniest sequences involve the self-titled 'Hot Metal' strippers - who have trouble comprehending dance moves unless they're related to positioning on a soccer field - attempting to master the strip-tease bump and grind (accompanied by a fabulous soundtrack of retro tunes, including Donna Summer and Hot Chocolate).
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Being a filmmaker, I have found an immense respect for Richard Kelly and I really can't express it enough.  If I meet this guy in person, I'd have to thank him for changing my life.  Donnie Darko us undeniably one of the most underrated movies ever created.  It combines every genre and packs it into one movie.  (Rarely achieved successfully by a director with obvious influences from Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch and even Spielberg himself and yes, this director can be compared to greatness.)  The acting and cast was perfect (I can't put Jake Gyllenhaal's performance into words, I'm still baffled!!!).  The 80's musical score was perfect as well as every aspect of the film.  A Logical illogical ride into divine intervention, Donnie Darko is nothing short of amazing and is right up there with E.T. and Mullholland Drive.  For his first Directing gig, this director reminds me of a young Orson Welles.  His work is truly amazing!  P.S.  I must warn you that this movie suggests intellectual participation so the average moviegoer: BEWARE!
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go, the highly anticipated debut from Canada's Avril Lavigne (a.k.a. \\"The Next Big Thing\\") fares well in living up to its pre-release hype. Unless you've been living in a cave for the past two months, you're probably familiar with the first hit single, \\"Complicated\\". But if that's the extent of your exposure to Lavigne thus far... Kiddo, you ain't heard nothing yet. <br />You might think Lavigne, a seventeen-year-old singer/songwriter from small-town Ontario would be awestruck at having her debut album chart at number 8 in the Billboard top ten. Doubly so, at seeing it rocket upwards after two weeks on the street, its ascent fueled by rave reviews and a frenzied word-of-mouth groundswell of popular acclaim. You might think the young beauty would be overwhelmed by the attention. But you would be wrong. Unlike certain of her contemporaries, who are seemingly more concerned with selling their pop-image and selling Pepsi than with producing a first-rate CD, Lavigne's persona is planted firmly in reality, a fact which shines through in her music. <br />On the whole, Let Go is a diverse and rockin' compilation of 13 tracks (plus a bonus track). The lyrics are honest and compelling and the music is accessible and infectious. While most of the tracks rest comfortably in the mainstream categorizations of \\"top 40 pop\\" and \\"modern contemporary\\", Lavigne's extraordinary voice powers the album in exploring the boundaries of these broad classifications.<br />From the punk-rockish \\"Sk8er Boi\\" (Skater Boy in skate-speak) through to the soulful and poetic \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", Lavigne's vocal range never fails to amaze in capturing the spirit of the music and engaging the listener. It was a wise decision on Arista's part not to overproduce the album as Lavigne's voice is clearly the CD's biggest strength. Rest assured that you will never see her resorting to lip-syncing on Saturday Night Live.<br />Thematically, Let Go exudes a 'Be True to Yourself\\" attitude. Not necessarilyin an aggressive or combative context, as how the persona of fellow Arista artist Pink is often portrayed, but in an explorative sense, with Lavigne relaying her life experiences and aspirations in song. Sometimes the attitude is manifested in jubilant rebellion, at others, in melancholic reflection. Always, however, it is brought to the listener with the honest perspective of a normal teenaged girl. I am not saying that guys won't be HUGE fans of Lavigne's red-hot sexiness, cruising around with the heavy base of Sk8er Boi slamming on their car stereos, but young women will undoubtedly have a natural affinity for Lavigne, seeing her as a contemporary rather than as some sort of manufactured \\"American Idol\\".<br />Lavigne wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album, giving the listener some insight into her world. Tracks like \\"My World\\" and \\"Mobile\\" reflect on her life as small-town girl and hopeful music star respectively. Unlike Britney Spears or certain other reigning pop divas who get their hit songs delivered to them in the mail, Avril Lavigne delivers them straight from the heart. It is very refreshing and further endears the naturally charismatic Lavigne to her growing base of fans.<br />Paradoxically, it is both easy and difficult to compare Lavigne to other artists. Having such a strong voice and convincingly belting out hits in various genres - from alternative rock to poetic folk - the comparisons come fast and furious: Jewel, Sarah McLachlan and LeAnn Rimes at one extreme and Courtney Love, Shirley Manson and Alanis Morissette at the other. Lavigne once even graced the stage at age 14, performing new country alongside superstar Shania Twain!<br />As more and more singles and music videos are released for this album, I am certain Let Go and Lavigne will continue to grow in popularity. I can understand people not wanting to buy an album on the strength of one hit song - I have been burned by that many times. Happily, Let Go does not rest on such a shakyfoundation. Play it in your car, spin it at a party, listen to it in your apartment or play it in the background on your computer. It is a great CD that you can enjoy in nearly any situation. Arista has been doing a great job in aggressively promoting the album - many acoustic performances of the songs can be found streamed on the internet. So if you are still in doubt as to whether Let Go is for you, search out some of these gems and they'll likely put any reservations to rest.<BR> <BR>Finally, in regards to the CD itself, I am glad to see that the outstanding music is matched by the caliber of the physical product. The CD liner has full lyrics, lots of pictures showcasing Lavigne, as well as the music video of the first single, \\"Complicated\\". There are also 2 videos profiling Lavigne included as multi-media extras. Add that to a slate of great songs and Let Go makes a great addition to your CD collection or a great gift to a friend or family member. Buy it now with confidence and then eagerly await Avril's tour coming to a city near you!!...
078401213X|5.0|I give it five stars because I honestly enjoyed it.  I can't say the audio/video quality was tops, but that wasn't the point of the film.  The quality of the story was excellent, and that was the point of the film.  The situations in the film were not cleanly beautiful--it was set in a dingy area and followed a disturbing story line--therefore it logically follows that the audio/video quality should be less than pristine.  <br />In the words of the Pi website, &quot;A key to creating the world of  was the futuristic soundscape created by Composer Clint Mansell, Sound Designer Brian Emrich, and host of electronic music artists, assembled by Music Supervisor Sioux Zimmerman and Producer Eric Watson. From early on, the creative team set out to achieve an ultra-modern contrast to the stark Black &amp; White 16mm images that were going to be on the screen.&quot;  They have succeeded, as the score merges fully with the video and enriches the film immeasurably by adding to its hauntingly unsettling ambience.  <br />The plot centers around the downward &quot;spiral&quot; of protagonist Max Cohen as he searches for a mathematical basis for life, involving applications of the golden ratio, pi, and the chaos theory to real life, specifically the areas of the stock market and Kabbalah.  The story proved to be interesting and thought provoking even outside of the actual film.  At the end of Max's fascinating and devastatingly painful quest, the viewer is left with a mystery to be pondered.  <br />In giving this film 5 stars, I refer to the amazing story, superb visual effects, and the thoughts it made me wonder about afterwards.  Another moving success from director Darren Aronofsky.
B000062YAZ|5.0|First off, let me tell you that while Slayer is my favorite band, I don't love everything they make; Hell Awaits is only a decent album and Divine Intervention is a hookless album.  I am telling you this so you don't think that I am a fanatic who loves all things Slayer (though I almost do), but am a thrash/death metal fan.  Now that this is out of the way, let me begin.<br />This is the best album ever made.  That is the basic message of this review.  RIB has the best timing, sequencing, and song lengths, of any album ever; everything fits like pieces in a puzzle.  The songs are the perfect length, not too short or too long.  The songs are in the perfect order, flowing seamlessly to one another.  And the accuracy of each member of the band is astounding; Lombardos' beats are blazingly fast, but always perfect; the same goes for Kings' and Hannemans' riffing and solos.  The bass, while not very audible, is fast furious, and adds quite a bit to the heaviness of the songs.  And Arayas' singing is perfect, sharp as a razors' edge, and just as deadly.<br />Now, I want to say something to people saying things like &quot;Oh, these bands that came out after this album was made were faster and heavier.&quot;  This may be, but I bet that all the bands that are faster and heavier use this as their source material.  Plus, the album was released in 1986, before any of those bands.  And for its' time, it was as brutal as it got.<br />So, masterpiece, genius, art, are not good enough to describe that album.  Buy it and see what I mean.
0446608955|5.0|Well, i'm a 16 years old girl who isn't really into books. A few friends of mine kept talking about this book, saying it's the most amazing book they've ever read! Anyway, i thought i'd give it a try, and see what they're all on about. \\"A Walk To Remember\\" cannot be found here in Israel, so i bought it via amazon.com and i so do not regret!!! I dont think i ever will..<BR>This IS THE book everybody have to read, whether they adore books, dont mind books or even aren't into it at all, like i used to be.<BR>Such an unbelievable, funny, sad, touching, upsetting, wonderful story! Everything you want in a book - is Right there.<BR>This is what i think, just a great book, i simply very recommend it for anyone out there...any time, any age...<br />Hope i helped you.. and I'll end now, before i write an essay lol
0312265859|3.0|Nothing new in this book.  It's the same plot with the same characters (some of them just have difference names in this book).  I loved the Stephanie Plum series, but I was so disappointed in this book.  As some of the other reviewers have suggested, it's time to go up to the next level.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Do you know where Norah Jones was 12 months, or even 6 months ago? I don't either. Once or twice a year an album comes along, out of the blue, that just blows you away. It's what makes music such a great art. &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is one of those albums. Don't be scared by the &quot;jazzy&quot; label people throw on Norah Jones. This simply is a collection 14 songs, 45 min., of beautifully polished and intimate songs.<br />The best songs on the album are the opener &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, the Hank Williams cover &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot;, the title track (one of the Norah Jones-penned tracks), and &quot;Painter Song&quot; (one of several songs by bassist (and beau) Lee Alexander). If you like to be surprised, or if you simply like great music, whatever style, then by all means buy this! You won't regret it.
B00003CX95|5.0|Much of the details of the events depicted in the movie are grossly incorrect.  However, William Wallace was a true patriot (Scotland's George Washington) and rallied a war-torn and rival clan nations into a single nation, although Scotland eventually lost its independence to England.<br />The Blackwatch are still opposed to English rule.  The movie was very entertaining and Mel did a great job!
B00005N9CV|3.0|I enjoyed this CD, but I would like it better if some of the songs were not quite so slo[...] I get sleepy when listening to the CD.
B000065U1N|5.0|It is truly amazing that America has such fine men to defend our peoples and our way of life.  When you ask those troops why they do it, they will not answer you.  But they do it for each other and for the code.<br />The biggest tragedy is that Clinton was not impeached for serious constitutional violations.  Placing American military under foreign control is strickly forbidden by the US Constitution.  The actors acurately portrayed the fine soldiers, especially the two Delta teammates that dropped in to protect the second downed chopper, even though they believed the crew to be dead and knowing that they would NOT be returning home.  What fine soldiers, what fine men!<br />Semper Fi!
B0000640VN|5.0|With the string of mostly clean, viewer friendly movies I've been seeing lately! Movies I LOVE, without ANY scenes that I'm embarrassed to watch with my parents. Kate and Leopold is another old-fashioned, clean-cut new classic, joining the other new, family friendly films such as The Majestic, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars Episode 2, and Spider-Man!<br /> Kate and Leopold is the story of two lonely people from different times. Leopold (Hugh Jackman) is a young duke from the 19th century, who's family has moved to America and squandered away their fortune. As a result, Leopold is now being forced to choose a wife. The problem is, Leopold is not in love. Kate (Meg Ryan) on the other hand, is a New York City girl who has recently and bitterly broken up with her longtime boyfriend, Stuart, an inventor who has discovered a portal through time. Stuart leaps through his new discovery and unintentionally brings Leopold, his great, great, great (I forget how great exactly) grandfather, back with him to modern day New York City. From here we get a charming fish out of water love story reminiscent of Splash, but maybe a little less bizarre. Just a little. While Stuart is in the hospital recovering from an elevator accident, Leopold charms his way into various people's hearts, and becomes a bit of a role model for Kate's younger brother, Charlie. Eventually, Leopold even manages to charm his way into Kate's battered heart, and, being Meg Ryan, she manages to charm him right back. But while this odd romance is blossoming, Stuart is telling his time portal story to the hospital doctors and nurses, who take it all in with more than a grain of salt. He soon finds himself in a psychiatric ward, desperate to break out and find his way back to his ancestor and the time portal. He fears that if he doesn't send Leopold back to his own time soon, he, himself, will cease to exist!<br /> Kate and Leopold reminds us that a film can be funny, heartwarming, sweet and charming, without a lot of foul language, gratuitous footage, and innuendo. This is simply a charming love story, with endearing characters and a touch of fantasy. There's nothing more to say about it, except that you should pick up a copy today!oul language, gratuitous footage, and innuendo.

B00003CY0V|2.0|After the first hostage explodes peppering <BR>a city with ball bearings, the movie grinds <BR>to a halt.  While I enjoy watching<BR>John Travolta dance, another remake of the<BR>psychotic villian so aptly played in Broken<BR>Arrow starts to grate.  <BR>Most hackers I have met as a computer <BR>security engineer are nothing like the one<BR>portrayed by Hugh Jackman. <br />The other actors were not memorable to me at all.<br />This movie seems to have expensive special effects, <BR>but I got a sense watching it that the special <BR>effects were done first, then a script was thrown <BR>together to tie the special effects together.<br />The plot twists were nothing compared to the beautiful <BR>weirdness of movies like The Matrix.<br />...
0671027344|5.0|I think this was one of the best books I have ever read.  I fell in love with Charlie and how vunerable and honest he was as a character.  It is one of those books that breaks your heart and makes you cry with joy at the same time. I recommended it to two other people and before I knew it  it had been passed along to a whole group of my friends.  <BR>      It is  simply a \\"day in the life\\" story about a teenage boys' struggle to be accepted but still be true to his gut feelings.  The authour writes with such and strong and unique voice that you really miss the characters when you are finished.  In fact, when I was done with it, I went back to the first page and read it over again.  If there is ever a fire, my worn out copy is one of the things I will grab.
B000066NW0|5.0|Her CD, LET GO, is an awesome album!  What's great about it is that Avril writes her own lyrics, so it's so much easier to relate to her music.  Rather than someone else writting some \\"poppy\\" song that has no real topic.  <BR>The boys in the band (Even, Mark, and Matt) are the kewlest!!  They all have their different sytles and personality's which make the band incredable!! <BR>The CD has different kinds of music rather than one type of genre.  That's something else that's kicks about it.  She has simple yet \\"up to beat\\" songs, slow deep songs, \\"punk\\" songs . . . the list goes on.  If you're thinking about buying this CD, then from me to you . . . GO BUY IT!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|It really didn't surprise me that Shakira is such a big deal at the moment. She is talented and her voice is very unusual from those teenybopper pop artists we have nowadays like Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson or Mandy Moore. Her voice has a unique quality and is very hard to copy and that's what should count in show business. Of course, not only does Shakira have a beautiful voice, she is really pretty as well. Shakira has it all going for her.<br />As for her music, I know that most of you have heard her smash hit \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" that has an exotic sound to it. I love that song the most on her album \\"Laundry Service\\". Up there with the best songs is her next song - slow love song \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\". <br />I must even admit that her videos are sexy and decent at the same time. Try to compare Britney's \\"Slave 4 U\\" and Shakira's \\"Whenever Wherever\\". I can't help it, but the way Shakira prowls through the mud is extremely sexy, but never cheap. Whereas when Britney dances much too sexily in \\"Slave 4 U\\" it is just too much. I have nothing against Britney, in fact I like her music and some of her videos, but Shakira looks like an artist who will stay her for a long time.<br />All in all, I like Shakira and I hope she will make beautiful and exotic music for years to come!
B00005JKNF|4.0|And I think that is the source of the several negative reviews of this film.  It is not primarily a mystery, and people who go to see a Poirot or Marple will naturally be disappointed.  A huge ensemble of very talented stars were paid a pittance (by Hollywood standards) to work with Altman. The mystery is only a small part of the film; the characterizations and the evocation of the zeitgeist of the era are most of it.  The word &quot;ensemble&quot; is important here: there is no preeminent star stealing the show: it a a bunch of good actors, working together in gorgeous settings, under good direction.  Maggie Smith is brilliant (if a tiny bit reminiscent of Professor McGonagle).  I have been surprised that the film has not caused a resurgence of interest in the music of Ivor Novello, played wonderfully by Jeremy Northam.  This is one of those films that take good advantage of the DVD ability to easily access particular scenes.  While you will undoubtedly watch the whole thing through again, you can also go to favorite parts where the actors are particularly good. I always come away thinking &quot;Damn, that was good!&quot;
B0000025T6|5.0|Nebraska is by far my favorite Springsteen album.  While he had bigger commercial hits and individual songs may be better from some of his other albums, Nebraska is by far the best collection of songs he has released.  There isn't a single song that I skip over to get to another on this record.  The acoustic giutar and harmonica just emphasize the depth of the stories he tells in these songs.  Not his most upbeat work, but once again I think it's is his best!
B00003CXI1|2.0|This movie is simplistic, dull, and derivative escapist fantasy.  It is something like 36 hours long and most of the movie doesn't even have an antagonist... just feel-good filler to make the audience forget their unimaginative existence for a while.<br />However, there is one good thing about it.  It annoys the bible-thumping religious fanatics down south.  An unintentional side effect, probably, but a good thing none the less.  Keep at it Harry!

Even though the widescreen transfer is non anamorphic. I hear people complaining about this disc. They hate it because it's not the Director's Cut. Who cares about the stupid Director's Cut. I've seen it on Laserdisc awhile back, and not for nothing it wasn't anything special. Just some stupid pointless gory bits for 2 seconds which had me sitting there going. &quot;That's it? What the hell is so special about that?&quot;  The rest of the movie was pretty much the same. It was a waste. <br />    However though, this DVD is awesome. There's tons of cool extras like a commentary (which was in fact taken from Laserdisc). This DVD has more than what the Laser offered. It's got tons of behind the scenes footage, including a graphic Drew Barrymore segment on the tree hanging scene which is not for the weak hearted, TV commercials which I remembered some from it's release, A special effects photo gallery which again contains some pretty graphic stuff again not for the weak hearted. And More! For those people who wanted the Director's Cut, but couldn't get it on this disc. Don't waste your time. This is as good as the DVD gets. I think the studio went to great lengths putting all these extras to make it up to us. You'll grow to like this DVD. Trust me, after watching it, you'll then realize you got your money's worth.

0553275976|5.0|Tom Wolfe was once asked if the novel is dead. He replied that it's not quite dead, but it's on life support. He thinks the biggest problem with modern novels is that the novelists don't bother to do adequate research on their subject. How can one write a novel about India, for example, if one has never been to India? In Bonfire of the Vanities, Wolfe has done the research and has created an exact representation of modern city life in America, complete with politically self-serving DAs, civil rights demagogues, and pompous gold-coast dandies.<br />Wolfe is obviously a keen observer of detail. This skill combined with his mastery of the reportorial style of writing make for a great novel, and a great expose' of the hustlers and opportunists that use the system for their own self-interest. I think of him as a modern-day Sinclair Lewis, who once said that he never passed judgement one way or another, he just reported what he observed. Since most of us have probably never been in a high-rise apartment on Park Avenue or a housing project in the Bronx, it's interesting to read Wolfe's detailed descriptions down to the type of wallpaper and table centerpieces. All of this works to pull the reader into the scene, the only excess possibly being his proclivity for over-reporting clothing styles. Wolfe shows his love of clothing by using esoteric terms that probably have no meaning to the average reader.<br />Wolfe's scenes are so realistic the reader can imagine himself being in the action. I felt Sherman's fear in the Bronx jail cell. I felt his shame when lying to his wife about his relationship with Maria. The characters and dialog are so real, even though the reader may not live in that social milieu he can identify with the situation. The action moves at a rapid pace. Wolfe doesn't get bogged down with excessive narrative. He lets the characters speak for themselves--truly the mark of a great novelist. <br />I love the way Wolfe has the Brits comment on Americans. It's refreshing to see ourselves from another perspective. How funny it is to hear Peter Fallow complain about our \\"ridiculous country\\" and our lack of social graces, all the while sponging off of rich Americans at every opportunity.<br />This book is timeless. I read it for the second time recently and found it as enjoyable as the first. At the end I felt myself wishing for several more chapters. Bonfire of the Vanities should always stand as one of the best examples of American literature by one of our greatest writers.

B00005QIPH|5.0|One word...NOSTALGIA.  this cd has a nostalgic feel that is very laid back and very cool. is this it is also very simple so dont expect heavy metal rifts or julian to scream his brains out.  my favorite trac is hard to explain, a song that made me buy the record.  Hard to explain has simple bar chord structure but fast catchy lyrics.  the lead singer julian casablanca's does have a quiet monotonous voice, but it goes with his lyrics that are sung at his leisureand it actually sounds like he is drunk.  Plus there is not that much emotion in every song because this record is not an over dramatic cry baby cd. However there is emotion filled soma.  <br />Bottom line this cd is great it is simple but catchy and who needs long  drama and agony to listen to, (have u heard about pearl jam lately?).  This cd is not mainstream rock, this is underground New York, this hopefully is the new rock.

This movie definately goes by in a flash, i can't belive its three hours. I absolutely love it. I could sit down and watch it all the time. Pitts and Forlani's relationship kept me attentive and fascinated. I definately think its one of the best movies i've ever seen. It had me laughing, thinking, and even crying. And Pitts love for peanut butter was too hilarious.

B000002AGN|4.0|If I were rating &quot;Time Out&quot; based on its level of importance in the history of jazz music (or any music for that matter) it would receive an obvious 5 stars; for I consider it, along with Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; as one of the more significant post-bop 1950's recordings which pumped new life and possibilities into the world of jazz. Like Miles, Coltrane, and Ellington, Brubeck's work here is most notable for his ability to &quot;think (or play) outside the box&quot; in terms of using different time signatures, thus opening up more possibilities and musical ideas for later musicians.<br />However, from a consumer point of view I give it one star less for its brevity. I like to put a cd on and listen to it all the way through, which unfortunately takes little effort with this 40 minute recording. As for the music, it still sounds beautiful and relevant, but may be not in the same league as &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; which to me could have easily been recorded yesterday (and critics would still be raving).
B00005RY7X|2.0|Contrary to my tendency to buy an album after hearing it patiently and carefully, I must concede that I bought this CD because of the violent impression that gave me its cover depicting Andrew WK's face covered in deep red blood. While I love the cover, I just can't say the same about the music, which seems to me that is a new, pumped-up version of bands like Bon Jovi, Cinderella or Poison: a boy-band silly, beat-repeating danceable music with a little roughness in its edge. And add fried keyboards to go, please. A pity of an album, considering that Andrew's voice is really wonderful. So, if you're the Slayer type, don't waste your time like I did. Just enjoy watching the CD cover.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Words like \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"classic\\" are thrown around so often these days that I hesitate, but this is one film that truly deserves all the accolades it has garnered. This hybrid cross of Upstairs/Downstairs, Agatha Christie, and The Rules of the Game provides a richly detailed portrait of a morally complex universe where nothing is as simple as it first appears. It's really more of a \\"whydunit?\\" than a \\"whodunit?\\" The ensemble cast is flawless--in fact, there are so many perfect perfomances that it would be unfair to single one out. Suffice it to say that Robert Altman is the greatest living \\"actor's director.\\" And for a \\"cynical, old ironist,\\" he also gives us one of the most deeply felt endings in recent cinema, one that brings the entire 2 hour and 18 min. film into poignantly sharp focus.<br />Finally, Gosford Park's deliberate pacing, shifting mise en scene, and overlapping dialogue provide ample and rewarding opportunity for multiple viewings.

From the first listen through of her debut album, there can be no question that she will be a force to be reckoned with in the coming decades.  _Acoustic Soul_ is just as advertised -- very grown-up, strong soul, done with all acousting instruments and India's beautiful voice.  I see in the coming years India Arie's name becoming as recognizable across several generations as Sade. You simply cannot claim to like R&amp;B or soul and not own a copy of India Arie's album.<br />I saw her open for Sade in the summer 2000 Lovers Rock tour (after I had already bought and cherished her album) and recall her saying, &quot;I hope in my next tour you'll all come to see me.&quot;  We definitely will.
B000066NW0|5.0|From the very first time I saw 'Complicated' on MTV I was hooked. I rushed out to buy this CD and popped it into my CDplayer and was addicted beyond recovery. I you like any kind of song, this CD covers it, from slower more depressing songs, to songs that make you get off the couch, to more songs that release your feelings. When you start this CD, you'll keep it on repeat.

6305252521|5.0|Brilliant movie. I'm not sure why this movie came and went without much noise being made. Was it the fact that it was just another Jim Carrey movie... let alone Jim Carrey in a fairly dramatic role? My children almost seemed disappointed in Carrey. Disappointed in the fact that he wasn't acting like his normal characters - like Ace Ventura, Stanley Ipkiss or Lloyd Christmas. Wonderful performance by Jim Carrey and his supporting cast... Ed Harris, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich (as Marlon). A film about false reality... all the characters in Truman's life are paid actors. Halfway thru, the story really picks up when Truman starts to figure things out. It's interesting to see the home audience watching and their reactions... from the viewers in the bar, the senior citizens watching at home with their Truman pillows, the car attendents, and even the guy that is forever in his bathtub. Truman Burbank's life is a TV show, and the whole world is watching. His dilemma begins when he gets the urge to explore - as he is telling his best friend Marlon about the need to \\"get out there and see the world\\"... first stop is the island of Fiji. Naturally, the producer of the TV show (Ed Harris as 'Cristof'), wants to keep him at bay and will do anything to stop him... for without Truman, he has no show. Truman has been forever afraid of the ocean - since his father 'died' in a storm at sea right before his eyes. Now Truman must sneak away from the cameras and face the ocean to leave his so-called  reality. Cristof finds him in his boat and throws a wicked storm his way. Outlasting the storm Truman finds that the horizon isn't really what it seems. Great movie with a great ending. It makes you think about what \\"could\\" really be going on somewhere... that something or someone might be watching YOU.

B000060OWV|5.0|Folks, this CD just plain cooks. I hesitated to buy it at first because 1. he sings and 2. I was very disappointed in Supernatural. But the CD has been either in my home or car stereo since I bought it last week.<br />The band is so tight it &quot;sounds&quot; as if it were recorded live in the studio. Ford's playing is downright swamp-like raunchy at times. His guitar sound is just plain nasty, bellowing blues/rock/funk lamentations to stir the masses. And his singing is the most soulful yet.
6303607942|5.0|The first time i listened and watched this tape of my favorite pianist i was a little disappointed, but then i realized that i needed to turn up the volume.  I did just that and have already watched the tape 4 times in last 36 hours.  It really helps to turn up the volume.  The sound is more clear and the piano much more defined.  Trust me the sound quality is not horrible or just good like some have said, its great!  Of course a CD of the performance would be much better, but the visuals are just as stimulating.  At 75 Horowitz could play anything in the piano repetoire with good ease.  For the other reviewer to say that he was technically inept and poor in executing the piece is just plain ignorant.  Horowitz plays the piece both with ease and genius.  This is a great buy and excellent piece of work, BUY IT!<br />... this was no poor performance, this was musical brilliance in piano.<br />Very exciting, very beautiful, great sound, great visually, and above all it features a great pianist.
0060977493|5.0|It is no coincidence that the author is an architect.  To fully appreciate how meticulous this story is, re-read the first chapter after you have finished the book.  The story explores the meaning of lasting love, against the randomness of the hands we are dealt in life.  It is a challenging read, but the payoff is worth the effort.
B000065U1N|1.0|&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is about an American siege of the Somalian city of Mogadishu in October 1993. U.S. Rangers in Black Hawks were assigned to capture key lieutenants of Somali warlord Muhammad Farrah Aidid, but two of the helicopters were brought down. From there on, the movie was about the survival of the chopper's men on Mogadishu streets. No character development, nobody to care about. Josh Hartnett's face is all over the cover and he's hardly in the movie. Ridley Scott is on a downward streak after the horrible &quot;Hannibal.&quot; There is so much chaos going on in this movie and dudes in Hawaiian shirts jumping from alley ways shooting at anything. Bullets flied all over the place not harming anyone. I was cheering when the movie was finally over. There always has to be little kids running in slow motion with the soldiers? Just like &quot;The Thin Red Line,&quot; another boring war movie. The book is a lot better, written by Mark Bowden. This true story deserves better. If I wanted to see this much lunacy, I would have gone to a swap meet.
B00003CXTF|2.0|1.I first must start by saying that the main reason this movie wasn't good is because It wasn't completely truthful.If you want to tell the public the true story of pearl harbor you have to  include the part when the Americans dropped the atomic bomb on Japan.You can't make it was only the americans that suffered.<br />2. Secondly, the love story didn't help.It was added just to take up time.And It reminded me of Days of our Lives. It was like a soap opera thrown into a war movie. This movie had the audience so caught up into the love story that in a way it overshadowed what happened to the people at pearl harbor.<br />3. It was a total guy movie. The love story was not appealing to women because the made the woman that was starring in this movie seem shady. It was just shooting and blowing things up. And the two main male characters seemed like they were having a good time doing it.<br />Pearl harbor could of been a lot better. It reminded me of Armaggedon. Another movie that could of been better.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When I first heard some Radiohead songs, (Idioteque, Karma Police, Paranoid Android), I thought to myself: \\"What are these guys on?  This is pure and total crap.\\"  However, after a few listens to said songs, I began to like Radiohead more and more.  I then started to listen to their other songs (Pyramid Song, Knives Out;) and finally Creep made me want to buy a Radiohead album.  I bought OK Computer and I must say, it is flawless.<br />Not one moment is boring and like it's been said before, although songs aren't memorable on first listen, they grow on you.  This is the kind of album that you can listen to completely, and not even have that urge to press the \\"Next\\" button.  Highlight songs from this album include: Paranoid Android, Karma Police, and Electioneering.  Those are by far my favorite tracks from the cd.  Karma Police and Paranoid Android have gotten radio play so those are pretty well known tracks, while the lesser known Electioneering hasn't, and I must say, that song is great and highly underrated.<br />This album is perfect and much better than Kid A (more accessible than Kid A at least), so get it if you want to get into Radiohead.
B00005K3OT|5.0|i honestly didn't think this movie was worth watching, but i rented it anyway. it's not what i expected, it's really sweet and cute. i love how everyone just adored her chocolate. it's a movie for girls, a must see.
B0000027RL|1.0|Back in 1991, when I was 14 I bought this album, and thought that Pearl Jam were the coolest thing around. ELEVEN YEARS LATER, and I can see this CD for what it truly is, an uninspired, bland commercial pop knock-off.Songs like \\"Alive\\" and \\"Even Flow\\" have dated horribly in the past decade, while stiff like \\"Jeremy\\" was considered MTV-fluff even back then. If you didn't fall for the hype (like me) and wasted your money on this, then good for you. Avoid at all costs.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved this movie in English.  I was very impressed that there is also a Spanish language track on the DVD.  Believe it or not, the Spanish version might be even funnier!
B000001IPL|1.0|Okay, that is not an exaggeration. There is absolutely NOTHING worthwhile about this CD. The songs are all of that phony \\"we're so tough because we're 12 years old and have a browring\\" mentality, and all sound identical. What's even more offensive is how this was supposed to be life-changing \\"punk rock\\" or something. If you're a 10-year-old kid in 1994 who wants be \\"kewl\\" then pick this up, otherwise give it a miss.
B00005A46T|1.0|Slipknot is so bad i'm amazed that anyone actually treats them seriously (wait, does anybody?) Lyric-wise, couldn't get much worse. With 9 members, they cant all possibly be doing something to comtribute to the (horrible) music. guitar work doesn't exist, you can barely hear the guitars anyway, and if you can, it's the same chord over and over. People think slipknot is the heavyest and scaryest band around because they dress up like youre going to the circus. Amazing how the record company treats an untalented bunch of posers like the best thing in metal and no one's ever heard of bands that deserve recognition. Next time you go to the store, why dont you check out some REAL metal such as Soilwork, Meshuggah, At the Gates, Opeth, In Flames, and Dark Tranquillity (I could go on forever).
B00003CXAY|5.0|Enough has been said in the other reviews about the awesome, mystical, life-changing, meditative, and sublime power of these two movies. Now that the third film NAQOYQATSI is going to be in theaters this fall, the first two will finally be in general release on DVD. I saw both in their first release and with Philip Glass live... the DVDs will undoubtedly be worth the wait, so I am reserving my copies now! <br />Oh, did I mention I don't have a DVD player yet? I have been holding out... but *THIS* is as good a reason to buy one as I've ever had! If the transfer is done right (it should be, given the wait!) both the picture and the sound will be incredible... hmmm I may need a bigger TV screen too :-)<br />I assume most of those who will buy the DVDs are already aficionados of these films. For those who haven't seen them, let me just say you have to make both time for uninterrupted viewing and space in your mind to let the images and sound flow. They are most definitely *not* your typical \\"snacking and chattering\\" films.
0312265859|4.0|Such fun to begin a new Stephanie Plum book, especially when I discover that it's not like #7, which was a mere rewrite of its two preceding volumes. The pace is brisk, the humor is terrific (even though the handcuff gag needed to be cut by two times; humor and threes may be a cliche, but it's a true cliche), and though there was yet another person introduced who wanted to be a bounty hunter, there was only one, and most of the others have moved on (thankfully) to other vocations. The over-the-top characters were kept on firm reins, and I'll be forever grateful for that. Love the characters, but I don't love them running pell-mell over everything!<br />The plots kept me absolutely engrossed until almost the end. Then all three plots ended badly. The romance plot that has been building for eight books -- EIGHT BOOKS -- poof! gone in a couple of paragraphs!!! We readers deserved at the very least a page more, Janet. Argh, and not in a funny way. The subplot of the guy with the handcuffs: what? This is how it ends? Without tying into the main plot, without his wife killing him, without Stephanie triumphant? And the main plot: WHAT???? This is how it ends? No. Absolutely unacceptable.<br />Stephanie has been in this dangerous business for what, three years her time? And now she's in a book that has multiple plots that she isn't able to solve any of? The magic of Ms. Plum is that she's a bumbler, yes, but she'll bumble her way to solving things and bringing the bad guys to justice. In this book she has to rely constantly on men to replenish her equipment supplies and to bring the crooks to justice.<br />This is not what I buy a Stephanie Plum book for. Janet, you MUST make Stephanie more adept at her job in at least some small way, or she starts to teeter to the Too Stupid To Live borderline. You MUST have her solve her own problems, even if she bungles her way to do so.<br />I look forward to seeing her a non-Loser in her next book!
B000002U82|5.0|This is an Absolute awesome CD.  If you have not listened to it with Wizard Of Oz you don't know what you are missing.  I would really recomend buying the cd and playing it to Wizard Of Oz.  Very cool.
B000002WPI|5.0|This Wu release is still my favorite. You can just feel how raw the tracks are. Some of the newer Wu is either overproduced or weak. Every single track on 36 chambers is bangin'. &quot;Wu-Tang Clan Ain't&quot; probably the tightest track on the CD, especially INS's flow. 36 Chambers is essential if you like the Wu or any of it's members. True Shao-Lin training.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's new CD \\"Let Go\\", is a good example of what Canadians do in the music industry.  That is they write their own songs!!  Her songs are completely different then the stereotypical skater songs.  But still in the same context of skater band's theme in music.  The complications in life.  Avril brings a little bit more to the plate about what a skater is about.  From her music it would make second guess what skaters are really about.
B000068FWC|5.0|Supertramp practically *owned* 1979 with their mega-smash album from that year, &quot;Breakfast In America.&quot; The British band had been making creative, irresistible pop/jazz/rock for nine years &amp; five albums by this time, but &quot;Breakfast,&quot; the sixth album, was The Big One for the group, a #1 smash on the album charts all over the world. Though certainly not a &quot;concept&quot; album, the theme for &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; came from bandleaders Roger Hodgson &amp; Rick Davies, who, for this album, wanted to write songs about what it was like to be a British person living in the USA, which is what the whole band were doing by this time. Credit Hodgson &amp; Davies for writing such wonderful songs, such as the hits &quot;The Logical Song,&quot; &quot;Goodbye Stranger,&quot; and &quot;Take The Long Way Home.&quot; But even the non-hits are shimmering beauties, such as &quot;Gone Hollywood,&quot; &quot;Oh Darling&quot; (not to be confused with the Beatles tune), &quot;Lord Is It Mine,&quot; and the exuberant finale, &quot;Child Of Vision,&quot; all played to perfection by Hodgson, Davies (who both do great vocal work as well), sax player John Halliwell, bassist Dougie Thomson, and drummer Bob Siebenberg. This new remastered edition of &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; sounds sensational, with greater boom &amp; clarity than any CD version of &quot;Breakfast&quot; that I'd ever heard before (including the now-defunct gold disc version from Mobile Fidelity). Now you can enjoy Supertramp's all-time classic the way it was meant to be heard. Pick it up, and enjoy this delicious breakfast as only Supertramp can serve it. :-)
B00005S8FC|5.0|This review in particular refers to a gentleman who wrote that this is not tango music, no matter how long<BR>you stretch the definition of tango music.<br />Is not it almost exactly what &quot;el Pichuco&quot; Troilo told Piazzolla? <br />I have found this CD on my friend's shelf, and the presence of Gustavo Beytelmann among the invited artists immediately suggested that I should listen to it. All my expectations were right. Finally a new sound still within a tango idiom. Distinctively tango and does not sound like anything I have heard before (within tango idiom). A true tanguero of exquisite taste, may be the greatest living tango musician (and I mean it), Beytelmann would have never participated in any mediocre project.<br />Unlike other tango aficionados, I find myself able to enjoy both, De Caro and even D'Arienzo on the one end of spectra and Di Bonaventura and Rivano on the other. <br />My personal opinion is that about one third of tango music is suitable for cortes y quebradas, but it does not mean that anything else is not tango. <br />Hence, if you like the music of Beytelmann, Rivano, Javier Girotto and others pushing the boundaries of tango you will definitely like this CD. If even Piazzolla for you is still part of tango avant-guard, then, probably it is not tango for you. However it is still tango, since tango in our days is not just a dos per cuatro beat, it is a mood (and, perhaps, style). <br />Style here is tango, for sure. And for me definitely more tasteful than Mariano Mores or later De Angelis (recordings from the times when he used Hammond organ).
B000068TPN|5.0|Great casting, amazing battle scenes, and powerful emotions are all combined to give you such a wonderful experience in \\"We Were Soldiers.\\" For fans of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" I would definitely recomend this picture.  It will touch your heart and leave you breathless.  It may even bring tears to your eyes.  This film shows the passion and care that these men had not only for their country, but also for each other.  Its a wonderful movie and if you don't see it, you're missing something amazing.
B00005V9HA|5.0|This is it folks, the one and only Re-Animator dvd that you should ever own, the Millennium edition. When I first placed this wonder in my DVD player my expectations were high and after watching the first 5 mins my expectations were more then satisfied, they were no where near the quality of this DVD. The picture quality is fantastic, with clean, crisp images and the colour tones are absolutely incredible (in 16x9 anamorphic YES!!!). You would think that this movie was only recently filmed and on a budget 30 times more then what Re-Animator cost. Then there is the audio, two surround options Dobly 5.1 and DTS 5.1 and the original mono mix for the real Re-Animator buffs. The two surround sound options are incredible with good use of the back speakers for music and sound effects (especially in the rufus re-animated scene). The audio is clean and clear and the seperate speakers are easily to hear. Also, the music only option is available so you can listen to the fantastic Pyscho influenced score comming out of all 5.1 speakers. PLUS, there are two full running commentaries from 1) Stuart Gordon and 2) Brian Yuzna, Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Robert Sampson and Bruce Abbott which is a riot. The animated menus are wonderfully macarbe with all the glowing green that you could possibly put on one screen at a time. The second DVD is jammed packed with extras including deleted scenes (all in 16x9 anamorphic), interviews with Stuart Gordon, Brian Yuzna, Richard Band and Anthony Timpone and interactive story boards and a picture gallery AND even a music discussion with Richard Band AND a deleted scene. I can tell that a lot of time and effort and money went in to this edition and it is a must for anyone who loves this movie or just loves horror movies. Get it now and dig that cool flurescent green DVD case!! (One thing I forgot to put in my review was the fact that this movie has no region coding so anyone in the world can enjoy Re-Animator without having to worry about region codes! Bravo Elite!!)

0425173895|5.0|What can I say?  Since this was the first Agatha Christie book that I had ever read, I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not I would enjoy it.  To begin with, I knew nothing about Agatha Christie, and bought this book at the airport because I had a long flight ahead of me, and I needed something to read on the plane.  However, as soon as I started reading, I realized that I just couldn't put it down.  This book has everything: a widow's suicide, blackmail, deception, the murder of one of the town's most prominent men, mysterious strangers, a detective who claims to know everything, a likely suspect, and a very unlikely murderer.  I was truly amazed at the ease with which Christie was able to bring all of the characters together - As it turns out, they all have a lot more to hide than you originally suspect.  It's definitely a modern whodunit that will keep you guessing until the very end.  For anyone who has never read an Agatha Christie novel before, I suggest that you start with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd - you'll become an instant fan just like I did.
B00000J7JO|2.0|I really wasn't too impressed with this cd.  The only songs I liked from it were the singles...&quot;Scar Tissue,&quot; &quot;Around The World,&quot; &quot;The Other Side,&quot; and &quot;Californication.&quot;<br />I am sorry guys, you are a great band, but I  didn't enjoy this cd as much as I thought I would.
B0000640SA|5.0|Everybody knows the setup right. Guy looses both girl and short-term memory in violent attack. He can remember everything up to the attack, but nothing afterwards for more than 10 or 15 minutes before it fades away. Yet faced with the prospect of spending the rest of his natural life as an institutionalized, non-functioning vegetable, unable to heal the emotional wound of his wife's (murder?) because he cannot \\"feel time,\\" cannot process his pain, our protagonist \\"Leonard\\" (Guy Pearce) opts instead to focus his crippled consciousness on vengeance - even though he can't possibly remember it when he acheives it - as an \\"existential\\" redressing of the balance of the crime. \\"My wife won't be avenged until her murderer is dead; the act of killing him will avenge her; it doesn't matter if I remember doing it or not\\" is Leonard's POV. <br />So he writes himself notes compulsively and somewhat frantically, since ink on paper must substitute for working memory. The really important stuff he gets tattooed on so that nobody can deprive him of it. He takes polaroids of important people and places and writes cryptic descriptions on them. It's all a way of keeping himself vital.<br />He actually fares pretty well, all things considered. Pearce's performance conveys a certain inherent sense of humor behind the frenzy of the character in his predicament, such as he would probably require to keep himself even marginally sane within the 15 minute gamut of his consciousness. Naturally, inevitably, he does get swindled in spite of his constant and justifiable paranoia, and because \\"Memento\\" is a film noir, of course the swindler (well, one of them) is a femme fatale, a spider woman in the grand tradition, played brilliantly by Carrie-Anne Moss. Yet unlike the films of the 40's, the swindle does not destroy him and is ultimately incidental - just another memory-that-was. Leonard's condition renders him amoral, unaccountable and oblivious, a being totally \\"of the moment.\\"<br />The scenewith Moss (\\"Natalie\\") where she shows her true colors, knowing that she can say whatever she wants without consequence, is almost as hilarious as it is vicious and intense and believable.  And the whole movie is composed of similar \\"real\\" moments - \\"it's all in the incidental details that don't seem to matter,\\" to paraphrase Leonard himself.<br />And the way it's edited is perfect. Never before has a mere technical convention - that of beginning at the chronological end of the story and working backwards in overlapping segments - been so effective in conveying the peculiar quality of a character's psychology. You really feel as though you have a sense of what it must be like for Leonard, because you don't really know what's going on either.<br />It's a device, but it works. If you have to watch it more than once to grasp it, so what.
B000002WYT|5.0|After releasing the hit album \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\", Dave Matthews Band had put themselves on the map; but few knew what to expect in the future. The band had such an eclectic mix of acoustic guitar, horns, violin, in addition Dave's unique vocals, that few knew how the band would be perceived by the public eye. In 1996, two years after their first mainstream release, the band released \\"Crash\\", which debuted at number two on the Billboard charts. The album continues to hit for many reasons; constant touring, amazing live shows, great fan relations, but most important, finely crafted lyrics filled with emotion and sensitivity. Every song on the CD is filled with such emotion and passion, that many critics say it feels as though a \\"intimate studio performance.\\" Songs such as \\"Lie in Our Graves\\" are so upbeat that one can't help but smile, while the lyrics have a deeper message, to live in the moment with no regrets. In songs such as \\"Two Step\\" and \\"Too Much\\", which are acoustically impressive, Dave opens up and actually sings about ways to improve everyday life, and live a carefree existence. And yet there are also softer songs such as \\"Crash Into Me\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\", which show Dave's passionate lust for love. The album \\"Crash\\" reaffirms Dave Matthew's Band's status as a band that is here to stay. Since the album, the band has released seven more albums, continuously sells out stadiums, and is now the top grossing band of all time. Not too bad for five guys from Virginia who met at a college frat party.
B000009O8A|5.0|A great movie, but not for everyone. If you have a weak stomach dont even attempt to watch this movie. And ladies if you have ever been raped or have been threatned...dont watch this. This isnt a movie to take your date on because you will freak her out. Very violent, disturbing, nudity beyond belive. It's about a woman who is raped numerous times by 4 rednecks. Later she gets revenge on each of them, the deaths are very violent and the director used his imagination on a lot of them. I recommend this movie to everyone who thinks they can handle it. Again you need a strong stomach, and remember it is only a movie. Men, watch out for the bathtub scene, it will make you cry and never want to take a bath again.
B00005QFE5|5.0|The Road Home is a beautifully filmed, very well acted and well made movie whose simplicity masks a wide range of complex emotions and cultural commentary.<br />On the surface, The Road Home is the simple story of a man who must return his father's body to his home village, as requested by his mother, and the story of how his parents met and fell in love.  But the beauty of the story lies in this simplicity.  There is no obvious pretense or ulterior motives that appear on screen.  It simply is what it is.  But there are so many feelings and messages contained within that they cannot be put into words.  It has to be seen and experienced to truly understand.  The dialogue and music are kept to an absolute minimum, the bulk of the &quot;action&quot; is conveyed through the subtle gestures of the main characters.  Most of the dialogue is voiceover, and even then only to explain context.  American audiences(and critics especially) might not be able to grasp everything that is going on in this film, and that is a shame, because I would think that this story could relate to anybody.  Maybe it is just too simple to hold a western audience's attention, or I don't even know what their problem might be.  But for me it tells the story of my own parents, and of my grandparents, and of all of my ancestors going back forever.  It touched me very deeply and makes me long for a time when life was really this simple and pure.  Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion, and worth a viewing by anybody who can bear to sit and watch a 90 minute film that lacks explosions, blood, nudity, or even a single kiss.
B000003B6J|5.0|I don't claim to be a listener of rap anymore.  I listened back in the day.  Late 1980's, early 1990's.  This is the best rap album of all time.  It set the groundwork for all rap that followed.  I listened to the first three songs on the album in my car for an entire summer in 1990.  It never left my cassette player.  The first paragraph of Straight outta Compton, raped by Ice Cube can be considered the most furious ever rapped.  Easily one of the most influential music albums of all time regardless of genre.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|Momento, on the one hand, is a very intriguing, very well made film.  On the other hand though, I wasn't satisfied with the ending and I felt a bit cheated at having been taken for this ride that ultimately went nowhere.<BR>   This is a very well made, very creatively made movie.  It holds your interest throughout, and it twists your mind in every which direction.  This is achieved by showing you 5 or 10 minute snippets of the action in reverse order.  Yes, it begins at the end and ends at the beginning of a very strange day for our hero, which we find out is a fairly normal day for him.  The acting is very convincing and the story will keep you guessing up to the very end.<BR>   On the other hand, as I did, you might be able to figure out what is going on about halfway through if you pay careful enough attention.  I won't give it away, but ever since The Sixth Sense came out, directors and screenwriters have been jumping all over each other to come up with a twist ending to top everyone else's, and if you think about it they are all just giving you a slightly different angle on the same twist.  It was an engaging watch, but you have to ask yourself if it would still be as engaging had it been shown in the proper order?  I realize that it was the intention all along to make the film this way and I do think it is innovative and thought-provoking, but is that the only reason that it is?  Something to think about...<BR>   I can't tell my real gripe about this movie without spoiling it for those who have not seen it, and I will not do that.  But despite my problems with it Momento is still worth at least a single viewing.  Some people will love it, or some, like me, will be on the fence.  I do not regret taking the time to watch it and do not know what I would change to satisfy my problems with it, but I do recommend at least a rental.
0671027344|2.0|I didnt enjoy this book at all, it was sraight out boring. The plot was very weak and I kept waiting for something to happen, and knowing that it couldn't just end that way. \\"Charlie\\" is really annoying, and the author is trying to make it seem as if he is writing and sending the letters to the reader, but the whole thing really isn't working. I only gave it two stars because Sam and Patrick are cool characters, and the characters weren't all that bad, except Charlie...i dont recomend for you to read this book, I'm telling you now it's a waste of time!
B00005KJ1G|5.0|I got this album when it first came out and I've worshipped it ever since. Yes, Manowar are cheesy at times and even silly but they are great. They have played it straight for decades, never blinking and while they put out some horrid songs \\"Fighting the World and Blow Your Speakers\\" this first album is full of gems. <br />I think Manowar was better when R. Friedman aka Ross the Boss did more writing but we all know Joey DeMaio (the most underappreciated rock bassist) is a control freak egomaniac and limited Ross' input. Let's not forget Ross' great guitar work with the Dictators, where he shone even brighter. <br />Battle Hymns has never been surpassed by Manowar, nor most bands, it's an epic masterpiece which had their most intelligent lyrics (Death Tone, Shellshock) and set up the notch for fast fingers (William's Tale) and I was fortunate to see them on the Battle Hymns tour. They are ALWAYS great live.<BR>HAIL HAIL HAIL!!!
6302878527|5.0|&quot;Two For the Road&quot; is a lovely, seriocomic movie about the ups and downs of a long relationship between Joanna (played by Audrey Hepburn) and Mark (played by Albert Finney).  Joanna and Mark first cross paths as students traveling across Europe.  They wind up hitchhiking together and eventually falling in love.<br />The story is told through flashbacks.  We follow the couple from their early carefree infatuation through marriage, parenthood, boredom, infidelity, and finally renewal of their relationship.<br />Along the way, there are some memorable vignettes involving Joanna and Mark vacationing with another couple Howard and Cathy Manchester (amusingly played by William Daniels and Eleanor Bron) and their daughter Ruthie Manchester.   Howard and Cathy must be the most wittily neurotic twosome in movies and their daughter Ruthie is probably the most obnoxious child in movie history.<br />The performances are uniformly excellent. The direction by Stanley Donen is stylish and sophisticated. Frederic Raphael's screenplay is alternately romantic and cynical. And Henry Mancini's exquisitely beautiful score is one of this fine composer's very best.  &quot;Two For the Road&quot; is an enormous pleasure.
B00006690H|5.0|No words can explain it.  it is a CD that you need to have.  every single song on the cd is good.  A+++
B000063S6Z|3.0|As others have noted, 18 sounds like some leftover b-sides from PLAY. I have only listened this album twice now, but I don't think I will be bothering to listen again. These songs lack the originality and sonic depth of PLAY.
B00005OWIU|5.0|The music that John Williams composed on this sountract is wonderful. I love all of the songs from soundtract but my favorite is \\"Harry's Wondrous World\\", because when the movie goes off it plays it and you can just sit there and listen to it over and over again. The title makes since because Harry is in his own gigantic world and the song is like his mind. The higher notes are for the bad and some good times that he's had. The lower notes are for the good times that he's had, like the friends that he's made at Hogwarts. The other songs represent places that he has been; the events that harry and his friends have been in; the first time that he came to live with his aunt and uncle;the song for his bird and the Prologue is my second best. I love is soundtract!!!!!!!
B00005YXZH|5.0|There are not enough words to describe how perfect this album is. When my friends ask me what it's like, I just say, &quot;everything&quot;. Listen carefully and you will find the Beatles mingling with Radiohead, while Bob Dylan is brooding in the corner. It is more than anyone thought they could achieve, and is worth every penny.<br />So far, it is easily the best album of 2002.
B00005OAIE|3.0|While i have not gotten the cd yet, I have listened to them online, and after comparing them to songs that are not on this album, I find that the songs not on this album are way better. The live versions of the songs are also more soul and less pop. I think this is an artist which is best heard live, and i think some of the songs not on this cd should be included. My faves are So Comfortable, Love Soon, Why did you mess with Forever and his cover of The Police's Message in a Bottle... and about his comparison to DMB... well I like them both, they both serve different purposes. On some level its all about what is being said non?
B00003CWPL|5.0|Like all of Lynch's movies, Eraserhead is completely about mood, pure and simple. It's amazing how Lynch can conjure emotion from almost nothing.  He always goes for the jugular in Eraserhead, going exactly where you don't want him to.<br />How to describe the movie? It's a nightmare. After viewing it, you will remember it as a dream. Lynch is dead-on in creating a dream-like experience here.<br />...
0679720200|4.0|I had to read this book in French, and while many students copped out and bought the English version, I still read the French. That being said, I must say that this book for all its insights is amazing. The philosophy of Mersault is to be looked on more than the events that take place, since one is a result of the other. I found his ca m'tait gal ( It's all the same to me) that is repeated throughout the novel to be eerie and fascinating at the same time. This book is not for people who reads fluff. It is about looking at an idea of living and trying to understand it. You may not necessarily agree with it, but you can understand it. I am now reading Le Mythe de Sisyphe in French and plan to read Le Peste. If you don't think and you don't like to think, do not read this book. Once you have read this book though and you understand it, you will want to read more of Camus. I even found some of his short stories quite fascinating ( though read in English).
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a very charming, and inspiring movie.  The story, directing and acting are on a class pf their own.  Most likely one of the best 10 movies of all time.  Would recommend without hesitation.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I found it very difficult to get through this movie in one sitting. The plot and dialogue are substantially watered down to the point where my guess is that the movie only truly appeals to those under 14. Nice special effcts, virtually no plot, and a script written on an elementary school level.
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka in one word is addicting! If one understands the concept that the important is not where you are but is &quot;what's there?&quot;, this film can be a spiritual, emotional, life changing journey. <BR>It is addicting just because every time one whatches the film, deeper he/she goes and more is found there, beyond the images. The scenery an sondtrack are so rich and work so well together that this sinergy actually makes the film being felt as emotions.<BR>For me it works as a therapy.<BR>If you want to have the ultimate experience go for a big screen TV set and a 5.1 stereo sistem. But beware cause you may fly!
0312265859|5.0|Like many other readers, I could not wait to read #8. I loved this book, just like I have loved the previous seven novels. Any book that makes you laugh out loud and you cannot put down is definitely a winner. Evanovich is such a joy to read because of her humor, but also because of the characters she brings to life. There is always a new and hilarious character or two thrown in with the other main-stay characters. The scene with the Grandmother had me waking my three children at midnight because I laughed so hard that I began to cough.  I was so bummed when I finished the book because I figure we all have to wait another year for the next one.  If you want a great laugh and great story all of these Plum stories are terrific!!

B0000640VN|5.0|A excellant movie.There was some very funny parts and also some romantic. Great movie to watch with the friends and that speical someone.
0142800031|4.0|Great suspense. No gaps in story. A good lesson in history too.
B00005ATQF|5.0|This is movie is quite addecting, IT takes place from boot camp witch gives you a idea what boot camp really is like<BR>  and thean goes to the harsh hell of Vietnam, It will show you how many men went out there wanting to kill and walked back haveing more respect for life.  It is a great movie to watch late at night.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I did not enjoy this movie at all. There was sensory overload from the beginning of the film - with gaudy costumes, overacting, loud music, and no central theme. I did not find myself attached to the film - rather I wanted to fast forward through many of the scenes, particularly the singing ones (which practically encompass the whole movie).<br />This movie was disconcerting on all levels. I would have rather watched the movie in mute than listen to the singing dialogue.
B000002IVF|5.0|I bought this album on a nostalgic whim and what a whim it turned out to be. This is the David Crosby Masterpiece! Spellbinding and humbling music because when you hear an album like this you realise the difference between pure genius talent and the rest of us! Every single track is between 4 and 5 stars with Hero, Too Young to Die, Old Soldier and Through your Hands being the absolute standouts. Too all of us who survived the suicidal moments of our teens - Too Young to Die is an anthem in rememberance of those wild nights out on the road. \\"Too fast for comfort, too low to fly, too young...to die\\" And I ask any parent to attempt to stay dry eyed listening to \\"Through your Hands\\" \\"when you ask, why am I not noticed, I say - Your voice does not command! In time you will move mountains and it will come through your hands...\\" - this everybody, is celestial songwriting. Columbus Natalie and Coverage are superb and very distinct tracks. The whole album can be listened to as one piece of music again and again and again and again - and again!!!<BR>I was always a big Steven Stills fan but this album has opened my eyes (and ears) to the genius of David Crosby. To allow him to sign of this review...<br />\\"And I wonder, yes I wonder! How do you make sense of this? When the Hero...Kills the Maiden.. with his Kiss...
0316776963|5.0|This book is a bunch of short stories about a gay man in France. I know this last statement doesn't exactly sell the book, but somehow the author has wound his life into an unusual twist of little adventures that will keep you laughing through out your plane ride. Clever and funny. Not totally unlike the book THE DISTURBED WRITINGS OF ADAM COCHRAN.
B000002NBY|5.0|Graceland stands alongside Sgt. Pepper as 1 of the 2 greatest rock'n'roll albums ever made - period.
B00002E224|1.0|There couldn't be many movies more pedestrian, predictable and paint-by-the-numbers than this one.<br />Gee, do you think he'll meet someone on the train?  Think that palm reader will give them a reading?  Will that poet write a poem for them?  Will they have their obiligatory argument?  Will they go just one scene with something original?  Don't waste your time with this turkey.
B00005JKL8|2.0|Well where to begin, well if you're 12, like lots of \\"cool\\" explosions, five thousand bullets shot at the hero (with 0 hits), a supposed \\"tracker\\" who couldn't hit the side of a barn door standing two feet away with his sniper rifle, and lots of hard pounding techno music, well then this movie is for you.  And that's fine, but if you're like me and prefer more realistic movies like \\"Blackhawk Down,\\" \\"saving Private Ryan,\\" \\"A Bridge Too Far,\\" and others, you'll want to start laughing after about 15 minutes into the movie.  As far as it being a \\"true story\\" as has been claimed by many reviewers, well sorry to burst your bubble but the real story (Scott O'Grady I believe was the pilots name) was shot down in Bosnia and basically hid in a bush for three days hiding from the Serbs while he ate ants and periodically made radio calls.  Eventually his radio calls were heard and he was picked up by marines in Chinook helicopters.  Great story, it's been on Discovery Channel a few times.  But this Owen Wilson mess is far from the truth of the real story.  But hey that's hollywood and a movie about a guy in a bush for three days wouldn't put many [rears] in seats, so throw in all the other [junk] and make some money off it.  If you prefer actual history and realism over \\"flash,\\" then stear clear of this movie, if you want to see a guy trip about 15-20 \\"bouncing betties\\" all within a few yards of the hero and not even have a boo-boo, then by all means rent away and enjoy it.
B000066NW0|4.0|Such a good album! Avril Lavigne has such huge talent and she's still young. This young woman has alot going for her now and definately for the future. Her first single \\"Complicated\\" is getting massive airplay on MTV and other similar channels. Once I heard that song, I knew that she had that presence in her that she is an excellent singer. The tune is very catchy and you'll be humming that one in your head for a while. But \\"Complicated\\" is not the only one that makes this album awesome and worth you hard earn bucks. The highlights on this one is \\"Skater Boy\\", a very very upbeat bouncy rock song. \\"Mobile\\" slows it down a bit but is catchy as well. \\"Losing Grip\\" is a great start to the album. YOu'll be listening to this twice before you go to the next tracks. Unwanted is another. It might take 2 listen to know how good this song is. But my personal favorite tune in this album is \\"Im With You\\". A powerful ballad. Her voice has to be heard to beleive how good she is. I think this song means alot. I like the part when she says \\"Take me by the hand take me somewhere new, i don't know who you are but I, Im with You.\\" Boy I tell ya, that part has sheer power in it. SOunds corny but you gotta listen to it. I love this song so much. I think I listened to it at least 13 times in a row. I just put it on repeat. Im even trying to learn the lyrics which I know by now. Overall this album is a surprise. I hate albums that have 1 or 2 good songs that are tolerable to listen to a few times. But this has everything good about it. Im sure you won't be hitting the skip track that often
B00005AQF8|5.0|Snoop dogg's album 'doggystyle',is the best album of these two decades. Even though it's his first album, it's really good. It's got great songs like 'Who Am I (What's My Name)?' and 'Gin And Juice' and heaps more.
0312265859|3.0|Although I did enjoy this book, and it was a quick read, I am also getting tired of Stephanie's incompetence. If the author is going to pit her against this caliber of bad guy, she is going to have to smarten up. Also, it is getting boring to see how she always has to have either Morelli or Ranger come rescue her when the going gets tough. I think the series would greatly benefit if the author could have Stephanie grow up a bit while keeping the humour and the great supporting characters.
B00000K0DV|4.0|Sometimes it seems that Lucio, one of the better gore/horror directors to have ever graced the screen, and his releases, ranging from Zombie, The Beyond, Demonia, The New Gladiators, Four of the Apocalypse, can't get a break. Well, The New York Ripper, overly wrought with commentary about unpleasantry that \\"shocks\\" and an \\"overriding unpleasantness (that) makes it an acquired taste at best,\\" is no exception to the bias rule. Railroaded by critics for a sadistic approach to serial killing (and leaving me to wonder when serial killing became a flower picking contest in the process) and then banned by most international venues except in the most butchered formats, this exceptionally brutal film mingles many facets together to paint a bleak rendition of what drives men to murder.<br />We are given the oddities of a serial killer that chooses a Donald Ducklike voice (which is later explained in the movie) as he vents his anger on the unsuspecting female population of New York and plays mind games with the detective supposedly hot on his trail. Filled with razor blades slicing through varied body parts, throats meeting unfortunate demises, people acquiring unfortunate limps, and an almost sad ending, this movies meets the criteria of something pleasantly contrived.<br />If you adhere to the opinions of the general public, then perhaps the horror of Field of Dreams would be more to your liking. On the other hand, if you enjoy a fully uncut presentation of gore and serial killing, you'll love this.
0671027344|5.0|Excellent book that explores the mind of a teenage boy through a very innocent perspective.  This books deals with love, lust, hate, drugs, sexuality, and sex.  I hightly reccomend it!
0380789019|5.0|I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman, and I bought this book as soon as it came out. It became one of my favorite novels to read, and when I was depressed I'd hide in my room and read it for escape and pretend I was in London Below. Neverwhere is one of those books that is so easy to slip into and feel like you fit right in. The characterizations of Richard, Door, Hunter, Anaesthasia, Marquis Carabas, and the very evil, very creepy villains, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, are extremely well-done! They feel real and whole and you do care about them. The story itself is exciting and surreal and makes me proud of being a Neil fan. His writing and imagination is top-notch here, bringing up some disturbing images while also being very funny. Highly recommended to fantasy and sci-fi fans, or just people who love books.
1567405568|5.0|I am now on book 4, Temple of the Winds, and have enjoyed every one of them.  I have never read books of this type before and have found them very compelling.  One of the major things I enjoy is the continuity from one book to another.  Twenty years hasn't gone by when you start the next book.  I hope this holds true as I continue.  I listen to books on tape because I drive for a living and these books have ALL held my interest with the constant action.  I also like that while there are 2 main characters, there is becoming a wide range of supporting characters that are well defined.  Unless the series takes a serious downfall I will read them all.
6305508550|4.0|When I first saw &quot;Office Space&quot; in theatres  I was more than happy with the results.  The word funny can't really help you grasp the hilarity of this movie, and if you haven't had the chance to catch it yet don't delay any longer.  It often escapes me why this movie didn't bring in millions at theatres, instead it ended up becoming a cult classic among teenagers and adults alike.  Mike Judge did an excellent job with a movie that never ceases to have me in stitches, while Ron Livngston's portrayal of Peter is picture perfect.  <br />The DVD however is another story, it lacks many features that are deserving of such a classic movie.  Besides a scene selection screen, theatrical trailer, Dolby Surround sound and Language selection this is a lacking DVD.  The least they could of done is thrown in the &quot;Milton&quot; shorts created by Mike Judge that the movie was loosely based around.  I'll admit it's refreshing to see such a clear presentation, my VHS copy has become old and worn after many viewings.<br />Like I've said the movie is great, the DVD is a little rough around the edges and could of used more features.  But if you have the choice between this and VHS format, spring for the DVD version, the quality is noticeable, and hey at least you'll have scene selection.
0345451325|5.0|I'm a huge Halo fan, but I don't have the game, so I had to get the book.  I didn't really expect it to be great, but I was wrong.  It was one of the best books I've ever read, and I have read a lot of really good books.  It lets you get to know the characters in the game, and a lot that aren't in the game.  It also gives a new hatred for the Covenant, and shows why you fight them.  If you are a Halo fan, GET THIS BOOK!!
0312265859|2.0|I started the series with Seven Up, loved it, then read the rest. Hard Eight was disappointing. It seems rushed, unfinished. It lacks the usual joi de vivre of the previous books. The Ranger affair was badly handled. None of the characters seemed like themselves and the situations often seemed forced. I think a bit more editing and it could have been so good (if the Ranger thing was fixed too!) I hope Nine is a return to form.
020530902X|5.0|What? You don't have this one yet? This is THE essential tool for writer and student!
0679777547|4.0|This was a very odd book unlike anything I've ever read.  Fortunately, it was a very intruiging odd book, but also a book that required a vast literary background to really understand.  Every other word seemed to be an allusion to some famous classic.  Besides the fact that you MUST have read The 3 Musketeers before this book, other recommended titles include: The Count of Monte Cristo, Twenty Years After, Paradise Lost, Dante's Inferno, Mutiny on the Bounty, Notre Dame de Paris, Cyrano de Bergerac, etc. etc...<br />The story line--I supose it sort of existed--went something like this:  Lucius Corso is a cynical old bibliophile wrapped up in a mess involving two ancient manuscripts and murder.  Lots of it.  You'll enjoy this book if you've done some classical reading, and if you don't mind learning a bit (a lot!) as you go along...about about ancient book binding and printing, how the 3 Musketeers was written, and of Dumas himself.  I also found Corso's sneaking suspicion that he might himself be a character in a novel to be entertaining, especially when he wanted to \\"kick the head of whoever was writing this rediculous script.\\"  However, the ending was confusing, especially if you didn't stop to think about what was happening...but the last line was very fitting:  \\"and everyone gets the devil he deserves\\".
0312265859|4.0|I think one of the most terrible thing we as consumers can do to authors is put the pressure on them to crank out series out as quickly as possible. The eight Stephanie Plum book disappoints on so many levels it hurts - the anticipation of the Ranger-Stephanie going to bed to pay off the debt from the 7th book was a bummer - didn't happen then, but when it did in this book, it wasn't even sensual. We all enjoy a trip to Stivic's Funeral Home with Grandma Mazur, and all we got was a small review of Grandma looking under some poor guys' eyes to see what a nice job Stivic did on him. Stephanie's mother had decided to go to nursing school - no word on her finally getting on her feet. The estrangement with Morelli and Stephanie has no where else to go.<br />I agree with a lot of folks that it is time to get Janet to write am outline with feedback from her fans and time to make changes and get the zip back - don't get me wrong - a lesser Stephanie Plum book is better than other's better efforts in a heartbeat - but we have seen better, funnier and sexier and really miss that! Maybe Janet can call Patricia Cornwell and talk to her about Kay Scarpetta...
0684833395|4.0|With the advent of Joseph Heller's first published manuscript to the nation's bookstore shelves in 1961, critical reviews were far from rave.  Indeed, at first glance there seemes to be little reason why it should have been a success.  The plot, what little there is, orbits freely of its own accord, and the chronology is so fragmented that it takes a ridiculous effort to piece snippets of time and space together.  But it is the total absurdity and odd seriousness of Heller's bitter black humor that gave paranoid characters like Yoassarian and Major Major a cult following of average civilians and servicemen, if not the educated bigwigs.<br />To these perfunctory--and perhaps more cultured--readers, Catch-22 reads like one off-color joke after another.  Logical fallacies abound. Why the pilot Orr puts crabapples in his cheeks, the reader will never know...except that they are better than horse-chestnuts.  Why? Non sequitor. Milo buys eggs for seven cents on Malta and sells them to the mess hall...and still manages to make a profit using nothing but circular logic.  It is this type of bizarre humor that propels the entire book. Heller's over-the-top slapstick and conflicting logic will seem like a literary papercut to some readers.  Yawns, or even grimaces, may eventually paralyze most (normal) readers' hysterics about halfway through the mission to Bologna, but the pages keep turning.<br />There is a method to the rampant madness.  Beneath its warped surface, Catch-22 addresses the depressing, scary, so-serious-its-sick subject of total war. Heller reaches a point where he is no longer funny because everything he writes suddenly springs true.  For average non-entities like me, it rings a little too authentic.
B00005QFE5|5.0|It's nice to find movies about people in this day and age. No special effects, no fights, no guns.  This is a very simple movie and beautifully told.  Its a story about falling in love, and the pain death brings.  The cinematography is outstanding, some of the best i've seen.  What's so interesting is well, is that although this is a film about people, there is very little dialogue.  Actions speak loudly, and Ziyi Zhang, who has the face of angel, is superb.  It's impossible not to be mesmerized by her beauty.  Be prepared though, this is a happy and very sad movie all rolled into one.
6303402348|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was well put together. It was also very touching.It was funny too. You must see this movie you will laugh and cry and get happy.Very original.
B000002KHB|5.0|1972 was a good year for music, with Pink Floyd, Genesis, Black Sabbath all releasing landmark LPs (`Dark Side of the Moon', `Foxtrot' and `Vol. IV' respectively).  Deep Purple's Machine Head is perhaps top of the heap, and album which saw the band rocketing towards new heights of creative genius and commercial clout. The tour to promote Machine Head yielded Made in Japan - the live rock album of the 70s. What I want to talk about is the amazingly crisp. clear sound of the remaster - it's like hearing the album for the first time again. And if that's not enough for you the CD contains a version of the album which has been completely remixed from the 2\\" tape. Suddenly you realise how well the band's different musicians complemented each other, creating a drum/bass/organ/guitar/vocal noise which was exciting, an adrenaline rush like no other. I kid you not. The sound is fantastic.<br />I won't bore you with the track listing, nor will I waffle on about the fireworks of virtuosity coming from Messrs Lord, Blackmore, Paice, Gillan and Glover; suffice it to say that the album reads like a Best Of Deep Purple (Mk. II) compilation. For old Purple fans, this is an ideal opportunity to get reacquainted with a classic album...
0783231482|5.0|I have searched for a long time for a copy of this video and it's worth all the effort.  After years of watching commercial-inundated versions, I had forgotten how much fun the uncut original could be.  Definitely worth adding to your video library.

0790731983|4.0|Cabaret broke the mold for the Hollywood musical -- but it was so far ahead of its time that only Hair, nearly a decade later, came close to its power, and it wasn't until 2001 that Moulin Rouge finally breathed the same amount of life into film musicals, albeit in a different way.<br />Minnelli on the cabaret stage is **** (she isn't ***** only because a truly seedy nightclub singer never would have sounded this good), but offstage she's more Pookie Adams than Sally Bowles -- a mere *** with lots of obvious pathos and over-the-top takes meant to elicit laughter.  Michael York is a serviceable ****.  The real treasure here is Joel (*****) Grey, whom you can't take your eyes off of.  If not for The Godfather that same year, Cabaret would have won Best Picture and Grey might have won Best Actor.<br />Favorite brief moment:  During the opening number, \\"Wilkommen,\\" just after introducing the girls by name, Grey contrasts the cold outside with the heat inside the cabaret (\\"But in here, it is so-o-o HOT!\\"), and the girls' slinky movements that culminate with fingers jabbing once into the air is eerily hypnotic -- the creepiest thing in the film.<br />Favorite musical number:  \\"Money\\" -- it was pretty much everyone's favorite, as the movie audiences I saw it with always broke into applause at the end.  (Applause for imaginary figures on a wall -- I never figured that out.)<br />Most interesting moviegoing note:  I saw this movie several times in a town heavily populated with elderly Jews -- several of whom walked out during the \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\\" number.<br />Give Cabaret the credit it deserves.  It was the first movie musical for people who don't like movie musicals.  There haven't been enough of them (the movies, not the people).
B00005JKCF|4.0|Not being very big on the comic series Spider-man, after seeing the movie I realized that the movie was very good, although I think that i would have gotten much more out of it if I had been more into the comic series.  I went to see this movie with my best friend Russell, who was very much so into the comic series, so he helped explain a lot of the things that were confusing me.  He explained to me where the Green Goblin comes from,and  all the other stuff.  Over all The movie was excellent, I don't think that the actors chosen could have been picked any better, and the story line was very good also, I can't wait for it to come out on DVD, so that I can buy it, and I also can't wait  for Spider-Man 2 to come out.
B00005U122|5.0|The quality of this recording is incredible. The selection of songs for the concert was very good. ... I have watched many concerts in DVD and this is one of the best. For me, this one and U2's Elevation are my favorites by far.
0694013889|5.0|This book immediately became my two year old daughter's favorite book.  When I started training her we discontinued diaper use except for nap/bed times and used cloth training pants.  She started calling herself Prudence when she went to the potty.  I think her success has a lot to do with this book/video.  If you get the book you should get the video.  The \\"Potty Song\\" is a real hit in our house.
B00000IREA|5.0|What is it about this movie? Partly it's Jane Fonda, possibly at her physical peak and in lots of different sexy outfits (then of course there's the opening sequence). But also, for me, it's the period - a late sixties movie where the hippy ideas of the time have crept into the movie. Ironically, despite the setting, it's this element that contributes to the entertainment value. Even the music (also very good) is strongly sixties, as you'd expect.
038533558X|5.0|You know a book is great when you get mad if anyone tries to talk to you while the book is in your hand. This is a great book that grabs you in the first chapter and never lets go. The plot twists and turns and the characters develop in ways you never expect. The ending is a little pat, but even the very last page is a surprise, and a good one, leaving the reader satisfied. Your family may not see you for awhile once you begin this book. It is that good. This is Coben's best book yet.
B000005IRG|5.0|Originally bought this vinyl in may 77, thougt it boring on first listening, as I´d expected something like Sex Pistols. The second time I put the needle in the groove some six month later on a boring atumn afternoon and in an instant got hypnotized by the swirling guitars, strange singing, mysterious lyrics and the naked production.<BR>This is a must have if your interested in rock music or guitars...
B00005Y228|3.0|The popular track from this recording, &quot;can't get you out of my head&quot; is slightly more edgy and adventurous than the rest of this very likable dance album.  Every song is a throbbing dance number, with rather trite lyrics.  The album is completely ballad-free, just as it is free of any real instruments: all instrumentation is synthasized, as is  Ms. Minogues voice on some tracks.  Unlike most popular dance CD's, the level of the songs is very consistent, with only one or two 'fillers'.  Other songs on the album, such as &quot;fragile&quot; and &quot;come into my world&quot; are very infectuous.  A very good effort for a dance recording.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Mayer does an excellent job with this album. Lyrically it's among the best i've heard. Mayer has a smooth &quot;honest&quot; voice, and his guitar ability is above average. This is a fine CD, don't listen to the negativity.
6305077630|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer. This is a great movie, but why would anyone pay $[money] for a DVD when most DVDs are selling for around $[money]? For that price it should come with the software that the two geeks used to make the girl! I still give the movie five stars though. Along with Ferris Bueller's Day Off it defines the classic 80's teenage genre. Go rent it for now until the price for the DVD comes down.
B000002OX7|5.0|last night, i heard the sad news on a new york rock station that The Who's quiet man, john entwistle died of a heart attack in las vegas at the young age of 57.  The Who was about to start touring this summer but sadly it may not happen.  the ox cannot be replaced!  he, pete townsend and roger daltrey is, was, and will always be the greatest rock and roll band of all time!  the late keith moon made a great contribution.  so did keith jones who joined the who after moon's death.  even the young drummer who played with The Who at the 9/11 benefit concert @ new york's madison square garden late last year was fantastic!  i also must say here that the same rock station played 'who's next' in its entirety last night @ 10pm.  THIS IS THE GREATEST ROCK ALBUM EVER!  BAR NONE!  just look at the songlist!  LOOK AT IT!  THEY ARE ALL LANDMARKS!  even entwistle's beautiful \\"my wife\\".  i forgot he sang that and he did it perfectly!  for the youngsters out there who are starting to become Who fans, make this cd a start.  better than the beatles?  for me, yes.  better than the stones, yep!  better than led zep?  oh yeah! i don't recall The Who making a bad tune.  those others bands did!  not The Who!   the ox is now rocking with The Man Upstairs.  he will be missed.
6302256615|1.0|This was a horrible movie to say the least. I was greatly disappointed. It was highly immoral and most of the people hardly had any clothes on. Besides that kind of stuff, the movie portrayed the rebellious, thieving bad guys as the good guys. By the end of the movie, you actually started to feel sorry for the bad guys. <BR>Not worth anyone's time.
B00005B36H|5.0|Unlike many, I wasn't properly introduced to Tool until after the release of Lateralus,  but it still was the last CD of theirs I got my hands on.  The evolutionary track the band has taken is awe-inspiring in this album.  Not only is it full nearly to bursting of music, I honestly can't think of any part of this disc I don't like.<BR>Maynard's vocals and lyrics again shine through as the gems they are, and his voice is taking on new facets and details with every project he does.  Danny Carey's drum playing has moved from brilliant rythmic genius into the realm of god-like melodious beauty.  His drumming could be all that was on the CD and as an album it would be brilliant.  The guitar work is as juicy and provocative as ever.<BR>This is the best offering from Tool yet, and even though some frown on the idea of &quot;concept&quot; albums, this is quite possibly the best album ever created.  Whenever I have lost faith in the world, I listen to this album, and my faith in human existence is restored.  It's that good.
B000060P79|5.0|the songs on this cd are the anthems of teenagehood. no other lyrics can represent us this well. i live in their home town (montreal) and i never understood what all the hype was about. then one my friends passed me an earplug during french class and perfect came on. man did i look freaky! i was staring straight the teacher with glassy eyes and a huge smile. the song was just too amazing. the thing i like best about them is that they're new, so the band is still about the music and the fans. but once they start touring internationally in the fall.. *shakes head* hope they don't forget us homies!! wish them the best, they definitly deserve it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Hey,it's STAR WARS!! Who cares what the critics think!! Just enjoy the incredible visual and special effects, great stunts, vast array of creatures and aliens, a young Obi Wan Kenobi etc.. and ESCAPE into two plus hours of fun and excitement ...'nuff said!!
0312265859|3.0|Number 6 and seven held such promise for Steph and Ranger's first time togther, but when we finally did get to it it was HALF- a paragraph.<br /><br />I mean serously, with all the hinting and the danger that Ranger present you would think he would be a...\\"I'm taking you as my woman pose\\", but instead we got\\"i'll roll over and let you run back to the cop\\". So not happy with this right now. I think if she wasn't going to flesh the characters out or even make the scene between Steph and Ranger worth it, she should have left it to our imaginations.<br /><br />Apart from that the story was o.k. the characters weren't as fleshed out as they used to be, but i still had some laughs, not as much but enough to say i'll keep the book.
B0000033TE|5.0|ELP possibly created their most grandiose, yet refined studio album (at least before they started to tread downhill relationship and/or creativity-wise). _Brain Salad Surgery_ is one crazed ride that seldom gives you time to catch your breath. It starts off with the patriotic and anthemic hymn \\"Jerusalem\\", then proceeds into the crazed Miles Davis-ish interpretation of Alberta Ginastera's \\"Toccata\\". This is an extremely challenging piece to follow, as the time and tempo changes are switching left and right. \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\" is arguably the only accessible moment on the disc. This Greg Lake ballad has some nice trippy wah-wah pedals. \\"Benny The Bouncer\\" continues in the tradition of ELP's humorous honky-tonk (i.e. Jeremy Bender, The Sherriff).<br />\\"Karn Evil 9\\" is the centerpiece of the album, clocking in at 30 minutes. It's based on the world being dominated by computers (which is not far from the truth today). The 1st Impression (Parts 1&2) is definitely the most energetic movement out of the three. It features Carl Palmer doing some complex drumming and Keith Emerson doing Hendrix-ish solos...on his keyboard. Greg Lake, while doing an excellent job on his vocals/bass, actually delivers some kick a$$ guitar solos. Trust me...this stuff rocks hard...yet the rhythm section is NOT based on heavy guitars. That's innovation for you! The 2nd Impression is a jazzy/classical instrumental, which is probably the most technical out of the movements, as it showcases Keith Emerson's dazzling keyboard skills. Greg Lake has some great bass playing on here. Carl Palmer is not ignored either, as his virtuoso drumming skills are displayed as well. The 3rd Impression is the most 'innovative'. It may seem like instrumental boredom to some, as Keith Emerson's swirling, mind-warping and metallic synths do most of the walking and talking here.<br />This remastered version contains the 3-D cover art, as well as extended photos, insightful liner notes that reveal the actual meaning of Brain Salad Surgery and more. Don't ignore the 13-minute interview at the end, as it sheds light on the band, this particular album, as well as hilarious insights on meeting the dark surrealist H.R. Giger, creator of the album art.ing of Brain Salad Surgery and more. Don't ignore the 13-minute interview at the end, as it sheds light on the band, this particular album, as well as hilarious insights on meeting the dark surrealist H.R.

B000021YQV|5.0|System Of A Down gave us the unarguably best album ever in Toxicity.  The two songs that brought them from an easy to achieve amazing to an much tougher mainstream amazing, Chop Suey! and Toxicity are not the best songs.  The hidden gems are definitely Psycho and the best opener ever, Prison Song.  The end song, Aerials, is another song worth praising.  While mainstream sucsess and amazing content are tough to have, Toxicity more than gives it, adding System Of A Down to the greats list.
0312117337|5.0|I found this deck to be absolutely amazing! I find that it doesn't work well to respond to specific happenings but instead allows the person to see what is happening internally in response to a specific event. Tha's why I think it a wonderful deck to find out what's going on with myself why or why not something is occuring what can I do with myself to achieve those things I want to achieve. This is the first deck I've found that works with me to find out about me.
0316776963|2.0|I read this book because an acquaintance claimed it was one of the funniest books he'd ever read. The stories are neat and well-written, but not unusually funny. The comedy is mainstream and fairly common, meaning that it can very easily be duplicated. Most readers could themselves come up with stories about their own lives that are equally funny. Mild humor, I laughed out loud only once. This book is highly overrated. If you're interested in the true comedy, read PG Wodehouse.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let go has become one of the greatest cd's I've ever listened to.  This 17 yr old girl has so much talent its to hard to handle.  She's so sassy but unbelievably cute.  She has her own unique style and she would be a great role model for children as well as teens.  She speaks her mind on this cd for example the song anything but ordinary she says she wants to be anything but ordinary she has changed my life so far and I'm sure she will influence many more.  From one band member to another she has what it takes.  I believe this beauty has a long life line in the world of music.  This cd makes you want to be you and not listen to other people.  This cd will be played in my stereo for a long time until she comes out with another cd.
B00003BDXG|4.0|Plot summary:<BR> <BR>Mickey and Mallory Knox is a pair who shares an undying love for one another that is as immense as their fame. But they aren't your average stars. What they did in order to achieve their fame, that drove the media just absolutely nuts and brought about millions of ardent fans, was kill people... a lot of people. (Among the millions of fans, a teenager acknowledges to the TV cameras that \\"mass murder is wrong. But if I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory.\\") <br />Commencing with the murdering of Mallory's sexually abusive and insensitive beer-bellied slob of a father, and grossly negligent mother, the couple set off on a killing spree across the country, leaving one person alive at the end of each massacre \\"to tell the tale\\" in order for them to get credit for their crimes. When their killing spree is thwarted and they are finally caught by the police, they have by then gotten so much recognition by the media, who had followed their every move, that they are treated more like envied celebrities than depraved, cold-blooded criminals. <br />The lowdown:<br />Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers is one of the most controversial films that I know of, so it goes without saying that it outraged many. Yes, the movie was very violent, but what I think really got to the viewers, wasn't so much how violent it was, but rather the way it reacted to violence, and that was what was truly shocking. When I watch Natural Born Killers, I see a film that shows us how big an impact the media can have upon people, how they can easily blow things way out of proportions by making killers heroes and how they have so much power over people that they would make them see things the way they do. I also see a film that is meant as a warning as to where we may be heading and what may become of us in the future in a world where violence is the number one fascination. And, although it is a very violent film, when I watch it, I see a film that doesn't so much inciteit but shows us the true nature of violence. (For example, Stone displays images of both Mickey and Mallory's past experiences with their abusive parents as kids, that way showing us that they have since wounded them emotionally, and that they are the subconscious driving forces behind their violence.)<br />Although many did not perceive the point that was trying to be made here and didn't appreciate Stone's film, I loved it...I absolute loved it. There are things about it that have me asking for more, that drive me to watch it over again and again: The frenetic pace and rich cinematography, which ranges from outlandish multi-colored camera angles to documentary-style black-&-white, from video to film, and from sitcom-style to newsreel parodies, and even animation. Stylistically, the film is an outstanding achievement. <br />Another were the performances by Robert Downy Jr. as Wayne Gale, an edgy, bloodthirsty host of a tabloid television show who's immediately enthralled by Mickey and Mallory, Tom Sizemore as Jack Scagnetti, a corruptive detective who has a little crush on Mallory and who thinks that committing murder himself will flatter her, and Tommy Lee Jones as Dwight McClusky, a sinister warden who believes that all criminals are scum, regardless as to how the media depicts them as being. But naturally, the most notable of all were Woody Harrelson's and Juliette Lewis's as none other than the cold-blooded killers themselves. Harrelson and Lewis ignited on screen, and fully engrossed me by their performances. The two are capable of being both frightening, as they devoid of any sympathy toward others, and pitiful, as we see that they are still haunted by the abuse of their parents that drives them to kill these people. Woody Harrelson is one of my favorite actors. You may remember him as the dim-witted but warm-hearted and absolutely adorable bartender from the popular eighties sitcom, Cheers. He was the only one outta the gang to have a successful movie careerin the years that followed, and with a film like Natural Born Killers, it shouldn't take a genius to figure out as to why. But there's more to Harrelson than the performance as to why he was so perfect for this roll; his very face has the likeness of a killer, in that he just looks so damn evil. In a film like this, it is vital for the perfect casting job, it is vital to have actors who we can really believe... I was persuaded.<br />When I first watched this film in its entirety, I was immediately hooked by the psychedelic directing and eye-catching visuals, the overall exciting and invigorating experience, and was left breathless throughout the prison riot in the finale that was as disturbing as it was vehement, as bodies were seen piled like stacks of dirty laundries or hung as cows would be in a slaughterhouse throughout Mickey and Mallory's attempt to escape with the help of Wayne Gale, and prisoners were seen, if not seen torturing and killing the guards, doing so to each other like savage animals once freed from their cage. I watch it now as an eighteen-year-old, and the film still has the same effect on me as it did then, and that's because Oliver Stone is the sort of director who'll be willing to go beyond the limits and who'll do anything to get his message across-and that's what I value about him. This film's a masterpiece!
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This movie raised the bar for directors and actors alike.  DD will be loved or hated, no room for middle of the road folks.  Regardless of if you are a fan of Independence Day (or similar movies) you &quot;will&quot; talk about this movie.  As stated in other reviews, the cinematography is outstanding and the acting is incredible.  A must see for avid movie fans!!
B000007NYS|4.0|First of all, the only bad thing about this album is that it sounds like it was produced when it was produced (1988) and it just doesn't have the &quot;umph&quot; that I think it could have.<br />That having been said, the songwriting is great, and the music sounds good.  My favorites are &quot;Crescent City&quot;, &quot;Big Red Sun Blues&quot; (if Jimmy Buffett could write songs this good, I might consider buying one of his records), and of course, the beautiful &quot;Side of the Road&quot;.  All the songs are great, the only thing is, although I like &quot;Changed the Locks&quot;, Tom Petty's version rocks so well, that this one is pale.  The story about the song (included in the CD) even making it on the CD is a good one, though, and shows that Lucinda knows what she's doing.<br />If you like Lucinda's other stuff on &quot;Essence&quot; and &quot;Car Wheels&quot; then you should pick this one up.  It's a good album to listen to in the car, and in general, a pleasant album that won't rock your world, but will give you something to sing along with.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I'm writing this review in response to the review by another poster who claimed that &quot;Never Again&quot; somehow glorifies domestic abuse. Far from it. It's by FAR my favorite song on the CD, because it takes a horrible topic and presents it how it should be presented; with raw, focused rage aimed squarely at the cretin who's beating the snout out of his wife. It's nice to hear the story of a reprehensible coward getting his due for a change. (The wife shoots him at the end of the song) This song doesn't glorify domestic abouse, it rightly glorifies those who FIGHT BACK!
6304602979|2.0|There is a unrated special edition coming in september of 2002, so you might want hold off on getting this now. I don't know the specs or special features but it has to be better the the bare bones disk.
0312265859|5.0|Writing a book series must be terribly difficult, especially after the first few. Expectations can be unrealistically high. So I almost didn't want to begin this book and be disappointed. However, without a doubt, \\"Hard Eight\\" is Evanovich's best in the Stephanie Plum series. This character-driven book had me laughing out loud (Lula, Grandma Mazur, Bender et al) and hyperventilating (those delicious Ranger passages). And I will not spoil the will-she-or-won't-she teaser. You'll have to read it yourself to find out:)
B00004Y62T|5.0|Here is the basic overview of the movie:<br />Tom Ripley [Damon] is a reserved and odd guy, who believes it's better to be a \\"fake somebody than a real nobody\\". He gets a perfect opportunity to prove his point, when a wealthy shipbuilder pays him to go to Italy and bring back his easygoing and \\"playboy\\" son, Dickie Greenleaf [Law]. Ripley tells Dickie that he was an old classmate of his at Princeton, but Dickie doesn't remember. Dickie and his girlfriend Marge [Paltrow] welcome Ripley into their lives, and Ripley is soon fascinated and drawn into Dickie's lifestyle..complete with jazz music, glamourous trips around Italy, and of course, the women, haha. The more that Ripley gets drawn into Dickie's lifestyle, the more he craves it..and the more that Dickie is \\"creeped out\\" by Tom Ripley. After a confrontation between Ripley and Dickie, Ripley's life is changed forever..leading to lies, impersonation, and even murder. This movie has so many crazy twists, almost any prediction about the ending could be true. You'll have to see it though to find out:)<br />This is one CRAZY movie. At first, I was really hesitant upon seeing it, because the length of it scared me [almost 3 hours long!], plus, one of my friends that saw it in the theatres told me that it wasn't all that good. But as some of my friends and I were watching movies one day at my house, I lost a bet so we had to end up watching this, haha. I'll admit, the first 15 minutes of this movie was BORING, I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep. But that's also how I am, I hate the introductions in movies, I like getting right to the point. I'm glad I stayed with this movie though, it was well worth the wait, even more so..<br />Plus, Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors..and after having watched this movie, I have another favorite actor..JUDE LAW! The casting is so awesome in this movie, every role was played well by each actor, and at times you forget that Matt Damon is well..Matt Damon because he portrays Tom Ripleyso well. Oh, and the first nightclub scene where Jude Law & Matt Damon are onstage singing \\"Tu Vuo' Fa L'Americano\\" is classic!<br />I can't emphasize enough how suspensful this movie was..especially the last half of the movie. It's like it kept jerking you around..right when you think you've figured out what's going to happen, something new and unexpected happens in the plot. So the plot thickens, right?<br />It IS a long movie, but the time literally flies by while watching it. If you like suspense and unpredictable plot twists, then this movie is perfect for you!:)
B000066AXC|4.0|This was a very good movie but I thought that is slowed a bit in the middle.  Many have pointed out the fact that it is not historically correct and this seems to be true, but.  In my opinion this movie is not about historical correctness, not about the fabricated love affair on screen and the left out affairs with men.  BUT (there is that word again) this movie is exceptional with it's interpretation of how strong the human mind can be.  The old 'mind over matter' is something that most people do not realize the strength of.  John Nash had an incredibly strong mind and it shows him overcoming mental problems, with help from his love.  I don't think this is quite realistic but it is a good presentation never the less.  <br />Buy it, rent it, but watch it for what it is.  Not historically correct, not entirely what folks have said but something that can be enjoyed and make you think.  Make you own choice after the viewing (and write a review)!
B0000214F0|5.0|Caligula is the best erotic movie of all times. Brass makes his only masterpiece with the colaboration of the best art director Danilo Donaty (colaborator of Fellini) the great story of Gore Vidal and the best of the best;Malcolm MC.Dowell and Peter Otoole. The photography is excellent, the ambientation cant be better and the scenography spectacular. Just to say that I have seen Caligula mora than 10 times.

They need to be ska there arent any trumpets in it any more
B000001FXR|5.0|Okay, now let's get down to the basics. Bob Marley is disputedly the greatest performer in the last century. One doesn't get that sort of prestige by accident. When starting a collection of music from a person such as him, you can't help but to ask yourself, &quot;Which one should I start with?&quot; right? Well here is the answer. This album is Bob Marley at his best. With songs like &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; and &quot;400 Years&quot; filling this album up with great beats and powerful lyrics this album is definitely the one. I have almost every Bob Marley album there is and this one is still my absolute favorite.
B00003CXB7|4.0|The title song sums up perfectly the mood of the film:<br />The game of life is hard to play;<BR>I'm going to lose it anyway;<BR>The losing card I'll someday lay;<BR>So this is all I have to say:<br />Suicide is painless;<BR>It brings on many changes;<BR>And I can take or leave it if I please.<br />The only way to win is cheat<BR>And lay it down before I'm beat;<BR>And to another give my seat<BR>For that's the only painless feat.<br />Suicide is painless;<BR>It brings on many changes;<BR>And I can take or leave it if I please.<BR>And you can do the same thing if you please.<br />Robert Altman's seminal film gives us an inside look at how a group of surgeons at a military base during the Korean War cope with the reality of conflict and human violence. Suicide is an apt metaphor for the stepping outside of conventions (the American way, authority and regulations, morality) the soldiers undertake in order to deal with the harshness of war. They choose anonymity, opting to forget the outside world, instead forming their own society, the mechanics of which eschew authority and convention. Altman's characters lay aside obligations, loyalties, and traditional codes of conduct. Along with them, we almost forget that these are men with families and histories; that is, until the final moments when they, along with us, are abruptly brought back to reality as they prepare to leave and go back to 'ordinary life'.<br />The movie plays like a series of variations on this theme, many of the film's episodes functioning as allegories of human conflict and its corollaries. It certainly doesn't major on plot, but rather is sustained by a host of interesting characters, sharp and often hilarious dialogue and excellent performances. Altman brings a certain naturalism out of his actors, and impeccable timing in the more comedic moments.<br />It would be a mistake, however, to see the comedy as a trivializing of violence and death. On the contrary, this is a deeply serious film, whose toneis clear from the outset, where Johnny Mandel's melancholy rhythms and harmonies suggest pain beneath the comedic exterior. Throughout the film, tragedy is never far from laughter. Comedy has always been the vehicle of serious comment. So it is with M*A*S*H. Not only is the absurdity of war itself brilliantly satirized, but Altman takes a poke at how Hollywood has dealt with the subject. The score frequently recalls the kind of stirring, patriotic tunes heard in old war movies, only to offset the effect by highlighting the farce of war, smashing false notions of glory and romance to pieces. This is a highly introspective film, and several of Altman's touches are there to remind us of the power of film, and perhaps the responsibility upon the shoulders of film-makers. There are frequent references to the old war movies, reminding us that M*A*S*H, at least in the eyes of its makers, stands in a different category together, a new subset of the war genre.<br />It will be up to the viewer to decide whether Altman's new treatment of the themes of war and violence is really any more truthful than those of a few decades earlier.

0312265859|3.0|I really love Stephanie Plums' novels and eagerly await the next book each year.  I was born and raised in Hamilton Twp., have relatives who live in the Burg and on Hamilton Ave and have visited the ER at St. Francis more than I like to remember.  It really is a trip home for me.  However, the books are beginning to get a bit monotonous.  Steph whines and bungles and never goes forward, Morelli and Ranger are lacking depth and cars  blow up too often.  I would love to see Janet take a fresh direction.  Same old, same old is how I felt about Hard 8.  While I look forward to the familiarity of the old neighborhood, the story line is getting to be pretty boring.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Listening to this album puts me in a trance. How many music collections can actually do this? Not many, that's for sure. A truly rare treat! A beautiful, young woman with a voice that is beautifully textured and magnificent. Norah Jones should win the Best New Artist Grammy, and the awards shouldn't stop there. I'm a loyal Canadian, and I support Avril Lavigne as a fellow Canadian. But, I must say \\"Sorry Avril!\\" You've got nothing on Norah Jones. <br />A throw back to the glory days of Billie Holliday and Etta James, Norah, 23, has the poise and maturity of an artist twice her age. Powerful, expressive, and passionate, each song on this debut album is a work of art. 'Come away with me' is a gorgeous original ballad that sounds like it could be a Billie Holliday classic. 'Cold, Cold Heart' is covered beautifully (Hank Williams would be proud), and 'Painter's Song' is haunting to the bone. Her approach is layed back, gentle, but still powerful and emotional. I don't for a second regret buying this album, and neither should anyone else. Norah is a rare talent that comes along once in a blue moon. And for such incredible, classy music to come from someone so young is even more amazing. A worth while purchase that will never grow old. Timeless!
0553269631|4.0|This novel is just plain well-written.  It not only provides ample character sketches, but also supplies the reader with a good plot.  The novel is centered around a deaf man named Mr. Singer, whom four lost souls look to as their own version of a saviour.  Mr. Singer's mystery is yours to solve.  The other four characters have beautiful struggles to save themselves from their innermost thoughts and desires. McCullers truly and honestly expresses human emotion in a moving way that is never sappy or gratuitous. The book does get a bit boring and longwinded at points, but you will soon pass them and be rewarded with a plot twist or more gorgeous prose. A good book to add to your list.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Don't call him stupid, because at the end of the day - Forrest is not consumed by a world of greed, lust, prejudice, and pride. This movie is not about idolizing an idiot. It's about seeing life through the eyes of a less fortunate, mentally challenged man. He charishes what we all seem to take for granted, and is not a slave to possessions like the rest of us. Tom Hanks is absolutely amazing in this movie. Not once did I think of him as anything other than Forrest Gump. Like life, this movie is like a box of chocolates. But if you have good taste - you'll enjoy every piece.
B00006690F|4.0|This is a really good CD. I've haven't really been that big a fan of Em's till I heard \\"Without Me\\", then I just had to hear the rest of the CD. It suprised me at times and was worth the buy. It's the best CD I've bought since \\"Invincible\\" by Michael Jackson last year. So buy it, you won't regret it.
B000000H66|5.0|Death pumps out another amazing cd with the release of Symbolic. This album is very heavy, and yet it is also very melodic. Great guitars, I love the solo in Zero Tolerance. Every song on the album is really great, from the melodic intro to Empty Words, to the sheer heaviness of Misanthrope, and the soft outro to Perrenial Quest. Death never made a bad cd, and this one definitly stands out as one of their best. If only Chuck could have stayed around and released more masterpieces with Death.
0316666343|5.0|This is not a perfect book, but it is a perfectly wonderful read --one of the best I have enjoyed in years.  (and I'm very picky).   THE LOVELY BONES is about the rape and murder of a young teenager, her observation (from heaven) of family and friends on earth, and it is about the healing power of grief. It is disturbing, haunting, lovely, painful, magical, hopeful, lonely, warm and funny.   There are certain phrases and paragraphs that you will want to re-read because they resonate.  You won't be able to put it down and then towards the end you will want to make the book last longer.  It is strange and wonderful.
B000002H2H|5.0|I own all of Metallica's old cds, and I have to say this one is up there right next to Master of Puppets, another one of Metallica's best. The misleading opening to Fight Fire with Fire quickly changes into one of Metallica's fastest songs. Fade to Black is another masterpiece on the cd.It's a slower song with a great ending.Other highlights include pretty much all of the other songs on the cd, except Escape, which just isn't quite up there with the rest of the songs. The cd also has an insturmental at the end, Call of Ktulu. Anyway, if you don't already own this, go out and buy it now. You shouldn't be dissapointed!
0312265859|3.0|You can always count on Stephani's antics to give you some laugh out loud moments. In this stressful world it's nice to know you can still pick up a book by authors like Janet Evanovich and get away from it all. We can all relate to the things that happen to Stephani and her friends. I'd like to see more of Grandma Mazur she is such a riot!
0312265859|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Stephanie has some really bad days.<BR>She keeps you entertained from the beginning to the end. I laughed out loud at some of the stuff the poor girl gets into. I was glad to see that Lula was back. Janet adds a couple of new characters.  I really enjoyed Albert Kloughn.  I can't wait for number nine.  Janet just keeps getting better and better
B000058983|5.0|If the Velvet Underground is often subjected to the cliche of being the dark shadow to the San Francisco hippie scene, then Love deserves its place in history as the band that acted as a double-agent in that den of narcissism and 'peace and free love'. Without question, the history of this album will forever play a part of listening to it, but that is all. Unlike other pieces of music from the summer of 1967, this album sounds not the least bit dated, and remain as ahead of the game today as it was then. <br />Not the least bit hippie fluff, this is actually as dark as an album can get, since it was begun as, if not a suicide note, then certainly a disintegrating young man's final words, before reaching redemption. This is a difficult album to connect with, certainly, especially the second half. Forced to describe this album in a sentence, I'd say that it could be likened to The Beatles' masterpiece &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; stretched across the length of an entire album. The strange orchestration, existential dread, depression and subversive pop qualities are present all across the board on 'Forever Changes'. <br />'The Daily Planet' is a prime example of this. It features a drum beat that you can easily picture as the pace of a person walking down the street as part of their everyday routine, or the spiral of the planet spinning around, perpetual and unchanging. Arthur Lee's words &quot;In the morning, we arise/ And start the day/ the same old way&quot;, the brief but poignant guitar squalls and overlapping vocals compound the dread.<br />'The Red Telephone' mocks hippie paranoia with its chanted outro of 'Freedom' and the voice of an old black man saying &quot;All God's children gots ta have dey freedom...&quot; Funny, that. Lee does indulge in paranoia of his own, but a personal kind, of a man retreating into his own mind. &quot;I just don't want you using up my time,&quot; he sings, to no-one.<br />The extensive liner notes do a far better job of detailingthe paranoia in these songs than I ever could. Just know that this album is wonderful, and Arthur Lee will always be a closer kindred spirit to experimental pop geniuses Lou Reed and Brian Wilson than to Jerry Garcia. With that in mind, buy this album.
0140186409|5.0|This book cannot but be considered one of the greatest works of American literature.  Its plot is simple, almost literally pedestrian, but it magically conveys the feelings not just of its characters, but of an entire social movement and era.<br />The device of alternating chapters between the tale of the Joad family and descriptive narratives of the society around them only strengthens things.  This is no academic, dusty view of history; this is reality, as people lived and thought and experienced.<br />The human attachment to the soil, the desire for home and community, the struggle for social justice, the tyranny of property, the myth of the Promised Land, the hope and dreams of a new life - there is something here on every level, the social, the spiritual, and the emotional.<br />The beginning of the novel is a bit slow, but it slowly picks up momentum as it travels west.  By its end, one cannot but be riveted by the Joads and the struggles they endure.  And one can feel the grapes of wrath building, the knowledge that some way, somehow, the human will to survive can never be defeated.<br />But, despite its clear social messages, this is not a political tract.  The novel's ending takes one of the most intimate of human actions into a bare, stark necessity.  Eroticism, motherhood, generosity, desperation - what is it?  We cannot tell for sure, but we know only that it is human.  The most horrific of our trials only serve to bring out our humanity.  A haunting and unforgettable message.
630522577X|5.0|Well, I just picked this up and it is delightful.  Real chemistry between Harrison and Hepburn.  The dvd has a cool feature where you get to hear Hepburn's actual voice in two songs and it makes you wonder why they felt the need to dub; however, it was the way of the time the movie was made.  I guess it's tough to compete with the voice of Julie Andrews, but looking at it from contemporary thought, I believe the combination of Hepburn's voice and acting ability would have really withstood all the criticism in not having Andrews play the role.   Hepburn's acting performance is just fantastic, and she really deserves all the praise for being one of the finest actresses in film history.  Place this performance with Roman Holiday, Sabrina, two for the road, wait until dark, breakfast at tiffanys... and you have quite the actress.  The combination of sound and picture make this a great dvd.
B000066F6H|5.0|These Scandanavian fellows know the 4 S's: the Seeds, the Sonics, the Stooges, and the Shadows of Knight. Rock and roll as it should be is properly interpreted.
B00000IL29|5.0|This is the first Herbie Hancock album I bought, and it is tied with \\"Headhunters\\" for my favorite Hancock album.  \\"Maiden Voyage\\" is a soothing concept album about the sea.  Aside from Hancock's awesome piano playing, trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and saxophonist George Coleman also give superb performances.  <BR>The title track \\"Maiden Voyage\\" starts the album with a cool feel.  When this song starts, I can almost picture the sea with cloudy skies that can only mean rain is coming.  I think Hubbard easily gives the best solo on this song, combining intensity with soothing notes.  <BR>The next track is \\"Eye of the Hurricane\\".  It is uptempo and very intense.  The best soloing on this track is done by Herbie as his piano playing seems to echo pounding rain.  I don't know if that was Herbie's intention or not, but that's what I got from it.<BR>\\"Little One\\" is a gorgeous ballad, where Herbie plays scintillating piano and the horns do a wonderful job at soloing.  Definitely a standout here.  But, this song also boasts a clever bass solo from Ron Carter that matches the atmosphere of the song very well.<BR>The album picks up again with \\"Survival of the Fittest\\".  When I listen to this song, I picture sea monsters fighting to the death.  In addition to the fiery soloing of Herbie, Freddie, and George Coleman, legendary drummer Tony Williams solos brilliantly.<BR>The album concludes masterfully with the somewhat playful \\"Dolphin Dance\\", and everybody solos on that one, but I think the best solo is done by George Coleman here, as he manipulates the atmosphere to make his ideas work, and he does that well.  Freddie and Herbie also will not let you down.<BR>I really dig this album; I think the melodies are catchy and the soloes are highly noteworthy and interesting.  But, the album as a whole is brilliant as you can imagine aspects of the see as described by the band playing the songs; it's really an amazing experience.  It's also very sedating; I can pretty much only listen tothis album on rainy days because it fits well with it.  But the remarkable musicianship on this album makes me hope for rain.
B00004SU5J|3.0|I have no idea what people see in this album..maybe i am missing something. Ok.the first track is an absolute masterpiece but from there on it all just goes down hill. All the tracks seem so generic and overdone and if you listen closely..all the melodies are totally conventional. The beats are all week and fail to arouse the slightest amount of interest in me. There is plenty of remotely catchy Jazz hooks to go round but what good are the hooks if you cannot groove to them!...this music is just to safe for my taste and i have heard more interesting stuff..try Amon Tobin...his music is pretty intense but he can capture that jazzy feel and lay it smoothly over strong head bumpin beats..also if your looking for good Jazzy house then try Rinerse or Kevin Yost..thats is some good tight stuff..You will find many songs on this CD with that latin funk base line..yeah you knwo what i am talking about!...it is so overdone!..if you still happen to like this stuff then you should definately listen to \\"Nuyorican Soul\\"..or any other productions by the \\"Masters at Work\\"..i think you will find them much more captivating... Boottom line Ludwig Navarre (a.k.a. St.Germain) is the Diana Krall of the Jazzy Electronica Scene.....decent, but nothing extraordinary. Despite all those nasty things i said i give this one 3 starts because this CD is listenable...it does not make me want to break my streao...think of it as a movi you've watch once and probably never ever will watch again...but you dint hate it either.
B000000Y2F|5.0|For five months in 1957 at the New York Five Spot Cafe, the genius Thelonious Monk Quartet included avante-garde tenor saxophone player John Coltrane.  Unfortunately, only three songs on this CD feature the Quartet.  Personally, I would have much loved to have heard more.<BR>&quot;Ruby My Dear&quot; is a classic Monk tune where Coltrane plays an amazing saxophone on both the melody and on his solo.  The genius is Monk's soloing is present in this song, as Monk simply reharmonizes the melody, adding licks with his clumsy style of playing that fits in so perfectly with his melodies.  <BR>&quot;Trinkle Tinkle&quot; is my favorite performance on this album, featuring a killer melody and rivetting solos from both Coltrane and Monk.  But, a standout here is bassist Wilbur Ware's solo.  It is a truly amazing bass solo.  When monk plays the bridge during the solo, Ware makes that work with his own solo, which is great musicianship.<BR>&quot;Off Minor&quot; is not the Quartet playing; it is Monk, Coltrane, Coleman Hawkins, and other horn players.  This song has a truly great melody with some solos that are great, but not standouts.<BR>&quot;Nutty&quot; once again features the Quartet.  The melody is one of my favorites by Monk because of its playful nature.  It does not sound like a typical Monk piece... I hear more Ellington in the melody than Monk.  The soloing is also awesome on this song.<BR>&quot;Epistrophy&quot; features the same band as &quot;Off Minor&quot;, but this is my favorite version of &quot;Epistrophy&quot; and it features a killer solo from Coltrane.<BR>The final track is obviously a filler with its 9 and a half minutes of Monk playing piano solo on one of his songs called &quot;Functional&quot;.  The melody and the soloing are both impressive on this song, but it's obvious it was just added becasue they didn't have a lot of material to really make an album of just Monk/Coltrane.<br />I recommend this album to all jazz fans.  I find it so cool when jazz geniuses play together.  Ella and Louis, Ellington and Coltrane, Bird and Diz, just to name a few.  This is your chance to experience Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane, two people who were not widely known as geniuses in 1957, but would emerge to be some of the most legendary jazzmen ever.  There may only be 3 songs where the Thelonious Monk Quartet features Coltrane on tenor sax, but in them is so much creativity and superb musicianship.

0375410341|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find so many good reviews of House of Leaves, and I particularly recommend the reviews from Mark Hansell and Steve Wood for some interesting thoughts on the whys and hows of the book. Given that so many people have worked to begin deconstructing this book (and I say begin because it's so complex that I wonder if such a deconstruction could ever be finished), what can I possibly add to the mix?<br />I've recommended this book to quite a few friends, and the reaction I most often get is a kind of waffling, will-I-like-it sort of thing. There is the perception (sometimes true) that experimental or art house books aren't approachable to the average Joe. I don't think that's necessarily true, but the fact remains that I loved House of Leaves but still can't seem to voluntarily wade my way through James Joyce's Ulysses. Does this mean that I think House of Leaves was better? Not necessarily. Ulysses was a spectacular book, but it just didn't grab me. In this case, it's a matter of taste. So what I'd like to try and do is help you decide if House of Leaves will suit your taste or not.<br />So, without further ado, here are three of the major issues that seem to have frightened off my friends. Perhaps they'll help you make a decision.<br />The Plot:<BR>If you're looking for slasher flick horror, this may not be the best choice for you. This book is subtle. It's about fear of the unknown... an obsessive type of fear. Stop for a minute and contemplate this: You're measuring out some of the rooms in your house to put in bookshelves. Only you find that, inexplicably, when you add up all of the inches inside and out, your house is larger on the inside. And every time you measure inside those rooms, they somehow get bigger. Does that give you the heebie-jeebies? If you're meeting the idea with complete skepticism and boredom, you might want to look elsewhere.<br />The Format:<BR>Many of the reviewers have made reference to the fact that some of the pages have odd formats, from a few letters on a page to upside-down writing. Is this something that ought to scare you away? Not necessarily. It's not done in an effort to be avant garde (said in obnoxious French accent in homage to Monty Python fans everywhere). The premise is that the book is written on various scraps of paper. As the manuscript runs toward its end, the writer is running out of paper, so he starts writing on every available surface. Envelopes, scraps of paper, receipts, the backs of stamps. Why? Because the guy is obsessed with his topic. Does it do anything for the story? I think it adds to that feeling of obsession. And if it doesn't work for you, it's actually a fairly short section of the book. It shouldn't interfere too much with your enjoyment.<br />The Footnotes:<BR>Do footnotes sound too academic for your taste? I should point out that a lot of the footnotes are story-related. They provide backstory on how the narrator found out about this fact or that one. As a matter of fact, the footnotes are a story all of their own. Yes, there are citations from magazine articles and books. Some are real, some are fake. If you're interested in that kind of thing, it adds another mystery to the whole book. If that kind of thing makes you yawn, you might get a little bogged down. Most of the pages have footnotes on them, and you really lose something if you skip them. But remember that this is still fiction, and the footnotes reflect that. They're far from boring.<br />To make a long story short (why didn't I say this in the first place?), my advice is not to let the format scare you off. It's different, yes, and it will likely take you a little longer to read than the average book. But if the idea of a subtly unnerving, highly original plot appeals to you, it's definitely worth the effort.<br />One final note is that this book was written in tandem with Poe's CD, Haunted. (Poe and Mark Danielewski are brother and sister.) Some of the songs on the CD echo themes and scenes found in the book, and it really adds a new dimension to check them both out at the same time. Very highly recommended.
0743216458|4.0|This is a story that tells more than just the happenings of war. It is about the individual relationships of men assigned to a particular company. You willl watch certain individuals grow both as soldiers and as human beigns. You will be let down by them when they faulter and you will share in their pride when they are victorious. It's a great read!
B00005QIPH|4.0|I recently purchased this album and found it very refreshing and upbeat.  I don't believe all music needs to be technically challenging or have a deep meaning; this is just fast and fun.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I don't listen to one type of genre when it comes to music; if I listen to something and it sticks in my mind and makes my foot start tapping without me noticing and has lyrics that touch me in some way, it becomes a mainstay in my collection. I had heard of the hype and talk about this album, but didn't really give the band a chance until recently. Moments into &quot;Is This It&quot;, the first track, my jaw dropped, I screamed out in delight, and started dancing to the beat. The rest of the tracks, although lyrically sticking to themes that many teens/ 20 year olds can relate to, have different beats, tunes, etc. that make it possible to listen to the entire album straight through and still want more.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is one of the most relateable characters in the history of film.  His good nature takes him on many adventures and eventually leads him to find happiness in the most unlikely places.  Tom Hanks is marvelous in the role, and the colorful character is complimented by Robin Wright as Jenny, Forrest's life long love, Sally Fields as Forrest's &quot;Mama&quot; who &quot;always had a way of explaining things so that I (Forrest) could understand them&quot;, and Gary Sinise as the legless Lt. Dan.<BR>  The film is even better on this 2 disc DVD set.  The special features on the second disc are in no way lacking.  Production featurettes and behind the scenes footage combined with sound design, visual effect detail (Lt. Dan's legs were quite interesting!), and screen tests were quite impressive and satisfying.  All in all, this great movie is a great addition to the DVD library and is a must have for anyones home DVD collection.
B0000062W7|5.0|Deftones are one of the few bands in the newer-metal/rock scene that actually have creativity among various other talents that add to their music. They are one of the better bands out there, for they stay true to their music and write about meaningful topics, unlike the other rock bands out there that are just looking for fame and ho's. I say that this album and adrenaline are their best works. Other bands to check out that are great like the Deftones are : System of a Down, Primus, Coal Chamber, Smashing Pumpkins, Silverchair, Led Zeppelin, and Cradle of Filth. If you like Deftones, you will not be disappointed with these other bands.
0312265859|4.0|I enjoyed the 8th book in Evanovich's series; thought that the darkening of the plot and the very real threat posed by mobster Abruzzi turned the series in a direction I'd wanted to see.<br />As usual, in my crowd, when I'm the first to finish a new Evanovich, everyone else wants to know  - \\"Who was the sex with?\\"....and I'm not telling, although it was not as well interwoven with the novel as in the past.  I see other reviewers were not that shy, and did divulge!<br />Stephanie and her sister have a new hanger-on, Albert Kloughn (pronounced \\"clown\\", naturally), and he supplied some funny moments.  I was a little tired of the \\"no bullets in the gun\\" element of the plot, and I think Evanovich should realize that this probably wouldn't happen at this stage of Steph's career as a bounty hunter.  Good use of Vinnie, Connie & the inevitable Lula in this story - even showing that Lula can experience fear.<br />A nice follow up, maybe not as good as some of the earlier work, but definitely hard to put down!
B000002MK8|5.0|Superstar Rod Stewart made this Unplugged for MTV back in Feb. of 1993 in Los Angeles. He reunites with old partner Ron Wood from the Stones; they played together with the Faces way back in the 60's. The reunion magic and sincerity show. Rod doesn't mind poking fun at his age and how long he has been performing.<br /><br />The MTV unplugged and seated was a splendid performance with an array of very talented musicians. The best thing that happened was the release as a CD, because the video was a classic, it was one of Rod's best performances.<br /><br />Here, are a great mixture of older classics including the best song on the CD, this version of \\"Maggie May.\\" Also done wonderful are \\"First Cut is the Deepest\\" and Sam Cooke's \\"Having A Party\\", an uptempo energetic, fun timepiece.<br /><br />There is lively conversation in between the songs. Slow and fast songs fill this CD. However, there aren't any lyrics or booklet.<br /><br />Stewart's raspy voice remains true, never slipping and sharply unique; he looked very primed at this historic event. If you haven't educated yourself to this master of show, do so now! ...........Rizzo
0345350499|5.0|A friend had recommended this book to me, and, although I was doubtful I would like it, I read it anyway. It took me awhile, but it was completely worth it. MOA is what turned me on to Arthurian legend- a subject of which I had no interest (or knowledge) prior to reading this book.<BR>MZB portrays characters in a realistic and fascinating fashion; multiple plots carefully weave the story of the lifetime of Morgaine (also known as Morgan le Fay), in beautiful description that also covers legendary characters (Lancelet, Merlin) and events (the quest for the Holy Grail). <BR>I recommend that you at least give it a try- if you like it in the beginning, you'll love it by the end. Oh, and you get used to lugging it around.
0920668372|1.0|I love my son. I love my son dearly. I love my son enough to establish healthy boundaries. I don't want to take this book too seriously, but I found it disturbing. Why is this guy in a twin bed as grown man anyway? Probably because his obsessive-compulsive mother was stalking him. Then, he starts the same thing with his daughter! Boy, is her future husband in for a surprise. I don't think it's a healthy message. The song just makes it creepier. I believe in loving your child, despite anything, throughout his or her life, I believe in kissing and hugging, I believe in affection.

B000005HLV|3.0|From the mid '80's to the early '90's, Black Metal began taking a dangerous turn from an artistic and sometimes humorous expression of Satanic beliefs to a dangerous orgy of church burnings and murder. At the forefront of the mayhem was...well, Mayhem. Since the late '80's, this band had been making a name for itself in the black metal underground in Norway, and here we have the result...the classic \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas,\\" featuring the deceased Oystein \\"Euronymous\\" Aarseth on guitar, his murderer and Burzum mainman Varg Vikernes on bass, and Attila Csihar on vocals. By now, everybody's aware of the controversy of this band and the history, so I'll leave that out beyond what I've already said. The music is very quintessential Norwegian black metal, wrought with blastbeats and vicious double-bass drumming, brutal guitar riffs, and incomprehensible glass-gargling vocals speaking of evil, the occult, Satanism, and whatever else they could think of to combat the status quo. Mayhem were there from the beginning, helping to spawn the scene that we have come to know and love/loathe (depends on who you are). Everything this gener of music was about is represented here on this album, making it an important album to be sure...but speaking from my own personal opinion...I don't think it's that good. Still being new to black metal, I find the music of Immortal, Darkthrone, and Emperor to be far more lyrical and musical. Mayhem were important because they started it all for the Norwegian scene, and they led the pack, but in all honesty, I think their followers did it much better. If you're a fan of genuine black metal, this is a good album for you, but if you're looking for something with a sense of musicality to it, I wouldn't recommend this, or anything by Mayhem. They're all about the brutality of black metal, which is fine. But the genre also holds many key points of beauty which are not shown here...\\"In the Nightside Eclipse\\" by Emperor was a far better album than thisas far as I'm concerned. Still...worth a listen if you're into black metal.
B000065U1N|4.0|I went to this movie expecting a rambo-esque display of guns and violence, after seeing the beautiful preview, but i was quite surprised when it emerged as a modern counterpart to full metal jacket.  The film does not focus only on the violence, but beleive me you will notice it.  At the same time much time is spent discussing the politics of the situation in \\"the Mogue\\" as well as the morality of war.  I recommend any war movie fan to buy this dvd right now.
B00005QK3B|5.0|This is it.....<br />Its not just an album it is an experience.....<br />Its not just music it is poetry.....by &quot;some obscure Scottish poet&quot;.<br />It is an album where every song becomes the next song....there is no end in the music which is not common.<br />&quot;Huddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono <BR>Wearing bracelets of smoke, naked of understanding<BR>Nicotine smears, long, long dried tears, invisible tears<BR>Safe in my own words, learning from my own words<BR>Cruel joke, cruel joke&quot;<br />It is like a year in someones life....the inredible highs and the lows..it is at times uplifting and at others very sad....<br />When I went to University I swear this album got me through it, it was like therapy....it is for anyone who appreciates music for its lyrical and emotional qualities. Its a masterpiece....thank you Fish!
B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon is becoming quite a big contender in Hollywood today.  She's appeared in several critically acclaimed films such as Cruel Intentions, Election, and Pleasantville.  And with Legally Blonde, her hot streak continues.<br />Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, the beautiful, blonde, rich valley girl who gets dumped by her boyfriend who has made the decision to become more &quot;serious&quot; and study at Law School.  After being rejected,, Elle decides to follow him to Law School to win him back.  When she gets there, she realizes he has a new girlfriend, who is played by Selma Blair (Reese's co-star in Cruel Intentions).  This sets up an amazingly fresh and bright comedy that is sure to be remembered by many people.  <br />Elle quickly becomes a very likeable character.  She stands up for what she believes in and says some of the things that we wish we could to others, but don't.  She's very much of an outcast when she arrives at Harvard and despised by most, but as the movie continues, she slowly begins winning over almost every character in the movie.<br />Legally Blonde is a very bright and smart comedy, with a hip and talented cast.  It contains great morals, a great story, and fun dialogue.  And when it's over, no matter what mood you were in before, you're guaranteed to feel better about yourself afterwards.  This movie is definitely worth a look.  <br />There are many great extras contained on the DVD, such as a Hoku music video, deleted scenes, and two featurettes.  The first featurette informs you of the process of finding the right 'blonde' for Reese, and the second informs you of how the movie actually was made.  You can't miss this.
0440539811|3.0|I know Robert Anton Wilson may believe some of what he wrote in this book, but I am sure that it is supposed to be fun, humorous, and of course-preposterous. It is of course thought provoking, and lampoons everything from Marxism to Ayn Rand. It is also very drug influenced. This is the downfall of the book for me. I think the over abundance of drugs in the book takes away from the message and value of the book. That's just me personally. Take it for what it's worth.
0553278398|5.0|When Asimov first came up with the idea for this series he was trying to model it on the fall of the ancient Roman empire, but even he never guessed at the wonderful legacy he would unleash.  Here we first meet Harry Seldon, who at this point is just a struggling mathematician.  It is also in this &quot;Prelude&quot; to the epic as it were we meet characters never before seen in the other books (although we do meet their descendants in other books).  <br />Asimov was the last of his kind there will never be another to match imagination and sear attention to detail.  This another one my essential additions to any serious Sci-fi fans itinerary.
0684833395|4.0|Although it lacks the credibility of Faulkner and Hemingway's works, Catch 22 is one of the better modern novels. It is extremely ironic and funny, and stands out as both a piece of social commentary and art. Books like this are great for people who like to read, because they easier to read than some more serious literature, but are thought provoking and artistic. I read this at the beach a couple years ago in a few days, and annoyed everyone by giggling all day.
0064407667|5.0|The book that started it all is still fresh years, tears, and more tomes later.   If there are `tweenagers out there who haven't read it yet, oh! what dreadful pleasures await.    Grownups, once they get over the fact that stories, like life, don't always have happy endings, will also find some amusement and mirth.    Snicket well establishes the resilient personalities of his young protagonists here as well as the drolly wickedness of his vile villain.    For wordplay, unflinchingly intelligent prose, and subtle, entirely anti-pedantic morality, nothing compares to this amazing little book and its siblings.   Lemony Snicket, along with J. K. Rowling, Jane Yolen,  Jon Scieszka and others, are changing the literature of youngsters, especially for this age group, and thankfully so.  A brilliant start to an incredible series.

B00000F3KL|2.0|After a boring intro, the rest of the film is one long battle scene. While the film had the potential to make a strong comment on the futility of war, it turned out to be a showcase for special effects and noisy set pieces.<br />This is a classic example of a film that favors style over substance. For die hard war movie fans.

B000002BQK|5.0|This is one out of four Mariah albums I own, and is essential to potential buyers.  It is her first main concept album and is at her peak.  Not only do we have the singles &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;My All&quot; (Both went to #1), &quot;Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;The Roof&quot; but we also have a wide range of other overlooked songs. My fav song is &quot;Outside&quot;, the album's concluding track...a magnificent number showing sorrow and loss and the feeling of always being left &quot;on the outside.&quot;  A beautiful ballad is &quot;Close My Eyes&quot;, where Mariah's vocals are at her best. It's so beautiful and emotional and will almost bring tears to your eyes.  A friend of Mariah Missy &quot;Misdamenor&quot; Elliot produced a slinky RnB tune called &quot;Babydoll&quot; which is nice and slow.  Overall if you're looking for the best Mariah album then pick this one. You will not be dissapointed.
B00000DG1R|5.0|What a fab album!  I've been into Duran Duran since 84 and my love for them is still going strong.  Their mixture of different genres of music is exceptional!  Of course their greatest hits features only the greatest but I believe the CD lacks some songs.  I was blown away by the catchy tunes \\" Is There Something I Should Know?\\" and \\" The Reflex.\\"  \\" A View To A Kill\\" was heavy with brass and mystery.  I fell in love with \\" Ordinary World\\" which just so happens to be my favorite song of theirs.  It's such a slow, romantic kinda sad ballad showing Le Bon's amazing vocal range.  \\" Save A Prayer\\" and \\" Rio\\" of course showed their pop side and \\" Hungry Like The Wolf\\" and \\" Girls On Film\\" had me dancing.  \\"Planet Earth\\" is rather mysterious and heavenly.  \\" Union Of The Snake\\" and \\" New Moon On Monday\\" truly show an amazing classic band who woo people with melodies and soulful lyrics.  \\" Wild Boys\\" was definetely what the song says, a wild infectious tune.  \\" Notorious\\", \\" I Don't Want Your Love\\", and \\" All She Wants Is\\" sparked something in my brain that made me love them even more.  The haunting lyrical lines just give you the chills ( they certainly did for me).  \\" Electric Barberella\\" is a get your groove on, dance till you drop kinda song.  From the moment you hear the first strings of notes you feel the beat in your body.  \\" Serious\\" is a serious song showing yet another side to Duran Duran.  And finally \\" Skin Trade\\" is a rather wierd song while \\" Come Undone\\" is the sweetest song I've ever heard from them.  It's soulful, romantic, and the melodies sooth you.  This album can't get all my praise but this is definetely a must have!  The musical melodies of the band and the soulful vocals of Simon Le Bon will just make you fall for the band hard because I know I did.  To me the Duran Duran fever rages on still burning bright in my heart.\\" We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside.  Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry.\\"
B000066F6H|3.0|Just how do you whip something interesting and exciting out of the same four chords and attitude already claimed by the Ramones, Cheap Trick, the Replacements etc. and, more recently, Green Day, Blink 182 etc.?  At this point, the attitude is pretty much set so it's all about arranging those four chords.  The Hives come up with a few arresting riffs (the single \\"Hate to Tell ...\\" NOT being one of them).  But the band's big buzz has more to do with riding the Strokes back-to-basics bandwagon.  Think of the Hives as the Stones to the Stroke's Beatles.  They're meaner, tougher and party heartier.  But by this time you've heard it all before.
B00003CY6M|3.0|This film tells the story of soulmates who seem destined to be together only to be torn asunder by fate. It relates the journey that each one will make alone, only to have the fates ultimately put to right what once went wrong.<br />Kate Beckinsale is positively luminous as Sara Thomas, the beautiful, young woman with whom Jonathan Trager, earnestly played by John Cusack, falls in love. They meet while Christmas shopping. The scene where they meet, however, haggling over the last pair of black, cashmere gloves in Bloomingdale's, an upscale Department Store in New York City, seems a tad too forced and contrived. Still, they end up spending a few pleasant hours together, and it seems as if they were destined for one another. The fates, however, intervene, and their paths diverge, setting each one on a separate life journey. They will, at times, unknowingly criss cross each other's paths, until they are once again reunited by the very same fates that brought about their separation.<br />Jeremy Piven gives an engaging, high energy performance in the role of Dean Kansky, Jonathan's best friend, reprising his real life relationship with John Cusack. Molly Shannon is adequate in the role of Eve, though she seems miscast. John Corbett does a star turn as Lars Hammond, Sara's fiance, a new age musician with a world wide following. The lovely Bridget Moynahan, as Jonathan's fiancee, is nothing more than a movie prop, so rotely does she play her part. Moreover, while Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack give excellent performances, the chemistry between them seems to be at the low end of the spectrum.<br />This is, however, a reasonably enjoyable, though predictable, date flick in the tradition of \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\". It should appeal to those with a penchant for light, romantic comedies.

B0000648WZ|1.0|Again, another marketing ploy. Don't misunderstand me, this is my ALL TIME fave movie. For years I was praying for a Sp. Ed., especially in light of Columbia's recent DELUXE-SUPERBIT titles, and when this was announced I nearly wet my pants! Then, later, as the 2 disc set's specs were unveiled I couldn't believe it. Just what is the point in re-issuing an exactly, and I mean EXACTLY, identical release again, just over two discs instead of one? Ok, ok...it does have a few new bits and pieces that yeah, as a Troopers fanatic, I felt were satisfying. But come on, most of us into DVD are into for the movies, not the extras. So here's me nievely wishing for a 'Directors Cut' with maybe a re-mastered DTS sound-track. But no, an identical re-issue of the first release of over 4 years ago, just repackaged. Much like the &quot;new improved&quot; washing powder on the stores shelves!? Surely technology has moved on to justify the original being remastered for home-theatres? However, one must consider the fact that this movie caused a pretty big dint in Columbia's wallet. So, rather cynically, I can only assume that this is one of their ways to have a laugh back at us, at our (quite literal) expense. In conclusion, if you're considering buying this DVD and DON'T own the first release, of course, this is THE version to buy. But if you've already got it, there really is nothing new here to justify its purchase again. This DVD should have been ripe to earn at least 4 stars. A disgraceful release Columbia should be ashamed of. A Troopers fan seriously deflated!
B00005JKGK|4.0|Well I can't really fault the movie because I love it.  It is so moving and there are so many messages about changing your life and demanding what is best for you.  I was just disappointed that there were no extra features on the DVD.
0393317552|5.0|The year was 1901 and although the ideas and impressions I will now relate will soon become \\"outdated\\" I couldn't help but be impressed by the large intelligence being demonstrated by my New Guinea guide as he found his way through some wild shrubs.<BR>Let me tell you exactly what my friend was like - His hair was shaven well back from the forehaead and his face and body painted brick red and picked out with markings in white, black and yellow.  A long nasal shell was thrust through the septum of his nose and a fine cassowary feather head-dress adorned his head.  Guantlets of plaited cane, decorated with cowrie shells and white feathers, were fastened to his arms and legs, and a bark belt fitted around his body with a white, triangular, pubic shell hanging from it.<BR>Still, I couldn't help but admire the intelligent way he could tell the correct shrub from the incorrect shrub, it was stunning really and proof to me that these people would soon take their rightful part in the white man's world and at a very high level.<BR>He asked if I might not like to enter his tribe's great house, or 'mene'.<BR>Beneath the fierce looking figure of Iriwaki, a veil of raffia-like fibres hid the interior of the mene which was about fifty feet tall at the highest point of a sharply sloping roof.  To both the right and left of the entrance, in front of shields and totems cut from canoe wood, were the skulls of pigs and crocodiles, while above the shields, rows of pigeon holes had been constructed from the midrib of sago palms.  In each of these was a human skull:  most had been painted and worked up with clay or bees-wax and given eyes of cowrie shells so they looked like hideous faces.<BR>I was again drawn to the unbelievable intelligence of my host. A couple of days ago I had given him a message written on a piece of bark to relay to my wife.  Upon his return, he had rushed off to a large group of his friends, waving the slither of wood. \\"Look what the white man has done,\\" he shouted. \\"See this wood: he made it talk! I took it up the hill and it told his woman everything. It talked!\\"<BR>Since it was his wedding day, the 'buguru' was reaching a climax and each man in the village was compelled to take my host's new wife, each making a gift of an armshell or necklace or some tobacco in return for her favors.<BR>Just then, to my horror, I realized that the great men's house, or dubu-daimo had just been completed - for such places were often dedicated with the blood of human victims, the slain bodies of which were dragged along their length.  The New Guinea natives then commenced to club spear and stab to death my entire party.<BR>At once the clothes were stripped and the heads cut off.  Braves dragged out the headless bodies and began to cut them up as women and girls rushed from their houses to carry off the cut up pieces to roast on fires for a cannibal feast.<BR>I don't know why they spared me, but I was once asked how many converts to Christianity I had made while in New Guinea, for I was a missionary, and I replied, \\"Converts?  None.  But if we can reduce the appalling infant mortality and induce them to adopt some of the rudimentary rules of sanitation; and generally make them happier and healthier natives, our work will not be in vain.\\"<BR>I didn't yet realize then, of course, that my native guide was hiding the native intelligence of Albert E. Einstein beneath his shaven and painted head!  That is until Mr. Jared Diamond revealed it a mere hundred years from now.

B000002OX5|5.0|One of the earliest concept albums, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; is also one of the greatest, probably because it never takes its being a concept album too seriously.  Although a few of the songs (&quot;Odorono&quot;, &quot;Heinz Baked Beans&quot;) play as commercial-style quickies, there's really no &quot;selling out&quot; that goes on, as their later career heights can attest.  The simple theme of the album is that of listening to wonderful Radio London, where for an hour or so the only music being played is that of the Who.  &quot;Sell Out&quot;'s brilliant songs are often segued by R.L. promos and spots for Premier Drums and Rotosound Strings, a successful attempt to capture that certain Top 40 vibe.  Wonderful stuff.  As it says in the liner notes, you could put this on constant repeat and never notice a break--and if only there had been forty songs on the album, the illusion would be perfect.  As it stands, though, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; is easily the band's greatest album, perhaps only eclipsed by &quot;Who's next&quot;.

0930289528|5.0|Comic books have always lagged behind when it came to be taken seriously by the literary medium. People just thought that comics were set to target preadolscent boys. That notion,of course, is wrong. Most people who buy their comics from specialty bookshops are in their mid 20s. You can even see some 30 something guys and those hardcore readers who saw it from the beginning in their 40s. During the 80s creators like Alan Moore and Frank Miller sought to change all that by writing masterpieces that were thought-provoking as much as they were entertaining. It is during that time, that works like the Dark Knight Returns set the pace and Moore's independent work such as From Hell and DC's Watchmen and V for Vendetta came forward. The serious cynical look of the world was forever changed by these two authors and it didn't help that they were British to boot.<br />V for Vendetta written woderfully by Moore and captured in all its glory by the dark art of David Lloyd is an example of such breakthrough work that pit graphic novels and comics into the mainstream. The piece was disturbing enoght for people everywhere and those in the media to realiaze that comics are not just where the hero turns gree or flies while bending steel with his bare hands. The main premise of the novel depicts a war ravaged Europe where freedom is lost and the individual is lost in a jungle of tatlitarian power. Moore creates believable characters and the way they all entertwine with each other just adds up to the flavor of the book. V is the protagonist. He's no one and yet he's everyone. He's the voice of the people whether the people want a voice or not. He's not here to persuade anyone, just show them what years of totalitarian conditioning could do to a person.<br />Through it all, you are swept away by Moore's intellectual dialogue and his political view which leans more to that of anarchy. In the end, the format of this literary piece doesn't impede on the story's progress, but enhances it.Moore and Lloyd create something that will sure make you want to think about teh world you are living now and how that life might change with a press of a button.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|If they had an Academy Award for most-hyped movie, this one would win. It was dull. Period. I think Ron Howard's ego finally got the better of him. <br />Looking at the trailer you probably got the impression this was a about a math genius who was working for the government and had some sort of mental disorder (at least that's what I thought). Without giving too much of the movie away, it's about a dull nerd who's lost in delusions. And I have to admit, I spent a lot of time fast forwarding, otherwise I would've ejected it. <br />There was a scene in the beginning of the movie where professors perform some pen ceremony on a prestigious faculty member: they go up one at a time and place a pen in front of him and congratulate him. This scene takes place right after a dean just told the nutso star of this bomb he wasn't doing a good job as a student. Now you know at the end of the movie the nutso's going to get pens, too. Talk about telegraphing a scene to the audience. <br />And many of the scenes were unnecessarily long...way too long. <br />In summation: long, dull story. I would only recommend buying or renting this movie if you're an insomniac. It'll cure you.

0140277447|5.0|I was really gob smacked, horrified of the Nanking massacre, it was absolutely atrocious. This book is a must. Bringing the history is very noble, worthy cause with honours. I am appalled at the denial of this massacre by the Japanese government who have not openly admitted to the atrocities, no compensation to the victims, educational system ignores Nanking. I really hope the Japanese government or leaders have the courage to say sorry in a big way before the few survivors perish. <br />I watched a Uk Tv about Unit 731, the inhuman biologial warfare where more than 10000 Chinese slaughtered + Russians and the top Japanese historian failed to mention this in any of his history books despite incredible amount of evidence from the victims put through by the British interviewer. <br />I am very proud of Iris Chang who stood up and gave a big shout for these victims, the undeniable truth of Nanking. Lets hope the sick Japanese right wingers dont have their way.

According to the terms of his father's will, he may choose not to open it but &quot;should he decide to open the envelope, it must be on the condition that he will never divulge its contents to any other living person.&quot; Adam realizes that the envelope must contain the secret that led his WWII hero father into public disgrace and dishonor.<br />He opens the envelope and begins to unravel its secrets. Suddenly he's being pursued by the KGB. The defense strategy of the USA is in danger of becoming a pawn to Russia's plan to take over. An imaginative story, building suspense, surprising plot twists and lively writing make this a page-turner.

0452282152|1.0|A book full of modern sentiments but set in the 17th Century. Instead of wasting time reading someone's perceptions of an artist living in that age, it would be much more enriching to read Vasari's \\"Lives of the Artists\\" written in the days of Michelangelo by the architect who knew Michelangelo and other artists personally. As for romance, whatever occurs in this story can hardly be called that--especially by the standards of the 17th Century. Reading a modern writer's description of the lustful fantasies of an unrestrained teenage maid in that century is a sheer waste of time.
B00005AQE8|5.0|If you're a 2pac fan or if you just want to buy a good album, this should be your first choice. This is by far his best work. I think it's even better than his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD. The tracks on this CD are amazing. He raps with depth and meaning. He is a true poet and one of the best of his time. What makes this CD even more great is the fact that it is a double CD. This is by far his best work and even if he does make a comeback, it will not exceed the greatness of this CD. This is a must buy. Also, purchase the Outlawz CD, which is the group that 2pac rolled with.
B0000019HU|4.0|There is simply no other band in rock music that sounds anything like these guys. &quot;Spiderland&quot; is a study in loud/soft dynamics and obtuse lyricism. Some highlights from this record are the opener &quot;Breadcrumb Trail&quot; which starts off quiet and builds to an amazing, heavy chorus. &quot;Washer&quot; is simply beautiful, probably one of my favorite songs of all time. &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot; (my first exposure to Slint, courtesy of the &quot;Kids&quot; soundtrack) tells a bizarro story of a sea captain washed up on a shore somewhere. In a way, this track can be seen as a miniature version of the entire album. It starts off very slow and soft, with the singer muttering some cryptic lyrics, and gradually works up to a crashing, ear-bludgeoning crescendo, with the guy screaming, &quot;I miss you!&quot; To me this record is the perfect soundtrack for those days when you are feeling especially alone and unloved. It's not relentlessly gloomy though, just honest and emotional. I only hesitated to give it five stars, because in my opinion, with only six songs, the album is simply too short to be considered &quot;perfect.&quot; Buy this. Go ahead. You won't regret it, I promise.
0385503954|5.0|Told from the perspectives of three of its protagonists, &quot;Atonement&quot; is both a family drama set on an English estate during the 1930s and a novel of World War II, with elements of postmodern fiction thrown in. Think &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; meets Iris Murdoch's &quot;The Bell&quot; (another psychological drama set in the British countryside and told from three contrasting points of view), with a twist of John Fowles's &quot;French Lieutenant's Woman&quot; at the end.<br />Because the first half of the book (about how a young girl's misperceptions and wrong-headedness ruins the lives of those she loves) is so different from the second half (about the war experiences of two of the novel's characters), some readers may feel that they are reading two radically different novels. I didn't find the dichotomy bothersome, however. Wars don't exist in a vacuum, and neither do family dramas. Instead, the tensions between the two sections graphically contrast the harsh realities of the war with the ambling, if disturbing, portrayal of familial strife. Everything ties together in the end, and the novel succeeds, I think, both as two disparate stories and as the sum of its parts.<br />McEwan is a masterful writer, but he does have an occasionally vexing tendency to get carried away with his metaphors. His account of a migraine, to cite just one example, reads, in part: &quot;Once this lazy creature moved from the peripheries to the center, then the knifing pains would obliterate all thought.... It bore her no malice, this animal, it was indifferent to her misery. It would move as a caged panther might: because it was awake, out of boredom, for the sake of movement itself, or for no reason at all, and with no awareness.&quot; I half-expected him to describe the wildcat's quivering whiskers.<br />Much attention has been paid to the \\"surprising\\" plot twists, but as the epigraph from Austen implies, McEwan is writing a character novel (as well as a book about the art of writing); he is not a mystery writer. The &quot;whodunit&quot; aspect (which I won't give away) is effectively exposed midway through the first part, and many--if not most--attentive readers will expect the revelations in the novel's epilogue by the time they finish chapter 3, in which the young girl speculates how she can use an incident she witnessed as the basis for a novel told from the perspective of three characters.<br />No novel can live up to the kind of hype this book has generated, and certainly no work of fiction will satisfy the tastes of all readers. I do think, however, that &quot;Atonement&quot; will be immensely satisfying to many readers of literary novels (and the emphasis here is on the word &quot;literary&quot;) if they ignore most of the accolades and approach the book &quot;con tabula rasa.&quot;of writing); he is not a mystery writer.

B000065U1N|5.0|Ridley Scott did a magnificent job of conveying the horror and urgency of the disastrous U.S. military mission in Somalia in 1993 in which 18 Americans were killed and 70 wounded during 16 hours of street fighting. What was supposed to be a 45-minute mission went horribly wrong when two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by Somali rockets and American ground troops were left to fend for themselves in the streets of Mogadishu.<br />Everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong: poor communications; unexpected numbers of the enemy; roadblocks; lack of food, water, and medical supplies.<br />The scope of this movie was huge and it was more a gritty and brutal documentary than a war movie. Scene by scene, hour by hour, the catastrophe was revealed to viewers. I was so glad I was watching it on DVD where I could take an occasional break from the intensity of this film. It did not glorify and romanticize war but rather gave us a view that is rarely seen and that brought the audience right into the heart of battle.<br />\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a story of incredible courage in the face of overwhelming odds. These comparatively few heroic American troops fought so mightily and so bravely---what they overcame and endured is suitably memorialized by this film.<br />...
B00003CXDD|1.0|Willow was boring and cheesy when it came out and I can't imagine anyone but the biggest Val Kilmer fan in the world ever wanting to buy this flop. One of the other reviewers compares Willow to Star Wars. HAH! Not very likely! I think Howard The Duck would be a closer comparison.
B00004U8P9|5.0|The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a phenomenon. I am going to tell you about the DVD.<br />The extras on here are really cool. The cast, the crew and especially the director take you behind the scenes on how it all came together. There is even a very funny tell-all with Susan Sarandon and Meatlaof. It seems no one knew what they were making and no one knew what a cult phenomenon it would be.<br />The menus are hysterical and the pop up video is also very funny. There are two version of the film on this set one for the American release and one for the UK The Brits are a bit freer. However, in listening to the commentary from the British actors the audience are much more intense and \\"mad\\" then they are in Europe. You want to see men in drag, toast flying through the air and people screaming at the movie? Go to a late night showing of Rocky.<br />This DVD is a good piece of history in regards to cult films in general but its worth it just to watch Barry Botswick and Tim Curry - pair it off in fish net stockings and 6 inch heals!<br />The movie is fun to put on at parties and large gatherings and you'd be surprised at how many people know the songs and dialogue. However, the theatre experience is one to be seen to be believed. You should go at least once. It is fun!
0446678430|4.0|In general, I like the way the author helps you start believing that you can do more with your life than climb the corporate ladder.  I had been interested in real estate investing, and I am even more so after reading this book.  However, I will still need to study other resources before taking the first step.<br />In addition, he refers often to network marketing businesses with going into much detail.  I have a fairly negative view of those businesses, and there wasn't enough information to help me change my perspective.<br />The bottom line, however, is that now as I drive or walk around my area, I wonder if a business might be available to purchase.  I notice apartment buildings and whether they have vacancies or not.  I wonder what sort of rents are being paid.  It has definitely made me see my world in a new light, and it has prompted me to buy additional books to read over the coming weeks.
0767814622|4.0|Why Brad Davis did not receive an Oscar nomination, I can't understand.  Well, he DID kiss another man and even though Hollywood is filled with homosexuals, the industry is very homophobic.  What a shame.  This was a glorious performance.  Likewise, Davis' bravery in the realm of homosex in \\"Querelle\\" was also ignored by the Oscars.  In that film, he went \\"all out\\" having sex with men and tongue-kissing to boot!  <br />Great acting in \\"Boys in the Band\\" was completely ignored in 1972 by the Academy, so I shouldn't be surprised at this particular snub. Women and homosex is excused, of course.<br />I recommend this film mainly because it warns people, who might break laws in other countries, NOT to take a chance.  Once you are stuck in a foreign prison, your country might not be sympathetic towards you, an American lawbreaker and embarrassment (remember, they have better things to do).<br />Americans have this notion that they are \\"special\\".  We have a warped idea of what it is being American.  People in other countries are NOT impressed by us.  We are considered the most racist country on the planet and we are embarrassed by our toothless racists that expose themselves to the world in the media.<br />This movie tells you: KEEP YOUR BUTT OUT OF TROUBLE IN A FOREIGN LAND.
B000001FS3|5.0|How can I describe to you what this album has done to my life...yes, like others,i started in '87 seeing U2 on the top of an L.A. liquor store, singing a catchy rhythm with heart...but then I discovered the Unforgettable Fire, and well, my life was never the same, you see, i was seven years old, and understood that someone else could understand what  was in my heart and my spirit, not my mind...what 7 year old do you know fully understands lyrics from the Unforgettable Fire or the Joshua Tree...I'll go far as to say The Joshua Tree dwarfs London Calling and Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band...this is a new English Language, and as much as Roger Waters and Maynard Keenan have changed our view of the English verse through music, they know, and i know, that they are chasing Bono endlessy from the Joshua...go ahead, listen to it, The Wall and Undertow come close but don't compare...all you who have studied Rand and Camus and Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky and Hemingway understand...but the rest, listen to this album...and learn life from the bottom up, if you haven't experienced it, after all, Bono's parents were Catholic and Protestant in Southern Ireland...don't doubt him, i know you will cause of recent ploys...but the Joshua Tree...I'm telling you, as a student of life, of pain, of all that is written this past 2,000 years, The Joshua Tree stands as an enigma, of life, of pain, of love...of loss, it dwarfs the bible...in how many will be influenced in the years that follow................
B0000639IJ|2.0|The life of Muhammed Ali could have made a great film.  But this attempt comes up way short for two main reasons:  1) Instead of portraying Ali in a balanced way, it attempts glorification of someone who had more than his fair share of human failings.  2) Will Smith is seriously miscast.  In the film, he doesn't look like, talk like, or act Ali.  Will Smith might be good in the role of a light-weight boxer, but it was a big mistake to think he could portray a heavy-weight.
B00003CXDG|1.0|I think it's quite possible that it was.Seriously,Tom Cruise sucks and he proved it once again with this piece of garbage.Thinking about buying this,don't waste your money.
0312265859|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Unlike the previous ones, it was not a-laugh-a-minute which I adore about the previous books. <br />I especially loved the whole Kloughn and Valerie situation. Him in the dryer is the best mental picture. <br />The dialogue is still snappy although I miss the banter between Morelli and Stephanie.<br />I wish that she gave more screen time to Ranger. YEESH!! This man does not just rate less than two pages of real action, although the buildup of tension was great. The tension between the Steph and Ranger was funny, but I hoped for more. Sigh.<br />I loved the killer Rabbit!!!! Especially, the way that Steph's mom dispatched the rabbit.<br />I disagree with the first reviewed who said that the jokes are tired. THEY AREN'T!!!! I WANT MORE CARS GOING BOOM!!!!<br />And the Bender situation was cute. <br />The snakes and spiders and bears oh my made this a wonderful book, and I can't hardly wait for book nine.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Not perfect,but still very enjoyable to me.Angelina Jolie was absolutely perfect for the part of Lara,she kicks major a**!!!Pretty exciting movie as well,I enjoyed it very much.
B00005RY7X|5.0|The main reason why this cd deserves 5 stars is because it is original in todays music scene.  The sound heard by Andrew W.K. is like no other ive heard.  If you are an Andrew W.K. fan you will appreciate this cd cause his style is constant throughout his songs.  The sound is up-beat and can lift a person up.  Andrew's hard rock style is pumped up, and his use of the piano in his songs is a new ground in music.  This is truly a great cd and i would suggest you buy it.
B000000WFU|5.0|I first became aware of Adiemus after purchasing the Pure Moods I CD (the first track of this CD, &quot;Adiemus&quot;, is track 08). Amazed at how the vocals seemed as if the whole of a small nation were singing, I purchased this CD, and Adiemus quickly became my favourite group -- of any genre of music. Potential Adiemus fans and collection builders should begin here.<br />Although all the songs feature extended phonetic vocals, the songs vary in intensity and fervor. &quot;Adiemus,&quot; &quot;In Caelum Fero,&quot; the heightening-in-crescendo &quot;Cantus Iteratus&quot; and &quot;Kayama&quot; are among the more bombastic songs. Complementing (not contrasting) these songs are the more mellow &quot;Cantus Insolitus,&quot; &quot;Amate Adea&quot; (the best song on the CD, IMO), and &quot;Hymn,&quot; the perfect 'benediction' of sorts for the collection of music. The other tracks hover in between these two distinctions.<br />If intensity is what you seek, your search ends with Adiemus. Wherever you want to go, their music will take you there -- and surely beyond.
B000002U8A|4.0|1983 was a banner year for Duran Duran.  Already making a splash with two albums crashing the Top Ten, the boys from Birmingham unleashed the enigmatically-titled \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger.\\"  While not as good as \\"Rio\\" or their self-titled debut \\"...Tiger\\" was a slight musical departure from their first two albums.  First, they ditched producer Colin Thurston and hired Alex Sadkin and Ian Little to create a sound that was vaguely avant-garde, but not too out-there to freak out the group's teenage audience.  Regardless, this album is a fine effort, warts and all.  \\"The Reflex,\\" \\"New Moon and Monday,\\" and the great \\"Union of the Snake\\" all surface here, but some of the album's stronger moments are the non-single album cuts like \\"Shadows on Your Side,\\" \\"Of Crime and Passion,\\" and the instrumental \\"Tiger Tiger.\\"  As of this writing, \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" would be the last studio album recorded under Duran Duran's original five-member lineup.  For those who are starting to build a collection of the group's material, I'd make sure this record would be one of their first purchases.
B00005QIPH|5.0|When I first heard this I didn't think much of it. I thought too much Lou Reed, too much Velvet Underground too much Iggy, too much of what came before. Then I saw them a few times on the tube and my impression changed a hundred and eighty degrees. These guys really dig what they're into and after a FEW listens to the cd I can say this stuff has a killer groove. Casablanca has an awesome voice and the band is totally spot on in their delivery. The best part is they aren't ruling the air waves (yet) and the hope they keep this crazy hybrid of whatever the heck it is flyin.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a silly film. Very silly indeed. But it's also one of the funniest films ever made. The Python's first movie, Holy Grail re-juvinated the Pythons, and they went on to do another season of their hit T.V show Monty Python's Flying Circus and the movies &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;. While their later movies are equally halarious, this one stands out beacuse of the sheer amount of gags; the black knight's battle with Arthur, king of the Britons (&quot;Come back here, i'll bite your legs off!&quot;), the coconut discussions, the almost-visit to the castle of Camelot and the classic scene where Arthur argues with a peasant: &quot;Help! Help! I'm being repressed! Come see the violence inherent in the system! Violence inherent in the system!&quot; There's the knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot;, the french tauntings to Arthur and his companion: &quot;I fart in your general direction!&quot;, and the final battle scene that's one of the most clever set-pieces put together by the Pythons. An unpretentious laugh-fest that's one of my all-time favourites. Classic comedy.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is what movie making is all about.  A story that reaches into the human sould and reveals all of the dirt and all the beauty.  It is human and that is probably the best term that I can use to describe this epic story.  One way that you can tell how good a movie is the response that it generates.  And everyone that I have talked to that has seen this movie either completly loves it or hates it.  Well I loved it and I will tell you why.  It was real.  And I don't mean the coincidences or the frogs, but the people.  The way that they had been affected by the traumas of the past and the various ways that they became victims of those traumas by trying ti sooth them.  It is a classic case of Mythology and Psycology intertwined to give the viewer an deeper look into what it is like to suffer and that the only way to move past our past is to recognize why we do what we do and then let go and move on.  It is what we are and it shows what we can be.  Once again BEAUTIFUL
B00000G3PL|4.0|This special edition box set with all the Lethal Weapons is an impressive package with some good extra material.<br />The first of the Weapon films is still the best, with Mel Gibson as the suicidal cop Martin Riggs paired up with Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) as his reluctant partner. The action is great, and while it does tend to get carried away sometimes (not helped By Richard Donner's frenetic pacing), it's still the most fun of the franchise, and one of the best action films of the 80's.<br />Mel is great in one of his first major film roles, and Glover works well with Gibson. Director Donner, who gave us Superman (1978), directed all the Weapon films, but this one is the undisputed finest. Action at it's most outrageous.<br />The second instalment is not quite as good as the first, but its still exciting frenetic fun, with some witty humour. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are the partner- in -crime duo again, and this one sees Riggs and Murtaugh joined by Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, the annoying cop who returns in parts 3 and 4. The action is as impressive as the former one, and director Richard Donner's hard- as-nails approach to the film makes it as exhilarating as it's predecessor.<br /><br />Lethal Weapon 3 and 4 are the weakest of the franchise, yet still retain soome of the cool action present in the first 2 films, with Gibson and Glover doing a \\"take the money and run\\" deal. The action is good, and in Lethal Weapon 4, Jet Li as the bad guy ups the hard-edged approach. However, the last two films aren't as much fun. The extras are good, if not great, with trailers, Featurettes, Behind-the-scenes Footage an Audio Commentary and some additional Footage.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is one of the smartest movies I have ever seen.   And one reason that I love it so much is because after piecing all of it together, it make sense.  You have to watch for every detail in the story and listen to every word spoken because clues are revealed sotto vocce.  A story about dreams of becomming great and what happens when thoughs dreams fall short.  It is stunning, sexxy and smart.  This is one of my all time favorites
0783231032|3.0|Steven Spielberg's overblown comedy is nethertheless a sporadically fun farce set during 1941. When viewed in comparison to other over-the-top comedies in the late 70s and early 80s (The Blues Brothers), it's one of the better ones, yet still dissapointingly glib considering the amount of talent on board. Dan Akroyd and John Belushi are the standout guys, making the whole messy carnage at least sometimes comic. And John William's score fits the film very well. But overall, the action is too loud, the comedy for the most part, is badly timed and goes too far. The main problem is the whole thing is based on the oh-so-wrong assumption that explosions and ferris wheels falling into the sea makes a good comedy. While it has it's moments, it's one of Spielberg's notable flubs. The extras are surprisingly good, with trailers, interviews with Steven Spielberg, Bob Gale, John Milius, Robert Zemeckis, John Williams, and and others, Steven Spielberg' behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes from the movie, storyboards and productions photographs and production notes.
B00003Q438|5.0|This movie was so wonderfully made that I believe that it is James Cameron's best.  When I fist saw this movie in the theatre it seemed incomplete.  And now I know why, because it was incomplete.  The job that they did to put the full version together is fantastic.  The effects are possibly the best done for any movie ever and it is 14 years old.  Still today I have yet to see a movie that is so wonderfully comprised.  The acting is outstanding.  I have so much resect for the cast after seeing the making of segment.  Boy did they ever go through hell.  But it was all worth it to see a finished product of superior entertainment.  Absolutly breathtaking
B000002J03|5.0|On a dusty dirt road, summer of &quot;84&quot; mind you, in a teenage boy packed rusted out beat up old &quot;78 Chevy Monte Carlo&quot;, we went to Wisconson. To our buddies &quot;parents&quot; cabin we traveled, with nothing but an 8 track player,LED ZEPPELIN 2 tape,beer,and raging hormones we listened over and over, imagining our older siblings celebrations, and our celebrations to come. We never seemed to get tired of listening to this tape, although we were always a musically critical bunch, and this was not a &quot;normal&quot; track our clan listened to then. Its a classic. I guess Neil Young is right rust never sleeps.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut.  What a flick.  It took over Two years to film and they were well spent.  It is a tale of man and women.  Sexuality and inadequacy.  Romance, intamacy, jealosy and security.  All of this is rapped up in a blanket of the underworld of sex, drugs, and whores.  It is shocking, texturally beautiful and wonderfully acted.  Tom Cruise'e best preformance.(Tied with Magnolia)  I just love Nichole Kidman's speeches as she is a true preformer and the way that you just can't move your eyes off the screen once the movie has started.  And the use of reds and camera angles and movement.  Oh yah, I almost forgot the erie piano that was reminisent of the Shining soundtrack.  I don't get the criticisms of this movie.  It is absolutly stunning with suspence and an unfolding story that never reveals where it is going until after you've been thrust through the front door and locked in.  Pure art and entertainment with insight into the husband-wife relatinship.  Great curtain call for Stanley
0451204530|2.0|The whole book was totally different than what I am used to reading. It tended to jump around a bit to much and was semi-hard to follow at times. It needed to reenstated its points more often and not throw so much information at the reading in such a short period of time.
0385121679|4.0|This is a disturbing book.  But I can honestly say that I enjoyed the movie more.  But still the book was great.  it is the unltimate set up for a horror story with a fantastic setting and the characters struggle with sanity and surroundings is epic.  It is the first Stephen King book that I have read and I was impressed with flippant aproach to the macabre.  It is truely disturbing in an enjoyable fashion.
B000062YAZ|5.0|... next to 'Divine Intervention' that is. Slayer has always been, and always will be, the reigning kings of thrash metal. But this release really seperated them from the pack. From beginning to end, 'Reign In Blood' has it all. Fast guitar work courtisy of Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. Blazing drums by the infamous Dave Lombardo (now of Grip Inc.). And Amazing vocal and bass work from the master of screams Tom Araya. <br />Reign In Blood' starts out with the infamous \\"Angel Of Death\\". \\"Angel Of Death\\" is a very strong track, and the 2nd best song on the C.D. From thn on it just keeps getting faster and faster. \\"Altar Of Sacrifice\\" jumps in with guitars that will rip you in half, and is the fourth best song on the record. Then, the best song on the whole album, \\"Criminally Insane\\". The intro to this has some of the best drum work the Dave has ever done (kind of reminds me of Kerry and Jeff on \\"Bitter Peace\\"), and then leads in to a no holds barred aray of pure anger. \\"Postmortem\\" is the fifth best song on 'Reign In Blood'. It has some great hooks and is just amazing lyrically. Then as it closes \\"Aggresive Perfector\\" comes near. The third best song on the album just rips (though it's only on the expanded version as a bonus track). The rest of the album is insane as well. This is the second greatest thrash release only to their own 'Divine Intervention'. Slayer will never die...<br />-Mc
B00004XPQL|5.0|I was surprised by some of the negative reviews here, as I found this movie refreshingly different and entertaining, in a freaky sort of way.  The thought that when it's your time, there is no escaping, is frightening enough... but imagine really knowing that it's your turn to die?  The methods used to kill the cast in this movie are quite far-fetched... some awfully unusual \\"accidents\\".  However, anyone that can watch a movie and understand that it is nothing more than a movie, can sit back and enjoy this.  If you are looking for more reality, this is not the movie for you.  Sit back, watch, and just enjoy.... then think about the theory this writer/writers had about death, and escaping death.
B000001EIA|4.0|In the early 1990's MTV did for television what the King Biscuit Flower Hour did for radio many years prior.  The formula was simple-- feature an hour's performance by a popular band, unplugged and follow it up with a release of the same material a short while later.  Like the Flower Hour before it, the unplugged series was a huge hit.  In 1996, Kiss took the stage and blew everyone away.  Armed with Ovation and Ibanez acoustic/electrics, they surpassed everyone's expectation and produced tones equivalent to their standard electric fare.  This is a really good performance that should not be missed.
0066620996|5.0|Anyone who owns a company and has people working for them will benefit greatly from reading this title and applying it to their everday life.  It contains some very powerful and useful concepts that anyone can apply.  It's well written and an easy read!
1573226521|4.0|One of the strangest books I have read in a long time, the beach is a novel that [draws] you in with a fascination like that of a vampire movie.  From the word go you know things are going to go wrong and how bad they are going to get, and you have to get there.<br />Paradise is doomed, and you know it.  You also suspect why, but it still comes with a gut...punch when it comes.<br />What can I say about this book without spoiling the read?<BR>If you saw the film - forget it.  They don't compare.<br />If you didn't see the film - don't bother.  Read the book.<BR>If you get this book you will be hooked after the first couple of chapters.  I practically guarantee this.<BR>It slows down some in the middle, but only as a pause to the latter half when the tension really picks up and [it] hits the proverbial fan.<br />It is creepy and disturbing, but I thing what this book really does best is to bring you along with it, so that you see yourself in the position of the narrator.  And that makes you ask yourself lots of hard questions.
014028009X|4.0|I first watched the movie, and then read the book because I loved the movie soooooooo much!!  And I guess it must be because I watched the movie first that I haven't enjoy the book that much, but I have to grant it that it was the preliminar idea, it is just that the movie adapted the original plot so well, that the main idea of the book had more sense.<BR>Any way, I believe this book is &quot;a must read&quot; to all women, because it makes you feel relieved about your traumas of looks, bad habits, love life, family, etc.  I believe this is a radiography of what normal women think, maybe men should read this book to understand how does our mind work, what our worries are.
B00000K2SC|3.0|This is a pretty good movie but there are a few loose ends that need to be tied. The idea of the movie was very original and brilliant.  If you watch it you will be amazed at the reallity that is behind it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavignes cd is really amazing!Her songs I can always listen 2 over and over and never get tired of.Everyone of her songs I can totally relate to and whenever im really pissed off,happy,confused I just listen 2 her music an i feel alot better knowing someone else feels the way I do.The unique thing about this cd is all of her songs are not based around guys.Most singers talk about how much they like someone,or a break up or stuff like that.Avril sings about life and her deepest feelings and thats what I love about her.Her background music is also very good because its original and from Avril.So I think this cd is with a doubt the best cd I ever bought an everyone should buy it!!
6302256615|1.0|It wasn't a good movie.  It isn't for kids.  The movie had a lot of things that didn't need to be show and played.
B000066NW0|5.0|First off, I have to say this is one of only two CDs I've ever had the pleasure of listening to in which none of the songs are bad. I guess I'll start by reviewing each track. All ratings are on a scale of 1-5, 5 being best.<br />1.\\"Losing Grip\\": This song starts off with an alluring melody and a vocal style that just sends chills up and down your spine, then seamlessly changes to a more rock style with loud guitars and heavy drums that should be played on a high volume. This song has a feel to it that very few songwriters are able to capture. I give this song a 4.3.<br />2.\\"Complicated\\":\\"Complicated\\" is a song about friends who seem to act different around everyone else. Having had friends like this before, I can feel where Avril and \\"The Matrix\\" were coming from when they wrote this song. The song is beautifully sung and the melody seems to fit in perfectly with the lyrics. To me \\"Complicated\\" has a \\"Pop-Rock\\" feel, but Avril pulls it off without a hitch. I give it a 4.7.<br />3.\\"Sk8r Boi\\": Here we have a song that starts off Punk Rock, and stays there. This has to be my favorite song on the album. The lyrics sing about the very embodiment of karma. Excellently played guitars, awesome drumming, and perfect vocals give this a perfect 5.0.<br />4.\\"I'm With You\\": This is a very emotional song. It's slow, almost feels like a lullaby with a band behind it. This is the kind of song that when you listen to it, you can't help but feel like the person in the song. Again the band is great, the vocals a crystal clear, I give this a 4.5.<br />6.\\"Mobile\\": Heres a song about being on the road, and not knowing when you're going to be back. It starts off with an acoustic guitar and quickly spoken vocals that seem to fit together better then building blocks, and then quickly changes to electric guitar and lyrics that say just what the songs about. I give it a 4.7.<br />6.\\"Unwanted\\":\\"Unwanted\\" is a song with an intoxicating rhythm and melody that pulls you in and show you a littleattitude. The band couldn't have done a better job here, and neither could Avril. We hear a song about being ignored and shut out, and it deserves a perfect 5.0.<br />7.\\"Tomorrow\\": To me this song is about the end of a long relationship that you wanna hang on to, but you know you have to. The acoustic guitar and mellow drumming really set the mood, and Avril's singing make this quite a heart-felt song. Stay away from this one if you're in a sad mood. I give \\"Tomorrow\\" a 4.5.<br />8.\\"Anything But Ordinary\\": This one is my life to a \\"T\\". I think a lot of teens feel this way, trapped in a life that's too ordinary for their liking. This song is written very well, and anyone who listens to it can get a feel of how it is to be a teen these days. The band again delivers a great performance, Avril again sings beautifully. I give this song a well-deserved 5.0.<br />9.\\"Things I'll Never Say\\": We have here a song about a situation everyone over the age of 12 has been through, a crush where your too afraid to say anything. The rhythm guitarist takes the lead in this song, and does a great job with it, but just because the rhythm is in the lead here, doesn't mean this is a slow song. Not quite as guitar driven as some of the other songs, but it will blow you away just the same. I give this one a 4.8.<br />10.\\"My World\\": This song gives you a look at a day in the life of Avril Lavigne, and a look into her past. The melody and lyrics give you the feel of franticness that is the life of a professional singer. The band of course plays great, and Avril as always sings perfectly, making this one worthy of a 4.5.<br />11.\\"Nobody's Fool\\": Here we have a song that all except for the chorus has a pretty Rap feel to it, the chorus is more rock. \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is a song about being yourself through all of the pressure your peers can put on you to change. The band as always gives us a flawless performance, seamlessly taking the song from Rap to Rock and back again, Avril of course sings wonderfully. I give it a 4.3.<br />12.\\"Too Much To Ask\\": This is a song about how some people will never show their true personality for fear it might hurt their image. It sounds to me like a slow rock song. The lyrics and melody compliment each other very well and fit together perfectly. I give it a 4.7.<br />13.\\"Naked\\": I know the name might scare some people away, but don't worry, it's just a metaphor, this is another song about a crush. \\"Naked\\" is a bit slower then \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", but it's more guitar driven. This is another song that is beautifully written, the melody just sends chills up and down your spine, and the lyrics just go right with the melody. I give it a 4.5.<br /> As for the enhanced portion of the CD, the \\"Complicated\\" video is kinda grainy, but that's what u get when u play things on computers, it doesn't freeze as expected though, unless your CD is scratched. The bio is interesting and informative. The \\"A day in the life of Avril Lavigne\\" video is interesting, but grainy. I give this a 4.0.<br /> Altogether, this is definitely an album with platinum in its sights. With a solid band, an awesome singer, and Avril's alluring writing style, and pretty good extras, this CD is a must have. I give the CD overall a 4.8 (Not an average).
0312265859|4.0|I love this series.  Living not to far from the \\"Burg\\" makes the stories ever more interesting.  This story moves along very nicely, introducing the usual cast of strange characters and car mishaps.  Just about as the story is building to a fevered pitch, it just ends.  It is almost as if the author needed to meet a deadline before she could finish the story.<br />The writing is typical; easy to read, humorous and exiting-excellent beach reading.  The story build to the end is excellent.  I just wish that there was some resolution not just a two page ending.
B000002UAR|5.0|Many have argued that \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or \\"Rubber Soul\\" are The Beatles' best albums. I would have to include \\"Revolver\\" in there as well - all three are my favorite and neither one is better than the other. <br />This is the definative album where John Lennon and Paul McCartney develop their songwriting talents into full blast. Their creativity is just blooming here - the exact ingredients that would inspire \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". Paul includes classic songs like \\"For No One\\" or \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" - perfect with strings, and even a fantastic romantic ballad such as \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\". John includes such experimental guitar songs as \\"Tomarrow Never Knows\\", \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", and \\"She Said, She Said\\" - all three sound like they were just made yesterday by a contemporary rock band. This is a marvelous masterpiece album!!! Every music scholar should have it in their collection.
B000067F7Q|4.0|The singer sounds similar to that of Napalm Death's Barney; deep yelling/growling ... vocals. Good balance of brutality with beauty like that of early In Flames. If your a fan of swedish death, look into these guys.
0452282152|4.0|I thought this was a very well-written book and I enjoyed it. I was interested in the fact that Chevalier didn't take the trouble to paint Johannes Vermeer himself in a very sympathetic light -- why, I wonder? In the book, he was neither unkind nor ungentle, but still ruthlessly absorbed with his work, often to the detriment of the people around him. Chevalier paints Vermeer as a very selfish man in spite of his quiet aura.<br />I never could decide if Griet completely realized that he viewed her at one time as just an object -- an object to paint, an object to view with a certain amount of hidden lust and the impersonal interest that lust provokes; an object to wear an earring. And in the end, it wasn't even her sweet, innocent, girl-on-the-brink of womanhood face that was the focal point of his picture of her -- it was the earring. Chevalier made me wonder if the painting shouldn't rather have been called &quot;Pearl Earring With A Girl.&quot;<br />How Chevalier managed to convey all this without making Vermeer come off as a complet b_stard (he really wasn't) is a testament to the clarity of her writing gift.<br />The end of the story was a muted and tender surprise.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|The fusion of madness and beauty might seem like an oxy-moron but this movie undoubtedly portrays the lighter side of the schizophrenic mind. Despite bordering into madness, the mind could be so beautiful to deserve such unselfish love, which Jennifer Connelly so competently depicted.<br />The movie's defining moment certainly is the Nobel acceptance scene where Nash summed up his life and his achievements into one - the love of his wife. True or not, there is no disputing that this gave the book and the movie its redeeming value. It is humanizing for the viewers to know that even in the minds of the best and the brightest, love is the great equalizer.<br />Russell Crowe's acting was credible although Tom Hanks would have been more suited for the role. Jennifer Connelly's portrayal was a pleasant surprise for me. I saw her first as a child actress in Once Upon a Time in America then in Labyrinth, Rocketeers, and later in the risque performance in Hotspot and Requiem for a Dream. She certainly came a long way from that haunting sweet face to a serious dramatic actress that she is now.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used are from my hometown of Orem, Utah and have only been together for about a year. i've only talked to them a little bit, but a couple of my friends grew up with the singer, Bert McCracken, and they consider him a true role model. These guys are so nice, and deserve everything they've gotten so far. Their live show is amazing, they give everything they've got each and every show. I recieved an advanced copy of the album about a month before it's release, and I've listened to it at least two or three dozen times, it is really good. the songs are full of emotion, great music, and thoughtful lyrics. The Used shouldn't be thought of as just another nu-metal band(i.e. Korn, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach) because they are infinately better. If you like straight-up rock and roll with lots of emotion, then you'll love this album.
6301025083|5.0|Frederico Fellini's masterwork 8 ½ is difficult to approach largely because of its reputation. Many critics also state that the film is so complex that it requires multiple viewings to understand, and this is likely to intimidate many viewers.  But the truth is that, in spite of its surrealistic flourishes, 8 ½ is more straight-forward than its reputation might lead you to believe.<br /><br />The storyline itself is very simple.  A famous director is preparing a new film, but finds himself suffering from creative block: he is obsessed by, loves, and feels unending frustration with both art and women, and his attention and ambition flies in so many different directions that he is suddenly incapable of focusing on one possibility lest he negate all others. With deadlines approaching the cast and crew descend upon him demanding information about the film--information that the director does not have because he finds himself incapable of making an artistic choice.<br /><br />What makes the film interesting is the way in which Fellini ultimately transforms the film as a whole into a commentary on the nature of creativity, art, mid-life crisis, and the battle of the sexes.  Throughout the film, the director dreams dreams, has fantasies, and recalls his childhood-and this internal life is presented on the screen with the same sense of reality as reality itself.  The staging of the various shots is unique; one is seldom aware that the characters have slipped into a dream, fantasy, or memory until one is well into the scene, and as the film progresses the lines between external life and internal thought become increasingly blurred, with Fellini giving as much (if not more) importance to fantasy as to fact.<br /><br />The performances and the cinematography are key to the film's success.  Even when the film becomes surrealistic, fantastic, the actors perform very realistically and the cinematography presents the scene in keeping with what we understand to be the reality of the characters lives and relationships.  At the same time, however, the film has a remarkably poetic quality, a visual fluidity and beauty  that transforms even the most ordinary events into something slightly tinged by a dream-like quality.  Marcello Mastroianni offers a his greatest performance here, a delicate mixture of desperation and ennui, and he is exceptionally well supported by a cast that includes Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee, and a host of other notables.<br /><br />I would encourage people not to be intimidated by the film's reputation, for its content can be quickly grasped, and when critics state the film requires repeated viewing what they actually seem to mean is that the film holds up extremely well to repeated viewing; each time it is seen, one finds more and more to enjoy and to contemplate.  Even so, I would be amiss if I did not point out that people who prefer a cinema of tidy plot lines and who dislike ambiguity or the necessity of interpreting content will probably dislike 8 ½ a great deal; if you are uncertain in your taste on these points you would do well to rent or borrow the film before making a purchase.  For all others: strongly, strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerhe characters lives and relationships.

B00005QIPH|4.0|Hype or not, this is fun music.  Among the newest artists around these guys clearly stand out.  Coldplay is in a class by themselves, but if you're looking for music besides rehashed metal rap crap or teen angst boredom or commercial puff britney, this stuff beats all the others.  Different new fresh and interesting, don't waste your time with other crap, check out something new.  Haven't bought a new release in quite some time, this one was worth it.
B000059T5O|5.0|The recent collaboration between long time veteran musicians, John Hammond and Tom Waits is guaranteed to insure grins.  Wicked Grin is unique in that John Hammond performs songs solely by producer Tom Waits.  Hammond lends a heavy blues tone to the edgy and often twisted images of Waits' lyrics.<br />Hammond, son of talent scout John Hammond has reached the milestone of singing the blues for 40 years and performing in 10,000 live shows. He has ever shown great reverence for the classic blues songs and been influenced by artists as Robert Johnson, Blind Boy Fuller, Bukka White and Son House.  In describing Hammond's many talents and abilities, Waits says \\"He has a blacksmith's rhythm and the kind of soul and precision it takes to cut diamonds or to handle snakes.\\"<br />Tom Waits, of course is a singer and song writer of repute and note.  He hails from southern California and is noted for his quirky storyteller lyrics.  His lyrics contain a dark humor and are laced with strange nightmare images.  He sings of \\"preachin' about hell and damnation,\\" \\"always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal,\\" and \\"Scarlet gave him 27 stitches in his head.\\" Waits' lyrics are filled with odd combinations of symbols and imagery found in the delta (stills, floods, mules, and cane breaks), a school playgrounds (clapping hands and ladybirds), and the seedy underside of cities( guns, knives, drifters and bourbon).<br />Hammond's voice which runs from velvet to broken glass, skilful guitar playing, impeccable timing and deep sense of the blues lend credence and meaning to the vision and harsh reality of Tom Waits lyrics.  In combination with Hammond is a fine crew of musicians whose skills add to the pleasure of listening to Wicked Grin.  Noteworthy are Augie Meyers on keyboards, Steven Hodges on percussion, Charlie Musselwhite putting in a guest appearance on the harp and Tom Waits joining in with guitar on several songs.<br />The songs themselves are wonderful. In \\"Heart Attack and Vine\\" delivered with a slow steady beat Hammond sings \\"You'll never recognize on Heart Attack and vine.\\" In \\"Clap Hands\\" Waits has introduced a strange and twisted dimension to children's playground songs. \\"Shore Leave\\" a plaintive song about a lonely sailor who has left his papers on the Ticonderoga has an exotic feel to it.  \\"Fannin Street\\" written for this cd has a country ballad feel to it.  The CD finishes with a gospel type song which Tom Waits lends his voice \\"I Know I've Been Changed.\\"<br />Thirty years ago watching sweat drip off Hammond's nose, I fell in love with blues music.  I continue to be impressed with the depth and diversity found in this musical form.  I have had the opportunity to see John Hammond on a number of occasions and have never failed to be impressed by his abilities.  This seemingly odd \\"marriage\\" between two diverse musicians is a combination which is appealing and interesting.  It works.Vine\\" delivered with a slow steady beat Hammond sings \\"You'll never recognize on Heart Attack and vine.\\" In \\"Clap Hands\\" Waits has introduced a strange and twisted dimension to children's playground songs. \\"Shore Leave\\" a plaintive song about a lonely sailor who has left his papers on the Ticonderoga has an exotic feel to it.   \\"Fannin Street\\" written for this cd has a country ballad feel to it.

B00005RFAI|4.0|When i first got this album did not see the point in her songs but then i started to realise the meaning of them. She sings about being sad and having a bad life which she streeses a lot her songs. She has amasing talent to be able to make you see what it can be like to have everything to go wrong in your life. I recommend this to people who feel down.
B000069HK2|5.0|Moving out of two years of struggle and substance abuse this band wails it's screams from Utah, and they have been heard. Thier debut self-titled cd is one of few cd's that is raw and pure to the genre, and perhaps redefines it. From the screams on &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; to the gentler side of &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot; this cd can be considered a masterpiece, and deserves to be heard by anyone with an open ear and an open mind. Nothing sounds like it, and as far as I can tell nothing ever will.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This is the first time in my life that I am willing to say that I have watched a real comic book movie. It really succeeds in capturing the spirit of the comics. Most similar movies in the past have either gone too far over the top, like The Flash, or is a good film that takes itself too seriously and tries to hide its origins, like X-Men. No as much as I love the X-Men movie there is just no comparison to this film. Spiderman treads the fine line, it never goes to far into cheese, but is proud enough of it's comic book origins to show them. Some of the angles seem like they could have been taken as stills in the comics, like when Peter smiles directly  at the camera for no reason other than that's the way the comics would do it. It also keeps dialogue that you could have seen in the comics. Lines like \\"I'm just your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman\\" are lines that make this film what it is.<br />Enough about the comics though, what is this like as a film? Put simply it rocks! The film has strong characters, good acting and some breathtaking action sequences, filled with  amazing effects. You should know the story by now, but just incase you've been locked up in a  rubber room for your whole life it is this. A high school geek named Peter Parker is on a school trip to see some spiders. The scientists proceed to show them some genetically modified spiders that have all the best points of the other spiders combined. One of these Spiders bites Peter, and this has the unexpected result of passing on these qulaities to him. He starts off using  these powers for selfish gain, by entering a wrestling match. However one day he has the  opotunity to stop a theif from escaping but he ignores it. Said thief then kills his uncle and he decides that from then on he will use his powers to fight crime. At the same time the father of Peters best friend experiments on himself to become superhuman. This has the side effect of driving him insane and he becomes the super villain The Green Goblin.<br />I would like to point out that the character development in this film is not as high as it was in X-Men, but this works in it's favour. You see it's all in the spirit of a comic book movie. The reason that a comic has such strong characters is because they are developed over years. Each  story will develop another aspect of the characters personality and then focus on the action. I felt that X-men wanted to get the most character development into the first film but this had the unfortunate side effect of causing the film to drag slightly in a few places. This is not the  case with Spiderman, they provide you with all the development needed to show how Peter changes from geek to hero, and the events that caused it. I personally feel that any-more would have spoiled the film.<br />The majority of actors in this film are first class. Toby Maguire in the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman is brilliant, managing to convincingly convey both the geek and the hero. William Daffoe was an inspired choice to play The Green Goblin. He is just over the top enough to be a comic book villain, but still knows that he doesn't need to resort to cheese for the role. As for Kirsten Dunts as Mary Jane, she's perfect. A lot of people say that she didn't have a lot to work with, but most of these are women claiming that women don't do enough in films. All I can say is that she has no super powers, so she couldn't be expected to fight green goblin could she. She was the love interest, and for her personality I'd like to add-Ladies and gentlemen my fantasy girlfriend.- The scene in the rain has nothing to do with it, honest. The only actor I will complain about is the guy who Jameson. He seems to be trying to hard to emulate  the cartoon series and as a result does not convincingly portray any emotion.<br />Finally the most important part, the action. The action in this film Rocks. The effects are  simply amazing. Even the web swinging scenes that have come under so much critisism don't look that bad. Yes they're not perfect, but I don't think it is possible to portray human movements with a computer yet, and it looks way better than the similar effects in Blade 2. The fights  with the, green Goblin are all amazing though. My fave being the first one.<br />Now while you may have noticed that this review contains a lot of praise and not much critisism. I know I've done this a few times, this time it's different. When I review a film I concider a  classic I like to be optimistic and focus on the good. This time though the film is basically perfect. Yes Jonah may be over the top, and some of the FX a little unrealistic, but a 100% perfect film will never happen. Yes there may be more intellegent films around, but as a comic book film this will not be held against it. It's not meant to be serious. I definately feel that not only is this my fave comic book movie, but it is among my fave movies in any genre.<br />Overall if your a fan of the comic, then stop whinging about organic webshooters, and go watch  this film. It's faithfull in all areas that matter, and if you like super hero movies then don't miss this film, but if you're one of those who hates super hero's and believe that all films should, be beleivable then why the hell did you just read the review, you should avoid the film.ism don't look that bad.

B00005KHL0|2.0|Well, I liked the music in it, it was really good, but, sadly, it lacks a lot of Michael Myers.  What I mean is, it doesn't show his face/mask a lot.  Plus, Michael Myers is just plain looking, Jason and Freddy are more dead and scarier than this.  But, the score was great, and the whole concept was good.  Another thing, the body count was too low!  Jason usually takes out 10 to 20 people in every one of his movies.  And plus, Michael Myers should have been played by Kane Hodder, than he would have been a lot creepier than whoever plays Myers now.  Jamie Lee Curtis was an extremely bad actor, and her voice was just too manly!  So, I'd really only recommend this because you need to watch it to understand the whole concept and because it has an excellent score, but if you understand the whole thing already (I mean, before seeing any of the movies) than do not watch this.
B00000IQC8|3.0|Actually I'd give this 3.5 stars.<BR>Midway through I was ready for it to end.<BR>My expectations were too high...after seeing Mallrats and Chasing Amy (both of which I LOVE!!!!).<br />DVD has Bonus \\"Orignal Ending\\".<BR>I don't know why they changed it...The Orignal Ending DEFINES Dark Comedy.
B000002J1M|5.0|This is simply where it all began with progressive rock - Genesis was gearing up for this with 'Nursery Cryme', and peaked out with this one - only to refine the sound on their releases in the following years when Gabriel was the lead.<br />This masterpiece fits next to masterpieces like 'Yes-Fragile' and 'Dark Side of the Moon-Pink Floyd'.  Genesis took a less commercial approach than their colleagues, however ended up being one of the biggest prog rock bands in the world with their later work.  Most fans of Genesis will remember the classic stuff that is on this CD, however I am afraid that this will fall to the mist of 'old classic stuff' that you hope your classic rock station might play once in a awhile...<br />For Genesis fans everywhere that grew up with them like I did (I am 43) - give this one a real listen if you have not already - it is classic progressive rock that all the new prog-rock bands only wish they could capture (but still do a heck of a job, mind you).  Genesis is the bar - let's not lower it any further!
0060392886|5.0|I looked forward to reading this book everyday night. It was great to be able to read it from the guys who lived it. You hear Tommy's side of the whole Pamela/jail thing, it's not what it appeared to be; there's more to Mick than he let's people know; Vince's bad luck in life, you just gotta feel bad for the guy; and the [stuff] that Nikki went through as a kid. I have new found respect for the band, especially Tommy and Nikki. A must read for all fans as well as anyone interested in the rock scene.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Tomb Raider is another video game adoption. The plot does not really follow the game, but it does have our favorite hero, Lara Croft. In this film, Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is given a mission by her father, who died. The mission is to go find two parts of a triangle that were hidden in oppsoite ends of the world. A group of men are seeking for the two parts of this triangle to open a portal (or something) of time. This could only be done during the planetry alignment which occurs every 5,000 years. Lara Croft has the key which she found hidden in a clock. Of course it was stolen. Now Lara Croft must get the key and capture the two parts of the triangle to go back through time and visit her father to get back the time that was stolen from them.<br />Tomb Raider is an action-packed adventure. It had some great action scenes and amazing stunts. Angelina Jolie is wonderful in playing Lara Croft and in adding some comedy and humor to the film. The plot was well-written and easy to follow. You will get hooked on the film from the start and you will be taken on an adventure like none other you've been before. I recommand this superior film to anyone who's into action-adventure films and any fans of the video game should not be dissapointed. If your a fan of Angelina Jolie then you should check out this film because she is outstanding in this film. I really enjoyed it and I hope you do too.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Free Bird.<BR>Simple Man.<BR>Tuesday's Gone.<br />Some of the best songs ever, with some of the best vocals and BEST DAMN ELECTRIC GUITAR.<br />Highly recommended.
0553381709|4.0|before i begin this review i would just like to warn all readers that these are not happy books. if u read fantasy to get a nice escape from reality, dont read these books. in a song of ice and fire, good people die, bad people live, the honerable are killed, and there isnt always a happy ending. <br />now that thats done.. i liked this book better than Martin's other two. there were so many twists and turns that i got dissy. the characters are deep, and i came to think of them as real people as the story continued. the plot was great, and interesting. then why the four stars?<br />during the first two hundered pages, and the last three hundred  pages i couldnt put the book down, but then there were those four hundered pages in the middle that were sooo boring. i had to force myself to read them, and even then i nearly fell asleep. luckily the whole of the book was so wonderful, that i cant give it anything less than four stars without feeling guilty about it. <br />another thing that bothers me about this series is that i have to wait two-and-a-half years for the next one to come out! what am i going to do untill then?<br />before i leave i would just like to say that if u dont like this book, it shouldn't be because 'it doesnt compare to tolkien' or any other authors out there. no, this book is not like the lord of the rings, but this is a completly different type of fantasy. if ur going to dislike this book, do so because of what it is, not because of what it isnt.<br />once again this was a great book and i loved it. enjoy
B00005ATQ8|2.0|First let me say that Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite filmmakers. Only Hitchcock, Welles, David Fincher and a few others can compare with him. But that doesn't mean that every movie he made was great (anyone see Eyes Wide Shut?). Barry Lyndon is not a great movie. It's a period piece, and it seems well researched. The costumes are great. The sets are magnificant. And the photography is beautiful. I heard somewhere that it was like watching a painting move. And that is pretty accurate. Kubrick paid very close attention to detail, and it is a very beautiful picture to watch. The problem is that the characters are one dimensional, Lord Bullingdon being the one exception. The acting is wooden. The story moves at such a slow pace. The movie feels like it goes on for hours and hours. It's hard to believe that the same guy who made A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket is the same filmmaker who made this movie. It's just plain boring. If you are a serious film student or a hard core fan of Kubrick, I'd say watch it once, just so you can say you did. Otherwise, rewatch A Clockwork Orange.
B00002E224|4.0|This movie defines so much about what I think relationships should be- Jesse and Celine don't have anything to hide because they are strangers who only have this one night.  Its terribly romantic in the classical sense... you are pulling for them the entire time, you see their chemistry, and you really start to pull for them.  This movie is a long conversation.  It has no action whatsoever... so, if you really like movies that are character driven, be sure to pick this up.  I would give this film 5 stars, but since I am reviewing the DVD version, I give it 4 because it has no extras!  When will directors go back to their most excellent films and do commentaries for them?  I have the same problem with the Singles DVD...
6304696566|5.0|The Searchers is one of the best movies Ford and Wayne made. Cinematically, it is a beautiful show (and you'll see homages to it everywhere, including Star Wars). It is one of Wayne's darker roles, and one he plays well. It's not John Wayne on the screen, it's more like he was able to find the character. Jefferey Hunter and Ward Bond do a wonderful job. My only fault with the movie is that Ford wraps it up too easily. He didn't explore the dark character Wayne played enough. But the years of searching and vengence make the trip worthwhile, even if it does end a little too 'neatly.' <br />The dvd is a bit of a dissapointment. One side is a full-screen version, and if you flip it over you can watch the wide-screen version. As with most dvds where the director and stars are dead, there is no commentary. (And I can't help but think of how great it would be to hear Ford and Wayne talk about this movie). There are some production notes that are interesting. There are 4 short 'Warner Bros. Presents' Shorts, two on one side, two on the other. They don't even touch the movie. It is a shame that there is no documentary. Ford shot seven reels of a 'Making Of', one of the first of its kind. If that had been added to this dvd, then this would be a spectacular dvd. As it is, it's still a great movie.
B000065V1V|4.0|With Heathen, Bowie brings a knowing, polished maturity to his late 60's to mid 70's style. At this point, his subtle sophistication has become quite powerful. Of course, with his maturity, we will find a lack of driving energy or flamboyant risk taking. This is a mature rocker showing why he's a master. This album will get zero airplay on commercial radio. But for dedicated Bowie fans, many of whom are almost as old as Bowie, I think most will feel Bowie has reached his pinnacle with this album.
0671027344|4.0|i would really give this book a 5 because its quite honestly the best book i've ever read (or at least most enjoyed).  it was the first time i can remember really caring about the characters or crying from a book when i wasn't doing it just because it seemed like i should be crying.  it was recommended to me by some friends who have both read and re-read it.  neither they nor i have ever been huge readers but my friends who are really into books say it isn't all that great, that its good but there is better.  <BR>the one thing in the story that did bother me (and hence why i could not give it all 5 stars) was that the narrator creates a character who seems to be extremely out of touch, even for the outcast he is.  the high school freshman boy doesn't know what masturbation his and although he is so well read he often talks like a small child, not a freshman in high school.  the second part may be on purpose as i can see some intent, but these two factors took away from charlie's believeability ever so slightly, enough to distract me at times anyways.<br />overall though it was a great book.  i borrowed it from my friends and just bought 2 copies through amazon.  one i'm going to read at least once more and give it to my friend as a present (giving the used book is part of the story) and the other i will keep until i want to read it again.
B000050XEI|5.0|In this particular CD, I liked<br />Wild Child - It just suits my personality. I thought the words were reasonably well pronounced, accept when I play it on my [disappointing] laptop speakers.<br />Only Time - I enjoyed listening to the words in this song. <br />Deora Ar Mo Chroi - I like the mood of this song. I may not speak gaelic, but I have read the translations. For some reason, it is a song that fits my mood when I feeling sad.<br />Flora's Secret - I find the song a real contrast to Deora Ar Mo Chroi. It is a happy little song.<br />Pilgrim - I liked the words to this song.<br />Lazy Days - It is an interesting song. Esp. when I am feeling lazy.<br />I cannot say I liked the rest of the songs, but I did not dislike any particular song in this CD.
B000062TU1|5.0|OK so what's wrong with watching a fairy tale even though you're well past the age of majority..... nutin .... thats what .. nuttin ... <br />I have to admit that I did expect a good film considering all the hype that I have hear but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Number one, the writing was supurb and I can see why the books have a following .... unlike most of the film being presented today the viewer does not know what the end of the movie will be after watching the first five minutes. OK so we know that Harry Potter isn't going to die but then thats about it. <br />The characters are interesting well developed and the special effects are superb if noty outright magical..... <br />Buy this DVD and Im sure you will be showing over and over with friends and family OF ALL AGES ....
B000066NW0|5.0|If you are contemplating buying the album Let go by newcomer Avril Lavigne, contemplate no more.  This is a great album start to finish!  If you aren't to familiar with Avril a great place to start is with the song &quot;My World&quot;.  This song serves as a good introduction to Avril.  We learn everything from the town she's from to previous jobs to even how long she spends washing her hair. <BR>     A song everyone can relate to would be &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;, a song about wishing you could tell that certain some one exactly how you felt.  <BR>     As for the rest of the album the lyrics are well written, and the vocals sound excellent.  It's great to have an artist who writes her own music and can play an instrument as well.  The album Let Go is a reat alternative to the ever present bubble gum pop music that is everywhere.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I can not speak for the DVD as I currently only own the VHS versions of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi.  I first saw Baraka back in the 90s in the theater in its original 70mm glory and was absolutely blown away.  <br />Years later I stumbled across Koyaanisqatsi in a now defunct Blockbuster Video store and was mesmerized.  Imagine my horror when some time later it was pulled from the shelves and taken out of print.  <br />Anyhow, to make a long story short these two films are a must-see for anyone who is into views of the world captured on film that are far from the mainstream.  Some have criticized these films for being 'cultish' or being for 'college students to watch while stoned' (both of these two views are, in my opinion, a compliment).  <br />But to me they are glorious, mesmerizing, and hypnotic.  Koyaanisqatsi takes place solely, I believe, in the United States and spends more time filming things then people.  Powaqqatsi spends more focus in other countries and spends more time concentrating on the people.<br />The blend of music and film without dialogue and without 'plot' (though there is a 'plot' but it is more thematic then it is linear) is brilliant.  I have been able to watch these repeatedly and every time I am moved in different ways and pick up things I missed on previous viewings.<br />Allow yourself the time to be still and be carried away.
B000067J1H|5.0|I am amazed by how many people completely miss the point and write this movie off as an empty excersize in narcissistic violence.  This is a complex, layered, multi faceted plot delivered in a crisp visually stunning manner.  <br />This isn't \\"just\\" a movie about guys who fight to get out their frustrations, that's like saying Jaws was about fishing.  Alongside the biting social commentary and the primal macho juice, is a parable about losing yourself in your own problems, lying to yourself for as long as you can, realizing it, and seeing the effects it has on everyone around you.  What's great is all of these pieces, a wounded romance, anti-boss revenge, triumphal combat, a devoted personality cult, can be appreciated as individual bits and scenes, but still work together to advance the story arc.  <br />Even setting aside the very original plot, the movie itself is just great to look at.  A greenish, glistening, unhealthy glow permeates the urban landscape of the film.  The pacing, presentation, acting, and foreshadowing are all perfect.<br />Loud, original, technically impressive, and fun with a mind game ending that makes you analyze the entire film again....I hope you'll take a look if you haven't already.
B00006878K|1.0|\\"King Of The Blues Guitar\\" is much better. However if I were starting my Albert King Collection I would first buy Rhino's \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" and then of equal importance I would buy Modern Blues' \\"Let's Have A Natural Ball\\" lastly I would buy MCA's \\"Door To Door\\". While there are certainly more Albert King CDs to be had, these three issues are MANDATORY!
0345350499|5.0|I've just got to the end of the novel, and I am overwhelmed. It makes a pleasent change to read a version of the Arthurian legends that does not focus so entirely on the men. Morgaine is fantastic - instead of being the evil sorceress usually portrayed, she is doing what she must to survive.<br />The novel was, and is, pivotal. It changed people's views of witchcraft, and of the whole genre. Bradley's work in this tale was exceptional.<br />Although it may be slow to begin with, it quickly becomes engrossing. Lancelet's love for Guinevere (forgive me - my mind's gone blank and I can't for the life of me remember Bradley's spelling!), and his love for Arthur. Morgaine, gifted and cursed through her religion. Mordred, no longer the evil boy who grew to kill his father, but a man, fighting to preserve his religion and his way of life - a hero, not a villain.<br />Truly this is a magnificent retelling of a classic, and should be read. I also recommend that you read The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock. It is surely to be a memorable experience
B000002H1T|5.0|When The Cars entered the music scene they were part of the New Wave music that would become the dominant music of the 80s.  However, as happens with many variations on a theme, New Wave became the New Pop as pop music realigned itself with New Wave influence.  As the 80s drew to a close, new wave began to sound like old hat, and a little dated as the newness wore off the no longer novel sound of synthesizers imitating a host of instruments with occasional sound effects.<br /><br />\\"Heartbeat City\\" was released in 1984 as pop was starting to realign itself to the influence of New Wave.  Change is not accepted well by many people, and thus this CD (read \\"album\\" as in vinyl album at the time) was not well-received by some of The Cars earliest fans, who saw it as more pop than New Wave.  However, if you take this CD and pretend it was released in 1980, it would not have been considered pop and would have been another then sort of counter-culture album.<br /><br />So when you read reviews, consider whether the writer is being objective regarding the CD or whether they are expressing their opinion of how the CD was received by the public at the time.  If you are a rebel in any era, the last thing you want to hear is that one of your icons was accepted by \\"The Establishment\\".<br /><br />Forgetting the context of when the album was released, this album is classic New Wave 80s music.  Several of the songs are instantly recognizable as pop classics that will forever be among the greatest pop songs ever recorded, albeit with the 80s New Wave flavor.<br /><br />Probably the three most readily recognizable of the songs are \\"Drive\\", which would be a great song in any era, \\"Magic\\", which also has a truly great video to go with it, and \\"You Might Think\\".<br /><br />As you move away from these well-known songs, the other songs are classic Cars, with Ric Ocasek's voice often taking the lead vocal.  Among the remaining songs, I especially like \\"It's Not the Night\\", a song about a couple where one of the two is getting ready to break up, but the other one doesn't really want it to happen.  Two great points about this song: first, the word love is not used once; second, the song doesn't mention \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" even once, thus the song could be about either.<br /><br />\\"Why Can't I have You\\" is another excellent song.  Lush vocals including an excellent harmony fully explore the unusually evocative lyrics.  Check out a couple of lines from the song:<br /><br />\\"glossy mouth taste untamed moving\\"<br />\\"your eyes like mica lethal pout hinting\\"<br /><br />Lyrics like this do not come in teen pop passages.  This music is very serious, with some of the best lyrics by any rock group.<br /><br />Enough details.  The rest of the album is Cars.  Heavy beats.  Cool lyrics.  Lots of keyboards (it WAS the 80s!).  But the guitars and drums make themselves known.  This album represents 80s music at its peak, and was a harbinger of New Wave becoming pop and pop becoming New Wave.  The music is a little dated.  It is generally instantly recognizable as 80s music.  But that is as it should be.  After all, isn't a lot of music from the 50s, 60s, and 70s readily recognizable as being from that era?  That means that this album is being recognized as one of the great representative albums from its era.<br /><br />Great rock is great forever.  As it ages, sometimes it is reinterpreted in the contect of now, but, as with fine wines, age usually enhances our ability to understand what we heard then.  Go back in time to an era when rock music was trying to find a new direction and listen to a great album by a group that helped rock music to find its new direction.y to break up, but the other one doesn't really want it to happen.

0553381709|5.0|With a complex weave of fantasy and reality, George Martin continues to write this stunning series with an amount of depth and attention to character that I can't remember seeing recently in any high fantasy series. He continues on with his brutal look at a realistic world where no man or woman is spared from the bad things in life.<br />Characters are so believeable in their creation with a heavy dose of flaws and range of emotion. The look at the world as a whole and lands outside of the main continent are terrific giving the whole tale a mighty scope that only whets your appetite for more.<br />This third book finally starts to bring in the more magical aspects of the universe with subtlety and then smacks you over the head with a couple of stunning twists. The great thing is that the magic doesn't overshadow the deadly court intrigue and human wars, but mingles with it so perfectly that it seems very natural for it to be included.<br />Unfortunately I see that the next book isn't going to be released for over a year! I don't know that I can hold out that long to find out what's going to happen next. I can't say enough positive things about this series. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys reading, not just those fantasy geeks like myself. It's a very fulfilling ride that just gets better with each page. <br />Another Great book is The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock The book has a complex weave of fantasy and reality that you will not believe
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is awesome. The music is good, if you liked Michelle Branch's &quot;the spirit room&quot; (which by the way, I LOVE) you will like this cd too. Avril is a little more upbeat than Michelle, though, but she's got some slower songs. Its the kind of cd that you can listen to without skipping to different songs. I was impressed.
0783225970|5.0|This movie is so incredibly awesome. I love it. If you don't like this movie...I can't even say it because it would be way too offensive and wouldn't be put on here, but this movie is so great and I love it. I would marry this movie if it was a really hot chick, but its not, so i cant. But yet I love this movie beyond belief....yes...beyond belief, Bye
0060974176|5.0|A very useful book that's written in a very clear way. It may seem that the content is simple, BUT IT IS NOT. This book is in my opinion a must read for any Industrial Engineer, Manager, or Supervisor working in a manufacturing environment. It can be used also for training and kaizen events.<br />Don't expect to know everything about lean manufacturing, JIT, or modern IE just by reading this book, it's more like a must do introduction to the subject(s).<br />In summary, a great book that offer a clean entrance into a new manufacturing world with a new way of thinking and doing more with less.
B0000640SA|2.0|ok dont get me wrong, this is the most brillian picture i've ever seen in my lifetime. This is beyond a doubt the most mind twisting, suspense thriller i've seen in years. The reason i gave it two was for the special edition. When i bought this i was looking forward to the special features. Then come to find out you have to take this stupid test to get to a feature.You are asked a series of questions and it just goes from one question to another basically getting you nowhere and to the point when you wish you would of bought the regular dvd.You think you get a question right and you'll get a special feature but then bam it takes you to the main menu, very pointless if you ask me. Now i know when things go too far and this is it. I got this the first day it came out and have only gotten to see 1 special feature on it. I know its probly some scheme to go along with the movie, but c'mon man too much time on your hands. I say just go ahead and get the regular version of it due to the fact of the stupid tests that are confusing as hell and its more frustrating than entertaining, great movie, bad choice for special edition
B00005JKNF|3.0|What violence is to the action/adventure film(this film is NOT that at all), dialogue is to Robert Altman's latest work, \\"Gosford Park\\".<br />Like other films by Altman, this one has it's different stories giong on at once, and a huge cast, mostly made up of unknowns.<br />Maggie Smith, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Jeremy Northam(played Mr. Big on Sex and the City) are the well knowns who play among the aristocrats.  Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, and Ryan Phillippe are among the well knowns of the servants of the aristocrats.  The strongest performances are by Smith and Mirren, who were both nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars. Maggie Smith was far more deservant of the Oscar than the winner, Jennifer Connolly.  Smith was great as the sarcastic, tactless, snob who has nothing good to say about anyone at all.<br />The story:  Lady Sylvia McCordle(Scott Thomas) and her husband, William are hosting a shooting party. The party consists of everyone sitting around talking and eating and drinking the night before the actual shooting of birds commences.  They invite family and friends of society.  Everyone brings their own servant.  It reminded a little of \\"Murder by Death\\", but it was really that funny at all.  It had it's little momments, but this is mostly a dramatic film with a plot twist of murder added to the Altman mix.  It shows the different world and goings on of both the \\"aristrocrats\\" and their \\"servants\\".<br />The acting was very well done by the entire cast. I can see that Robert Altman is trying something new here to some extent, and he did a good job. This is a decent film, but It is not one of my faves of 2001.  I thought it was far too slow, and it seemed to drag on forever.  This is long!!! Be prepared for that.  It's a fine choice if you like British whodunit type films.
B000063S6Z|1.0|Unfortunately, I must agree with part of Mr. Eminem's new lyric which berates Moby's ability to create music.  I found 18 to be quite horrible and I suppose we shall be haunted by these tracks for many months to come with car companies scrambling to scoop up the hottest pop-techno tracks.  I desperately want my money back for this CD.  Furthermore, I will not join in this pitiful jubilee of kissing Moby's behind. I honestly do not care if he is supposed to be this great DJ/Producer.  There just isn't any talent there.  The man layed some new, yet very simple monotone rhythms over old soul songs.  I like to dream of a world where music is somewhat original.  Rob Dougan has a CD coming out that is phenomenal and original.  St. Germain is original and worth buying.  Let them cast me down for my slanderous speech here, but I think Moby's glory days have long since faded into the background of American pop music.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Whether or not there is entire truth in this movie in comparision to the real life of John Nash will not sway my feelings on this movie.  Almost every movie made about &quot;true events&quot; is embellished in some way.<br />That said, I really was quite engrossed by this film.  Russell Crowe was in top acting form.  He was simply amazing!  John Nash, who I had never heard of until this movie, is a math/ecomonics wiz who is also a professor at Princeton University that has schizophrenia.  Crowe's portrayal is stunning to watch.  We see all his &quot;delusions&quot; as other characters in the film.  I thought Ed Harris', who plays the Department of Defense guy, acting was downright awesome.<br />Speaking of acting, Jennifer Connelly, who played John's wife, Alicia, was good. Although, I didn't think there was anything stunning about her performance that made her deserve an Oscar for best supporting role.<br />Even with the sad subject matter about Nash's mental health, I thought &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; was one of the best movies from 2001.  It was intriguing, and it told the story of Nash so wonderfully.  It gives you a chance to see into the mind of a schizoprehnic, and how their lives and the lives of those around them are affected.<br />Richie Cunningham has outdone all his other films, and I think he truly deserved his Oscar.<br />Russell Crowe's acting is reason enough to watch this movie.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|This movie has received a lot of hype and so a first-time viewer is bound to have high expectations.  The story concerns John Nash, a mathematical genius who also had the misfortune of being a schizophrenic.  Director Ron Howard and actor Russell Crowe attempt to get inside the head of this brilliant and complex man and at some levels, they succeed.  They show the difficulties he has making friends in his early days at Princeton, and the later effect that his condition has on his marriage.  We see him at his best when he comes up with his &quot;one original idea&quot; which catapults him from academic disgrace to academic prominence and we see him at his worst when his delusions cause him to be hospitalized and given treatment which today seems barbaric.  In spite of the brilliant acting by people with even the samllest parts, at the end of the movie, I felt somewhat empty, as if I hadn't gotten the full story, and had received only a glimmer of the truth of the man.
1558216847|5.0|I Read the previous review, but from what the other person said, there is some doubt as to the books authenticity....<br />I read the Long Walk while trekking through the gobi desert myself with Raliegh International, and a lot of what he describes can be seen out there. BUT.... i was there for three weeks, and i never saw one snake, and it seemed to be his staple diet out there...<br />Oh well i will leave the rest to speculate... BUT....<br />Give the book a read i really enjoyed it, and reading it during what was the hardest physcial challenger of my life, it helped me appriciate all i have....<br />Including my freedom in saying what i believe and not being punished for it, and for all those simple things we all take for granted... food, shelter.... hope.<br />go safe....
B00003CXI1|2.0|I am a sci fi and fantasy fan, but I found this movie rather slow and the characters not particulary engaging.  If you're a big Harry Potter fan or still young enough to imagine yourself being bundled off to wizard school it's probably a lot more engaging, but personally I'll save my DVD buying dollars for the Lord of the Rings. :)
B000002UAX|5.0|My favorite Beatles albums go as follows: Abbey Road, the White Album, Help!, and Magical Mystery Tour. Interesting combo, right?<BR>Anyway, the White Album is a really great album. Even if you aren't a Beatles fan you should own it, because it has something to please everybody (well, almost everybody!). There's \\"Helter Skelter\\" for the hard rock, \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" for the country people, and \\"Martha My Dear\\" and \\"Honey Pie\\" for those of you who enjoy that vaudeville stuff.<br />Disc One<BR>1. \\"Back in the USSR\\" This songs ok, but the Beach Boys stuff partway through starts to annoy me. Great drumming by Paul.<BR>2. \\"Dear Prudence\\" Excellent song! All the visions of nature just put beautiful pictures and relax you thoroughly. <BR>3. \\"Glass Onion\\" I don't really like this song. I think it was just written to tease the Paul is Dead followers.<BR>4. \\"Obladi Oblada\\" I like the tune of this song, but not much else.<BR>5. \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" Doesn't everyone agree that something else could have been put in this spot? Kind of a waste of space.<BR>6. \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" I like this song, until Loco Yoko comes in with her little verse. Then I turn it off.<BR>7. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" Beautiful song by George! Nothing more, nothing less.<BR>8. \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" This song is ok when you're in the mood for it. The \\"Bang Bang Shoot Shoot\\" backup singing is amusing though.<BR>9. \\"Martha My Dear\\" Is it true that Paul wrote this about his sheepdog? Just wondering.<BR>10. \\"I'm So Tired\\" This song makes me tired whenever I listen to it, so it's usually a skipover.<BR>11. \\"Blackbird\\" I love this song, although the bird noises halfway through are a bit unessecary.<BR>12. \\"Piggies\\" Ok, I guess. Kind of funny, a song about pigs.<BR>13. \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" I've listened to this maybe twice. Just doesn't catch my attention.<BR>14. \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" I don't care what anybody says, this is one of my favs on this album! The tune is just really catchy, but it gets a bit morbid towards the end...<BR>15. \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" Paul's vocal is at his best here. That's about all worthwhile.<BR>16. \\"I Will\\" Another terrific song! That's all that needs to be said.<BR>17. \\"Julia\\" Beautiful song, just beautiful. It would make a great ballet number.<BR>Disc two<BR>1. \\"Birthday\\" I had my friends sing this at my birthday party instead of \\"Happy Birthday\\", and I'll have them do it forever more. Cool song.<BR>2. \\"Yer Blues\\" Sorry, but I just don't see what's so great about this one...<BR>3. \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" Very pretty. One of the great mood swings on this album.<BR>4. \\"Everybody's Got...\\" You know the title. It's ok, but a better title would be \\"C'mon C'mon\\" considering that it's said so many times.<BR>5. \\"Sexy Sadie\\" I like this one. Nice, but you'd never guess who it's about!'<BR>6. \\"Helter Skelter\\" Well...what to say about this that hasn't already been said? I like it, but...you decide.The best part is \\"I GOT BLISTERS ON MY FINGERS!!!!\\"<BR>7. \\"Long,Long,Long\\" This one's ok, but the ending gets better.<BR>8. \\"Revolution 1\\" I prefer the fast version on Past Masters 2.<BR>9. \\"Honey Pie\\" I flat out don't like this one. Enough said.<BR>10. \\"Savoy Truffle\\" Choclatey song! It makes me hungry.<BR>11. \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" Kind of haunting, don't you think? A seance in the dark...<BR>12. \\"Revolution 9\\" I've got nothing to say, but it's ok!<BR>13. \\"Goodnight\\" Very pretty song. Listen to it while you're trying to sleep!<BR>There you have it. My opinion on the White Album. I highly recommend it!
B000002MY3|5.0|I can insert a corny Alanis pun here e.g. You Oughta Know why this album is so good (oops I did it anyway), but if have not listened to it, please do yourself a favour. Despite the occasional weird analogies that just add a touch of quirkiness, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is a complete package: in depth lyrics, creative melodies, and music that draws in fans from all genres. I can see an episode of VH1's &quot;Ultimate Albums&quot; in the works now.<br />Alanis shines in her thoughtful, more mellow moments such as &quot;Perfect&quot;, which is about parents pushing their kids too hard, &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;, &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;, the closest thing to a love song, and the sweet, depressingly uplifting &quot;Mary Jane&quot;. She radiates on the other end of the spectrum on more energetic, wisdom enriched and sometimes even angry tracks like the big hits &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;Not the Doctor&quot; and &quot;Wake Up&quot;.<br />Do not forget the hidden acapella track at the end of track 13. I don't know the title but it goes &quot;Would you forgive me, love, if I staed all afternoon?&quot; and so on. It is up to par with the other songs and could have been a regular track. To sum it all up, I'll insert another cheesy Alanis pun: If you've got one hand in your pocket, it should be getting the money to buy this album! Ha, ha. Okay, it's not funny.
B00005JL3A|3.0|what can i really say? i had attempted to follow the progress of the rumored resident evil movie since shortly after the release of resident evil 2. three long years. three long years can kind of force anyone to expect a lot. though the move really had its strong points, it just seemed to lack plot; maybe it is just common among all survival movies. anyway, despite the great performances by milla jovovich (hope i spelled it right), michelle rodriquiz (again... same hope), and eric mabius, the movie just kind of lacked.<br />it only left me wondering one thing: where was the magnum/colt python?
B00005JL3A|5.0|RE movie is the most impressing title of the year!!!<BR>Is to fantastic as the videogame!!! Buy it!
B00005QIPH|2.0|Is this it? Is the appropriately named debut Album from the strokes. Appropriate, because after all the hype you would have expected something a bit more invigorating really.<br />Look up television, Iggy pop, gang of four, Richard Hell and the velevet underground because the strokes rip off all of the afore mentioned bands while adding a bit more production to make it more accessible to today's music consumer.<br />How can any self respecting punk rock band form after meeting at boarding school in Switzerland? Punk rock and wealth just don't make sense and the bands mentioned earlier thrived on being outsiders and creating music that came from the pain and suffering experienced as a result. No, the strokes are punk rock for the new millennium. A well packaged, well produced group that will sell millions but will never be as good as the original.

0312265859|3.0|While I enjoyed this book I have to say that I was a little disappointed with it.  The jokes and situations are starting to get a little stale and everyone feels like they are running in place.  The story needs to move on.<br />Now, having said all that, I still enjoyed the book and will be looking forward to the next one.
0790732254|5.0|What is most striking about this work is how well it has stood the test of time, and how what was shocking forty years ago is now part of the national psyche. Here is Elizabeth Taylor at the height of her physical beauty, putting on a firght wig, and getting overweight to play -- no to overplay -- the boozy Martha to perfection. Richard Burton, the godfather of Anthony Hopkins and Russell Crowe, is the perfect foil to Taylor (or is he?) in this hall of mirrors, dark comedy. Ultimately it is a love story, with an oddly happy ending. Albee has shown himself to be our greatest working playright (Arthur Miller is still alive, and hasn't worked much lately). Compare this to Three Tall Women and we see an exploration of how the self can be broken into many people. Compare this to The Goat and we see how many people become incorporated into the self.
0060926317|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read!  The amazing adventure experienced by the main character makes one question of one perceptions of what our universe is and has also given me a new respect for the incredible aborigines and their beliefs and knowledge of the world.
B000060MY6|2.0|I don't usually review movies, but I feel so strongly about this movie that I thought I'd make it an exception.  The only reason it gets two stars is because the first hour or so is very interesting.  There are several seemingly unconnected scenes, and as the movie progresses you discover, somewhat, how they are connected.  I kept watching because I wanted to find out what the explanation would be for all the weird things that were happening.  For example, there's a guy who (I think) dies of a heart attack after seeing a horrible man he thought existed only in his dreams.  There's weird movie politics involving a director who's being forced to cast a certain woman as the lead in his movie.  There's the main plot thread (or at least I consider it the main one) involving Betty and Rita.  Rita got into a car accident, can't remember who she is, and has a ton of money and a strange key in her purse.  Then there are all the countless other strange details in the movie, all of which kept me interested.<br />Unfortunately, all this buildup leads only more confusion.  This movie is an English teacher's dream.  I'm sure it's possible to come up with countless interpretations of what actually was going on.  However, I only ended up feeling betrayed by the creators of this movie.  It's like they knew what was going on, but decided it would be funny to only hint at it for the audience.  I was expecting things to start making sense, and I guess I was expecting too much.
0380713802|5.0|This book was a riot!  I found myself laughing out loud and desperate to read aloud passages to anyone nearby.  I highly recommend this book.

B000065U1N|5.0|I was told by a bunch of people that Black Hawk Down was no good.  A few days ago I bought the DVD and boy how wrong they were.  First of all, war is my favorite genre in movies.  BHD is now my favorite war movie (my second being Saving Private Ryan.)  There is so much action and thrills to this movie.  All of the cast is great including Tom Sizemore who was also in SPR.  What made it even more great was the use of all the real ARMY blackhawks and little bird helicopters and all the other vehicles that the ARMY provided to make this movie as real as possible.  This movie has been directed to a very high level of excellence.  I heard that people that were actually in this eventin 1993 said that this movie has captured the truth extremely accurate.  I rate this movie as my second favorite movie of 2001 right under my first of LOTR.  This is a movie that you can watch one day and the next day and the next as I did.  It IS just that great.  I suggest, no I am telling you that you should buy this movie or at least rent then buy it!
0312265859|5.0|I loved this book. My only critisism is it wasn't long enough.  I spend all year waiting and finished it in 6 hours. Last year I was dissapointed with 7 up. Sometimes Janet leaves you with cliff hangers that do not pay off and it makes you feel like a chump. <br />This book was great. The new charactors were fun and the old favorites that returned were great.<br />I loved the geese and the scene when her car was stolen had me laughing so hard that I was holding my sides.<br />It is a like a breath of fresh air to read Janets books. There are many wanna be's out there, but none are her equal. Hurry up with Nine Janet as well as 10, 11, 12.....
B00005QDW5|1.0|First of all, if your not a Barret fan, you should just skip reading this review. If you are a Barret fan, however.......<br />My biggest complaint about the release of an album like this is that it displayes plainly the fact that both the Floyd and the record companies have their priorities highly confused, shall we say. What they should have done, and what some people have been waiting for for 35 years, is come out with a compilation of UNRELEASED Floyd material from the Barret era, of which there is a great plenty. In my mind, at least, it makes more sense to provide people with the oportunity to here songs that many Floyd fans dont even know exist, rather than slap togeather &quot;hit&quot; songs that everyone has already heard before anyway. I myself have most of the unreleased Barret material-mostly from bootleged copies- its hard to find but it IS out there(go to ebay and look around). There is easily a full albums' worth of unreleased Barret stuff. It is sad to know that the record companies and David Gilmore are more concerned with making even more MONEY rather than providing the avid Pink Floyd the opportunity just to here more of their wonderful music.<BR>In closing, its offensive that great songs from &quot;Dark Side&quot;(Breathe, Brain Damage, Eclipse)were substituted for mediocre ones from mediocre albums(the fletcher memorial home???come on).
B000002MP2|5.0|This is probably the best CD in the world. It is fast, energetic, catchy, with smart lyrics, amazing bass, guitar, drums, and great vocals. All of the songs on this CD could be a single, so there aren't a lot of songs that you would skip over.<br />(1)BURNOUT...5/5...Great way to start out the CD. It has good lyrics, and great drum solos. It's kinda short though, but still a great song.<br />(2)HAVING A BLAST...5/5...Another incredible song. When it says having a \\"blast\\", it really means a blast. The song is about a guy with explosives tied to himself which he's going to set off killing himself and other people. Not the best topic for a song, but still one of the best.<br />(3)CHUMP...3.5/5...This song is okay, it's just that towards the end it's just about a minute of music which leads into the next song. It's a really good song but then it gets lost when the music comes in.<br />(4)LONGVIEW...4/5...The first single off of Dookie. It has really good bass and a powerful chorus.<br />(5)WELCOME TO PARADISE...4/5...This is also on Kerplunk, although I think this version is better. Really cool song and great music.<br />(6)PULLING TEETH...3/5...I don't like this song because it sounds like a country song. This is the only song that I skip over when i listen to the CD.<br />(7)BASKET CASE...5/5...THE BEST SONG ON THE CD! Best guitar and drums and is very energetic and catchy. One of my favorite songs of all time. If you hear this song i gaurentee you'll want to buy this CD.<br />(8)SHE...4.5/5...Amazing bass in the beginning of the song. It's a really great song and has great music.<br />(9)SASSAFRAS ROOTS...4/5...Pretty good song, just not one of the best. Just O.K.<br />(10)WHEN I COME AROUND...4/5...Great song, another single from the CD. Cool guitar and great lyrics, although there a little hard to understand.<br />(11)COMING CLEAN...5/5...This is where the energy comes in. Nice and fast, although pretty short. Powerful guitar, and great drumming. Cool lyrics too.<br />(12)EMENIUS SLEEPUS...4.5/5...Another energetic, pretty fast song. The lyrics are kind of funny, and they're very catchy.<br />(13)IN THE END...3.5/5...Very fast and energetic. It isn't a very good song though.<br />(14)F.O.D....4/5...You'll figure this out after listening to the song, but F.O.D. stands for f*:% off and die. It starts out slow, but then explodes into energetic, fast music. Has a hidden track.<br />BUY THIS CD!!!! END OF STORY
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man is the best comicbook hero adaptation I have ever seen on the big screen. The special effects used while the web slinger was swinging through New York where amazing. Besides the outstanding effects Spider-Man also had fantastic character developement and a script that actually told the story of Peter Parker.
B00005R87Q|3.0|THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a movie with an assortment of far-fetched ingerdients that combine to make up a far-fetched plot.  It offers beautiful cars and obnoxious characters who combine for some impressive racing / getaway / highway-jacking scenes.<br />In the end, however, there is one genuinely worthwhile reason to see this movie:  Vin Diesel.  This is the first movie I've seen him in and I was quite taken with his acting style.  He has an exceptional screen-presence, especially for a relative newcomer to the acting guild.  The jury is still out on whether Diesel can play more than just a tough-guy, but even if he can't, he still plays that role very well.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in TRIPLE-X.<br />Beyond Diesel's theatrical performance, the film does not offer a whole lot.  The &quot;hero&quot; of the movie is a cop who is less likeable than the &quot;villain&quot; (played by Diesel).  He also non-chalantly breaks the #1 rule in a policeman's code-of-conduct:  never EVER commit an crime with the efficacy of enforcing a law.  But oh, well, this is Hollywood.<br />If you want a far superior movie in the fast car genre, I would recommend GONE IN 60 SECONDS.  To me, it was far more satisfying than this one.
B00005QXDD|5.0|WOW! Best CD ever! It's always on, a must buy!
B00005JKQZ|1.0|I heard that this was a great movie, so I decided to rent it.  I was very disappointed with the movie.  Most of the time, I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't.  I definitely would not recomment this movie to anyone.
0790729725|5.0|There is only one thing to say about this film : Exelant! ! !<BR>I remember watching this film when babysitting, and after the first half hour, i was shocked at its brilliance!!! when it got to 2 hours i didnt want it to end!!! It totally beats the ... out of The Godfather trilogy..........and thats saying something;<BR>So if you havnt seen this movie, i suggest you buy it.... I hardly think you'll be dissopointed.<br />But as for the DVD...IT ...! \\"YOU WOULD EXPECT A LITTLE MORE OF A DVD FOR THIS IMPORTANCE AS IT IS IN THE TOP 10 HUNDRED GREATEST FILMS!!! ALL YOU GET IS TWO TRAILERS, AND A LITTLE INFO ON HOW THE MOVIE GOT ACADEMY AWARDS, OSCORSAND STUFF\\"! THEY SHOULD BE A BOX SET FOR THIS AMAZING WORK\\"!<br />DON'T BUY ANY OTHER MOVIE THAN THIS IF YOUR GOING TO GET ONE FOR YOUR COLLECTION!
B000050XEI|3.0|This is pretty nice.  But after awhile, it's all the same- feel/ type of song.  I can't listen to the whole thing at once for that reason, in a way it becomes monotonous.  But the songs themselves can be good.  &quot;Only Time&quot; can have a bewitching effect of being in love (with the song) on you.  <br />My favorite line: &quot;Who can say when the day sleeps/ if the night keeps all your heart&quot;  <br />Also, in the lyric book of this album, the pictures of Enya looks to me kind of like Winona Ryder.
B000002WUD|2.0|95% of this box set will make a true rock n' roller cringe. RCA should have combined the handful of good '70s singles with some live staples on one CD instead. That's all anyone would ever need of EP in the '70s. I sold this set to a record shop a week after I bought it. I love Elvis to death. But this is garbage, worse than the trash from the movies. At this point in his career, Elvis was literally dying from his pill addiction. He's high on stage and the Colonel gives him more crap to record in the studio. Save yourself from being embarrassed for your idol. All you need is the Complete '50s Masters Set, TigerMan, Memories:The Comeback Special, Suspicious Minds:The 1969 Memphis Sessions and download the good stuff from the early '60s and '70s. Remember Elvis for his greatness, this collection is just plain depressing.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Dario Argentos Suspiria is always listed in the top ten of the best horror films ever made.Through directors use of sound color and twisted camera angles we are drawn into the web of dark magic and secrets.The pulse pounding score by Goblin is killer this is a movie that should be watched with the sound way up and the lights off !
0767817478|4.0|I'd like to clear something up for those viewers who haven't seen the 1998 version of the Japanese cult-classic monster movie Godzilla: This isn't the Toho version nor' is this Citizen Kane material. Godzilla is a popcorn movie, from beginning to end. Those who analyze this film for Oscar-winning performances are missing the point.  <br />I do agree that the human actors (With the exception of Jean Reno, who always makes things better...) are absolutely horrible, and I do wish the storyline hadn't even bothered with the cringe-inducing love interest between Broderick and Pitillo, but you didn't walk into this movie to see the humans. Instead, you entered the theater to see a big lizard terrorize the big apple an leave it in shambles. By tuning-out the humans and concentrating solely on Godzilla, that is exactly what I got, and if people would do the same, they too would find satisfaction.
B000060P79|5.0|I first heard of Simple Plan when I bought my MTV TRL Christmas CD. Their song, &quot;My Christmas List&quot; was really awesome. It sounded great and the lyrics were cool, funny, and catchy. I looked on the net for information on the band but I couldn't find any. But finally, a few months later I saw the video for Simple Plan's single, &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot;. I knew that I would have to get their CD. I got the CD right away and I can say that I've been really happy with it. Punk is my favorite music and Simple Plan is an awesome punk band. SP's music definently has to be some of the best pop/punk music I have ever heard. Every song on the CD is good. I've listened to this CD A LOT but I'm still not bored of it. I could easily listen to this CD the whole way through. I couldn't pick a favorite song off the CD but I can promise that every single one is awesome. I have three words left to say: Go buy it!
B00006690G|4.0|When I first picked up the cd, i thought that it was definetly a five-star album, but the question remain whether The Eminem Show could surpass it's predecessor, The Marshall Mathers LP. From the viewpoint of individual songs, yes it is probably slightly better than MMLP. However, from an artistic view, the storytelling and the battles between good and evil are absent. EmS is missing a Stan. Em's separate personalities (Eminem, Slim Shady, and Marsall Mathers) are kept separate and rarely inteact in the same way they did on such masterpieces as Kim and others from the last album. Also the storytelling Eminem that could cleverly put together a story about a crazy fan is replaced by an autobiographical Em that, I don't know about everyone else, I can't relate to at any length. In the end The Eminem Show is great album and I recommend picking it up, but is just short of reaching the classic status attained by The Marshall Mathers LP.
B00005Y228|5.0|Love At First Sight, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, In Your Eyes, Dancefloor, and Your Love are some of the BEST dance recordings I have ever heard. Kylie's music is a devastatingly catchy. She weaves her voice through the fabric of infectious rhythms that are just mind-boggling. I cannot believe her success has not translated well into America, but at least she is getting the recognition she deserves. Fever is a really solid album, perhaps the best British teen-pop import since that infamous 5-some in 1997. Although not the most lyrically compelling nor the most original, Fever is, nonetheless, worth your money - I guarantee, you'll like it.....
B00003W8NM|5.0|I didn't get to see this in the theatre but all my friends would tell me is &quot;you'll like it, it's your kind of movie.&quot;LIKED IT????? I was blown away. I won't say anything about the ending except that i had no idea that this was the outcome of all outcomes.  It was scary, terrifing, troubling, funny, sensative and basically the same emotions that is held in each one of us. Way-out, far-fetched or was it? Did it hit a nerve? Could this be me? Basically i bought this movie because i'm a big Ed Norton fan. He's the finest that Hollywood has but at the end of the film every emotion that i have ran thru my body  in a scary-funny kind of way.  Fight Club is raw and real. The acting is the best. The extra information that are on the disks is the best. This DVD will really show you the benefits of what this DVD technology has to offer. An award should be given to this DVD on merit alone.  It's a real mans movie even though many women like it as well. Buy it,,,,you will not be disappointed just don't expect Mary Poppins.  Clue-----the fighting IS the minor (however important) part of this film. (ha!)
B00005QIPH|5.0|All these haters are bashing this album, I don't think they get it.  This is for review purposes, not to rant for being out on money.<br />Simply put.  Buy this album for these reasons:<BR>1. You want something to drive to.<BR>2. You want music that makes you tap your toes.<BR>3. You want to listen to music that makes you feel like having a good time.<br />DO NOT Buy this album if:<BR>1. You need your music to be complicated and progressive.<BR>2. You need your music to make you stroke your bushy beard thinking of the sad ... lyrics involved.<BR>3. You need your music to prove to your friends that you are smart.<br />It doesn't get any easier than that.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I am not one for special effects.  Actually i hate them. After working at Radio City Music Hall and seeing special effects done live and seeing real entertainment special effects in movies is worthless and is usually a cover-up for poor acting and untalanted actors.  But i digress. Every-so-often there is an acception and this film is it. It's wonderful! Pure enjoyment! Fun &amp; exciting, following as close to the book as i've ever seen. A perfect addition to my collection of DVD's.  Please make it your also.

B00005QDW1|1.0|OK, up to the minute I stuck this CD in my car stereo on the way home from the mall the day it came out, I considered myself the biggest NoDoubt fan on the planet.  Gwen was my idol, Aaron the guy I wanted as my best pal, but I was confused. Track one rolled and I hated it, where was all the real music? The guitar licks I needed to learn how to play? I kept going through the CD skipping song after song.  I am appalled that No Doubt has become so over processed and...I cant even think of a strong enough word.  you sold out gwen. Buy Return off Saturn for the lyrics with meaning and the awesome MUSIC! dont waste your money and smash your ideas of the band.
B00005K3NY|5.0|The first time I saw Scanners,I was 4 or 5 years old.And,the first scene that I saw was that dude's head exploding clear off his shoulders.And,since then I've been hearing so much about that scene,to where I watched it on TV and the first thing I see is that exact scene,and I think, &quot;So,that's the part everyone's been talking about!&quot;Other than that scene,the film is kinda pointless.
0312265859|5.0|I think that some of the previous books were funnier but this was very enjoyable.  When I find myself laughing hysterically out loud this is definately a good book and a great author.

B000001GQY|5.0|Emil Gilels is one of my favorite pianists.  I first heard him when I bought his recording of the five Beethoven Concertos with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra with my 16th birthday money.  Then I was lucky enough to hear him perform a largely Mozart concert in Hill Auditorium here in Ann Arbor when I was still in high school.  He is always intelligent, strong, with great tonal colors, and poetic with fabulous technique.<br />Brahms is also one of those great composers that do everything I want in music.  Here we have a concerto from his youth and another from his maturity.  They are both clearly Brahms and though they are similar in length they are very different pieces of music.  The younger Brahms is more narrative and much more extravagant in his musical material than the mature Brahms.  While I love both styles it is the mature style that I find more compelling.<br />These recordings are great.  The slow movements in both concertos show Gilels' greatness.  He takes chances and holds the lines out to the last possible moment without letting anything slip away.  Just magnificent.  The slow movement in the second concerto is simply irresistible.<br />Gilels never bangs but has the power to push the piano to its utter limits.  You can here the distortions in the strings as they are pushed to their limits.  (I wonder if he broke strings during the recording sessions.)  This big powerful sound makes the delicacy of the slow movements all the more amazing.  Gilels is able to battle the full orchestra and still make the most evanescent sounds.<br />The opus 116 pieces are in Brahms' mature style and are simply wonderful pieces and played here with great intelligence and intimacy.  You owe it to yourself to hear these disks.
B00005UW7V|1.0|This is the first movie that I have ever walked out on. After the second hour past I couldn't believe that the movie was still continuing with what seemed to be another subplot. The movie moved very slow and didn't fit together very well. It was a very disappointing night at the movies for me.
B000066C1N|4.0|Anyone who loves the Rockies, Yellowstone, and the canyonlands of the southwest, will love the wild spirit of this music.  Hans Zimmer has this way of relocating us in our imaginations to wild places we have never seen,long for, or miss. Bryan Adams collaborates with this master of movie music quite well ( I have missed him on the airwaves!) My kids (5 and 9) loved the movie and now love the music that goes with it. This one goes with the &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (John Barry) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; collections.
B000002OCP|1.0|From the new Muddy Waters biography, CAN'T BE SATISFIED, I quote from Muddy himself (page 207, second paragraph):  &quot;That Electric Mud record I did, that one was dogs--t.  But when it first came out, it started selling like wild, and then they started sending them back.  They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this s--t going on--all this wow-wow and fuzztone.&quot;<br />I agree.

0446608955|5.0|SORRY IF ANYONE ALREADY SAID THIS: sorry to spoil it for the people who havent read it yet but this is wat i think ..... i think that this was such a romantic and spiritual book and as much as i love shane west in the movie and mandy moore was great, the book is MOST DEFINITELY better. i mean in the book, landon mentions that the &quot;walk to remember&quot; was when jamie mustered all the little strength she had and walked down the aisle with her father rite? well in the movie she walked normally just smiling prettyful. but landon's whole coming of age is very inspiring and it kinda made me think twice about my faith friends family love and life. but yea i read it every sleepless night cause this is the book that makes me cry to sleep.
0060930187|4.0|I liked this novel. Not necessarily entirely credible from the psychological point of view, because the transition from ambitious college girl to depressed, blase poet isn't written all too well. What was done very, *very* well, though, was the language. The descriptions, analogies, and metaphors used were very beautiful and poetic. Very real in that sense...
B000065V1V|4.0|This album is a lot different than his work as of late.  Albums like Earthling seemed to focus on Bowie's ability to sound like a millenium man. That album was missing the feeling of a real band, all you heard were big beats and synthisizors.  With this new album, you can hear the instruments, and feel the beat at the same time.  This is a great combination of band and big beat techno.  <br />The other great thing about this album is how moody it is.  It is a laid back vibe, especially on the first track &quot;Sunday.&quot;  My personal favorites for this are &quot; I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship,&quot; &quot;I Would Be Your Slave,&quot; and &quot;Cactus.&quot;

6304493681|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT movie. The scenes are so vivid, and the storylines are amazing. The animation is great, and the movie itself even creeped me out at some points because of how deep the plot was. I reccoment this movie to everyone,  even to people who don't like animation that much. You forget its animated after a while. You get lost in the plot. It's deffinately worth your time and money to watch.
B0000039QA|5.0|Ready To Die only gave us a hit of the musicial bong that is Life After Death!! B.I.G comes back witha slick dose of revelation after achieving the success wished in his first record.Unfortunately, this is the last great Biggie and Bad Boy album.
B000002L7Y|5.0|I have never heard a more beautiful, moody and touching ballad such as &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;. It just blows me away. Beautiful vocals, and beautiful melodies.
B000059WOD|5.0|This is the best rock cd you will ever see for a long time. everysong is amazing (except cure for the itch wich i dont really get)if you like rock and rap u will luv dis album. I cant tell you the best song on the album because they are all good. Buy this album, its worth it , beleive me ull be hooked to it.
B00005Y228|1.0|Kylie Minogue has no problem blending in with America's pop scene, simply shaking her can and taking her clothes off for money (yes, I am implying that).  Granted, that can be appropriate for an 'artistic vision' (re: Fiona Apple's \\"Criminal\\" video), but mixed with provocative dancing, her music gives as brief a payoff as a strip joint.  Her music, though good for the first few listens, melts into pop drivel, as if the CD itself was made of ice.  She also adds to misrepresentation of the electronic music scene, by simply taking rock and putting in synths instead of guitars (re: Prodigy's \\"Fat of the Land\\").  Basically, don't waste your money.
B0000039PW|5.0|I compare this album to Life After Death like you would compare Prince's Purple Rain to Sign O'The Times. This is only a foreshadowing of what's to come from a phenomenal artist. Biggie is hands down the best storyteller in the history of hip hop;you feel like you're right there when he speaks.Except for the sex interlude,this album is flawless;get this album the get Life After Death and see what I'm talking about!!!
B00005B6N7|5.0|A good movie to watch with Dad. My father and I have been looking for movies to see together as a way to bond. U-571 did the trick. Dad was in WWII in the navy and related to the authenticity of this movie. U-571 is better the second time around. I put it in the Hunt For Red October, Executive Decision, and Clear &amp; Present Danger category of flics. <br />Matthew McConaughey did an outstanding job as he broke from the romantic comedy into a beefy role. The cast was excellent. THis is a great cabin movie when on vacation.<br />Highly recommended!

0805062971|5.0|First things first, Chuck Palahniuk is a master when it comes to bring the late 20 Century regular male specimen's psique to the paper -- and the female too, mainly in \\"Invisible Monsters\\". His world is compound of regular people, like us, that in a edgy moment make a slight change and it affects everything. So far, we've seen this in hundreds of books, but his characters, their fears and joys are so unique that he makes me wish writing like him. Or at least be as smart as him. And if you think he is a fluke, try his pos-Fight Club novels, whatever.<br />Personal issues aside, \\"Fight Club\\" is a delightful novel about the nihilism an other feelings of the late 20 century and the prospect of mankind somehow for the 21. The narrator is numb, like many drug addicts he cannot feel new experiences, so he must go to a higher level in order to have his neurotransmissors working. He can't even sleep. Insomnia is not his actual problem, this is just a sympton. The first step is to meet people with terminal diseases in support groups . Later, this doesn't work anymore. His biggest step: Fight Club.<br />Forget all about you've heard about violence. If you think this novel is violent you haven't paid too much attention to the world lately . The violence here is graphic sometimes, but it is not the hardest part for reading.  Nevertheless, it is a scary and painfull experience. It seems to me that FG is one of the best portrait of my generation. The desperate feeling for new things and for getting things harder and harder.<br />From time to time a stunning sentence pops up in the novel. \\"It's your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.\\" \\"(...)Our culture has made us all the same. (...) Indivually, we are nothing.\\" Or \\"I am the toxic waste by-product of God's creation.\\" And many others called my attention. Palahniuk's sentences are very short, but at the same time very effecitve. The periods are also small what makes the reading pretty fast.<br />The movie based on the novel is remarkable, thanks to Jim Uhls' script & David Fincher's dark, smart and unique mise-en-sc&egrave;ne among other things, like Edward Norton's perfect numb nameless narrator & Brad Pitt's subversive and funny Tyler Durden. After seeing the movie, it is impossible to imagine two other actors playing there characters. Despite some different through the narrative and the ending, both --novel and movie-- leave quite the same  feeling in the audience/readers. The result is the same.<br />I don't recommend reading --or watching -- \\"Fight Club\\" to everybody. It tackles subjects that are too hard to some people, like self-improvement -- self-destruction --, terminal diseases and \\"Michief. Mayhem. Soap.\\", as the cover says. But those who dare to step into the fight club will not regret. You may not like it, but you won't be indifferent to it.<br />In the end it feels like you've spent your whole Saturday night in the Fight Club, and you can't hardly wait for the next weekend. Like Tyler says to the narrator, you'll say \\"I want you to hit me as hard as you can, Mr. Palahniuk\\". And hopefully he will do so with another amazing book.el is remarkable, thanks to Jim Uhls' script & David Fincher's dark, smart and unique mise-en-scène among other things, like Edward Norton's perfect numb nameless narrator & Brad Pitt's subversive and funny Tyler Durden.

B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is a captivating epic that stars (and is directed by) Mel Gibson.  It is basically about a young Scottish man named William Wallace and his life.  The story starts with him as a boy and his father being killed in war.  He is then taken to be raised by his warrior-like uncle who teaches him to fight and protect himself.  William then returns to his home village and falls in love with a young lady he knew when he was a child.  The two secretely get married.  All seems well until the English kill William's wife. <BR> This is the point in the story where William begins his revolution and fight to free Scotland.  Followed by thousands, Gibson gives a stunning performance.  There is a lot of great war action to keep you action buff's at bay, and lots of great scenes with incredible drama for you saps out there.<BR> Overall, Braveheart is a film that will keep you waiting to go to the bathroom for as long as three hours.  There is never a dull moment and is a film that can be appreciated by all types of people alike!
0316666343|5.0|I read &quot;Lucky&quot; in one evening, and &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is just as masterful. You will fall in love with Susie as she tells her story from heaven. You will thank heaven that we have a writer like Alice Sebold.
0312265859|5.0|It's difficult for there to be too many surprises in the 8th book in a series, and I can't say there were many here.  But what I was suprised about, frankly, was that I personally didn't find that to be tiresome or dull.  Sure, at this point, one pretty much expects that our heroine, Stephanie, will be torn between two men, get some cars blown up, make some incredibly silly decisions, have Lula and her granny tag along, and be subjected to lots of head shakings.  I don't quite know how she did it, but I think that Janet Evanovich manages to keep this series fresh because she creates such interesting, dynamic, silly, and fun characters - people that, despite the crazy happenings in the novels, actually seem pretty real.  Even those on the periphery of the story have distinct personalities, and it is this, I think, more than the particular mystery in the book that makes it interesting - and the mystery here, while different than some others, is rather tame, despite the appearance of a new uber-villian.  <br />If anyone is going into this book expecting revolutionary character growth, that reader will probably be disappointed.  Similarly, if this is the first Stephanie Plum novel someone reads, a lot will probably be lost without the history presented in the previous seven.  But if you enjoyed the other books - and aren't yet tired of Stephanie's antics, the Morelli-Ranger-Stephanie triangle, and the bizarre and pretty unbelievable events in the Burg, this is the book for you.  I'm not sure a writer with less skill and humor could maintain my interest this long, but I think Janet Evanovich is doing fine, and I'll certainly be ready for book nine when it comes along.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I don't know why so many people don't like this album; I think its great. On Pop, U2 hasn't lost their old edge, they just experiment with more electronica than on Achtung Baby and sometimes it comes across as pop..but wasn't that the point? &quot;Discotheque&quot; is unlike any other U2 song and &quot;Staring At the Sun&quot; is reminescent of past songs, but with a slighty more electronic touch. Pop is one of my favorite U2 albums. Its everything I could have wanted, plus a little more. Thats not selling out-its evolving.
B0000203YT|1.0|This movie was sooooo bad. I had to fast forward through half of the movie because i was falling a sleep.It was really pathetic!! The only thing i liked in this movie were the costumes. Totally skip this movie!!!
0446608955|4.0|This book was the first book that I read of Nicholas Sparks. The story line is amazing and I cried sevral times throught reading. While I found it a bit confusing in the beginning I grew to love it as the personalities of the chracters are revealed through the story. The ending touched me and I was very pleased I took the time to read it.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|The filmmakers took much creative license in portraying Nash's life and ultimately rob it of any realism or pathos. If you buy in to Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly's Hollywood makeover you are rewarded with a pretty conventional love conquers all story but this would have been a better film if it were told in a small way without the big budgets, beautiful actors and artificially sweetened ending.
B000066C1N|5.0|I strongly urge anyone who has the slightest Taste for good music to buy this soundtrack. It an absoulute master piece<br />I admit i had my doubts about this soundtrack but then a friend urged me to get it so i did. I am glad too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />...
B000002GC2|5.0|Quincy Jones is one of my favourite artists and I seek out work that he has done particularly in the 70's and early 80's. This CD represented the pinnacle of his career with an album that had so many standout tracks. \\"Ai No Corrida\\" was one of the first songs that I loved and even today, it still makes me feel great. It and \\"Razzamatazz\\" were the sound of the future. Quincy made great choices with the songwriters and artists that he worked with and his own production completed a classic piece of work. If I were you, I'd click buy right now and bring a classic into your life.
B000002L9J|5.0|The year is 1988 and three friends are hanging out in the high school library. Somehow they've conned their teachers into letting them do independent study during first period of their last semester of high school. I'm supposedly taking independent study physics, Chris is taking independent study German, and Cynthia is library assistant or some such nonsense. Anyway, all we do most mornings is sit around and talk. This morning is no different.<br />\\"I don't like that awful Led Zeppelin you listen to. I love the Smiths,\\" declares Cynthia. <br />\\"The Smiths aren't any good\\", I sneer, hoping Cynthia doesn't know I've never heard a single song by them.<br />\\"Yeah, the Smiths suck,\\" adds Chris, as unfamiliar with the Smiths as myself.<br />Sufficiently miffed, Cynthia rises, tugs on the front of her Meat Is Murder T-shirt, and strides purposefully out of the room. Chris and I just laugh at our poor misguided friend.<br />The year is now 2002 and I'm contemplating how closed-minded I was as a youth. If it wasn't classic rock, southern rock, or metal, I wasn't listening to it. But once I got to college, I started opening my mind to new types of music, and sure enough, I eventually got around to giving the Smiths a chance.<br />The first Smiths album I heard was the Queen Is Dead. The first four songs sounded odd, but not entirely offensive to my metal-trained ears. Then when I heard 'Cemetry Gates', I gave up all resistance. The jangly guitars of Johnny Marr and the gloriously over the top vocals and uniquely clever lyrics of Morrissey were almost too much for me. Imagine then, when 'Big Mouth Strikes Again' came on. It rocked as hard as anything else I was listening to at the time and was twice as clever. Believe me, I kept listening intently until the final fade out of the irresistibly catchy 'Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others', and then admitted to myself I'd made a dreadful mistake that day in high school. Hopefully, Cynthia has realized her mistake when it comes to Led Zeppelin since then as well.
0316777722|2.0|First let me say that the first chapter was hilarious.  AFter that, it slows down rapidly.  I think the reason is that the author is so obsessed with his own homosexuality and he loses a large base of his audience, at least me.<br />When he speaks of his childhood and his famly, he's hilarious.  His dad is a wonderful, colorful character that David completely doesn't understand.  His mom, a foul mouth, but nothing compared to his brother.  But in the midst of it, you could hear Sedaris saying,<br />\\"Oh, by the way, I'm a homosexual.\\"<BR>\\"Did I tell you yet, that I'm a homosexual?\\"<BR>\\"Don't forget, I am a homosexual.\\"<BR>\\"I have a boyfriend.  Because I'm a homosexual.\\"<BR>\\"This is life through the lens of homosexuality.\\"<BR>\\"It's been a while so let me remind you...\\"<br />And I couldn't help saying, \\"Yes David, I know what you are.\\"  After he moves with his boyfriend to Paris, I gave up and skipped until I found chapters about dad again.  The senior Sedaris is the breakout star of this book, followed by his great dane.<br />But next time you're at the library, read the first chapter, because it is hilarious, and then... maybe find something else to read.
B000059T5O|5.0|Whether you are a Tom Waits or a John Hammond fan ...or just a  fan of good music, this is a CD you should check out. Very enjoyable. Excellent songs well performed and well recorded. Maybe the best single CD from either Tom Waits or John Hammond.
0553284347|4.0|This book was great for me to read. It helped, and the best part is, I could see myself in the pages. You can't expect your abusive parents to admit what they did. You can't expect your siblings to see them the same as you. And don't expect them to change. The only person you can control is you.<br />One thing my therapist pointed out, though, was that I was only remembering the upsetting stuff. I don't think that book helps as far as that goes. There were good times when I grew up, but the shadows were too long, so I saw everything in a darkness.
B00005QDW1|5.0|The illiterate fools above me absolutely do not under any circumstances know what they are talking about. This is an extremely well planned masterpiece. I reccomend it to anyone who likes No Doubt. There is a variation compared to their other music, but change is good. If you listen to the words they are very intrigueing. Obviously the reviewers above me maybe listened to half of the songs and did not give any thought of what they were listening to.  All of No Doubt show their dedication and love for music in this album.
B000063K2W|5.0|It is a heartbreaking shame that most of the great classic MGM films have yet to see DVD release. Hopefully Turner and Warner Bros. (who own those movies now) have started uncork the champagne bottle, because this DVD of George Cukor's 1939 classic THE WOMEN is a stunner! Few films can even try to compete with this one for its star-power, its wit, its style, and its timeless ability to entertain and entrance an audience.<br />Now, comes this DVD looking downright gorgeous, and beautifully put together by Warner Home Video. The film itself has \\"never looked so beautiful before\\" (to quote another MGM classic!) and you get a host of great extras. The B&W image of the feature is crisp and sharp, and the Technicolor fashion show sequence is now lustrous, when it used to look pallid. One of the bonus features is the same fashion show sequence, as filmed in B&W, and you can even see stars Norma Shearer and Rosalind Russell in character, watching the parade of designer outfits in front of them.<br />The disc also provides two dandy MGM promotional shorts. One of them is FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH made in 1939, which has excerpts from lots of Metro features of the day including THE WOMEN, with alternate takes, different from those in the movie. The other short HOLLYWOOD STYLE CENTER OF THE WORLD has a quick glimpse of famous fashion designed Adrian. In adddition, the DVD provides what seems to be all the music from the film, as recorded on the MGM soundstage. Listening to these music cues is a treat for anyone who loves this film. It even sounds like the Main Title and Fashion Show cues are in stereo. Other bonus features include the WOMEN trailer, the trailer for the re-make THE OPPOSITE SEX, and a very informative and well-written production essay. Who knew that F. Scott Fitzgerald contributed to the script of this masterpiece? That's just one of the trivia pieces to be found here.<br />As for the film itself, the magnificent performances of Shearer, Crawford, Russell, Goddard, Boland & Co. will never be equalled. If you liked the recent Broadway revival (which can't begin to compare to this definitive film), get the REAL DEAL! This is essential viewing for anyone who appreciates great filmmaking, especially from the \\"Golden Era\\"!
B000002HRE|5.0|Ok. This may not be Metallica's greatest album. Their glory days died when the 80's ended. However, that doesn't mean that Metallica is now the epitome of god awful, commercialized music. And Re-Load is an excellent example of a band that continues to evolve. Re-load clearly shows some country influences, a tact rarely tried in metal, and is able to pull it off quite well. While they still have some songs that you can quite ably headbang to, this cd shows their sound becoming more relaxed.
B00006690G|4.0|While \\"The Eminem Show\\" isn't as great as \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", it is still a very awesome disc and should satisfy fans of his music. The best songs are \\"White America\\", \\"Business\\", \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Without Me\\", \\"Sing For The Moment\\", and \\"Halie's Song\\". There isn't a bad song, but those are the ones that REALLY stand out. 3 CDs into his career it's obvious Eminem is one of the best rappers ever and that he can rap circles around other rappers who still get more respect because they aren't white. But Anyway, \\"The Eminem Show\\" is a great album that shows Eminem's skills as a rapper and razor-tongued lyricist. If you like Eminem' other stuff, get \\"THE EMINEM SHOW\\", its worth it!
0151008116|5.0|If you read often or browse the bookstores you find that there seem to be a limited number of plot designs and a finite number of characters.  The names and cities change but the stories all sort of blend together.  There are some authors who are more skilled at word flow than others and seem more comfortable with their style but a similarity exists that makes reading even the best volumes mundane.<br />Then you get the joyful opportunity to discover a book like Martel's Life of Pi.  This is a story like no other. There is a plot unique, thought provoking and inspiring; a main character who presents a persona so important and so basic to life and an author who writes with such ease and comfort that you think he is speaking with you in your living room over coffee.<br />Main character Piscine [Pi] is stranded in a life raft with a tiger after a ship wreck.  Don't let the seeming trviality of this brief plot review dissuade you.  Only an author with the imagination and genius of Martel could make this work.  It works so very well.  Read this book with an open mind as Martel details his suffering, his thoughts, his feelings, his emotional drain and most importantly his relationship with the tiger.  Try hard to understand what Mr. Martel is really talking about and dare to think about how you would react to the situations presented after 200 days at sea in a 26 foot raft.<br />For every 20 books I read I pray one will be like this.  It is one of the few books I have ever read that I think I could read again.
B00004NRWH|5.0|This was Nickelback's first ever official CD, after the independant releases of Hesher and Curb. Here's a review of my opinions on the songs:<br />Breathe 9/10: This once top-ten hit has a great chorus, which is actually very catchy. The very modern guitar music is also great!<br />Cowboy Hat 10/10: I downloaded this song before I got the CD, and it rocked my world! This was my favorite Nickelback song for a long time, with grwta lyrics, verses, and choruses<br />Leader of Men 8/10: Don't get me wrong, I like this song, it's just that it ranked higher than any other song on this CD, and I don't think it's that great. It was original, switching from a slow, near-country song to a fast-moving rock song in a matter of seconds, but it is not the best.<br />Old Enough 10/10: This is my current favorite song. From the bizarre opening to the catchy rock to the uplifting chorus, this is a great song. In it's day, it went to the top twenty in the nation, and I think it should have gone higher.<br />Worthy to Say 9/10: Ah, a Nickelback CD would not be complete without a crime song. However, they're good at this, and it is a great song, even if it has a country twang to it. This song probably would have gotten more publicity if the music video was \\"acceptable\\" on most channels.<br />Diggin' This 7/10: This is the fall of the CD. During the State, Nickelback's strong point was obviosly the guitar, and when they rely on vocals, this is what happens. It's standable, but it's no hit.<br />Deep 7/10: This is about the same thing. The guitars are screwed up and the vocals are too soft. The only standable thing about this song is the grear chorus.<br />One Last Run 6/10: Another crime song, but this one just didn't have the same 'click' to me as Worthy to Say did. The music is not too bad, but it doesn't even measure up to Deep or Diggin This.<br />Not Leaving Yet 8/10: An oasis in the middle of the desert, this song lifted me up while listening to the other \\"failing\\" songs of the State. It's a good song that did not live up to the music it had.<br />Hold Out Your Hand 6/10: This is another song I did not like too much. It was not enough of rock for me, so I only gave it a 6 out of 10.<br />Leader of Men (accoustic) 4/10: Alright, the only thing that made me like Leader of Men was the hard rock part at the end. When they take that away. the song is nothing, or at least for me.<br />Overall, this CD is great, especially the first five tracks and Not Leaving Yet.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril just happened to pop up in my life while working. The radio station said she was new with a fresh sound. They were right. Avril Lavigne's Complicated played on the overhead speakers as a nodded my head to the catchy beat, and I instantly connected with the lyrics of the song. After hearing only one song, I had a new favorite musician. Instantly, I went out and bought Let Go, and I was even more impressed by the talent of Avril and her band. <BR> <BR> All the tracks on the cd make for great listening. The lyrics seem to be from the heart and most are relateable. There's also a hint of different styles of music. Avril really hits it hard with Losing Grip and Unwanted. Both are great power ballads -- in a good way. A little bit of pop -- but not too much, just enough -- can be found in Anything but Ordinary (My favorite track!), Things I'll Never Say, and My World. Avril's punk style completely shines through in the catchy Sk8r Boi. I'm With You and Naked are deep songs with thought, and Mobile, Tomorrow, and Too Much to Ask are also great listens.<BR>  <BR> Already, Avril has a dedicated fanbase. Here's to it lasting.
B000066C6Z|5.0|I've been patiently waiting for this DVD release for a couple of years now. Airplane I&II and the Naked Gun series are great, but this one is the best. The Omar Sharif \\"compact car\\" scene is a classic and it still puts me on the floor after all of these years. If you like the Zucker Bros. movies, you'll love \\"Top Secret\\".
B00005OAIE|3.0|I like John Mayer's music. It's simple, acoustic, and there is an all around goodness in his voice. Most of the songs on Room for Squares are quite sober, but that's a good thing. John's voice goes right along with the soberness of the songs. His voice is smooth and soothing, and flows right along with the instrumentals which is mostly combined of his own guitar and occasionally a piano or another extraneous instrument. It seems as if his style of making music is writing his feelings down on paper, picking up the guitar and finding the right tune, and calling it song. And there's no negativity in that here on Room for Squares. Every song works. Although I do have my favorites. Those being his first single No Such Thing, and My Stupid Mouth, Your Body Is a Wonderland, Neon, Not Myself, and St. Patrick's Day. I say, if John Mayer continues to make music, I will continue to listen.
B000000OU4|5.0|It seems critics here either loved it or hated it. It's true this is very different to any of his other previous records and yes it seems as if his music here is very pop influenced. Yet I don't see how this is a bad thing. Some people don't like to see their musicians grow or try new things because they are comfortable with their present style. Well in music comfortable is not something to be proud of. A true musician must branch out and try new things so other elements can be integrated into their music. In this record I don't see any type of failure. I see Metheny has successfully mastered another style of music while putting his own spin on it. I also see that the songs are just not of substance but they are also quite &quot;catchy&quot; and very beautiful at times. I feel some of his best work shows up here. &quot;Episode D'Azur&quot; is a very distinctive Metheny work and probably the jazziest of all the songs. &quot;Stranger in town&quot; has a great up-tempo rhythm played by Wertico along with Methenys complex, fast-paced guitar work which seems to have a very nice Hendrix influence for one brief period. Also I found &quot;And Then I Knew&quot; to have a great melody. Although it does seeem &quot;Something to Remind You&quot; and &quot;Red Sky&quot;  are very similar musically and how they were both carried along, yet I still favour &quot;Red Sky&quot; due to the vocal parts. I think PMG will benefit from this compilation and I feel it is the perfect follow-up to &quot;The Road To You&quot;.
B00005JKCF|5.0|a lot like the books and comics,a few minor differences,excellent show,i look for more.
B000005IRG|5.0|In the mid 70's in the U.K.we were sick to the back teeth of all the progressive music going around.In my opinion,the only man with any clout during that era was Neil Young! Then along came Television and my life changed for the better. \\"Marquee moon\\" is timeless,you never tire listening to it.Verlaine and Lloyd's guitar interplay is fantastic,the solo on the final track \\"Torn curtain\\",is magical.<BR>Verlaine's lyrics throughout the album are very surreal and he comes away with some classic lines\\"Hey,man,let's dress up like Cops,think what we could do-something,something said you better not\\"(Venus)<BR>Although \\"Adventure \\" was a fine album it Wasn't the classic \\"MM\\" was,with the band reformed for a short Summer tour,let's hope they stay together for a new album,on the recent tour they seemed to be enjoying themselves !!
B00003CWRX|5.0|At just over 2 1/2 hours, there is not a single moment wasted in this amazing picture.  I've probably watched it five times now, and each time I see it I see new things and gain more appreciation for every aspect of this movie.<br />As you probably already know, this is a film about a man who blows the whistle on Big Tobacco, putting his entire life as he knows it into complete turmoil.  Russell Crowe does a superb job transforming himself into Jeffrey Wigand, commendably acting against Al Pacino, who really is doing what he always does, but here it works perfectly.  Watching him take total charge of each moral argument he is forced to confront is really a blast.<br />The camerawork is superb--every shot has purpose and meaning, and usually is visually exciting in some way or another, right down to simply watching a character move through a hallway.  The choice of settings and lighting are constantly pleasing and noteworthy.  Even the use of the hand-held camera a la NYPD Blue, a technique that I usually find completely annoying, was appropriate and integrated nearly seamlessly into the general flow of images.<br />Finally, the music is done in the same manner as in Heat, another Mann film, in the form of mostly already composed pieces by already known artists.  Mann employs a wide range of artists in his general montage--the ones I noticed outright were Lisa Gerrard, Einsturzende Neubauten, and Massive Attack in the closing scene in a trip-hop pulse that fits the whole wrap up perfectly.  <br />Even with the serious nature of the subject matter I have been able to watch this movie over and over, and I will continue to pull it out and share it with whoever will watch.
0553579908|5.0|A Clash of Kings is the second book in the series A Song of Ice and Fire. This book has much less magic and a lot more political intrigue than normal fantasy. The cultures of the people in this book are very rich. It takes place largely in a country called the Seven Kingdoms, which is run with a feudal system like in medieval Europe with lords, ladies, knights, and kings.<BR> <BR>The characters are very complex, realistic and numerous. The author gives you a good understanding of the people by writing each chapter from the point of view of a character. This allows the reader to understand many characters very well without the author explaining them to you directly. One thing that makes the characters realistic is that they aren't completely good or completely bad. One example of a good and bad character in A Clash of Kings is the ten-year-old girl Arya. In the first book in this series she had a loving heart, and just wants to have fun. In the second book many bad things happened to her and her hatred against people that have hurt her becomes a very strong part of her life. She starts praying every night for those people who were cruel to her to die. In comparison most books have a hero who is really good and a villain who is really bad. <br />A Clash of Kings like the other two published books in this series has an unpredictable yet conceivable plot. The story is really a composite of many subplots that draw a complex picture of an overall plot. <br />A huge fault in most fantasy books today is that the main characters repeatedly go through life threatening circumstances but don't die. One way the story in A Clash of Kings is realistic is that good central characters in it die. But the bad side of this is that when a character who you love dies you'll feel numb for a few minuets or you will just want to lay down in bed and cry. At least those are some of the things that happened to me in this book and the ones before and after it. <br />A bad thing about this bookis that the sex is very graphic. I would advise not giving this book to a child or a young teenager because of it. If you read the book yourself I recommend skipping ahead a page or two every time you encounter a sex seen. The first and third books in this unfinished series have a lot of sex in them too. <br />Religion seems to play a major part of this book. There are three major religions that the characters believe in. The first, the tree religion, is the predominant religion in the northern part of the Seven Kingdoms. Practisers of it pray to weirwoods, a type of tree that has white bark, red sap and carvings of a mouth and eyes. The trees answer back by how the wind moves. They are referred to as the \\"old gods\\". The people in the southern part of the Seven Kingdoms believe in the \\"new gods\\" and worship and pray to them in temples. The third religion, which is common in several regions outside of the Seven Kingdoms, believes in one god called R'hllor. This god seems to be much more powerful than any of the other gods in this book and also much more evil. One reason I think R'hllor is an evil god is because his religion has evil practices in it. One example is that R'hllor's followers throw people on bon fires to give their god glory.<br />After reading all three published books in A Song of Fire and Ice I believe that this series is not Christian. As a Christian and an avid fantasy reader I look for Christian fantasy books but I haven't found many. The Chronicles of Narnia (a great series for all ages) by C. S. Lewis, the Oneprince by Bill Hand, and Children in the Night by Harold Myra (one of the most imaginative of any of the fantisies I've ever read) are the only Christian fantasy books I've discovered. I really wish there was more available. <br />To sum up A Clash of Kings the people and plot of this book are interesting, realistic, and complex, but there is too much sex.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayor is truly awesome.  His first album Room For Squares is a must have.  With catchy melodies, great guitar, jazz, and a great lyricst to top all that off.  John shines on such songs as Neon, City Life, 83, Back To You, and St. Patrick's day.  He a great musican with a raspy type of voice resembleming Dave Matthews.  He sings about love realtionships and childhood.  He's an everday kind of guy that u could relate to in his songs.  Sit back relax and enjoy this album pick it up if u don't already have.

0553103547|5.0|This fantasy series is arguably the best I've ever seen.  I'm just now getting around to writing a review of it, even though I've read it thrice since 1999.  Now, before you say \\"Ugh, another fanatic!\\", just look at three major differences (in a genre of worn-out plots and character types, this is a good thing) between this book and others.<br />1. In A Game of Thrones, there is almost no magic.  Some people may see this as a bad thing, but I didn't.  Take the Lord of the Rings, for instance; most magic happens off-stage.  In Martin's universe, we know it exists (magic does make brief appearances at the beginning and end of Thrones) without having our noses rubbed in it, unlike some *other* authors.  The result is what could almost be a first-hand historical account of medieval intrigue.<br />2. Bad things happen to good people.  Yes, this has been noted by many other commentators, but I think that it's worth mentioning again.  Rather than having one omnipotent protagonist, we have a slew of equally interesting characters who each have their own little (and not so little) problems.  And bad things do happen.<br />3. A gray tone of morality permeates the book.  Rather than typecast all of the characters (the Savior and his followers vs. the Destroyer and the Armies of Darkness), Martin has put a giddying amount of time into developing them to ensure that none are as good or evil as they might appear.  Yes, there are megalomaniacs.  Yes, there are folks who fight for truth, justice, and the Westerosi way.  And there are even a couple of jerks in their own right.  But once each is analyzed, we find that none is quite as black or white as they seem.  There is a noble lord who is the very soul of honor and justice...but it is revealed that he has fathered a bastard.<br />If you don't believe any of this, read the book.  Trust me, those 800+ pages will seem to melt away as you allow yourself to be enchanted by A Game of Thrones.
0451191153|1.0|Let's begin with the fatal flaw of the book: the protagonist, Roark, RAPES a woman, who then becomes his willing lover.  This is akin to a Holocaust survivor marrying a member of the Nazi S.S.  All fans of this book (mostly young White men) need to address the deep sexism and misogyny here. <br />The plot is hackneyed and boring: a man pursues his dreams and ideals despite a world of cartoonish idiots around him.  It's how teenage boys often feel.  There is a hatefulness of weakness, gentleness, and calm: no wonder many right-wingers celebrate Rand. <br />The goal is admirable: to think for oneself and be creative, but the novel is truly a piece of junk.  Why not read true artists who urge you to think for yourself?  Jack Kerouac, Emma Goldman, Ken Kesey, and John Steinbeck are some wonderful alternatives.  <br />After all, you don't have to hate the world, and hate women, to live a creative, independent life.  You can love your society, community, and your lover, and be true to yourself... All at the same time.
B001992NUQ|5.0|To say that David Fincher's film Fight Club is underrated or for some intellectual film buffs would like to facetiously use the phrase, \\"sleeper hit\\", is possibly the biggest understatement of the last decade. One small but highly significant reason for this under appreciation (In terms of box office revenue) lies in the failure of the marketing department to promote this film appropriately. On the contrary, it's subject matter and material did not render this an easy task. With a very deceptive title like Fight Club, most audiences assumed this film to be simply just that, a film about fighting. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In 1999 all that the film had going for it was Brad Pitt, end of story. Although I have not seen all of David Fincher's films I feel it is safe to assume that this will probably be one of my favorites among his other impressive titles in his catalog. This film is not just a highly successful book to film adaptation, (not to mention put Chuck Palahnuik on the map as a respected author) but manages to execute it's dark, witty, clever dialogue in such a timely and entertaining fashion that it remains quite memorable and very satisfying. The 10th anniversary Blu Ray edition of this movie is nothing short of spectacular; it's audio and visual department does not disappoint, but truly and fully utilizes the Blu Ray technology to its advantage. The technical part of my review will be saved for the last so I hope you will pace yourself. Enough said, I will begin.     The narrator (Edward Norton), who does not go by any particular name in the film, works for an insurance company that investigates claims involving automobiles. His mundane but financially rewarding occupation requires very extensive traveling that renders the narrator to lead a very isolated and lonely life. Even when he is not traveling, we see him completing very repetitive sedentary office work that involves little interaction with anyone besides his unlikeableand distasteful boss. Adversely, this demanding occupation profoundly affects the narrator's ability to sleep as he suffers from acute insomnia and what also appears to be severe depression. As a result, Norton's derives a substantial amount of pleasure indulging in magazine catalogs and purchasing various collector set items such as trendy furniture, fashionable dish sets with all the small intended imperfections, tread mills, coffee tables, and other novelties. In order to treat his insomnia, the narrator consults a doctor only to find out that he will not be prescribed any medication but suggested to seek treatment in support groups for various forms of cancer to witness real \\"pain\\". Subsequently, an addiction follows from this experience when Norton admit tingly feels attracted to the universal atmosphere of sadness and emotional engagement with strangers. (Meat Loaf being one of them, go figure) It is here that the narrator comes across a woman named Martha (Helena Bonham Carter) who is a \\"faker\\" according to him because she does not genuinely suffer from any of the interminable diseases in the support groups but only participates for the movies and free coffee.     On a plane during a midnight business travel we are introduced to Edward Norton's significant other/anti-hero, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) when they are seated next to each other. Tyler Durden is a very clever, knowledgeable and highly entertaining salesman in the business of selling soap. He is filled with arbitrary useful facts about potentially explosive household items, history and even philosophy to some extent; moreover, he comes across as very dark but amusing and personally engaging to say the very least. There on screen chemistry is highly plausible and works to perfection in every scene. The relationship between these two characters is further solidified when they meet for the second time after Norton's trendy apartment is mysteriously blown to bits all over the sidewalk. The narrator pondersthe root cause to be a freak electrical occurrence. Despite of this catastrophic event (or is it ?), Norton finds comfort in calling Tyler Durden where they rendezvous at a local bar for some drinks; the narrator vents over his materialistic losses while Tyler Durden simply offers some solace with a very interesting and enlightening outlook on the relationship between human evolution and American culture.     The narrator and Tyler Durden embark on a dark journey that reveals the truth about themselves and about society as well; and, as a result, a much deeper and more genuine relationship occurs between these two characters especially when Tyler Durden asks Norton for a favor in return for his hospitable shelter, \\"To hit him as hard as he can.\\"     Now, this film packs a very heavy social commentary that delves around many salient topics and themes that are bound to strike some interest in the careful and observant film goer. (At least I hope so) Personally, what struck me as important and intriguing what it's social commentary on corporations and their potentially adverse effects on American culture and human emotions, or in the narrator's case, lack thereof. The narrator exhibits symptoms of insomnia because he is ultimately depressed working in a single serving, dispensable and yet fast paced environment (at least when he's traveling) that deprives him of maintaing any real interaction with friends and family. Unfortunately and in spite of this, we see him enjoying the true and last American value in this country that becomes more prevalent within each passing year, consumerism, or as Tyler Durden puts it more plainly and effectively \\"Buying S--- we don't need\\".     The narrator's life is consumed by the corporation as he inspects some of the most horrific car accidents, spends a considerable amount of time air traveling not too mention ordered around by a very unpleasant and discontented boss who is rarely satisfied. Let's just say that his work environment does not fully endorse the mechanism of positive reinforcement. A profound feeling of emptiness engulfs this character to the extreme point of him finding solace in things such as cancer support groups or in buying endless items in magazine catalogs; the narrator is merely struggling to find any form of emotion in this depraved and depressing American culture we live in. As a result, our anti-hero fills this empty space with feeling pain in fighting and even indulges in what seems to be a subtle form of masochistic behavior such as burning himself with chemicals or throwing himself into glass shelves. The corporation persistently produces this potent and profound feeling of emptiness that strips the narrator of his individuality by artificially organizing it for him. You are not an individual but a team member or a team player working for a much bigger and more important company. And we wonder why so many Americans are prescribed anti-depressant drugs and medication. The bottom line is that the individual is more often than not wrongly perceived as the problem and not the sick cultural environment that one works or interacts in.     Ok, onto the technical specs of this masterpiece because that is what this film is and looks like, a masterpiece. I purchased the 2-disc dvd back in 2002 and I was utterly impressed with the quality of it along with it's array of supplemental material. Without exaggerating in the slightest bit, this Blu Ray completely puts the previous dvd release to shame. I did a thorough compare and contrast and it was worth every minute of to see the nice upgrade make it to my home. If I had to describe this transfer in one word, the word flawless justifies this very accurately.     Cinematically, this is a very dark film indeed that manages to seamlessly and effectively intertwine with the nature of the material presented. Black levels are incredibly deep and consistent that allow some of the more bright colors to filter through quite nicely, particularly in the underground garage scenes. Pay attention to the vibrant and lively green neon reflections when the camera rapidly spirals down into the garage to expose the detonated explosives. Truly remarkable. Flesh tones are real and appear very natural and lifelike throughout the entire film whether it is during the abundant night shots, the interior house on paper st, the underground garage, or the massive corporate buildings. When Edward Norton attempts to deactivate one of the sets of explosives in the white van pay close attention to the sweat drops on his forehead or Brad Pitt's light facial hair, amazing.     Like the picture quality, the sound will not disappoint either boasting a very nice DTS. 5.1 HD Master Audio. The Dust Brothers will immerse you in it's highly unusual and nerve racking industrial score. All of your speakers will given the royal treatment with this one, I can assure you on this. Dialogue is nothing short of perfection; moreover, it is clear, articulate and very consistent. I can also rest assure you that your subwoofer will not be left alone in the dark either as explosions will vibrate your floor while the heart pounding score will add a nice touch to the unsettling atmosphere. Every scene in this film is quite mesmerizing in terms of picture and sound but If I could specifically point out a great scene in which captivates all of these things accurately, I will have to say pay attention to when Edward Norton deactivates the explosive in the garage and subsequently battles Tyler Durden; shattered car mirrors will pierce your front speakers; glass toll booths breaks with superiority, hand to hand combat is exchanged wonderfully and a very nice clothesline executed by Tyler Durden will definitely spark some enthusiasm.     This by far one of the most superior and worthy Blu Rays out on the Market. Enough Said. A must buy.
B00005YU1O|4.0|Animation is not usually associated with deep thinking, but \\"Waking Life\\" is an exception.  In fact, the animation is precisely what makes this film work so well.  A synopsis of the plot is impossible, but essentially a gen-X type character drifts in (and out?) of a dream state.  Along the way, he talks to various deep thinkers who share their ideas about dreams, life, and religion.  The different actors kind of play themselves and primarily deliver monologues to the main character, who is frequently passive.  Sounds pretty grim, but it's definitely not.  True, if this movie wasn't animated, it would be incredibly pretentious.  However, the animation, which is spectacular, really helps ground this film.<br />There are certain scenes I'll never forget from this film, particulary the revelation that one cannot turn off the lights in dreams (whether that's true or not is irrelevant).  Different segments of the film have been done by different animators, which helps keep things fresh throughout.  Most of the stars are not well-known, but watch for Ethan Hawke and Nicky Katt, among others.<br />I avoided seeing this film in the theaters, despite the stellar reviews, because I am not a fan of movies that explore philosophical or religious issues in such depth.  However, I found myself enjoying the movie immensely.  It's funny and thought provoking.  Highly recommended, especially for persons interested in philosophy and religion.
B000065V1V|4.0|I haven't read any of the critics reviews yet, and probably won't, because with any artist, and I stress the word artist, like Bowie, you really never know what you are going to get. I never go into buying a Bowie album expecting anything other than great music, and that's what you get here. Bowie shows off his hip choices for covers on Heathen. A Pixies song, &quot;Cactus&quot; A Neil Young tune, &quot;I've been waiting for you&quot; Also a song that is not an original is &quot;I took a trip in a Gemini Spaceship&quot; The covers are all of good quality, but its the original tunes that really shine. Songs such as &quot;Slow Burn&quot; with Pete Townsed on guitar, and the song &quot;Everyone says Hi&quot; which reminds me of his later work, something that perhaps could be off of his last album &quot;Hours&quot; &quot;Slip Away&quot; is another song in which Bowie delivers his signature voice with such warmth and clarity, that I can see why on the cover of the album it said: Classic Bowie circa 2002. If you enjoy his last work, you'll enjoy this. Heathen may not be a classic, but in this time of such non-talented bands making average or below albums, &quot;Heathen&quot; certainly does shine as one of the bests of the year so far.
B000066AXE|5.0|I just love John Nash, but he wouldn't BE if it weren't for his wonderful wife, Alicia. You can't help but see this was a big message in Ron Howard's choices about directing this movie. First I read the book, A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Then I saw the PBS presentation about John Nash (wonderfully done, by the way). Only then did I want to see the movie. I wanted to see John Nash and not Russell Crowe in a role. Crowe did a darn good job with a very demanding role except for his enunciation periodically when it wasn't necessary for the portrayal, but the role of Alicia, played by Jennifer Connelly, was superb. It was much truer to the Nash's reality. If she hadn't been the compassionate person she is, and Jennifer portrays this so well, John Nash would be either on the streets or dead. Ed Harris was his usual wonderful self. The &quot;treats&quot; were the addition of such icons as Judd Hirsch and Christoper Plummer. This DVD is well worth purchasing and I feel that the original movie might have received more notice at the Academy Awards if Crowe hadn't been acting so, mmmmmmmmm, snotty. His behavior hurt the film's chances of receiving even more of the accolades it deserves. The DVD is extremely clear and the sound is so good that my dog was set off barking frantically in one of the &quot;top secret mail delivery&quot; scenes. A Beautiful Job!
3895084603|5.0|R.L. Stevenson writes here the first account of a touristic journey in France. He is the first modern tourist. He penetrates and discovers the country and the people of what he calls the Loz&egrave;re, this mountain range in the south of The Central mountains in France, a range of mountains that was the locale of a protestant rebellion at the very beginning of the eighteenth century, severely repressed by Louis XIV. These protestant insurgers are known as the Camisards. Stevenson tries to discover the landscape, the natural setting of this insurrection and tries to show how the insurrection was connected to the very nature of these mountains. He also shows how no repression can change a person or a population. These old Camisards are still alive in the memory and the customs and ways of the protestant population of this region. It is the survival of this faith that interests and fascinates Stevenson. He also notices that the catholics and the protestants, at the time of his travels, lived in harmony but with an absolute divide between the two communities. A young catholic man who married a protestant girl and changed his faith in the process was unanimously condemned for this breach of loyalty. This book is also a perfect example of what tourism can and must be : the discovery of the visited people's mentality, culture, way of life, and the connection of these with the surrounding nature, and not only a quick look at monuments and other (un)perishable. One has to live with the people, no matter how little, to eat the people's food and to be in contact with the people in order to discuss general and particular subjects and to understand their way of thinking and behaving. Thus tourism becomes an adventure even in the heart of the most civilized country and only a couple of miles away from a railroad.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
0312265859|4.0|I was a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series up through book 5, then very disappointed in numbers 6 and 7. I had decided to stop reading the series til a friend convinced me to read Hard Eight and I'm glad I did.  While not quite as good as the earlier books, this one was a vast improvement over the last two, with better pacing and character development.  The dialogue was wittier and relied less on slapstick, although still very funny.  That said, I agree with others that I'd like to see Stephanie developing a few more skills at her job--after this length of time you'd think she'd be getting a LITTLE bit better at it!  She could still be funny without being so incompetent.  And I found the long-awaited love scene with Ranger perfunctory at best.  But all in all, the book was a fun read and kept me interested to the very end.
B0000636UN|2.0|A true avid SC fan am I but what's this [stuff]?  Sheryl has never been the most perceptive songwriter, depending more on cliches and formulas that have worked in the past, but I can't believe the mediocrity of these [stinky]songs!  Safe and Sound alone is totally undecipherable \\"maybe this is forver/forever fades away like a rocket ascending into space.\\" Huh?  I've read better words in high school literary magazines.  This is mindless drivel and if it had been done by a lesser-known artist it would be in the dollar bins by now.  The plethora of artists \\"helping out\\" is a gimmicky attempt to sell the album and make up for lack of originality; the overblown ballads are a big yawn; and she must have been pretty desperate for material to rehash \\"It's Only Love.\\"  Some brigt spots - the glam rocker \\"Lucky Kid\\", the soulful \\"Weather Channel\\" and \\"You're an Original\\" the only song with a trace of Sheryl's \\"sweet sneer\\"
B00006690G|3.0|I have always been a fan of eminem but in this album it truly shows his ability to entertain. He freely preachs his opinion complete with his famous curses. this album however seams more of a pop album than a rap and seams to be aimed more towards the younger generation. I feel that his first album was just the begining and this really shows us a side of eminem that has matured. I am not an extreme fan of this album(thus the 3stars) but I do think that many of the songs contained on it are great works of art. They contain truth and controversy and Im glad that we have at least one person who doesnt break it to us rapped in cotton-wool!
B00004RF98|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!!!   I'm not one to like musicals, but this is one of the few exceptions I have.  This should have been AFI's #1.  My favorite number has to be Good Mornin'.  Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds make dancing look easy.  They look like they're actually having fun making the film.  The work that went into it doesn't even show on screen.  It looks like they just made up the moves as they went along.  Donald O'Connor gives a brilliant performance in Make 'Em Laugh.  Story has it that he was in bed for 3 days recuperating after he filmed that scene--no wonder.  But he also made it look effortless.  I wish they made films like this today.  Unfortunately, all the class has died with Hollywood's best stars.  I have to tape these old films off TV or buy them.  I wish I had seen this one in the theater.  But in 1952, my parents were only kids.  Sometimes I hate being only 21.  I don't have any memories of going to the theater and seeing a really great film.  I must have watched this film a million times. If you haven't seen it, get some popcorn, get the kids (they'll love it-at least my 8 year old niece does) and WATCH IT!!!!!
B000005H40|5.0|Anything by Coltrane is great, he is the master of the saxophone, and although he doesn't quite show it here, he is a masterful soloist (ie Giant Steps) unlike Charlie Parker, who puts me to sleep, and (as shown here) can write great songs.  This is an excellent CD.  Curtis Fuller, I think, makes it worst, but Lee Morgan and Kenny Drew really spice it up (It should be Elvin Jones as drummer).  Its a great CD
B000000H4V|5.0|chaos ad is slower and more rythmic then older sepultura. it doesn't lack in heaviness though. sepultura improved with every album. andreas kisser lays down some awesome riffs, and maxs' singing and lyrics are great too. any fan of heavy music will like this.
B000002BMV|5.0|This is Journey's number one CD, staying on the number one spot on Billboard for 8 weeks. Journey is my favorite band, and this CD is one of their very best. It's one of those CDs that, no matter how hard they try, will never be able to equal. From some of the most beloved songs, Don't Stop Believin' and Open Arms, to some of their harder songs, Lay It Down and Dead or Alive, this album has the best blend of music from Journey that the bands now can't touch. This is a must by for 80's fans, Journey fans, and Steve Perry fans alike. If you are looking for something new to listen to, it's worth every minute of your time.
0316666343|5.0|My first thought on finishing The Lovely Bones, I'd probably read the best book I'll read this year..I read an ARC copy when I saw it was now available I was almost sad that I'd already read this wonderful book and didn't have it to look forward to...Don't be put off by what sounds like a rather depressing story, it is anything but that...it is almost a comforting read..Susie's heaven is one that left me smiling and actually picturing people I love who have died in just such a wonderful place..and if you are an animal lover there is one scene in this book that will touch you in a very special way...a special book this is!
B00004TH83|2.0|I'll cut to the chase. this album dissapoints on so many levels. What on earth was she thinking releasing the spectacular song &quot; I Will Love Again&quot;, which sticks out on this album like a diamond clad thumb, and then surrounding it with such dull and uninspired dreck. A guess she wanted to break into the U.S. market, which worked, but what happend to her since? GONE! Why? because she offered nothing to follow up this single with. I'm sorry but having an amazing voice, which she does, is just not enough these days.<br />Do yourself a favor, buy the CD Single. My CD of this album now resides somewhere in the dump.
B000002LSV|4.0|This is a great collection of ZZ Top songs.  However, this CD misses 5 stars due to the omission of five songs:  Waiting On The Bus, Jesus Just Left Chicago, Thank You, TV Dinners and Stages.  Otherwise, great stuff.
B00005OAIE|5.0|True, the resemblence to Dave Mathews is uncanny and undeniable, but that is no reason to look down upon, or not expect good things from this kid.  I find John's songs to be soothing, relaxing.  His blend of mellow acoustics and progressive rythems, along with his milky, borderline whispering vocals make this CD an enjoyable listen.  (For fan's of DMB's \\"Satellight\\" be sure to check out John Mayer's \\"Neon\\", arguably one of the best tracks on the albumb.) ... This guy has some major talent, and this CD is the beginning in hopefully his long line of musical proof.  I'd reccomend this to any DMB fan, David Gray fan, etc.... ... Check this guy out!

0385121679|5.0|Master Horror writer shows himself in top form with \\"THE SHINING\\" his third book, and one of his best. (I personally think BAG OF BONES, THE SHINING and CARRIE define him--of course, those are the only ones I've actually read...) <BR>This novel is about a hotel called the OVERLOOK, and with the large hotel comes its large and bizzare history. Many murders and deaths have occured there, but nevertheless recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance accepts the job of being the Overlook's caretaker over the winter. He needs money, and desperately after he lost his job from an incident that occured when he was drunk. Moving into the hotel with him is his wife, Wendy and his son, Danny. Danny sees scary visions of what's at the Overlook, namely REDRUM, but he still goes there.<BR>Creepy occurances follow in this highly suspenseful, you-can't-put-it-down novel. I read it over a spanning of about two weeks, but someone easily could pick this up in the morning and read it through. I'd reccommend this book for ages thirteen and up. Lots of sexual content and terms that some smaller readers might not be able to comprehend.<BR>This book did give me one or two nights where visions of a dead lady in a bathtub and a man in a dog suit danced around my brain. You will never forget this book, but-- you'll remember the Overlook and its spirits even more.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie is good.  I was annoyed with it when I saw it in theaters because of what happens at the end (they can't change the ending!), but I really liked it the second time because I knew what to expect and saw it with the idea that the film people had to fit an entire book into a reasonable amount of film time.  The movie is really good.   THe special features, on the other hand, are not.  There is not much point to them.  They seemed to me to be added as an afterthought, even though they get an entire disk to themselves.  Just my opinion, and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Oh, and definitely get the widescreen--you miss so much with the standard.  :)
0312979479|5.0|While not having the most ingenious denouement, nevertheless this book is definately the scariest Christie wrote.

B00003CXA2|5.0|This is the most Life-Changing video I have ever watched. My number one favourite, it follows a mentally challenged man from Alabama in the most crucial decades of the century. What will leave you watching this is Forrest's good heart. He hasn't a clue of the evil in the real world, and lives his life on a gentle breeze. The ending is remarkable! When he is talking at the end under \\"He and Jenny's tree\\", I can't help but cry. What is also entertaining is how he tells the people he sits with on the bus-stop's bench his life story. A line my mom and I laugh over is when he almost sounds annoyed as he says,\\" And I met the President of the United States, again\\" and he rolls his eyes. All in all, Forrest Gump is a must see for *almost* all ages-I don't know, I saw it for the first time when I was seven! If after you see this movie you don't feel an appreciation for life knowing that their are people as gentle, and kind as Forrest Gump, and don't wish to move to a town as charming and rural as 'Greenbo', then, well...Go watch Glitter or Crossroads!
630027179X|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorites, so please pardon me if I get carried away on a wave of superlatives. Just about every scene has some element that warrants recommendation. I'll begin with the players: Foremost in my mind is Nicholas Clay's haunting portrayal of Sir Lancelot (he was born to play this part--sadly, he passed away due to cancer in 2000); Cherie Lunghi's winsome, impish Guinnevere; Nicol Williamson's eye-catching pyrotechnics as Merlin (which annoyed me at first, but later won me over); Gabriel Byrne's fierce, proud, and doomed Uther Pendragon (for my money, the best performance he's ever given); and last but not least comes Nigel Terry's virtuoso transformation from a bumbling, dutiful son to a brave, boisterous--and for a melancholy ripple of time, heartbroken--King. The composer Trevor Jones makes great use of two musical motifs--Carl Orff's \\"O Fortuna\\" and the climax to Wagner's \\"Tannhauser Overture.\\" The most rousing sequence in the film arrives when King Arthur and his knights leave their castle and take to horse to challenge the evil Morganna. Here, Alex Thompson's cinematography, John Merritt's editing, and Orff's \\"O Fortuna\\" blend seamlessly. Image, sound, and timing become one--this little montage literally sings! (It was a touch of inspiration to garnish the galloping knights with floating flower petals.) There are few instances in film history where a non-musical has pulled this off (the race scene that ends \\"Personal Best\\" and Kelly Reno leading the horse into the ocean in \\"The Black Stallion\\" are a couple exceptions that come to mind.) This is John Boorman at his best. Mary Selway did a great job casting the film; there are many bit players sprinkled throughout that stay with me. The sets, the costumes, the art production . . . it's evident that these people were really in the mood to make a movie. What a glorious feast for the senses!
B000009EAD|4.0|This album has garnered a great deal of praise from metal fans, and with good reason.  Iced Earth keep the banner of old-school metal waving up high, and have been doing so under the radar of popular consciousness for quite some time.  This was my first Iced Earth album, and in the six months or so since I got it this band has been getting some pretty good rotation in my collection.<br />The talents of this band are obvious pretty quickly.  Matt Barlow is a terrific singer, with a very rich baritone that's rather unique in the metal world.  At times he sounds like Bruce Dickinson with a deeper voice, but on songs like \\"Disciples of the Lie\\" he spits out his vocals with a vitriolic tone that calls to mind James Hetfield or Dave Mustaine.  Jon Schaeffer's riffs pack a punch with the best of 'em, and Larry Tarnowski's solos are sharp, if not especially innovative.  The drumming isn't the most technically advanced, but it's downright surgical in its precision.  The bass isn't always as much of a presence as I'd like it to be, but in its better moments it thumps along very well.  The playing is tight, and perhaps most importantly, the band members play for the song rather than trying to wow you with their technical advancement.<br />Songwise, \\"Something Wicked\\" starts off terrifically.  \\"Burning Times\\" was a good choice for an opener, as it got my attention right away with its aggression and heaviness.  \\"Melancholy\\" slows things down at the start, but starts to hit harder as it goes on.  This tendency to start a song slow before picking up the intensity crops up often, and was definitely a good idea as it keeps the album from becoming monochromatic.  My favorite song here, \\"Disciples of the Lie,\\" however, dispenses with any urge toward slowness; it rocks hard and fast from beginning to end.  I don't normally go for ballads, but the mournful and emotive \\"Watching Over Me\\" is a cut or two above most and fits the mood of the album very well.  \\"Stand Alone\\" is another strong heavy tune, made especially effective by its relative brevity at under three minutes.  After \\"Stand Alone,\\" most of the songs are good, not great (hence the four stars).  The album gets really interesting again with the last track though, as \\"The Coming Curse\\" brings a sense of foreboding that fits its concept of the coming of evil.  I've gone on way too long, so I'm gonna wrap up now: this album is good.  Get it.eavy tune, made especially effective by its relative brevity at under three minutes.

B00003CXXP|4.0|This is a movie that goes by the future. Human beings and robots coexist in this new world. The last ones are called Mechas (mechanic) and live to serve normal people. But one day, an idea crosses humans mind: they will programme a creature that is able to love, since is the only ability Mechas do not have. This presents an important ethical question: should he be loved, too, and how could someone love a Mecha?<BR>A married couple have a son, but he's been unconscious for a long time and rests now in a frozen capsule till he is able to wake up. Meanwhile, it occurs to the father to adopt and look after a Mecha boy. The boy (Haley Joel Osment) results to be a perfect son: he is handsome and obedient, and he seems so real for everyone. However, the couple start to feel uncomfortable with his presence, because he neither eat anything nor sleep, since he is a robot, and he's always his eyes fixed in them, without blinking. <BR>They finally decide to make him being able to love. For the moment, their own son finally wakes up and comes back home. This will bring many problems; the two kids are different. The real one treats the Mecha boy badly, like a toy, because that's what he really is for him. This conflict established between them force their parents to abandon him in the forest. He's miserable, but now he tries to find the blue fairy in order to ask her to be transformed into a real boy. He goes with another Mecha (Jude Law) who helps him in his search.<BR> I liked this movie because of many things. This moving story is the same as the Pinocchio tale set in the future and, at the same time, it deals the struggle between human beings and robots. I had seen some action movies in which robots always are bad and want to destroy the humanity. However, in this movie the robots are the ones who are controlled by real people, and this shows a different view of seeing this conflict. Here we have a Mecha boy being able to love and the incapacity of his adoptive parents to love him in return. Besides, in some scenes we can see the sport of killing Mechas like a way to amuse people, and this makes robots seem good, because they don't harm anybody.<BR>Steven Spielberg's work in this movie is really good, because of  the places on which he puts the camera. Again, Osment shines in his portrayal of this Mecha boy, because it is quite well-depicted and he manages to not blinking in any moment, which must be something hard, I think, and the same for Jude Law.<BR>This movie also has some beautiful scenes, for example, in which we see Osment falling silently to the sea. However, there is too much feeling inside, too much love which sometimes can be ridiculous and childish. The real end is when he gets frozen,the rest with the aliens is stupid and boring
1881273156|1.0|Is this supposed to be a &quot;Christian&quot; book?  The bible clearly defines marriage roles:  Christ is the head of the husband, the husband is the head of the wife, and the wife is to submit to her husband.  If every couple did this, there would be no divorce.  It doesn't matter which love language you speak, if you are in rebellion to the Lord and refuse to take the role you were created to fulfill, you will not have a happy marriage.  This is a scary book that will put band aids on a lot of miserable situations.  If you want to know how to fix your marriage, read the book of Ephesians.  Stop being so emotional and take some responsibility for yourself!
6305807086|5.0|Despite all you can think about  the strange cover, in which there are many people disguised with a mask of John Malkovich, you should take a look before you put it where it belongs. <BR>This movie goes by small dark places. It has a promising beginning: John Cusack starring in as a puppeteer with little money looking for a job. He has no children and has lost all the interest in his wife (Cameron Diaz). He starts working in the \\"seventh and a half\\" floor of an enterprise. This is placed between the seventh and the eighth floor and it's only 1,5 metres high, so he has to pull down the head to walk in all the time. One day he meets a beautiful woman at work (Catherine Keener) and he tries to attract her attention, but she ignores him. The things start to change when he discovers a secret door where he finds the power of  being able to see with John Malkovich`s eyes. However, this ability lasts only fifteen minutes and then, John Cusack falls in the outskirts of the city. He immediately tells all the story to that woman. At first, she doesn't care much, but she calls him on the phone later. Her idea is to write an advertisement in the newspaper and start a business: let people being Malkovich for a while after earning a lot of money. Everything is right then, but  it happens that Cusack's wife uses it when the other woman is meeting John Malkovich. They have a relationship, and it results that she is not making love to him, but to her, in fact. Malkovich realizes that he's not able to control his body.<BR>The script couldn't be better, I mean, how can you imagine someone living in John Malkovich's brain? How can you imagine the funny idea of working in a \\"seventh and a half flat\\" and such a stupid story of how it became like that?<BR>Another good thing in the movie are the actors. John Cusack's performance and Catherine Keener's are excellent; Cameron Diaz's character is well-depicted, although it's a bit strange to watch her acting in a movie like this, and John Malkovich doesn't really act, because the movie deals about this person, but he shows himself as an interesting and mysterious man, and I think that is the reason of why so many people want to be him. I found fantastic the scene in which he enters the secret door, and what surprise when he discovers a world dwelt by hundreds of copies of himself!<BR>This is a movie you can't stop watching, and it's worth doing it several more times. I wait impatiently the next Spike Jonze's challenge.

Staley's vocals could be eerily haunting, yet brash at the same time.  Cantrell's guitar work is the best of his career.  This album is Chains at the top of their game.

B00003CWTI|5.0|This movie deals about some aspects of the life of ten people. At first, they have nothing in common. However, each person has a story behind and a different way of seeing the world. They all have made mistakes in their life, as you will see. Some want to be forgiven, others need a helping hand and there are some who just leave themselves to chance. Everyone has a conflict. <BR>Tom Cruise shines in the excellent portrayal of a tough guy who teaches in the \\"Seduce and Destroy\\" meeting how to tame women, but he will have problems which have something to do with his family. Here it is his father (Jason Robards), dying of cancer, who has a nurse looking after him, and a sorrowful wife (Julianne Moore). On the other hand, we have a man introducing a quiz show on TV. He also has cancer, and his relationship with his daughter is no good because he touched her badly when she was a child. Now she takes drugs all the time and is miserable, but one day a police officer will come to her apartment because she listens to music with a high volume level. He falls in love with her at first sight and he will ask her for a date after having a long conversation. Another man (William H. Macy) will meet this police officer. He is obsessed with getting braces, but has little money and is in love with a guy, a bartender who doesn't care. Finally, there is a little and so smart child that goes to the quiz show, but he disappoints his father because he pissed his pants and doesn't dare to go to the \\"one on one\\" test in which he has to leave the table.<BR>The movie develops everyone's personality and it lasts three hours, but it's worth watching it at once and again, and again, because you feel so carried away by all the stories that you suddenly feel like one of them. This movie has an important moral teaching, I think, and I'm still trying to understand the meaning of the frogs raining from the sky. Besides, Paul Thomas Anderson's work is really good, because of the way he links one story with another, and the technical camera movements to make it possible,  and its soundtrack. The soundtrack of the movie is really good, above all, I liked a lot the Aimee Mann's songs. They bring you near all these lives. I love the scene in which all of them sing a song of her at the same time. For all this, I highly recommend this DVD.
B000002WYT|5.0|this cd from dave mathews band, in my mind, has taken the number one place. this cd has so many different levels and has something for everyone to personally connect to. from feel good music that makes you want to get up and dance, to beautiful heartfelt songs that want to make you cry. i seem to always find this cd in my cd player on repeat; it never gets old and sounds better every time.

If you are upset with something and want to cry and vent, this is your cd. The album is split with music to just listen and relax to, others are pump up music. But all of Avril's songs are ones that you can sing along and scream too. This is the best music that is out there today! She's not fake or phony and this album proves it!
0142800031|4.0|I typically steer away from war stories because they simply don't interest me.  In addition, I'm not too familiar with K. Follett's works.  But based upon some of the positive reviews, I decided to try this book.  I'm glad I did.  It was a pretty good and involved story.  <br />First let me say, the first few chapters or so of the book were pretty hard for me to get into.  A few times, I started to just give up, but I persisted and persistence paid off.  If you can make it past the first few chapters -- which are setting up the story so that you understand actions and motivations that will follow -- than you're in for a good read.<br />The plot.  The plot is good.  The setting is war times -- just before D-Day, and the place is France.  A British female spy, Flick, is charged with a mission that must be carried out, despite the costs, in order to cripple the German's war efforts.  Flick puts together a team of women that must help her get the job done.  Unfortunately, the team needs a lot of work before they're capable of doing anything besides fainting or crying at the sight of a gun.  The odds of a successful mission don't look good. Once the team is established, what follows is a story that quickly moves ever closer to their ultimate goal -- fulfilling their mission -- while at the same time, providing you with an interesting glimpse of their lives and in some cases, loves.  Yes, there's some romance, both on the German side and the British side of the story.  While this is not a romance novel, the romance just seems to fit and is quite appropriate since it helps to tell the story of the women's lives and adds depth.  Because of this, the characters come alive in the story and you'll understand the turmoil that Flick feels as she makes some of the hard decisions that she has to make.<br />The authors descriptions of setting helps too.  I was easily able to &quot;slip&quot; into the time frame of the story and see the events as they occurred.  Everything isn't wine and roses.  I mean, this IS war and bad things happen to good people.  Hopefully you're not squeamish because you'll be &quot;there&quot; as those bad things happen.  Fortunately though, good things happen to good people too, and you'll be there as well.  <br />The story is filled with suspense, danger, and a good bit of action.  You'll feel as if you want to run, duck or hide along with the characters.  All of the action isn't running, shooting, etc. kind of action, but it is action that keeps the story moving forward at a pretty nice pace.  And yes, some of it is nail-biting action.  <br />The dialog is good and appropriate.  Nothing said or done sounds phony or contrived just to move the story forward.  It fits. <br />I'm not a historian or a war buff, so while this story is based on a true story, if anything said or done is inaccurate, I wouldn't know, nor would I care.  I wanted to be entertained and the book succeeded in that respect.<br />Bottom line, I would recommend this book even if you, like me, typically do not read war stories.  Yes, the war is the reason and background for the story, but the focus is the characters and their actions, and that adds up to a very good read.
078322608X|3.0|This film is very much a Terry Gilliam vehicle, as his fans will easily discern upon watching this film. Apocalyptic and dark, yet visionary, the film is trademark Gilliam, with dreary, depressing sets. It is sci-fi with a time travel twist.<br /><br />The year is 2035, and the future of mankind seems grim and forbidding, as the human race is relegated to living underground, never seeing the light of day, after a killer virus has decimated its ranks. James Cole (Bruce Willis), a designated criminal, volunteers to travel into the past to obtain a sample of the virus that became a killing machine, in hopes of helping scientists discover a cure, as well as getting a pardon for his supposed crimes.<br /><br />Cole has little information with which to work. All he knows is that in 1996 he is to search for a radical group called, \\"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys\\". In some way, that group is affiliated with the deadly virus. How, why, or where are questions for which he must find the answers. Like searching for a needle in a haystack, Cole tries to piece the answers together, while trying to separate fantasy from reality. He finds it increasingly difficult to do so, as time travel begins to take a toll on him, given its erratic peculiarities.<br /><br />In his travels, he comes across the seriously disturbed Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who seems to have something to do with that for which Cole is looking. Jeffrey also happens to be the son of a scientist, Dr. Leland Goines (Christopher Plummer). Cole, mistaken for being mentally ill when he reveals his mission, comes under the care of psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Reilly (Madeleine Stowe). All of these individuals are, in some way, intertwined with his mission, but not in the way he may have originally thought. How much the past is a part of the future, and how much the future is a part of the past, is a question that the viewer must divine.<br /><br />Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance, taut and well nuanced. Madeleine Stowe is compelling as the initially doubting doctor, who later becomes a believer of Cole's apocalyptic message. The always urbane Christopher Plummer is also excellent as the scientific genius and father to the  troubled Jeffrey. It is Brad Pitt, however, who steals the show as the mentally unbalanced Jeffrey Goines, giving a virtuoso performance that won him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />This film was a difficult one for me to rate, being torn between awarding it three or four stars. I finally ended up awarding it three stars. While I liked the film, I found it to be too dark and depressing for my tastes. If you are a big fan of Terry Gilliam, however, add one star to my rating.e Stowe is compelling as the initially doubting doctor, who later becomes a believer of Cole's apocalyptic message.

1587990717|5.0|This is not an academic book, not a textbook on statistics and certainly not an investment book. It is a very personal essay by someone who does not seem to take authority too seriously (including himself). Aside from Soros, Popper, and Hume he has no gods and tends to overtly despise other people's gods. Sometimes he goes too far, as he does with Hegel, Will, the Wall Street CEOs, etc. <BR>This book is very very readable. I read it in almost one sitting.<BR>I find it autobiographical not egocentric. But I also find it at times scathing. <BR>Taleb is extremely opinionated, certainly not someone I would like to have as a boss. But he keeps taking jabs at himself. That is courageous. <BR>I bought and distributed 20 copies of the book.
B0000025D0|4.0|A Springsteen classic, but not in the larger pop/rock world. Two other Springsteen albums have that honor, Born to Run and Born in the USA.  Darkness is an important album because the characters  that inhabit Born to Run, trying to find a place &quot;to walk in the sun&quot; wind up working in auto shops (Promised Land), racing cars (Racing in the Streets), driving aimlessly (Something in the Night).  The romantic notions of Born to Run give way to life's realities and Springsteen starkly portrays them musically and lyrically. The characters find out it is not so simple as to want to runaway and live happily ever after, but they discover that they have to fight for their hope and faith (Badlands).
0553260111|3.0|My best friend recommended The Bourne Identity to me fifteen years ago.  I should have read it then.  My French would have been fresher.  When I purchased this book, I did not realize that both French and German languages accompanied the English.  While the passages in foreign languages are very short, usually no more than one sentence, it is sometimes not clear from the context what is being said.  One passage, perhaps the longest in French, comes at an essential point in the story.  I did not follow the French - my high school French class was fifteen years ago.  About 50 pages later, the passage is explained.  While one need not be fluent in French and German to enjoy this novel, some familiarity with French would be helpful.  The amount written in German is much less.  In all, the story can probably be enjoyed by someone with no knowledge of French or German.  <br />The other reviews tell you plenty about the plot.  Suffice it to say Ludlum is a master storyteller.  Story-weaver would be more fitting.  This book has more twists and turns than a bowl full of spaghetti.  If I were a faster reader, I would not have been able to put it down.  This book is now the standard by which I judge the ability of other writers.  I would dare say that Trevanian, Clancy, and Deighton, do not write as engagingly as Ludlum.  He consistently hooked me at the beginning and ending of every chapter.  I was compelled to read further, to find out who Jason Bourne really was, why he knew the things he knew and did not know the things he did not know.  Where there some slow points?  Yes, but well written.  Does Ludlum repeat some things during the story?  Yes, but only in Bourne's attempt to unravel the mystery for himself.  Some reviewers felt it was over done.  I felt it added to the intensity, the urgency, of Bourne's dilemma.  <br />I will also add that his is one of the few novels that I have read that evoked a good number of emotional responses from me.  Particularly in the first section of the book, I was quite put off by Bourne and the things he would do to stay alive.  He was ruthlessly cruel, but develops into a character who is not bloodthirsty, rather selective in directing his undivided attention at people.  <br />Two other comments... <BR>...I thought the profanity used in this book was a bit much.  It is no Pulp Fiction, but the cursing was pretty heavy.  Were it not for the profanity, I would give this book five stars, three instead.  <BR>...On a technical note, unless I'm greatly mistaken, you cannot use a silencer on a revolver as Ludlum tells us several characters do.  <br />In the end, I have a feeling that anyone who likes adventure, mystery, and spy-craft genre novels will enjoy this book.  I wonder now why I waited 15 years to read it.  Oh, because they finally made a movie out of it (which I am certain cannot hold a candle to the book - movies never can).

0385486804|5.0|Have you ever heard the old saying, \\"The things we own tend to end up owning us.\\"?  Have you ever felt like selling everything you own, buying a Harley and taking off for places unknown to take life head-on and enjoy whatever comes your way?  If you have, then you too will have something to relate to Christopher McCandless.  <br />Krakauer provides us with a wonderfully well researched look into what drove this young man to turn his back on society and strike out to make his own way through life.  I certainly can't fault Christopher for feeling the way he did and unlike some who have read this book, I don't think he had a death wish.  He was a little too quick and a little too determined to get away from everything and make it on his own.  I really appreciated the understanding that Krakauer provides in this book and relates his own reckless experiences.  This book shows us the true passion of youth and the sad tragedy of the death of a truly adventurous soul.

0316548189|5.0|I am in awe at the personal sacrifice and selflessness of this truly amazing man.  This book shows us what it truly means to be committed to a belief and to have the strength to endure in the face of adversity that thankfully, many of us will never have to endure.  Madiba shows us in amazing detail the history of South Africa and the fight that he and so many others endured for basic civil rights and equality.    This book is not only a great history lesson, but an amazing story of survival and perserverance.  Mandela tells his story, the story of his people and his country with such detail and such emotion that you can't help but truly admire this pillar of a man.  I highly recommend everyone read this book.

B00005JKQZ|4.0|A Beautiful Mind is far from a great film. But is it Oscar worthy? You bet.<BR>     Russell Crowe plays John Nash, a genius mathematician whose mission is to find a \\"truly original\\" idea. He does, and eventually wins a Nobel Prize for it. However, the road to winning the Nobel is bumpy and he is forced to battle several real and imagined demons along the way; schizophrenia being one of them.<BR>      In Princeton his fellow students aren't very fond of him. Nash is a recluse who lives most of his life alone, a man plagued with \\"two helpings of brain and half a helping of heart.\\"   <BR>     The acting in this film is simply phenomenal. Most actors covet the role of a madman. They can exaggerate their body language, run around naked, talk in weird tones, and generally have a ball. Sometimes they even get awards for it, like Geoffrey Rush in Shine or Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. <BR>      Crowe is too smart of an actor to fall into this trap. He portrays schizophrenia for what it is: a horrible disease. His acting is extremely subtle. It's often difficult to differentiate between moments of insanity and Nash's genuine genius. <BR>     Jennifer Connelly plays Nash's wife Alicia. After her unforgettable performance in Requiem For A Dream, she too, does an excellent job of expressing Alicia's strength as well as her vulnerability. <BR>     While the story is ultimately Nash's, Connelly doesn't allow the Alicia to be just \\"there.\\" Instead, the viewer is allowed to understand Alicia's dramatic influence on Nash. <BR>     And, oddly enough, the pairing of Ron Howard, a director widely known for sugarcoating even the darkest material, working with Russell Crowe, an actor known for collaborating with directors who portray the harsh realities of the world seemed strange at first.<BR>      For the most part, A Beautiful Mind works very well. There's a \\"twist\\" in the middle of the film that renews the viewers interest, and forces the viewer to question everything they learned about Nash.<BR>      Unfortunately the third act prevents the movie from becoming great. Howard takes the easy route and succumbs to the typical Hollywood formula. Instead exposing the real outcomes of Nash's life (for example he later divorced Alicia), Howard simply tells a story that's been done to death: love overcoming all obstacles.

0790729652|5.0|The journey of the Dark Knight from comic book to screen saw director Tim Burton ditch the campy 60s \\"KAPOW!\\" action and outrageous villians and go much deeper and darker. The auter who gave the world Beetlejuice (1988) again does things very different. But it works very well. This is still the best in the series, with all the key players working to their very best. Michael Keaton IS Batman, evoking the same troubled character from the DC comics, and of course, Jack Nicholson as The Joker, a great character played brilliantly. Burton, master of the bizzare, was the perfect man to bring the legendary comic book to the screen, and he does it wonderfully. Danny Elfman's excellent score is another added plus, and the action, while not Burton's strong point, is expertley done. The look of Gotham City is inventive and fascinating, creating a nuance of comic book-styled-action and dark storytelling. All this blends perfectly to create one of the best comic book movies of all time.
6302636779|5.0|Audrey Hepburn's performance in &quot;The Nun's Story&quot; is simply terrific!  Her portrayal of Sister Luke exposes the struggles  that a nun endures when she is totally dedicated to her religious life.  Audrey shows how Sister Luke must come to a decision that no other nun would choose to make for herself.  This is a must-see video for anyone who enjoys exceptional religious drama.  Audrey Hepburn's grace and talent makes this movie a masterpiece.
0790731002|3.0|Joel Schumacher took the helm from Tim Burton for the third Batman film, which, while it has it's flaws, is still a solid entry into the Batman franchise. Val Kilmer takes over the role of Bruce Wayne, and while he's not as good as Michael Keaton, he manages to portray the character well. Joining Kilmer is Chris O'Donnell as Robin, and the bad guys; Tommy Lee Jones as the disfigured &quot;Two Face&quot; and the suitably manic Jim Carrey as the crazed Riddler.<br />The story is the first to properly explore the history of Batman and his troubled psyche. The action is well-played and inventive, far beyond the first two films. The bad guy duo of Jones and Carrey works suprisingly well, with one-liners bouncing off each other, and there's even a nice referance to Batman's previous outing: &quot;You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?&quot; The suppourting cast of Pat Hingle and Michael Gough bring gravitas to their roles and Nicole Kidman and Drew Barrymore provide the eye candy. William Goldenthal's exciting score moves away from the spookiness of Danny Elfman's music. Batman's Batmobile is the best one in the films, and with the Batwing and Batboat, the Dark Knight is ready for action!<br />There are problems; the action takes over most of the time, leaving little in the way of exposition or plot for that matter. And the vertigo-inducing camera angles and frenetic pacing leaves the audience wanting something perhaps a little more grounded. But Gotham City's stylised look is impressive, taking the gothic look from Batman Returns and futhering the idea with giant sculptures and towering skyscrapers, which adds to the comic-book appearance. Unfortunatly, the sometimes campy feel to the film lead the way for Schumacher's gaudy follow-up, Batman and Robin.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|I knew the American Showtime version of the British program and am an admitted addict.  While it took me a bit to catch on to it (I was put off by the sex, which seemed sort of soft core porn initially) I am completely under it's spell.  The Showtime version is on hiatus for the summer and I was feeling withdrawl symptoms and went mad and just ordered the original British series plus the movie (part 2).  Did I like it?  Well, yes.  The first package (part one) is exactly the same story line as the American version.  Same story but different attitude.  It sees the story from a very different perspective.  While I found this a trifle disconcerting at first, I at last settled into it and went with the flow.  Of course this is a much shorter verson (6 hours) and so it cannot by it's nature be an ongoing story.  Once I was reconciled to the differences, I loved it.  The story, as I have said, is the same and we have the same characters......but they are different.  Nathan (Justin in the Showtime program) loves Stuart but is not immobilized by it (he is also 15!  Yikes).  He is a force of nature and not the least bit as single minded about Stuart (Brian) as his American counterpart.  Vince (Michael) is a bit more inept in all respects, but just as loveable and endearing.  And Stuart is the most disappointing and also, somehow, the most refreshing change from the Showtime character.  His motives are more obvious and his reactions more predictable.  But eventually, I ended up loving Stuart.  DVD 2 is a revelation.  A complete departure from the American version, this wraps up the whole thing.  There can really be no more QAF (this version), and you wouldn't want it after this finish,  The conclusion was masterful.  Concentrating on the love Stuart (Brian) and Vince (Michael) have for one another, it explores areas the Showtime series has pretty much abandoned.  I LOVED IT.  Bravo.  Check it out.  You will not be sorry.
B00005J6UP|5.0|One of my favorite movies from the 80's!  I was only 4 when it came out and I loved it the first time I saw it....
0790729393|1.0|Most people only write reviews of movies they really like.  But for this movie, I disliked it so much, I felt the need to warn others before they decide what they want to rent.<br />How do you make a movie about pedophilia boring?  Ask Berry Levinson.  Of course, if I'd have known he directed it, I wouldn't have rented it, because I've hated all his movies.  All his movies have the following problems, including Sleepers:<br />-Inappropriately happy 60's music blaring during most of the film.<br />-Unbelievable \\"pranks\\" that make you doubt the story and the story teller.<br />-Long boring scenes that go nowhere and don't seem to have a purpose.<br />-People with obnoxiously fake New York accents.<br />-All the women are merely objects or props for the \\"cool\\" males to play with.<br />The only redeeming quality to this film was that Brad Renfro was in it.
6305358613|5.0|This film quickly became on of my very favorites. It clearly falls within the genre of costume drama, but manages to portray the intrigues of the period in sufficiently byzantine fashion as to keep the viewer riveted and in suspense DESPITE the fact that all of us know Elizabeth \\"wins\\" in the end. <br />Cate Blanchett is truly one amazing actress, and demonstrates an incredible range of emotion in what must have been a very difficult part to play. She cleverly reflects Elizabeth, threatened by her fanatical and mad sister, Bloody Mary. During this interview with the dying queen, Blanchett reflects terror, integrity and apprehension at the death warrant in her sister's hands, while at the same time showing a calculating ambition and desire for the throne using her eyes alone. During the early days of Elizabeth's reign, we see a queen who is incredibly inexperienced and niaive, but at the same time Blanchett's performance laces that character with steel, such that her emergence in later days as a iron fist does not seem a sudden and unbelievable transition minus the velvet. Her Walsingham, played to perfection by Geoffrey Rush, seems written 1/3 historical character, 1/3 John Dee, and 1/3 Nicolo Machiavelli. This must be the finest performance of Rush's career to date, and there is some contest as to whether he, or Blanchett, truly dominates this film. Fanny Ardant, playing Mary of Guise with vile yet sweet seductiveness as only she can, is another powerful performance, despite her limited time on the screen in the film. Kathy Burke's mad Queen Mary is vilely terrifying in her Catholic devotion and desire to eradicate the protestant threat, and the comedienne shows herself made of greater stuff than past given credit for. There are some disappointing performances. Christopher Eccleston's Duke Norfolk lacks depth, coming over as a smug bully without the mental agility to perform the political feats we see him accomplish in the film. Joseph Fiennes, one of the most overrated of actors, again shows his ability to portray emotion limited exclusively to eyebrows and facial expressions. Im not sure whether the role was written with \\"cute, cocky toy-boy\\" in mind, but as this is all that J. Fiennes seems capable of, its what you see. <br />What is truly amazing about this film is the fact that, despite an almost total lack of \\"action\\" until the last few minutes, and the fact that it focuses on plots, counter-plots, intrigues and counter-intrigues, it still more than manages to keep the viewer engrossed and rivetted. Yes, historical events were modified to make the film more engrossing (the \\"bloodbath\\" at the end actually took decades to complete, and many of those \\"removed\\" were done so through exile, rather than assassination/execution). However, the film relies substantially on the ability of its performers to carry the effect off, and Rush/Blanchett and others do this with magnificent grace and eloquence. These performances manage to keep you mentally engaged throughout.<br />Bearing in mind that Elizabeth has been synonamous with Glenda Jackson in most minds, it is great to finally have a performance by yet another brilliant actress which not only compares favorably, but perhaps supercedes that of Dame Jackson in the role.
B00005YTFG|5.0|Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge is one of the most beautifully shot and written musical ever.  Not one moment is wasted.  There is one such moment that is wonderful.  The scene involves a song, a magnificently choreagraphed dance sequence, and is intercut with scenes from the interlocking stories.  The love between Satine and Christian is believable and you end up cheering for their love.  Nicole Kidman plays Satine so well it ends up being one of her best performances ever.  Not to mention the fact that she looks incredible.  Ewan McGregor as Christian seems like a good way to go.  He also does a great job.  Richard Roxburgh plays the evil Duke, and will do anything for the love of Satine even murder.  The movies ending is touching and sad.  This is a great movie.
6300215512|1.0|Sorry,but I do not see what would make this movie 5 stars. It was creepy, and the whole time I thought, &quot;Should I be laughing or taking this seriously?&quot; It was just too weird and unbelievable. The thought of Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis actually having a relationship is difficult and even painful to think about. Thankfully this film was made in a time where the romantic interludes were kindly left to the viewers imagination. I forced myself to imagine that there actually was nothing physical between them; that way I could get through the movie.<br />I guess I don't deal well with such dark films. The only thing I liked about it was Gillis' narration. Overall, I felt both the lead characters too strange to relate too or to understand. I cannot recommend watching this film, except to watch it as an example of Hollywood at its extreme weirdest.
B0000640SB|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. There had to of been a couple of raised eyebrows when people first heard of this big screen pairing. What will these two be like together?. Some might've thought it was a recipe for disaster. On the contrary. Jones and Smith clicked. They just melted together like butter. Sure the effects and make-up and all that was fun and well done, but it's the on screen chemistry of this new duo that makes this film the fun it is. Director Barry Sonnenfeld(The Addams Family movies, Get Shorty, Big Trouble)directs this highly entertaining summer movie that is one heck of a pleasing journey. Will Smith plays a rookie cop who is recruited by the MIB to work opposite Agent K(Jones)to keep track of aliens on earth. Their main adversary here is an alien who has inhabited the body of a farmer, played hysterically by Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio is quite incredible as the human taken over by the alien. The skin doesn't fit right and he is rapidly decaying. Gross and funny. Rip Torn is on hand as the leader of the MIB group. Linda Fiorentino shows up as well as Dr. Laurel Weaver. Another familiar face here is Tony Shalhoub(\\"Wings\\", \\"Thirteen Ghosts\\", \\"Big Night\\")as an alien passing as a human. Smith and Jones know better. The make-up is very good. The effects are satisfying. The movie moves along at a nice rate where there isn't much time for the film to slag, or the audience to wander off. It's brisk and enjoyable. This is a film that could almost of been directed by Tim Burton. Burton's longtime composer, and musical genius, Danny Elfman, composed the movie with the great kind of score we come to expect from him. Again, this movie really lies in the hands of Jones and Smith. They deliver some great comic moments. It just comes across as very natural. It's nice to see the notoriously serious Tommy Lee do something funny. \\"Men In Black II\\" looks like it will uphold the tradition of this first film too. I hope it can keep the same kind of fun/cool of thisone. That's what this movie and others like it are for. They are not here to be overly analyzed and taken seriously. Look at some of the more harsher reviews and you'll know what I mean. You have to go to a summery like popcorn movie and know that you are seeing a summery popcorn movie. It can be a good, intelligent, well done movie without having some Oscar-worthy plot. You gotta know that going in. Anyways, this is a fun treat for anyone who likes fun entertainment. Who doesn't?.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spiderman is a movie that has been needed to be made for years. This movie starts out when Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) goes to a spider exhibit where they have eight spiders that have the abilties of hundreds of spiders. One accidentally gets out of its cage and bites Peter. He soon learns he has the abilties of a spider. At first he uses his powers to wrestle for money and when he wins they only give him half of what he should have gotten. He becomes angry with them and on his way out a burgler had  stolen money from the register of the tournament's office and Peter did not stop him. But in a weird twist of events this burgler kills someone very dear to him. It is then Peter decides to use his powers to fight evil. This movie has a sequel coming out in two years and is worthy of many more. This movie is truly one of a kind.
B000001FN3|3.0|I loved the original LP vinyl (still have it after all these years) - however --- when I purchased the \\"remastered\\" CD, it was a shock to my ears. The \\"remastered\\" version - NO make that \\"re-did\\" version of the original it seemed strange to me. The \\"voice-overs\\", added guitar solo and other small changes made it seem like a new experience. Don't get me wrong - the CD quality is great (compared to my used-up record). However, If you can - get a hold of a original LP version to hear it the way it was meant to be and should have been left as.
6304711905|5.0|This movie is sure to be a classic. A great action-adventure with an outstanding cast. It depicts Wyatt Earp and his family and friends. Its a great story of love, friendship and loyalty. In my opinion one of the greatest western films.
B00005B6N7|4.0|A great storyline and edge-of-your-seat action and suspense make U-571 a great military thriller that should not be missed by anyone. The storyline concerns a group of soldiers who embark on a dangerous submarine mission. Their mission being to capture a German Enigma sub in order to recover and decode German documents, is what makes the action satisfyingly suspenseful. This film does not sacrifice story for action, as is the case with most other films. Therefore, it is my opinion that U-571 is among my favorite films. The missing star is due to the soundtrack of the film; I would not reccomend buying the soundtrack because of the poor musical scorethat goes with the film. But that's just my opinion. Anyway, I highly reccomend this film to anyone.
0790744759|5.0|This movie is AMAZING the opening sequence is fantasic and the ending left me with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, Judy Garland is charming and really makes the character come to life, her singing is uncomparable and my personal favourites are: The Trolley Song, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and The Boy Next Door.<br />Bremer is ok thoughshe displays no great acting ability, the father is wonderful and so is Mary Astor.  The little girl who plays Agnes really does shine in what is a limited part.  The only downside to this movie is Tootie, she comes across as nothing more than a spoilt brat who deserves a good slap, O'Brien does seem to overact but most child actors do, although 'Under The Bamboo tree' was quite good.<br />The picture is in glorious technicolour and all the scenes and costumes are so colourful.  Minnelli's direction is nothing short of genius and the use of a fuzzy lens when Garland is going dopey eyed over the boy next door is really clever.<br />Overall I would say this is the happiest most feel good film ever made [the worst thing that happens is that the soup is too sour!] and sums up the magic of 'the movie golden age'
B00005YUNY|5.0|I just got the  Newest YES DVD YESSYMPHONIC in the mail today, In fact I just got done watching it in it's entirety.   Wow!!!  This is a reflection of the bands ability to try and do new things with old material as well as there new stuff.  I did get to see this tour live but am glad I purchased this as a genuine fan and collector.  As I said in the title  \\"Yesology\\" the Continuing study of Yes Music is not only meant for the band to continue  puting out new albums and to continue touring it's a phrase for us as fans to continue to crave there music and hold it dear to us.  If you haven't seen this I highly reccomend you order it today. I will be looking forward to seeing YES as well as all the fellow YES fans This summer.  Should be another great Tour with Rick back in the band.  See Ya there.  David Jacques St.  George, UTAH

B000066NW0|5.0|Usually I become tired listening to the same artist for a week or two that it makes me neglect the album for a few days.  However, Avril Lavigne's debut album has been playing everywhere I go, and It hasn't yet urked me.  If it isn't playing, someone's singing.  If it isn't an A capella, then it's chords from a nearby acoustic guitar (tabs available online.)  I've even watched someone trying to compose a piano piece for 'Complicated' &amp; heard bands covering their music.<br />Avril's music has been labeled &quot;Skaterish... alternative... punk... softcore... pop... rock...&quot; and pretty much anything else close enough to those genre's.  Now this Napanee girl, only seventeen, has written her own lyrics and music for the world to hear.  She's been getting gig's on television talk shows along with performances in a hand full of different places.  If that's not enough to convince you that her album is worth it... then read on.<br />&quot;I'm scared.  I like chic music!&quot; said one of my main guy friends who's into hardcore punk &amp; only hardcore punk.  It's crazy... just get her album, it friggin' ROCKS.  All her songs seem to be RADIO MUSIC.  In other words... any of it would do well on the radio.  You don't get that to often.  I recommend you sample her music.  Infact, you don't even need to sample it because I'm sure you'll find it pleasing after you have purchased it.  And do please PURCHASE... when you burn an album, an artist loses money. Please support the band so they could raise enough money for tours (maybe somewhere in your area.)<br />Spread the word about Avril Lavigne...
B000066NW0|5.0|Very rarely do you find a CD that moves you, touches you, inspires you, and makes you want to scream out loud, all within a period of 49 minutes.  &quot;Let Go,&quot; the debut album from 17-year-old Canadian singer/songwriter Avril Lavigne, is one of those CD's.  Every song has the ability to reach into your heart and make you feel a million different things all at once.  The mellow &quot;I'm With You&quot; and the irresistible &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; hint at Avril's romantic side, while the punk rock sounds of &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; beg you to look beneath the surface before you judge someone.  But &quot;Let Go&quot; is neither a pop album nor a punk album.  Like the artist who sings them, every song goes beyond labels and urges you to just listen to the lyrics and feel the music, instead of worrying about what genre it fits into.  However, if you feel that you must put it into a genre, place it into a new section and call it &quot;Avril Lavigne.&quot;  Not only is the music unique enough to be put into a place all by itself, but so is the person behind the music.  When you first see Avril, you see a small, wide-eyed young girl with a guitar in her hands and a tie around her neck.  When you first hear her speak, you hear a huge amount of confidence mixed in with a bit of shyness.  However, when you first hear her sing, she suddenly turns into a young woman whose mind is focused on pain, love, and independence rather than malls and revealing clothes.  She is not concerned with sugarcoating her lyrics and making every song appeal to every listener and every critic.  She is concerned with reaching out to the people who can relate to her messages about being yourself, feeling lonely, being let down, and being in love.  On &quot;Nobody's Fool,&quot; she makes it clear that you can try all you want to change her into someone else, but there's no way that you will succeed.  As with any new singer, the comparisons between Avril and other musicians come fast and from all directions, and even though she does share some traits with other female singers, most of them don't have a collection of songs as diverse as Avril's are.

What I can tell you is that Avril writes and sings from the heart, and the end result is an album full of brilliant yet approachable lyrics and irresistible melodies.  &quot;Let Go&quot; may not be for everyone, but when it does make a connection with someone, it has the ability to inspire that person and let him or her know that it's ok to be different.  And in this day and age, that's certainly not a bad thing.from all directions, and even though she does share some traits with other female singers, most of them don't have a collection of songs as diverse as Avril's are.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|I've listened to most Dire Straits albums, and generally they leave me cold...a few good songs mixed up with throwaway rubbish...but not on this album.<br />The first six tracks are amazing in their quality and diversity...the best Straits song ever is \\"Expresso Love\\" (although it needs a sax solo - and you know where!) and \\"Tunnel Of Love\\" and \\"Skateaway\\" are not far behind. \\"Romeo And Juliet\\" and \\"Hand In Hand\\" show that Knopfler can write poignant lyrics and set them to beautiful music as well as the next man, while \\"Solid Rock\\" is more of a throwaway than the other tracks, but still great fun.<br />As for the widely derided \\"Les Boys\\"...it's very easy to stop the CD as soon as \\"Solid Rock\\" comes to an end, but I rarely find myself doing that, so it can't be that bad.

0553275976|5.0|'Bonfire of the Vanities' is a quintessential novel of the contemporary era not only for its literary craft, but also for its insight into the modern-day social system.  Wolf accurately depicts this system on all fronts.  The social interaction between economic classes, the growing problems (maybe even failure) of politics and justice as vehicles of freedom and democracy, and the powerful control of consumerism over us all are themes of the book underlying a story masterfully written from a number of the characters' perspectives.  You start to feel the strengths and weaknesses of each character, realizing how human nature and illusions of grandeur make us all into people we never thought we'd become.<br />Being a big Easton Ellis fan, I thought the descriptive writing in this book was far from excessive and only illustrated some of its themes of materialism.  It's also probably one of the fastest (substantive) 700 pages I've ever read.  Don't count on the film for anything but a good laugh.  <br />Regardless, you will be more enlightened after readiing this book.
B00003CX6P|3.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley reminded me of nothing quite so much as Ridley Scott's Hannibal. That in itself is no bad thing, for Hannibal is a terrific piece of cinema, and in any case The Talented Mr. Ripley predates Hannibal by a couple of years. It is certainly true that Hannibal borrows much from Mr. Ripley in terms of style - and for that matter, a number of the set pieces. The Opera scene; the coffee emporia, the perfume; the high-end dolce vita, counterpointed against the subject's grisly deeds - these hallmarks of Hannibal all flow thickly through Mr. Ripley.<br />Where Ridley Scott was canny, though, was in upgrading the experience from coach to first class - Hannibal's Florence is an altogether more sophisticated, more lushly shot, and better understood rendition of what is so alluring to outsiders about Italy than Ripley's equivalent. Minghella tends to punt for the familiar, picture postcard scenes, relying on obvious tourist locations (Spanish Steps, Trevisi Fountain etc) but for all that fails to capture Italy with anything like the same wit or erudition.<br />The films works very well fundamentally as a richly shot (if badly overlong) psychological thriller - in places it is as tense as to be almost un-watchable - but I'm not sure what it achieves at a more substantial level. In this regard, your two and a half hours are scantly rewarded. I had much the same reaction to The English Patient: Beautiful to look at, sweeping and epic; all very brooding and meaningful, but for what?<br />Minghella's picture has enough style and is well enough acted and directed to raise the expectation that something significant is afoot, but despite much promise, nothing (other than the thriller) materialises. For example, the Opera (and Ripley's reaction to it) seems to be building to a point of some weight, but the point is never ultimately made. Perhaps, I'll grant you, I just didn't get it - but on first viewing I was left creasing my brow. Similarly, the conclusion to the film, while carefully (painstakingly, almost) constructed, ends up being confusing and more than a little, well, inconclusive. Again, it was as if the film were on the way to the point, but never quite made it.<br />This isn't to say Minghella doesn't try: a number of figurative devices recur during the film, but mostly they are (or their execution is) clumsy: swinging, fractured mirrors, shadows and lighting dancing on faces, rippling (ha!) water fading in and out of focus, and an almost hammy explosion of disturbed pigeons every time Mr. Ripley crosses a square (Hannibal borrowed this device too, but put it to much eerier effect). All these clever cinematic devices add critically to the length of the picture, without adding to the sum total of its message.<br />These objections shouldn't detract from the fact that Mr. Ripley is a very clever, tense thriller. Jude Law turns in a terrific performance, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives an intelligent, understated, underrated portrayal of the long suffering cuckold. And while I can't bring myself to like Matt Damon, you have to admire his technical skill as an actor.the film, while carefully (painstakingly, almost) constructed, ends up being confusing and more than a little, well, inconclusive.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Those who find this movie boring, just simply don't get the nuanced brilliance of the story and the sheer mastery in the acting and directing. Just keep watching the shallow hollywood flicks you've grown accustomed to...  Gosford Park allows the viewer to be a fly on the wall during a hunting weekend which turns out to be rather tragic for all.  The relationship between the rich well to do and the servants below stairs gives us a unique peek into how it really would have been in England at the early part of the last century.  Altman transports the viewer with the lush sets and amazing costumes.  Watch the interaction between characters and be in awe of the great talent assembled to act. You won't find a better cast in any movie made in the last 30 years.
0060977264|4.0|P.Coelho typically says that we should always do what we want to do, even if our rationale advices otherwise. In the fifth mountain, Elijah struggles to fulfill his promise to god. In the alchemist the boy traverses the desert to find the alchemist. Here he has taken a unlikely relationship between a wannabe priest and a free spirited girl as a model for his philosophy.<br />It is true that we should have the free will to do what we really want to do inspite of the probability of failure in our effort. A great virtue to be cultivated by everyone with a striving to grow.
B0000640VM|4.0|Disney's 27th animated classic does suffer from the fact that it was the last feature from the studio to hit before \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" Of course this caused inevitable comparisons, and of course there is no competition between the two an any way.<br />\\"The Little Mermaid\\" is in fact a superior film, but the comparisons are unjust because each film is supposed to be very different.<br />The characters are all likable, with the exception of Tito the chiwaua who just goes over the top sometimes to the point of annoyance. The story is very contemporary, simple, and it works very well. The songs, although every 80's, are still catchy.<br />The animation in \\"Oliver & Company\\" consists of stylized backdrops of New York City and characters that seem flat and hard edged. The best older classic that you could compare it to was 1961s 101 Dalmatians. The film makers made a commendable effort in making this film feel true to it's setting, and moreover give us NYC through a dog's perspective. The film's artists actually endured strange glances from New Yorkers, as they squatted or laid down on the sidewalks to draw the city from a dog's eye level. It's also a great kick to see all the animated human characters on the streets in 80's fashions. ( O/T Seriously, what were designers thinking back then? )  The Twin Towers also make a bittersweet appearance.<br />\\"Oliver & Company\\" also was the first Disney film to extensively use computers. Whereas \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\" used computers for the impressive Big Ben sequence,  in \\"Oliver\\" the computer is used more.  The cars, the subway and many other elements are impressive uses of the new technology, which led the way for everything from The Flying Carpet in \\"Aladdin\\" to the ballroom sequence in \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\"<br />\\"Oliver & Company\\" is a fun way to kill 80 min of your time. It has many things to appreciate, it does what it was meant to do. I do not think it was meant to be a classic of Bambi-proportions. And because ofit's humble roots, I find this movie to be well worth the purchase.
0792156684|1.0|Can someone please write to me and tell me what i'm missing?  What is the attraction to this in-accurate account of what really happened?  Maybe a different name would have sparked a small interest. This is the worse piece of thrash that Hollywood has ever come up with. That kid Leonardo,,,,,is he really an actor? What is his claim to fame? I just don't get it. There is NOTHING about this film that is of redeaming value. I've seen better grammar school productions.  Sorry folks, i know i'm in the minority on this and either \\"i\\" need an attuide ajustment or the viewing public had to be on serious drugs when they saw this poorly acted,  poorly directed and new story line that had NOTHING to do with the actual title.  And what is it with special effects that turn people on? If i've said it once, i've said it a thousand times,,,if you have to have special effects in a movie, it because the acting is VERY BAD. Definate example of bad acting.  By far the WORSE Hollywood film ever!
B00005JKQZ|2.0|I knew this movie would be a disappointment, and I was right.  It left me untouched, unmoved, and failed to evoke any emotions in me.  Acting was OK.  Story and plot were weak.  Nothing much happens here.  There is very little to keep anyone awake or interested.  And yes, as many viewers point out, the whole &quot;love saves the day&quot; thing made me nauseous.  After &quot;Gladiator&quot; won Best Picture last year, I knew anything the Academy did afterwards would be utterly ridiculous.  I was right again.  This was a potentially interesting premise totally squandered by sentiment, cliche and swelling violins.  Ugh, the more I think about it, the more I don't like it.

B00005JKBC|3.0|Sadly, this kind of movie is what qualifies as a top-notch espionage thriller nowadays.  Riddled with cliches, SPY GAME benefits only from the solid performances by Redford and Pitt.  The plot is somewhat intricate though never very compelling.<br />An espionage thriller must at least be grounded in plausibility to be truly involving for the viewer, and this one never quite gets there.<br />I may be nitpicking here, but for me the movie lost some credibility in the first reel:  Rogue CIA agent Pitt enters a Chinese prison under the guise of a relief worker giving medical aid, and from there he orchestrates a prisoner rescue.  In searching the prison for his target, he spies a prisoner huddled in a corner and gives him a piece of chewing gum.  Soon after, Pitt's cover is blown when that prisoner is seen walking around blowing bubbles with the gum.  It was CHEWING gum, not BUBBLE gum.  I didn't look for a reason to nitpick -- this one just jumped out at me.<br />Most of the film is told through flashback while Redford sits in a CIA boardroom with his superiors.  But if it weren't for director Tony Scott repeatedly showing us a countdown clock to Pitt's impending execution, there would be very little sense of urgency to the proceedings.  As with many cliche-ridden plotlines, things get wrapped up a bit too conveniently and in the nick of time.<br />I don't recommend this one for purchase.  Maybe a rental, though you can easily do better with another Redford film called SNEAKERS.  SNEAKERS is sort of a domestic espionage thriller/comedy, and infinitely more entertaining and intelligent than SPY GAME.
B00005MAM2|5.0|?Whoa?<br />That?s exactly what I said after finishing the simply amazing Akira. I can?t call my self a hardcore fan because I haven?t even seen the original. But I don?t want to. I?ve decided that the special edition is perfect. Therefore it?s impossible to watch anything better so I?ll stick to watching the special addition.<br />Based on Katsuhiro Otomo?s 2,000 page graphic novel ( which is even better than the movie ) Akira follows Tetsuo, a teenager who lives in the slums of neo-tokyo. He comes in contact with a telepathic child. Soon he becomes telepathic too. But he becomes very powerful. As powerful as Akira. But can his body handle that kind of power?
0385503954|5.0|This is the story of a lie told by a young girl, a lie that is seemingly more the product of an adolescent and hyperactive imagination rather than any malice or enmity of heart. The story tells of the momentous and lasting impact of this lie on the life of a young man whose life from his childhood has been linked to the family of this young girl and has become romantically and tragically linked to a particular member of this family only by a mere few hours before the lie is actually uttered. Altogether there are three separate strands to this novel, each in its own right captivating the reader's attention, parts that are finally twined together in an epilogue, that though brief by comparison to the other parts of the novel serves its purpose well. As to the quality of the writing this is undeniably that of a seasoned master sensitive to the magical qualities inherent within the written word and the manifold ways in which both reality and imagination can be captured and pictured on the page so as to eventually be relived by the reader. I would recommend this novel without hesitation to any person who is willing to follow and partake in the experience of the characters trapped within a situation that is simultaneously utterly convincing yet captivatingly removed far beyond the daily reality of most of people living today about 60 years after the events that are described within the novel actually occurred.

The very good chemistry between Robert Preston [Prof. Harold Hill] and Shirley Jones [Marian Paroo] was great.  The addition of Buddy Hacket as the Professor's old partner Marcellus Washburn added to the friendliness of the movie.

B00005KHJM|4.0|This film has one basic fault. It's too short. <br />  That's not the fault of the writer or director, but the studio that hacked the film to pieces. A limited edition exists which contains both the shorter version (like this one) and the full-length version that the movie was intended to be.<br />  Oddly enough, the thing that the Wicker Man most reminds me of is not the many British horror films of the late 1960s and early 1970s -- it's the cult-TV series The Prisoner. Both take place in strange, isolated communities with a mounting sense of paranoia ... and playfulness.<br />  There's a lot of humour to be had in the film. And terror.<br />  Visually, it's just perfect... Summerisle looks as well as the opening dedication would suggest it is. And Christopher Lee proves once again why is the master.<br />  It's a smart, educated and clever film.<br />  Oh, and the songs are especially good. I'd love a copy of \\"Corn Rigs\\" and \\"There was a tree...\\"<BR>  So, is it a horror film or not? Who knows? Who cares? It's an entertaining way to spend an hour and half (or more if you get the longer version).<br />  The DVD comes with an informative documentary The Wicker Man Enigma.

0780628551|2.0|Charlize Theron is a concerned wife who believes her astronaut husband (Johnny Depp) isn't quite himself after a mysterious accident in outer space.  Paranoid, Roman Polanski-style thriller moves at an incredibly slow pace, rambles on predictably, and concludes with an obvious, Outer Limits-type ending.  This is most notable for featuring Clea Duvall, which makes it three films the actress has been in where people are possessed by extraterrestrials (the other two being The Faculty and Ghosts of Mars).<BR>* 1/2 out of *****

B000002H33|5.0|I bought the whole Metallica collection starting with 'Reload' which I still like but hardly listen to. Of course the reason for this is that I bought the early albums later and I must agree with Metallica fans-they are much better. 'Ride the lightning' and 'Master of puppets' are done with such high input of energy and passion the later albums could never reach though James' voice is much better now.<br />Sometimes you can complain there are only 8 tracks on the album but in this case I gotta say quality instead of quantity. The songs are well structured, Cliff Burton and Kirk Hammett make 'Orion' and 'Master of Puppets' into real classics. The other songs are great, especially 'Welcome Home(Sanitarium)' which makes up what I appreciate on the early Metallica work: beautiful melodies, honestly sung vocals put over [rear]-kicking guitar riffs. James' lyrics on 'Disposable Heroes' criticize the war and are very actual nowadays, well and seriously written. Of course it's not just the lyrics I love about this song.<br />'Master of puppets' contains some fresh music which'll never be forgotten, especially regarding the number of reviews at amazon. On this one you easily hear what most of today's metal bands lack.
B000063S6Z|3.0|I'll be brief, this was somewhat dissappointing. I knew in someways this was going to be similar to Play. But, I was hoping not this similar. 70% of the tracks from 18 are alternate versions of songs from Play, which was a unique and grand album. Sadly Moby's seeming passive additude would suggest he nonchalontly pieced this together.
0767805712|5.0|I have ignored this film since its release few years ago. This film came to my attention only when it was voted the 2nd best science fiction movie of all time in Wired Magazine recently. Although I had some doubts then, but I decided to give it a try on DVD since the film is considered better than Star Wars,2001 and The Matrix by Wired Magazine. Wow! I have now realised what I have been missing. The film is intelligent and uplifting, the acting is superb(especially Jude Law)and the music score is beautiful, simply one of the best in recent memory. <br />Andrew Niccol did a great job directing. It is one of those rare gems that are much rewarded by subsequent viewings and it stirs those feelings everyone has -\\"Am I good enough?\\",\\"Could I be better at what I do?\\",\\"A person is good at what he/she does because of genetic makeup or the effort put in?\\" For most viewers, this is indeed a deeply provocative and breathtaking film, cumulating in a bitter-sweet ending that lingers around long after the credits end.<br />I shall say no more, anybody that has not watched GATTACA should go and see it immediately. Highly recommended.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Based on a beloved Chinese legend, Mulan is a lovely, spirited, intelligent, outspoken, but less than graceful young girl growing up in ancient China. She has come of age, and it is time to be married off to a young man, but the village matchmaker does not believe it is possible. Speaking openly, even to men, and having poor serving skills, Mulan is simply not a proper young Chinese woman and will never bring her family honor. Her despair over dishonoring her family and her desire to freely embrace her true self must be cast aside, however, when the Emperor calls out for one male member of each Chinese family to join the army and help defend the land from the invading Huns. With her father too weak to last long in military service, Mulan is the only member of her family who is able to fight, but a woman joining the army is forbidden, and the penalty of deception is death! After she makes the dangerous decision to disguise herself as a man and fight in her father's place, Mulan's ancestors send a mighty dragon to bring her back before she causes her family further shame and embarrassment. But Mushu (Eddie Murphy), a much more miniscule dragon, takes his place and decides to help Mulan in her quest instead of bringing her home. In her guise as a male soldier, Mulan barely manages to keep her secret while training, marching, and fighting, but by the time her struggle is over, Mulan and those around her learn that she doesn't have to be a perfect bride or beauty to bring her family of honor.<br /><br />There's a lot of animosity towards the Disney animated features that have been released since \\"The Lion King.\\" Many have said that \\"The Lion King\\" was the last great film of the Disney Renaissance that supposedly started with \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" Not at all true. \\"Mulan\\" is a prime example. The story is powerful, emotional, and more real than anything Disney feature animation has tackled before, except maybe \\"Pocahontas.\\" The film envelopes you in ancient Chinese culture, the music is fantastic, and the characters are believable, endearing, and beautifully played by their respective voice talents. Eddie Murphy, of course, is the big name tagged to this feature, playing a role that he seemed to be reprising in Shrek (but he's much funnier here). Much of the rest of the cast list reads like a Who's Who of Asian-American actors, from Pat Morita to James Hong, with the beautiful Ming-Na Wen as Mulan herself. And, while there IS a clear villain, the ferociously looming and eventually realized threat of Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army of Huns, the real conflict in this film is Mulan's struggle to discover herself and to prove her worth to her family, her people, and to herself.<br /><br />This 2-disc Special Edition does a nice job stepping things up from the previous Gold Collection release.

This time, Raven sings \\"True To Your Heart\\" off the \\"Disneymania 2\\" CD. Now, I know we all get annoyed when Disney tries to pass a commercial off as legitimate art, but I have to admit that I think she sings pretty good. Problem is, why don't they make an effort to do a decent video? How many recording booth videos is Disney Channel going to make?  <br /> <br />Disc 2 of the \\"Mulan\\" 2-disc Special Edition carries over the \\"Music and More\\" section for one more video. This time, we get the Spanish version of \\"Reflection,\\" sung by an uncredited vocalist whom I am informed is named Lucero. It's pretty much the same thing as the Aguilera video, but in Spanish. Sadly, there is no big \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurette on \\"Mulan,\\" which is too bad since I'm sure there was one made for the Disney Channel. They really should include those on their DVD releases. In fact, it seems that most of the \\"Backstage Disney\\" (as it is called) section extra features have been shot after the fact. We don't get to see the sort of footage we used to see in behind the scenes Disney stuff, with animators hard at work and voice actors in the recording studio. In fact, the voice cast is tragically absent from this set. Now that is a true shame. Not so much as an interview. However, there is still plenty to see and do, plus, many sections thankfully include the good ol' \\"Play All\\" button. We are offered first a section called \\"The Journey Begins,\\" which includes a look into a trip to China that the filmmakers took for inspiration and preparation, a wonderful recitation (set to artwork) of the poem the film used as a basis, and two early presentation reels. Second is the \\"Story Artists' Journey,\\" which holds a featurette of filmmakers reflecting back on the film along with storyboard to screen comparisons. Next is a favorite of mine, the \\"Design\\" section, where we get to see all those neat art galleries. I love to see all the cute artwork of Disney girls evolving into their final forms. *drool* This section also houses three featurettes on art design, character design, and color. Good stuff! The \\"Production\\" section offers progressive demonstrations, a featurette on \\"The Hun Charge\\" computer effects, and a featurette on crowd computer effects. The \\"Music\\" section simply holds a brief featurette that could have been longer, but as it is, makes point to mention one of Mulan's best attributes, only using songs that fit story purposes. The final bit of extras are in a section called \\"International Mulan.\\" There's a featurette on translating the film for the world audience, a multi-language reel, and a publicity art gallery.  <br /> <br />There are only two major blemishes to this lovely 2-disc DVD release. One is the aforementioned lack of voice cast presence among the extras. The other is the fact that there are no theatrical trailers for the film itself to be found. Even the previous Gold Collection release had a trailer. Other than that, this is an excellent release of a beautiful and touching new Disney Classic that should be in everyone's DVD library, particularly recommended for those sick of Princesses and looking for a very different type of \\"Disney Girl.\\" Myself, I'll take Mulan and the princesses too, ha! <br />
6305280762|5.0|Introspective funnyman Woody Allen as big-time action movie director??!! Scoff if u will, but THE TOWERING INFERNO remains one of Hollywood's biggest and most popular entertainments. Stellar cast includes Steve McQueen (Bullitt, The Getaway), Robert Vaughn (Superman III), and O.J. Simpson (The Naked Gun 2 & 1/2 - The Smell of Fear).
B00003CXXP|4.0|Hayley Joel Osment plays David, a robot child, the first designed to have emotions, taken in by a couple who's own son is in a coma and may never awaken. But when that child surprisingly revives, David is no longer wanted! David, and his only companion, an adorable robot Teddy Bear who is basically the Jiminy Cricket character of the picture, are abandoned by the \\"mother\\" they had come to love. David becomes obsessed with the story of Pinocchio, and the idea that if he finds the Blue Fairy of the story, she can make him into a real boy. He then embarks on a quest to do just that, with no discerning between fairytale and reality. In his search he experiences  things quite similar to those Pinocchio experienced in his adventures, only in A.I. they are giving a much darker, downright sadder interpretation. <BR>          The film moves rather slowly, and it is pretty darn depressing most of the time, but it is nonetheless fascinating to behold! The ending is possibly supposed to be happy, bittersweet more likely, but overall one might find it rather disturbing. I would not call this a film for kids, but definitely everyone who is old enough to handle the dark concepts should experience it. That's exactly what it is, an experience. This is NOT Disney's Pinocchio folks!
6305508550|4.0|Mike Judge, the man behind the notorious duo of chuckling, burrito eating idiots Beavis and Butthead, manages to capture the frustration of cubicle drones everywhere in this nifty little comedy. The cast was well chosen and it's an overall entertaining movie. However, there were a few \\"adult\\" scenes that only damage the charming effect that the plot has on its audience. All in all, it's definitely worth owning. A must have for anyone anywhere who hates their job.
B00005Y228|5.0|I luv her CD... All da songs have a beat and thats da best thing about her. Every song (including slow songs) have a beat. Also does anyone no what CD I have. It includes the normal songs but also has Boy and Butterfly. All I can say is, after hearing TWO singles, you'll get Kylie Fever for sure!
B00005RFAI|5.0|If u like the Pink from &quot;Cant take Me home&quot;, youll get a little shocked when heard this. This CD represent another whole level in the music of Pink, cause now she sings with honesty, honesty that bleeds on this disc. The songs are very personal and mean something... &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;, my favorite song on the album, her voice sounds strong and sad at the same time, just like in &quot;Family Portrait&quot; u can feel the pain on her voice... the first single &quot;GTPS&quot; dont represent the feeling of the whole CD, but dont think that the music on this disc it's depressing... songs like &quot;Respect&quot;, &quot;18 Wheeler&quot;, &quot;Missundaztood&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; are really great with a lot of heavy bits and awesome guitars... the CD it's worth the money, honestly, buy it and feel the new side of P!nk and her music... u'll see her in a different way... after listening this CD.
B000002TPS|5.0|Megadeth may have shyed away from sheer metal  after \\"Rust\\", but they by no means lost their edge. \\"Youth\\" sports gigantic, killer riffs with the best being on \\"Reckoning Day\\", \\"Victory\\", well, mostly all of them get in your head one way or another.  Also, the lyrics on this album are more focused on one issue rather than sarcastic jokes (you know what I mean). For example, the \\"Killing Road\\" talks about the life of a touring band, \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" speaks about suicide, and the title track contemplates government corruption.  On this album, compared to other Megadeth releases, they are more focused and mature without losing any of their edge.
B00005R2M3|5.0|When i bought this CD i wasnt very sure... but when i put it on my CD player, Bang!, the music begin and i was very impress. Shakira shows that is an artist first of all; the talent it's the important part on this CD, cause her music, her voice and her lyrics are amazing... songs like &quot;Objection&quot;, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, &quot;Rules&quot;, &quot;The One&quot;, etc... are the prove that Shakira is here to stay for a long time. Obviously recommended, good rock music for rock, pop and music lovers in general.
B000002TPS|5.0|This album is one of Megadeth's best, in terms of song quality, how it flows and the balance of songwriting.  Megadeth has rarely been as heavy an \\"Youthanasia\\" and almost anyone can tell that.  Megadeth shows their jazz-like chops in a sound as heavy as it is musical.  But the album is made all the more dealier by adding in killer hooks, masterful arrangements and guitar playing so damn good, you'll wonder if Mustaine and Freidman just have their guitars as extra limbs.  By listening over and over, you hear something new each time either more clearer or something you missed all together.<br />Song for song, this album packs a mature punch seldom heard from anywhere.  It all kicks off with the stone solid set that shows varying tempos and intensity, \\"Reckoning Day,\\" \\"Train of Consequences,\\" \\"Addicted to Choas,\\" and the ballad ''A Tout Le Monde.\\"  Then goes into a set that relies more on a central riff than the arrangements seen in the first four, but they are nonetheless crunching.  \\"Elysian Fields\\" is a chunky rocker but with a Maiden like feel that keep you bouncing and it has a harmonica bridge with guitars in the background that will leave wanting to hear it over and over again.  \\"The Killing Road\\" is more kinetic, sinewy kind of rocker, with an extended riff and a killer solo section.  Next, is the slower, more dilberate \\"Blood of Heroes.'' Once again Megadeth comes forth with a set of riffs to blow you away but combine it with a sombre, classical begining but quickly builds to a chunky riff and eventually another great solo section.  <br />The rest of the album is consistent with the formula set by the first two-thirds but hold their own.  \\"Family Tree\\"is a semi-ballad of sorts that talks about the taboo issue if incest with great music that accentuates the songs mellow tone and melancoly delivery.  The title track starts from a slow start to a rip-roaring bridge and seathing solos.  \\"I Thought I Knew It All'' is another meloncaly song with more great riffs.\\"Black Curtains\\" is crushing, and \\"Victory\\" is just plain cool.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone who likes rock, metal and perhaps jazz because this album seemlessly combines all three of those.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie and her music, what can i say?... if u wanna heard some ballads and realx in your tab... don´t buy this CD... but if u wanna dance and have a great time: Buy it!!!. <BR>The dance tracks on this disc are just the best, songs like \\"Love At Fist Sight\\", \\"CGUOOMH\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Fever\\", etc, were made to dance with all your muscles. The disc it's a box of singles and hits, and meens the return of Kylie to american ears... 100% good dance and pop music, highly recommended!
B00005JKJA|3.0|Director Lynch is very good at making his audience think about the storyline and his characters.  During my earlier young adult years I was completely enthralled by his work especially the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.  Well, for this movie that was originally intended for television, we have a movie that definitely makes you think.<br />Salon.com has disected this movie to help people understand this film.  Other Websites especially college professors have done the same.  In other words, if you are buying this DVD to think that you are going to watch the &quot;usual&quot; type of movie and understand the storyline, well...&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is not that kind of movie.<br />As a matter of fact, I have watched it three times, read the websites and now I have a much better appreciation for this film.  You CAN NOT watch this film and think of it as a usual film and that everything is comprehendible.<br />This movie is about dream and reality and it is up to you to piece together what is dream and what is reality and in the end find out what led to the final scene.  Of course, to help confuse you is the typical Lynch style of things that is tiny old people, a sort of &quot;pandora's box&quot;, a blue key and a cowboy that makes you want to say...&quot;eh?&quot;<br />That said, some will enjoy it, some won't.  I on the otherhand think I do...and at the same time I think I don't.  That's the effect this movie has on you....it will stick in your head.  Silencio.<br />Now for the DVD, this is where I score things down.  Lack of special features on a DVD is bad but when there are no chapter tracks on the DVD, that makes it worse.  You literally have to use your goto button and type in the time to get to a certain scene or be patient and use fast forward or fast rewind.  These two (which I call &quot;flaws&quot;) of the DVD is unacceptable.  This movie deserves much more...and I'm hoping that perhaps a special edition will come out because there are some interesting interviews that Lynch has done for this movie.<br />Last, there are two different covers for the DVD.  To my knowledge, there is no difference...just the covers.<br />That being said, I enjoyed the movie but the DVD deserved better.sting interviews that Lynch has done for this movie.<br />Last, there are two different covers for the DVD.

B0000AUHOH|4.0|I want costumers to stop saying that Star Trek V: the Final Frontier is a bad movie!  Sure, Star Trek V is not the best film in the Star Trek movie series but It's not the worst. The worst movie by far is Star Trek: Nemesis! This movie directed by William Shatner, was a critical box office failure only because Paramount Pictures did not believe in William Shatner's vision to find God! The Enterprise crew is hijacked by a Vulcan renegade who happens to be Spock's half brother, Sybok. I wish people understood this film better because Star Trek V has the fun and spirit of the original 1960s Star Trek series.  If you think about It? Which of the other films had more character development with the original cast then this one? Many of the characters interactions like Kirk, Spock, and McCoy at the campfire scene in Mount Yosemite and Scotty and Uhura's love triangle , Sybock's laughing in the sunlight added to this films pleasant humor. This is not the worst Star Trek movie ever made. A-
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is the one we have all waited for.  Do not even think twice about it.  Buy it NOW!  It's so much better than the glut of othere DVD's that we have all purchased like good little consumers.  I had not seen the orchestral tour and was approaching this DVD with trepidation.  Surely we all remember the dreadful &quot;Symphonic Tributes&quot; to Yes, Genesis, Tull etc... not so this time.  The orchestral arrangements are MASTERFUL and the orchestra was tight as can be.  I was stunned.  If you don't have a lump in your throat during &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; then you must be dead. :-)<BR>The band was first rate.  Everyone sounds better than they have in years.  Truly.  And THANK GOD Wakeman is gone.  New Keys man Tom Brislin is the best part of this whole show.  What a glorious thing to hear all the original parts actually played properly and not the arpeggiated masturbatory approximation we have suffered with for the past 20 years.  Just buy the blessed thing.

B000002UTY|3.0|Quicksilver doesn't have the lasting name recognition of peers like the Dead and the Airplane, and there's a reason: Their albums weren't as good.<BR>&quot;Happy Trails,&quot; their best-known LP and an improvisatory showcase for the band, is a case in point. <BR>Some of the jams are inspired, especially parts of the famous &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; epic. (Bassist David Freiberg doesn't get the props he deserves for a cool solo.)<BR>But the whole thing, to me anyway, never crosses that line between competent and truly magical. <BR>Greg Elmore may be the root of the problem, as he lacks, IMHO, the inventiveness and propulsiveness of the best jam-band drummers. <br />The album also suffers from today's continuous CD sequencing. <BR>On LP, you could take a break between sides 1 and 2. But now, you go from 25 minutes of Diddley-beat jamming on &quot;Who Do You Love,&quot; straight into another nine minutes of Diddley on &quot;Mona,&quot; which gets tiresome.<br />The rest of the record is a mishmash of, again, occasionally inspired jams. &quot;Calvary,&quot; despite some cliched Middle-Eastern riffing, is probably the hottest.<BR>And the poorly sung version of &quot;Happy Trails&quot; that closes the album ... well, it pains me to say that I prefer it the way Van Halen does it.<br />For all my carping, this isn't a *bad* record. Jam-band fans will love it, and it's probably a good representation of a typical Saturday night at the old Fillmore.<BR>But those looking for truly top-quality S.F. psychedelia ought to look into albums by the Dead and Airplane -- not to mention the Steve Miller Band's excellent debut -- before getting acquainted with this one.
B000005ALN|5.0|I don't know why I have waited so long to rate this cd. However on my billionth listen I can't help it. George this is true genius...Your tribute to Jobim is immaculate. Most won't know that...cuz Jobim is so darn subtle...but you got it..wow. I only wish I was born in the late nineteen thirties and listening to this in spain sipping on Spanish beer wooing someone special...enough said...five out of five!
B00003CX5P|4.0|The movie I'd already owned, in VHS format. I liked the movie. I think this trilogy is less about the characters and more about the world that they live in, and thus the movies focus on that. Also, it's about an 8 year old boy - so it's written that way. It's not nessisarily an adult movie. And when I look at these facts, it becomes a better one for me. I was vaguely dissapointed that there wern't more cool features that came with the DVD, but just getting it was enough for me. I figure when he releases all 6 in 2015 (my safe estimate!) it will be a vast improvement.
1577311523|5.0|A clear, objective and a brilhant exposition. It goes straight to the core of the spiritual search, which is, basicaly, regain the consciousness of the inner Self - our true identity and reality. The author speaks of his own experience, and shows how is possible for anyone who realy want to reach that state of absolute peace and joy inside us. There is someting realy new in this book.
B00004RITP|5.0|Sir Simon is one of the best Mahler's interpretors (if not the best) of today. He has given some memorable accounts of the symphonies, the Ressuraction being the ultimate paradigm of his feeling for Mahler. <BR>The structure of the unfinished Tenth is as loose as that of the Seventh. In all movements but the Adagio you feel this is not a finished work though Cooke has worked miracles giving us another Mahlerian masterpiece. But still something is missing...<BR>Unlike the recording of the &quot;Song of the Night&quot; recorded with the CBSO for EMI, Rattle holds the music together like a Karajan or a Reiner but he also adds the freshness of a Bernstein. In the Adagio (the movement Mahler had finished) Rattle reminds me the Karajan of the 60s - well-paced with great feeling for the music. After that initial step he is transformed to a Bernstein leaving the BPO loose. The music making is definitely fresh and the sounds produced are marvellous. <BR>An excellent account that I would put up there with that of Ormandy and Levine (RCA OOP).
B000023X9W|5.0|One always has to listen to one of Neil Youngs new releases a few times before passing judgement on them. He has the unique ability to switch directions in his music and this may catch the casual listener off guard. Silver and Gold, as it turns out, is in my opinion, the best acoustic work NY has done to date. I don't know if it's because he writes and sings with more life under his belt, or if he's personally in a better place now. This CD is reflective, insightful and full of good feelings. But how many artist recording today can put you in the mood to welcome the change of a season, take in a big gulp of fresh air and notice the subtle difference of a September Sun and make you feel glad to be alive?. Neil Youngs acoustic music is transcendental that way. It is for me and I hope it is for you too!
6305537321|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I fell in love with it.  It can make me cry no matter when I watch it.  The simple theme of love, and how it jumps upon a person without any warning.  It is classic, yet its themes are just as meaningfull now as in 1961.  It is also packed with humor: the no name cat, holly's wild party of drunks, the five and dime masks . . . This is a classic that should showcase every movie collection.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I'm not a huge Sci-Fi fan, but this movie blew me away! It has every trick in the book to keep you on the edge of your seat and scare you silly. Great visuals, sound and story make this movie one of my favorites of all times. The Dvd version has a making of featurette and 2 different commentaries. Very interesting.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Harry Potter was one of the big event movies of 2001, and its massive box office and popularity showed the world that kids do still read books \\"on occasion\\". For the uninitiated, Harry Potter is the story of a boy who discovers he is the heir to a proud tradition of magic, and travels to Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry. The movie is a very faithful adaptation of the novel, and also showed the world that directors can successfully adapt novels and remain faithful to the source.<br />Perhaps though, Harry Potter is a little too faithful. The movie tells the story competently, but does not add anything new or insightful. Basically, what you see is what you get, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Either way, however, I feel the movie did not justify it's long running time. While I'll admit I can't offer any suggestions offhand of where the movie might be trimmed, I do believe that a slimmer, more compact screenplay could've been written. Perhaps if the film had an exciting climax I might have forgiven this, but it doesn't. I can only imagine how annoyed those who didn't read the novels felt after two and a half hours when the movie ended rather anti-climatically. All in all, Harry Potter is still a very good movie. I wouldn't call it the next \\"Wizard of Oz\\" (like the DVD's packaging does), but it definitely has potential to make a very good franchise.<br />Speaking of the packaging, this is where Warner Bros. really dropped the snitch. For those not in the know, Warner Bros. is one of the most reviled DVD producers of the major film companies. For awhile, many feared that Warner Bros. would package Harry Potter in one of its cheap, cardboard snapper cases, using a double-sided disc. While this was thankfully not the case, the results are definitely a disappointment. The packaging is still made of cardboard, with the discs being held in those awkward plastic boards ala Simpsons or Moulin Rouge. Considering that the movie is aimed at children, WB could've made sure the package was a little more child-friendly.<br />But more importantly, especially for a two-disc set, the extras are sorely lacking. The majority of disc two is taken up by point and click \\"interactive\\" games that unlock the deleted scenes. I don't know who at Warner Bros thought the \\"target audience\\" would appreciate this, but my brother and sister are part of that audience, and they were left severly frustrated trying to access the deleted scenes. Besides those scenes, there is a mini featurette and a trailer or two, but almost nothing else. No commentaries, no special effects documentaries, interviews with J.K. Rowling, NOTHING. Harry Potter may use two discs, but only one was really needed. Warner needs to learn how to produce a proper two-disc special edition.<br />As a movie, Harry Potter is worth the purchase. It's overly long, but still enjoyable. Just understand that you're basically paying for the movie, and very little else.uld've made sure the package was a little more child-friendly.<br />But more importantly, especially for a two-disc set, the extras are sorely lacking.

6304806434|5.0|This movie is high pithced and fast. Yes the plot is absurd and the movies plot is an excuse for outstanding stunts but so what. The action is rhythmic and the cast is great. Malkovich has great fun as Cyrus the Virus. He chews the scenery as a genius who is literally insane. Cage is great at playing the good boy who is willing to take action against Cyrus. And Cusack has great persuasion in screaming into phones which he does a lot. But no matter the action is terrific with pumped up soundtrack to help it stay together. The best action scene is where a rope at the back end of the plane gets caught on a mid-sixties corvette and it gets dragged along in the air until it crashes into the tower and falls destroying itself on impact with the ground.
B00005JL3A|4.0|...  There are some really cool action sequences involving both gun and fist fights.  There are also some really cool special effects, the laser room comes to mind.  Much of it is not feasible, but hey, it's a Sci-Fi movie.  If you want realism, buy Saving Private Ryan.  The gore in this movie isn't too terrible, there are a few bloody parts, but the whole movie isn't straight shooting guys heads off as the editoral review would lead you to believe.  There are some parts where the movies drags a bit, but overall it is entertaing throughout.  So if you want a fun, suspensful movie then check out Resident Evil, but if you have absoutly no imagination, then you may want to skip this one.  Plus, Milla Jovovich runs around in a short skirt, always a bonus! ...
B000002LQD|4.0|In both his Velvet Underground and solo days, Lou Reed has explored dark themes: sex, S&M, drugs, mind trips, and the rough street life.  His art has been about experiencing these things, not so much social commentary.  One dark theme has not been that much of a preoccupation.  In Magic and Loss, Lou switches gears and looks at life's experiences contemplatively, but focuses heavily on its end--death.  This was inspired by the recent deaths by cancer of two friends and apparently also the AIDS epidemic.<br />The majority of songs are mellow, with soft, sweet guitar riffs, allowing us to focus on Lou's very strong lyrics.  There are also five strong rockers:  the opener (effectively), \\"What's Good\\"; the acoustic \\"Sword of Damocles\\"; \\"Warrior King\\"; \\"Gassed and Stoked\\"; and \\"Power and Glory Part II.\\"  The first two are marked by crisp, pretty definition in the rhythm guitars, smooth strokes, in contrast to the guitars in the others, which have the edge, and a bit of the fuzziness and distortion, often seen in Lou's work.  \\"What's Good\\" and \\"Warrior King,\\" the CD's most potent tune, are the two best songs.  The softer, mostly slower songs are good too.  My only problem is that there are too many of them:  six of seven between the opener and \\"Warrior King.\\"<br />There is a positive spin to Magic and Loss, witness the album title and the concluding title cut:  \\"There's a bit of magic in everything and then some loss to even things out.\\"  Lou sees things both ways, focusing heavily on hardship and death, but also dignity.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Well, I bought the \\"Moulin Rouge\\" soundtrack before even seeing the movie, and I knew almost immediately that I would love the movie. It was so much fun to be able to sing along to the songs in the movie when I finally saw it! This soundtrack is just wonderful. I've had it for a few months now, and I haven't tired of it yet! My personal favorite song is \\"El Tango de Roxanne\\". I always liked that song, and when I realized it was on the CD, I was just like \\"awesome!\\". So yeah, I definitely reccommend this CD, and the movie! You won't be disappointed (unless you are one of those conventional people who don't believe in pop-like, sexy musicals)!
B00005JKBC|4.0|*SPOILERS*<BR>I withhold a fifth star of an otherwise excellent film because of what appears to be a glaring error in the unfolding sequence that leads to the ultimate rescue of Bishop (Pitt). The apparent gaff is this: Muir (Redford) cleverly forges a document claiming to come from the Director of Central Intelligence to a commander on a U.S. Navy warship near China. The forged document orders the U.S. Commander to organize and execute a clandestine mission in China to free Bishop (Pitt) from prison. The Navy commander phones Muir (Redford) for confirmation of the mission, receives it, and executes the mission successfully. <BR>To my knowledge, there is no way that a U.S. Navy commander would follow the order of the Director of the CIA without going through either the Commander in Chief (President) or from the normal U.S. Navy chain of command.  The Director of CIA is not authorized, unless directly empowered by the President, to order U.S. military actions against a foreign country.  No U.S. Navy commander would follow such an order. He would check it out with his superiors. <BR>This gap makes the entire movie fall flat because the ultimate outcome, the rescue, could never have occurred on the orders, forged or not, from the Director of CIA.
B000066NW0|5.0|A great album from a yound talented girl from Canada. Starts slowly from &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, and gets into it at the second song &quot;Complicated, which is now very well known. &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; keeps the beat going, nice song about love between a skater and a ballet girl. &quot;I'm With You&quot; slows it down a bit, to catch your breath back. &quot;Mobile&quot; gets it going again, and is a perfect song for a next single. I definelty see it on radio stations. &quot;Unwanted&quot; is Avril's rock song, in my opinion. Would be great on a live performance. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is very good an has am unique sound but it seems like a Jessica Andrews ballad. &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; is a catchy song, which might remind you of a Ralph Lauren tv commercial. A great song, and Avril knows how to make you want to hear it again ! &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; is my fave out of the whole album. Describes about a girl who's to shy to tell a guy she likes him. I specially like the lyrics like &quot;Marry Me Today&quot;, which I guess says it all. &quot;My World&quot; is just fabulous. Finally I listen an artist sing about their hometown with so much energy. Napanee seems quite important to her, which I appreciate. &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, I consider it to be a rather ordinary song with a little something extra, what I like to call Avril's touch. It's either you like or you don't. The two last songs are quite slow compared to the rest. It's not bad, and it's a great closure, that's if you don't count the Complicated Mix. Overall great by a new artist. She has a long career if she follows the path she's in now.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Does anyone else in here think that this album is somewhat reminiscent of Pavement?  A helpful/not helpful will suffice as an answer (please don't bother if you aren't familiar with Pavement.)

0609610570|5.0|The book was an excellent presentation of the most critical discipline required for an organization to succeed.  We have observed the flawed business fundamentals of the dot coms, World Com's, Enron's, etc.  Strategy is just strategy.  Tactical is just tactical.  And while both are important, execution is the most critical component.<br />My only criticism of the book is that it did not go deep enough.  The authors are respected business leaders, and I would have appreciated more detailed insight.  They should consider Part II.
B000002AS3|5.0|yeah they are a great rock and roll band and yes they are from england but that doesn't mean they are copying the beatles, surely we brits are allowed more than one band! <BR>I LOVE this album and it hurts me when people put it down! Surely songs such as slide away and live forever alone are good enough to justify the buying of this album. I ask for you all to think independantly and give oasis a try all of their albums are great and I am getting their new one tommorow, all the songs are class and individual (Im not sure if you will agree with that one but this is my opinion).<BR>I admit that oasis may seem cocky also but their main man (noel) admits that they are not as good as and never will be as good as the beatles along with other bands and it is just the press who compare them. give it a try!!! england will still be buying this album in 30 or 40 years!
6303109950|1.0|How can anyone watch this garbage?  I got through over half the film but not without fast forwarding more than a few scenes.  Finally I couldn't waste my time any longer.  I found the acting to be hammy when I could find it believable at all.  Wasn't that the dimwit from \\"Wings\\" playing a rugged cowboy?  Yeah, that's believable...  These characters don't even look like they belong in this era.  I think the mustaches were added to make the actors look older.  They travel over great distances and then come on camera with every hair in place and not a spot of dust to be found on their clothing.  Give me a break.  Rent \\"My Darling Clementine\\" instead.  It has real actors: Henry Fonda, Victor Mature, Ward Bond, Walter Brennan and is truly a great western.  Tombstone is garbage.
0312265859|3.0|As much as I looked forward to this most recent Stephanie Plum book, I found myself being disappointed as I read it.  With the preceeding seven books, I had a hard time putting each one down to catch a few winks of sleep before the sun came in the windows.  With Hard Eight, I didn't have that problem.  I kept reading, thinking that something different was going to happen, but, with one exception, nothing did.  It was the same old story with the troublesome bond-skipper and the exploding cars. Fortunately, the humor and relationship tensions were still there, but trying to recreate Benito Ramirez in the person on Eddie Abruzzi didn't quite make the grade. The ending was rather disjointed, as if Ms. Evanovich didn't quite know how to end this story to continue on to the next one.<BR>While I didn't dislike this book, I didn't think it was up to the standard of the previous seven.  Here's hoping the next one will capture that elusive quality again.
B000021Y74|4.0|I recently saw Frank Potente in \\"The Bourne Identity\\" and I just had to learn more about her.  Franka is amazing.  I looked through the Internet to find out more about her and I came across \\"Run Lola Run.\\"  Franka is amazing.  In \\"Run Lola Run\\" she gives a great performance as a sexy young woman trying to save her boyfriend's life by searching for 100,000 Marks in a twenty minute span.  Franka is amazing.  In an ever-so European manner, the film is a combination of techno and artistic brilliance, leaving the viewer entranced.  Franka is amazing.  The film is also a love story similar to \\"Bonnie & Clyde.\\"  Franka is amazing.  Though the animation part still leaves me puzzled, I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in European/techno films and/or anyone fascinated by Franka Potente.  Franka is amazing.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A by Radiohead is easily their best album. Even though many have not liked it as much as The Bends and Ok Computer I disagree with that. On Kid A there are less parts but instead each note or sound has a meaning, an example of this is on The National Anthem there are lots of sounds in the background and they just add to the whole alien abduction that the song is about (what I think). More layer don't always make a better whole. This CD has also gotten worse ratings because it completely abandoned their rock base and went to this relatively unexplored territory of I don't know what. The lyrics written so they can be interpreted and the same for the music it is an extremely psychological CD and will create a amazing and different experience for each listener. But for almost everyone it is the most disturbing CD they have heard.<BR>THE SONGS:<BR>Everything in it's right place- A perfect start to easily one of the best CDs ever. The music gives the feel of a forming of a human embryo and the lyrics support that slightly. It has a strong alien sound.<BR>Kid A- Gets in to the mind of a kid and the music gives such strong pictures that can be of whatever you sense from the music.<BR>The National Anthem- It has strong jazz influences and can be interpreted in so many ways, but it is always extremely violent it is the most painful song I've ever heard.<BR>How to disappear completely- It is so perfect the whole mood is captured perfectly and I think that everyone can relate to this song. It is amazing how such childish words as \\"I'm not here/ This isn't happening\\" can be so powerful. The vocals are amazing. At the end of the song they have the crying sounds then the happy end like there is a solution and then the singing stops. Those made me think that there was a suicide attempt and then the person fell into the river and was given another chance at living in Treefingers.<BR>Treefingers- How can he play that on the guitar? This easily tops Labradford by having no melody,unbeatable flow, and no repeating.<BR>Optimistic- The lyrics are so great because create powerful and disturbing images and mental states. The guitar perfectly gets the feel of a place where a battle just took place.<BR>In Limbo- This song has a feeling of drugs and makes it seem that the character went to drugs because they were depressed.<BR>Idioteque- The lyrics seem at first to make less sense than Paranoid Android and they are even more amazing the lyrics are about a war that is in the city where the character lives. The beats work amazingly well as the gunshots and the occasional machine gun sound where you can here things falling to the ground is amazing.<BR>Morning Bell- The messy divorce song is so powerful and the instruments give what is going on in the husband's head perfectly. At the end there is the moaning sound and it just give the drunk and cannot take anymore and completely out of it feeling so perfectly.<BR>Motion Picture Soundtrack- This can prove to so many that Radiohead is the best band in the world. The organ, singing, harp, and the creaking benches are perfect they create the more real than life pictures. The lyrics seem to be about the suicide of the character's wife that he was splitting with in Morning Bell. The best line of this song is \\"I think you're crazy, maybe\\".<BR>This CD is their best and proves them to be the best band in the world. It creates amazing emotions and images. It tells the life of someone from pre-birth to their wife's suicide. In 30 years this will be regarded so much better than it is now. This will be a strong inspiration for music and un-like almost all music every note, sound and work has meaning and bring sound to visuals. Radiohead has to continue with this direction and permanently abandon their rock start they have proved that they can achieve so much anywhere they want so why wouldn't they want to be the future of music. If they continue this they WILL be the most influential and innovative band of this decade and possible this century. How can you not say this is the best band in the world?
B00005JKNF|5.0|Robert Altman began his career over fifty years ago in television, directing episodes of early popular shows like \\"Route 66\\" and Maverick\\". Who'd have thought he would go on to direct some of the most interesting movies ever made, or that at the beginning of the 21st Century, he'd still be going strong? Like anyone whose career has spanned more than half a century, he has had his peaks and valleys. Movies like \\"M.A.S.H.\\" and \\"Nashville\\" made him famous in the early 1970s. For the next two decades his work was so hit and miss that some thought he'd lost his touch, but he came roaring back in the 1990s with pictures like \\"The Player\\" and Short Cuts\\". Now comes \\"Gosford Park\\", one of his best works ever. <br />The English countryside, 1932. Sir William McCordle [Michael Gambon] and his wife, Lady Sylvia [Kristin Scott Thomas] have invited a dozen guests for the weekend. They arrive with their servants, who disappear downstairs while their employers go up to the lavish suites and drawing rooms of Gosford Park House. While the grand ladies and gentlemen are doing their best to impress and entertain each other, the servants are busy seeing to it that everything runs smoothly. The intrigue and gossip downstairs is at least as complex and interesting as it is upstairs. Class and tradition may separate the two groups, but, as the story moves along, we see that they are actually connected in all sorts of ways. Everything runs smoothly until someone [or perhaps more than one] rudely kills the host.... Twice!<br />After the murder, the plot gets a little murky, but most viewers will be having too much fun to care. Altman movies are rarely about story. They are about the characters. His genius lies in his ability to take a script with many speaking parts and make all of the characters distinct and memorable. Most directors can't handle more than six or seven  characters. \\"Gosford Park\\" has over thirty. <br />The legendary Maggie Smith is a real scene-stealer as the shrewd, wittyand acerbic Constance, Sir William's not-so-devoted sister. Ms. Smith can make you laugh just by twitching her lip or raising an eyebrow. Helen Mirren plays Mrs. Wilson, head housekeeper of Gosford Park. She knows everyone's secrets. Stephen Fry is Inspector Thompson, who is more interested in the trappings of his job than he is in actually finding out who killed Sir William, while Alan Bates is Jennings, the head butler who knows he's at the top of his profession. The list of players goes on and on. Some roles are larger than others are, but none of the actors seems to mind. They say that working with Altman is a joy. <br />\\"Gosford Park\\", by the way, is a comedy. It has a lot to say about class structure and the way people interact with one another. It shows how people often say one thing and mean another or use words as verbal swords. But Altman never preaches. He's one of life's keenest observers. It's a joy to share his observations.
B000001E8S|5.0|This is the most unique music U2 has done.  If you want to be shocked by the diversity this band has displayed over their career, play \\"Out of Control\\" off of Boy and then crank up \\"Your Blue Room\\" off this album.<br />Passengers makes for great listening, especially when you're feeling a little moody.  It's a great disc and a must for any real U2 fan.
B00005JKNC|2.0|When I was as a kid, one of my favorite movies was an epic Western called \\"Little Big Man\\". In one scene, an old Indian chief tells Dustin Hoffman's character that it's a good day to die. They go up to the sacred mountain, and the chief lays down to die. After a few hours, it's obvious that he isn't going to pass on, so he gets up. Dustin asks him why he didn't die, and the chief shrugs his shoulders and replies, \\"Sometimes the magic works, and sometimes it doesn't.\\" I have always remembered that line and applied it to many situations in life. <br />Movie magic doesn't work in \\"The Majestic\\". Though it's well intentioned and aims to be uplifting, I found it laborious to sit through it. It isn't just that it's long, although some judicious editing might have helped. It's that the story, the style and the feel are totally bogus. It looks back longingly at an America that never existed. The movie recalls the 1940s Hollywood version of the small town life, not the real thing. The result is an oddity, sort of a fiction based on a fiction. <br />Peter Appleton [Jim Carrey] is an up and coming screenwriter in post-W.W.II Hollywood. Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous House Committee on Un-American Activities is in the midst of a witch hunt in Hollywood, looking for Communist conspirators. [This much of the movie is true.] Peter, who attended a few Communist party meeting in college because he was chasing some girl, is caught up in all this. Thinking his career is now ruined, he gets very drunk one night. He decides to go for a drive and winds up crashing his car into a river near a small California town. He is saved but has amnesia. The town lost a large number of sons to the war, and Peter looks so much like one of them that even the missing man's father thinks he is his son miraculously returned. Peter suspects he isn't the guy, but, since he has no memory, plays along. He helps the man reopen his old movie theater and generally helps the town's citizens rediscovery joy andhope. Meanwhile, the Feds are looking for Peter to make him testify before the Committee. <br />I do like Jim Carrey, whose performance is excellent. If his fans can not accept him in a serious role, that does nothing to lessen the fact that he is a fine dramatic actor as well as a great comedian. His turn in \\"The Truman Show\\" was one of the acting highlights of 1999. <br />The movie has been compared to the works of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges, two great directors from the 1930s and 1940s. I suggest that those making the comparisons go back and watch some of these old movies again. Capra often used a sentimental approach, but this was back in the days when addressing social injustices was a trickier matter than it is today. His movies were born of a sweet naivete. \\"The Majestic\\" seems simply manipulative. Sturges had an acerbic wit. His characters were smart and quick-witted. He made his best social commentaries through laughter. \\"The Majestic\\" is none of these things. <br />Ironically, the movies that post-WWII Hollywood is most famous for are not the happy, warm ones, but the ones that were gritty, realistic and/or full of dark overtones. Post 9/11, it's proving to be much the same.  \\"The Majestic\\" was a major boxoffice flop.
0790729652|3.0|Tim Burton does a fantastic job of transposing his dark, nightmarish vision of Gotham City onto the widescreen in this Superhero effort. The cast includes the top-notch acting talents of Micheal Keaton, Jack Palance and Jack Nicholson. The special effects are well done, the sound of the Batmobile is terrific & the Bat cave looks like something out of Dante's INFERNO.<br />So what is the problem, you ask? Why the mediocre rating? The answer is: Michael Keaton. That Keaton is a terrific actor is not in dispute. In fact, he is one of my favorite current actors. The problem lies not in his acting ability, but in his physique.<br />See, Keaton is even smaller than I am, and I am certainly nobody's 1st choice to play Bruce Wayne. In the comic book lore, Bruce Wayne is always depicted as this hulking figure whom you just don't want to mess with. Keaton doesn't fit that criteria (and neither do I!).<br />Tobey Maguire is a small fellow, but he made a terrific SPIDERMAN. That's because SPIDERMAN has genuine Super-powers; it does not matter if he's on the puny side. Batman does not have Super-powers. His crime fighting ability rests upon his working out in the gym (probably 3-4 hours a day), his cunning and his gadgets / inventions. This film focuses mostly on the gadgets, mostly due to the fact that Keaton is not believable as a guy who can throw people around.<br />Truth be told, Val Kilmer and George Clooney did not match my vision of Bruce Wayne, either. Both were more believable than Keaton, but when I think of Bruce Wayne I traditionally think of a Dolph Lundgren type physique. Of course, Clooney also had the misfortune of being in by far the worst of the BATMAN movies.<br />On the upside, Keaton's acting ability does account for some measure of why this movie is worth seeing. He does a splendid job of portraying an emotionally tormented man who leads the double life of ordinary person & Superhero. Furthermore, Nicholson is outstanding as Batman's arch-enemy, the Joker.<br />So, all-in-all, I rate this film a 3 star effort. Certainly worth seeing, but with serious shortcomings in the casting department.r.<br />So, all-in-all, I rate this film a 3 star effort.

B00005JKQZ|4.0|I have somewhat mixed emotions about \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". It certainly succeeds as entertainment. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give two of the best performances of 2001. Ron Howard proves himself more than merely a dependable, workmanlike director. This story of real life mathematician John Nash's long battle with paranoid schizophrenia became an improbable boxoffice hit as well a multi-Oscar winner. Still, I think all of its flashiness and moments of brilliance say much more about the magic of movies than they do about mental illness. Madness was never this romantic for John Nash and his wife, Alicia. I think that in changing so many elements of the real story, the movie weighs in a little more on the side of commercialism than on art. To me, this prevents it from being a classic. I'd call it a very good movie. <br />Crowe and Connelly, about whom I can't say enough, make the problems I had with the movie's script nearly irrelevant.  Connelly has been around for a number of years, making mostly independent films. With her remarkable talent, the transition to the big time was almost inevitable. Her Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress was much deserved, as was Crowe's nomination for Best Actor. He won the award last year for \\"Gladiator\\" and was nominated the year before for \\"The Insider\\". The way he transforms himself for each role is amazing.<br /> \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" brought Ron Howard his first nomination ever for Best Director. He won. He's what I would call a populist director, one who makes good movies for a wide audience. He reminds me somewhat of Preston Sturges (1898-1959), who also made movies for the masses. Five or six of them are now regarded as among the most entertaining classics ever made. He was never nominated for Best Director. Who really believes the Oscars are about art, anyway?
B00005JKCF|5.0|Finally, \\"Spider-Man\\" is here! Personally, I thought it was great that they decided to do a live-action version of this classic comic book character rather than a dumb animated one, like the TV show. To me, live-action is always better, mainly though because the films looks more real. I just saw \\"Spider-Man\\" and have to say that it was fantastic! I already cannot wait for it's sequel, which will hopefully be released next year in 2003. <br />If you've ever read the comic books and saw the show, then you've probably got a good idea on what this movie was all about. Spider-Man vs. the evil Green Goblin (played by William Dafeo). It's also about how Peter Parker (played perfectly by Tobey Maguire) came to be Spider-Man, and trying to win over the affection of the beautiful Mary-Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst). There's a lot of action and spin-tingly moments. Although I still thought \\"Star Wars--Episode II, Attack of the Clones\\" was a better film, \\"Spider-Man\\" was still awesome and worth seeing, but basically because I am a bigger \\"Star Wars\\" fan than \\"Spider-Man\\" fan...I really only went to see \\"Spider-Man\\" because I heard it was a good movie and I'm really into sci-fic/fantasy/action movies. Plus, I also think Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor (but Hayden Christensen in \\"Star Wars\\" is hotter, and I believe, more talented!). <br />Anyway, getting back to \\"Spider-Man\\", the special effects were amazing and a great touch to the film. The storyline and dialouge were strong, but dialouge seems to never be a very important element in fantasy and action films, in reality. The acting was superb, including the performances by the supporting roles. I can't wait for the \\"Spider-Man\\" DVD to be released and I'm glad I got the chance to see it on the big screen. I believe \\"Spider-Man\\" will be nominated for a few Oscars next year...I think though mostly for technical nods, if any. Probably not any acting nods, and most definitely not a best picture nod because fantasy films just don't get nominated for best picture, which is wrong, I know...because there are a lot of excellent fantasy films out there that the Oscar judges overlook, come Oscar time! Sam Raimi did an excellent job with the directing...though it would've been interesting to see James Cameron direct this, like he was first supposed to. And Danny Elfman provides a wonderful, haunting score. Elfman is no John Williams or James Horner, but he does a good job in his own right. ... All in all, \\"Spider-Man\\" is an awesome film and should be seen by all fans of Spidey! It was rated PG-13 for some very mild lanuage, some violence, and a few scary moments. I wouldn't really recommend it for very young children, but I think it is appropriate for people ages 7 and up.<br />Final Grade: A+
B00003CXE7|4.0|By the time I'm writing this review, this movie is already two years old.  However, I feel that the DVD creates such a strong presence for a film with excellent technical values that it can't go unrecognized.<br />Odds are you've already seen this movie (or you already know what it's about), so I'll skip that part.  The story of how aa man loses power and then fights for revenge, while inadvertently gaining popularity, is a cliched story that reminds me of the E! True Hollywood Story on Hulk Hogan.  However, the film features powerful performances all around (especially from scene-stealing Phoenix) and a Rocky-esque script that will have you interested for the most part.  But the real cool thing about this movie is the action.  It's expertly directed (thanks to Ridley Scott) and is everything that action should be: action-packed.  The many action scenes contain graphic violence and copious blood-shedding, which adds to the film's off-the-charts entertainment factor.  (It's an action movie after all.  Have a sense of humor!)<br />The film's Oscar-winning sound and visual effects are done justice in a big way.  The picture quality is excellent and provides a very film-like experience.  Colors are deep and well-saturated, but never bleed.  Blood spews across the screen and creates a very convincing experience.  Modest edge enhancement can't be ignored (at least not by me), but all in all, this is a near-reference quality disc with only one minor quibble from me.  Watch this film on the biggest, widest TV you can find.  The film's theatrical aspect ratio of 2:35.1 is preserved and is presented anamorphically.<br />Now here's where it gets REALLY good: the sound.  Lord in Heaven, this has to be one of the greatest soundtracks ever burned onto a DVD.  Presented in DTS-ES and Dolby Digital EX, this is THE demo disc.  Surrounds used all the time (even in quiet scenes) and the ambient effects are exceptional.  During the battle scenes, swords clash, chariots turn over, fleshis pierced, and a bunch of white guys scream.  It's an audiophile's wet dream and shouldn't be missed.  The bottom end is extremely powerful and will give your subwoofer a good run.  Damn, this is a good mix.  The DTS is better due to more controlled bass, but both give you a big bang for your buck.  There is also a Dolby Surround 2.0 track.

B00005JL3A|2.0|There is only one brief moment in Paul W.S. Anderson's misguided film of Resident Evil in which he actually captures the awesomely creepy atmosphere of the original games. It's when we first meet Milla Jovovich's character, dazed and amnesiac, waking up in the shower in a dark and deserted mansion. It's also the only scene that can reasonably be termed \\"horror.\\" For most of the rest of the film, Anderson tries to capture a riff similar to that of James Cameron's Aliens...and fails. Sure, there are specific elements of the game introduced here and there (like the skinned-looking zombie dogs), but what on earth kind of zombie movie is it that has NO GORE!? Perhaps fearing those prudes at the MPAA, Anderson gives us close-ups of muzzle flashes in the gun-battle scenes when any REAL zombie movie would be bestowing its special make-up effects crew with the latest means of molding exploding heads. Make no mistake, this is an action movie, not a horror movie, and not a particularly tense or original one, borrowing as it does from every \\"bunch of folks getting picked off one by one\\" plot that's come down the pike. (For a movie that's almost identical to this one but actually remembers to be good cheesy fun, try John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars.) There is, now that I remember it, one other shot that reminded me of the game, and that was the final one in which Milla is gazing out upon the Raccoon City street littered with burning cars and wreckage. It's a sign that Anderson could have actually made a Resident Evil movie if he'd wanted to, but he just didn't. I told myself I'd give this DVD a rental if it proved to be an extended unrated director's cut, with excised blood-n-guts restored, but it looks like this \\"special edition\\" is going to be nothing more than the sanitized-for-your-protection theatrical edit after all. So game over, man.
B00000099Y|5.0|Many people consider this to be Tool's best cd.  They may think so, but I am sure that Lateralus is the best.  This is, however, definitely an awesome cd, full of great songs, heavy guitars, and Maynard James Keenan's great voice.  Tool always focuses on music before lyrics, which is good and bad, due entirely to the fact that Maynard has quite the voice.  The instrumentals, however, like Danny Carey's complex drumming and Adam Jones' majestic guitar, make the music much better.  Justin Chancellor's bass is great, too, but the others stand out more. This cd has a load of good songs, but the best ones are track 1: Stinkfist, track 7: Hooker With a P*nis, and track 9: Jimmy. The music itself has almost every element of progressive metal thrown into the mix, making everything about it stand out in a good way.  Another thing that some people will notice about Tool is that they don't sound like other bands.  They're music is bounced in good ways, played with much passion, and comes out in a way that sounds so great and makes sure that Tool only sound like themselves.  The best thing about the music is that even the most diehard fan doesn't know what they will do next.  This cd is focused and displays the best that a band can give, so buy it if you like original-sounding rock/metal.
0790729369|4.0|Pretty much everyone on the planet knew years before \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" that Meryl Streep could do any accent under the sun and put on an acting clinic. However, the acting revelation in this film is Clint Eastwood, although ironically I have always had the feeling that he is not really acting. I mean, from the Man With No Name to Dirty Harry to William Munny the man has played some of the most hard-bitten characters around. I try to remember the last romantic lead Eastwood played off the top of my head and all that comes to mind is \\"Paint Your Wagon.\\" Yet as photographer Robert Kincaid he is warm, charming, engaging, in other words, pretty much everything I would like to think the real Clint Eastwood is like in the real world. No wonder Francesca falls for him.<br />The story takes place in the summer of 1965, when Francesca's husband and kids are off to the Iowa State Fair. Francesca, an Italian war bride who sometimes misses the old country, is planning on a few days of peace and quite when Robert Kincaid shows up in a pick up truck asking for directions to one of those covered bridges that are all over the place in Madison County. It turns out he is on assignment from the National Geographic magazine to photograph them and when Francesca agrees to help it is the quiet beginning to a four-day romance of epic proportions. There is a framing device for the tale, which takes place after Francesca has died, in which Francesca's children find her journal and read for the first time of the secret affair their mother enjoyed, but for the most part this just gets in the way. Certainly the knowledge of how this affair will end impacts our level of emotional involvement with the two lovers.<br />Admittedly, this is one of the great hit or miss romance films of our generation. It will either click for you or it will not. But I think you have to check it out at least once just to catch a glimpse of the \\"real\\" Eastwood. Note: If you get a change, check out the audio-tape version of the novel, which is narrated by author Robert James Waller with the dialogue for the two leads done by Ben Kinsley and Isabelli Rossalini.

B00005QXDD|5.0|Ever since I saw High Fidelity (one of the greatest and most underrated movies ever) I have been a huge Jack Black fan.  Picking up this CD was a good decision.  It's got such a great sound on all the songs.  Sometimes it sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd (&quot;The Road&quot;) sometimes AC/DC (&quot;Dio&quot;) and sometimes like Crosby, Stills and Nash (&quot;Tribute&quot;)  It's all these great classic rock band sounds but with all this humor.  The funniest track by far is &quot;Inward Singing.&quot;  I heard this in the car and started laughing so hard I almost cried.  This CD seems immature at times, and often foolish, but you know what?  Back off.  Jack Black is rampant in all of us.  Let this CD bring the JB out in you.  It's funny, the songs are actually pretty darn good, and it's like nothing you've heard since the days of Hendrix, Zeppelin and Skynyrd.  Pop it in, you won't be sorry.

044022425X|5.0|I have fallen in love with this series.  It is well worth allowing yourself to be taken away by the saga.  This book moves the story of Claire and Jamie through America.  Looking for good summer reading, you won't be disappointed here (although I recommend you start with Outlander and move through the series in sequence).  Another world awaits you here!
B00005YUNY|5.0|It was only a matter of time before Yes performed with a symphony, really, but it's unlikely even the most devoted Yes fans will be prepared for the powerful performances on this DVD. From a technological standpoint, this has to be the highest-quality live recording of a Yes concert I have ever heard, particularly when heard in DTS; it doesn't exactly put House of Blues or Keys to Ascension to shame, but it is head and shoulders above either of those DVD's in crystal clarity. The 16:9 videography is sharp and well-edited, too.<br />..., Howe's two solo guitar pieces are beautifully performed, although the Vivaldi piece stands out simply because Howe has done Mood for a Day to death. (Thank goodness he didn't do the equally overdone Clap.) Of the live pieces, Gates of Delirium and Starship Trooper have enormous strength with the orchestral backing, and newer tracks such as Magnification and In the Presence Of fit right in to the classic repertoire seamlessly. In all, a staggering concert from a band that, at its age, one might think burned out and ready to pack it in; instead, they sound revitalized and ready to go another 30 years!<br />Disc 2 of this DVD, sadly, is kind of superfluous. There's a throwaway video for Don't Go (off the Magnification album), and the tour documentary has some fun behind the scenes stuff but little depth, and most fans won't likely watch it more than once. But it doesn't negatively affect this item's overall rating, because the set is so inexpensive and the concert itself is worth the price alone.
6304457391|4.0|<BR>SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is a film about the clear relationship that exists between the civilian, elected government of the United States and its military. In this country, the President usually consults with his military on matters of national security, and respects their collective opinion, but when it is time to decide, he has only his own conscience to listen to. All dispute, all disagreement between him and them is supposed to vanish. But what if elements of the military decided to ignore this bit of constitutional law to achieve their goals and circumvent his? That is the premise of SEVEN DAYS IN MAY. To those who believe in liberty and its preservation, such a thought is unsettling. Director John Frankenheimer portrays a contemporary American society not unlike many such past and present ones, one that is sharply split between what the public and the military want but that which the President opposes. General Scott, played with a steely, no nonsense air by Burt Lancaster, is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Scott is convinced that the President (Frederic March) is leading the country to ruin via a foolish disarmorment policy that in Scott's opinion will leave America helpless against the Soviets. He plans a military coup in which he will assume the Presidency, but word leaks out to one of his subordinates, Colonel Casey (Kirk Douglas) who spends much of the movie trying to decide what to do, and having decided that, to convince the President of the validity of the threat. Ultimately, the President, with the aid of some underhanded dealing by Colonel Casey, squashes the threat and forces the resignation of all the top officers involved in the coup.<BR>SDM is a response to the cold war threat of the 50s and 60s that might come not from the barrels of the Russians but from the smoke filled rooms of traitors plotting against the red, white, and blue. As the viewer listens to the reasons given by General Scott as he realizes that his plot has been uncovered, the viewer can sense the hollowness of Scott's arguments. As the President responds that General Scott is free to change the status quo, there are constitutional means to do so. 'Run for office,' the President thunders, 'if you want to sit in my chair.' Scott can make no effective counter as he leaves the room to a forced retirement. This movie asks Americans to question just how far they should go in good conscience when they strongly disapprove of the actions of the elected civilian leaders. The answer is simple: Run for office and change things within the system. To do otherwise would leave a government with an American name but without American ideals.
B00005QG9J|5.0|To tell you the truth, I became hooked on this thing called \\"incubus\\" by the song \\"drive\\".  The sound was all good, but sometimes it's not all about sound-for me it was the line \\"water over wine\\" which hit me on a higher vibration.  Which is neat about this \\"incubus\\" group.  I think what all their fans have in common is that their music makes you feel good because \\"morning view\\" touches on so many different emotions.  I sense anger \\"nice to know you\\", a slice of reflective happiness \\"wish you were here\\", depression \\"mexico\\", unity \\"are you in\\", and peaceful death \\"aqueous transmission\\". When I listen to \\"morning view\\" I feel like the lead singer is my guide, taking me on a tour of different emotions against the scenery and backdrop of the music, which is very subtle...then throw in some beautifully trippy space sounds...and wala!!!...the alien in me is free!!!
0151003084|4.0|When I was little I liked the band Everclear. I found this book by listing to an interview of the band and hearing the lead singer say that the man holding the umbrella on the cover of this book was the same man on the tattoo on his arm. I have to admit the book scared me when I was little(around 11), Im 15 now and I re-read it and it seems to be rather funny now that Im more grown up. While this is not a childrens book, I would recoment it to any adult with a twisted sense of humor. Not twisted, but...open minded and ready for anything. The illistrations are priceless and its an all around pretty decent book.<br />Not recomemed for children under 11 years of age.
0691023565|5.0|It's delightful to see this book is still in bookstores after 60 years, and I can still remember how much fun it was to read it 30 years ago. I came across it recently in a local bookstore, and after poring over it again, I was inspired to write a little review about it.<br />The most important thing about the book is Polya's little heuristic method for breaking down math problems and guiding you thru the process of solving them. Try to visualize the problem as a whole. Diagram it at first, even if you don't have all the details. Just initially try to get the most important parts of the problem down. Then try to get some sense of the relationship of the parts to the whole. Then tackle each of the component parts. If you get stuck, ask yourself if you could approach it another way, what could be missing, and so on. To this end, the questions at the back of the book are worth their weight in gold.<br />Polya's little heuristic and methods book is a timeless classic. This and Lancelot Hogben's &quot;Mathematics for the Millions&quot; have done more good for suffering math students than all the the dry textbooks put together that really don't teach you &quot;how to solve it.&quot;
0688170528|5.0|The subject made me leary of venturing into this book but for the bookgroup I did it and was pleased with the story.  Great job of writing, as usual for Jodi Picoult, makes this book read easy.  Hats off to the research done here; it was done well.  Having a 15 year old son I can attest to the correctness of attitude by the character Chris (up and down, loving child and frightened young adult all in one body).  This is a sad story but I believe well worth reading.
B00005PJ8I|4.0|The job that one has makes it likely that one will develop a personality that is a function of that job.  In Robert Zemeckis' CAST AWAY, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) plays a FedEx executive whose life revolves around the clock.  If a package is late for delivery, someone under his command will catch hell.  For him, time is a precious commodity, and can be measured by the units of the clock, not by the ticks of the heart.  This is his life, and he and his fiancee, played briefly by Helen Hunt, do not seem unhappy with that.  His life changes and not just because he is cut off from the world for five years as he is marooned on a tropical island after a plane crash.  Most critics who comment on the movie point out that CAST AWAY is really an allegory of man's struggle for survival in an inhospitable environment against long odds.  Now certainly there is that subtext, but if that is the major point of the film, then why bother to have the first part where he is time driven or the last part where he seeks to re-establish emotional roots that were uprooted years before?  I see a different message: people are a function of their environment, which shapes their behavior, their food, their entertainment, their relations, or even their self-image.  This shaping imprints itself strongly with time, and a change of environment does not result in an immediate change within. The body and the soul need time to 'catch up.'  For Chuck Noland, his years on the island served to whittle away his outer shell of a clock-based life.  Slowly, he learns to eat, to swim, to care for his teeth in a rhythm dictated by the stars overhead, not by the watch that he misses more than all else.  When he miraculously reappears in his former life, he has to reset his internal clock once again.  The scene in which he plays with a match in his hotel room, lighting it effortlessly, producing a flame that he could not on his island, point out that though he is now in a hotel room, his mind has not yet made thetemporal leap from the island.  It may take years for him to readjust himself, as the concluding scene with the pretty girl with the truck indicates. But he might, and this lesson in the slow acceptance of how changes in life cause changes in behavior resonate more powerfully than merely pondering the survival techniques of the latest Robinson Crusoe.
0553277472|5.0|This book is a must read.  It definitely was ahead of its time when it was published, and based on the conscientiousness of those around me, it still feels ahead of its time...which is why I deem this a classic...it's the type of book you could read over and over again, and continue to feel new neuron connections forming in your brain every time...things seem to get prettier and prettier...  This book I hold on to for my daughter and her future siblings...
B0000203Y5|5.0|This video is wonderful if all you know about Cuban music is Buena Vista Social Club.  However, if you can find the video called \\"Lagrimas Negras,\\" which was made before BVSC and is often shown on WorldLinkTv, you'll quickly see that BVSC is a direct rip-off of an earlier video about a different group of son musicians.  By all means, enjoy this video, but use it to explore deeper into traditional Cuban music.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Everyone is slaming Britney about her lastest C.D. A lot of her songs go along with the same kind of beat, which is the only down side I can see. The only song without a lot of bass is \\" I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", which is a beautiful song I may add. Her C.D. is just showing that she's done with growing up; she's not 16 anymore. She should have put another song with a soft tone to make it more well rounded. \\"I'm A Slave For You,\\" is a song that stands out. A lot of artists' music is really similar, but this song has its own style. If you think Britney Spears has gross lyrics, then you obviously haven't listened to Destiny's Child or Pink. \\"Bombastic Love\\" has a great beginning ping, and \\"Overprotected\\" has lyrics that hook you. The C.D. isn't as good as her earlier ones, but it is still a good buy. The only problem with it is that the bass is a little overcoming.
6304711905|5.0|Ok, I'm aware this movie isn't historically accurate. If you're that hung up on fact, you won't get into this movie. But for sheer entertainment, you won't find a more engaging, clever film. The two major highlights: Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday- he looked every bit the consumed, wry, witty and intelligent extremely proficient gunslinger. And second: the best ever quotable lines since \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\"! Check out Curly Bill emerging from the opium den, waving his arms as if at a Grateful Dead concert, declaring \\"I feel...CAPITAL\\". Try this out on your friends at the end of of a night on the town. Or better, Doc Holiday's cynical \\" I have not yet BEGUN to defile myself\\" -the catch phrase at our last New Year's Eve Party. This movie will crack you up, and make you cry like a baby. It has it's wistful moments and shoot em full of lead moments and it is truly one of the few movies that I can stand to watch more than once. And it transcends the term \\"western\\"- everyone will like this film.
B00000K3CR|5.0|Every kid has dreams of what it would be like to grow up. Usually these thoughts revolve around the material things in life, most of which include adult-type possessions like money, girls, and cars. In director Penny Marshall's BIG, Tom Hanks gives an eminently believable performance as a 13 year old boy who makes the full circle from boy to man and back to boy. Although the audience has great fun with the many truly funny scenes, the real charm of the film is not the humor of a fish out of water but the growth of a boy who has a glimpse of what it is to be a man and yet can possess the wisdom to recognize that he is not ready to permanently stay an adult if it means losing the experience that should have accompanied that growth.<BR> The youth Josh Baskin (David Moscow) makes a wish to be an adult at one of those carny magic fortune teller machines. Right away the audience is swooped into one of two realms: the benign universe of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or the more malignant one of the TWILIGHT ZONE where William Shatner is fed life- altering decisions by a machine that could be a clone of this one. But BIG is a sweet comedy and the audience can sense that there will indeed be comic complexities caused by Josh's getting his wish in a literal way that provides unexpected consequences. <BR>Josh, now played by Tom Hanks, uses his charm, his youth, his zest for things juvenile to land an adult job. The core of the comedy revolves around a succession of scenes that requires a delicate balancing act for Hanks. He must try to act like an adult but still retain the mannerisms of a child. The best scenes in which he accomplishes this include the dancing on the piano scene with Robert Loggia and the more adult relationship he forges with Elizabeth Perkins, who falls for the child that she sees in the man. No one else in Hollywood could have pulled this off. <BR> Josh builds a life as an adult. He has all the 'toys' that he thought all adults did, but inwardly his child rebels,causing him to want to experience life but not on the cheap. Experience, he learns, is dear, and it is not enough for others to give him credit for accomplishments that they presume is the result of a more natural emotional and physical accumulation of experience. Rather, he learns that life is sort of like those goofy electronic make-up-your-life-as-you-go toys that he developed as a marketing whiz. You can push a button and get the desired result, but once having done so, the reality on the screen does not match the reality in the heart. And for the young Josh or the old Josh or the audience, this is a very adult lesson indeed.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I buy a huge amount of CD's a year. They spend some time (usually a week) in my CD player and eventually end up on the CD rack to await occasional play.  However, &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; is not going to be put away anytime soon.  In fact, I have been playing the disc in the car as well.  <BR>I have found it to be refreshing and different compared to the standard summer albums that have been coming out.  Norah Jones' voice is beautiful and very unique.  The songs are lowkey but enjoyable.  That is a huge compliment coming from a guy who usually skips over the slow tracks.
B000063S6Z|3.0|I liked Play because it was an upbeat album with many happy songs in it. Even though the lyrics in Play were often grim, the melodies that accompanied them were usually inspiring. 18 sounds depressing at most points. It clearly has lots of influence from Moby's earlier album Ambient. The songs in this album are not pop-radio hits that DJs will play over and over again, with the exception of Jam For The Ladies and possibly one or two others.
B00006690G|5.0|BACK AGAIN! SHADY'S BACK! TELL A FRIEND! Eminem fans across the globe will be delighted to hear that Eminem is more popular than ever. Though the cussing hasn't disappeared from his music, the talented rapper continues to put out music that (most) people can appreciate. What is so special about him is that he tells things that are true, even the ones we would rather not hear. His content is more controversial than ever with the decidedly unpatriotic and angering record \\"White America\\" to the softly sung ode to his daughter, \\"Hailie's Song\\". It just shows that the man is full of vastly different emotions and thoughts. The rhymes have improved since his last album, the famous Marshall Mathers LP. The beats are good for the most part, though some beats are tiring. The only problem with this album is that he talks way too much about his daughter. I think we all get the picture, and he doesn't need to clarify the fact that he loves his daughter so much. It just gets annoying after a while. Other than that, I'm sure that this album will continue to be heard until he puts out another album.<br />Curtains Up- Introduction with Eminem walking up to the stage. <br />White America- Unpatriotic, but despairingly true. Eminem disses Ms. Cheney, Tipper Gore, and America in general.<br />Business- Okay, featuring Dr. Dre. First part of song deals with Eminem's recent fantasy of Batman and Robin.<br />Cleaning Out My Closet- Another song about dissing his mother and family problems.<br />Square Dance- Stupid, gets on your nerves quickly.<br />The Kiss (skit)- Vaguely re-enacts Eminem's arrest for pistol whipping Kim's lover.<br />Soldier- Violent, shows Eminem's gangsta side.<br />Say Goodbye to Hollywood- Okay. Chorus is stupid.<br />Drips- So-so. Featuring Obie Trice. Deals with women.<br />Without Me- I think everybody has heard this one. Eminem bashes Limp Bizkit, Moby, his mom, Elvis fans, and Chris Kierpatrick.<br />Paul Rosenberg (skit)- Paul, Eminem's legal advisor, asks Eminem not to carry his gun.<br />Sing For The Moment- Song about Eminem's fans. Very insightful.<br />Superman- Sequel to Drug Ballad on MMLP. About Eminem's view of women, no that he's not married anymore.<br />Hailie's Song- I think we can figure out what this song is about. Eminem admits he can't sing, then attemps to do it anyway. The most conservative song on the album.<br />Steve Berman (skit)- Funny. Eminem shoots Berman, thinking that he is angry about the album (again).<br />When The Music Stops- Deals with the responsibilities of a music artist. Featuring D12.<br />Say What You Say- Jermaine Dupri diss. Featuring Dr. Dre.<br />'Till I Collapse- Eminem sums up the album. One of the best songs on the album. Featuring Nate Dogg, who does a good job with the chorus.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy- Conclusion of the album. Eminem mentions September 11 for the first time. Featuring Hailie Jade (sigh).<br />Curtains Close- Hilarious. Ken Kaniff makes his first appearance on the album. The only song that has to do with homosexuality on the album.
B00005A1VH|5.0|By 1941, Europe had been in armed conflict ever since German tanks rolled into Poland in 1939.  In hindsight, England, a beaten France, and a Soviet Russia then learning the true meaning of Blitzkrieg all could see that the Germany of 1935 through 1939 had been busy preparing for a war of conquest.  In America, Hollywood too had long since cast off its blinders and its top producers knew that another, far more terrible Great War was just around the corner.  SERGEANT YORK was one of a handful of movies that Hollywood managed to crank out before the eye-opening event of December 7, 1941.<BR>     To prepare America for this newest war, Hollywood tapped director Howard Hawks to reach back some quarter century to resurrect a genuine war hero who could stand tall for a new generation.  This hero was Alvin York, a man who won numerous medals from both his own country and France for his single-handed capture of more than one hundred German soldiers and his killing in combat of dozens more.  What made York even more heroic than his deeds suggest is that at the time that he was drafted in 1917, he was a Bible-reading pacifist who was sure that he could not kill another man in anger.  Hawks chose Gary Cooper to play York.  Cooper was the natural choice; he looked like York, could speak like York, and most important, Cooper was then an established film icon whose unwavering moral compass made clear in all his previous films marked him as York's soul brother.  <BR>       The movie details York's home life in Tennessee.  He is pictured as a young man whose principles were beyond question. True, he was also seen as a hick type, but that was not necessarily a bad thing.  America then was far more rural then urban and very many Americans could instantly relate to his homespun and simplistic philosophy.  Cooper plays York as a man who has to struggle with some divergent choices that all young men in all wars must face.  Can he kill when ordered?  At first, he says no, and he is labeled a Conscientious Objector.  One of the film's most stirring scenes is not one of shooting combat at all, but of emotional combat.  His officers can see in York the making of a fine soldier, and one of them engages him in a quiet conversation whose moral significance belies its decorum.  This officer rightly respects York's beliefs, but tells him that the gods of war cannot be ignored or trifled with.  York replies that he will 'chew things over.' And so he does as the middle part of the movie places him in France.  York and his comrades are surrounded by Germans and their lives are in mortal peril.  If York holds on to his beliefs, he and his comrades will die.  He makes a decision that the film suggests is not a sudden one, but one that has had an evolutionary genesis.  He decides to shoot back and to kill.  And kill he does.  He picks off one German after another with his deadly rifle fire.  He captures an entire regiment and delivers his prisoners to his superiors.  For this he gets a medal, a ticker tape parade in New York, and the opportunity for commercial product endorsements.  The movie ends happily with York marrying his hometown sweetheart.<BR>       Cooper's portrayal of York not only solidified his stature as the leading actor of the day, but his convincing earnestness of his choice helped Hollywood prepare America for the day that it knew that a new generation of Alvin Yorks might just have to make that same choice.

0449002632|5.0|London by Edward Rutherfurd is a work of historical fiction. Most impressive, is how much factual history one can learn when reading this book. It's so subliminal that you don't realize exactly how much you've learned by the time you've finished reading the 836 pages. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed reading the book so much.<br />London is the story of the evolution of the titled city. It begins before the time of Roman occupation, when the Celts ruled the land, and ends in 1997. London grows from an abandoned outpost, to a medieval marketplace, to the metropolis it is today. Along the way you follow the rise and fall of a few fictitious families: The Bulls with their stubbornness, the Duckets/Doggets with the occasional flash of white in their hair and webbed fingers, the Silversleeves most noted for their rather long nose, the Barnikels whose rich Viking ancestry remains with them and the Flemings who always seem to know how to go with the flow. Rutherfurd uses these five families as the cornerstone of his novel, as he follows their descendants from generation to generation, through richer and poorer, through the highs and the lows. I'm quite thankful that Rutherfurd included a genealogy. Keeping track of people over 2000 years can get a bit confusing, but this doesn't happen with London. A reference to an ancestor or a suggestion of a family trait is subtly woven in to keep you on track.<br />It is through the eyes of these families that Rutherfurd shows us the evolution of London. We are transported to the times of the Romans with their grand architecture and organization. We learn how the Battle of Hastings in 1066 changed their lives, we are shown how the break from the Roman church tore the city apart, and how a civil war, outbreak of plague, and a disastrous fire can reshape a city. And who can forget the age of Gloriana? And as we read about each event, we come across actual people, places, and turning stones, which is where the learning part comes in. It wasalmost like reading a textbook about the history of England, but more effective because it was related to those five families. As a true dork to the core, I fell in love with this book. Each time I would get to a new section I felt that the many hours of reading and studying had truly paid off. Since I'm a history major, whenever I would come across a familiar name, time period or event I would secretly smile to myself and see just how accurate Rutherfurd would be. He did not leave me disappointed.<br />Instead, after 836 pages, I wanted more. Rutherfurd has written two more novels set in England and one in Russia. These books are at the top of my wishlist. For fans of historical fiction who are longing for a book in this genre that doesn't feature a Fabio prototype on the cover and oozing with drippy romance, I strongly recommend London. It will not leave you disappointed either.
B000002KP3|5.0|This album marks the transition of hippy Marc to Glam rock Marc being finally completed. Alas, it also marked the last straw for many who had idolised him from the early days when he, and Steve Peregrine Took, had travelled the length and breadth of England like elfin troubadors.<br />In essence though, the music of Marc Bolan never really changed. Perhaps the lyrics were less eloquent, some would say less pretentious, perhaps the tunes were less complex, some might say more boogie but the same imaginative characters were always to be found.<br />With this album, Marc Bolan finally became a rock star, completing the process which the public first caught a glimpse of with' By the Light of a Magical Moon' on Beard of Stars. He turned out to be a pretty good rock star too and despite any pretensions to the contrary he has been a great influence on the development of British music since then.<br />This album in many ways is the pinnacle of Marc Bolan's achievement. It has a good rhythm throughout, there are some immortal hits, instantly recognisable, it is transgenerational, it is great to play at weddings and is immensly danceable. Standout tracks are the perennial favourites, Jeepster, Bang a Gong, Life's a Gas and, being the age that I am I have always been a stickler for songs like 'Cosmic Dancer'<br />Tony Visconti, as with all of the Tyrannosaurus Rex albums, does an excellent job of production.<br />This is a classic rock album, as if by accident, given a new lease of life through Billy Elliot.
0451167716|5.0|The enduring impact of any novel can be measured only decades after its release.  The publishing business is replete with hot bestsellers of the day, but have long since faded from public consciousness.  Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER is certain to occupy that middle ground between the timeless classics of Faulkner, Hemingway, and Fitzgerald and those of the still popular general favorites of Margaret Mitchell and Stephen King.  When one looks at the ingredients for a novel with staying power, whatever ingredients one finds, surely THE GODFATHER has them.  Discounting the obvious: gripping prose, character evolution, sex paired off with violence, strong protagonists, quirky secondary characters, and memorable lines, the primary element that gives the book as much interest today as when it was first released is that Puzo declares that there is a universal world order to things that man in his greed, his stupidity, his viciousness cannot long deter.  This world order is the family.  It matters not if the family is nuclear or extended.  At the core of each family must be the patriarch, a Vito Corleone, who must have the vision to plan for his family and their future.  The patriarch does not pay attention to such petty details as government law.  What counts is his law that perpetuates his vision unto the next several generations.  The difference between success in governments and families and failure in them lies not in geography, economics, or even religion, but in whether the alpha-male patriarch can combine purpose with vision.  Puzo often makes the point clear.  The Godfather wonders how it was possible for the Nazis to grab power only to waste their resources in a war that if he had orchestrated, Germany would have triumphed.  He looks at the competing families and their respective crime bosses.  During a meeting following Sonny's execution by the same people he now addresses, he is mature enough a patriarch not to let personal animosity get in the way of good business.  He sees that the other Mafia chiefs have numerous flaws: money, women, style, all of which mark them as unfit to propagate their progeny.  In his own family, two sons out of three are unfit.  It is only Michael, the 'good' son, that Vito Corleone sees as worthy to wear the mantle.  The inner tragedy of the GODFATHER is that to develop the vision that Don Corleone deems necessary to rule his family, the heir apparent must lose himself in the vision of another, thereby cutting himself off from his own unbuilt legacy.  It is this sense of family, vision, and twisted legacy that has enthralled readers for decades.  A vision lost is a timeless tragedy.
B0000524CY|5.0|When I first saw the Exorcist it was late at night and I was watching the last forty-five minutes, and I was convinced to buy<br />it the next day.  As I watched it from the beginning, I got bored,but not for long.  The flashes with that demon face was enough to give me nightmarish thoughts during daylight.  Linda Blair did superb job as Regan, the girl posessed by the devil(or something close to it).  The crawl down the stairs had me freaked.  And I had seen the other two Exorcist movies before the original.  I recommend this movie to anyone with a strong stomach, and doesn't scare easy.

It's possible to empathise with Mr Darcy's concerns about Elizabeth's family while sharing her irritation at his &quot;arrogant presumption&quot; (AND admire the Bennett breakfast setting). Thoroughly enjoyable on repeated viewings this rates as one of my all-time favourites.
B00000ILGB|5.0|Amon Duul were a German collective who split thus Amon Duul and Amon Duul II. Whereas the former were more politically involved and wanted to be closer to the people, II focussed on raising the people's awareness through the music. Inspired in part by the Grateful Dead, in part by Pink Floyd, Amon Duul were very much part of the nascent Krautrock scene in Germany.<br />Yeti, along with the first Ash Ra Tempel album, are representative of the psychedelic side of the German scene. Another reviewer appears somewhat critical of aspects of the album but given the situation at the time in Europe, it is not clear to non-Brits why this was such an innovative album.<br />For a start most German bands were guys. Amon Duul had non-descript female vocals but II had Renate. Influences here included Yoko Ono, Grace Slick, Janis Joplin and the Teutonic goddess Nico. The combination of the vocals, the guitar effects and the focus on improvisation marked this band out from almost every other aside from Can.<br />Yeti is the gem in the crown of their work. One of the earliest European albums to include recorded improvisational material, Yeti occupied one complete side of the album. At the time they were little known outside of Germany although there was a growing awareness by a small cognescenti in Britain due to the connections with members of the psychedic warlords, Hawkwind.<br />In a sense the track listings do not really matter as the album was intended to be a reflection of their live gigs but aside from the title track, two others standout. Archangels Thunderbird became a crowd favourite much to the disdain of the band reportedly at the time but was included in many gigs and appeared in Live in London. The last side of the vinyl album devoted to Yei, Yogi and Sandoz is a genuflection to the company who first created LSD and is played accordingly.<br />This is the last album which would capture the band in it's full improvisational glory. Thereafter there music became more complex much in line with other developments on the music scene at home.lex much in line with other developments on the music scene at home.
B00004VXF2|5.0|This is the type of album that rewards repeated listenings, but unfortunately I haven't had the patience to make it through even once.  But that's OK, even the artist himself has never heard this album.  And therein lies its briliance, it's unadulterated mastery.  Many have favorably compared this masterwork to such avant-garde milestones as Cage, Stockhausen, LaMonte Young, and even make the (specious) comparisons to Eno and Reich. As an artistic statement, Reed tops the competition with a very well manufactured CD that arrives without scratches or blemishes of any kind. From beginning to end, Reed's CD operates as a reflection of the emotional state of the listener, from base to sublime.  Just look at that CD.  See that reflection? In so many ways, Reed answers the questions in 1978 that Elvis posed in 1956.  If he got the answers wrong, so what?  If you only have one CD in your collection, this may be it.
B00005JHCP|4.0|This film is true to the main story line of the book.  It does leave out some of the subplots and characters, like Tommy Traddles, Dr Strong, the schoolmaster Mell, etc.  But the story doesn't suffer too much because of it.  The characters are very well cast.  Copperfield (boy and man), Aunt Betsy, Mr Dick, Macawber, Uriah Heep, all look (more or less) as they do in your mind's eye when you read the book.  <br />The only problem with the film is it loses the charm of the book.  The young David's innocence when he first ventures out in the world (think of the waiter who 'shares' David's first tavern meal), and the maturing David's embarrasment as he first steps out in life as a young man (think of Copperfield's apprehension about Steerforth's valet, or his first infatuations with some local girls and then, of course, his courting of Dora); these are the things that were so charming in the book because they were lovingly drawn by Dickens' from his own early life experiences.  None of this comes through in the film.<br />Still, not a bad film.  You get the main story, you see the main characters, all pretty well done.  But read the book, too, if you want to know what David Copperfield really is.
B00005JKNC|2.0|No one has slammed this movie hard enough, from what I can tell. First off, the issue of Jim Carrey. He's a funny guy. Can also act. We knew this. But to have him do neither in this movie is unconscionable. There's nothing in his character that Jim Carrey could give any of himself to. As has been said here before, anyone could have been in this role, thats how uninvolving it is.     Way too long. The drama doesnt start bulding until an hour has passed. Tear jerking is employed. Youre going to have to bring your Suspens-O-Matic to the viewing to process all the disbelief youll be experiencing regularly....the whole town following the reunited lovers...the whole town waiting at the platform when Carrey comes back from Congress...oh, phooey. This is clean family fun, I will admit, if youre an adult without a brain or a high tolerance level for the inane you might finish this two and a half hour affair. Thsi will be Jim Carrey's last film for a while.
0425170349|1.0|Tom Clancy is running out of bad guys and plausible situations.  The book opens with a potential terrorist attack on a passenger jetliner in flight.  Lo and behold, the world's top counter-terrorist team just happens to be there, in transit to their new headquarters in the United Kingdom.  <br />While Clancy is known for his intense action situations and eerily accurate military knowledge, I had to force myself to finish this book.  Will Tom Clancy kill off the ENTIRE WORLD?  Take a guess.  Read on as a group of highly intelligent scientists and doctors hatch a wholly ridiculous plan. Count how many times the authors use the word 'niggardly' and wonder why (I counted six). You're better off reading Clancy's 'Cardinal of the Kremlin'.  Strange to think that a video game would be better than the book it was based on.
630319656X|5.0|This delightful Opera combines Mozart's most beautiful music with five outstanding voices, plus the outstanding voice and acting of Teresa Stratas, as the funny Despina.  One cannot ask for more.  I am sorry that it is not available in DVD, but surely the powers that be will see the obvious need for this soon.  Fortunately for me, I was given the chance to see and hear this version of &quot;Cosi Fan Tutte&quot; by a good friend, and felt that I had to have it in my collection at once.  You will too.
0385720920|4.0|From the author of Fight Club comes a similar novel of twisted characters with lives only Palahnuik could invent. The story of Choke follows the events in a few months of Victor Mancini's life...an avid sex addict, a colonial fair worker, a part-time fake-choker, and so much more. The story unwinds and starts to piece together as you read to form an intricate tale of Victor's struggle to find meaning in his addict-drivin life. A hilarious (and very quick)read for any adult or mature teen looking for something with more honest substance than just about anything else in society today. Highly reccomended. (Warning::Several explicit sex sequences...funny but explicit)

6304938241|4.0|About halfway mark,like most HENRY JAMES novels,the story gets a little obvious to be entirely convincing,but along the way here's your chance to enjoy a decent story which profits from a good casting.Saying that HELENA BONHAM-CARTER is ideal in this type of role has become a clich,but it is so true.Cynic guys who want to watch this to see HELENA naked be patient,you'll get satisfaction near the end.The conclusion has the guy returning to VENISE,which means he won't marry KATE.Between you and me,how can a normal man refuse to marry a georgeous woman like BONHAM-CARTER?After watching this movie, i dreamed that HELENA was my sister and she was conforting me in the morning.Unfortunately,it was only a dream.
B00005N915|3.0|I tried to watch this film for the first time but had to turn it off after an hour due to boredom.  Then I watched the last half and the ending made it worth the wait.<br />This film is a catalyst for M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense.  Just as the exhiliration of comprehension crashes over you as all the subtleties of the movie float to the surface, so is the need to see the movie again to feel as though you appreciate all the fabulous foreshadowing that facilitates the plot.<br />Angel Heart is a fabulous movie and Robert DeNiro is deliciously creepy.  The fingernails were a bit unnecessary, I think, as the watcher would deem them odd, until the last 3 minutes of the film.  Altough I spent the whole movie wishing Mickey Rourke would take a shower and a shave, he was flawless in his portrayal of the tormented private eye who couldn't catch a break.  I especially loved the fact that protagonist and antagonist were combined into one character.  There's nothing more frustrating than pitying the really really bad guy!  <br />Lisa Bonet was very good and I'm sorry that she did not pursue a film career.  She would have offered much to the industry.
B00005O5CM|4.0|&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is lighthearted froth, a fun movie that carries you along so effortlessly that you may not realize the strong performance by Reese Witherspoon.  She hits and maintains just the right note in her portrayal of a California blonde who heads east to follow her boyfriend to, of all places, Harvard Law School.  As the plot unfolds, she leaves her legacy-prep love interest far behind as she discovers intellectual acuity and strength of her own.<br />  This movie is escapist-entertainment with a heart and with grit.  Highly recommended.

0446608955|5.0|This just has to be the sweetest, most uplifting love story ever. I reluctantly started it after my mother encouraged me to read it, and after the first twenty pages, I was hooked. The style of writing is so perfect for the story. It's not ostentatious, just sweet and simple.<br />Landon Carter is 17 years old, a high school senior in a small town. He's very well-off, but a rebel at heart. He doesn't like rules, and his friends are the same. Jamie is also 17, but as different as can be from Landon. She's the preacher's daughter, and is never seen doing anything but helping someone else. She always carries her Bible, and the Lord's plan is a favorite subject of discussion. After she does a favor for Landon, she asks him to star with her in the Christmas play her father wrote. That's when they get to know each other, and eventually fall in love, much to Landon's surprise. But Jamie has a secret, and it will inevitably put an end to their sweet romance if Landon doesn't do something-fast.<br />I can't think of anything that could have been done to improve this book. The only thing wrong with it was that it ended. I have to admit that I cried just BUCKETFULS while reading this. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
0380789035|2.0|After &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, I was looking forwards to &quot;American Gods&quot;.  Unfortunately it's not his best work.  Sure, all the cool stuff is there - new modern Gods of plastic and wire coming up against old ones of blood and trickery - but it's curiously un-compelling.  The whole book feels as it could have been more cohesive.  Many of the creatures and gods Shadow and Wednesday meet have little impact on the final showdown between the pantheons, and it makes the scenes episodic.  &quot;You know what would be cool?  If they met the original Easter.  And hey, genies are neat.  I'll write a short throwaway scene with them in it.&quot;  It feels like Gaiman just wanted to introduce as many different religious myths as he could.  And he HAS done his research, there's no mistake. I appreciate how much work has gone into looking it up - it's interesting so see just how OLD the variations on our myths are.  The problem is that they don't really flow into the plot, which is a bit thin as it is.  The climax reflects this: it makes sense in its way, and it's not TERRBILE.  But it'll leave you wanting something deeper, a little something more, especially from Neil when we know he can do better.<br />Another thing that fell flat were the new Gods of the modern age.  Aside from a few interesting scenes with Media not much of them stood out for me.  The Deity of the Internet, for example, was ripe with potential. He acts obnoxious in a few short scenes and then degenerates into gibbering.  It's disappointing.<br />Good points, well, hey, it does have its cool bits.  As I said, the research into religions shows and it adds some nice verisimilitude to the story.  The character interaction works, and it has some lovely descriptive scenes.  (The ones detailing the decay of Shadow's dead wife's body were particularly riveting) But in the end the flaws overbalanced the fun of reading it for me - It came off as a merely adequate piece of work, especially from Gaiman.  Some more editing would probably have netted it another star.  I wouldn't purchase it but simply take it out from the library.e editing would probably have netted it another star.

0596000480|4.0|I have to add my vote to those who feel this is an excellent resource, but that far too much important information (regular expressions, for example) is discussed in a narrative style that only hints at the actual syntax. Once you know the syntax, this book undoubtedly is a treasure -- but now I'm stuck having to find yet another resource to actually teach me how to make use of javascript (if I'd known, I would have read this book *after* doing some good turtorials).
0316666343|3.0|I agree with a few of the other reviewers on two fronts:  a)  the book is an easy, quick read that is both interesting and engaging and b)  I expected something greater based on the pre-marketing hype.  <br />I felt that Sebold could have left out the chapter where Susie had the opportunity to explore earthly moments (a la the movie &quot;Ghost&quot;) and left it a better book.  I found this particular chapter out of line with the character development and story line to that point.
B00005BF9Z|3.0|This is an eccentric, yet calculated, album. Each track smoothly transitions to the next, in a series of quirky and thematic segues. At times, the transitions are so subversive that it seems as though the same track has been playing for 15 minutes, which is quite annoying if you can't stomache a strong shot of cultured pop. The songs are mostly built around strong, upbeat rhythyms sprinkled with random sound effects. The lyrics range in Spanish, French, English and the occasional \\"Unidentifiable.\\" It is an excellent choice for taking a fast ride on a sunny day in a vehicle equipped with good speakers, or for background sounds while grilling on the patio. The music provokes more repetative head bobbing than creative thought, but serves as a neccesary evil. If you're going to drone out and listen to something reeking of Top 40, it may as well be as fresh and multilingual as \\"Esperanza.\\"
B00005JL3A|5.0|I think this movie is great.  As a fan of the game, I knew I would like it.  And I'm not sure if most people understand, but it takes place before the game Resident Evil.  By the time it's the end of the movie with that final scene where Milla picks up the shotgun, it is the time of Resident Evil 2 (you'd have to see the movie to know what I mean).  I think some people thought this was suppose to be based on the first game for Sony Playstation, but it's not.<BR>Milla Jovovitch and Michell Rodregez are great and I enjoy this movie every time I see it!
B000066NW0|5.0|As Avril Lavigne's Debut CD was unveiled on June 4, her fan base seems to be growing alongside her wide-spreading popularity.  While I wouldn't by any means categorize her style as \\"pop,\\" I also wouldn't give it any label. Avril's CD \\"Let Go\\" transpires labeling with its emotion filled and uniquely written tracks.  Every song has an issue that is addressed with true passion, leaving no room for objection that they were self-written.  <br />Anyone who enjoys the first single, \\"Complicated,\\" will be pleasantly surprised with the rest of the album.  Ranging from inquisitive, mellow ballads to more up front and in your face tracks, this CD is full of diversity.  There is a song to fit your every mood and ever-changing lifestyle.  <br />While some feel the usage of the lyrics may be slightly awkward, I feel this is completely necessary.  The manner in which they were written embodies everything she is trying to portray in this CD.  It assists the listener in imagining exactly what Avril is feeling and where she is coming from.  After all, if she were to change her writing style in order to please the media, it just wouldn't be the Avril her fans love.<br />I would say \\"Let Go\\" is helpful to those who don't have the talent to produce their own songs as an outlet to express what they are feeling. All in all, I strongly recommend this CD to anyone who needs a new and different outlook. Whether you are looking for a talented new artist, an overall good CD, or one that you just can't bear to take out of your stereo, \\"Let Go\\" is definitely for you.
0312265859|5.0|I still catch myself laughing out loud while reading Ms Evanovich's book so 5 stars it is.  I like the introduction of new character lawyer Klough and Lulu is still a \\"lulu\\". I do agree with negative reviewers in the need to broaden Stephanie's character.  She can be intelligent and still be surrounded by craziness.  As to romance it needs to move forward either put her with Morelli or let her have a big affair with Ranger.  I can see it either way, a Nick and Nora relationship with Morelli or I don't know what with Ranger!  Personally I can see Ranger pairing off completely out of type with an older homebody type just to make everyone wonder and be crazy. I will still be preordering my books.  So far this one has made the rounds of 2 friends with more waiting for their turn.
B00003CWNR|4.0|Well, although when I watched the movie I was but 14 yaers old,( I am now 16). I can say that I liked it! I know that you must be thinking &quot;what? this is a wierd kid&quot;, but the truth is that I have always had a certain inclination towards this kind of movie, and although i think that the book is much better, i think that the movie lives up to it enough for me to have enjoyed it. I always like the issue, both in the book and movie, and the superb acting in the movie makes the whole experience even more enjoyable. I recomend this movie to anyone who thinks they have enogh maturity to understand it and to take it seriousley, as did i. This goes for grown ups and youg people alike. thank you!
B00005JKQZ|3.0|About a third of the way through this movie, I thought it was setting up to be a classic... but, upon conclusion I concluded this movie is 'average'.  If you like technically sound movies, minus underlying emotional connection then I guess the movie is as dynamic as everyone has made it out to be.  I'll use a figure skating reference to analogize this film... Give it 6.0 for Technical Merit and 5.2 for Artistic Impression.   Maybe, you need to have experienced someone with profound mental illness to appreciate the film?  I'd be willing to bet most people's opinion has been slanted to the positive side due to the fact the idiot critics LOVED it.--The same critics who thought \\"INSTINCT\\" with Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. WASN'T a great film? (for the record...it was) 99+% of movie viewers are not critics, then why do we care what the critics think. They told us, The English Patient was great... was it?  I think you know the answer to that. Throw in Chocolat, too.-- Brutal. The movie is decent...It is not great.  I'm glad the critics LOVED it... I'm not a critic, except for this brief moment in time, where I too am an idiot.
B00005QIPH|2.0|I just can't say that I liked this very much. They are just not original at all. If this record had been released twenty five years ago, then it probably would have been great, but this has all been done before and usually much better. The songs when viewed strictly on there own merits aren't bad, but there is a certain monotony to this album that really wears on my nerves after a while. The singer's voice never variates from the same tone, and he seems to show absoluteley no emotion in any of the songs. It also seems like the guitarist plays the same riffs on every song. So, in conclusion, if you are thinking of buying this album, do yourself a favor and buy &quot;White Light/ White Heat&quot; or &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; first.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Well what can I say. Many people either hate Britney Spears or<BR>like her. In my opinion I liked her years ago but now I don't really care for her music. The music is catchy but the songs are the same. Its like listening to her whole album in one song. It is pretty annoying. But that is my opinion if your daughter or you enjoy Britney then hey buy the CD. I mean why me stop you. All I can say is please don't buy this CD if your child is under 10 years old b/c of the sexual content in the CD. I mean If you want your child to be hearing ima slave 4 you,dance up on me,hell, and swearing words then buy it lol. I just hope for better music in the future from Britney maybe a different beat.I know she can do better then this.
0375703861|3.0|While I am amazed that an author so young could write so knowledgably about life, I am saddened by the lives she depicts.  There is not one character in her entire novel who exemplifies strength, morality, or values.  Each one is a victim to his or her own personal \\"whines\\":  my father is too religious, my mother is too submissive, our family is too bent on its past.  I tired easily of the weaknesses I found present throughout this book.  No one was willing to accept responsbility for the consequences of their actions, because it's so much easier to blame someone, or something, else.  Most disappointing of all, to me, is the fact that (Indian) people who have immigrated to London want all the benefits that it has to offer, while at the same time disdaining the impurity of the West.  \\"It wasn't enough....his kids doing well, going to a nice school, having tennis lessons, too pale-skinned to ever have a hand laid on them in their lives.  Good. But not good enough.  He wanted a little payback.  For himself.  He wanted Brother Ibrahim to stand on that podium and dissect Christian culture and Western morals until it was dust in his hands.  He wanted the degenerate nature of these people explained to him...\\" page 392 paperback edition.  Fine.  You want to mock the culture from which you take all the benefit?  Go home, then.

0684833395|5.0|Many people complain that this book has no plot, at least not in any intelligible order, except that Yossarian wishes to keep from being killed at any moment by anyone and anything around him.  He's neurotic, and at the same time the saniest one living, because he'd rather die than be killed.  This book is absurd, I think, not for reasons of humor, but because of the subject matter it portrays.  In fact, it may be more reasonable to show war as absurd than to show war as rational.  I found this to be one of the most endearingly fiendish books I've ever read, and more life-like than I originally viewed it as.  It is not about a plot, for life has no central plan (but rather a disorganized bunch of disparate events), but about the characters and people that fill it.  This book is about the idiosyncracy, absurdity, contradiction, and illogic of personalities, or lack thereof.<br />In this paradoxical way, Catch-22 seems to me to be bizarrely one of the more honest depictions of life as we know it.

One of the books I checked out was David Flanagan's &quot;Javascript The Definitive Guide&quot;.<br />I read several chapters from it, and I cought myself enjoying it more than enjoyed my previous similar titles. So I decided to buy the 4th edition of the book, and was not disappointed. So what things does David do differently?

Untill then, the author explains the core syntax of javascript, how javascript interperator works, how it wraps things into two objects: while interperating - Global and Call objects; talks about variable scopes and Garbage collection, objects, arrays, operators and other good stuff. It will tell you the different between object properties and variables ( or does it say there're no differences? ), talks about Regular Expression and nested functions.<br />People who have little or no programming background tend to find this chat quite boring and meaningless ( as I would've couple of years ago ).

B00005OM4N|5.0|Quite frankly, I was a little disappointed in Britney's debut album, '...Baby, One More Time. It was too producer-driven, and relied on her hits to carry it through the market, with nothing but cheap filler comprising the rest of the CD. It was like a package of hits with far too many Styrofoam peanut songs. 'Oops! I Did It Again' was a step away from that, with Britney beginning to add her own ideas to the songwriting process. 'Britney,' Ms. Spears' latest release, proves that she's becoming comfortable in her own talented skin. She can and did write much of her own material for this album, contributing heavily to its lyrics, which are more solid and powerful on this album than on either of her two previous releases combined. If every album has a theme, then this one can be summed up in the title of the disc's fourth track, and Britney's second US single: \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.\\" Its a song written by fellow songstress Dido, and captures (in perhaps too sappy a way) the uncertainty of adolescence Britney and many of her legions of fans experience. Too many people allowed their disdain for \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" keep them from even listening to 'Britney' and subsequently missed out on a great CD. However, \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" is not the entire album. It's just one song, which can be skipped. Utilizing a vocal range she hadn't attempted before, 'Britney' lends more of a hip-hop edge to her typical bubblegum sound. The beats are harder, the music is more uptempo, and her voice sounds better than ever. \\"Anticipating\\" has that 70s roller-rink sound one can't help but bob one's head to, \\"Boys\\" is a perfect girly club anthem, and \\"Cinderella\\" may be her best song to date. It's a superb album in that it is an example of Britney's growth as an artist, and it's just the sort of fresh sound the pop music world so desperately needs.  It's the same danceable Britney, but with a new vibe that every fan is sure to love. It is, however, an adjustment for Spears purists. Just let it grow on you and you won't want to ever turn it off.
B000053V7Q|5.0|Through the wonders of modern technology, and the brilliance of talented editors, the people at Warner Bros. have gone into their vaults and re-worked the footage shot for Elvis' 1970 Vegas concerts, and created a masterpiece.<br />The original THAT'S THE WAY IT IS was bogged down by pointless, boring footage of Elvis fans, and had horrible narrow sound. Now, we lose the extranneous footage, and what we get is more Elvis, the REAL Elvis, with songs and scenes never before seen. Add to this a jaw-dropping 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack, and this is the closest you can get to knowing what seeing Elvis in person AT HIS ZENITH was all about.<br />This is Elvis at his peak. In fine physical condition, perfect vocal shape, and best of all, really having fun with the music he loves so well. All the great songs are here, with an especially devastating and definitive take on YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVIN' FEELIN'.<br />I never cared for Elvis on film, with the exception of VIVA LAS VEGAS and JAILHOUSE ROCK. The old TTWII was boring and felt distant. This new version brings it all home. Brilliantly done. A true cause for celebration by Elvis fans worldwide.

B00000IFWE|2.0|Losing it?  Petty's totally lost it ... at least on this lazy slab of retro-rough drafts.  Since &quot;Full Moon Fever,&quot; Petty's somehow picked up a reputation as a &quot;master songwriter.&quot;  He may have had a way with a hook way back when, but a &quot;master&quot; would certainly take more care with the melodies and show more invention with rock's cliches.  Many of the songs attempt Petty's by now painfully familiar 'folk' feel -- which means they drone on and on without getting any place.  Even the one track he should ace -- the garage-y &quot;Free Girl&quot; -- is more volume than actual hooks.  Comparing this to &quot;Hard Promises&quot; or &quot;Damn the ...&quot; will bring tears to your eyes.
0345357116|4.0|Well once again Tolkien's tales are spellbinding and historic.  A true triumph in story telling.  Unfortunately most of the stories are &quot;Unfinnished&quot; but there is narrative that explains the direction of the stories ending.  if you want to find out as much as there is in the Middle Earth world, than read this book.
0064471837|5.0|This book rules all, except maybe its sequel!  It is a tad confusing at first but everything is explained in due time.  If you don't have this book or haven't read it buy it or read it!  Then read the sequel!  There is only one bad thing about these books, they're to short!  I want more!  I can't wait tell the next book!!!! :)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This was such a wonderful movie.  The type that gives you an unrelenting smile untill you cry.  It was beautifuly done with great cinimatography, score, soundtrack, coreographing, directing and acting.  One of Nichole's braver preformances and Ewan was very charming.  It makes me want to go and learn to sing.  Truely original and fasinating.  Fun for the whole family
B00000JPH5|5.0|This movie became a favorite growing up. My school friends and I would sit around and drool over David Bowie. The characters are hilarious from portly Hoggle to behemouth Ludo. The music is fun and definitely catchy, especially \\"Dance, Magic.\\" You'll find yourself quoting lines over and over again with your family.      Sarah (Jennifer Connelly in her younger years) is on a quest to find her baby brother, whom the Goblin King (Bowie) has kidnapped.  Along the way she encounters many interesting characters who help her with her task.  Like many teenagers, Sarah is very self-involved and the hurdles she comes across during her struggle causes her to grow and change; to become aware that the world doesn't revolve around her; to realize that you can do things on your own but they're alot easier to achieve when you have the help of friends.
0312265859|2.0|This was the worst book Janet Evanovich has written.  The plot was non-existant and the characters were warmed over versions from her earlier books.  The book felt as if it had been written hastily just to get it on the shelf for the summer beach crowd.  You really can do better than this, Janet.
B000066NW0|5.0|The entire Avril Lavigne CD is well-written and the songs have a deep meaning to them.  Avril Lavigne's soulful voice only adds to the message of the songs.  The entire album can't be played from start to finish and the types of music on it are truly varied.  Avril's voice manages to change with each songs.  For example, in &quot;Complicated&quot;, her voice posseses an angsty quality.  However, on such songs as &quot;I'm With You&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot;, she allows her voice to express the feelings of an innocent and lost little girl.  Overall, the album is phenomenal and fans of Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, and John Mayer are likely to enjoy it.
0385720920|5.0|\\"Choke\\" is unlike anything I have ever read before. Chuck Palahniuk creates a vivid look into the life of a con artist/sex addict(weather or not the reader likes him depends on the reader's feelings about the two subject matters that \\"Choke\\" deals with), but every chapter seems like another storie with the same main character in it. The reader jumps from the main character's childhood and back several times. By the time you finish \\"Choke\\" everything sorta falls into its place which is one of the reasons \\"Choke\\" is a very intersting and quick read, but the book is not ment to be a positive one, even though there are some really funny moments in the storie.<BR> <BR>Because of Chuck Palahniuk's choice of words he uses through \\"Choke\\" I would not suggest \\"Choke\\" to the easily offended.
B00005JKL8|5.0|I think &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; is a great war film.  Not only is the action constant - it still manages to make you laugh at the same time.  I honestly truly enjoyed the film and Owen Wilson did an incredible acting job in it.  Gene Hackman does a great job playing the commander with compassion.  The ending of the film is not surprise, but it gives you a little, warm fuzzy feeling inside.  This film is certainly worth watching!
0767805712|5.0|I've read that this movie is considered \\"post-modern fantasy\\" by some. It is not. This film is an allegory based on our own \\"corporate culture.\\" It is also a story in the tradition of Orwell's _1984_. The difference is that a corporate totalitarian state and not a socialist totalitarian state is described. The results are essentially the same, mind-numbing conformity and a tiny elite in control.<br /><br />  When you see the absolute conformity of this society backed by random and ubiquitous genetic testing, you cannot fail to see the direction that our own society is heading. The dictatorship of I.Q. Testing, Personality Testing, Drug Testing, combined with employment records, educational transcripts, social security numbers, green cards, and a national ID card, all essentially equals Gattica (i.e. you are classified and graded as a commodity and are locked into that classification for life.) As the main character finds out, even though he is a better astro-navigator than anyone else, the corporate system will only hire him as a janitor, because he is genetically \\"in-valid.\\" It is also a nice touch that such descrimination is technically against the law, but the corporations in charge ignore those laws....<br /><br />  This is scary stuff- and uncomfortably close to the truth.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Early in Luc Besson's film, \\"Leon\\" (aka The Professional), we learn that only master assassins work up close, with their hands or a knife. If that's true then Besson must consider himself a master director as this movie takes the audience up close and personal with some fascinating but ultimately doomed characters.<br />If it seems the title role was written for Jean Reno, that's only because it was. He plays an Italian hit-man who works in New York. Like many immigrants, he is isolated within the new and unfamiliar world. He shares a squalid little apartment with one plant and leaves only to buy provisions, visit his friend, (and manager), Tony, and occasionally see an old movie at the local cinema. His life would be small and insignificant if it weren't for the fact that he is a ruthless killer, working for the Mob.<br />The genius of this film is that it somehow convinces the audience to feel sympathy towards a brutal assassin. This \\"Professional\\" is portrayed as somehow fragile while at the same time being perfectly dangerous. He can't read English, doesn't speak much and is clearly being short-changed by Tony, a slick Italian \\"Family\\" man played gently by Danny Aiello. When trouble visits Leon's little unit block, he doesn't venture out but prefers to watch from the safety of his door's spy-hole.<br />This particular trouble comes in the form of detective Norman Stansfield, a crooked cop who arrives to visit one of his drug couriers who stupidly gambles his life in an effort to increase his slice of the business. Stansfield, played brilliantly by Gary Oldmam, is a pill-popping psychotic whose only redeeming feature seems to be a love of classical music. Sadly he sees parallels between famous concertos and savage gun battles. In this case, his shotgun version of Beethoven leaves the entire family dead in their apartment; all but 12-year-old Mathilda.<br />Natalie Portman's first major cinematic role, as Mathilda, is impressive. She has to project a broad range for a child character. After growing up as a drug dealer's daughter and then losing even that small security, she is both vulnerable and street smart. And, after convincing Leon to take her in, she also starts to explore her budding sexuality, (a foreshadowing of her role in Beautiful Women).<br />In our politically correct world, 12-year-old girls are not meant to be sexually attractive but that doesn't stop Besson from designing scenes where young Mathilda makes serious attempts to seduce the shy Leon. It's unclear whether she truly feels love or is simply trying to ensure her new place in the world. The result is a strong bond between the two unlikely companions, more familial than sexual. In the end, it is this bond that forces Leon to abandon his years of caution.<br />This is a film that combines a perfect cast with inspired direction, European cinematography and the characteristic score of Eric Serra to create a powerful, sometimes disturbing, experience that will stay with you for years to come.or a child character.

078401213X|4.0|I enjoyed the storyline.  I thought the director did an excellent job of bringing the audience into the tortured world of understanding chaos.  I once read a story of a scientist at Los Almos who tried to change his clock from a 24 hour day to a 26 hour day.  He nearly went crazy. This movie mirrors that story.  I enjoyed the acting, the black and white setting and the storyline.  However, the sound gave me a headache. Maybe I am to share a headache with the main character.  I understand the role sound plays in the movie.  I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish. However, like a child playing the piano, a dog barking all night or fingernails going down a chalkboard; it all still gets on your nerves.  Overall, an excellent movie.
B00005QIPH|3.0|The Strokes have had more hype that they deserve - but setting that aside, they are still an exceptional band.  Their music draws you in and takes you for a spin and then, in the end, that's that.  They offer you a glimpse into their world of urbanized love and dishonesty and something we can all relate to too well - confusion.  The Strokes are worthy of applause, but the build-up they have been given is honestly too much.  If you aren't a fan of their music by the end, put it away.  But I think that most listeners can agree that without the hype, there's more there.  I began listening before I heard about them - after a Reading concert in England - and found their music seductive and attractive.  Julian's voice is thriving with deceit and innocence, an odd combination.  It makes for a good album - everyone should give it a try.
B00005O5JV|5.0|If you love Clueless, you'll LOVE this movie!  All of the characters are not only full of funny dialogue, but their actions and faces are so entertaining.  Reese Witherspoon is perfect as Elle, a fashion major from CULA who aspires to be a Harvard Law student to win back her boyfriend.  On her path to self discovery, she finds new friends and a new best friend, finds a new love, and develops confidence in herself.  This comedy is an inspiration for blondes everywhere!!!
B00002E23E|3.0|Could these guys have taken themselves any more seriously? Along with Emerson, Lake & Palmer and The Moody Blues, I think Zep takes the cake for the 70s hubris crown. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that their music is bad. It's just not as great as Zeppelin thought it was. The Song Remains The Same is really a prototype for the state of modern hard rock music. If you catch any of those ridiculous rock videos on MTV, TSRTS's influence is usually obvious.<br />John Paul Jones (who's by far the most dignified of the bunch) is seen galloping around in some graveyard with a K-Mart Halloween mask on. He then goes to his incredibly nice house and returns to being a normal family man.<br />Robert Plant (who's the most earnest of the bunch) goes off on some knight-in-shining-armour kick complete with fair maiden and castle. Plant has some Welsh flags flying around, but I believe Bobby-boy is English.... Nevertheless, at least we don't have to listen to a violin bow screeching on a guitar for ten minutes through this sequence.<br />John Bonham (who was the most obnoxious of the bunch, if you believe all the stories) is shown racing in a car, walking around with a cow, and beating on a drum. Bonham's video isn't as pretentious as the others', it's just merely boring.<br />Jimmy Page (who's by far the most self-absorbed of the bunch) has a very, very scary sequence that involves some old guy on a hill. It was so scary that I was on the floor laughing about three minutes into it. Personally, I enjoy atonal music, but Jimmy's little violin solo is purely self-indulgent.<br />However, the music redeems TSRTS to a certain extent. No Quarter is truly a haunting piece, as is also Since I've Been Loving You. Rock and Roll is as good as rocker as any, and Moby Dick is the best rock drum solo that I can think of. Stairway is almost capsized by Robert Plant's extracurricular vocals, but it still remains majestic.<br />Not that it's Zeppelin's fault, but Whole Lotta Love, Bring It On Home, and Black Dog sound like every hard rock band of the last thirty years. Hey, I know Zep was the first but a little overexposure goes a long way.Bring It On Home, and Black Dog sound like every hard rock band of the last thirty years.

B00005JKCF|5.0|I love this movie! This movie is about a poor nerd named Peter Parker who doesn't have any friends and he gets stung by this spider and turns into a superhero. He falls in love with a girl next door and they eventually like each other but she does not like Peter she likes Spider-Man. It's a reference to Superman and Batman but I think Spider-Man is a lot better than those movies. Tobey Maguire did his best job and so did Kirsten Dunst. I think Tobey is not a very good actor but he did okay in this movie. I think this movie is the feel good movie of the year and it does deserve a five star rating. Go see it if you like Spider-Man!
0316666343|5.0|Based on hype, bought this book.  It is thought provoking (what is death, what is heaven) disturbing (the evil of the murderer/rapist) touching (the portrate of adolescent love is right on) inventive (the whole notion of a narrator in heaven, who can observe current and past life everywhere on earth is an irresistable twist on the omnipresent narrator).  Most of all the story is very good and interesting, and is told almost entirely without the sort of overwrought prose which too often infects books like this.  In short, amazingly, this book rings true.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|It would be easy to ambush the fluffy \\"triumph of the human spirit\\" theme if not for the exceptional acting, directing, and soundtracks that comprise the film's strongest links. The story of schizophrenic John Nash is highly stylized and, like a linear equation, follows a very straightforward path to reach an expected outcome. The only reason I cared about Nash's arrogant mind was because of Crowe's exceptional acting, Jennifer Connelly's radiance and the chilling soundtrack, which is one of the best I've heard in the last few years. A Beautiful Mind is really the story of two beautiful hearts, and I can't help but believe Connelly came out with the better performance (and why her Oscar contenders didn't have a chance).<br />Despite winning Best Picture for 2002 (and I can say deservedly so), I think this DVD is at best a one-time rental; there are hardly any intracacies that will get noticed in a second viewing. The DVD packs quite a few features, but other than the two commentary tracks, nothing seems to warrant investing for this pricier 2-disc set.
B000002KBU|5.0|&quot;Blue&quot; is a classic album.  An intimate collection of superbly crafted gems like &quot;All I Want&quot;, &quot;Little Green&quot;, and &quot;River&quot;, it is a definite must for Joni Mitchell fans, or anyone who wants to experience pure, euphoric music the way God must have intended it.  Joni Mitchell is a national treasure and &quot;Blue&quot; is her masterpiece.
B00003CXI1|5.0|When I first picked up the book \\"Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone\\" in 8th grade, I wanted to see what all the hub-bub was about. I had heard that it was \\"great\\" and \\"excellent,\\" and I wasn't dissapointed. Then, when I heard that a movie was being made out of the bestseller, I hopped right on the fan train and waited anxiously. When I finally saw the movie for the first time, I was blown away by how good it was. <br />Daniel Raddcliffe plays the young wizard Harry Potter, who, due to the death of his parents, has to stay to live with his unbarable aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon and not to mention their freakishly overwieght son Dudley. While on a trip to the zoo on Dudley's birthday, Harry makes a pane of glass dissapear and subsuqently Dudley falls right in. <br />Later on that week, mail starts coming; not just any mail though, the owl post. Letters adressed to \\"Mr. H Potter Cupboard Under The Stairs\\" start arriving on a frequent basis, until Vernon gets so uspet that he takes the family onto an island shack. <br />While there, at the strok of midnight on Harry's birthday, a great large bangs rash the door of the shack until it falls down and in comes Reubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys and games at Hogwarts. Hogwarts, to those who haven't read any of the books or been under a rock for the last 5 years is \\"the greatest school of wizardry and witchcraft and is headed by the finest headmaster...Albus Dumbledore.\\"  So, \\"reluctantly\\" Vernon lets Harry go to Hogwarts. <br />Harry doesn't know, though, that he has to get rather odd supplies for school, like a cauldron and a wand. Hadgrid brings him to a bar called the Leaky Cauldron, where everybody inside knows who mister Potter is, which makes him very uncomfortable. Outside though, Harry gets his first glimpse at the wizard shopping mall persay, Diagon Alley. While there, he gets all of his supplies for his first year. <br />Even though he has a time trying to get on to Platfrom 9 3/4 (yes 9 3/4) at Kings Cross Station,he meets who will soon become his best friends: Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint). He also meets his arch-ememy Draco Malfoy. <br />The staff of Hogwarts reads like a whos who of English actors: Richard Harris (Unforgiven) as the wise old Albus Dumbledore, Alan Rickman (Die Hard) plays vindictive Professer Snape, Maggie Smith (Gosford Park) plays the by the book Professer McGonnegal and Robbie Coltrane plays the forementioned Reubeus Hagrid. <br />The highlight of the movie is the Qudditch game. Qudditch is like the wizard hybrid of basketball and soccer, only it has three types of balls and is played on broomsticks. <br />All and all this movie is great fun to watch, and the special features are excellent, expecially the deleated sense. One of them has the funny voiced Seamus Finnigan talking, which gave me quit the chuckle.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|It's disappointing movie with a silly story. Most of the movie based on the 3rd series of the Tomb Raider video game, which is the worst in the Tomb Raider video game series.<br />If you really like Tomb Raider video game, do not watch the movie because you will hate the video game and you will not play any Tomb Raider video games ever after. <br />Well, if you still want to buy this movie rent it first and you will see.
B00005YXZH|4.0|A band experiments within the rock/pop genre and should sell a lot of product if there was any justice.  Instead, faced with relative obscurity, there is a line-up shake-up and the group's leader goes on to create what is by far the band's best material, only to see the record company put it on the shelf for a couple of years.    That was the story of Big Star's fantastic &quot;Sister/Lovers&quot;, which the current Wilco CD resembles in no small way.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is probably the best rock album out there right now and worth repeated listening.  But if you like this, do yourself a favor and check out Alex Chilton's original masterpiece(s).
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Once in a while, a movie will come along that stays with you long after you watch it.  It'll take you and send you through a thrilling emotional roller coaster ride.  You become deeply attached with the characters and care about them as if they were your own family, and you remain highly anticipated of what's next all the way through.  Moulin Rouge, starring the elegant and graceful Nicole Kidman along with the fresh and vibrant Ewan McGregor, highly impacted me in so many positive and surprising ways.  From the trailers, this movie didn't strike me as anything worthwhile, but after renting the DVD, I loved it and decided to purchase it immediately.  It was indeed one of the best purchases for a DVD that I have ever made.  I was satisfied and beyond in so many ways.<br />The story is quite simple.  Satine, played by Nicole Kidman, is a courtesan at the Moulin Rouge.  She's an entertainer and an aspiring actress.  Through a fortunate incident, she meets Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, who is an apsiring writer.  These two immediately recognize and can't deny their feelings for one another, but things become complicated.  Satine realizes that she can't allow herself to fall in love because it could deeply affect her work.  Despite this, Christian manages to convince her that their love can overcome any of life's barriers.  Christian's powerful quote, &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return,&quot; basically sums up the whole concept of the movie.  Moulin Rouge tells a story of two doomed and star-crossed lovers who find their way to one another and showcases their trials and tribulations surrounding their forbidden love.  Another interesting fact about this film, is that the story is told amazingly through song.<br />The DVD is one of the best releases of all time, in my honest opinion.  The first disc includes the feature film, along with commentary and a few other goodies.  The second disc, however, contains most of the juicy extras.  There are music videos, behind the scenes featurettes, trailers, multimedia galleries, etc.  There are hours of enteratining extras on this DVD.  It informs you of the long process of making this movie, and how everything came into its right place to produce one of the best movies of all time.  If you haven't seen Moulin Rouge, I strongly request that you do so now, and if you have seen it but don't yet own the DVD, you're missing out on a fantastic treat.
0446608955|5.0|This book is one my favorite books that I have read. After seeing the movie starring Mandy Moore and Shane West I begged my mother to take me to purchase the book. This is must for any book fan who doesn't mind a tear-jerking story. I slightly wish I had discovered the book before the movie, because I found my self skimming it at parts because of my knowledge of the movie. I recommend reading the book before seeing it. Other than that, I loved this book and finished it in 2 days. Read this book!
6305609721|5.0|This is probably best star trek movie in existence.  This movie is witty, funny and socially conscious all at the same time.  It also several memorable situations the best of which include Kirk trying to explain that they don't use money in the 24th century, Spock smoking a little to much LDS back in the 60s just to name a few.  It offers a wonderful snapshot of America in the 80s.  If you have to see a star trek movie this is the one you would want to see.   It is also, in a way, Star Treks own nod towards the conservation movement.  Who knows one day up the road an alien probe may show up asking to talk to Wales <br />Star Trek 6
B00005JKNF|1.0|What a waste of acting talent.  Anyone who enjoys a good mystery will be sorely disappointed here.  Easily figured out soon after the murder takes place, this script is an abomination.  The speech was practically unidentifiable as the English lanaguage when spoken by the household staff.  The banter of the guests was understandable but incredibly stultifying.  The only positive was the early 1930's setting.  The directing was simply annoying.  Don't waste your time  or money (as I did) on this easily forgotten, overhyped, completely non-entertaining waste of talent and film.
B00003CY0U|4.0|It has been said that you can't judge a book by it's cover.  I say you can't judge a movie by it's name.  This movie has been out awhile, but the name did not intrique me...so I did not rush to see it.  Upon learning that it starred John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Don Cheadle...I figured it was worth watching.<br />This high-tech thriller kept me in suspense the entire time.  Jackman is a top notch computer hacker, Berry's character is very mysterious, Cheadle is law enforcement and Travolta is the mastermind behind stealing millions from a government slush fund named Swordfish.  If you want suspense and excitement, then this is for you.
0800177363|5.0|Based on the real life story of Dr. Oliver Sacks, 'Awakenings' ranks as one of the best movies I've seen.  If features a terrific screenplay that was adapted from the book and a memorable directing job by Penny Marshall.  But the most suprising thing to me was the choice of actors to play the two main roles in the movie.  Robin Williams was pretty much known as the slightly insane comic genius from the 1980's, and Robert DeNiro was playing such hard-hitting, aggressive characters in films like 'Raging Bull', 'The Untouchables', 'Taxi Driver', and 'The Deer Hunter'.  Both actors turn in career performances, and play parts that totally will smash any preconceived notions you had of them up to that point.<br />The film is based on Dr. Leo Sayer(Williams) and his work with people who have come down with a mysterious sleeping-sickness in 1918, which has left them in a catatonic state.  Dr. Sayer is a shy person who is not comfortable conversing with others, but is also a very dedicated neurologist.  He starts to work with these \\"sleeping\\" people and thinks that he senses something in them that is alive deep inside.  He begins to work with a man called Leonard Lowe(DeNiro), and takes a special interest in him.  He reads up on the drug L-Dopa, which had helped people in similiar states as his patients, and tries to convince the hospital and Leonard's mother to try the drug on her son.  They allow the test to happen, and Leonard wakes up from his \\"sleep\\".  The drug is then tried on his other patients with similar results.  You would think that it was a happy story from thereafter, but life is not full of Hollywood endings, and the story does not take the easy way out.  It won't leave you depressed or exhilarated but somewhere in between, like life is most of the time.<br />Definitely one of the best films to come out in the past 12 years, and should be in any serious movie buff's collection.  There are no extra's on the DVD, but the quality of the picture is pretty good.  But in the end, isn't it about the movie, not the extra's(by the way, I love the extra's just as much as everyone else).  Marshall, Williams, and DeNiro have made a special film that they should be proud of and will be watched by generations to come.
1577311523|5.0|I have refrained from writing a review of this book for nearly a year and a half, being content to simply practice what Tolle has expressed so simply - remain in the present moment for that is all we have.  After nearly three decades of practicing meditation to become enlightened (some day) I found it disheartening to conclude that I wasn't really getting anywhere, yet I was reluctant to give up the effort.  Then Tolle popped into my life like a much needed life preserver, showed me who I really am, and put an end to my thrashing about in self-created whirlpools of despair - when you discover you are the ocean itself the whirlpools peter out in embarrassment.    Don't read this book in order to feed your mind, stroke your ego or validate your beliefs.  Read it in order to learn to free yourself from pain and delusion.  It is obvious when reading certain reviews that some people are looking to add mind stuff to their inventory and then to demonstrate what a fine mind they have with an erudite and academic rebuff. They will have to remain content with a mind dominated life, always looking for something outside themselves to give validation and meaning.  At some point, however, if they are lucky they may tire of that and take the opportunity to practice living in the now.  It takes courage to jump into the unknown and discover the freedom and joy in living life moment to moment.    Perhaps you are ripe for this book like I was.  Even so it was not always easy to let go of cherished beliefs and practices, but ultimately it is the only thing you can do if you really want freedom.  Tolle shows how conditioned we have become in a gentle and easy manner, leading you by the hand all the way to the door of freedom.  But it is up to each one of us to open that door.  At first you may spend only moments of clock time in the sweetness of the now.  If you keep at it you will become more skillful in accessing the now, and you will find yourself dwelling there for extended periodsof clock time. And then upon reflection you will realize the peace that is always available - that we ARE peace.    So, are you willing to see what life will be like without a mind and ego to steer your every move, as you have been so conditioned to do all your life? (and if you are, don't worry, you will always have access to the mind and ego). Are you willing to let go of everything and to simply BE and let life unfold naturally? (it will anyway, but not resisting it reveals the peace that underlies all phenomena).  If you are you will not find a better guide than Eckhart Tolle.
0684803356|4.0|This novel is considered by most to be one of the great novels of the 20th Century, and its author to be one of the greatest authors of all time; there are undoubtedly reasons for this. Yet, Hemmingway is also considered to be a &quot;love him&quot; or &quot;hate him&quot; type. I tend toward the former, though he isn't one of my personal favorites.<br />The plot of this novel is relatively straightforward. American Robert Jordan, a member of the International Brigades fighting with the Republicans against the Fascists during the Spanish Civil War, is given the task of blowing up a bridge to prevent the Fascists from bringing up reinforcements to repel a Republican offensive. But while the plot is uncomplicated, the depth and breadth of Hemmingway's story telling are not. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. The characters are so incredibly real, that you feel as though you could find their names in a history book. For those who have never read Hemmingway, I'd say give it a try.
6300215814|5.0|Breakfast... is definitely one of the best (and my personal favorite) pieces of cinema ever made. It puts out enough romance without turning saccharine, and has plenty of scandal, intrigue, and humor. It also has one of the best theme songs in history: Mancini's &quot;Moon River&quot;. Grab yourself a breakfast pastry and a tennis bracelet, and buy this movie!
0786867973|1.0|...---British measurements are different from American, etc.<br />THAT explains why the Norwegian Cinnamon Buns are so far off!!  I have made cinnamon buns for years, but thought I would try this new version---first of all, the directions say nothing of dissolving the yeast in warm water, and secondly, the proportion of the flour to the liquid is not correct.  I have the buns in the refrigerator for the second rising in the morning & am anxious to see how the final product fares, after adding several more cups of flour to get the dough to a reasonable ball shape.<br />So far, I am not impressed at all, and find the ...price high for recipes that are not accurate.  Good thing it was a gift--I would not have bought it at all.
1881273156|5.0|My wife's love language is physical touch. I can tell her \\"I love you\\" a thousand times and not have the impact of simply holding her hand, snuggling together on the couch, touching her face or brushing her hair.<br />Finally, I found how to \\"speak\\" to her in a language we both understand. This book has made our relationship stronger and saved both of us the frustration of \\"speaking\\" in a foreign love language.
B00006690G|5.0|This is one album I never thought I would buy.  Leave aside the fact that most of my favorite music is country or 80's rock, or the fact that I'm not a member of the MTV generation at 26, I'm also a fairly conservative, professional, mother and wife.  Not exactly the target audience, I'm sure.  However, I have really enjoyed the music on this album.  Although \\"Without Me\\" remains my favorite, there are some very good songs of the CD, in a variety of formats, and the use of language is not only entertaining and 'in your face,' it's downright amazing.  The fact that anyone could include \\"Munchhausen Syndrome\\" in a rap, rhymed and smooth, is impressive in it's own right.  Definitely worth listening to, even if you're not into this particular genre.
B000067J1I|1.0|The original DVD release of \\"Big\\" was rather disappointing. No extras, non-anamorphic video, and a weak 2.0 Dolby Surround track. Certainly this 1988 gem of a film (which, in my opinion, is Tom Hanks' best live-action work to date) deserves better treatment. With all the films that Fox has given wonderful DVD treatment to, such as Die Hard, M*A*S*H, and Speed, I'm certain they could do a wonderful Special Edition DVD for \\"Big\\".  But instead, we get a Full Screen rehash of the lame original disc, which has been out now for three years. This puts the new DVD edition a notch further below the subpar initial widescreen disc. Please, Fox, give \\"Big\\" the Special Edition DVD it deserves! I'm talking audio commentary with Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Perkins, and Penny Marshall; cast & crew bios; original trailer and TV ads; anamorphic widescreen and DD 5.1; the AMC \\"Backstory\\" special; the \\"Big\\" segment from the 2002 AFI Lifetime Achievement Award Tom Hanks special; deleted scenes & outtakes; a documentary; production notes. That would be the ideal DVD release for this classic movie. Make it a 2-disc Five Star Collection if you must, but please devote your energies to giving this film the DVD treatment it deserves, which is not a Full Screen, barebones disc.
B000000WF0|5.0|This CD will turn into the soundtrack of your life. From the reverberating strings of &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; to the positive vibe of &quot;Lucky man&quot;. This cd is full of gorgeous heartfelt music that can evoke the most profound joy and sadness. Although many people overlooked this album as another one hit-wonder parade, to me is so rich in emotions and it's musically crafted with overwhelming beauty that makes the cd stand out from the deep sea of alternative rock. My favorite song on the cd is &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; because it makes me fill my mind with beautiful imagery of forests, lakes and rivers. It makes me escape the loneliness for a powerful couple of minutes.
0312265859|5.0|I have to admit, I was wondering how well Janet Evanovich was going to be able to continue her hysterically funny Stephanie Plum mystery series. (Every time I read a Stephanie Plum novel, I laugh myself silly.) After all, many writers have lost their originality by their eighth book in a series, cranking them out like an assembly line.<br />My fears were completely unfounded. Evanovich is as funny as ever, and bounty hunter Stephanie's just as inept - and as likable - as ever. (Her unfortunate run-in at the park with a flock of geese is one of my new favorite scenes.) In Hard Eight, the tone gets a little darker than her previous books, but the wild action and the humor seem to have been ratcheted up a notch to compensate. My only gripe is with the character of Morelli. He seems to want a typical Jersey housewife, so why is he always making a play for Steph? (As frustrating as this is, though, it's also realistic, from what I've seen.) I fervently hope that Stephanie takes up fellow bounty hunter Ranger on his offer to make her forget Morelli in book nine.<br />All I can say is, I'm avidly looking forward to the next book. A year seems too long to wait...
B000003TSP|5.0|Jeff Bateman's a [fool].  This album is Portishead's best work.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series. I've read all the books, looking forward to #5. I was hoping the movie of Sorceror's Stone would be good, but sadly, it wasn't. It had its good points, but overall it was disappointing. I don't say that just because it wasn't as good as the book, or because it came out at the same time as a truly great movie adaptation of a similar book (The Fellowship of the Ring), but because it had serious flaws.<br />First, the good stuff: This movie looked great. Nice cinematography and art direction. Hogwarts and Diagon Alley were perfect. A few of the special effects were good - Fluffy the dog, the chess board, the flying in Quiditich. There were a few - too few - quiet moments that really resonated: Harry sitting and staring at the Mirror of Erised, the huge flock of owls outside the Dursley house. Daniel Radcliffe got the right mix of heroism and ordinariness for Harry, the actors playing Snape, Hagrid + McGonnagall were spot on. A few actors with minor roles (Malfoy, Filch, Wood, Olivander) hammed it up admirably.<br />That being said, there were big things wrong. The kid who played Ron had one befuddled expression that he flashed in every scene. Richard Harris was as wooden as a broomstick as Dumbledore. A few effects, like the invisibility cloak, were clumsy. But that's minor stuff. The biggest problem is that the movie was poorly plotted and poorly adapted from the book.<br />It feels like they selected random scenes and dialogue and filmed them, not like they were trying to tell an actual story. Examples:<br />Haul out your copy of Book 1 and reread the chapter on the train. In one chapter, Rowling firmly establishes that Harry and Ron have gone from strangers to best buddies, Hermione's irksome bossiness, and Neville's patheticness. Nothing even remotely like that happens in the movie. For all the times they mention Bernie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, you'd think it was a real product that was paying for onscreen product placement.I could have done with less about the beans, more about character development.<br />When Quirrell takes off the turban, that should be the big climax, but the movie has done next to nothing to demonstrate that Voldemort is the big bad guy, everyone fears him etc. No one trembles when Harry speaks the name aloud. No mention of why Snape hates Harry, making him seem like a clumsy red herring in the movie (instead of, arguably, the most complex character in the books). Neville coming through at the end has no impact, because the movie hasn't established what a hard-luck case he is.<br />I could go on, but basically, all too much about the movie would make no sense and have no impact if you hadn't read the book.<br />It also doesn't help that the navigation of many features on the DVD is set up like a clumsy video game.<br />Here's hoping the more plot-driven Chamber of Secrets makes for a better film #2.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|Opera performance involves many people. It is an extremely rare event when each of these people is in the right place at the right time. Furtwaengler's \\"Don Giovanni\\", recorded in Salzburg, offers more than that: the lost art of making real music without being vulgar or pedantic, the triumph of taste and experience over modernist pseudointellectuals, the ease of accomplished virtuosity, the impeccable quality of singing, compared to which any Metropolitan opera performance recorded during the last 30 years sounds like an amateurs' rehearsal, compared to which Parteigenosse von Karajan simply fades out of memory like the bloodless, lifeless ghost, inflated to the extent of invisibility. I am not afraid to use the strongest expressions: this is, probably, the best opera performance ever recorded, and it shall stand forever as one of the highest human achievements, putting to shame and tormenting every envious follower of the ephemeral fads and perversions. I am very glad that this recording has been issued on DVD, which substantially improves the quality of sound and image. This DVD is also reasonably priced. Previously, I've cherished a very expensive ($80) and rare VHS tape, somewhat blurry in both sound and image. Now I am given a bliss of seeing it again in sharp and bright colors on wide screen, as if I've been sitting right there, in the orchestra pit, beside good old scary Furtwaengler, breathing the fresh evening air of that miraculous night in Salzburg, watching Don Giovanni, that archetype of modern irresponsibility, being consumed by the flames of confusion and pain he caused to others. Curiously enough, when I was very young, Don Giovanni seemed to me a hero rejecting prejudice and irrationality; the older I became, the uglier stood this freak who flouts prejudice only because he is full of it, because he has challenged the mediocrity not from above but from below. Self-destruction never comes uninvited: \\"M'invitasti, e son venuto.\\"

0345350499|5.0|Everyone has heard the legends of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table.  The Mists of Avalon takes those legends and does what none of them do - tell the stories from the views of the women surrounding Arthur.<br />Bradley takes each of her characters and makes them throughly human while changing some of the well known ideas about the Arthurian legend.  Morgaine, his half sister, is no evil sorceress, but a devoted priestess fighting to save a dying religion.  Gwynhefar is torn between the love she has for her king and her love for the knight Lancelet, but at the same time pushes Arthur away from his true religion and into the foolish Christian priests' way of thinking.  She is close-minded and weak, and I mostly saw her as an unlikeable character.  But in the end, the reader fully understands why she acted the way she did.<br />There is so much to be said about the Mists of Avalon.  It is a story of love, duty, and religion.  Bradley paints a vast canvas on which her characters truly live.  Almost every legend of Arthur is explained - the search for the Holy Grail, the birth of Mordred, Arthur and Morgaine's son, Pellinore's dragon, and many more.<br />Read this book for the story, but also read it for its strong messages about love, religion, and purpose.  It's a truly wonderful book.
B0000640VN|4.0|Hugh Jackman is Leopold, the 3rd Duke of Albany, who has come to America in 1876 in search of a rich wife.  Leopold was born a Duke but never felt like one, always preferring to work on his inventions instead.  He is encouraged (by his uncle) to marry a rich woman in order to pay off the royal family's many debts.  Leopold notices a man acting strangely at a dance (where he will announce his plans to marry) and follows him to a bridge being built, the Brooklyn Bridge.  Thinking the man is going to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge, Leopold grabs his arm and is pulled over with the stranger.  They are pulled into a time portal.  The stranger turns out to be Stuart Besser, Leopold's great-great-grandson.  Stuart has figured out a way to travel through time and has come to 1876 to meet his ancestor.  Leopold awakes in present day Brooklyn in Stuart's apartment.  Stuart tries to explain that they are now in 2001 and that Leopold will have to wait one week before Stuart can return him to his own time.  Stuart gets hurt in an elevator accident and ends up in the hospital leaving Leopold to get acquainted with modern day New York and inventions on his own.<br />Living just below Stuart's apartment is Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), a modern day career woman who works in market research.  Kate and Stuart used to date but things didn't work out and now are just neighbors and friends.  Kate and Leopold meet but when Leopold tells her that he is from 1876, Kate thinks he is just another nut and dismisses him as such.  Charlie, Kate's brother, arrives for a visit and becomes friends with Leopold, whom he thinks is a fellow actor.  Charlie realizes Leopold is in love with his sister and sets about getting the two together.<br />Stuart has to return Leopold to 1876 or Stuart will cease to exist.  Also, because Leopold invented the elevator, they also will cease to function properly (which happens in the movie).  Leopold has fallen in love with Kate but realizes that their romance can never be as he knows he must go back to his own time.  Stuart returns a reluctant Leopold to 1876 just as Kate has discovered that he really was from that time and that she is in love with him.  Stuart informs Charlie of the truth and the two men set about getting the two lovers together, back in 1876.  Leopold is announcing his engagement to a rich woman back in his own time when Kate makes the attempt to travel to his side.<br />A romantic comedy with a touch of fantasy.  Meg Ryan is at her best in romantic comedies and being paired with Hugh Jackman makes this movie even better.  I own a number of Meg Ryan movies and have never been disappointed in any of them, but I am particularly fond of this one.  I am fond of this movie because of Hugh Jackman.  He is the real star here and were it not for him, this movie would not have been as good as it is.  He really brings his character to life and you will find yourself (if you're female) wishing that time travel existed so you could meet your own duke!  I look forward to seeing more of Mr. Jackman in future releases.
0385503954|5.0|I picked up this book right after moving to London last fall. It had received lots of media coverage, and it was nominated for the Booker prize (now we know that it didn't win..) I have read most of McEwan's books, and truly loves his writing. \\"Atonement\\", together with \\"Comfort of Strangers\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are the books that I have liked the best.<br />\\"Atonement\\" is one story told through three (almost) \\"separate\\" novellas. First part takes us to England in the 1930'ies. We meet the Tallis family. They live on a beautiful estate, with servants and you name it. The protagonist, is the 13-year-old daughter of the family, Briony Tallis. She is quite theatrical (which kid of 13 doesn't? My 12-year-old daughter certainly competes well against Briony!) and wants to be a writer. She is daily writing on her master play, and she is planning to set up a play that summer, using the whole family as the actors.<br />But something happens that summer, and with a child's mind and perception, she is unable to control the situation. I am not sure if Briony lied, or if she told the truth, truth the way she perceived it. Nevertheless, without realizing, her fantasy and imaginary world soon ruin the world of two of her loved ones, her sister Cecilia and the son of the housekeeper, Robbie. After that, things can never go back to what it was. No matter how much she would later give up in life as her personal atonement, things would, and could, never be the same again.<br />The second part of \\"Atonement\\" jumps to the 1940'ies, and it gets us through the WWII in England and France, and the third part brings us to present, and we end up in 1999 for a rendez-vous on the Tallis estate.<br />McEwan is a true master of writing. All characters are (as usual) very well developed. I like Briony, but I also have a soft spot for her slightly eccentric mom, and the son of the housekeeper, Robbie Turner. The themes in \\"Atonement\\" are well known - love and peace, loyalty vs. obligation, innocence vs. guilt, reality vs. imagination. A less clever writer might have lost the reader's attention, but gifted as he is, McEwan pulls this together masterly!<br />This is a true page-turner. Highly recommended!vs. guilt, reality vs. imagination.

B00003CXI1|3.0|No movie in 2001 was marketed so aggressively as &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (or 'Philosopher's' if you live in the UK) Stone.&quot;  The hype machine at Warners worked overtime to ensure that this film would be a box office hit, and their efforts worked.  I just happen to be one of the twelve people in the USA who hasn't seen this fable, and I finally decided to give it a try.  The premise and story are both interesting: Daniel Radcliffe is impressive as Harry Potter, a 11-year-old kid who is raised by his cruel relatives before he is shipped to school to become a wizard and befriends a couple of classmates who help him during a series of adventures.  At 2.5 hours, the movie passed along nicely, but ultimately suffered from an overall blandness that sank the movie.  I fault director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves, who apparently followed the book so closely so as not to include any surprises or any degree of spontaneity.  On a technical level, I wasn't all that blown away.  The scenes where the kids fly on the broomsticks were kind of blah, although the scenes with that three headed dog were impressive, if slightly reminiscent of &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;  All in all, I was slightly entertained but also disappointed.  A film of this magnitude is supposed to give the casual viewer a reason why the Harry Potter novels are such a staple in pop culture.  As it is, this film is a serviceable kiddie flick that may please its built-in audience but will be hard-pressed to entice those who aren't all familiar with the novels.
0525946284|3.0|Ken Follett, once again, finely blends history with fiction, in his latest WWII thriller, a story of 6 female undercover agents ( although one isn't all what she appears to be ) who attempt to crush the Nazi communication network in Europe literally days, and even hours, prior to D-Day.  \\"Jacdaws\\" is based upon the true story of Pearl Witherington, who was one of the 50 female spies used in the second world war.  Her fictional counterpart is Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clariet, who works with the French underground.<br />The first half of the book is really two stories told simultaneously.  The first is the story of how Flick recruits and trains her team to go into Nazi occupied France to destroy a chateau serving as the center of all German communciations after a failed mission, which opens the story, was unsuccessful in doing so.  The second story of the first half involves Dieter Franck, interrogator and torturer par excellence and how he plans to break the back of the Resistance.  The sections with Flick and the recruitment of her team are somewhat shallow.  Her recruits are somewhat unbelievable at first. When they are finally inducted into the armed services, Flick says to them ( and I swear this is the line from the book ) \\"You're in the army. Now drink your cocoa and go to bed.\\"  Dieter Franck comes across as much more of a deeper character.  An aide to Rommel of Desert Fox fame, he is drawn very well by Follet and, as a result, it appears a tad unbelievable that he would be outwitted by conicidence and blind luck when tracking Flick.  In the second half, when the two stories merge, the action and plot flows much better.<br />Still, Follett lets the gals be the heroes, as he should.  Paul Chancellor and the boys from SOE and MI6 are all secondary. I'm not giving anything away by saying that the Normandy Invasion comes off without a hitch and it's no secret that we win WWII.  Though \\"Jacdaws\\" is not as riveting as \\"Eye of the Needle\\" nor as in depth as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", it is a good beach read.  Also, a  movie starring, maybe, Angelina Jolie, is certainly sure to follow.
B000000OF6|5.0|The 1991 death of Freddie Mercury and the inclusion of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" in the film \\"Wayne's World\\" ignited a renewed interest in Queen.  Known for their over-the-top arrangements and Mercury's undeniable stage presence, Queen was one of the most popular international acts ever.  \\"Queen Greatest Hits 1&2\\" is the definitive collection of the group's material.  These guys dabbled with rock (\\"We Will Rock You\\"), pretentious pop (\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"), Chic-inspired r&b (\\"Another One Bites the Dust\\"), compelling, sap-free love songs (\\"You're My Best Friend\\"), rockabilly (\\"Crazy Little Things Called Love\\"), and even synth pop (\\"Radio Ga Ga\\").  Few groups could claim a body of work so varied as Queen, and all the hits are compiled on these two discs.  Other favorites of mine are \\"I Want to Break Free,\\" the soaring, tear-jerking \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" which had to be written as a hint of Mercury's eventual passing.  My only gripe is that this set excludes the synth-heavy \\"Body Language,\\" which I personally liked.  Queen isn't one of my all-time favorite groups, but only a fool would deny their indelible mark on pop music.
B000031XCR|5.0|90's music will be remembered by excellent female vocalists such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. Celine is a versatile Canadian singer who can sing Broadway musical styled Beauty and Beast rock songs such as All By Myself (Eric Carmen cover) and It's All Coming Back To Me Now (my #1 favorite Celine song) and groovy Because You Loved Me. Personally I would like to hear more of rocky-edged songs but her dynamic vocal appeal is irresistible. Unlike any other compilations this has seven newer tracks including That's The Way It Is featured as single. This latter part of this compilation is somewhat similar in softer tone with latest A New Day Has Come. I am really glad that she came back and will enchant us for sure during this decade as well.
B00004TRD8|5.0|After the moderate success of The Terminator, James Cameron decided to outdo himself with the old \\"bigger is better\\" modus operandi, and together with the greatest special effects maestros in Hollywood, created one of the most amazing sci fi action thrillers ever! This time around, Schwarzenegger was to be the good guy and fans were less than happy with the idea. The Austrian oak who immortilised himself as the unstoppable killing machine who spoke the famous line: \\"I'll be back!\\" But movie geeks had little reason to worry, for Cameron had something better up his sleeve, with the T1000, an even more invincible killing machine who could take on Arnie's T100. The tantilising premise and top-notch talent behind the collosal project ensured boffo box office. And once again, Arnie (with shades for added coolness) proved that when it comes to blowing up things with really big guns, there is no substitute.<br />The action set-pieces are some of the most incredible ever put together, and with Stan Winston's lethal creation and ILM's morphing liguid metal guy (a menacing Patrick Stewart) battling it out for the future of mankind, the stakes are high, and the action ante even higher. A seriously buffed-up Linda Hamilton is a much stronger character than in the first film, and her hard-edged persona is well-played and fits the film's \\"come and get it!\\" tone. While the original's tense structure and nerve-shredding pace makes it superior in terms of cracking action, but in terms of spectacle and jaw-dropping SFX, T2 wins hands down. Wether this of the seminal original is the best is debatable, but what is for sure is that it is truly one awesome thrill ride packed with out-of-this world effects that still amaze 11 years later. Will the upcoming Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines be better? Only time will tell, but rest assured, T2 takes it deserved place in the collection of all-time greats and is a must-have on DVD.<br />The extras are really awesome, with a commentary by 26 Members of cast and crew, commentary by director James Cameron, Commentary by Arnold Schwarzenegger, trailers, the 1.85 Widescreen Theatrical Version, or you can choose the 1.85 Widescreen Special Edition Version. Also, there's over 6 hours of content, \\"The Making of T2\\" Featurette, \\"T2: More Than Meets the Eye\\" Featurette, \\"The Making of T2: 3-D: Breaking the Screen Barrier\\" and Supplemental Material - additional features which cover every aspect of the Terminator 2: Judgment Day film making process. Plus a nice 32 page collector's booklet.
B000001FA4|5.0|In 1984, on the heels of their success with \\"War,\\" U2 release the ambitious \\"The Unforgettable Fire.\\"  While critics didn't exactly trash the album, the consensus was that it lacked the brilliance and focus of its predecessor.  But give it a closer look, and you will find that it contains some of their most underapprected work.  Yes, there are the hits \\"War\\" and the title track, but other tracks of note on this moody album are \\"Bad,\\" the Edge's killer guitar on \\"Wire,\\" and the beautiful \\"A Sort of Homecoming.\\"  Only once does their reach exceed their grasp, as evidenced on the somewhat clumsily-arranged \\"Elvis Presley and America.\\"  Still, I'd rather have a great band like U2 take bold chances and stumble, rather than have an artist play by the rules and take a safer route.  The mainstream audience may hold dear the classics \\"Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Actung Baby,\\" but I still stand by this release.  It's not their best, but it's certainly among my favorites.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch never ceases to amaze me. The man is a genius! This is a director who over the span of his 25 year career has taken what is considered to be the \\"acceptable\\" film narrative and flipped it up side down. He has an ability to tell stories without using convetional story devices, blending mystery and fantastic dream-like sequences. This is shown no better than in Mulholland Drive. This masterpiece of the surreal is Lynch at his best. (Note: I will not give a detailed description of the plot, so as not to give anything away.)<br />Of course, there are many mainstream moviegoers, who I label as \\"cinematic idiots\\", who beg to differ with me. They view this film as a narrative disaster, there are sub-plots that go unexplained, there are people who are introduced in a scene as major characters but then never reappear(Robert Forster's cop, the two men in the diner, etc.), and the movie takes a bizarre twist in the last half hour that seems to negate the two hours that came before it.<br />To all the morons who say this movie is pointless, I will clearly illustrate the point: all the weird stuff aside, the film's story is about a young woman's dream of Hollywood that is shattered by an un-fairy tale like reality. There! Was that so hard? After reading this review, all you nay-sayers, go watch the film again, and try to look at it from that angle.<br />Also, another personal note, I feel that Lynch was robbed of a Best Director Oscar for this film. I mean, come on, \\"A Beautiful Mind?\\" Yeah, it was a good movie and all, but any moron with a camera could have directed that. I challenge anyone to name one director other than Lynch who could have made this movie. Can you think of one? No, didn't think so.<br />All the personal gripes aside, Mulholland Drive has rightfully been praised by SMART MOVIEGOERS as one of the best movies of 2001. This is a must see for any Lynch fan, and for those of you who are not Lynch fans, rent it with an open mind, and maybe you will be turned into a Lynch fan yet. In fact, my advice would be to watch it on a double-bill with Lynch's way underrated Lost Highway, as the two films have very simular structures. Anyway, that's my two cents, so log-off your computer and watch this mind blowing work of art right away!
0312265859|5.0|This is the funniest book of the series--also possibly the most violent. As usual, the plot twists and the outrageous characters kept me from putting this one down!
0807282375|5.0|Wow!  This is one of my all-time favorite books!  The Amber Spyglass is so gripping - it will keep even reluctant readers hooked.  Even though it's a fantasy, the characters' feelings are so real.  The emotions in this book are very touchy - when there's sorrow, you might cry, when there's joy, you might laugh along.  There's also betrayal, innocence, and love.  I think it's a deep exploration of the human nature in a metaphored alien form.<BR>The plot of this book is just fascinating.  There's suspense at every turn.  The complexity of the plot is just another hook to keep readers satisfied, yet the information is never overwhelming to understand.  Lyra and Will are true heros, and together, they defeated the evilness in the world and brought Dust.  They are both passionate children who dare to explore the unknown.  They have endless courage and bravery, thus giving them their titles as heros.<BR>Read this book as soon as you can!  Although this book is written for children, adults will enjoy it, too, maybe even more than kids because of the depth of its meanings.
B000005RFQ|2.0|BORN AGAIN: Black Sabbath's second comeback album produces a newer sound that is not so easy to listen to. Gillan's vocals are embarrassingly high at times and his lyrics seem to run together with the music so that we cannot really make out what he's saying.<br />The good things about this album is the outstanding STONEHENGE track and DISTURBING THE PRIEST. ZERO THE HERO has a dark lurking sound to it. The band sounded like they were really trying and they've managed to produce a short but solid album.<br />Overall, you have to be in the mood for something different. This is not a dance album. I think it might be a unique experience for Sabbath fans that are not too familiar with anyone other than Ozzy. Buy it if you're curious.
B0000640SA|1.0|Worst movie ever. It tries to be different, but it's nothing. Bad acting, bad plot, really a joke.
B000050XEI|5.0|This CD is remarkable.  Not only is Enya's voice beautiful and calming, but her lyrics are deep and thought-provoking. This CD has the already popular &quot;Only Time&quot; as well as &quot;Wild Child&quot;, but my personal favorite is &quot;One by One&quot;.  All of the songs are excellent, and have something unique to contribute to the overall album.
B00005PJ8I|2.0|This movie was a terrible bore.  Very exciting start when the plane went down, but very laughable to find out that Tom Hanks was able to survuve the crash from 20-25,000 feet.  Now, this was not reality, but come on.  Then it becomes a sleeper until the last 15 minutes when Hanks dialogue becomes more believable...
B00003CXI1|3.0|First, the bad. Then the good.<br /> When the DVD was announced, much was made in the advertisements of the Extra Scenes Not Seen in the Theater. This is of course one of the Cool Things (TM) about DVDs, they often have neat additional material. So my son and I were eagerly looking forward to seeing this. I hoped at first that some extra would be added to the movie itself, but it appears not. No problem, says I, we'll just go to the extras menu and go to the deleted scenes.<br /> There is no such selection.<br /> In fact, there is no selection which would TAKE you to such a selection.<br /> The extra material is there, of course. But to get to it you need to play through what amounts to an incredibly lame short semi-RPG game of puzzles and so on. And since the DVD can't remember such things, you have to play through this stupid sequence of actions *EVERY* *SINGLE* *TIME* you want to view the footage, unless you tape them to a VHS -- which, of course, removes a lot of the utility of a DVD.<br /> Take those responsible for the marketing out in the back, and shoot them. This is quite probably the most boneheaded design decision I've ever seen in corporate America, and that's saying quite a bit. One whole star off the rating for this moronic design flaw.<br /> Now, as to the movie itself...<br /> Most adaptations of books to the movies or television depart from their source material; sometimes it's a matter of a few liberties, but in many cases it's more a matter of systematic abuse and torture, often leaving the viewer wondering what the heck the point was of using the title if you weren't intending on filming the story CONNECTED with that title.<br /> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, however, hews very close indeed to the book from which it's derived; not surprising, since J.K. Rowling was given an unprecedented amount of control over the entire project. The major changes are cuts and compressions, something which is inevitable; even a relatively short book contains more material than can be put onscreen even in a long movie.<br /> Unfortunately, this does slightly damage the story. The original novel is a rather interesting fusion of three subgenres: the English Boarding-School adventure, the \\"child with mysterious background/powers\\" story[related to the Cinderella trope], and a classic mystery novel.<br /> The movie severely damages the mystery-novel aspect of the story, eliminating or downplaying important clues and rushing us along in the final solution. Reading the book permitted a clever reader to figure out what was going on before it was all revealed at the end of the book -- it was a \\"fair\\" mystery, one that did give you the chance to solve the problem without hiding crucial information. The movie, unfortunately, does leave out or severely understate some important clues. It also severely compresses several sequences, most notably Harry's time with his \\"evil step-family\\" the Dursleys.<br /> However, the rest of the book is kept virtually intact, with much of the dialogue taken verbatim and the scenes precisely as described. The casting ranges from \\"good\\" to \\"inspired\\"; I can't think of a single bad casting choice, and all the acting (which in a production with this many child actors is a major concern) is at worst workmanlike and at best is excellent. Alan Rickman as Snape and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid put in stellar performances, making the book characters spring to life perfectly.<br /> The edits -- especially the compression mentioned earlier and removal of the fiendish logic puzzle that protected the way to the Sorcerer's Stone -- do, in the end, rob this movie of its potential for perfection, but it remains an excellent, fun, and wonder-filled diversion, perfect for any age.tains more material than can be put onscreen even in a long movie.<br /> Unfortunately, this does slightly damage the story.

0140135154|3.0|Berger et al have produced an interesting work.  It isn't something you would need to just have around the house for fun though.<br />Great for teaching and/or exploring creativity.<br />Berger's emphasis on materialism/communism can get tired sometimes.
0385503954|2.0|Ok, I've never read McEwan before...there's a list of his books that I'd like to read, but after reading this one...<br />I don't know, I think I will give him one more chance.<br />This book was awful! It was very boring.<br />First, take the book, some 350 pages & flip through it looking through the words---see many quotes for conversations??<br />That's because there aren't many! That's one problem<br />Second, start reading if you like, then start to notice that the author uses 20 words to describe something where one work would have sufficed.  Then notice that this goes on, on EVERY page!!<br />This book could have been shortened up to probably 150 pages. Easy!<br />I had a very hard time getting through this book.  I love to read, and have a nice size vocab, but come on!!!<br />I'll admit the ending was interesting though. Curiosity kept me going to see what would happen
B00003CXWV|5.0|here's a film in which the lead character doesn't really want to be a gangster, but one circumstance leads to another circumstance and the next thing you know, he's meeting with Pablo Escobar, the biggest drug lord in the world. A very interesting journey, to say the least. Here's a movie that gives you another intriguing story of a \\"regular guy\\" who ends up in extra-ordinary circumstances, and with a little bit of street-smarts, a little bit of charm and a lotta balls, makes something out of himself. Mind you, I personally have always been fascinated with the biographies of famous people, so maybe this story won't grab you as much as it did me. But the actors are also all very good in this film, the high style in perfect alignment with the previously mentioned flicks and plenty of drama, bits of humor, betrayals and double-crossings
B00003CX8J|4.0|The first thing I have to say about \\"X-Men\\", and the only thing I really need to say, is that what makes it good is that it`s very creative and a lot more human than other action movies. Unlike when people came out of \\"Spiderman\\" saying, \\"I wish I had super powers so I could save the world,\\" this movie portrays the heroes as being cursed as well as gifted with their mutant abilities and makes them characters seem more believable.<BR>I wasn`t familiar with the details of the story of all the X-Men when I came into the theatre, but I knew of Wolverine, and the unanimated version of Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman, known mostly in this movie as Logan, is an awesome character who steals scene after scene. He often shares the screen with Anna Paquin, who plays the young Rogue that Logan becomes close to. And, staying loyal to the original X-Men story, he also takes a liking to Jean Grey, which causes a lot of tension between him and her boyfriend, Scott, known as the X-Man Cyclops. (This competition between them contributes to some of the funniest moments in the movie, such as when Logan seemingly displays his middle, um, blade at Scott.)<BR>I like that there`s a lot of feelings between the characters and it`s not just a romance sub-plot like in the Batman movies. The romance is actually a pretty insignificant part of the movie. The friendships make the X-men seem like very good people and distinguishes them easily form the villians so that they`re not just humans with superpowers just like the mutants they fight. (Might I mention the villians are just as cool as the good mutants. If I had to pick my favorite mutant aside from Wolverine I don`t know if it would be a villian or a good guy.)<BR>You should especially see this movie if you are a fan of the comics because the interpretation of the characters is extremely imaginitive, but even if you aren`t too familiar with X-Men you can really enjoy it anyway. And you should just see it no matter what because super hero movies are becoming extremely mainstream. See Spiderman for the action, but then go rent this because it`s a lot smarter.
B000066AXE|5.0|I couldn't see how they were going to turn Nash's bio into an interesting movie.  Well, they did. And although there were many good things about the movie, the very best was Crowe's acting job, which I think was an absolute masterpiece.
0316666343|5.0|I abandoned a week-end to this book and didn't care because it is a voluptuously good read.  Several passages in this were so startlingly beautiful that I had to put the book down for a moment to absorb them.  The protagonist and narrator, a fourteen-year-old girl from a nice family, is savagely killed by a neighbor and goes to heaven.  She describes her soul \\"shrieking from earth\\" in the violence of the act, adding that violent circumstances make the victim reach for death as one would a rope to swing out from danger.  Just gorgeous stuff like that.  I know these characters, this family.  They are like my own and many other girls'.  She wathches as her death transforms them all and she has such a beautiful young soul!!  I recommend this book without reservation to anyone who enjoys a good read.  Unique, charming, wistfully sad and never maudlin, sometimes funny (the tippling grandmother is a hoot).
0385335482|5.0|One of my best friends gave me this book for my 18th birthday because shopping is my favorite thing to do, and I do it even when I don't have any money left. All my friends know that I'm a shopaholic. This book is hilarious! I was reading it on an airplane and laughing out loud. The book really explains Becky's emotions well- she knows she shouldn't buy the Denny and George scarf, but it is just SOO beautiful! I go through the same experiences any time that I enter a store. However, Becky is not just a shopper- she is smart and witty and knows how to get what she wants in life. She is very powerful and manipulative. She is a wonderful icon for any woman. I love this book, and recommend it to anyone-- buy lots of copies and give them to all of your friends!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I came late to the Harry Potter Frenzy, but at least I can understand it now.  This was a great movie based on an even better book.  Some of the character interpretations were off in my estimation, but hey, I don't make movies, I just go see them.
B00000DCHE|5.0|I first saw Billy Joel live at the age of 7...by then I already owned most of his albums (apart from the 3 that my Mum already had), and this was the second of those (Following GH I and II). Fancy a six year old being given an album with a song like \\"Captain Jack\\" on it...oh well...<br />This is one of his very best releases...every song is a winner and every single one improves on the original studio versions -how many live albums even come close to matching the originals? This release made me think that \\"Turnstiles\\" must be a great album..oh well, that's about the only childhood dream I've had shattered by Mr. Joel, so I'll forgive him.<br />I couldn't pick a favourite song from this release if I wanted to - I couldn't even limit myself to six...if you want a sampler of Joel's early works, or just want a decent live album by the man you absolutely need to buy this CD.
B000066NW0|5.0|I saw Avril Lavigne's &quot;Complicated&quot; video on MTV and immediately knew she was talented (not to mention hot)! I bought the CD and was amazed to find that I loved every song. My favorites are &quot;I'm With You&quot;, &quot;Mobile&quot;, &quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot;, &quot;Things I'll never say&quot; and &quot;My World&quot;, but all the songs are great!<BR>I think all her songs deserve to be singles and be played on the radio. Only true fans who buy her album can really appreciate all she has to offer. This has to be the best CD I ever bought (And I'm a big music fan). Avril Lavigne is talented, beautiful and deserves to be the next big star! So go buy Avril's debut CD so she can make dozens more, you will not be disappointed!
B00003CXXP|4.0|Your enjoyment of this film will probably rely on two things: A) What preconceptions about the film you have and B) How you interpret the epilogue like ending.<br /> If you are expecting a pulse pounding, relentless action film or a happy-go-lucky feel good adventure you will be disappointed. Likewise, if you are expecting the film to kick up hitherto un-addressed questions and answer them with solid clarity, you will be disappointed.  As others here have wisely stated, this is neither a typical Spielberg or Kubrick film.  It is an interesting, if slightly flawed, mixture of the two.<br />The film's endings(s) are what seem to encourage the most debate, though. Many have complained that the film should have ended a half hour or so earlier than it did, or that the film does not resolve clearly.  Admittedly, there is a point in the film where it could have ended and still been enjoyable... leaving us with a dark resolution and a few questions.  Instead, we are offered an epilogue of sorts that attempts to clarify little David's (Pinocchio's) true nature. The sequence has a tender, touching sentiment to it that implies a \\"Spielbergian\\", facile cop-out on what could have been a more distressing statement.  But was this really the \\"happy-ending\\" that everybody seems to think destroyed the integrity of the film? Personally, I think many viewers got a little too emotionally attached to the little robot boy and as a result completely missed the point. Without spoiling it, I would say what I saw was a disturbing sequence of calculated and intentional storytelling made even more ironic by Spielberg's well-known knack for tugging at our heartstrings.  Basically, I am saying that I do not perceive this to be the happy ending that so many others seem to believe it is (whether they liked it or not). You must see it to and judge for yourself, though.<br />The acting is good and the FX are great... so no worries there. DVD is the perfect format for this well produced and moody fantasy. You may want to rent this film first and decide for yourself whether you like it enough to buy it or not. However, one thing is clear. As long as you are an aware viewer, this film will challenge, question and engage you, and you will form ideas and opinions about what you are viewing.  Just look at the disparate array of opinions right here!
6304595247|4.0|I thought Fiennes portrayal of Healthcliff was excellent. Physically, he wasn't quite as he should have been, however, he is excellent as the dark, brooding hero that you love and hate at the same time. Binoche, however, I thought left something lacking. While she does a fair job in her portrayal of Cathy, I always pictured her as a little more cruel than Binoche seems able to portray. In the novel, she revels in her power over Heathcliff and even seems to enjoy seeing his desperate pain for her. She doesn't quite achieve it in the movie. Sinead O'Conner was actually a pleasant surprise as well--- She has the perfect voice to be the author and doesn't actually have to do much acting, so she adds alot to the presentation.<br />In terms of faithfulness to the book, I thought it was excellent. I loved the dark passion of the book and I thought it carried over very well to the movie. All in all, I think it is definitely worth buying.
B000000OQF|5.0|About 1.5 months ago,I went out shopping and I walked into a music store and I came upon this album.I wanted to try something new,so I'm like what the hell,let's give this a shot.At first,I was kind of reluctant to listen to it,until one day I finally decided to,and to put it mildly,it was awesome!Let's run down the tracks,some of which I would rank higher than 5 out of 5 if I could:<br />Welcome To The Jungle-Ahhh,GREAT way to start out this album,from beginning to end there's a whole lot of fun in the jungle!5 out of 5<BR>It's So Easy-Sung in a lower tone of voice for most of the song,definetely awesome;5 out of 5<BR>Nightrain-I love this stuff and can't get enough!!!5 out of 5<BR>Out Ta Get Me-Real hard rocker,gets better and better the more I hear it!!!5 out of 5<BR>Mr.Brownstone-Cool,catchy guitar riffs give this album yet another 5 out of 5!!!<BR>Paradise City-Yet another great song on the album,Slash and Izzy do a great job towards the end;5 out of 5<BR>My Michelle-Good guitar riffs,rocks,not quite perfect but very enjoyable;4 out of 5<BR>Think About You-Good song,not outstanding,but once again,still enjoyed it;4 out of 5<BR>Sweet Child O' Mine-From Slash's beautiful guitar solo to the end,it's one of the greats,no doubts here;5 out of 5<BR>You're Crazy-Another real hard rocker,done a tad too fast in my opinion,but still not too shabby;4 out of 5<BR>Anything Goes-Catchy tune,and what's an album without a song about sex!!!LOL;4 out of 5<BR>Rocket Queen-One of my favorites,just an awesome thing to listen to for 6 minutes;5 out of 5<br />Really just completely amazed at how good this album was.Truly one of the great ones.I can't believe these one star reviews saying Axl's vocals are terrible as I honestly have NO idea what the hell they're talking about.I won't mistake Axl for a broadway singer,but he does a good job on this album.So,if you're looking for good rock music,avoid bands like Korn,Slipknot,and these black/death metal bands and get this,it's a MUCH better choice.
6304383827|5.0|I think people are giving this movie a bad rap. It is a very enjoyable movie...if what you are looking for is pure entertainment. It succeeds in accomplishing it's purpose, to merely provide an audience with a couple hours of mixed feelings. And the Hollywood version does a great job of that. I thought Paltrow did a great job with the character she was asked to portray...granted, it wasn't the Emma of Jane Austens novel, but that was not because of a lack of acting ability. I think it was simply that the writers for the movie weren't too particularly concerned with keeping the movie faithful to the novel. (Come on, people. We all know that the only thing novels and Hollywood adaptations are going to have in common are the names of the hero's and heroines.) But that doesn't make it a bad movie. Just enjoy it for what it is. Just don't watch it expecting to see anything that is really at all close to the book.<br />Basically, if you are looking for a movie with a little more meat, go with the A&amp;E version. All the characters, particularly Emma, are much better developed and 3 dimensional in the A&amp;E version. If you are looking for a movie that relates closely to what the author was trying to say, a movie that makes a statement about something, rather than providing mere entertainment, definely, go with the A&amp;E version. Otherwise, watch Paltrows Emma and enjoy it because is an excellent entertainment movie.
B0000062S0|2.0|No one was expecting Led Zeppelin reincarnated, but this is more like the leaves dropping off the tree.  Understated, and not exactly incendiary.  I was expecting a little more kick...perhaps John Paul Jones was missing.  This CD doesn't see much airplay on my player.  If you're a Zep fan, I would suggest looking to Robert Plant's solo works instead.
0140072187|5.0|I don't finish alot of books I get board quickly.  This story is so well told I could not put it down.  The detail of the situations encountered are what kept me reading.  This one is a keeper.  I will read it agian. There is so much in this book I know I missed some things.
0553103547|5.0|One day I stumbled upon A GAME OF THRONES while browsing through the library. I am forever grateful. George R.R. Martin has written an epic masterpiece that is intelligent, gripping, and reflective of the very best qualities of fiction (not just fantasy).<br />A GAME OF THRONES is a sweeping tale of the continent of Westeros, a land torn asunder by political intrigues. In King's Landing, capitol of the Seven Kingdoms, the mysterious death of the King's Hand sets into motion power plays and political games. Eddard Stark, a northern lord as hard as winter, is chosen by King Robert Baratheon as the new King's Hand. Stark is drawn into a game for which he has no taste, forced to leave his children and wife, yet duty-bound to discover the causes for the death of his friend Jon Arryn, the old King's Hand. But Stark finds that honor has no place in King's Landing, where the truth is a matter of deadly danger.<br />A GAME OF THRONES, through the use of multiple perspectives and masterful writing, is a powerful and unforgettable story about the shattered Seven Kingdoms. Pure good and pure evil holds no place in Martin's writing. We come to know every person as an individual, each with unique ambitions and dreams. Their reactions are realistic and human. Our ideas of an event are twisted and turned as we see it through the eyes of different characters, each of which have remained in my memory long after I have turned the last page.<br />I highly recommend A GAME OF THRONES, and moreover the entire \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series to anyone who is patient and enjoys reading. I promise that if you have these two qualities, you will not be disappointed.
B00003CXDB|3.0|I absolutely loved Wall Street!  When I first saw it in the theater as a teenger, I had absolutely no idea what was going on.  However, I went on to be a finance major in college & I finally understood the genius of the script.  I have the movie on tape (recorded it from HBO) & I was highly anticipating the DVD especially since it was going to be in wide-screen.  However, to my horror the wide-screen view is cropped from the full-screen version!!!  At first I thought was mistaken.  Then I set up 2 tv's - one hooked up to my vcr, the other to my dvd - & confirmed my suspicions.   Perhaps I got a defective dvd, but you can try this test on your own by renting both formats.  Extremely disappointed by the transfer!
B00003CX95|5.0|A good movie entertains you, and perhaps even gets you thinking about life, existence, the universe. A great movie grabs hold of you and never lets go. It alters your perspective of the world and imposes upon you its own vision whether you wish it or not. BRAVEHEART falls into that latter category. It is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the 90's.<br />     Set in medieval Scotland and England, BRAVEHEART depicts the life of William Wallace (Mel Gibson, who also directs), a Scottish rebel who challenges the cruel tyranny of the English king Edward the Longshanks. Wallace's life is one shaped by treachery, lost love, loyalty, and an insatiable human desire for freedom. In the span of three hours, we explore and come to understand his plight and motivations. <br />     Even through the great misfortunes of his life, Wallace remains hopeful and strong through tragedy. These emotions and ideas are so tangible and conveyed so effectively that it becomes impossible to ignore. Indeed, it is a testament to the insight and power of this movie that freedom fighters in Chechnya often looked to it for inspiration.<br />     If you've never seen BRAVEHEART before, you owe it to yourself to own a copy of this movie. This DVD also has a wonderful, revealing 3-hour commentary by Mel Gibson and a 30-minute &quot;making-of&quot; featurette. These are nice additions to an already fantastic movie. <br />     In short, I unequivocally recommend purchasing this DVD.
0380789035|2.0|Neil Gaiman's &quot;American Gods&quot; is a skewed, surreal and ultimately disappointing revival of the American Road Trip novel. Gaiman's writing is evocative enough to drag the reader from chapter to chapter, and he builds tension nicely, promising the reader a finale that will not only explain the thin-as-dishwater plot, but also resolve the dangling plot points he scatters along the way. In the end, Gaiman seems in a hurry to close the book, and rushes through conclusions quickly, dismissing a few as he goes.<br />The author does a nice job of introducing the &quot;gods&quot; of old into the modern American scene, but fails miserably to give any characterization to the &quot;new&quot; gods, and that comes off as a complete injustice to the reader. After all, the story is building to a climatic battle between the two forces, and yet the reader is not allowed a clear view of the purpose or intent of the &quot;new&quot; gods.<br />Some will find this novel brilliantly plotted and clever. I found it thin, weak in characterization, and lacking a satisfying conclusion. I skimmed the last 75 pages to finish book, and regret the impulse buy that made me pick it up in the first place.
B00005N83O|1.0|Big mistake. Waste of talented voice, she's been hanging around gangster rappers too long. I bought it for the song \\"Ain't it funny\\" thinking there might be more like it on there, and didn't realize the [stuff]about the murder remix until after opening it.<br />If you look at the CD, the song \\"I'M REAL, MURDER REMIX\\" is highlighted as if this is the song that's going to sell this CD (and probably will, since our culture has degenerated into this facination of murder and drugs and gangsters). The other songs are typical gangsta lingo, with the typical references to material items like cars and Rolex etc. The only decent and artistic song in there is \\"Ain't it funny\\" <BR>...
B00006690H|4.0|This album contains the usual celebrity bashing, battle rapping, anger filled style songs... but it also contains a different side of Eminem. There are emotional songs, music / political songs, and Em even experiments by using different production methods for songs (more instrument filled tracks)... <br />This could be an Eminem album either loved or hated by Eminem's long-time fans... some fans may be turned off by these songs because they sound less hiphop orientated, but for fans who are not afraid to hear something different this could be the perfect album for you... On an MTV2 interview Eminem stated that guitars are not used alot in hiphop and on this album he takes advantage of the instrument, and a good number of the tracks on this contain some guitar playing.... AND HE DID A GOOD JOB!!! It helped give the instruments more life and made them more tolerable to listen to as Em flowed over them...<br />Lyrically Eminem's flow has improved VERY WELL and he still contains that emotion behind the words, but it seems his vocab has gotten simpler... but then again as long as he proves his point, big words don't' matter....<br />Eminem addresses musical / political issues on \\"White America\\" where he talks about how racism in music benefited him. He talks about his downfall relationship with his mother on \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\". On \\"Sing For The Moment\\" Eminem talks about how musical influence on children may be nightmares for parents because they refuse to accept it. \\"Superman\\" is how Eminem brags he is the super-man that's SINGLE and brags about his lovelife. \\"Hailie's Song\\" is an ode to his daughter where he actually SINGS, which may have mixed reviews for some fans, but I enjoyed it...<br />Along with his 'serious' songs Eminem also has the playful / battle tracks. \\"Without Me\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Drips\\", \\"When The Music Stops\\", and a VERY VERY HOT TRACK \\"Say What You Say\\" where Dre and Em talk about how they handle their opponents...<br />But some songs do fail to capture me such as \\"Soldier\\", \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\", and even \\"'Till I Collapse\\" (the drumline is IRRITATING in it and hurt the track alot)... <br />Overall it's definitely a good album by Eminem... It may satisfy some, but it may turn off others... It matters how open people are to different material... There's still plenty shiners on here.... Only reason it doesn't get a 5-star rating is because it seems that in areas it could've been better, but its above average all over....<br />If u like Eminem, check out Chino XL... Chino, the King of Punchlines, was hiphop's first celebrity basher and he may have influenced Eminem to diss everyone too... give Chino his well deserved props and pick up \\"I Told You So\\" and \\"Here To Save You All\\"...<br />I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
B00006690G|5.0|Anyone who thinks they hate rap, or loves rap - you WILL love this cd.  One of my close friends hated all rap, but loves this CD.  Whether you're looking for great lyrics, or kickin' beats, The Eminem Show is amazing.  Although he's less controversial, his lyrics are possibly even more media-worthy.  Never before have I heard lyrics so honest.  In \\"White America\\" he tells everyone that his appearance is a large factor in the reason of his success.  He's a good-looking white rapper, which helped him achieve media spot-light, and his connections with Dre certainly did not hurt.  Once again he tells about his pains and frusterations, but never sounding repetative.  His beats are amazing.  His rhymes and rhythms are continuous and free-flowing.  You HAVE to give this CD a chance.  I doubt he'll ever be able to top this cd....even though I said that about the Marshall Mathers LP.
0679412719|5.0|In an age where so many of us tune into Oprah, Dr. Phil, and so many other feel good fountains of wisdom, its refreshing to revisit the men who laid the foundations for thought in modern time. Marcus Aurelius' statements sometimes come off as trite, obvious, or even dull; however, one must only remember that he was one of the first to put these notions down on paper to realize how important and interesting the work is. Extolling on the virtues of restraining one's emotions and sacrificing for the greater good, this long gone emperor still strikes home with his platitudes and musings. Don't pass this easy to read selection over because it might seem irrelevant; everyone can learn something from a people who once ruled the known world.
B00005B36H|5.0|I keep reading countless reviews and lists calling Tool metal. Tool is not metal. Tool is one of those bands that doesn't really fit into any category. This album is excellent though. Tool's second best (with aenima being first).
B0000203YT|2.0|I could hardly sit through this movie.  Could Shakespeare really have been so incredibly stupid as to have sex in very public places, with all odds of getting caught, with a girl dressed as a man, (a woman acting at this time was a crime, in which she could be severely punished--if he really \\"loved\\" her, wouldn't he care more about her safety?).  This wasn't love--just pure and simple lust.  They never really have any conversations, only recite lines from his play and then jump into the sack.  Let's just call it Shakespeare in Bed and be done with it.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones flaunts her sauciness like nobody's business.  But you don't hate her for it. Her debut cd showcases deceptively simple songs that detail a slippery knot of a life.  She parades her piano playing and her lush voice around as if she has been doing this for decades instead of just a few years. The first time I heard I Don't Know, I assumed Edie Brickell produced something new.  Upon another listen, I noticed fewer similarities.  Ms. Jones is carving out her own groovy style.  She exudes more class and sass than most of the &quot;crotch for the camera&quot; girls singing top 40 pop today.   Feeling the Same Way  is a sunny song, ripe for humming.  Come Away with Me is the golden song or the one Blue Note is banking on to bring in the revenue.  It isn't bad but it not as good as the #9 track. I've Got to See You Again showcases her abilities to go deep and to stay sultry.  Norah Jones is not merely on her way.  She is almost there.
0385503954|5.0|In Atonement, Ian McEwan has written both a powerful and deeply affecting \\"old-fashioned\\" narrative that in many ways recalls and updates the best of E.M. Forster (Think Howard's End and A Passage to India) and a postmodern work that calls into question the ability of fiction to represent life (Think Borges and Calvino). In fact, McEwan handles the machinery of the traditional novel -- vividly realistic settings (a summer day at an English country house in the mid-30s, the British retreat to Dunkirk, a London hospital in the early months of World War II), sympathetic characters, suspense-filled plot -- so expertly that I remain somewhat ambivalent about the need for the postmodernism. It seems as if McEwan is uncomfortable with his emotions -- and the emotions his story creates in his readers -- and so must distance himself intellectually from the passions of his characters; or maybe he is telling us something about keeping emotions in balance with intelligence. Read the book yourself and decide.
B0000033TE|4.0|This is usually referred to as ELP's best album. I think that's a matter of personal taste, as I actually prefer \\"Trilogy\\" to this one. BSS is certainly their most complicated, with weird time changes flying left and right. Not for the faint of heart, (except for \\"Still you Turn Me On\\", a typical pretty ballad from Lake). \\"Jerusalem\\" is great, \\"Toccatta\\" is downright scary, good music to annoy your neighbors with! And \\"Benny the Bouncer\\", well what can you say, it's stupid, but has some nice honky-tonk piano playing. I don't think \\"Karn Evil 9\\" really holds up as the \\"concept piece\\" it is supposed to be, but the music is certainly grand, and Lake's guitar solo in the middle of the 1st impression is tasty and very melodic.<br />I've just been getting back into ELP, and havent really listened to them since high school days. These remastered Rhino releases sound great. This BSS CD has a cool \\"double-vision\\" version of the H.R.Giger cover art. Still not as cool as the original LPs' cover, (which I still have!) The CD also has some interviews with the guys at the end, with some humorous notes on Giger and the cover artwork. To really see \\"it\\" you need the full sized album cover.<br />If you are new to ELP, this is certainly one to own, but give \\"Trilogy\\" a listen, and also the live \\"Welcome Back My Friends...\\"
B00005YUPO|5.0|My daughter is now a year old, but I bought this for her when she was 2 months old.  Believe it or not she would sit for hours in her swing and stare at this video!  To this day she LOVES it!  I have honestly found that the \\"Baby E\\" series are the ONLY tapes that actually work.  I have bought all of them for her now, and thank goodness I did!  You will not be sorry that you bought this, I promise!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love this CD!  I listen to it at work, I listen to it in the car, and I put it in my CD player as soon as I get home.  I think I'm going to have to buy another one soon as I'll have worn out all the grooves on this one.  There's not one song on this CD that I don't like.  St. Patrick's Day is my favorite, but all the rest are in the #2 position.  Do NOT hesitate to buy this CD!
0679735909|5.0|I spent a whole weekend in bed reading this book, and when I finished I started all over again. Possession has everything in it: literary detective story, epistolary love affair, 19th century epic poetry, academic intrigue, slowly simmering romance. In a nutshell, two 20th century literary scholars, Roland Mitchell and Maud Bailey, uncover evidence of a previously-unknown relationship between the two 19th century poets they study, Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel La Motte, respectively. Realizing their findings may overturn received wisdom on these poets and their work, Roland and Maud pull out all stops to figure out what went on between them, nasty academic rivals hot on their heels. Beyond the wonderfully suspenseful plot, Possession is a tale about knowledge: how knowledge is built through scholarship, how knowledge of the past must come through the written word, how knowledge may be only problematically related to 'truth.' To appreciate this book fully, it helps to like 19th century English poetry, as many clues are embedded in the mock poems of Ash and La Motte; however, if such poems are not to your taste, they can be fruitfully skimmed. But then, this is part of the beauty of the book: it offers a rich, nuanced story for your mind to roam over, and while the plot itself is wonderful, if you choose to read thoughtfully and delve into the nuance, Byatt gives you much, much more to pleasurably contemplate.
B000007T1M|5.0|This is truly original metal. Very musical, quirky, and hard. I would almost say progressive. I can't believe that some people put SOAD in the same category as ... Limp Bizkit, Korn, etc. Serj Tankian is the best singer since Mike Patton. If you like this you might also like Meshuggah, or even Mr Bungle.
B000002H97|3.0|Despite the album's overall commercial success, I find that I am bored with the new album after only running through it a couple of times. As a fan who grew up on, \\"Seek and Destroy,\\" and, \\"Creeping Death,\\" (Which I doubt many of you have even heard of), this album is a plummet into \\"Top 40 Land.\\" While somewhat \\"hard,\\" the songs on this album were obvioulsy written for the radio. Introspective tracks such as, \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" and \\"Unforgiven,\\" don't hold a candle to, \\"Fade to Black,\\" or \\"One.\\" \\"Enter Sandman,\\" is a laughable effort at the bands attempt to duplicate the feel of tracks such as \\"Master of Puppets,\\" and \\"One.\\" When this first came out I hoped in my mind that surely this was just a brief experiment in \\"Top 40 Land,\\" and that Metallica's follow ups would be a return to the hard, edgy metal that first brought me to Metallica. But after the release of the terrible mediocre \\"Load\\" and the forgettable \\"Reload,\\" I doubt the Metallica of old will return to give us more angry, ground breaking music. Overall, great for those new to Metallica and just wanting to feel that they have an angry-metal side to themselves. But for fans of the good old Metallica, I feel that you'll be as disappointed as I was. Hopefully in the future we will see the boys return on the track that \\"...And Justice For All,\\" was leading them.
B00005YU1O|1.0|a friend recommended this one to me and was certain i'd love it. the trusting soul that i am, i didn't even rent the sucker, i just went ahead and bought the dvd. wow was she wrong! this is a really bad film.<br />although it's considered \\"animated,\\" it cheats with that false, trace-over-the-filmed-footage type of \\"animation.\\" all the character expressions are kept limited to the acting originally shot. nothing is exaggerated visually and there doesn't seem to be any benefit or reason for its use, outside of decoration. humdrum decoration at that.<br />the look reminded me of that animated earthlink advertising campaign that showcased \\"real life\\" characters expressing various monologues about their online experiences. i was suspicious in fact, that maybe some of the same animators were used here.  but whereas the earthlink ads took the opportunity to use the animation in a way that complimented the dialogue and brought a fresh dimension to the words and made sense and pushed some cool visual concepts and then brought it back again, here you just couldn't care less because nothing interesting happens. nothing. well, okay...i think there was a scene or two where a guy levitates quietly out of the master frame (ooh...goosebumps).<br />so much for style.<br />in terms of the actual meat of the story, there was none. no meat AND no story, although i'll excuse the latter as its importance is essentially unnecessary.  this one really makes a horrible attempt at one of those \\"rambling discussion\\" types of films like 'my dinner with andre' or 'mindwalk,' two films i enjoyed immensely by the way, but this one was pure drivel.  painful pseudo-intellectualism at its chalkboard-scratched worst.<br />listen, when you've got the bong out burning and this stuff STILL sounds stupid and annoying, you KNOW it's gotta be pretty bad...<br />it was like listening to the awkward guy in line in front of you at the movies, trying like hell to impress his date. he makes all kinds of gesturesand strokes his chin and wanders at the stars, and says absolutely nothing, but he says it loud enough to benefit his date as well as the lucky couple 4 patrons back. you are in the presence of the national poster child for the campaign that \\"quotable, quote books should be banned forever!\\"<br />that's what this is. that exactly describes 'waking life.'<br />and if i forgot to mention it earler: this is a really bad film. <br />good luck with your decision on whether to watch it. i hope these thoughts were somewhat helpful.  and a special 'thank you' to the person in sacramento who took it off my hands through the amazon used items.  i sincerely hope your experience was entirely different from mine.

B00003CXRM|5.0|Set during the great depression, this movie tells the story of the adventures of three escaped convicts on their way to a treasure which the main character, George Clooney, convinces the other two to go after it with him.  They are chained together so Clooney has to do quite a selling job to get them to go and thus win his own freedom.  They escape their chain gang and the adventures that befall them from start to finish are amazing. Best of all, the comedy is so well played by these three characters that you forget you're watching a movie! I laughed so hard my face hurt.<br /><br />Whether you buy or not, and I recommend that you do, you have GOT to see this movie!
B0000669JL|5.0|Anyone with taste is going to love this album.  Has classic Marley tunes that even the most cursery reggae fan will know.  While I don't consider myself by any stretch a true reggae afficinado, this is the one album I own on vinyl, tape and now CD.  One Love, which frankly I skip over becuase all I can think of are the commercials now when I hear it, is still a great didity.  For Eric Clapton fans, here the orginal version of I Shot the Sheriff.  Buffalo Soldier and others are just truly classic songs.  From begining to end this CD is wonderful.  The two bonus tracks are OK and don't take anything away, but also don't add much to this wonderful collection.  VH1, for those who care, has this listed as one of the Ultimate Albums.  If you've never listened to reggae before, there is no better place to start than with this artist and this album.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is best experienced over and over.  I've seen the movie about forty times, and my husband and I quote it frequently. (Great quotes for all occasions:  Dieting? \\"Wanna chocolate?\\" ... Someone cut you off on the freeway? \\"Stupid is as stupid does.\\" ... You're an executive subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury? \\"That's all I have to say -- about that.\\")<br />Forrest Gump, a loveable innocent with an I.Q. of 75, stumbles through life pretty much without a clue (\\"Would you believe it? After five years of playing football I got a college degree!\\") -- yet he somehow manages to become a football star, a war hero, and a successful businessman.<br />Only in America.<br />The special effects in this one are absolutely amazing.  Forrest shakes hands with JFK, peeks over George Wallace's shoulder, and shows Linden B. Johnson his butt-cheek.  It's all totally first class stuff.<br />Adventure addicts will love the war scenes (which were bloody, but not nauseating)... Comedy buffs will love Forrest's ability to be funny without meaning to... Romantics will love the unconditional adoration Forrest showers on Jenny (a confused and often abused girl who only too late realizes that what she was looking for was there all along)... History buffs will love figuring out what year it is by what events are going on at the time... This movie has something for everyone! <br />(Due to the violence, partial nudity and foul language, however, parents should see this first.  I wouldn't recommend viewing by anyone under 13.) <br />Don't rent this one -- BUY IT for your video/dvd library and watch it often.
6300215512|5.0|Billy Wilder's drama about a hack screenwriter and an aging movie star shouldn't really be as good as it is - but there is not a single film critic I've ever read or encountered who would say that this film wasn't in their top 10 of the finest films ever made.<br />Gloria Swanson portrays Norma Desmond, a wealthy, aging silent film actress who yearns for a return to the screen. As luck would have it, a destitute screenwriter (William Holden) with the possible talents to assist her arrives at her doorstep. <br />The script treatment that Norma has created is terrible. The script for Sunset Boulevard is pure gold!<br />Holden is miraculously animated in this film (on the whole, I don't think he really put forth much effort in his craft). Swanson delivers the performance she was born to give (she was nominated for an Oscar). At the time, the part was considered poison for any actress who would take the role - as it would be acknowledging not only age in the actress, but a non-existent career. In short, the script was considered to be too close to home for most actresses beyond 30.<br />Peppered throughout this film are some of the greatest casting roles ever delivered: Cecil B. DeMille plays himself wonderfully. Erich von Stroheim plays Max, Norma's devoted butler (von Stroheim was not an actor, but rather one of Hollywood's golden directors - and a scandalous one at that) and milks the role for all it's worth. Hedda Hopper, Buster Keaton and many others pop up in roles as themselves.<br />Perhaps, though, the real stars of the film are Norma's mansion and her car (an Isoto Franchesa)upholstered in real leopard skin. Sadly the mansion has long since been demolished for the construction of Century City.<br />Sunset Boulevard is to remain a classic forever. And it almost seems that the film was created to forever cement the image of \\"old\\" Hollywood, so that future generations could discover what real movie stars were and what it meant to have that kind of power.
B000066AXC|5.0|As much as I love Denzel Washington (who, incidentally, was totally robbed of the Best Actor Oscar he deserved for Hurricane), Russell Crowe's performance here was phenomenal (much better than his performance in Gladiator, because this was a much more difficult role to play).  I don't know about any &quot;racial politics&quot; (I think the previous reviewer is a little confused there), but it's obvious that Russell has ticked off someone at the Academy, and therefore was robbed of the Oscar.<br />A Beautiful Mind is based on the life of John Nash, a brilliant man who, at length, outsmarts his psychological illness.  <br />Describing this movie is difficult without giving anything away...  Beautiful Mind takes the viewer on a journey, and just when you are sure you know where you are going, you discover that you had never really left in the first place.  <br />A most amazing movie with twists and turns that rival The Firm and Sixth Sense.  Best picture of the year.
B0000004V2|5.0|This album is really a masterpiece! I allways think of what my top ten/five albums of all time are and this GEM allways makes it. If u like this check out, 'The La's'- they only made 1 album, and Paul Weller's, 'Wild Wood' these three albums could have made the 60's stay FOREVER!
B000001C6D|3.0|I have to say I'd agree with whoever gave this album less than 3 stars.  All the songs here are the same,, I could not tell a difference between 1st and 10th but they are however in between melodic and heavy but not as heavy as early metallica. All of the members are very skilled musicians and can come up with interesting sounds here and there. Besides that,there's really nothing I can point my finger at could be outstanding in any way. This leads me to say that Draconial Times is better than Icon for few reasons. Get it and you'll find out why.
B00005Y228|5.0|Remember that song that you loved at first but after you heard the LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA refrain for the 30 gazillionth time you kinda got sick of..well that was the biggest single of the aussie, KYLIE MINOGUE's career and is still not getting out of some peoples heads worldwide as her kylie fever tour is selling out where it goes. Besides &quot;can't get you outta my head&quot;, FEVER delivers 11 other very strong dance tunes that keep you well..DANCING till the end. Other singles lifted from FEVER so far include the controversial &quot;IN YOUR EYES&quot;..shes being sued for the song and the new us single..(i wouldnt call it a hit yet) &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;. Please note that the record does not include the remix of the song and you can thank capitol records for that..but still, i promise you the ALBUM VERSION is better and with the other 11 songs FEVER will become one of your favourite records quite quickly. From dance to disco to ballads to rocking tour closers..fever has got it all..so give her a try. THERE IS MORE TO KyLIE than  LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA...
B00004XQ83|5.0|No one could've ever imagined an album like this walking away with as many Grammy Awards as it did; most notably \\"Album Of The Year\\", and \\"Best Country Male Vocal\\", said honor going to the 75 year old bluegrass banjo pioneer Ralph Stanley, whose musical career started in the late 1940's with his brother Carter Stanley. Together, the Stanley Brothers recorded for Columbia and Mercury records, where they recorded (and wrote) many of the most pivotal bluegrass songs, before moving to independent labels in the late 1950's and early 1960's such as the Nashville-based Starday Records,and the Cincinnati based King Records, among others. Ralph Stanley was one of the \\"big 3\\" of the bluegrass 5-string banjo hierarchy; along with Don Reno and the chief cornerstone Earl Scruggs, who also walked away with a Grammy Award for \\"Best Country Instrumental\\" with his all-star remake of his 1950 classic \\"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\\". The career of the Stanley Brothers ended December 1, 1966 when elder brother Carter Stanley passed away. Ralph Stanley toughed it out on his own keeping the Clinch Mountain Boys band intact and going on to even greater heights. Honors seem to come late in life to bluegrass performers, and like the Patriarch of Bluegrass Bill Monroe, Ralph is finally getting worldwide attention for his lifetime of hard work. Not being in the \\"Nashville Loop\\" with connections to the Grand Ole Opry or the studio scene, he's always taken a back seat to Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs, and ironically to Rick Skaggs, who worked for him in the early 70's, and who went on to his own major label deal in the early 80's. The whole \\"O Brother\\" album is pure Appalachia, with Ralph's two contributions; his riveting, haunting, keening rendition of the acapella \\"O Death\\" and one of his aforementioned 1955 Mercury recordings of \\"Angel Band\\" serving as two of the album's musical gems. Again, the whole album is a slice of pure Appalachia, although the movie itself takes place in the deep south of the 1930's. This writer's own personal favorite scene in the movie was the riverside baptism scene completely reinforced and transformed into a beatific religious experience by the ethereal, ever-building rendition of \\"Down To The River To Pray\\" by Alison Krauss backed by the First Baptist Church Choir of White House, Tennessee. There are numerous other curious \\"ironies\\" connected with the \\"O Brother\\" phenomenon; its \\"hit single\\" as it were, \\"Man Of Constant Sorrow\\" is sung here by Dan Tyminski, of Alison Krauss' band. This is another song brought into the bluegrass song catalog by-you guessed it, Ralph Stanley (and his brother Carter) in 1949 during their Columbia Records period, and it's been one of Ralph's most requested songs on his concerts down through the years. The saddest irony is the recent passing away of John Hartford (along with his wife several months later), although he lived long enough to see this project strike gold. Perhaps the most intellectually satisfying irony is watching the sales and success of this album go through the stratosphere--with absolutely NO HELP WHATSOEVER from so-called \\"Country Radio\\", a misnomer if ever there was one. \\"Country Radio\\" has become country music's self-inflicted wound. Nashville never seems to ever learn from its past mistakes; its 'cookie cutter' system of star-making where everybody looks so damned pretty, including the guys!; its over-produced albums where the same 12 studio musicians are on every single album...no wonder it all sounds the same...and BORING. The only difference in any of \\"today's country\\" is in the lead vocals--and the female ones at that!!!  Make no mistake about it--the \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\" album is THE REAL THING...alive and well and thriving in the 21st century...and Thank God for that!p south of the 1930's.

After eagerly devouring \\"Emma,\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", \\"Persuasion\\" and many of her other novels, I started \\"Mansfield Park\\" with equal eagerness. I enjoyed every part of the book up to the very end. The characters were well drawn, each a distinct and unique personality that I've come to expect in Jane Austen's works.
B000002OCP|3.0|Muddy Waters' name by itself evokes the sound of the roots blues that made his name so worthwhile through the development of the blues.  His powerful early acoustic music and the pioneering electric blues he played are still the standard by which the blues is measured.  But by 1968, he had been largely forgotten in favor of the psychedelic blues of Jimi Hendrix and his ilk.  So, in a bold move, an imprint of Chess Records cut this searing album and put his name back into play in the pop music world.<br />Muddy himself complained after the album was released that this wasn't real blues.  After all, he argued, the music was so dependent on studio effects that it couldn't be reproduced live on stage.  This, to Muddy, was the hallmark of true blues, and it left a bitter taste in his mouth.<br />Many blues lovers will agree.  Though this album reprises many of Muddy's most loved cuts, including \\"Mannish Boy\\" and \\"Hoochie Coochie Man,\\" the sound has little in common with Muddy's trademark organic growl.  He doesn't even play guitar on this album, despite the back-cover photo of him holding a science-fiction-shaped axe.  Essentially, Muddy often comes across as nothing more than hired talent.<br />As late-sixties acid-drenched rock, the album pays off fairly well.  The feedback that dominates the sound and the manic drums, suggesting \\"Inna-gadda-da-vida,\\" make Hendrix and Mitch Mitchell seem like precursors rather than trendsetters.  A remake of the Rolling Stones' \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" and a period piece, the socially conscious \\"Herbert Harper's Free Press News,\\" complement the hippie era that was just getting its steam going when the album was released.<br />Not everyone will like this album.  Some people will hate it.  However, as Muddy Waters' \\"White Album,\\" it's a safe bet and a reasonable investment for casual fans of rock and blues.
0807282375|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read.  Even though it's a fantasy story, its characters are so real.  The action never stops, and there's suspense at every turn.  Plus, real heroine qualities are revealed by Lyra.  Her bravery, courage, and compassion will not only grip you, but inspire you as well.  This book also has hidden meanings that reveal human nature in alien forms.  Everyone, even adults, should read this wonderful, excellent book.  Believe me - you will love it and never want to put it down once you start.<BR>This book also causes you to feel real emotions.  When there's heartbreak, it's real, and you may even cry.  There's also love and betrayal - all in all, this book is very touchy.  It's basically a book of true emotions and the human nature.  Read it as soon as you can!
B00005JGAB|5.0|I love the Ramones, and I'm typically uncritical about pretty much everything they did, except for maybe a few albums which were too slickly produced later on (&quot;End of the Century&quot; and &quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot; are probably the best examples), but if I had to give one and only one recommendation of a regular, non-hits Ramones album, this would be it.  They were young, poor, hungry and rebellious, and it shows.  The new demos are probably overkill, but you can always program your player not to include them if you want to hear the original Ramones album in all it's glory.
B00000F169|5.0|Much like George Lucas' THX-1138, Dark Star had its beginnings as a film school project which was later expanded into a full-length movie with the help of later investors.  However, while Lucas became far less serious when he started working with big budgets, the opposite phenonmenon occured with Dark Star's creators Dan O'Bannon (later scripter of such hits as Alien and The Abyss) and John Carpenter (later director of such hits as The Thing and Halloween).  In fact, Dark Star often seems to make fun of elements found in Carpenter and O'Bannon's later works, as if they knew what directions they would later be taking and decided to parody themselves before anyone else got the chance.  For example, there's an alien that looks like a blown-up beachball bouncing around the ship and causing trouble, providing a very silly alternative to the insect in Alien.  Of course, other classics are billiantly parodied in this movie as well, especially 2001 with its out of control, intelligent computer and in the scene of astronauts floating off into space. <br />Much like Monty Python, the humour works on many levels.  In addition to slapstick, you get rather intelligent and philosophical humour.  Not all of it works, but there are enough hits to make up for all the misses.<br />Given the original budget of the film, don't expect a visual spectacular.  Comparing Dark Star to the creators' later works is like comparing Lord of the Rings to Peter Jackson's first film, Bad Taste.  This first film has a sort of roughness and lack of polish to it which really emphasizes its moments of brilliance. Too bad the film isn't longer.

0738206679|4.0|&quot;Linked&quot; gives a good overview of what networks are and the effects they have on phenomena like business, mathematics, marketing and biology. The author does however seem to think no one knew about networks and network effects until he started researching it in 97 or 98. So if you know something about networks this will be a bit irritating. If you've read &quot;New rules for the new economy&quot; by Kevin Kelly a lot of the thoughts are going to be old news but Barbasi does take the ideas one step further and that makes the book worth a read.

B00000DC10|5.0|With this being my first Refused album, it was quite easy for them to become one of my favorite bands of all time. <br />They are one of the few artist who can pull off techno riffs mixed with hardcore screams and guitar and not sound completely ridiculous. <br />Dennis Lyxzen has one of the best hardcore voices. He can deliver blood curdling screams like in \\"The Deadly Rhythm\\", then shows he can actually sing, too in \\"Liberation Frequency\\". <br />This is hard because words cannot possibly describe this album. If you've read what others have said, which is mostly that it's amazing, then times that by 10, because this really is worth the hype.<br />I love bands that don't really fit into genres, and Refused were one of them, which is why this album will always remain in my favorites list.

The scenes of desparate combat will thrill and terrify you. Moore's insight into the strategic implications of this battle within the crazy quilt of the American experience in Vietnam will amaze you. Chances are, the chapter on the impact of the battle on the bereaved widows and orphans of troopers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the Valley of Death will make you cry. Don't miss this book, or the excellent movie recently made from it.
B00003CXMG|5.0|A movie that takes you back there to the 70's.  This movie is great.  If you liked Rock Star then you will definitely like this. And watch the making of on the DVD, its cool.  I am waiting for my copy of the bootleg version.
B000007R0S|5.0|As far as BOB (read more about me,  from boston) goes...if this collection is THAT bad then why hasn't he done something better! This guy is so tone deaf he couldn't play a radio! The EAGLES have established themselves as one of the greatest music groups of the 20th century, and with good reason. Hit after hit after hit. They have worked hard for what they have accomplished and yet they still are going strong after 30 years. Sure, they have had their ups and downs, but then who hasn't after that length of time. Every single member of the group is a top notch musician. (This DOES NOT include Bob from Boston). Extremely hard work and perseverence have put the EAGLES where they are today. Exceptional music, exceptional lyrics and devotion to their fans. (Vote for Joe Walsh). If you feel this review is incorrect, do yourself a favor... fork over the cash to see them in concert! I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed. (except for maybe Bob from Boston). Grow up and get a life Bob. To Don, Glen, Timothy and Joe - Thanks for the fantastic performance you provided 06/28/02. Looking forward to seeing you again very soon.

B000059Z8J|3.0|The imagery and soundtrack of this DVD are wonderful.<br />However, in the early '80s Superman The Movie was broadcast for television here in Australia and was about 177 minutes long. This is nearly three hours. The two \\"deleted\\" scenes found in the \\"Special Edition\\" were actually included in the television broadcast. These two deleted scenes I refer to as the \\"Feed the babies Otis\\" scene and the scene when Lex is playing piano while singing \\"You must have been a beautiful baby\\" as Otis lowers Miss Tessmocker who is to be the next meal for the \\"babies\\". Superman saves her of course.<br />Much of the humour in the relationship between Lex, Otis and Miss Tessmocker is lost because the DVD is missing so many shots/scenes.<br />The only scene I noticed on the DVD that was not in the '80s television broadcast is a short scene where we see some people looking at the lastest news reports on some TVs in a shop window.<br />...<br />All in all, I have to say that I expected more footage, and not less, in a so-called \\"Special Edition\\" version of Supmerman and I was most disappointed. I feel as though I have been short-changed. The DVD has lost some of the humour that was in the three hour version and for me is not quite the real thing. :o/<br />Thank you.
B00004Z459|5.0|There just aren't enough words to describe this CD. Usually I get a CD and listen to 1 or two tracks and get sick of it and it just collects dust. This, however, does not hold true for this CD. I don't like rap, but Linkin Park pulls off a not quite rap, not quite techno, not quite rock blend that is great. I can listen to this CD for a week put it away for a da or two then pull it out and it's like it's a brand new CD. If you're one of the few people who don't yet own this CD, crawl out of your rock and get it. You will absolutely love it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Contrary to Mr. Wright's criticism of Mayer's \\"Dave Matthews-wannabe vocals\\" and \\"self-deprecation\\", this is by far one of the best albums I have ever purchased. Not only do the phenomenal musical arrangements succeed in soothing and relaxing the mind, but I am blown away by the poetry expressed in Mayer's lyrics. His songs are truly beautiful, capturing emotion without overpowering his audience with complicated instrumentals. His music is simple, which is they key to its beauty, and I enjoy every minute that I am listening to this album. You will not be disappointed!!
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|One of the big questions about the four-disc edition of Pearl Harbor is just what exactly they changed in the director's cut. ...<br />Of course, the most noticeable change is the addition of gore in the many battle scenes. The carnage includes:<br />* Limbs flying. In scenes with explosions where sailors were just knocked away in the old edition, they now lose arms and legs. In addition, a quick new scene was edited back in where one sailor is brutally spun and tore up by an explosion.<br />* A severed head is seen rolling right in the camera frame with chunks of \\"meat\\" dangling out.<br />* The Captain is seen holding his intestines in his hands when Cuba comes to his aid.<br />* More gore can be see in the many strafing sequences with chunks of arms and legs being torn out.<br />* Severed hands and legs can be seen lying around in the hospital sequence's.<br />Besides those additions, there were a few quick cuts here and there throughout the film. With the state of the art DTS surround mix and widescreen picture this pack is the top of the line for a Pearl Harbor movie fan, but how ever for the first time ever the dvd studio used cardbord case's to hold all 4 dvd's, now that is a very BIG no no. Don't buy it if you want to keep it longer than 12 months or when you do buy it go out and buy 4 dvd case's to put all of the Pearl Harbor dvd's into. The pack looks great but dvd's sitting cardbord covers, come on, geat real how did they think of such a dumb thing to do.<br />5 stars for the movie and special featues <BR>2 stars for the packageing
B000002KAT|5.0|I have been reading the other reviews posted on this site, and I think it's safe to say they have all missed the point.  This album isn't about being &quot;pretty,&quot; it's not about &quot;romping&quot; or making &quot;fun&quot; music.  This album is a myriad of images which portray deep pain and sorrow.  Madame George is the musical equivalent of the feeling one experiences after losing a loved one.  Slim Slow Slider is perhaps the most emotionally raw song, with its snapping bass and lonesome, longing saxophone, ending suddenly with a vicious stab of ugly slapping and snapping and squeaking coming from the instruments, expressing the sudden breathtaking smashing of everything the singer knew to be beautiful.  Beauty is not the foremost goal of this album, rather exploration of a deeper kind of pain is:  The pain that life centres around, that every one of must experience if we are to ever become whole.  To say that Sweet Thing is a pretty song is missing the entirely point, missing the dark and painful undertones which accompany its imagery of love and happiness.  Of course, the meaning of the album would be lost if it weren't for the masterful instrumentation, especially the bass, flute, and lead guitar, which all provide complex and profound backdrops for the vocal play which takes place.  However, this album is not meant to be enjoyed when listening to it.  It is cathartic, it is beautiful, it is strong, but it is not enjoyable in a conventional sense.  Those who prefer The Beatles Revolver to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band will not appreciate this album for what it is, but will instead be put off by its lack of pop sensability.  Real fans of music and emotion, however, will find an experience in this album, something to hold and love, however much it might hurt us to do so.

B00005ATQE|5.0|\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is two movies in one.  Okay, some would argue that that the Tet Offensive and sniper scenes should each be given full billing.  But I'm more concerned with the violent change in tone and agenda that takes place between the training scenes and the in country carnage.<br />Part one begins with a montage of the film's actors getting their heads shaved at the beginning of basic training.  It's a ridiculous moment, funny and sweet and visceral, culminating in a pile of hair on the ground, and a batch of brand new men ready to be molded.<br />What follows is forty-five minutes of R. Lee Ermey showing the world that he's the hardest damn drill sergeant ever captured on celluloid.  Sergeants Toomey (\\"Biloxi Blues\\"), Foley (\\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\") and Hulka (\\"Stripes\\"), some of my personal favourites, ain't got nothing on his Sergeant Hartman (Hard man?).  He's locked into fourth gear, loud as the heavens crashing down, and funny as hell.  The racism, profanity, and insults that hurl forth from his mouth are sculpted and precise, almost passing for poetry.  I suspect Ermey himself came up with a lot of it himself, having served 11 years in the Marine Corps in real life.  Kubrick uses Ermey to mold and shape his actors/soldiers, before sending them off to the second part of the movie.<br />But before he does, there's the little matter of Private Gomer Pyle.  Vincent D'Onofrio, a normally brawny actor, pulled a DeNiro adding 70 pounds for his role as the pudgy, dim-witted Pyle.  D'Onofrio pulls off a dual role here.  At times he's an object of ridicule (one scene has him lagging behind the rest of his platoon, as punishment, with his pants down around his ankles and his thumb stuck in his mouth), wearing an ignorant goofy grin even during the most perilous moments.  But as the act wears on, D'Onofrio does a wicked slow burn.  A menacing leer finds its way to his face.  The denouement bursts with psychotic energy, but it doesn't stretch out the drama,as other similar scenes have been wont to do.  It's probably the only moment in my experience watching Kubrick where he goes for the economic approach.  Bravo, because it's a killer moment that defines what follows in its wake.<br />And what follows is harrowing.  Gone are the clean and pristine shots of the army barracks, and the perfect symmetry of the men lined up in front of their footlockers.  These scenes, filmed lovingly by cinematographer Douglas Milsome, make way for a more rugged and dirty movie, one less concerned with the rigid order of training, and more aware of the disorder that is warfare.  The images become grainy, washed-out, and a little wild.  Just like the men.<br />The main link between the two sections is Matthew Modine's Private Joker.  So named for a wisecrack on the first day of training, Joker could have become your standard wise guy character, seen in countless war films.  But instead, he's the conduit through which the audience experiences the movie.  He's a one man Greek chorus, utilizing his position as \\"combat correspondent\\" for 'Stars and Stripes' to offer patriotic coverage and liberal commentary on the war effort.  Joker is best exemplified by the inherent contradiction between the slogan he's written on his helmet (\\"Born to Kill\\") and the peace symbol he wears on his fatigues.  When confronted by a Colonel about the apparent hypocrisy of such a semiotic statement, Joker blithely replies that he's trying to show the \\"duality of man... the Jungian thing.\\"  Modine, whose later career became marked by the flippancy but not the weight of Joker, here, in his first major role, gets the complexities of the man just right.<br />We follow Joker, and the men he encounters, through the surprise Tet Offensive, and then into a scene where they must find a sniper in the ghost town that was once Hue City.  These sequences show just how far the men from basic training have come.  What started out as raw recruits, soft and civil, become nihilisticand rugged he-men.  They truly have turned into the killing machines that Sgt. Hartman promised they'd be.  Kubrick never lets them be anything else, as he bombards his men from all sides with bombing and gunfire.  The Tet scenes find Joker hooking up with a ramshackle group of Marines hell bent on hellfire, and they're wondrous and frightening.  The sniper scenes, which carry a quieter mood, pit the platoon against one person instead of the entire NVA.  But the danger of being picked off at any moment is tangible.  The fear, which underlies the gung-ho nature of the marines, is palpable in every one of these moments.<br />The movie, written by Kubrick along with Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford, doesn't feel like other war movies, even though it too is concerned with the machismo inherent in every fighting man.  The story here comes across like a literate piece of stage drama.  The dialogue spoken by the marines, taking their cue from Ermey's drill sergeant no doubt, is harsh, vibrant, and colourful.  Much of it can't be reprinted here (what can is bleakly hilarious: \\"I wanted to see exotic Vietnam, the jewel of Southeast Asia. I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture... and kill them,\\" deadpans Joker when asked why he serves), but it became one of my greatest joys in discovering how original and profound and credible the screenplay for this movie was.<br />\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is one of Kubrick's more taut movies.  There are no moments of slow contemplation or long scenes of dramatic tightening.  Things move at a quick pace, are often tempered with the deepest black humour, and are never anything less than visceral.  It's a stunning emotional achievement from a director whom I've always accused of being too detached.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I don't know.  \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is basically well-conceived.  There are some insane performances.  Cinematography rocks.  But I really wasn't blown away by it.  I was unnerved by it, and that is most definitely what Aronofsky was shooting for, and therefore it's a successful film, but I'm not putting it on My List.  Maybe \\"Pi\\" - maybe - but not this.  This movie just seems kind of unnecessary.  Did we really need another drug-glam-death movie?  Its images are appropriately revolting: the brain-splattered face of a fugitive Marlon Wayans, the gangrenous injection site of a smacked-out Jared Leto, the krypt-keeper complexion of a detoxing Ellen Burstyn, etc.  She deserves some props for being able to let go like that, by the way.  And cinematographically we are made to empathize with her the most.  We get more from her POV under the influence of crazy diet pills, with the trails and sound-distortions, than we do when Jared and Jennifer slam coke or heroin and we watch them in 3rd-person as they buzz around the room or gush sickening dope-tripe to each other.  But none of it is necessary.  I've seen this before - all of it.  It's done exceptionally well here, and that probably should be enough, and maybe it will be in the long run.  Or maybe Aronofsky just raised the bar too high with \\"Pi\\" to chase it with an exceptional treatment of a run-of-the-mill story.  I mean, we all know what's gonna go down here.  Naive old lady, slightly wild young kids.  Drugs.  Old lady starts popping pills prescribed by shifty physician cuz she thinks she's going on TV and she wants to be able to fit into her red dress and feel like a worthwhile person.  Young kids start chipping on C&H cuz they deal it, cuz they're trying to get out of Coney, and how do they know how much to cut if they don't sample the wares.  The ironic thing is that they are all fundamentally well-intentioned.  <br />They're doomed.<br />It's way more brutal than any War On Drugs campaign I've ever seen (except that really sickening \\"I fund terrorism\\" one), but the \\"message\\" is essentially identical, even though this film seems to speak from first-hand experience with substance abuse.  Stylistically it excels.  It's extremely depressing.  My arm literally started hurting when I watched it.  It's grim and unflinching and unconsoling.  It doesn't really suggest that anybody should've or could've done anything differently - this is just what happens.<br />Like I said at first, I don't know.  My reaction is probably more emotional than anything: the film is effective, but I don't want to put myself through watching it again.  All I can really get out of it in the end is \\"don't do drugs\\" or at best \\"if you do drugs you're playing with fire.\\"  <br />I will admit one thing though - the \\"infomercial\\" menu did screw me up.  I thought I still had the TV on, I didn't even bother to read the flashing text, I just visually revolted and wondered why I couldn't change channels.  haha<br />P.S.  I wrote this before I had read any of the reviews.  Strangely I am for once in agreement with most of them.
B000065U1N|5.0|I don't even like Tony Scott usually. Most of his movies are very hollywood and unrealistic. Sometimes he's got something good going but he's got to do something idiotic or have a line in it that makes you feel like your in middle school.<br />This movie was different. It was by far his most realistic war movie, and probably one of the best war flicks I've seen in awhile. It's as good as Platoon, or Full Metal Jacket, etc. I wouldn't have put Tom Seizmore in this, he was good in Saving Private Ryan, but he looks more like a mafia gangster than a modern day solider, in my opinion. I will say though that he did good in it. This was so much better than most war shows. Most usually give one line comedy punch lines and the soldiers usually are the size of professional wrestlers. In real life this just isn't so. I might even go so far to say this is Scott's best movie. He did some good stuff in the past BUT I like realistic stuff. I'm not into to Sci-Fi. This is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile.<br />It also shows a very clear message towards where we are now, and what we were then as a country. There's FAR too much \\"tolerance,\\" regardless of whose in office. It's been ten years since this nearly and we still act the same. Our war policy shows weakness in every form, and this event proves it to the letter.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think Avril Lavigne is kick[rear] without a doubt. I think she could completely take over and knock Britney Spears out. I think once things start getting old like Britney you need something new catchy and great, thats exactly what Avril has done. I think her music is silly but serious and her songs are all ovbiously something she has experienced which makes her even more awesome to write stuff she knows about rather than all this mushy [junk] out there about just unbelievably dumb stuff. Now all i have to say now is if you havent gotten her CD i suggest you go get it it is worth every cent. There isnt one song you wont like . I cant seem to put the CD down. I even made a copy for my mom to listen in her car. She loves Avril too. So if this doesnt convince you to get her CD i dont know what will. GO AVRIL!!...

B00003CXTG|1.0|With the exception of the digital effects that created the Ca. class battle ships this movie his pure hokum... watch Tora Tora Tora... and if your into naval accuracy get Windtalkers when it comes out on DVD. Too much needless gore but they got the right classifications of ships and the correct Destroyer Squadron that attacked Saipan... at least they did their homework.
B000002OTL|4.0|I absolutely love the music from \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" Many of the songs feel so integral to the scenes, such as Bruce Willis singing along to \\"Flowers on the Wall,\\" just before he runs into the very man he desperately needs to avoid. Hearing Dick Dale's surf-music theme \\"Misirlou\\" puts me instantly in the mood to see the movie again, no matter how recently I just watched it.  Urge Overkill's rendition of \\"Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon\\" was phenomenally paired with Uma Thurman's experiments with John Travolta's heroin.<br />But as much as I love the movie and the music, this collection leaves something to be desired. The \\"Pulp Fiction\\" soundtrack contains an interesting mix of lots of fun songs, and is fun to listen to. I would give the collection of music 5 stars, and the organization of the CD (discussed below) 1 star--hence my 4-star compromise.<br />My biggest objection is that the dialogue snippets just interrupt the flow of the CD. And some of the dialogue selections, in my book, aren't even the most memorable exchanges in the movie. For instance, instead of giving us Samuel L. Jackson's wonderful \\"Say 'WHAT?' again\\" exchange before blasting his victim, we get the Jack Rabbit Slim's rather inane dance competition introduction. The Royale with Cheese and the discussion about eating pork work fine. The \\"Zed's Dead, Baby\\" discussion, while enjoyable in the movie, doesn't work as well when cut out of context. In reality, if the producers of the soundtrack wanted to include movie dialogue, they could have included the Ezekiel quote at the beginning on the soundtrack, and then left off the rest.<br />Don't get me wrong. I have enjoyed ways that other soundtracks departed from being a strictly musical experience. Emma Thompson's reading of \\"Sigh No More\\" on the \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" soundtrack really sets the tone for the soundtrack, and coming at the beginning of the CD, does not detract from the music.<br />My other dislike about the soundtrack is that the songs do notappear in the same sequence as in the movie. They aren't chronological for the \\"true\\" order of events (as opposed to the sequence-switching that Tarantino did). For me, a movie soundtrack should be a mini experience of the movie. The songs on the soundtrack appear in no discernable order. The organization does not even work aesthetically.<br />If you have a CD player that enables programming your preferences for a particular CD, however, all of these objections could be resolved. You could omit the excess dialogue and re-order the music in a more appealing sequence.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD combines many different elements of music, including rap and rock. From the day I heard about Linkin Park and listened to their music, I knew they would become popular in people's eyes. They music is so lyrical and they dont sing about [junk], they sing about life and the troubles in life. Chester's voice is just amazing, and works perfectly with Mike's rap voice...perfect combo! Give credit to the awesome music by the band musicians! (Below are the song ratings, in my opinion..)<br />1.)PaperCut..(A)-This song brings Chester's and Mike's voice together the the awesome first song. Upbeat, and the chorus is real catchy. The second half of the song is incredible. One of the best songs on the CD..<br />2.)One Step Closer...(B)-This is more of a \\"punk\\" song than rock or rap. Chester sings most of it, but Mike adds some in the chorus. <br />3.)With You....(B-)-Pretty good, although I didn't enjoy it as much as the others, but I didn't find myself skipping it..<br />4.)Points of Authority...(A-)-Real good rap entrance by Mike, followed by real rhythmic Chester. Chorus alittle cheesy, but not bad.<br />5.)Crawling.....(A)-Everyone knows thos song. Real catchy chorus, and good singing by Chester..One of the best songs on the CD<br />6.)Runaway.....(B)-Real good chorus, and the lyrics are great.<br />7.)By Myself....(B-)-To be honest I heard this only a couple of times, but I didn't really enjoy it, but it wasnt bad.<br />8.)In the End....(A)-Now for sure everyone knows this song, probably the most known off the whole track, Mike and Chester combine to make it awesome..one of the bests.<br />9.)A Place for my Head...(A)-Really nice intro, that doesn't really sound \\"Linkin Park Like\\" but awesome Pre-Chorus, and Chorus..<br />10.)Forgotten...(A)-One of the best songs for sure...I love the chorus, as well as the bridge after the chorus, another mixture of voices. Awesome.<br />11.)Cure for the Itch....(C+)-I'm not saying this is bad, I think it's awesome guitaring and dj'ing but I am more into the singing rather the dj..no offense to LP's band, they're great<br />12.)Pushing me Away....(A)-Chester really shows off his voice in this one. Alittle more quieter, awesome catchy chorus, great song to end the album!<br />Now you can see how big of a LP fan I am! Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is definetly worth the money, and although some tracks sound similar it's still one of those albums where you don't find yourself skipping songs!
B000065U1N|5.0|On October 3, 1993 American Rangers, Delta Force members and aviators engaged in a running gun battle with Somali militiamen over the period of 16 hours.  When all was said and done, 19 Americans and at least 1000 Somali's were dead.  It was the bloodiest day for American infantry since Vietnam, a period that encompassed Grenada, Panama, and the Gulf War.<br />\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is director Ridley Scott's adaptation of Mark Bowden's incredible chronicle of that day's events.  In my opinion, he has created a remarkable film, and a powerful tribute to those who lost their lives.  In fact, in terms of the shear power of his portrayal of combat, I would have to argue that this might be the greatest war film ever made.<br />There are those who say that this film is lacking in character development, that it doesn't tell a story or offer a big picture view of what happened.  They miss the point.  Scott's purpose was to portray the brutality and terror of combat in the most realistic way possible, and he succeeded.  The only character development that matters is that which appears under fire, and the big picture story is irrelevant to the viewer because it was irrelevant to the American soldiers who were fighting for their lives against an entire city.  Likewise, some accuracy was sacrificed in order to facilitate the telling of the story within the confines of a two-hour movie.  Some events and people are merged; others are eliminated entirely.  If you are interested in the \\"big picture\\" I would strongly recommend reading the book prior to the movie, as it will offer insight and depth into what is happening on the screen.<br />And there is quite a bit happening; Scott filmed \\"Black Hawk Down\\" with the fill support and backing of the Army, and it shows.  No matter how good CGI has become, it can't compare to an actual Blackhawk (my one pet peeve about the book and the movie is that \\"Black Hawk\\" should be one word) helicopter.  Likewise, the representation of the soldiers' gear is largely dead-on, with the discrepancies largely due to an effort to minimize confusion among viewers unfamiliar with military operations.  Also, the cinematography is spectacular.  Scott used a host of different angles, as well as dismounted cameras to as closely as possible replicate the chaos of combat.  At the same time, the cameras seem to have been left unfiltered and the result is a bright, gritty, incredibly realistic look.<br />The acting was likewise superb; while there was no \\"lead actor\\" per se, there wasn't a single bad performance out of a group that included at least 20 people with significant lines.  In particular, Tom Sizemore proved himself to be one of the best character actors around today.  He'll never be a great leading man, but he is an incredible presence on screen nonetheless.<br />Unfortunately, this remarkable performance and the men it honors have been let down by a terrible DVD.  While the sound and picture are fine, the extras are a joke.  There's a making of documentary that is all right in and of itself, but that's it.  The original theatrical trailers weren't even included, and there was an excellent History Channel documentary that should have been added.  No director's commentary, no actor interviews; I'm sure there'll be a \\"Special Edition\\" in a few months, I would recommend renting this movie until that comes out because this edition left me feeling distinctly ripped off.<br />Still, that shouldn't detract from this fantastic movie.  It is a raw, graphic, disturbing, and profoundly moving portrait of the heroes who defend our country every day.  This isn't a movie for the faint of heart, and even those of us who are hard to touch may shed a tear.  That said, it is both an important movie, and an extremely well shot one.  All emotion and gripes about the DVD aside, it is not a movie that should be passed on.
B00005UEAR|5.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, this really feels like two albums in one, with the first side containing a more heavy, experimental style and the second with a more traditional DT sound.  The first disk incorporates a number of new sound effects and Petrucci's riffs are very hard and almost grungy.  There is a great deal of soloing, with the members displaying amazing musicianship.  The bass lines on &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; are some of the best I've heard in a long time and Jordan Rudess really makes an impact with his mastery at the keyboard throughout the disk.  I didn't like James Labrie's singing as much as on &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot; but the lyrics have improved a bit.  Disc 2 is the 42 minute epic title track which is, quite frankly, amazing.  I won't go any further than that here, you'll just have to listen to it for yourself.  <br />Even though I don't like this album quite as much as Scenes From a Memory (which I regard as DT's ultimate masterpiece), I think it is definitely worth the buy.  In a world of MTV/rock/rap/pop, Dream Theater is a great relief.
B000031XCR|5.0|Celine Dion has one of the greatest voices of all time. This album is a collection of her &quot;greatest hits&quot;, except Celine Dion has more class, so she doesn't call it that. <BR>&quot;Power of Love&quot; is a great &quot;intro&quot; song. It is a beautiful ballad. Although Celine's voice screeches a bit, it is a song worth listening to. I love the line 'The feeling that I can't go on is light years away.' &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; is a 2 star song, not that great, not that stupid. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is a good song. It is a combo of two beautiful voices: Peabo Bryson and Celine Dion. &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; is one of Celine Dion's best songs. Many people, even if not Celine fans, like this song. &quot;It's All Coming Back to Me&quot; is a great song, one of my favorites on this CD. It is very upbeat. &quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot; is definitely not Celine's style. &quot;To Love You More&quot; is SUCH a beautiful song. Like &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, many people like this song even if not Celine Dion fans. It has a beautiful violin. &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; is probably Celine's best song ever. Even people who HATE Celine LOVE this song. I know from experience. &quot;I'm Your Angel&quot; is a wonderful duet with R. Kelly. Sometimes &quot;I'm Your Angel&quot; makes me cry. &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot; is a great song. It has a great beat. I am not especially fond of &quot;If Walls Could Talk.&quot; &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; is a nice, slow song, but I usually do not listen to the whole thing. &quot;All the Way&quot; is a wonderful song, but I doubt Celine REALLY recorded it with Frank Sinatra becuase he wouldv'e been dead in 1999, when Celine did this album. I think she recorded onto Frank Sinatra's original version of the song. &quot;Then You Look at Me&quot; is an OK song. Towards the end of the album, the songs get worse, but &quot;I Want You to Need Me&quot; is an exception. &quot;Live for the One I Love&quot; is another of those slow songs and goes in the same catagory as &quot;Then You Look at Me&quot;, &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and many of the other songs at the end: slow, boring songs. <BR>There, I'm finished with my essay.<BR>I hope this inspires you to buy CD's CD!
B000007WRN|5.0|Madonna's 1998 album RAY OF LIGHT was a rebirth in many forms. It had been 4 years since we heard a real studio album from Madonna, 1994's BEDTIME STORIES, before was 1992's EROTICA, so as usual people didn't know what to expect from Madonna. She surprised us all, by returning with this album, RAY OF LIGHT, which is one of her best albums. <br />The album is totally electronica, working with William Orbit she created this sound, which works extremely well here. Since 1994, there had been lots of changes in Madonna. She released the ballads compilation SOMETHING TO REMEMBER in 1995, took the world by storm with her role in EVITA in 1996, and also had a child in 1996, which obviously changed her profusely. As well it appears she found religion in hinduism. All of these changes are brought to light here. She talks about the joys of motherhood on the poignantly beautiful \\"Little Star\\", she deals with the death of her mother on the hauntingly beautiful \\"Mer Girl\\", she tells it like it is on \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\", about replenishing and renewal on \\"Swim\\", love and acceptance on \\"Nothing Really Matters\\", a sense of longing on \\"Has To Be\\". <br />Overall its a complete album start to finish, fans arent/wont be disapointed with this one. The import is worth it for the extra track \\"Has To Be\\", which was a bside, its a great track. Overall this is worth checking out, so give it a try.
B00005NWRS|5.0|&quot;Gold&quot;, by Ryan Adams, was chosen as the best album of 2001 by the British music magazine &quot;Uncut&quot;; they were right on the money.The lead-off track ,&quot;New York New York&quot;, was written before the September 11 tragedy, but became an ode to the city afterwords; it is a strong start for the album.           &quot;Firecracker&quot; is a rocker that will blow your mind.                       &quot;La Cienga Just Smiled&quot; is a surprisingly touching ballad. &quot;Rescue Blues&quot; is blues-rock song that will grab you from the first listen. &quot;Nobody Girl&quot;, one of my favorite songs on the album, starts out slow and gradually builds into a top-notch rock ballad that runs nearly ten minutes long.It seems to be about a break-up; it stays with you after hearing it.Things take a folky turn on &quot;When the Stars go Blue&quot;, a lovely ballad that was recently remade by the Corrs, with Bono contributing vocals.        Adams can rock with the best of them on &quot;Tina Toledo&quot;s Streetwalkin' Blues&quot;.The only low point is &quot;Syvia Plath&quot;, which I found to be dreary. Otherwise, every song on the album is excellent.A limited-edition with a bonus disc (Cleverly entitiled &quot;Side 4&quot;) has 5 more great songs.Like Pete Yorn, Ryan Adams is a promising new talent to watch.
0679736646|5.0|With UBIK, Dick wrote a book which is, in the same time, extremely pleasant to read and extremely confusing - quite a feat...<br />UBIK is a \\"best of\\" Dick's obsessions: it contains obvious reminiscences of The Eye in the Sky (the collective nightmare), The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (the greedy, almighty, elusive son of a b...), Counter-clock world (time running backwards), The World Jones Made (precognition), Time Out of Joint (the fake world), to name a few. In a way, it is also reminiscent of VALIS (the Godlike entity which communicates with the hero by mystical means), which was written 12 years after UBIK!<br />How could so many themes be exploited so intelligently in such a short novel? The answer is: thanks to Dick's straightforward style. In UBIK, every word counts. The hero, Joe Chip, races with Death: each passing minute lowers his chances to find a UBIK vaporizer and to save his skin. Through Dick's sparing use of words, the reader understands this message: if Joe Chip rests, he will die. Some of Dick's despisers criticize his so-called \\"hasty\\" style: can't they see that, thanks to this style, he could describe the undescribable? When you get rid of the superfluous, you get a chance to grab the true essence of horror. At least, that's what Dick thought; I personnally think he was right and that he should be remebered of today not only for his hallucinatory visions but also for his style.<br />The style allows Dick to exploit the above themes \\"intelligently\\", ie in depth and by intertwinig them. But it will probably not allow the reader to fully understand the book after the first reading, unless he's VERY familiar with Dick's tricks, mainly the different levels of reality. One of my friends, who is an experienced sci-fi reader (but not a Dick's reader), still can't understand the last few lines of UBIK, where Runciter finds a Joe Chip coin in his pocket. She asked me, and I said: \\"I think you should re-read the book entirely.\\" I all the less recommend UBIK to people who don't usually read sci-fi: insofar as the style is pleasant, and the basic cat-and-mouse story catching, they may 1) have a superficial reading of it, ie think that it works only on one level (as an \\"adventure\\" novel, like, for instance, Solar Lottery); 2) thus, read 90 per cent of it and think they have understood it all; 3) be completely bewildered by the last 10 per cent and make the conclusion that all the book is a piece of nonsense.<br />At the end of his life, Dick said in an interview that he was not very satisfied with UBIK: he felt that with this novel, he started to repeat himself. That is absolutely true. There is nothing new in UBIK - Dick only picked up the best of his previous books, confronted for the first time his obsessions one with another, and tried to examine whether the whole could be superior to the sum of its parts. It was like playing poker, canasta, baccara and gin rummy with the same deck of cards. The result is convincing.
B000021XS0|5.0|Imagine 5 people, who are the most talented individuals at their respective instruments, coming together at the prime of their careers to create an amazing concept album in a great creative burst.  This is what you get with Scenes From a Memory.  Dream Theater adds the perfect mix of heavenly vocals, heavy guitar riffs, fast and technical solos, brilliant keyboarding skills, and killer bass lines.  I won't break it down song by song, as others have surely already done since there are many other reviews.  This is Dream Theater's best and biggest breakthrough album of their careers.  All Prog rock/metal fans must own it.
B00005JKNF|2.0|I am sick to my stomach of hearing how \\"this is Altman's finest work\\" and \\"it should have won Best Picture\\" and so on. Altman's finest work?? He hasn't HAD any fine work! He was a one-hit-wonder with \\"THE PLAYER\\" but all of his other films were terrible.<br /><br />But I'm not prejudice to Robert Altman films. I gave this one a chance. It has no characters I care about, an ending that just seems like they ran out of money so they had to stop, and a plot shamelessly ripped off of the far superior \\"CLUE\\". The story involves a huge group of people going to a large country mansion for a shooting party. One of them is a producer for the 30's and 40's \\"Charlie Chan\\" mystery films, who's next film \\"CHARLIE CHAN IN LONDON\\" begins to mysteriously come to life as one of the guests is both poisioned and stabbed.<br />So, whodunnit? Well, we don't exactly find out, so it doesn't particularly matter who did it.<br />Another thing I don't like about this movie is all the meaningless scenes. The film could have been cut down to an hour and a half if they could have spared ten or twenty meaningless conversations like \\"This tea is cold, could I have another one...? No! Not in that glass! You're not even Scottish!\\"<br />Not to mention that in \\"CLUE\\", you couldn't tell if the killer was male or female, leaving us guessing. But in \\"GOSFORD PARK\\", we not only see that the killer is a man, but that he's also wearing pen-striped pants! A trait that only belongs to one person in the whole movie!!!<br />In closing, if you're intrested in the way Europeans lived their lives during the 30's, or would like to see nice scenery (which this film does have quite a bit of), go out and see this film. However, if you want a good murder mystery flick, do yourself a favor and just watch \\"CLUE\\".
6304383827|3.0|I haven't seen other versions of this Austen book, so I can't compare...but I found Paltrow's EMMA an enjoyable way to lose two hours on a Sunday afternoon.  The scenery was nice, the acting adequate, and the costuming great.
0316666343|5.0|This book is incredible.  I enjoyed it greatly.  This is definently one of my favorite books.  I couldn't put it down.  You're thrown into someone elses mind, becoming wildly entertained, interested, and on the edge of your seat.  The book is intense and the writing style unique.  THis book reaches many different people on different levels.  I highly recommend reading it.
B00003Q43A|1.0|How this movie merited a special edition is beyond my understanding.  I can't even describe how bad this movie is, so I won't even try.  Watch it and judge it by yourself.  Who knows, maybe some folks enjoy this kind of slop.  They must... it made money.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|What an absolute EXCELLENT movie in every sense of the word. I've never seen Russell Crowe perform as powerfully as he did in this film. I'd heard this was a good movie, but when I saw it, I didn't much know what it was about. I think mental illness is something we don't think about much, unless it affects us or someone close to us. This is an amazing story of one man's experience with mental illness --- a very real (and inescapable) presence in his life despite his genious. He is sheltered and supported by the love of an AMAZING wife as he learns to cope with how his illness has devastated his life and his dreams.  It's not a &quot;mushy&quot; film, so don't be afraid to watch it on that basis.  It's very real and touching, but it doesn't &quot;gush&quot; and I appreciated that.  This is a movie that can educate you, entertain you, make you feel compassion for those with mental illness. If you take it for what it's worth, it may even mature you.  I highly recommend it.
0553296981|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone, but particularly to young girls (and, for that matter, young boys, I suppose).  It paints a picture of life during the Holocaust through the eyes of someone with the same hopes, fears, questions, etc., as any kid might be having, and therefore it'll be easier for kids to see Anne as a real human being.<br />Anne worries about her appearance and wonders whether she'll fall in love; she both loves and fights with her parents; and she wouldn't mind in the least if her Algebra book happened to somehow disappear in the middle of the night.  Most kids will be able to relate to most of that, and will probably find it more interesting than they will a text book account of the Holocaust.
B000067DNC|5.0|I can not WAIT for this box set to be released. I have the first season boxed set and I LOVE it. Richard Dean Anderson is SOOOOO funny; Teal'C is the perfect opposite to Col. O'Neill's goofiness. I can not wait for the 3rd season boxed set to be released; I know I am jumping the gun but hey no one said I was ever patient. Ya Sure you betcha!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|So far this goes down as my worst DVD purchase of all time. It's a mishmash of bad 70's music performed terribly. The story line, if you can call it that, is terrible. Its got bad acting to boot. Blech! you'll find my copy for sale on Ebay.
0792843584|3.0|What's most dismaying about this much-maligned epic disaster is how much of the 219 minute version is actually quite good. Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is stunningly beautiful, David Mansfield's score is wonderfully evocative, and the sheer scale of some of the sequences is absolutely breathtaking. So it's a pity that the sound mix is so bad we can't hear most of the dialogue in crucial scenes, and that the script is so dire that it probably wouldn't help if we could. Key questions which most films answer (ostensibly, at least) in the first thirty minutes - Who are these people? What are their relationships? What do they want? - are left largely unaddressed. The audience is left floundering among admittedly beautiful set-pieces which make little sense, and overlong scenes which add nothing to a story we can't understand. It's a shame, because there is the essence of a great story here: starving immigrant landholders legally exterminated by ruthless cattle barons, and the idealistic minority who try to prevent their slaughter. That's dramatic; that's exciting; that's full of the necessary conflict. But in Cimino's hands - as a writer at least - it becomes directionless, obscure and, with the exception of one or two bloodthirsty shoot-outs, relentlessly dull. With a few new expository scenes, a cleaned-up sound mix, and some ruthless editing, this would have been a decent film. One day, some audacious team of filmmakers is going to tackle this story again. But only when 'Heaven's Gate' is long forgotten, and - if the public reaction in 1980 is any indication - when American audiences are ready to face up to the moral ambiguity which lies at the heart of so much of their history.
B00005YU1O|5.0|The movie is without a doubt the most amazing piece of cinema made in period. The insane animation is only matched by the depth of the point the movie trying to portray. Its a story about whats real whats in the mind and everything in between. Not to mention this movies imagery and story matter will make you feel like your on drugs. But don't let that deter you, this movie really is the stuff that dreams are made of.
B00005T343|1.0|I saw Silence of The Lambs and loved it. So...I was looking forward to Hannibal. Big mistake!<br />Hannibal COULD have been another great film, but for the most discusting, tasteless (pardon the pun), nauseating scenes I've ever witnessed. <br />What was Hollywood thinking! It appeares to me that every effort was made to shock and abhor the audiences. I could not eat for a long time after witnessing this discusting piece of so-called \\"entertainment\\". If this is what Hollywood and the American people consider entertainment, then I would like to resign my membership! <br />Anthony Hopkins really disappointed me by lowering himself to even consider having anything to do with such a movie! I have always been a big fan of is and will continue to be, but this was shocking and diappointing. <br />On the other hand I must applaud  Jodie Foster for refusing to appear in Hannibal. I imagine her reasons were due to the graphic gore. Jodie has VERY GOOD TASTE! Much better, I'm afraid, than Mr. Hopkins. <br />This is not a film I would recommend to anyone. <br />Thank you.<BR>Alice B. Kane
B00003CXXS|1.0|but not by much. at least the dinosaurs look cool.<BR>best viewed while the sound is turned off so you're not<BR>distracted by the dialogue.
0780631684|4.0|This could have been just another gormless teen flick if it wasn't for the delightfully wicked premise and the obvious relish with which writer Glen Morgan and director James Wong exploit its potential. The air disaster which kicks off the story is only the first of many major shocks which will have you squirming till the end. The mainly teen cast acquit themselves well, striking the perfect balance between horror and disbelief.  This is stylish, frightening fun which will leave you wishing Morgan and Wong had longer resum&eacute;s.
B0000033PB|4.0|It's not a bad album.  It doesn't rock like Brain Salad Surgery, but at the same time I think it qualifies as a<BR>more sophisticated sound for ELP.  They still play well together, and as usual I would say that their sound here<BR>would be regarded by many as being progressive.  If you're<BR>a big Keith Emerson fan there's something here, and likewise if you're a big Greg Lake fan there's something here as well.  Palmer as usual does his own thing like no other drummer can.  I really like the lyrics for 'Paper Blood' and 'Black Moon', and what Emerson does with 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' is fun to listen to.
B000021YQV|1.0|Some people say System is one of the most talented, intelligent, socially aware bands of the century. They combine scorching music with powerful and deep lyrics to create a sound all their own in the music industry. Obviously these people are either deaf, musically inept, or punk fans. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some crazed Yanni-ite who thinks you should give peace a chance, I enjoy my share of harder music. But I prefer mine from people that can A: play bass B: play drums C: sing...oh GOD please someone who can sing. I mean, how can you call a band talented if the singer cant hold a note longer then 3 seconds without his voice cracking? You are the kind of people that must think Macy Gray's voice is &quot;unique&quot;. What I also don't understand is how people can think that singing about eating seeds and quoting the bible is somehow creative lyrics. If you want lyrics that don't make any sense, listen to Weird Al or something, at least he has a decent band behind him. Anywho, if you want to just release some aggression and listen to some people play their instruments loud and yell about things that just don't matter, might I suggest some bands that are better at it such as VOD (Vision of Disorder), Zao, and Mudvayne. On the other hand, if listening to people that you KNOW for a FACT shouldn't get 1/54ths of the radio play they do bugs the bejezzus out of you, don't support this sorry excuse for a band. As someone who lives in LA, they embarrass me, and I assure you they embarrass others. But hey, &quot;To each his own&quot;, but I truley hope their &quot;fans&quot; try to listen to some good music, and not subject themselves to listening to this pitiful excuse for a band, and then try to justify it by giving the songs meaning they never had nor never will.
B000002R67|4.0|Lately, I've used this album to explain to some of my younger<BR>friends what the times were like when I was young. The album just<BR>speaks to me.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book in two days.  It was great. I couldn't put it down.  There were some parts in the middle I felt that dragged a little.  But you wanted to continue reading to find out what happens next.  What I most got out of the book, that we are not alone, that our dead loved ones talk to us all the time......we just need to listen.  This book was a little bit of a mystery too.  Who was the killer going to kill next?  The story talks about how everyone deals with Susie's death.  And Susie sits up in heaven looking down on Earth at everthing that is going on with her friends and family.  The ending was the best part of the book.  And with that I'll leave you to run out and get your own copy to read.  I can't wait to see what Alice Sebold comes up with next.  Great reading.....
6304139519|4.0|Jumanji is an excellent film. There is enough action to keep one's attention, and a great combination of suspense and comedy with some great acting by Robin Williams. It can be a little scary for younger children, because of the constant danger the children are in throughout the movie, but it was one I have watched several times and never get tired of it.
B00005YUNY|2.0|I found the DVD to be borderline good. The audio wasnt as good as others claimed it was. My sub woofer almost never came on. Jon Anderson has become so boring.
B00003CXWV|2.0|A good film to watch when you think your life is messed up.
0440416027|4.0|Skellig is an interesting book. If you're used to characters that are really engaging, this book only has one, and it's not the main character. It's the atmosphere of this book that helps elevate it to a four star review. It feels surreal, and perhaps this is why the main character left me disappointed (a bit mind you) in his personality. He seems to be drifting along, and skellig is the anchor that helps him from drifting away from things. His infant sister is in ill health, and when he discovers skellig, a little magic is introduced to his life, as is a way to bond with a peculiar, home schooled, neighbor girl. I shouldn't be so heavy handed with the main character's lack of vitality, because I think he's supposed to be one you can easily put yourself in, and in a book as spiritual as skellig, that's what is needed. Give it a shot if you think nature is...mysterious.
B000066NW0|5.0|let me just give u the point. ItS InCrEdIbLe! when i bought cds, i only owuld like a few songs on it right. but i love all the songs on this cd! the lyrics have meaning not like britney spears. she just tells everyone the truth about her love life because she needed to \\"Let Go\\" i need to do that someday. :D well if u love country, rock, hip hop, or just plain clasical cool music, youll REGRET not buying this great cd.

B00005YUNY|5.0|As a true Yes fan, this DVD is a musical experience that just cannot be missed. Are our maestros flawless? No. But then, we have come to understand that Yes pioneered the epic musical formula that married classical with rock music. It is their writing ability that sets them apart from any other rock group. To take a simple melody, such as the one that comes from their signature piece 'Close To The Edge' and develop several movements is nothing less than pure musical genius. The production, camera work and sound quality is superb indeed. And the orchestra enhanced the music to a new and refreshing level of listening pleasure. The songs that most benefited from the orchestral arrangements are 'Close To The Edge', 'Ritual', 'Gates of Delerium', and 'And You and I'. These works are treasures that have been preserved for us fans for all time. Yea!! The &quot;Magnification' material is fine, but it's obvious to any Yes fan that this material falls short of the early Yes greats anyway. The orchestra was transparent in 'I've Seen All Good People' but added a nice touch in 'Starship Trooper' and 'Long Distance Runaround'. Alan's percussion performance is simply awesome as so is his exhuberant performance. Steve's performance was great. But we all, have seen him dumb down his guitar licks through the years. Chris's enthusiasm always adds to the frontmen the most aggresive playing while always giving us what we want, that stylish ricky sound. Their vocal performance was excellent and if we want to be totally honest, Tom on keys did a fantastic job. Sure we would of loved to have seen Rick there, but close your eyes and you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. 'Ritual' is a songwriting accomplishment that worked  best with the orchestra. The lyric and progressive melody are simply beautiful when backdroped against the warm colors of the symphony and then transitioning to an all out percussive fest. All in all, the entire concert is a splendid blending of orchestral rock themes that make this perhaps one of Yes' greatest concerts on video to date.
B00000K2UX|4.0|The movie is great and the soundtrack is great, but the recording quality was much lower than expected. The highs are thin (saturated?) and the lows are muddied. It sounds like it was recorded to sound &quot;good&quot; on most peoples (low quality) car radios of the time. With better systems (which includes most cars today, not to mention high-end systems like mine), it sounds thin. The movie is in my top-ten, but the soundtrack is not.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|well not being any kind of film critic .i had to give this movie a review .only for the horror of it all..<br />  requiem for a dream is a potrait of everday life.taking the watcher down the darkest part of dreams and hope .<br /> it starts with four doomed souls and there journey into what you would expect from there  nightmares .but it seems that they all got what they wanted from there greatest dreams..<br /> seeing this movie is something better than i could do to explain it.there is so much to see and hear.  but i can say it was hard to watch at times and i even found myself closeing my eyes at times from the sheer terror of these images and the horror of these peoples realities. so to put in in my simplest opinon .if you are looking for something to watch that will make you fell better about your life after!! this is one to get.it will make you appreciate your little dreams you have that might be hopeful and optimistic..
B00006690F|5.0|I really bought this cd because his other cd's made me laugh.... and think about what he was saying. New beats, singing, Unlyrical Lyrics. It's all here and more. Even though he is still full of anger and frustration, he sure is \\"in tune\\" with his feelings and i like that.  So who isn't frustrated these days? Sure feels good to know you're not alone.  As for him dissing people, it's just funny because the whole world is one big gossip column anyways. He's not stupid cause he knows what ever he says is gonna make people mad and cause a big fuss, eventually giving him more publicity than he can stand.  His wicked rymes in this cd has captured me once again. This is his BEST cd and still offensive but just with some different targets like the government (Tipper Gore, Ms. Cheney) What he says is so TRUE that it offends only the hypocrites!!! Ha Ha Ha. I LOVE IT
B00005JKNF|3.0|Robert Altman must have woke up one morning and turned the tv to public television. On the tv there may have been a little show known as \\"Mystery\\" or \\"Poirot\\". As he sat there staring into the tube, enjoying the show, he probably said something like this: \\"I wanna make one of those.\\" And thus, \\"Gosford Park\\" was born.<br />Of course there were other inspirations for Gosford Park, probably an entire list of them, but it felt like a late night episode of \\"Father Cadfiel\\". Not that that's bad, but if a decent murder mystery / cast rich film can recieve awards, shouldn't we consider the lesser? Gosford Park is a good movie, a really good one. But, If you don't have interest in period films, or have problem's with quick, overlapping and sometimes unintelligable dialogue (sub-t are helpful) then don't see it. The British accent's neither help nor hinder the problem.<br />(If you have a surround sound set-up, listen out for the cigarette effect that takes place in left speaker, when the inspector first goes into the kitchen with the servants. It is a nice touch.)<br />Maggie Smith is always good in whatever she does, and transend's what could have been a drab character creating some nifty moments. You can tell she had fun with the material. The most interesting character was the Inspector, who's detatched effort's made me sit up in my seat. His performance reminded me of something Orson Welles would do if he were living today in his prime. Ryan Phillippe seemed out of place, but its good to see that he's branching out of the \\"Teen flick\\" category, and took a great step by participating. Freddy Prinze should follow his example (unfortunately he has been tackled to continue in the next two Scooby-poo sequels).<br />As a fan of period film's, I liked Gosford Park, but if I were just an everyday movie goer who had low tolerance for quick dialogue and spent my life avoiding shows like \\"Mystery\\", then you may want to miss it. ~s.a.o.s.~
B00005N919|5.0|Sharon Stone is extremely beautiful in this film. Although this is not a perfect movie, Sharon herself is worth 5 stars. The other reviewer is right, perfect face, perfect body, and perfect acting
B00005Y228|5.0|this cd is a must have.....it is so cool, if u like dance music, this is by far the best ive ever heard !!
B000002GGU|5.0|This was an outstanding recording from start to finish.  It amazes me how good the songs are that never received radio airplay.  I guess the 'radio powers that be' thought six from one recording should be the limit.  Song after song is a winner.  With &quot;Reckless&quot;, Bryan Adams showed us that there was still such a thing a &quot;pop-rock&quot; or &quot;light-rock&quot; of quality.  That could be listened to by rockers (granted, maybe not hard core headbangers) and poppies and be liked by both groups.  This was the one recording at the time that my girlfriend and I both enjoyed, so we could listen together.  On all other music we split like oil and water, haha.  <br />I enjoyed this so much that I recently bought the CD even though I owned the cassette tape since its initial release.  I still enjoy the music on this recording.  It has stood the test of time.  I recommend this recording as a very good introduction to Bryan Adams.  Buy it, you will enjoy it.
0380817683|5.0|I started this book with high expectations because Keyes fans all told me this was Marian's best. Well, I love all of her books equally even after this one, they are all simply fabulous. <br />This is the story of the middle Walsh sister Rachel's coming of age. In her mid-late twenties, and living in NYC with her best friend from Dublin, Rachel constantly struggles with how people perceive her. Insecure and immature, she uses drugs as a way to cope with everything, without realizing how much she uses them. <BR>The dichotomy between Rachel's development and her roommate's helps us see the magnitude of Rachel's drug problem. Brigit gets promotions and new jobs, where as Rachel parties, skips work, and is unfaithful and mean to her wonderful boyfriend simply because she is quite certain that even though she likes him, he is not cool enough. <br />Well, eventually she over doses and lands herself in a hospital. Despite her certainty that she does not have a problem, her parents take her to the Cloisters, a rehab center for various kinds of addicts. At first Rachel is angry at everyone for putting her in this place, but since she believes there will be stars and famous people there she accepts her fate. But when she realizes this is not a retreat for the stars, she has to succumb to the treatment and the realization that she does have a problem. Confronted by her boyfriend, her family and her best friend, she begins to see herself more clearly. Only then is she able to transform herself. <br />This is a wonderful and often times funny coming of age story. All of the Walsh sisters are a delight to read about, and Rachel is surely no exception. My favorite thing of all about Keyes, aside from excellent characters, great love stories, and consistent laughs, is that the endings leave you feeling satisfied and ready to move on to the next story Ms. Keyes presents us with. I already have Angels by my bedside.
0312265859|3.0|First off, I have to say, I've read the whole series, and love these books!  Stephanie and her gaggle of friends and relatives are truly original characters.  And the world that Janet creates is one that I want to visit time and again.  Having said that, I think this book is the weakest of the series.  Stephanie never really solves anything.  She just sort of runs around where people tell her to go and in the end, someone else deals with everything for her.  I also have to agree with the reviewer who found the sex scene with Ranger anti-climatic.  It's time for Stephanie to grow a little as a character!  Let her polish up her skills a little.  Let her marry Morelli!  There's lots of drama and comedy to be had, but the character needs to develop.  This one felt like a re-tread.
B00005RFAI|5.0|OK, so maybe I am a crusty 30 yearr old who thinks the best music, bar none, came from the 1980s; that the closest to hit music these days involves Train, ColdPlay, Travis, Jimmy Eat World and a dash of New Order (yeah, their new album too).  Well, Katie-bar-the-door, Pink restores faith in the future of a saturated, cynical &quot;pop&quot; market.  She writes, she sings and her voice? It's the occassionally acrid honey collected during a brisk spring morning.<br />bottom line:  If you want popular music deep to the core in the essentials:  good tunes, good lyrics and magnificient presentation.  Get Pink. Get it now.
B0000640VN|4.0|The movie was a charming, &quot;likable&quot; romantic comedy. Hugh Jackman was great. The commentary by the director was the most boring thing I have had the misfortune to hear (portions, anyway). I kept fast forwarding hoping that he would say something interesting about the filming process, the shots, the actors, the improvisations, but good anecdotes were few and far between. Instead, lots and lots of lengthy discourse about his view of the meaning of the film (yawn) - 5 minutes of talk to make a simple point. WE GET IT - move on.
0066620996|5.0|Possibly the best business book I've ever read, or at least the best that wasn't a journalistic narrative or a history. Most business &quot;advice&quot; books really just amount to hero worship (how to be like Jack Welch, or whoever), and Good to Great is a strong antidote to all that rot. While we gravitate toward big personalities and dramatic stories, the real roots of greatness like elsewhere -- the CEO names in Good to Great won't be familiar to most readers, but their successes are real, and Collins and his team do a nice job of extracting meaning from the data they've assembled. One among many surprising conclusions is that charismatic leaders might actually be a *detriment* to their firms. Then again, after Ebbers, Skilling, and others, maybe we won't find that news so surprising any more... Anyway, the book is clearly written and thoughtfully organized, and well worth reading if you're interested, for whatever reason, in what makes some companies thrive and others fail. A wise book.
B00005JL3A|4.0|This film was a first of it's kind in my opinion.It gets a lot of very bad reviews,and I just don't see why.The plot was very good,and thickened as the movie went on.Besides the few gory scenes,it was a fairly well directed movie that made you jump every few minutes.I wouldn't suggest lettingyoung children watch it...two words \\"BAD DREAMS!!!\\".So,I give it a 4 out of 5.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya is great! When I first heard \\"only time\\" on the radio I loved it. Enya has a great voice and her music is soothing. The whole album is peaceful although the album's fourth track brings thoughts of darkness and terror to the mind. The album is very different from the albums you hear these days. At a peak Billboard point of #2, this album in a way serenades the mind to peacefulness. It's a collection of sweet melodies and thought-evoking ideas. It's really inspiring and it reduces stress. It's an album for all New Age music fans (namely Enigma) as well as quite a few pop fans for instance Alanis Morissette (although a lot of her music is alternative) and Celine Dion. Just as good as her \\"Shepard moon\\" album and better than her \\"Celts\\" album, this album is a must-have. It has songs for all kinds of tastes (except R&B) from the fast strong emotion in \\"wild child\\" to my favourite song in the album \\"only time\\". I only wish that \\"may it be\\" was also included in this album. Speaking of which, the music from the title track \\"a day without rain\\" reminded me of \\"may it be\\". The album with it's echo sounds is like a peaceful version of Cher's dance hit \\"believe\\". The album with it's mixed music collaborations and soothing musical themes is fantastic.        If you're buying this album to bring peace to your life-make sure you hear \\"lazy days\\". Otherwise if you're a pop/new age artist fan-hear all the songs! The album is also for all Celtic music lovers with it's great Irish background music. Since I love \\"Riverdance\\", I loved this album!
6304698798|5.0|Arguably one of the best epic westerns ever made and the ultimate male macho movie.  Three men whose lives cross when the search for confederate money leads them through the war torn west of the Amercian Civil War. Clint Eastwood (Blondie/man with no name), Lee Van Cleef (Angel Eyes) and Eli Wallach (Tuco) are the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly respectively, each with their own agenda to get to a cemetary and a certain grave holding dirty loot. Sergio Leone's direction can be compared to the european comics of the time in which the movie screen, like comic strip panels, have close-ups of the characters with sweeping backgrounds.  The DVD widescreen format restores Leone's great camera work and sense of composition. When shown on regular tv, the viewer gets an old or bad print of the film in pan and scan format and all that great compostion is lost. The score and theme song by Ennio Morricone is legendary and familiar and the characters are sweaty, dirty, and real. Its amazing that the story takes place in the American Civil War west, but it was actually filmed in the deserts of Spain. Clint Eastwood's man with no name is as cool and macho as ever, but Eli Wallach's role as the wanted bandit, \\"Tuco\\" is the standout character and he should have won an Oscar for that performance.  The DVD has a trailer and interesting liner notes, but one wishes an actor or director commentary.  Perhaps a special edition DVD will someday be released. Note: Classic Line(s) - \\"If you have to shoot..shoot! Don't talk!\\" and \\"When your hanging on that rope, you can feel the devil biting your a--!\\"
B00006ADD5|5.0|David Lean's masterpiece opens in Cairo during World War I where a young British soldier with a desire for adventure is assigned to help the Arabs fight the Turks in Arabia. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) proves to be a man of great courage and compassion. He unites the warring tribes of Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) and Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). Together they are victorious in reclaiming several important Arab cities.<br /><br />Watching this glorious movie is worthwhile, even if it is on the small TV screen. It is refreshing to see a movie that is made without CGI: The sweeping desert vistas were filmed in real deserts and all the people are real. The unforgettable soundtrack by Maurice Jarre is as good as ever. Peter O'Toole is simple perfect as the conflicted Lawrence and Omar Sharif is also great as his friend, Ali. (Alec Guinness, however, is completely miscast as Arab Prince Feisal.)<br /><br />This true story of an ordinary man who accomplished extraordinary things is beautifully filmed and defines the word, \\"epic.\\" It won seven Academy Awards in 1962, including Best Picture. Heartily recommended. (This DVD does not have any extras, but the price is right.)
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I loved this CD. Many say that their first album which was self titled, is their best album. I disagree.<br />At first, you think Tom Morello is just going to play another generic metal buildup, which then you find out, it dosen't build up at all. In fact, unlike most metal bands, if you use the \\"angry-o-meter\\", you see huge spikes in each song.<br />Zach de la Roca is a great vocalist, you not only hear rage, you feel it when he sings. The tone of voice he uses when he sings sounds like he actually means what he is saying. And hes not just a wailing idiot like 9\10s of the metal bands out there. <br />This band beats literally every band or group i have ever seen period. Limp Bizkit dosen't even come close to these guys. Limp Bizkit is just a bunch of screaming idiots who think they are cool.<br />Left Wingers, you should buy this CD if you want to hear songs that talk from your own point of view. Right Wingers, you should also buy this CD if you want to have your own ideas challenged by others.<br />And if you just like originality, buy this CD.
0679745203|5.0|No, I'm not talking about the movie--although it's not a bad watch AFTER reading the book. This is one of the best novels I've read in my life, including all those so-called &quot;classics,&quot; not so much for the story, but for the prose. The prose is hauntingly beautiful, almost to the point of giving you goosebumps. It's totally compelling.<br />At heart, the underlying story of &quot;The English Patient&quot; is not new. It's about an adulterous love affair that ends in tragedy. But of course, I don't think that's really the point of the book. There's a reason the novel is written in the present, with flashbacks to the past. The book explores how the characters, from different walks of life, react to the situation they find themselves in, from the traumatized nurse Hana to the stoic sapper Kip.<br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great book to read. You'll feel good after you're done with it.
0312265859|4.0|I must agree with some of the other reviewers that this book was more predictable.  I still LOVED it and am rereading AGAIN.  <br />I was slightly disappointed in the ending also and with \\"the sex scene\\".  I think both characters grew with the scene though and Steph walked away more sure of herself.  <br />I can't wait for number nine and the one that is coming out at Christmas.
B000066NW0|5.0|The cd is great especially the hit 'complicated' the fact that somebody finnaly stood up and said that you shoud be who you are and not someone else is fantastic.  She is her own type of music and there is a song for every human emotion on the cd.  Avril Lavigne will be around for a long time and is a great role model for teens everywhere.
B0000640VN|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. I LOVED IT. I SAW IT WITH FIVE OTHER WOMEN. ALL AGREE THAT HUGH MADE THE MOVIE BELIEVEABLE. ALSO, IT MADE US THINK THAT JUST MAYBE  THE COMFORTS AND CONVIENCES THAT WE ALL SHARE HAVE COME AT A PRICE . STOP SMELL THE ROSES.SS
0790729628|4.0|Even though Ridley Scotts talents are formidable His choice of removing Fords voiceover was a mistake...The original had the feeling of an old Bogart Sam Spade film.whereas the \\"Director's Cut\\" left me feeling wanting for more.
B000065U1N|5.0|After reading the reviews posted here, especially the negative ones, all I can think is: so this is where decades of hyper-dogmatic, unthinking liberalism have led us.  The United States undertakes a humanitarian mission (however ill-conceived) and when attacked while attempting to apprehend some of those responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths by starvation, it is the United States who is \\"xenophobic\\" and \\"racist.\\"  I hate to tell all the brittle people out there who couldn't bare the sight of the Americans shooting Somalis simply beacuse the latter were black, but this is a true story.  Ridley Scott couldn't just rearrange facts and have the operation take place in Stockholm against the Swedes.  I hate to say it but there are some people in Africa who are not good people, just like you would find anywhere else.  To think otherwise is as racist as you purport the movie to be.  And as for the film maker portraying the Somalis we fought as marauding savages, well the truth hurts.  It happened this way.  Talk to anyone who was actually in Somalia at that time.  The vast majority of the country were just trying to live and were actually being oppressed by the people we fought.  But apparently the color of their skin obsolves some Somalis from any guilt.  It is a truly tragic state of affairs when so many people do not have the requisite moral depth to tell right from wrong, and try to hide their deficit behind a wall of \\"nuance.\\"  See this movie and decide for yourself.  For me, I walked away in awe of the skill and sacrifice on the part of the US soldiers.
B000066NW0|4.0|Okay, so this music doesn't have a WHOLE lot behind it, but that's why I like it!! Sometimes you just need music that's fun to listen to, that you can blast in your car with your girlfriends, on the way to the beach or going out! It's fun to sing along to and who said good music has to be deep music! I think Avril Lavigne knows how to write a fun song that people want to listen to. If you need an album that's just fun to put on and play through, then this is perfect!!
B00005NSAV|5.0|There's no need to review this masterpiece, desert island kinda CD for those who enjoy Progressive Rock of early 70's.  But the Japanese edition deserves a word for its quality. Impressive sound and excellent art. The package truly resembles the original record in small scale. The extra $$$ is worth the while.
B000066NW0|2.0|I'm not a person that hates trendy music. I'm not against Hot Topic. I think people should be able to listen to the music that people want to listen to, shop wherever the want to, etc. <br />   Behind the 'punk rock image' Avril plays music that you've heard before. She deals with the same lyrical topics as many pop icons that you hear on MTV. Avril isn't really groundbreaking. Sorry to break the hearts of some.<br />   However, I will give Avril credit for writing her own material at a young age. She mixes her influences up, but as I said earlier, it's been done before, and it's been done better.
0345350499|3.0|Arthurian retellings are as common today as they were five hundred years ago.  Unfortunately.  Most if not all have the lamentable if understandable flaw of using Sir Thomas Malory's version of the legends as a starting point.  Malory is appealing to many because his approach is a relatively 'modern' one: his tale is an effort to unify the disparate elements of the Arthurian cycle, to scientifically sort and rank the various protagonists and their encounters on a sliding scale of prowess and morality.  His version makes the most 'sense' to many because it tries to be as complete as possible, and to reconcile the abundant seeming contradictions of the story cycle: Who was the best knight, really?  What was the chronology of all these adventures? What did it all *mean*? And so forth.  But Malory was simply the final note, the literary death-knell of a rich and fluid narrative tradition that had flourished for centuries.  His is the final Arthurian story that can truly be called 'medieval'; but it's certainly not the most medieval of them all.  The best stories were really those which took place in the timeless context of Arthur's realm, before the hand of Destiny began weighing down the court and the tragic fall of the principals became the overwhelming theme of an increasingly inflexible story arc.<br />Zimmer Bradley has crafted a rich and well-wrought narrative focusing on the unsung trials and quiet heroism (and villainy) of the women in Arthur's life.  But her goal is not to reinvent Malory so much as recast his tale from a different perspective.  This is no mean feat, to be sure, and Mists of Avalon deserves a place on a short list of significant Arthurian adaptations this century.  The hand of tragic narrative destiny hangs heavy over this version, however, as it does in Malory's version; and though the tragedy is a central component to her theme, one wishes that she had perhaps looked a bit further back than the 15th century for her inspiration.  Malory's lifeended with the Late Middle Ages fading fast before the Renaissance - the passing of an age.  Perhaps this sensibility was most appropriate for what Zimmer Bradley wished to accomplish - the portrayal of powerful women being upstaged, usurped, or misunderstood by the wounded men destined to write the history books.  But this sad sense of defeat, as in Malory, succeeds in diminishing the legend in a way that is itself somewhat tragic.
6305079811|4.0|Break out the crackers, there's enough cheese in this film to go around the block three times. Great soundtrack-go Queen. What a fun time I had watching this film.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes kick [butt]......thats about all i've got to say about that........and everyone who says they [stink].....Don't know what they're talking about, and don't know what they're missing.
0780021967|5.0|THE 39 STEPS was one of Hitchcock's first films to be a genuine success--and it's just as entertaining today as it probably was when it was first released.  For the first time, Hitchcock employs the theme of the &quot;wrong man&quot; on the run not only from spies, but also from the police (which explains why he cannot go to them for help). In this case, Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) becomes involved with a secret agent who spends the night with him and then winds up dead.  Hannay soon finds himself on the run from other spies who think he knows too much and want him dead.  Eventually, he finds himself handcuffed to Pamela (Madeliene Carroll), a young blonde who, in typical Hollywood fasion, fumes at him for most of the picture before they both realize that they're in love.  THE 39 STEPS provides consistent entertainment as it zips frantically from one scenario to the next--just as Hannay gets out of one trap, he falls into another.  (The most fascinating &quot;episode&quot; in the film occurs when Hannay spends the night at a farm in the Scottish countryside with a sternly religious farmer and his wife.)  It is certainly the best of Hitchcock's &quot;on the run&quot; films, which later included NORTH BY NORTHWEST; THE 39 STEPS is short, suspenseful (but never really frightening), at times drily funny, and even romantic.
0790729407|4.0|I badly wanted to see this movie when it came out in theatres, but I was home with my newborn boy so I settled for renting it months later. This film is spectacular - I love anything to do with Ireland as well as political figures so this was a treat for me. Liam Neeson is superb as the main character, Michael Collins, whom I had never heard of and learned about through watching this film. How historically accurate it is is debatable, but bear in mind this is just a movie. If you would like accurate historical facts, there are many books right here on amazon.com that provide just that. But this is just a movie, and as such, should be taken with a grain of salt.  <br />This is a downright good film about a brave and passionate Irishman who loves his country and independence and will fight for them until death. (Which, of course, is his fate.) Collins struggles against English imperialism as almost all Northern Irishmen do, the difference being that Collins has wit and an extra boost of courage and will. <br />The cinematography is beautiful - very well done. The story moves along at a good pace and the rest of the actors are pretty good, too, except for Julia Roberts, whom I think should not have been in this film. Aidan Quinn is Collins' sidekick who seems to have a trivial role, but is good nonetheless. <br />Is Collins a terrorist? Is his character as portrayed in this movie a hero or a bad guy? Who actually killed him? (We see a young boy kill Michael Collins, but who put him up to it?) The answers are arguable and you will not actually find them in this movie. However, my amazon friends, this is a very moving film and one worth seeing more than once. I recommend it highly!
B000065KFV|5.0|HEAVENLY CREATURES, directed by Peter Jackson of the new LORD OF THE RINGS movies, it is the true story of two mentally unstable young girls who eventually commit murder in their determination to stay together.  Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey play two teenage girls growing up in New Zealand during the 1950's.  Both are eccentric outcasts who spend their time talking of imaginary kingdoms and acting out elaborate fairy tales.  Eventually, the girls become so attached to one another that their parents attempt to separate them...and they actually murder Lynskey's mother, thinking it will somehow help keep them together.  A summary of the film's plot does not give an accurate impression of its brilliance, however; Jackson brings us inside the minds of the girls as they become increasingly more detached from reality.  The result is a harrowing, flawlessly directed film (the scenes building up to the murder are both chilling and beautiful).  While Jackson is currently receiving much attention for his admittedly wonderful handling of the commercially popular LORD OF THE RINGS movies, this little film (hardly seen by anyone but the critics) is well worth checking out--it's undoubtedly a better film than LORD OF THE RINGS and certainly much more emotionally powerful.
0671042858|3.0|Nine year old Trisha McFarland, wearing her favorite blue Red Sox batting practice shirt and Red Sox cap, began her six mile hike in the woods with her mother and brother Pete.  Her troubled brother and recently divorced mother were constantly bickering.  This hike of the Applachian Trail could not for one moment extinguish or interrupt their steady flow of quarreling.  To evade this annoying and endless confrontation, Trisha drops back and wanders off.  She decides to go forward instead of backtracking to the path and unknowingly strays further and further into the wilderness.  Trisha listens to her Walkman for comfort and hears the Boston Red Sox game being broadcast and anxiously awaits the performance of her hero, number 36, relief pitcher, Tom Gordon.  Trisha truly amazed me with every turn of the page, displaying courage, faith and a will to survive.  Stephen King transports the reader to a new plateau of emotions in this novel.  Did I mention that I was also a Red Sox fan?

B000002KCF|5.0|I was introduced to Michael Franks over ten years ago. Art of Tea along Sleeping Gypsy are my favorite two CD's.  Art of Tea is subtle, lyrical, playful, and sexy, which I don't hear a lot of in today's overproduced and overaggresive pop music scene. My favorite tracks are \\"Nightmoves,\\" \\"Eggplant\\" and of course \\"Popsicle Toes.\\" If want to introduced someone to Michael Franks, I would suggest this CD.
0060925000|5.0|This book is really long, but worth the read.  The characters are so richly developed, and their lives all entertwine eventually in the book.  It is just amazing.  I loved each and every character in this book.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to read.
B000005JA8|5.0|Clearly this isn't for everybody. It's very, very weird. Weirder than Frank Zappa, but if you enjoy him you'd probably appreciate this. It's usually tuneless, raspy and very cryptic lyric-wise. It is a brilliant album, bluesy and insane, and not commercial and radio-friendly. I pity the reviewer who'd rather listen to old donny and Marie, but admittedly, this album is for people who appreciate the absurd. A squid eating dough in a polythene bag is fast and bulbous- got me?
0684874350|3.0|Maybe I was expecting to much, because the reviews I read kept proclaiming this book to be a masterpiece.  However, as one reviewer has already said, it got slightly repetitive after the second half.  Also, while I didn't mind the depressing nature of the book (that actually added to its allure), I am not a big fan of McCourt's writing style.  At times it was slightly confusing, at others it was annoying.  The book is a good, decent read, and I would still recommend it, but I can't gvie it a glowing review or more than 3 stars, especially when I have much better books on my shelf.  Try Bulgakov or Maguire for better reading.
B000022TSH|5.0|&quot;Chinatown&quot; is one of the classics, a flawlessly-acted, superbly-written, steadily-directed film noir exposing the underbelly of Los Angeles in the 1930s.  Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are in top form, as is director Roman Polanski.  An essential for any serious film collection.
B00005JKNF|4.0|While the first time I saw this movie I wondered what all the fuss was about, it has grown on me with repeat viewings.  There are some easily missed subtlties (some of the dialog is hard to catch) which enrich the story.  It is also easier to get into the story when you know the relationships between the characters, which may not be 100% clear on first viewing.  Using the subtitles may help you capture the rich dialogue that give this film it's depth.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the movie version of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;.  The casting, especially Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione, was dead on; the characters were presented almost exactly as I'd imagined.  The film stuck religiously to the book, which I appreciated, but it did seem to run a little long.  Still, it was quite fun, especially the Quidditch match and the invisibility cloak.  &quot;Harry Potter&quot; made me wish I was a little kid again, with an active imagination and a heart full of wonder.<br />*Note - too scary for little kids
0380789019|4.0|This book is so out there, it really shows what a good imagination can create.  A dark underword filled with all sorts of mixxed up cultures that leave the reader thinking about what is really out there and how we became meshed in the world that we do live in.  There are great plot twists and character revelations that it is more than just fun.  It makes us examine our lives and status and askes us to search for something that is different than what society  considers acceptable.  Pure bliss in its forming of scenery and off the wall characters.  I recommend for anyone who enjoys reading the fantastic.
B00005AXEL|5.0|&quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; was my introduction to Stevie.  I read some positive reviews of the disc and decided to pick it up; what a good move on my part!  It's hardly left my CD player since.  There is no filler on this album; every song is solid.  A personal, intimate album, it also rocks, especially with the superior &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;.  Other highlights include &quot;Bombay Sapphire&quot;, an amazing track with Macy Gray on backing vocals, &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;, and the title track.  The slower songs are equally good.  There is no abrupt change in mood; every track segues gracefully into the next.  Sheryl Crow, Natalie Maines, and Sarah McLachlan also appear as duet partners.<br />I recommend this album to any casual Stevie fans.  It has certainly made me more than a casual one.  In fact, I even went to see her in concert, which was incredible.  These new songs hold up very well live and blend in effortlessly with her other classics.  Get it, play it, and see for yourself.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This movie is so fantastic. A story of perserverence and determination, and a story of fighting to build a new beauty on an ancient canvass. War, and Arabian culture, and British pride express themselves over magnificent desert scenery. It is inspirational and beautiful and tragic. The desert is brought to life in this epic. David Lean does a fantastic job in casting and directing, and Peter O'Toole is perfect. Laurence of Arabia is a movie that everyone should watch.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Despite what a lot of people think about this movie in respect to the original trilogy, this movie is awesome.  It introduces us to the charters and sets the stage for the next two films.  Things that appear in this film, but nowhere else in the series are understandable.  This is the first Film, not the Forth.  Why would Lucas continually bring up trivial information in every film when it has already been stated in the first film and should be remembered by every fan of this movie.  What people don't understand is that this film has too be watched without the other three in mind, because in relation to this film, the events in EP 4-6 haven't even happened or been perceived.  Once EP 3 is released and everyone gets a chance to watch all SIX films in conjunction, those who said this movie was a waste will change their tune.
B00005NB0H|5.0|How can you improve on a perfect album widely considered the best live performance committed to audio? For one thing, you add more perfection to it. That's the case of the recently released deluxe edition Live at Leeds. Already a spectacular live set with such blistering numbers as Heaven and Hell, Young Man Blues, and My Generation, the legendary concert has been restored to it's original entirety with the addition of the complete rendition of Tommy. Now more than a great live set, it is more like a master work of art that gets better with each exposure. Who fans could not ask for a better documentation of the band at their performance peak. This is an absolute must for Who fans and connoisseurs of live albums. This album can also serve as a fitting tribute to departed members and Keith and John (R.I.P. fellas). Add this to your collection and experience live albums the way they should be.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Director Ron Howard shows once again why every big star in Hollywood wants to work for him.  Although not an original work of art, we are allowed to see the struggles of an individual who in is brilliance suffers from delusions of people and events that do not exist.  A touching story about the struggles of life and the determination of the human spirit.  I am not sure if this qualifies as a Best Picture of the Year, but with great performances by Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris, it was enjoyable to watch.  Although I do not hail this as Russell Crowe's best performance, he was successful in his depiction of Nash.

B000001GBJ|5.0|I first heard \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" playing in a music store eight years ago, and I was entranced from the very first note. The music was a blend of classical, Celtic and Norwegian, a stunning combination of piano, violin, orchestra and voice. It was unlike anything I'd ever heard before: deeply moving, relaxing, meditative, a journey to a secret garden, perfect music for reflection on a rainy day.<br />Secret Garden is made up of Norwegian composer Rolf Lovland on piano and Irish violinist Fionnuala Sherry. They have since released four other CDs: \\"White Stones,\\" \\"Dawn of a New Century,\\" \\"Dreamcatcher\\" (a best-of compilation taken from the first three releases), and \\"Once in a Red Moon,\\" but for me \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" remains their masterpiece. It is by turns gentle, romantic, melancholy, playful and joyous. There is a Celtic element on some of the songs (\\"Sigma,\\" with an Irish-language chorus and a boy soprano, \\"The Rap,\\"), but it is not as marked as their later releases, which to me sound like Riverdance imitations and have lost all of the \\"Secret Garden\\" magic for me. \\"Nocturne\\" features the stunning vocals of Gunnhild Tvinnereim, and this was the song that first catapulted Secret Garden to fame (it won the 1995 Eurovision song contest for Norway). My other favourite songs from the collection are \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" and \\"Sigma.\\"<br /> (I was lucky enough to pick up a copy of the sheet music to \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" and I play selections from it every day. The foreword is in English and Norwegian, and there are additional notes by Rolf regarding performance tips and inspirations behind the songs. If you play piano, this is a worthy investment for a Secret Garden fan. The collection features all thirteen songs from \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" and is available at their official website at [...])<br />This is still a very popular album even though it was released in 1994: it is one of BMG Music Club's top-selling classical CDs, Barbara Streisand did a cover of \\"Heartstrings\\" for her wedding, adding lyrics and renaming it \\"I've Dreamed of You,\\" and some of my favourite places in Qu&eacute;bec City use \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" as background music (Aux Anciens Canadiens, 34 Rue Saint-Louis, Domaine Steinbach,  2205, chemin Royal<br />Saint-Pierre de l'Île d'Orl&eacute;ans).<br />This is the only CD I reach for after a long day. The stress just melts away and my spirits are lifted instantly. \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" is perfect for anyone seeking a quiet moment in their lives, a moment to reflect, dream, love, and explore their own secret garden.ra Streisand did a cover of \\"Heartstrings\\" for her wedding, adding lyrics and renaming it \\"I've Dreamed of You,\\" and some of my favourite places in Québec City use \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" as background music (Aux Anciens Canadiens, 34 Rue Saint-Louis, Domaine Steinbach,  2205, chemin Royal <BR>Saint-Pierre de l'Île d'Orléans).<br />This is the only CD I reach for after a long day.

6302902010|4.0|I have been fortunate enough to see three live performances of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; as an opera: first the Houston Grand Opera production with Donnie Rae Albert and Clamma Dale around 20 years ago, then the Met production with Roberta Alexander around 10 years ago, and most recently Alvy Powell and Marquita Lister in Hartford 3 years or so ago. It's a great work, and richly deserves a production as lovingly prepared as this one. Let me first say the cast is superb. This is &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; sung the way I'm conviced George Gershwin envisioned it, as an opera. There are, however, a few disappointing (to me) features of the production. To begin with, no goat! Porgy is a crippled beggar who transports himself by driving a goat cart. Here, he maneuvers himself around on makeshift crutches. In the final scene, therefore, he has to say &quot;I must go&quot; [after Bess] instead of the original devastating &quot;Bring my goat.&quot; When he repeats &quot;Bring my goat&quot; the request becomes a command. Having him repeat &quot;I must go&quot; is not nearly as effective, since he's not asking anyone to do anything for him. When he does leave, it's without the crutches, as he hobbles off into a Hollywood fadeout. The reason for dropping his crutches escapes me. Also, Sportin' Life's &quot;There's a Boat Leaving Soon for New York&quot; ends with Bess slamming the door after entering the room she shares with Porgy. It leaves the false impression that she's resisted Sportin' Life's tempting offer. So it comes as a shock to us as well as Porgy when she's not around to welcome Porgy home. The Met staged this especially well, having Bess enter the room, then reach out to take the &quot;happy dust&quot; Sportin' Life leaves for her, finally slinking back out, one long bare leg first, having changed back into the tart outfit she wore at the beginning of the opera. Then there's the matter of the &quot;Buzzard Song&quot; -- why was it cut? It was cut at the first New York production, I know, but so was the Jasbo Brown piano solo, and that's here in a nicely done sleazy nightclub introductory scene. I also wish there had been subtitles -- although the work is sung in English, anyone with any experience listening to opera knows that the words do frequently get lost. Finally, there's the lip-synching problems mentioned by several prior reviewers. One last thing -- at least on the VCR I used to watch this, the orchestral sound was not forward enough. Opera is singing, yes, but the orchestra plays a vital role, and it needs to be heard, especially with the wonderful touches Gershwin has written into this masterpiece. I also thought Simon Rattle's conducting was, at times, a little flaccid. But with so much of value in this production, I still recommend it highly, as probably the only video production we're likely to have for some time.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a book I couldn't put down until I was finished and I didn't want it to end. Sebold's device of having Susie, the murder victim, tell the story from heaven gives us a unique viewpoint of the effect of her murder and her loss on family, friends, and even people that Susie hadn't known in life. In life as individuals in such a situation go through the stages of grief, each focuses on his or her own response; their world becomes very small. The family in The Lovely Bones is no different; each starts on his or her journey of loss and coping, growing apart from each other. Susie the storyteller, is in the<br />position to see into the lives and thoughts not only of those who grieve for her loss, but also into those of her killer. She watches the growing apart of her family, and in her way, helps to effect their eventual coming back together. Along the way, she describes her experience of the afterlife and her growing knowledge, that although she is separated from her family, and that their grief will lessen and they will move on, she will forever be present in each of them. Susie, in heaven feels the separation as profoundly as her family and yearns for them and the experiences her early death has denied her.  As in life, there is no easy resolution of the crime that takes her away from her family, but in many ways, the murder is the least of this story. As the sister of a teenaged murder victim, I read this book in her memory; she will have been gone for 31 years this month. In some way, her absence makes her forever present, but in a matter-of fact way, not that horribly empty torn away feeling that is the first response to a death. I found the story to be filled with wisdom, a gentle humor, a terrible sadness, and much truth in its description of the way grief changes us, but ultimately, Susie's voice comforted me. Grandma Lynn,the wisecracking, often tipsy, salt of the earth backbone of the family is priceless. I highly recommend this book for its unique perspective on a shattering event in the life of a family and a community.nique perspective on a shattering event in the life of a family and a community.

B00005YUNY|4.0|As _Live from the House of Blues_ caught Yes on The Ladder Tour from 1999, _Yes - Symphonic Live_ captues Yes on their Symphonic Tour from 2001 featuring Jon Anderson, Alan White, Chris Squire, and Steve Howe with touring keyboard player Tom Brislin, and a symphony.  In addition to the classics (\\"And You And I\\", \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"I've Seen All Good People\\"), Yes also play about 25 minutes of material from their very good orchestral 2001 release, _Magnification_.<br />It's nice that \\"Magnification\\" and \\"In the Presence Of\\" are featured on this DVD as it is unknown as to whether or not either of these two very good songs will be played live again.  \\"Close to the Edge\\" starts out disappointingly slow, but it does redeem itself about halfway through until the end.  And the performances of \\"Gates of Delirium\\" and \\"Ritual\\" are worth the price of the DVD alone.  Extra features include hit-or-miss animation that can be turned off or turned on while you watch the concert.  The DVD also features Anderson's banter inbetween songs.  There is also a 30 minute documentary that features the band members talking about _Magnification_ and playing with an orchestra.  Die hard fans will really enjoy this section.  The MVP of this DVD is Squire who still commands his instrument like few others, and sounds in top-form on backup vocals.  <br />Overall, this DVD is very, very good.  If you really enjoyed the Symphonic Tour, or perhaps missed it, then you should pick this us to remember the, as Anderson would describe it, \\"magical and beautiful\\" experience.
B000001E7T|4.0|This album was greeted by great reviews upon it's release several years ago, and at the time I thought quite a bit of it.  In retrospect however, I have to concede that it does not get the repeated listens of a classic release.  I think PJ Harvey is at her best when she has alot of herself invested in a song, and on this disk she seems just to be telling stories.  Nonetheless, this is still a compelling listen, with several solid tracks.  Strange as it may seem, I prefer the much maloignerd Stories of.. to this.  PJ Harvey remains an artist whose work is always of interest.
B0000524CY|5.0|Once in a while Holywood will release a horror flim that goes above and beyond your avrage Holywood release that's dose not just fade away after Commercial and Block Buster success. The 70's were a blessed time for that. In the horror genre. Thier were heavywights \\"The Evil Dead\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacare\\", \\"Jaws\\" and of course \\"The Exorsicts\\". <br />Between the two virsions of The Exorsicts that were made I don't see why it was criticized by many people. There's just one seen added and a remasterd sound and color job. Some hated the virsion. I say that it adds to the experince a bit. The experince in frightining bliss. Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn, and Max Van Sydow's performance's are unforgetable.

1559409002|5.0|\\"Carnival of Souls\\" is simply unlike any other low buget  horror/Fantasy I have ever seen as far as I know has ever been done before. Even though the very perfound plot to \\"Carnival of Souls\\"(which deals with death and the after life) has been done many times. This is the most original movie I have ever seen that deals with that kind of a subject matter, despite of dated eleaments. Carnival of Souls is stright to the point stroytelling, but as the film gose on you can really tell Writer John clifford and Producer/Director Herk Harvey had put tones of imagination into this movie. <br />I highly suggest \\"Carnival of Souls\\" to any serious film buffs out there. <br />As for the DVD?? I rented this awsome edition \\"Carnival of Souls\\" rather then buy it and like the Criterion disks I have veiewed before this one it was very good with very intresting supplaments to offer.
6305718954|4.0|I enjoyed the movie; the acting, special effects and entertainment level were enough to keep me glued to the TV. For 2 hours.  This movie more than for entertainment value should make people question at least the Catholic faith.  I believe in God I always have, but I have never bought into the belief that you have to belong to a church or a certain religion to be with Jesus.  Since the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls there has been controversy and this movie raises the question if the Vatican has been forthcoming about the interpretation of the scrolls or if they have held something back in fear that the truth would unravel the Vatican and the Catholic religion as a whole.<br />I don't have the answer I just live by the motto &quot;question everything&quot;.  You may never know the answer but it is everyone's responsibility to &quot;find out for themselves&quot; to the best of their ability.
B00005YU1O|5.0|The first thing I must mention as well as appalud about \\"Waking Life\\" is the animation job done here. Its as if the flimakers here shot everyting on a normal camera and then went back into the sudio and then painted over it. Weather or not they acually did that or not I am not sure. The effect is truly trippy, and very uniqe. I have never seen anything quite like it berfore. <br />Next thing I must mention and appalud is the screenplay. Its a screenplay that asks the complex quastions of life. Like what are we here for? Is there life after death? What are dreams? <br />Warning. If you like to watch movies or you like to watch animated flicks, because you like to zone off, rather than think hard about what your watching. I suggest you avoid this.
B000062Y98|2.0|I purchased this CD based on some amazing reviews I have read for this record. The first thing that came to my mind upon listening to this was Spinal Tap. Is this some sort of heavy metal spoof or joke? I will admit that the musicianship on this record is quite astonishing and there is no doubt that there is talent in this band, but this just sounds like fire and brimstone power metal. I have been a fan of Iron Maiden for years, and this band is no Iron Maiden. Iron Maiden has an addictive quality to their music, which is sorely lacking in Blind Guardian. The only addictive trait to Blind Guardian is what I perceive as the band's sense of humor. <br />I enjoyed some of the riffs on this record and if this was simply an instrumental record I would have given it 4 stars. As it stands however, the lyrics, lead vocals and choir backup leads me to believe that this band is hamming it up.
B00006690G|5.0|THIS IS CLEARLY EMINEM'S BEST ALBUM EVER.

THERE ARE A FEW WEAK SONGS, BUT I WILL NOT LIST THEM. BUT THE ONE THING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ILL WOULD TO HAVE HALIE ACTUALLY RAP ON THE SONG SHE'S FETURED ON.

B00003CX95|5.0|Didja ever notice that most of Mel Gibson's movies have the same premise: Nice moral guy is living a peaceful life with his family until some bad guy messes with/kills his family, then it's payback time for Mad Mel. We saw it in the original Mad Max, it's the underlying theme in the Lethal Weapon series, it's the engine that drives Braveheart and we got it again in The Patriot. There are other Gibson flics involving a mob debt and a kidnapped son that also follow the pattern. Mel's remake of Macbeth fits too.<BR>And then there's the problem of whether Braveheart has any historical merit. Of course it doesn't. Very little is known about William Wallace - certainly not enough to make an accurate movie of this length and scope - and some of what is known got twisted around a bit in the interest of cenematic storytelling.<BR>All that said, I have to confess I love this movie. This film probably represents the high water mark of Mel's Success Formula. The good guys are lovable and the bad guys are deliciously evil and malignant. When it comes to movies about righteous underdog Scots hacking the arrogant English to hamburger, it just doesn't get any better than Braveheart.<BR>Just remember: get your entertaiment at the movies and your history out of books.

B000065U1N|4.0|I recently bought Black Hawk Down on DVD, and it was another Ridley Scott masterpiece. The first Scott movie I saw was Gladiator and it got me hooked. Black Hawk Down is very similar to Gladiator, in many ways, such as music and the bloody battles. The only movie that is bloodier than BHD and Gladiator is Saving Private Ryan.<br />There were many subplots, I especially enjoyed McGregors, a soldier who wants to fight in \\"The Mog\\" and gets a little more than he bargins for when he goes into battle.<br />The reason I gave BHD 4 stars is when I went to the trailers, there was none for the feature movie. It had Spider Man and The One. This only one minor complaint for an excellent movie. Keep it up Ridley.

B00000K0DK|2.0|I am 40 years old and watched this for the first time a few days ago;saw it at the library and wanted to finally view what everyone considers the movie of all movies. Honestly, I do not see what the big hype is about. It just wasn't that great. Sure, it contains some good filming and lighting techniques, and symbolism, but overall the story was boring to me. I guess I am not interested in newspaper men and polititians. I felt the story could have been more developed. It was one of those movies where I was falling asleep near the end, wondering when it would be over. Throughout my life in various ways I have heard of the \\"Rosebud\\" thing and what it referred to. Now I got to see what it was all about. But I guess I felt the movie didn't really tell me why those were his dying words, why after all these years, Rosebud meant so much to him. Maybe I am just missing something here?? Anyway, it's definately not a film I will watch again. Personally, I find Alfred Hitchcock was a much better filmmaker than Orson Welles.
0788812807|5.0|although this is not considered by me to be a classic (i didnt see it till i was a bit older), it is a wonderfully put together movie. as a little girl i liked to see the grand houses of the pets, this movie shows alot of that and has great animation and a good story line.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|This drastically under publicised classic is mos def one to watch, this blade/preditor 2 cross combines all the classic acting talent of blade (wesley snipes) and whistler (kris kristofferson) aswell as adding new actors such as reinhardt (ron pearlman-aliens ressurection)to spice up an already impressive cast. this truly brilliant film is a new type of hybrid cross of films to lead the way in the film industry, up there with the greats such as the matrix, and boys in the hood etc etc. the soundtrack does not reflect the film as many songs where left off the album (in fact, all the good ones were) so dont be disheartened. this truly brilliant, blood ridden, fast, action packed film will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way thru and will keep you begging for more vampire violence in the form of mass masacres. mos def one to watch. dont miss its release!!!

B00003CXAE|5.0|There seems to be only two kinds of reviews for Grease 1) from those who love movie musicals or 2) from those who loved the stage production.<br />Well this review is from someone who saw this movie when it was first released. I was 10 years old and in New York City on vacation with my uncle. It was opening day for Grease and we decided to go see it. I couldn't tell you what movie theatre it was in, but it was one of those old great movie theatres that actually had character: art decco decor, sticky floors, and the ghosts of generations of movie goers...<br />I loved Grease (this from an avid hater of movie musicals: bad music and worse acting; give me a Shostakovich string quartet or a Mahler symphony any day!). Grease was magical to me: the music was fun fun fun, John Travolta was at his very best (when I'm 90 years old if you mention the name John Travolta I will always picture him as he was in Grease), and Olivia Newton-John was cute as pie. This from a kid who saw Star Wars the year before over 40 times in the movie theatre in 1977 (and lets not forget the Great  James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me and the awesome WWII movie A Bridge Too Far). I still have my record of the Grease Soundtrack I bought at the time (of course no turntable to play it on).<br />I can say that I haven't seen Grease as many times as I have seen the original Star Wars movie, but I probably have seen it more times than any other movie besides Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark (okay I have seen the original Star Wars over 300 times and Raiders of the Lost Ark almost as much - not that we'll see those two movies on DVD before the next millenium). Grease is truly one of the purist movie experiences you'll ever have. Great music, and actors who are having fun and not taking everything too seriously.<br />Pure fun. A classic movie made during the golden age of movies...the 70s silly!<br />So nowadays you have the gaudy Moulin Rouge with a Jedi and Nicole Kidman making me cringe. I'll take the sweetness of Olivia Newton-John and the \\"Welcome Back Kotter\\" John Travolta every single time!take the sweetness of Olivia Newton-John and the \\"Welcome Back Kotter\\" John Travolta every single time!
0385720920|2.0|I've also read Fight Club and Invisible Monsters.  When I picked up Fight Club, I considered it one of the most interesting thought-provoking novels I had read. Invisible Monsters was a disappointment, but I wanted to give Palahniuk the benefit of the doubt.  <br />With Choke, Chuck Palahniuk disappints and rehashes familiar thematic territory.  With his newest protagonist Vincent Mancini, we have another character with an addictive personality who does not fit in with society at-large.  Vincent is placed in series of absurd situations both in the present and through flashbacks into the past.  Finally, Vincent is figuratively reborn into society, accepting life for what it is.  All of this should be very familiar to readers of his previous books.<br />To his credit, Palahniuk is very creative in generating scenes and situations.  As usual, they are quite amusing especially those involve Vincent's insane hippie mother.  Okay for a quick read, but there just isn't enough thought-provoking material in the novel for me to recommend it.
0312265859|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the Stephanie Plum series. And I was very anxious to run out and buy Hard Eight right when it came out. I even had its release date marked on my calendar. The reviews said that it was a little darker than the other books, and that this book helped Janet Evanovich avoid falling into a rut with her plotlines. But I don't really see much of a difference between this and all the other Stephanie Plum novels. She still has people breaking into her apartment. She still has her cars blown up. Her Grandma is still as crazy as ever. She's still kind of inept at the bounty hunter thing. She still doesn't like carrying her gun. It's just more of the same Stephanie Plum that's been in all the previous books. Except that she finally \\"repays her debt\\" to Ranger in this novel instead of just talking about it. But the whole encounter was anticlimatic (no pun intended!), and didn't seem worth all the build up. For those die hard Stephanie Plum fans out there, this book doesn't disappoint. But if you're looking for something new and fresh, it doesn't really deliver.
0800177177|5.0|Generally I am not big on horror films or gore-fests. I do not consider this a gore-fest. It is however one of the horror films I like a lot. I remember reading the novel DRACULA as a young boy and feeling a chill and an excitement all the way through. This film captured that for me.<BR>     What more can I say? The actors and actresses involved all sank their teeth into their roles with relish (pun intended) and it showed. Gary Oldman did a terrific job of not only giving us the typical \\"monstrous\\" side of Dracula but also depicting the tortured anguish of a man who has lost the woman he loves, has endured CENTURIES without her, and would do almost anything to get her back. That would drive most people mad I think, being without the one they cherish most. They do say love overpowers everything and it's evident here. Anthony Hopkins gave us a Van Helsing appropriately scholarly and wise, while also a bit goofy and amusing. Keanu Reeves was good  as Jonathan Harker too, appropriately reserved, seeming just like a normal man who thrust into extraordinary circumstances. All the other actors and actresses were very good in their roles as well and were very interesting to watch. If Hopkins and Oldman had switched roles, it COULD have been VERY interesting but I think they made the right choice with Oldman as Dracula and Hopkins as Helsing.<BR>     The sets and costuming were all exquisite and grand here, giving a real feel of 19th century England and ancient Transylvania. Castle Dracula in particular stood out but EVERYTHING had a sense of grandeur, of mystery, of danger waiting to strike in a time and place you didn't expect it. The things just plain looked good. The music perfectly captured the mix in the story of danger, foreboding and the tenderness of a love lost, yearned for and rekindled.<BR>     As I said before this is NOT as gory as most horror or slasher flicks out today. It IS however the bloodiest and most sexually explicit and graphic of all Dracula films to date (except maybe Wes Craven's Dracula 2000 but I did not see that film and frankly I have no interest in that film at all.) There are things that make me really love this film. For the first time we get an idea of WHY Dracula became a vampire and how. (Love can drive a person to do crazy things after all, but in their mind they are worth it). We get a Dracula who is not JUST a monster(He is seen telling Mina \\"I cannot let this be. I love you too much to condemn you\\"). Also the killing of Dracula in this film is (mostly) accurate according to the novel. He was NEVER stabbed through the heart with a stake, shot with silver bullets, submerged in running water, or exposed to too much sunlight. (The novel DOES have him being stabbed through the heart with a big knife at the same instant as another knife cuts off his head. Mina striking the death blow here at a time shortly after the initial stabbing of Dracula by Johnathan Harker and Quincy P. Morris was likely done to give it the feel of a \\"mercy\\" killing. That worked just fine for me too and made his death mean more somehow to me.)<BR>    To make a long story short, I liked this film for it's visual style, it's overall ambiance, and for the fact that it gave us a Dracula who could and DID love, who was both monster and man, villian and tragic figure, ALMOST a kind of tragic hero if you want to go that far. The climax with Dracula begging and receiving the mercy of Jesus struck home with me. It made it all worthwhile to see. It was already a great film and that made it even better. In short, this thing had heart that no other Dracula film in history has had. That alone makes it a modern classic in my book. Enjoy it. You just might learn to love it. I certainly did. Peace.
0553801481|5.0|Finally! After years of living the quiet life he always thought he wanted FitzChivalry Farseer is called back to his duty to his country in Robin Hobb's (also known as Megan Lindholm) latest book. Fitz, unable to reveal his true identity to the majority of his childhood world, now goes by Tom Badgerlock (the surname referring to that nice white patch Regal gave him). I won't give away too much, but I strongly recommend that anyone who hasn't read the Farseer trilogy do so, followed by the Madship tilogy, before reading The Tawny Man (hey, you're the lucky guys; you'll have something to fill the endless moments 'till Golden Fool is released!). Plus, anyone who hasn't read the Madship trilogy should also do that; there're some clues in those books as to what we'll be seeing--and some interesting possibilities for Fitz's discovery!<BR> Okay, so this book, as all her other books, is very well written, with a realistic approach to a... an adventurous imagination? All I can say is (if you haven't figured it out yet...), this book is EXCELLENT.<br />         BRAVO, ROBIN--MEGAN--WHATEVER.<BR>                <BR>                    BRAVO!!!
B00005RD9B|5.0|The only difference between this album and the regular version is that this CD has 1 extra track - Pictures Of You.<br />A lot of Cure fans love this song, but i feel it is extremely overrated, and they should have added Fascination Street (from Disintegration) or something from Pornography instead.<br />If you are just getting into the Cure, instead of buying The Greatest Hits collection, go all out and grab \\"Standing On A Beach\\" (The singles from 1978-1986) and \\"Galore\\" (the singles from 1987-1997).  These two collections have a much broader range of styles and songs, and even Robert Smith himself said that the Greatest Hits was a poor representation of what the Cure stood for.<br />However, I suggest the best way to get into the Cure are through the ACTUAL ALBUMS and not the collections.  Most Cure fans agree \\"Faith\\", \\"Pornography\\", \\"Top\\", \\"Disintegration\\", \\"Wish\\" and \\"Bloodflowers\\" are among the best, but \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" is very under-rated.  Heck - if you count them all up, The Cure has around 17 CD's.. (that includes studio albums, a remix album, the 2 single collections, the greatest hits, and live albums)<br />But back to the greatest hits... if you feel you MUST buy it,  make sure you get the version with the ACOUSTIC SONGS on the second disc, because they are absolutely amazing. (they were the reason I got the greatest hits in the first place!) Dont worry that this version has 1 extra song.<br />And on a final note, it is dissapointing the greatest hits album doesnt have anything from Pornography, Faith, Bloodflowers and Top,  all excellent albums!
B00003CXAE|5.0|This is the first movie that I went to see more than once. I was 11 years old... It's been 22 years after that and I was still wondering why the dvd was not around. Thank you for making me live it again...
0684847817|3.0|I purchased the original Faeries book during the first printing.  I really enjoyed it so I purchased this book to finish off the &quot;collection&quot;.  I liked the first book better.  The art work in the Good Faeries, Bad Faeries, is very similar to what is in the first book.  Some of it is so close that I had to pull out the original book to see the differences.  If you're looking for a creative new book by Brian Froud, this isn't it.  It's a poor imitation of the original Faeries, nothing new or creative here.
