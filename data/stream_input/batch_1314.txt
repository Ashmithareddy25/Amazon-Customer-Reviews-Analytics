B0054JZC6E|4.0|idk... the games are kind of weird, some are so cheaply made, others are creative and well done. overall the games are addicting and you just want to beat the scores to get points and unlock new games whether you enjoy the game at hand or not. the controls are kinda screwy and sometimes make the games impossible to play. its not my favorite app but its over 100 games for free, so I still recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got this game just beacse I was bored and now this is all I play now it is worth the time it takes to download
B0055SWM08|4.0|Quell is addicting and challenging. To have more levels would be nice because it's very easy to finish the game very quickly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty fun game. it changes every time so it never gets old. some games are more for small kids its a fun app
B004FOA84A|3.0|This was starting out to be a fun puzzle game, however it was the shortes game I have ever played.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has been fun for the whole family. I have not had to update it yet. so have not had some of the problems others have.
0525478817|5.0|Very rarely a book comes along that changes my life. This book is one of those books. If you've ever felt that the world is an overwhelmingly awful place, this book will remind you of the good in it without falling into sickly sweet cliches.  Read. It.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is easy to use and always correct. You can set multiple cities which is good for vacations and working in another city. Very helpful with children to know if there will be enough snow to cancel school.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok but some games are boring and don't make me want to play them again I think its pretty good
B004MC8CA2|5.0|With the busy life we live today, this is a great way to read the bible daily. It has a reminder setting. I love it. I highly recommend this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's a lot of fun but I think it needs to be more generous with the points, with later games costing way more points it takes forever to unlock
B006JPS1OM|5.0|just finished first course - like it already!  graphics are lifelike and it is easy to follow.  some hidden games leave you wondering what to do next with no help.
0307888681|5.0|My son liked this book so well he started reading it on Christmas Day.Now that he has finished it he is going to read it all over again..Says it is really a great book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. when you're bored at work, whip this out and it will entertain. I highlyrecommend.
0312370849|4.0|This book tells a remarkable and deeply sad story of the   early 1920's in France.  It begins with the French  police rounding  up Jewish people in Paris and surrounding areas. They are taken  to prison camps and ultimately killed. This particularly story is written  about two young  girls that escape, and the trials and tribulations of the  rest of their lives....  Their suffering breaks your heart  and you must continue to find out the rest of the story.  It pulls you in and  you must finish it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a nice game to kill time. the one thing I do not like are the ads that pop up after every deal. other than that its a great game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun I enjoy the games alt of mind strategy and just for fun games.  Aldo traces u to manage ur money well
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have improved my ability to keep my commitments because my notes and action items are with me all the time. When I'm in the office I log my call and meeting notes on my laptop, in the field I use my tablet, and then I can bring any note up anywhere in 5 clicks or less using my phone.  I have never been so organized before.  This is the solution I have been looking for!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|When I first got this app, it worked like a charm. easy to use and navigate but then amazon made an update for it and now it wont open. I have tried to trouble shoot on my own with no luck. I wish the tech people would get it working again :o(
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I tried Swype, stock and other keyboards on my Galaxy Nexus, until I locked out and got this app as the free app of the day. I love the prediction feature and the multiple languages support. I wish there was a way to switch languages which would improve predictions.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Being a southerner, this movie address many issues of race still prevalent today and should be a source of shame for many whites of privilege still living this way. The same thing is going on now but Mexican Women are raising white children more than blacks. Sadly, the south is still the south and that will never change. I'm treated different when I'm out in public w/my husband and mixed children in the south than when I go out in public alone. Not so in the west. This is sickening in 2012.<br /><br />The movie is good and inspiring. It's good to see the women gain a voice through writing a book about what they had to endure to make a living. I wish there was the same sense of justice in reality.<br /><br />I don't care for Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard in any roll (or role) so this makes her an even better villaness.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|A live concert and a \\"behind the music\\" all in one. She is a great storyteller and an even better performer.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|It was a Christmas present for a zombie fan.  He seemed pleased to get it.  I'm not sure if he has watched it yet or not so I can't say how he liked it, though I've heard from other fans that it's worth a watch.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|Believing that he had \\"written too many love ballads\\", Morrison has produced a very interesting follow-up to his 2008 release. \\"The Awakening\\" at first will sound a bit strange for those who are familiar with his prevous work (as it did for me). Most of these songs are growers, they don't catch you the moment you hear them. In fact, the opener \\"In My Dreams\\" sounds almost shallow at first. But Morrison always manages to surprise us. The Michael Jackson inspried, upbeat single \\"Slave to the Music\\" and the highly personal, raw-sounding \\"Person I Should Have Been\\" are some of his best songs yet. Another highlight on the record is the harmonious duet with Jessie J, \\"Up\\", which to me is superior to his previous duet with Nelly Furtado. His usual gorgeous horn/guitar/vocal arrangements, on this record, come out slick and smooth and that just works. Sometimes, less is more. And yet, the soulful backing vocals on the guitar ballad \\"Right By Your Side\\", the stampede of drums on the title track and the catchy na-na-na's on \\"Beautiful Life\\" give his music a new personality, being qualities that have somehow are newfangled to his sound. Little by little, he shows us what he's after and in my opinion he suceeds. This is the real James Morrison.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Each Bible book from Genesis to Revelation is introduced with a short outline of its' content, thus helping the reader to get a better feel for the Bible characters and their roles in the Scriptures. One is drawn closer to their Creator through a better understanding of his wonderful purposes in the pages of his Word, the Holy Bible.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star is because sometimes the &quot;hint&quot; does not give you a correct move. other than that its great. I like how you can change the deck to a personal pic.
1594744769|4.0|Well, I ordered the book and it never came...still hasn't. So I emailed the saler and he was very nice and sent me one overnight express shipping.   The book came in perfect condition- Brand new.   As far as the book, I'm still in the process, but it is very interesting !
0064430227|5.0|My 4 1/2 YO son found this story to be a little boring but surprisingly my 2YO daughter with attention issues is very engaged in this book and enjoys \\"guessing' what Harold will draw next.  I appreciate the simple drawings and pictures for a child her age that has trouble focusing.
0316098329|5.0|This book was recomended to me by my aunt, and I thought it sounded interesting from her brief summary, though I was wary of a sad ending. As I read on I discovered that Room is a perfect mix of all different kinds of emotions. The ending was just about perfect, and I can appreciate Emma Donoghue as one of my new favoite authors.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|My 3 year old loves this app and has a lot of fun playing and learning withit, but it freezes when she plays in the gallery section.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|I really enjoy playing manning &amp; when I seen the app for it I bought it for the $.99 instead of getting the free app (thought it may be better). This freezes on kits own &amp; for no reason and quits the game right in the middle! At first I thought it was something I was doing to cause this-found out its the app!!! Wish they would fix it VERY soon-otherwise its challenging.
B003EYVXUU|3.0|Original:  real snow.<br /><br />This remake:  fake snow (and it shows).<br /><br />Original:  spooky without showing the effort.<br /><br />This remake:  the effort shows.<br /><br />Winner:  The original in a landslide.  BUT.... if you rent/watch/purchase the original, be sure it is the one with \\"English Theatrical\\" subtitles --the subtitles as originally shown in the theaters.  The original set of subtitles the home video release of LTROI was different and demonstrably inferior.  Details matter.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|When I read it I can literally feel the holy spirit moving through me I love this app :) God &lt;3 everybody
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a lot of fun but its hard to get all the points. But its fun. I really like it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|As a younger player and just starting out I'm having lots of fun. I was frustrated at first because I dint know where to find the rules. I did and ot really into the games. Have the younger kids watch me and play to is fun. Some games are difficult and I don't get but the ones I do under stand are the best! I think its about playing on your own time and collecting points as you go, adding another game when you can. Its fun, and I can waist time on this. I only have a problem with the adds, there a lot of them,some.of the controlled are tricky and takestime to master.I haven't played that long but, I cant wait to contuine. I will take everyones advise on the upgrade I will finish this one first, then get the upgrade if there a new one out at the time.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Glad I purchased this Christmas gift from Amazon; I received this DVD/CD delivered as promised. The Adele concert DVD is awesome and my husband and I really enjoyed watching this quality production!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this has many fun little games to play. I really enjoy it!! I recommend this if you don't feel like downloading many games.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I was pleased to see a familiar face amongst The game apps for my new Kindle-Fire. Game performs flawlessly as I have come to expect from Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game so so so so so so so much it is super awesome and I love it
B005UDD1R6|1.0|it won't play my windows media videos and it can't even find my itunes videos. why approve an app that only does things the device can do fine without apps?
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app. It does all that it says it does. all data is always accurate. The severe weather alerts are sent in a timely manner.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is fun until you are stuck on a game you hate....I really like this because it helpspass the time!! One of the  best games ever!!!!!!!:)
B005DOL0R0|3.0|The Zip sleeve is stylish, and has enough room to make it an easy fit.  No problems with it, however, for what it is, it seems a bit pricey.  Since no other ones were available, and having a tablet without a case is suicidal, there wasn't much of a choice.  I suspect Walmart will shortly have cases in stock that are much less expensive.
B0052GACNM|4.0|I just wanted to know what people wanted for christmas so i got the CD there nothing else about this product at this time
B000000P17|4.0|You can never go wrong with Guns N' Roses. It's a must have for your complete collection. One of my favorites!
0553804677|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but it felt a bit slow up until the middle.  It wasn't until you met the story's main antagonist, the Grey King, half way through, that the book actually got good.  Before that, it was just Locke running around doing his business and character background information.    I will admit that the ending was a bit disappointing.  It was a bit over the top.  The ending is a bit like cheesy action movies where the actors takes 50 bullets, 200 stab wounds and multiple beatings and yet somehow has to strength to get one good hit on his enemy and lives to tell his tale.  I'd recommend this book but I wouldn't would it on the top of your list, maybe towards the middle.  For a very good fantasy series, I recommend the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson.  Oh and one more thing, for those of you looking for magic, there isn't much in this book.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|This movie is a must have for any fan of Pearl Jam! The scenes and videos really capture the time perfectly!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I LOVE this app!! The reading plans and daily devotionals are great. Having this on my kindle is much more convenient and the daily reminders keep me on track.
B005V2S7FW|2.0|sad... love lastpass on my other devices but it appears to be useless for the Silk browser.  not going to pay $1a month for this
B004EBZX6W|4.0|The only thing I think it missed and I wish it could be able to be updated soon is to examine your current WiFi but it not. It's still keep on the previous WiFi which was analyzing before. So you have to manually change the name to start detect your current WiFi which you are using.
031603441X|4.0|Fascinating stuff for any Stones/Keith fan. It glossed over or seemed to leave out a lot, but understandably Mr. Richards has had a very long and interesting life and career. He could easily do another book and concentrate on the deatils of the songs and albums, as well his bandmates. Other than Mick, he seems to not delve into his relationships with the other Stones. He should be more upfront about his complicated relationship with Brian Jones, confront the thing, not ignore it.
075666733X|5.0|the book is perfect for my needs as a nursing student. The large illustrations and definitions are perfect for those needing a reference book that they can quickly access and see the anatomy.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|well I thought it was for older kids but it isn't it is for like 1 year olds I got through all of the levels in like two seconds
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I've always thought UK singers had dynamic voices, Adele continues the trend with her '21' album.  The rhythms, modulations, and poetic lyrics -- simply phenomenal.  Adele is not some painted pop culture mold like many American stars tend to be.  Instead she's without question has sealed legacy as a terrific singer and songwriter that has built the bridges to make hers one of pop's greatest voices.  I appreciate every song on this album, not one song is disliked.  Seriously people if you are thirsty for real music don't miss out here, Adele is the real deal!
B001DPHDCY|4.0|This is a cute video, I ordered it for a 1 year old, which is indeed a bit too young for it, but he will grow into it. Older kids will enjoy it alot, I think. I also ordered the stuffed Horton on this site, to put with the video, they made for a cute present. This video is the not too scary one, there is another one with same name, I think that is a bit much for younger kids, but that is just my humble opinion.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this.game it keeps me entertained for hours and I have not had this game very long it rocks
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great! I was really impressed with the game. it is fun and a fun say to waste time. I.love it!
B004HGBUVG|2.0|I have been listening to the brilliance of Lucinda Williams since  before I had a CD player. Her early work was like Dylan's, her voice was  an acquired taste but her songs, like Vic Chesnutt's, were from a  completely unique perspective, literate, but gritty like folk art.    With the exception perhaps of Little Honey her last 4 albums have seen  a tremendous slide in quality-Blessed is filled with so many singer-songwriters Cliches that it is embarrassing for a man of my musical education to  listen to, yes there are a few good songs BUT...    I used to think that her throw-away songs were better than most other  singer-songwriters best work but now the bulk of her work sounds like toss-offs.    I suggest Laura Marling's The Beast or Gillian Welch's The Harrow &  The Harvest over this snoozer. If you think this is a 5 star album you  would have to adjust your star rating scale to 15 stars to accommodate  Car Wheels On A Gravel Road or Essence.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app and it has become me sidekick everywhere I go. Would recommend it any day. No need to carry a heavy Bible when you have this...
B0055SWM08|5.0|elegant look and feel... simple rules with various levels of challenge. recommended for all. some puzzles may be a bit easy but striving to get perfect the first time adds to the fun.
B005KJZDXK|3.0|After listening to the past records, Volume I and II. She&him's music becomes one of the parts of my life. When this album released, I bought it immediately from Target. After the first time I listen to it, unfortunately the only songs that I've  deep memories are \\"Christmas Waltz\\"& \\"Sleigh Ride\\". After Sleigh Ride, hardly some songs can attract you. And M.Ward needs to sing more with Zooey, he's so talented, but in this album I barely hear his voice. Zooey sure is the lead vocal, but \\"She\\" can't always go alone without \\"him\\". But those two songs I mentioned before are really smooth and touching, and the design of the cover and the cute envelope are really nice. A good album, but compares with the two past ones, needs some improvements.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is addictive and works great with the Kindle Fire. Graphics are great and easy to play. Wonderful game all in all. I have been extremely happy with it.
B0013FNC38|4.0|I obviously bought this album just because \\"I'm yours\\" & \\"Lucky\\", and after listened this album, I don't really have that much of feeling of the other songs. But after I played it more, I started to like all of them. Those songs never get bored! Awesome album!
B000JBWWRY|3.0|This item was a little disappointing since he had some \\"glitches\\" while watching it.  It was a gift to my grandson in Ca., so I took my son's word for this.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|If you loved Captain America comics, you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Firstly think 'the curious case of Benjamin Button'. This is how I saw the transition of Steve Rogers (a very small skinny guy) into Captain America - a fairly large muscular guy. Obviously a lot of computer work went on here. Although all very well done, there was still something slightly disturbing about this transition.<br /><br />The anomaly that sort of diminished this movie is that it is set in the 1940s, yet the technology seems to be on-par, or exceeds what we have today - ray guns that can vaporize an entire human in a single shot. This begs the question, why more like Captain America were not made, and how come over a period of 70 years we have not been able to perfect and replicate this kind of technology.<br /><br />Putting aside these issues... The acting and the movie as a whole is entertaining. Hugo Weaving puts on an excellent performance as the bad guy. Another weird thing about this movie was the idea of the US Army using their most combat ready soldier for musicals and cheap entertainment. Very strange ... but I suppose they had to have some filler to make up the time, so that it would be a full movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app has not given me any problems. I would like to be able to see more. this has no issues thus far
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. Runs very smooth for my kindle fire. Definitely worth the download. works great on the kindle fire.  Ieould have bought it if it was not free.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Saw this in the theatre. Emerged saying, \\"Wow.\\" Very slow moving... just like a long baseball season. I can't imagine this story winning over anyone who isn't already a serious fan of the game... but for those of us who are, for those of us who haul ourselves to games regardless of weather, losing streaks or our other commitments, for those of us who absolutely love baseball, this is probably the best baseball history movie ever made. As we watch it, we journey through the season that completely changed the history of the game. We get an inside peek, accurate or not, of the birth of the style of management that now dominates professional baseball. Bonus: Brad Pitt steps completely out of his stereotype and delivers one of his best performances yet. This movie deserves a number of Best Picture and Best Actor nods.  On a side note, if you like the behind the scenes realism of this movie, you will also probably like the movie Sugar, chronicling a typical experience of a Dominican MiLB player. Check it out!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This Uno game works great for my kindle fire. It works just as good as the PS3 version. Very smooth and clean.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you enjoy traditional Klondike Solitaire, then this version is the one for you. The controls are simple and the action is easy.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|I bought this to use with my 6th-gen iPod nano at the gym. I have the Nano on a [[ASIN:B004FEEZKI rubber watch band]], which is handy for fussing with which song is playing while you're running. As other reviewers have mentioned, it does suck the Nano's battery dry with great efficiency -- I have to charge the Nano every day or two.  There are two ameliorable cons to this setup:  1. The behind-the-head part of the Motorola 305S is in the way when bench pressing, and the around-the-ear part becomes uncomfortable after an hour or so. I'm going to try a [[ASIN:B004BW74DO GOgroove AirBand]] instead.  2. I wear the Nano on my left arm, with the volume and power buttons pointing toward my wrist. When worn in combination with weight-lifting gloves, the wrist of the glove sometimes mashes into the power button on the Nano while I'm changing the weights on a machine in just the wrong manner and shuts off the Nano. I have to wear the watch band further up my arm a bit to prevent this.  All in all, this is a great setup, far preferable to my previous method of clipping the Nano to the neck of my shirt (changing the current song made me cross-eyed) and threading the headphone wires through the straps of my sports bra to keep them from flapping around. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't drain the battery on the Nano with such verve.
0240808452|5.0|I purchased this book to coincide with a figure drawing class I was taking and it greatly improved my gestural drawings. Since then, I often receive compliments over the fluidity and gestrue of my art and I have this book to thank. His explanations on line of action and straight to curve are easy to understand and the illustrations show you rather then tell you. This book is not about spending long hours drawing pretty pictures. This is for animators or even comic book illustrators, who want to inject more life into their work, but are not sure where to start.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I started out with the lite version of this app and was really impressed, but a lot of the sounds I wanted weren't available.  I went ahead and bought this one and I don't regret it at all!  I really like the feature that you can play up to 3 sounds together to get that perfect harmony of noises that suits you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is a great and fun games. it is free and fun. I this game everyday.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a good deal lots of fun games and stuff the a boo baa Fred. cant plus me and you
B004FOA84A|1.0|I know this game was only a buck but, I have played better games that were longer for free. I am vary disaponted.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its so cool and its filled with so much. you will have fun and its addictive. this is a reallygood game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|when I first bought it I did not think it would be good cause its free but actually its the best app out there for free
B005ZUR724|5.0|I feel bad for those who cannot play, its the same.concept as WoW except you don't have to worry about your computer not being good enough. its smooth and fun, only complaint is that sometimes as a ranger I can kill monsters that are way beyond my level before they even touch me, I need a challenge! lol
B004VD3YIM|5.0|this app is 100% (TRUE)!!! I went to a camera and saw my self true true true true true true true and trusting to all for every one!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this app was kind of a rip off. Yah, don't buy this app unless you understand that it only starts with like 10 minute long games.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great game it just takes forever to unlock games and remember to not update because j will loose all of ur games u unlocked!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It's a very fun AND frustrating game~ makes you want to keep trying! I am glad I upgraded to the add-free version.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It syncs with my Pc, iphone and my kindle fire. Great app with awesome features. Would pay for this but it's freeeeee!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful. I love the variety of study plans available and that you can choose by topic. Great way to study the Bible.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|I tried my best to love this album.  I really did.  But, I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  \\"Dani California\\" and \\"Snow\\" are phenomenal pieces of work, fusing together rock and roll and other genres together; however, as a unit, this album is really the epitome of unremarkable.  No, it's not bad.  By any means, but it simply does not give a pleasurable listening experience, unlike [[ASIN:B0011Z78NK Californication (Bonus Tracks)]] which as an album was much preferable.  To be honest, the best way I gauge an album is the play counts in iTunes.  Right now, excluding \\"Dani California\\" and \\"Snow\\", which can both be bought separately, I've listened to each song maybe two times.  That's not for lack of wanting to try them, but more out of sheer displeasure at them.  Compare this to Californication, which I've heard all the way through dozens of time, and you can see just how this album was far too overhyped.  It's not unpleasant, but it certainly isn't anywhere near as good as I had expected.
0525423656|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Crossed.  After reading Matched I wasn't sure I wanted to continue the series and read the second book.  The first book was a little too much focused on the relationships betweeen Cassia and the two boys...I got bored with it.  I am glad I went ahead with Crossed because I thought it was a much better read.  Way more interesting.  I loved it!  Well developed settings and different characters made the second book an interesting read.  I highly recommend this book and can't wait for the third.
B00000J7JO|4.0|This album is one of those which I put in my car radio for months on end.  This album is entirely a beautiful mixture of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' own distinct flavor of rock n'roll which makes them quite a separate beast from other bands.  \\"Scar Tissue\\" and \\"Californication\\" both set the tone of the album in different ways.  The former compels the listener with long, poetic verses, each one flowing smoothly into one another, reminiscient of a more folk-ish way of writing.  On the other hand, \\"Californication\\" is written more in the style of a slow Guns N'Roses song, with catchy, well-produced hooks gleaming with polishing touches.  Songs like \\"I Like Dirt\\" and \\"Parallelz Universe\\" demonstrate the band's more rough roots via the inclusion of a more harsh beat, that is less soothing.  Overall, this album is solid,  and it is slightly remarkable as a whole work, yet most of the individual songs are only slightly above average, with a few blockbusters thrown in for good measure.
B005KA188S|5.0|great horror sequial,makes oringnal look like a kids commedy flick.so glad to see matt tenatet[dr who s2 thur 5]thinkmake it into movies and in this movie he carries some of that chateter with him beautiful roll for him,just pops up when you least expect him,and all other actors though unfamiarler except ferell.do the movie justice,recomend to all comidic horror movies fans ececpt expect some real horrific secens,it made me clime my chair.dkg
B00005QIPH|5.0|First off, I have a brief confession to make.  I bought this album after hearing one song, \\"Last Night\\" on Pandora.  After hearing it, I knew I just had to have it.  I can honestly say that decision was one of my best.  Is This It combines so much folk and electronic and rock and roll genres all into one incredible composition.  Each song has its own melody and format, and they all are able to capture the listener's attention with great ease.  For example, there are countless nuances present in each track, and the lyrics alone are fascinating, with highly creative words employed.    For me, \\"Last Night\\" and \\"Someday\\" still steal my heart with folk-esque beats and melodies on this album, but songs such as \\"Alone, Together\\" show the Strokes' truly versatile musical style, giving to the listener a sense of hard rock, almost bordering on light metal type stuff, far from the whimsical nature of \\"Someday\\" which it follows.   Overall, if you have to buy one album to cover folk and rock, Is This It makes a very compelling case for doing just that.
0756404746|4.0|Reading this book is like reading \\"The Fellowship of The Rings\\" by Tolkien - the book ends in the middle of the story; the story is spread over at least 3 books (and only two are out so far).  So if you don't like being left hanging, buy the book and wait for the sequels to be published before you start it!  I thought I'd mention this, as I just read it, thinking it would come to a conclusion (at least like the Harry Potter books), but it just stops mid-plot, which was rather frustrating.    That said, it's a pretty darn good book.  It's got a lot of things going for it - it's serious but with plenty of humor, well written and literate but at the same time a quick and easy read.  The main character is likeable enough, although a bit arrogant.  The plot of this book is basically a back story of the protagonist's childhood which he's telling to someone, so there's a few chapters that take place \\"now\\" while most of it is in the past.  The overview reads like the plot of Harry Potter:  his family is attacked by the feared and mysterious \\"dark lord\\", and he has a rough childhood before going to wizarding school, where he excells beyond everyone else.  It's not a total ripoff, but it's certainly similar!  It also kind of reminds me of Sanderson, Jordan, as well as my favorite fantasy reads from high school (David Eddings, Piers Anthony).  Although I don't think he's as good as LeGuin, Tolkien, or even Sanderson, it's a pretty good book, and I shot through the 700+ pages in less time than it often takes me to read a book less than half the size.  But, if I'd known it'd leave me hanging, I might've waited before reading it! (And it took about 4 years to release book 2, so it may be another 3 yet before the series finishes).
B003HARV98|5.0|Few artists have the same degree of eccentricity in the modern world as Marina and the Diamonds.  On The Family Jewels, the band displayed this versatility in such a way as to demonstrate to the modern listener the singer's unique vocal ability to sound like nails on chalkboard, but in a good way.  Truly, Marina's voice in any other setting would sound quite horrid, but in these songs, her accompaniment softens the blow of her sharp voice, producing an almost surreal feeling.<br /><br />Songs like \\"I am not a Robot\\" and \\"Hollywood\\" illustrate her unique ability to use this vocal ability effectively.  However, picking any two songs truly does a disservice to the entire album, which is simply a remarkable listening experience as an album in its entirely.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I've seen all the Potter films, and really like the early ones.  Much of what I like about them is the \\"magic\\" - colorful costumes, magical creatures, Hogwarts (both the setting and the school atmosphere), and John Williams fantastic musical score.  Unfortunately, most of that is missing here.  The kids are on the run, so the whole Hogwarts school setting is absent from this film, and instead they spend most of their time in a drab tent, camping in the drab wilderness, dressed in really drab muggle clothes, in drab lighting (the whole movie seems to take place on an overcast day - don't try watching this when the sun is coming through your windows, or you won't be able to see much of the film!).  Sadly, they don't have John Williams doing the music for this one, and the composer chooses not to utilize Williams's iconic themes from the previous movies, leaving an important connection to the feel of the series out, and the music doesn't do anything to create a magical Harry Potter atmosphere.  Another major part of my enjoyment of the early films was the friendship between the 3 main characters (although there were tensions at times).  In this film, the characters are pretty much uptight the whole film, and their relationships are strained.  Although I understand the significance to the plot, this makes watching the movie more tense than relaxing for me. Also, an important part of the film is to show the frustration and lack of progress of the book - the film succeeds in this enough, but, like my previous criticism, I don't find feeling frustrated and like nothing's getting anywhere to be my idea of \\"good entertainment\\"!<br />  This is not to say this movie is terrible - just that I find it the least enjoyable of the series - it moves the plot along, and I'd certainly recommend it for someone working the way through the whole series, but I wouldn't recommend it as a stand-alone viewing experience.  On the bright side, there are plenty of good parts:  the initial scenewhere Harry leaves the Dursley house, the scene where they sneak into the Ministry of Magic, where they visit the Lovegoods' house, etc.  I guess, wherever they make it look like a magical world I enjoy it - I go to Harry Potter to see something different and magical, not to see the drabbest side of the everyday modern world; I can see that for free!
B000089CJI|5.0|The album itself is a sold collection of folk-like beats, in a slow melancholic fashion.  Songs such as \\"The District Sleeps alone Tonight\\" and \\"Sleeping In\\" highlight the album's ability to discuss dark topics with a bit of electric-synth style stuff thrown in as well.    The Postal Service truly gets to the heart of the matter by fusing together several different types of music into one gorgeous collection with velvety vocals and sweet, captivating melodies, this album provides something different in each track, giving the listener the ability to select as he or she pleases.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a must-see, extremely well done historical series worth every minute of viewing time. The acting and production quality are top-notch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read An Abundance of Katherines, Looking for Alaska, and Paper Towns, and this is John Green's best book yet. I loved it. This book will make you smile, laugh, and cry. It's witty and an enjoyable read. I highly recommend it. DFTBA <3
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love having the option to only play winning solitaire hands!  terrific option!  I also enjoy the comparison scores with other players.  I play on the kindle fire and the ui is stunning.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really good and the games aren't cheesy and stupid as expected. there are all very very different types of interesting games you can play.
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|First off, I want to do naughty things to Chris Evans. I dont think Ive ever seen him in a movie before, but hellooooo nurse! Im a fan of Anna Farris, so I knew the movie would definitely be better than those other GENERIC romantic comedies. It is quirky, odd, and just the right amount of wtf/omg! The only reason why I wont give it 5 stars is the rediculously outlandish \\"strip horse\\" scene.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very adicting game. lots of fun. I recomend this game for anyone that has lots of time on there hands.
0525478817|5.0|There are no words that can adequately describe my feelings about this book. Through every page John Green weaves his tale about 16 year old Hazel Grace Landcaster and 17 year old Augustus Waters with perfectly timed humor and profound thoughts. His work on The Fault in Our Stars is absolutely beautiful. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and even more importantly it will make you think - reflecting, on the real meaning of life. TFiOS is intellectual in it's construction and it's cast of characters will leave you amazed as it takes you on \\"a roller coaster ride that only goes up,\\" to quote the book.   Keep some tissues handy and get ready to enjoy this amazing book by an equally amazing author. The concept may be simple, but the story and the emotions that drive the characters are very deep and complex. It's brilliant. It's beautiful. It's profound. It's heart-warming. You simply can not go wrong with this book.
0525478817|5.0|I don't cry because of works of fiction. I have remained completely dry eyed through things that have left my friends balling their eyes out. Not so with this book. I am talking nose dripping, eyes puffy, face red kind of crying for the last forty pages. Not to sound cliche but at one point I was actually laughing and crying at the same time. I'm not good with words and I can't accurately describe the way this book made me feel so all I will say is this: Read it. Read it because it needs to be read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it so much and I love the games all the games are so cool and I love it so much
B003L77GRO|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, who is a hardcore Dexter fan! This season 5 dvd set made his collection current and up-to-date. He now has all 5 seasons out so far. He was very, very pleased!!

0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle has written a book that should be required reading for anyone serving or wanting to serve in today's military. If you want to know how the insurgency was beaten in Iraq read this book. Plainly written, brutally honest, heartfelt and devoid of a political agenda. Chief Kyle bares his soul and invites us even into the most private moments of his marriage to include passages written by his wife. He humbly downplays his accomplishments and gives due credit to his fellow warriors. He embodies the epitome of the American warrior spirit. My favorite quote in the book is by his fellow SEAL and buddy Ryan, \\"Despite what your mama told you, violence does solve problems.\\"  If you own a Kindle Fire or Nook Color you must order the Enhanced version of the book to get the embedded videos of Chris, in his own words. Bravo Zulu Chief! Thank you for your invaluable service to this nation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is extremely addicting and I luv it sooooooooooo much. it is awesome and I highly recomend it. get it now!!!!
B000V6I7WG|3.0|Ok, the film is a classic and deserves five stars. However, this blu ray is not a five star release by a long shot. The video quality is barely above dvd-level. I have compared with both Tartan's dvd and the director approved Starmax dvd edition. Surely the video is better on this disc but there is alot of grain and picture is quite fuzzy at times. Sound quality is however better and worth the upgrade. Extras are good but in standard def. So if you are a fan of this movie and want to own it on blu ray, wait for a better transfer that surely must come. Because this masterpiece needs a better treatment than it has gotten on this release.
B006C1DH92|5.0|got this app when it was the free app of the day, and it is absolutely our entire family's favorite app! we all play it (even my two yr old loves it) it is way better than the standard version of fruit ninja because rather than just having one game, it has multiple mini games in bandito mode. I would pay $5 for this app, I cant believe it's only 99 cents! you will not regret this purchase! works great on kindle fire!!!!!!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Very happy with the service!! Arrived quick and packaged well. Thank You. Would recommend to anyone.I would buy from you again.

B0054JZC6E|1.0|My own finger blocks the view, can't control that way. Poor industrial design. Too many ads, although you can easily skip or close.
B004G600A4|4.0|We saw this movie on Netflix first, I thought it was entretaining enough, but my kids(2&5)somehow LOVED it.  They especially liked the horse named Maximus.  He is such a spice to this movie indeed.  For kids' request, I bought a used dvd on Amazon, they enjoy watching it in the car as well.
B004LWZVZM|5.0|An excellent courtroom drama with all actors and actresses performing above and beyond what any director could even ask for.  The writing, directing, and sets for this movie are superb.  I truly felt like I was watching the events as they happened.  This is one of those films that really makes you think about how great our Constitution is and how much we must respect the judicial system we have in place.  This is a must-see or must-own movie if ever there was one.
B00067BBQE|5.0|After finding several videos of this tour on itunes, I had to have the complete digital source and the price was wonderful.  Nothing beats watching a concert on DVD and not on the PC.  Great value of full albumn and dvd of Paris concert.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is super fun. it has great variety to keep you interested.  only problem is its sometimes hard to collect points quickly to open new games.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  Each time you watch it, you catch new things you had never seen before!  It is filled with mystery, suspense, and of course...magic.  This movie takes some thinking to understand and appreciate, but once you understand everything...it might be one of the best movies you ever watch.  But you always have to ask yourself, \\"Are you watching closely?\\"
B006GKHE6G|5.0|This game is fantastic on KF. Graphics are outstanding and beautiful. Game play is very smooth and fast, and quite challenging in 1000cc races. I haven't had any gliches or crashes in the few hours of time I've put in so far. You can choose between tilt steering or touch steering (I much prefer the touch steering). So far, one of my favorite games on KF, behind Shadowgun of course :) Totally addicting and well worth the $2.99! Oh and regarding one reviewer who said that doing tricks during jumps is pointless, they are absolutely necessary to recharge your boost! Pull tricks whenever possible and boost boost boost to win!

B004MC8CA2|3.0|I can't download other translations for offline use. I can't be on wi-fi all the time. So I can't use the app in the pews.<br />(Kindle Fire version)<br />UPDATE: I eventually got the translation downloads working after a week or so of trying.  I think it required a restart, log-in/out, and some other steps.  Navigation is a bit clunky, but not bad.  The selection of translations is as good as it gets, unless you want to read the Greek too.  I would like if it were easier to switch back and forth between texts, similar to how you can just use the back button on Bible Gateway.  I also don't like how it requires internet access to use bookmarks and notes.  Overall this is the best bible app available for Android devices.
B0019N94X6|5.0|This review isn't so much on the quality of the movie, as it is the packaging and content.  I'm sure there's a basic scarface in a 5 dollar bin somewhere that has the same great movie somewhere, but this version is great.  I'm a big fan of special features and deleted scenes, and this does not disappoint.  Let's start with the case.  The metal case is very attractive, and comes packaged securely in bubble wrap.  Upon opening you'll find a package of cool looking art cards, and two discs.  The blu-ray version of this movie looks fantastic.  While you can only do so much to enhance the initial quality, I feel they did a great job making this look updated.  There a loads of special features that cover all aspects of the film.  At the time of purchase, I paid 14.99 for this item, and I feel that this is a tremendous value.  I would expect to pay at least 40 dollars for this package, and I probably would have.  If you're considering buying the movie, I'd suggest getting this edition
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its so awesome I love how you. have to ear points to. unlock the other games..
B001H9JBW6|5.0|I've become quite a Robert Carlyle fan from the new (American) TV show \\"Once Upon A Time\\"(OUAT). I purchased the Amazon instant video of OUAT for the season (really cool technology) and did a purchase of Season 1 of this series via the same mechanism, because Carlyle was in it. What a totally well done production - character, drama, intrigue and wonderful acting. So I just had to get the DVD too. The first episode made me crazy, trying to figure out who/what/when/why)<br /><br />And for all you OUAT fans: If you think Carlyle is good as \\"bad-maybe\\" Rumpel/Mr. Gold, you haven't met the character \\"David Russel\\". If you Carlyle fans want to experience cognitive dissonance, watch Carlyle in OUAT episode 8 (\\"Desparate Souls\\") and then watch him here. That man can ACT!!!!<br /><br />Too bad \\"The Last Enemy\\" didn't get a season 2....
0307949486|4.0|Lisbeth Salander is the true hero of Dragon Tattoo.  She is anorexic and may have asperger's syndrome, but also is equipped with hidden talents, such as her brilliant investigative and writing skills.  Salander is also very adept in hacking into other peoples' computers for gathering personal information.  She comes to work with Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who lost a libel case against industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.  Blomkvist also has to serve 3 months in jail along with a heavy fine.<br /><br />Salander, who has never had a close relationship with another human being, gets along stunningly with Blomkvist.  He gets an assignment from an industrialist with a big family, Henrik Vanger, who desires to find out who killed his niece, Harriet Vanger, who has disappeared for close to 40 years.  Harriet was 16 years old when she vanished.<br /><br />Is Harriet actually dead or is it really something else?  In their investigations Blomkvist and Salander, who also become sometime lovers, discover some very disturbing information which include some horrid sexual deviency, rape and incest to be specific, and some strong evidence of a serial killer.<br /><br />There are some surprises in this crime novel, including a rather horrendous torture section involving an unfortunate Mr. Blomkvist.  What is nice about the book's wrap up, is that one of its major characters is avenged in a big way.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome. this game is addictive can't put it down. everyone should download this game, you won't put it down either.

1416511946|5.0|From the first words on the page you can tell this is not an easy book to read. Graphic at times it is a clear portrayal of addiction and the struggle to overcome. The title of the book is a clear dipicition of what the reader should expect. Do not pick up the book if you are expecting anything soft and warm, it is hard and scary.  It is a diary of a man deep into Heroin addiction, jumps around in time and is sometimes a little confusing due to the way it is bits and pieces of notes from Nikki's life during this sad time.

0786955716|3.0|I love D&D tile sets. Just can't get enough of them.<br /><br />PROS: Good, solid tiles as expected. Decent variation. Tiles are useful.<br /><br />CONS: Not enough streets, too many sewer tiles, the tiles for the shops are wanting. And it just seems like the scale is a bit small...just off. I would have like more rooftop options and definitely more roads and outside object tiles. Even with 2 of these sets it does not cut it enough to get me to 4 stars.<br /><br />It's the \\"almost set\\" for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|d a n g u h a v e t ot e t th e g a m e a w e s o m e
B0043BQVGY|5.0|PROS: I like this set more than most. It's my favorite master set and I have them all. The tiles are sturdy and very functional. It makes for a good starter set. Two sets would be helpful, especially for classic dungeon crawls. But one set is fine. The door and pit tiles are great! There are some nice big areas. Good statue and decorative pieces.<br /><br />CONS: A couple more hallway tiles might be nice. A treasure chest would get my purr up. The only other negative comments boil down to preferences, no more. I would like to see sleeping quarters, kitchen facilities, and maybe a couple rough walled passageways. In other words, more diversity and enough to make a fully functioning dungeon complex. This set is ripe for a \\"Part 2\\" version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app, keeps me busy for hours....sometimes you have to play the same game over and over to get points but it'd still fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun app.. does what it says and I love the variety of games offered. I recommend it to anybody
B006FLGBGA|3.0|I thought it would be better, but all around pretty decent movie. I like the issues that it brought up when doing genetic engineering of this kind and how we, as humans, don't think about the \\"by products\\" of our actions. We as a whole only focus on the goal. Prior to watching the movie I read Michael Crichton's Next. It really goes into some of the issues that arise from this sort of thing and is a very good read. The movie was good, well done....just seemed to be lacking something or maybe it pushed too much into a narrow time frame. I still liked it though and found it to be worth watching.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is one of the top reasons why I haven't been able to switch to Windows Phone. It just the best. Great prediction capabilities as well as excellent customization options. Please don't change
B0054JELS4|5.0|We started watching NCIS on tv in syndication, then onto its regular broadcast day.  Absolutly fell in love with the show.  It is the best show on tv these days in my opinion. Love all the characters and expiriences than occur. The show just never gets old. We, however, wanted to watch the shows in order, to be able to make sense of some of the timelines in the episodes.  My wife and I decided this was the perfect Christmas gift to each other.  Best decision we made.  Plus we missed season eight entirely and wanted to catch up.  Product shipped fast and as usual was as expected.  Also it was a good value to buy them all together. Can not wait for season nine.

B001GQSY64|1.0|Everything in this entire movie was shallow. The dialog was so poorly written and repetitive that it hurt my head. They repeatedly stated the plot verbally so many times that a 3 year old with ADD and an IV drip hooked up to a bag of sweet tarts dissolved in sprite couldn't lose track of what was going on. Sure, maybe kids will like it, in the sense that kids like a lot of trash, you can show kids other better things and they'll still like them. The argument, \\"kids will like it\\" is pretty shallow praise. After the original 2d animated series I had very high hopes for this film and was just entirely let down by the whole thing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it is a ton of games in ons app and all the games are fun
B0061S073A|5.0|It's a shame Amazon didn't come up with this themselves &amp; add it as an option on the Fire. Super app!! Wonderful for keeping my 9 year-old entertained but outta my stuff! Works as described &amp; prevents all unintended and/or accidental purchases. Takes extra keystrokes to get out (entering password) but well worth the trouble to make sure your kid(s) are not tapping where they don't belong. A must have app if you hand your Fire over to your kid(s). Highly recommend!!

B006HGXGWU|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'Take Shelter' is a part horror, part psychological drama starring the always excellent Michael Shannon, as an Ohio construction worker who has a history of mental illness in his family, and is now plagued by disturbing visions himself. The question arises whether these visions are portents of things to come or merely the hallucinations of a man gradually experiencing a complete mental breakdown. The entire film is dependent on the big 'payoff' at the end, which turns out to be intentionally ambiguous according to writer/director Jeff Nichols, and has sparked a great deal of controversy over the internet, as to how to interpret such an ambiguous denouement.<br /><br />Nichols presents his story more as a parable than a drama about real life people. Most of the characters are referred to by first names only, such as Michael Shannon's 'Curtis' and his wife 'Samantha' (also well-played by Jessica Chastain). Curtis is sort of an everyman, distinguished only by the fact that his daughter, Hannah, is deaf, and that his mother is a schizophrenic, now living in an assisted living facility. Everyone in Nichols' rural Ohio community, seems to be overly grim and lacking any kind of sense of humor. What's more, there are few discussions by any of the characters that would ground them in any particular place and time.<br /><br />A good part of the film is taken up with depicting all of the alarming visions Curtis is experiencing. The visions run the gamut from Curtis being attacked by his dog, zombie-like people attempting to break into his house and his car while he's driving with his daughter, as well as a giant flock of birds that seemingly hone in on Curtis as a target.<br /><br />Curtis becomes convinced that the visions he experiences, are real, and as a result decides to build a shelter to protect his family from an oncoming apocalyptic storm. His co-worker buddy, Dewart, decides to help him as they borrow their company's heavy digging machinery without authorization and use it to construct the shelter. It's Dewart's devotion to Curtis that causes him to use poor judgment in allowing Curtis to use the machinery without permission. I found Dewart's capitulation to Curtis' request, still a bit too easy as of course such an action could place both their jobs in jeopardy. As it turns out, that's exactly what happens: Curtis is fired and Dewart is suspended for two weeks.<br /><br />For those who were satisfied with the machinations of Nichols' grim characters for most of the film, I can only say that everyone's concept of suspense is different. My feeling was that by the end of the film, the payoff had to be pretty darn good, since the events leading up to it were markedly slow-going, a bit repetitious and not all that absorbing. Nevertheless, I will concede that the ambiguity of the film's ending is food for thought--although ultimately, not as profound as many would like to believe.<br /><br />The film's ending can be interpreted in two distinct ways. The first interpretation is that Curtis' visions were real and his warnings to his community about an impending apocalypse, fell on deaf ears. The storm can be seen as the ultimate result of global warming, with Nichols criticizing those unconcerned about environmental disaster preparedness as well as a general critique on those who rely solely on rationalism as a guide through life. Ironically (with Interpretation #1), it's Samantha, Curtis' well-meaning, 'rational' wife, who gets the shock of her life when she looks out toward the horizon at the beach and sees the 'apocalypse' bearing down on her and her family. Some internet posters argue that since the storm is seen in the reflection of the beach house window (and not from Curtis' point of view which we had always seen before), this is proof that the storm is meant to be real.

B00364K6YW|3.0|The 1995 BBC version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is without a doubt the best ever produced. But I was BEYOND astonished to discover a very poor editing decision in the \\"digitally restored version.\\" Choose an earlier version of the DVD, not this one.   For reasons passing all understanding, the editor of this new edition almost entirely deleted the first issue (i.e., George Wickham's ill behavior) from the letter which Darcy writes Eliza. Without this information, the ensuing drama involving Eliza's sister makes no sense.  Who allowed this desecration to occur?

B004W2UBYW|4.0|It would be easy to have underestimated Steve Jobs's contribution to computing. Isaacson doesn't do that, though I am not sure he really understands what computers were before Jobs and how much he had to do with what they are now. This is not to disparage the book, it provides what appears to be a very fair, spirited, and humane description of Jobs's life and times. I recommend the book: it's  interesting, balanced, and complete. Jobs famous reality bending force field came in for much description but it is a common feature of really good sales people--and Jobs was that. I will complain that like many books these days, it's too damn long. But readers can skip through the repetitive bits.  Just one last thing--the book dispels forever the Business School myth that the most important thing a successful business needs is sound by-the-book management. What businesses need are bright creative people who know what customers need before they do and make sure they get it.

B003Q6D27S|1.0|I'm a big fan of the first three Saw films but they could have really stopped at the third one, because of the rest of the franchise heavily relied on flashbacks so that Tobin Bell could be a part of all the films. So for four films straight we have to get the backstory of Jigsaw and tie up any loose ends from the six previous films. If they knew they were going to use Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith for these films, then should have kept them alive and not kill them off so early.  Saw VII was bad, not the worst in the franchise but very bad nonetheless and opens up the possibility of an 8th film if they so decide to do so. That's why End is in quotation marks in my title. The first trap in the film made no sense as they aren't connected to anything or anyone in this film and these traps are mostly done in private areas and never explained why this one is made public for everyone to see who was walking by that day. The trap just didn't make sense. The first trap is basically for the added gore. Then they have this meeting of something of all the Jigsaw survivors and this one lady who talks about her trap, but we never seen her trap in previous films, that trap was there to be added.  Also this film made horrible mistakes in killing off all the main characters by the fourth film and we're getting all these new characters like we're suppose to care for them knowing they are going to die anyway. They killed off important characters like Det. Kerry who was the lead detective early on, so she should have made it all the way to the last film.  This one we have Sean Patrick Flanery playing some author, who lied about being a part of Jigsaw's games now him along with his entourage and wife have to suffer because of it. Meanwhile Jill is trying to keep herself from being caught by Hoffman as the results from Saw VI. This plot and sub plot is very weak because in the previous films the subjects that Jigsaw chose were being tested. SPF's character was just being tested for beinga liar.  It just seemed to me that Betsy Russell and Costas Mandylor wasn't too thrilled on doing this film because they gave very wooden performances as well as Chad Donnella as he was stiff in his scenes as they were the leading actors in this movie. S. Patrick Flanery must have had some botox injected in his face because his facial expressions didn't change at all. Cary Elwes comes back but in total he's in the film for a whole 7 minutes, as he appears sporadically in the film and he couldn't do much to save it. If the leading actors aren't giving good performances then we can only fear what the supporting actors are bringing to the table which isn't much as they are assigned to be obnoxious characters and their main objectives is to just cuss and scream, so we could care less if they got their guts ripped out. Of course the Saw franchise will never be recognized for it's acting abilities which is why no big name actors were apart of it except for Danny Glover in the 1st film but his movie roles recently have been questionable.  They could have done better to end the franchise then what they put out. Just because you had Saw films come out every year doesn't mean rush through the last one. To date Saw III was the highest grossing film for the Saw franchise and it should have told the writers and whatnot after the rest didn't rack up as much mone , that they should have concentrated and really thought out the last film. Should have written it in a way that would have made viewers wanting more but can't, now it's don't want anymore sequels.

031261246X|3.0|Reading books about cyber crime has always made me twitch due to the factual errors on all levels. Hearing that Zero Day has been written by someone in the know, I felt like my tome had come - finally a book that would get its premises right. Unfortunately that was not enough. The characters, their motivation and the flow of the story are missing and the fact that the facts were spot on didn't warrant to much.

B001HUHBAE|5.0|Movie - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />I've always found the mystery genre to be pretty engrossing, especially when it has either a perplexing case to solve, a long or epic narrative, empathetic or interesting characters, or a combination of these. I tend to get my fill of said sleuthing and drama these days from the likes of House M.D., The Mentalist, Castle, and Lie to Me, which are fine and dandy considering they're just TV shows and are thus somewhat limited by their episodic nature and production budgets. Suffice it to say, though, David Fincher really captivated me with his work in Se7en and its unrelenting visceral assault on the senses. Its shock value, grittiness, and downright dark atmosphere were such an eye-opener to the genre (for me, anyway) that it remains one of my all-time favorite films and amongst the top in its class. And then he made Zodiac. While I love Se7en for all that it is stylistically, I dare even say Zodiac barely surpasses it in three ways: 1) the fact that it's a period piece and thus, has more realism (not to mention a lot of this actually happened at some point), 2) is over half an hour longer, which doesn't necessarily add to the characters, but boy does it accentuate the plot, and 3) the sheer amount of obsession as portrayed by the characters of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and to a lesser extent, Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.).<br /><br />That being said, Se7en and Zodiac are both crafty masterpieces in their own rights. But much like how Se7en infused the genre from a more emotional approach with its shock and grotesqueness, Zodiac seems to drive itself with much more technicality using facts, evidence, and frankly, a drier style of investigation to present itself. Not to discredit Se7en for being any less sleuthy, but I believe Zodiac to be slightly more enjoyable for its methodical nature, down-to-earth character portrayals, and massively engaging screenplay.  It's all about subtlety and attentionto detail, much like the aforementioned TV shows listed above, and I was especially delighted to see such a depiction over what seems to, historically, be a very interesting case. Everything from the production, cinematography, score, script, and even sound design have a very low-key feel to them, yet in the end add a real sense of fascination and awe to the entire ordeal and the events that took place over the span of the investigation. And while the case never was solved, Fincher made a very entertaining depiction of it.<br /><br />Video - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Zodiac was shot using the Thomson VIPER FilmStream Camera (a digital camera for those who care) and digitally mastered at 2K resolution. The result is a stunning and gorgeous transfer to Blu-ray. Black levels are the best part of the overall presentation with an amazing amount of definition, even amidst a lot of the darkly-lit venues and nighttime shots with all the little lines in clothing, shading, and texturing easily viewable. The smoke of cigarettes is especially pronounced whenever people were smoking them in a scene. Any shot of Paul Avery smoking up a storm, while subtle like the entire movie itself, looks great. Contrast handles perfectly with every bit of stubble visible on the closeup shots of Graysmith's face. Flesh tones, facial features, you name it; not a single visual element on any person or thing is lost or distorted throughout the entire duration of the film. I shutter to even think about how smudgy/blurry this would look on DVD.<br /><br />As for the colors, they're as natural as you can expect. From the various costuming of the era (late '60s through the '70s), I have to applaud cinematographer Harris Savides, production designer Donald Graham Burt, and art director Keith P. Cunningham for opting to go with a retro look on a contemporary camera. In most period pieces I've seen that take place in the '60s and '70s, rarely do I ever envision it looking as pristine as this. More often than not, titles like this usually end up looking somewhat washed up or a little desaturated through filters and such, which is thankfully not the case here at all. The clothes, their colors, and even the set looks as I'd imagine the '60s and '70s to \\"feel\\" like despite the actual picture being so sharp and gloriously rendered. My favorite scenes for reference are any of the office shots at The Chronicle for its ridiculously clean closeups, any part where people are smoking cigarettes (as much as I despise the act of smoking itself, it looks pretty damn striking in HD if you're any kind of videophile), or the scene where Graysmith goes down into Bob Vaughn's basement (only two 40W bulbs were used to light that entire room, which just goes to show how amazing the that Thomson VIPER camera is). This is reference video all the way.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5 / 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English, English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />In response to all the other reviews I've read around the Internet about the audio being bad, I have to disagree with the low ratings. Yes, Zodiac is extremely dialogue-centric. It's a methodical, meat-and-potatoes, long-winding, and very technical investigation that relies more on plot progression, mood, and visual presentation for its atmospherics as opposed to the loud, bombastic, razzle dazzle mixes we've heard in other Fincher films. Ren Klyce's sound design is very subtle here with not a whole lot in terms of quantity, though he makes for it with quality. A good deal of the sound effects happen either in crowded areas (The Chronicle's offices) or in the more suspenseful moments (when Zodiac commits or is about to commit a murder). Dialogue, obviously, is not a problem. For all the talking there is, not a single line is lost, and even the phone calls sound very precise. The center channel does most of the work, while various background effects have great directionality and separation during the more busy sequences across the fronts. The opening credits is a good example of what I mean.<br /><br />The score by David Shire fits the period well, and the mood of the film even more so, and as we see the first letter from Zodiac make its way from the mail truck up the secretary, there's a very understated amount of depth and fidelity amongst all the doors, carts, typewriters, and telephones ringing all around the place. This is about as much as you'll hear from the rear speakers until the movie gets to other crowded scenes (people on the streets, visits at the police station, or any of the musical montages for the passing of time). Like I said, it's a sound design that's less about quantity and more about quality. For all the Fincher films I've heard Klyce mix that are on BD, I have to say the guy knows what he's doing. And if Fincher wanted to go a little quieter for this particular title, then so be it. It's no sonic powerhouse like Se7en or Fight Club beforehand, but for what it's worth and for what the film is, I'm fine with the way the movie is presented.  My favorite parts are the aforementioned opening credits (lots of busy bodies and noises, the scene where Zodiac attacks the couple by the lake (it's silently disturbing with no music, all the rustling grass, blowing wind, and stabbing and screaming at the end of it), and finally the part where Graysmith is in the basement with Bob Vaughn (for just really creepy atmospherics overall).<br /><br />Extras - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director David Fincher)<br />Fincher goes through many of the nuts and bolts about the making of the film. I especially like how he keeps everything in a sort of \\"present tense\\" mindset whenever he talks about a particular aspect of the movie and its filming. When said factoid or comment occurs, he talks about it vividly in great detail as if he were reliving the moment right there, only with the occasional anecdote to compliment it. I also like the fact that he doesn't get too anecdotal when talking about the actors on screen. Comments about them usually tend to be about casting, preparation for the role, and any of the quirks/experiences that occurred during the many, many, many takes he did with them on set. In addition, he talks about what it was like working with the real Robert Graysmith, Dave Toschi, and other people who were involved in the case and how the film portrayed them and the events that unfolded. I was also very surprised at all the parts Fincher pointed out that were either matte painting or blue screen backgrounds. They really fooled me the whole time into thinking that was just stellar production design. And finally, Fincher makes mention of the various parts they wrote took some dramatic licenses (which I feel worked pretty well).<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.; Producer Brad Fischer, Screenwriter James Vanderbilt, and Author James Ellroy)<br />The two groups were recorded separately and dispersed into various locations of the film, but it's an entertaining listen, nonetheless. Most of the commentary comes from the executive side with Fischer and the two James' talking about a multitude of elements from the making of the movie, the interpretations and themes within the plot, how the actual events affected the lives of all the people and communities involved, and various anecdotes that range from jokey to insightful. The commentary from the actors. has more to do with recollections of filming, acting (as well as a few stories here and there), and there own interpretations of the characters and writing. There's a wealth of information to be heard on this track that compliments Fincher's commentary very well, so fans of the film should definitely give it a listen every now and again. I only wish the actors commentary would've included Mark Ruffalo as well, since he played such a huge part as Dave Toschi and provided such a fantastic performance in the process.<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />The special features are divided into 2 sections: The Film and The Facts (one for the movie and the other for the actual historical events).<br /><br />The Film<br /><br />- Zodiac Deciphered (HD; 54:15 altogether)<br />A pretty in-depth look at the making of Zodiac. It covers a wide range of of the technical work that went from the idea of the movie to the construction of all the sets, how they were shot, the actors and how they portrayed the characters, and even a little of the theme analysis at the end. You can play all the featurettes together or.. individually, but who'd want to do that? For those who are curious, though, here's the breakdown of the individual features:<br /><br />- Zodiac Deciphered (5:23)<br />Discusses the original rights lapse from Disney and how producer Brad Fischer was able to get it from the real Robert Graysmith himself. He and screenwriter James Vanderbilt had initially thought of Fincher from the get-go thinking he would actually turn it down. Obviously, it's a good thing he didn't.<br /><br />- Blue Rock Springs (8:09)<br />Talks mostly about the location scouting of Blue Rock Springs and how they chose a slightly different spot in the movie since the real location had changed over the years. Of interesting and morbid note is also the fact that they had the real Darlene Ferrin's clothes from evidence to make an exact replica of for the actress.<br /><br />- The San Francisco Chronicle (13:12)<br />Tells how they built the office from scratch and went to great lengths for the props. In addition to old telephones, they even went so far as to dig up the microfilm with the original newspaper publications from the real-life reports that were printed during the time of the actual killings. They also show a warehouse full of period clothing, and one funny little bit of Fincher doing 36 takes to get the right throw of a book on a car seat (that's dedication right there).<br /><br />- The Hall of Justice (6:27)<br />Looks mainly at the casting of Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi and Anthony Edwards as Bill Armstrong. They show pictures of their actual counterparts for comparison, and the resemblances are remarkable. At one point, they even had the real Dave Toschi on set giving out autographed boxes of animal crackers.<br /><br />- Presidio Heights (5:06)<br />Talks about the difficulty they had with shooting on location (as alluded to by Fincher's audio commentary on Disc 1 about a Homeowner's Association). To get around that problem, they built a set to double for shooting and used blue screens and CG to insert backgrounds, houses, and vehicles. Needless to say, they did an amazing job that certainly fooled me.<br /><br />- Lake Barryessa (7:27)<br />Starts off with the real Robert Graysmith talking about how impressed he was with Fincher's ability to realize they weren't even in the original spot when they initially got there for scouting. And when they finally did get the right spot, they actually had to plant their own shrubs and trees because so much of it had eroded over the course of time. In addition, there's an interesting anecdote involving Fincher and a 1-thread alteration to the Zodiac's mask.<br /><br />- Obsession (8:27)<br />Discusses some of the movie's themes and how the information they compiled for the plot was actually not available because the police wouldn't release it publicly. This feature also makes special mention of the fact that the point of the story is not establish the premise that Arthur Leigh Allen was the Zodiac, but that Graysmith and Toschi believed him to be, and that the real conclusion is anyone's guess since the case was never solved even to this day. Everything up to this point is either conjecture or just circumstance.<br /><br />- The Visual Effects of Zodiac (HD; 15:18)<br />This featurette covers the amount of stunning work that went into, what apparently, was the work of the visual effects gurus. Specifically, the gorgeous opening shot of San Fransisco in the opening credits was completely CG'd. Originally, they had taken still photos of the city using the Thomson VIPER with a longer lens and used those as reference for the correct lighting and structure detail. They also point out that Paul Stine's cab ride around San Fransisco, his bloddy murder, the Kathleen Johns, and the Transamerica Pyramid sequences were all either computer generated or composited as well. Again, great work by that team, I really couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />- Pre-Visualization<br />Blue Rock Springs (SD; 1:06)<br />Lake Barryessa (SD; 4:21)<br />San Fransisco (SD; 1:02)<br /><br />- Theatrical Trailer (HD; 2:32)<br /><br />The Facts<br /><br />- This Is The Zodiac Speaking (HD; 1:42:18 altogether)<br />A massive feature that gives a haunting recollection of the murders Zodiac took credit for in his letters. Each segment includes interviews from the police officers involved, various experts, and even the survivors of the attacks. Each piece also includes case photos from the crime scene investigations, evidence from those who passed (such as Darlene Ferrin and Paul Stine's clothes), and even vintage footage from the actual TV reports. The present-day interviews with the people were a lot more intense than I thought they'd be, especially when they go into detail about the actual attacks themselves. It's sort of an unreal and horrifying story to listen to when you've actually seen the movie and then listen to the words straight from the person that nearly died those nights. For all the emotions a movie can induce from its script, screenplay, and cinematography, I'd be hard-pressed not to say that this entire feature isn't scarier than the movie itself. Definitely give this a watch if you're like me and don't know much about the case in general, but areintrigued, regardless. Here's a breakdown of the segments individually:<br /><br />- Lake Herman Road (13:15)<br />- Blue Rock Springs (22:44)<br />- Lake Barryessa (37:33)<br />- San Fransisco (28:45)<br /><br />- Prime Suspect: His Name Was Arthur Leigh Allen (HD; 42:35)<br />Since the book was written by Graysmith and thus adapted with the source material in which he compiled for us to believe that Zodiac was Allen, much of this feature focuses on said assumption using interviews with the officers, experts, and people involved with the investigation. It's a fascinating discussion about all the facts they did find and includes personal accounts from Bob Cheney (the man that knew Allen right before the killings started) as well as Ralph Spinelli (who claims to have encountered Allen with some pretty striking allegations that made Allen seem even more suspect afterward). It's a very in-depth look at the man a lot of people believed to be the culprit and should definitely be watched at least once for any fan of the film or case.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />I first saw this movie in '09 when I was lucky enough to find the Blu-ray on sale for $13 somewhere and don't regret the blind-buy one bit. I've become a big fan of David Fincher within the last 5-ish years and really appreciate his directing prowess and attention to detail. I'm too young to actually have lived through the happenings of these events, but the occasional crime case (whether it be real or fictional) is a cool way to keep my mind sharp, and I find it spectacular when someone can actually adapt these real-world crimes into some kind of television or cinematic gem that transcends beyond itself into something even more (in this case, something of a retrospective phenomenon). The acting, production value, and writing are all stupendous in this film. It's engrossingly epic and obsessively entertaining. The video quality is immaculate in HD, and while the audio presentation is subtle and nuanced (much like the film and its writing elements), it's as accurate a representation as you could ask for when given the moments on screen. Best of all, though, are a couple of excellent commentaries and an exhausting amount of supplements covering both the filming and real-life facts behind the entire Zodiac arc. This should be a must-own for fans of Fincher, and especially those who enjoy murder-mysteries.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|the first time I played these games was on my ds however this is better in that you get tokens every time you enter. this also allows you to have better control of the actions and its free to have so you won't be out any money if you don't like it.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Well this movie is a pretty good superhero movie, but the bigger problem is that the Ultaviolet download does not work. It is hard to work to begin with, and then won't let you go through the steps to claim your Digital Copy. Why can't they get rid of Ultaviolet and let us have a digital copy that we can download for our mobile devices.  If you have a mobile device that is not connected to the net good luck watching movies with ultraviolet. Now I am going to have to digitize the DVD and add it to my ITUNES library on my own.  What a waste.  My suggestion is don't pay the extra money for Digital Copy, your throwning you money away. Warner Brothers needs to get this fixed.

0060873027|3.0|Crichton's books generally take about 50 to 100 pages to become interesting.  This book takes 300.  The character expositions are disappointing, almost like reading a textbook - you don't have a feel for any of the characters until the late stages of the book.  The story component involving Detective Watanabe was underplayed.  More inclusion of his character throughout the novel would have alleviated a major fault in the book, which is that the story is seen from only one perspective: that of the lost students.  Finally, the absence of any mildly-believable scientific explanation regarding the human shrinking machine threw a wrench into the whole plotline, at least until I was willing to suspend my disbelief in the last 100 pages of the book.  All things said, if you decide to read this book, do so only because you're a die-hard Crichton fan.  But realize that you have to invest approximately 300 pages of reading with major plotholes, poor story-writing, and bad exposition, before you see a return on that investment.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|The SRK is my favorite general purpose field knife from Cold Steel.  I've owned the Master Tanto, Trail Master, Master Hunter and the SRK.  Each attracted my attention for different uses.  The SRK because of its medium size, durable build and versatile blade shape.  The blade is sharp, the handle well-shaped for my medium-sized hand, and the balance is good - slightly balanced toward the blade.  My only real complaint is the lack of a solid pommel that could be used to hammer things in the field when a hammer isn't available.<br /><br />The Secur-ex sheath is of the hard plastic variety, and works well enough.  Some may prefer Kydex or soft nylon, but this works.<br /><br />Overall, a great knife!

B004LWZW4M|5.0|If Apes really did rise to greatness and surpass humans how would it really go down? Rise of the Planet of the Apes took that route instead of the Science Fiction direction that the Apes films normally take on.<br /><br />The main ape is Caesar and he rises to greatness and has the most fleshed out character arc among all the actors.  Yes, Caesar is played by an actual actor with the digital effects layered over him.  The performance is so great you can't tell which is the actor and which is the digital effects.<br /><br />The film could be a political statement about the suppressed rising above the others and taking over. The Apes have done just that and at a much quicker pace breaking out of the cages and putting the humans in there where they belong.<br /><br />James Franco is the lead actor in this and does as good as a job as he can with what he's given to work with.  The script keeps the human actors in the foreground while we focus more on the Ape that the James Franco character takes home and nurtures to power.<br /><br />His father is played by John Lithgow who is battling Alzheimer's and pretty much serves just that purpose and no other.  Tom Felton plays the mean ape keeper that harasses the chimpanzee's in captivation which is never a good idea. Freida Pinto who was in Woody Allen's \\"You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger\\" played beautiful in that and she plays beautiful in this as James Franco's girlfriend.  You first suspect that maybe she understands what's going on with the Apes intelligence and will offer insight to the Franco character, but instead she turns out to be an observing bystander just like the rest of us.<br /><br />This movie was more serious than the average entertaining blockbuster. It's intelligent and I found myself routing for the Apes in the end and you will too.  When they rise and take revenge the film turns into a exceptional orchestrated climax that borders along the lines of a horror film, except in this, the humans have it coming.<br /><br />**spoiler**<br /><br />I'm sure there will be a sequel since in this one the Apes take over San Francisco by the end of the film and they have their eyes on an even bigger prize.  The World.since in this one the Apes take over San Francisco by the end of the film and they have their eyes on an even bigger prize.  The World.

Are there some gaffs that \\"true fans\\" will notice and blog in their parent's basements about? Yes, but thats all movies.<br /><br />Dont like it, start a movie studio and do it right.<br /><br />Lots of nice easter eggs and references to T2. Pop some popcorn and watch. I would review the BR extras, but dont have a BR player. I rented it with the option of getting a disc, and at some point a BR player will make its way to our house. Till then...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|really, really good Bible. different versions too. I would recommend this app to anyone I like the niv version the best great app
B006IVBSBU|4.0|I really do not think that this is movie for everyone. It is slow building, not very action packed, and sometimes very predictable.  The suspense I felt while watching this movie was less about the suspense in the movie and more concerning the possibility and reality that something like this could actually happen and has happened in the past.  However, despite these short-comings, I did find the movie enjoyable.  The social discord that occurred as a result of the outbreak is always interesting to see.  In the end, it is a thought provoking movie, which I tend to enjoy.  Some complaints about the movie is that it seems to be pandering to the pharmaceutical companies. However, I didn't really see this because at the end of the day while inoculations are important not everything can be cured by drugs.  The message I got from the movie was more concerning personal hygiene.  A lot of illness can easily spread from the practice of poor hygiene (i.e. not washing your hands, coughing/sneezing into your hands, or constant touching of your face).  I left the movie counting how many times I touched my face before I got home instead of wanting to get an inoculation.  And the number I reached was actually pretty frightening, especially considering that it was a subconscious movement almost every single time it happened.

0439023513|5.0|I have got to say, this trilogy contains some of the best books I've ever read!! Catching Fire is probably my favorite but Mockingjay presents a fantastic ending to an equally awesome series. Katniss realizes near the end that the government she is helping to overthrow and the government she is helping to usher in is frighteningly similar; so the Girl on Fire takes the future of Panem in her own hands and her decision frankly shocked me. The ending of this book is gripping and will leave you with tears in your eyes, but the tears should help your blood-shot eyes since you've been reading this novel all night long.
1416589473|4.0|Usually you can flip through a book based on a video game in the store or preview it online and you can tell pretty quickly that it is going to be a disaster. They commonly feature poor writing, bad editing, and horrendous stories that only hardcore fans of the game who read very little can enjoy. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when I checked out the preview for this book and it wasn't half bad.<br /><br />I'm not going to claim that this is the height of fantasy writing. If you want that, you need to turn to authors like Patrick Rothfuss, Robert Jordan, George R. R. Martin, and Robin Hobb. However, if you play Guild Wars or are looking forward to Guild Wars 2, this is an enjoyable read. The characters could use a bit more fleshing out, and they really could have taken a bit more time to tell the story instead of trying to jam it into as few pages as possible, but those are minor complaints. I found myself interested enough that I stayed up late to finish the book.

B005K0HDGE|1.0|I am a lifelong reader about to give up on mr king. in a day and age where political commentary is free all over the internet, i can see absolutely no reason to pay 20 bucks to have a liberal hypocrite pontificate on how conservatives are the ultimate boogeyman. In one scene, the 'hero' is in downtown dallas and noting how the scary religious people down there wear customized boots and wear guns. He is trying to paint them as redneck hickabillies who are just dumb enough to be dangerous. Why waste energy imagining a scary character when a caricature of mr kings political enemies will do? This isn't even the worst of it. The worst of it is that somehow the texans are evil for carrying guns and wearing custom boots while the enlightened liberal hero is running around killing people and sleeping like a baby at night. Renting an apartment in the god fearing part of town where people go to church is anathema while hanging out with people who shoot hookers and then themselves is enlightened. Really mr. king? that's the best you have?

0062112430|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. By looking at all the reviews for this novel, I really expected sooo much worse, but in reality I found the overall experience enjoyable, if a bit slow.   I think more than anything I adored the writing. I loved the way Oliver could insert such poignant and stirring memories from Lena's past into the present action. I loved the way she could express the intense fear this world provoked in people. I could feel the helpless, desperation Lena felt the closer she got to her procedure. Oliver really knows how to write, but I think she has a harder time cutting out some unnecessary bits in her writing. The first 100 pages were not the easiest to read.   As for the characters, I actually liked Lena, which is good for a YA heroine. I didn't find her whiny, too awkward, or too strong. She seemed pretty normal, or as normal as a heroine in a dystopian novel can be. Alex was okay as well. I still think I still smelled a bit of the stink of perfectly perfect boyfriend, but I think he has potential and is a thousands time better than Edward Cullen. Yes, he recites poetry, but because that's outlawed I can buy it that he'd want to read them, and also shared them with Lena. As for the rest, I loved Hana and Gracie, and of course Lena's family were eerie and frightening in their maintaining the propaganda of the cure.  The world wasn't perfect, but as this is a series I'm hoping there will be more about why the world became this way, and how exactly the government started giving the cure. I can't complain; if I was the author I'd hold onto that information for the characters to figure out themselves, too. So, like many first books in a series, the author spent much of this novel introducing characters and their background, but kept a lot more about their world a mystery. I find that realistic, though. In a world like this, asking questions would only kill you. And honestly, I was more worried about Lena and Alex's fate.   I would've loved afaster-paced novel, with more action and a better setup in the first 100 pages, but I did really enjoy the novel. It kept me engaged and I was shocked at the ending. For me, if a novel delivers in the last 100 pages, I will forget about the problems in the first 100 or 100 pages. Oliver is leaving a lot to mystery and I'm for sure going to check out the next one!

0345347951|1.0|Arthur has written a lot of good classical science fiction. This book is not one of them. It is very famous but lacks the spirits of good ones like city and stars, 200x series or Rama.  Clark lost himself in this great nonsense of transforming human kind in other thing that is just mind. The plot is silly and at the end you will ask yourself if Clark paid someone to write it.

The franchise has come to America. The movie consists of basically the same stuff, torture, killing, and scantily clad/ nude girls. What makes this one different is the excessive amount of twists the story takes. It constantly leads you in one direction and BAM!

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in our Stars is heart-wrenching, romantic in the most worldly and genuine interpretation of the word, indelibly thought-provoking, exceedingly symbolic, and spectacularly funny.  John Green has done it again. He has recreated with merely imagination, influence, and ink the completely characteristic and honest mind of a teenager, while acing a new challenge: the mind of a teenage girl. I reiterate, John Green has done it again, and this time he has done it even better.  Simultaneously clever, tragic, and hysterical, with equal doses of realism, hope, and heartache, The Fault in our Stars is an striking and valuable truth. Hazel's narrative seems to put into words the indescribable bits of us that come along seemingly at this one time in a life, while doing complete justice to the kinds of emotions that none but the terminally diagnosed fully comprehend.  Most importantly, John Green never undervalues the intelligence of his readers, and he presents a broken that somehow remains whole world to a young adult audience in yet another raw and real novel. To me, this is what sets John apart.  As a 16 year-old girl, I'd like to give you a suggestion. If you're thinking about purchasing this novel, I recommend you do so as soon as is humanly possible.

The potential is there in the storyline for a knock your socks off romantic supernatural mystery.  The author spends far too much time explaining, and via dialogue no less, instead of allowing the story to tell itself through the characters and their involvement with each other.  Is this a young adult novel?  Where was her editor?  Well, it is her first effort.  Maybe the sequel will be better.  I doubt I'll bother, though.
B005QUQP76|4.0|I've had this mouse for about a week now, purchased w/ the Corsair K60 keyboard (which I love) and am still on the fence about the ergonomics.<br /><br />My only gripe, and the thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating, is the fit of the mouse in my hand; It seems to have been made for a palm grip, with the thumb on the left panel and only the pinky on the right, with all three remaining digits above Mouse 1, 2 and 3. Whereas my grip of choice (which is somewhat claw-like) leaves both pinky and ring fingers grasping the right side of the mouse. It will accommodate a grip like mine, but seems tailored more for the palm style.<br /><br />That said, everything works extremely well; The weight, button clicks, accuracy of the sensor, material quality, visual aesthetics, et cetera are all excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone comfortable w/ the shape.<br /><br />Update: This mouse barely made it past the 6 month mark before ceasing to function entirely. I then went back to my trusty G9 which had been waiting patiently for this pretender to vacate the throne. I'll be sticking with Logitech for my mice from now on. No one else seems to be able to put together a reliable product.
B005TPCQ5I|4.0|This music soundtrack (Rachel Portman) with so many great songs from 'Elvis Costello', 'Fatboy Slim', and 'Tears For Fears', lends so much to this movie.  They are as diverse as the two lead characters can be. This is directed by Lone Scherfig (An Education), from the novel and screenplay written by David Nicholls, who always adds a great mix of music to her movies.  We meet Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter-&#34;Dex&#34; (Jim Sturgess) on the night of their graduation from their University in England. This is the night in which this unlikely couple gets together on the 15th of July, 1988.  The time spent is full of awkwardness, so much so it is palpable to the viewer. They are so uncomfortable with each other until the point of resignation to remain platonic, with Dex adding, &#34;Maybe we could just be friends&#34;.  At the time it is a good idea for the both of them although can it remain this way?  A different sort of romantic film where we watch these two growing up in their adult lives and carving out their places in the world. Riddled with some twists and turns that are unexpected and then finessed makes this not your usual fare.<br /><br />This 'friendship' will span lofty decades in which the two faithfully get together every &#34;One Day&#34; of each and every year.  This day always being July 15th.  The Anniversary of Them ...<br /><br />Emma being the more scholastic type with a well-rounded disposition, she has a razor sharp wit and is very sweet along with being quite caring. Dex continues being more the extrovert along with his dalliances with women.  Something intangible remains with these two from that night together, each intrigued with the other as he or she head off in separate directions to lead their own lives. This again until they reach July 15th once again.  Dex takes a much more worldly approach to his employment, although briefly takes a position as an English teacher then quickly changes his course to fame.  He becomes a mildly popular host of a dance-type program and also a personality of note on television, to the disapproval of his parents (mainly his father).  His mother, portrayed by the always wonderful Patricia Clarkson, is more understanding of her son although shares a much shorter screen time.<br /><br />Emma and Dex go forward with their lives separately now after being together on the same July day as the year before. Dex is building his popularity and womanizing and Emma is working in a dead-end job in a Tex-Mex restaurant.  This is where she meets her sort of boyfriend, Ian Whitehead (Rafe Spall). They eventually move into a flat together and she finally finishes some schooling and becomes a teacher herself.  Dex is getting into all kinds of trouble and meeting with Emma to discuss issues at hand or to just be together annually.  Through thick and thin these two carve out their lives during many years of pitfalls and meetings with each other ... in London, in Paris, they never lose track of the other.  The timing never seems right for the pair to be together although the subject flirts with them every year, the 'what ifs' or 'the maybes'. They help each other as much as hurt themselves by hiding their obvious love for one another.  Twenty years is so long to be holding onto what could have been.  When the time is right and Dex is at his wits end with his life in disarray he goes to Paris on the fateful July day.  Emma is with her new and exciting boyfriend, a Frenchman, and has to decide if her love for Dex is a sure thing.  Could their love be that one special love of a lifetime?  Should they take that gamble?<br /><br />It is at about this point that the movie takes a massive shift in the plot and I never expected this twist but surprisingly it did not anger me but had me questioning; I was completely bewildered.<br /><br />This movie has been classed in the Romantic Comedy genre, although I maybe snickered a couple of times because of Emma's quick razor-sharp retorts and a sharp wit she does have a large store of.  I would definitely say this is a drama containing lots of romantic leanings, loving gestures, and a total sweeping of 'opposites attract' that carries this couple along through the years.  The whole premise of meeting every year on the anniversary date of their first meeting is overtly romantic.  Yes, this is a subjective romantic movie, thus the scattered reviews from a vehement &#34;I hate it&#34; to &#34;I love it&#34;.he does have a large store of.

B000006NPY|5.0|And that's a very good thing!<br /><br />Adore tends to be reviled by a fair number of Pumpkins fans for being different than it's predecessors. And it's true, it is.  Missing are the sonic angst cranked to \\"11\\" and orchestral grandeur which served both of those iconic albums so well. Adore is more intimate and introspective in feel, something you'd want to see played live in a small club, not an arena.<br /><br />In exchange for the missing wall of sound and audible fireworks you get a mature well constructed cohesive album, with some great song writing and vocals by Mr. Corgan<br /><br />It's an album for a rainy sunday at home, not a frenetic friday night on the town, and within it's own terms, it is a definite success.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I loved this app until I updated it this morning. Now it doesn't work and keeps telling me to force close the app. Amazon ruined this app with this new update and now I am having to remove from my tablet. The update takes up way too much space as previous reviews state.
B000063Y8F|2.0|I already own the Rosle garlic press, but mine was not made in China and is substantially higher quality and the mechanism is very smooth.  I did not read the reviews as your product info stated that the press was made in the USA.  I have been disappointed that most stores,even Williams Sonoma, are carrying the press made in China.  I just got my order - which was to be a gift for my sister- and the press is NOT made in the USA.  You need to change the description on your site ASAP.  This is really false advertising and very deceptive. Many people are trying to purchase products made in the USA or at least not made in China.  I would not have ordered this garlic press had I known it was made in China. I wish I would have spent more time checking out the other reviews.  I can see that this deceptive behavior is not new.  Reviews go way back. Not good business.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|I have been a big fan of Beth Hart for a while now and Joe Bonamassa is a wonderful guitarist but whoever the genius was in putting these two together has my everlasting thanks. Simply incredible. If I were buying this in vinyl I would have to buy at least a dozen because I would be wearing them out.

144234430X|4.0|I am a fan of Stephen king but I don't think this was his best book. It would make a great movie tho and if it ever does I will go see it.<br />As all of his books that he has written, this did keep my interest and I had bought this from Audible and the narrator did the book really well I think. For me tho some parts of the book dragged on an I did not overly like Sadie, so tended to annoy me in some ways and I did not care for the whole sex addict thing King did with her, for me it just did not fit with her having been in an abusive marriage.<br />The ending fit well with the story but I have to admit not really what I wanted. lol.<br />If you enjoy Stephen king of you just enjoy time travel books then you really should read this book not his best work IMO but still very well written and worth my/your time.

B001GA1RFA|1.0|The Kindle version does not show the footnotes of which there are many and are an important part of the book.
1594744769|4.0|Having been a peculiar child myself, and later, a peculiar adult (I can talk to dead people) I found the book entertaining. Brought back memories of the \\"Side Show Freaks\\" that I recall from childhood. Very interesting photography, which I am also a fan of old photos. This was a smooth easy read, and I would reccommend it to anyone that desires a break from thier ordinary choice of book.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I admit that I'm a huge \\"Planet of the Apes\\" fan. As a child, I loved all of the original films, and I even \\"went Ape for a day\\" when movie theaters showed all 5 original Apes films back-to-back in one day back in the mid-1970s. I'm also a fan of the Tim Burton \\"Planet of the Apes\\" film (which is far more faithful to the source novel than the others). So it was with a sense of trepidation that I viewed this latest \\"re-imagining.\\" As it turns out, my fears were for naught. This film, which pretty much reconceptualizes \\"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\\" (the 4th film in the original franchise), is a smart, exciting, and surprisingly sophisticated take on how humanity could engineer its own demise at the hands of another species. James Franco is solid in the lead as a researcher with a strong sense of ethics and a passion to develop a cure for Alzheimer's, a disease that plagues his father, played by the always brilliant John Lithgow. The real star of this film, however, is Andy Serkis, who gives life to Caesar, the chimpanzee who is torn between his love for humanity and his duty to his species--and whose performance is surely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Don't worry if this all sounds a bit hokey--it plays a lot better than it sounds. Add a star if you're a diehard \\"Apes\\" fan.

B0064T6LV8|5.0|The first game on my Kindle Fire. And it works FAR better than expected. In fact, I have not had any problems at all. A few ads, so who cares? There are ads everywhere, learn to disregard them. It works for me!

0385344228|5.0|Legal thrillers don't get any better than this.  The story that William Landay has crafted is a riveting tour-de-force of the genre, with a compelling crime at its center, and a family under siege at its heart.  Taking us from the time the crime was committed through the trial and aftermath along a route of serpentine events, stunning revelations, and surprising twists, this is crime-writing at its best.  I found it hard to put this book down, and made myself late for work and stayed up well past my bedtime in order to keep reading.<br /><br />Make a decision you won't regret:  read this book!
1451627289|5.0|I don't normally read Stephen King novels.  However, I was intrigued by the idea.  Within a few pages, I was completely immersed.  Am only a third of the way through and find it captivating, smart, complex.  But what works best is characters with whom you can identify and for whom you care....deeply.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app to pass the time kind of annoying that you have to unlock the games though... great app though
B001MEJY8W|1.0|Davids Lynch and Cronenberg are my two fave directors.  So, I thought this flick would fit the bill for an entertaining evening of frightfully titillating diversions.  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  Watching this movie all the way through was akin to getting loaded and testing to see how many times I could punch myself in the face until I broke my nose. (Okay, so I tried it once already.  Cheap tequila; what's to do.) This flick would best serve as a conversation piece in showing the most obscenely tasteless and despicable film on hand.  SPOILER ALERT: take what used to be a beautiful, young, defenseless woman and she gets her face and body beaten up by a man twice her size. The plot thickens!  It happens over and over and over and over again.  To be fair, though, this movie's artistic merit and its meticuluosly crafted impact on its intended audience should not be underestimated.  If you happen to be one of those who ceremoniously take an inkling to \\"self-gratification\\" while watching flicks depicting real life footage of heinous acts in a concentration camp, then this movie should definitely hit the sweet spot.  Not that there's anything wrong with that to those would-be five-star reviewers out there.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|...this one will hold you until the very end!  District 9 is one of the most imaginative and refreshing science-fiction movies released, and certainly a treat to behold on Blu-ray.  There IS a very noticeable difference between the DVD and Blu-ray experience, to which I highly recommend the Blu-ray experience.  The acting, pacing, and direction of District 9 is award-winning material, but the real star is the story.  The story behind the film is just as relevant today as it was when it was released in 2009.  That the film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa and not the overly used locations of New York or Los Angeles boosts the originality of the film.  Before buying, check out the review on Blu-ray.com to see if you'll want it,  [...]  Considering the quality of this release, you'll wish that all Blu-ray releases were managed by people as conscientious as those that worked on District 9.
0385344228|4.0|Andy Barber has been an assistant district attorney in a Massachusetts suburb.<br />He and his wife Laurie and son Jacob lived a fairly typical life, in this fairly<br />typical town. They were as shocked as anyone else when another young teenager, a friend<br />of Jacobs was found murdered one day.<br /><br />It never occurred to Andy to do anything but treat this case as he would any<br />murder case, and so he did not. He began to follow up on leads and look for<br />clues and work with the local police as he had always done. But it turned out that<br />this time it was different. This time, clues were uncovered that pointed to his own son.<br />He did not know how this could be happening, he knew his son was not a murderer. He knew<br />Jacob was just a kid with friends like any other kid, issues the same as any other kids issues<br />and he loved him. He loved Jacob, because Jacob was his son, and he was innocent.<br /><br />This is the story of the journey of a father whose first last and every effort was<br />going to be to protect his son, who he knew had been wrongly accused. Even if it meant<br />hiding evidence to dot it. But evidence does not always mean what it is is thought to mean,<br />does it? Sometimes mistakes are made and a jury would find Jacob not guilty, Andy was sure.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like the choices and especially the lay out. also the points system really encourage you to finish all the games!!!
B000WQWPKA|4.0|I have a version of this movie on LaserDisc and have enjoyed it immensely many times. I ordered this version because of my appreciation of the movie and a desire to get it all on one disc; the Laserdisc version takes three sides of two discs.<br /><br />This Blu-ray edition provides excellent sound and picture with heavy involvement of the surround speakers; I was very pleased with the results. This movie has aged well, it does a much better than average job of telling the story of an alien invasion. Since its release there have been numerous additional films based on this topic, most of which do not really measure up to ID4.<br /><br />I was impressed all over again with the depth of character development found in this film, especially in comparison with some of the newer releases on the subject. I found myself developing a concern all over again for the characters and sharing their moments of sadness and elation.<br /><br />The version I ordered is a single disc which Amazon sells for $8.99; it has the movie and five special features. For that price it's a great value for those who love the movie and is available with free shipping with Prime.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this traditional game is amazing on my Kindle Fire. Once you start playing it you wont be able to put it down. it also has tons of options!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I just started playing these games and I thought they were fun and entertaining. I'm glad I downloaded this app. if your bored this will keep you busy!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Being a fan of both, Avatar was an easy addition to my long-time wish list.  Knowing that this special edition was coming out when the first Blu-ray was released, I held off to buy this...one of my best Blu-ray decisions to date.  If you really want to be convinced on whether to pick this one up, visit Blu-ray.com and read their review on the disc.  You'll be back for it.  As a seasoned bargain shopper, I will say that if you're patient, keep checking back here and at other online retailers.  I was able to get mine brand new at $15, even though I'd still consider this edition a steal at $25.  Between the storyline, the acting, the cast, the music (I'm a film score fan, as well), and the direction of Jim Cameron, you'll want to show this one off to friends and family.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  To let you know whether my recommendation fits your taste, some of the best sci-fi/fantasy films I've seen in recent years (and purchased on Blu-ray) are District 9, \\"9\\", Star Trek, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and Inception.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has decent mini games for when you're really bored. I wouldnt spend money on it, but its okaay for it being free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Could use less coins to unlock games. Other than that it is a very quality app. job very well done
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ive ever played this is the kindle fire version plus you get some extra points

B004FOA84A|5.0|I lovet this game!  I couldn't play it a million times!  it is very difficult, so if you like challenges,  this is your game! I found it very hard , and that is what i loved the most about it. its very fun, you could play it with anyone!  personally I love mysteries,  so it is up my alley.  you should definitely get it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works great on my kindle fire. I play it regularly for down time and love the ease of it.I like all the options it allows and even my 10 year old cousin can play easily.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I gave this to my wife for Xmas and she couldn't be happier.  The 6 book organization is a little goofy, it would have made more sense to split it into 10 seasons.  Do not have any scratched discs that people have complained about, at least not yet.  If we discover something that won't play then will update review.  Besides that, its Friends!!  You can't really mess that up.  This was MUCH less expensive than buying each season separately.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101-in-1 games is really fun and sometimes challengeing. seems maybe to be more fun for mykids but they love it.
1451648537|5.0|Having lived myself through the computer and internet revolution, I was really thrilled to read the biography of Steve Jobs, one of the key players. Walter Isaacson does an excellent job in telling the unbiased, full story of Steve Jobs as an innovator, as a business man and as a person. Read this book and 'Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish'!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I remember playing the paid Fruit Ninjas app on the iPod Touch. It actually had nonlinear play. I would love to see that on the Andriod/Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Everything else is good. Colors are crisp and gameplay is smooth.

B003E8P9G0|4.0|I absolutely loved Riordan's series Percy Jackson and the Olympians; so I was truly anxious to settle down and read this one. Let me just say that I was not disappointed!    This is the first book in the Kane Chronicles and Rick Riordan has delivered yet another exciting, and fast paced story that will provoke your imagination and keep you glued to the pages!  This story focuses on Kane's siblings, with the characters exploring the dangerous yet exciting realm of the Egyptian Gods.  I couldn't put this down!  I also highly recommend [[ASIN:0982886586 The LightBridge Legacy ~ Destiny's Call]] by Elayne G. James, another extraordinary story that will captivate you.  One of my favorites yet!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so adicting and so fun!! I love it!! it has so many fun levels!! you should get it!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is off the hook.  this is awesome one hundred one games plus sixteen is my favorite app in the whole world
B005LB1MY6|5.0|The album was great from start to finish, every song feels like it could be a single. It's a departure from their first album but somehow this one sounds even better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game its so much fun there are so many mini games I'm this app. you must buy it.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This case was cheap and had good reviews. In addition, amazon has a great reputation so I wasn't hesitant to buy this set. It fits the phone perfectly, allows you to set it on its face with no worries, creates a nice grip, protects against cosmetic scathes and minor bumps and drops. I'd recommend it to anyone, even if you aren't being \\"budget conscious\\"!
B005FNJL7K|5.0|I can't do without the Lord of the Rings music/soundtracks (especially The Fellowship of the Ring), and the LOTR symphony is great as well. Howard Shore if one of the best!
B004FS1TLM|5.0|Bought as a gift and it arrived very quickly after the order was placed.  It was in very good condition.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this is a very cool app, i love the fact that i can combine photos of friends and family and send it to different social networks
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book was recommended to me a few times. The length, 936 pages was the reason it has taken me so many years to pick it up... I have a month break from school so I picked up a copy,  I'm now half way through this book and it's only been a week. I'm not usually engrossed in books or a fast reader. I love this book, it's So wonderful!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is really cool because you can play many games on one app!! you can play the games and unlock new ones aswell
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game, it gives me something to do!! I always seem yo hurt my ankles, so all I can do is lay around so this gives me something to do!!!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|If you have seen and like \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\", but you haven't seen the extended version/director's cut, it is a must see. Tells a whole other part of the story, and adds a lot to it without ruining a great movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game for kids and some adults that just love the challenge.  We all love it. Thanks
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great games. boredom no longer. there's really nothing bad about it. it does great on the kindle fire. LOVE IT!
0060873027|1.0|Years ago, I was reading a badly-written book while camping. It was so awful that I finally gave up and threw it in the campfire. \\"Micro\\" falls in the same fire-worthy category: it has a great premise, but the execution is terrible.  No one who's associated with this novel comes out looking good. I'd always liked Michael Crichton's books, but \\"Micro\\" was pretty far removed from his writing style. And Richard Preston's books have always been wonderful examples of well-researched and suspenseful writing. So what on earth happened here? The writing is a bad blend of both authors' styles, and it's not a good representation of either one. Did the publisher decide to cut costs by skimping on an editor? That's the only excuse I can come up with for releasing such an irritating book.  What do I mean by \\"irritating\\"? Well, the same word(s) appear over and over in adjoining sentences throughout the book. Since I listened to the audio version, I don't have specific examples on hand -- but let's just say that the following sentences come pretty close: \\"They went into the tunnel. The tunnel was dark and hot, with many turns. Pretty soon, the tunnel split into two tunnels, and they had to decide which tunnel to take. Ric thought it would be best to take the tunnel on the right.\\" Aaaaargh.  I'm sure that \\"Micro\\" was a huge time sink for Richard Preston to write. It's a crying shame that a good editor wasn't put on the project. It coulda been a contender.
B0061S073A|5.0|I have a kindle fire and this app is the best piece of mind ever. my two year old uses the kinked fire more than me with this app she can browse her own apps and no worries about online streaming or purchases.  thanks love it!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Exactly what I expected. Fits perfectly and feels high quality. Protects my screen but doesn't make the Kindle big and bulky.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I don't know why everyone is saying that it lags. Maybe you have to get a new device or better connection.  It works perfectly fine.
0553801473|2.0|I've read through all the books in this series and just finished this last one.  I have had this book for over 6 months since I had to keep putting it down and forcing myself to just finish the thing.  George you were on your way to being one of my favorite authors but with this last book I am so disappointed in the ending.  The last book really let me down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a pretty fun way to pass the time and its so easy to get coins through out the game
0385535139|4.0|I like Grisham because he tells a good story and is easy to read, nothing too complex or deep.  Perfect when you want an easy read at the beach or pool.  This story is the same formula, but very entertaining.
6304698682|4.0|It is pretty difficult to go wrong with a Clint Eastwood Western (especially post Sandra Locke) and Pale Rider is no exception.  The only reason that I only give this four stars, is that I tend to watch Unforgiven and The Outlaw Jose Wales more often.  A good addition to the Clint Eastwood video library.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love this case, it's light but sturdy.  The stand up function carries little importance for me.  I wanted something that added little weight and bulk but provides protection.  I have enough stuff in my purse and didn't want anything too big and this works great.  Had a defect in first Kindle received, when the replacement arrived I found out just how securely this case holds the Kindle as I had to struggle a little to get the other one out to put the new one in.  Shows how well it fits.  Great case, a good purchase.

B000001GOZ|3.0|My, oh, my...when will I ever learn my lesson? I have more performances of the Mahler 6 on CD than I can ever reasonably use. I have heard Boulez play Mahler live and on other recordings, and invariably found him correct, but uninspired. And yet I succumbed to temptation and ordered this performance of the sixth symphony. My action was based largely on the favorable comments here. I thought Boulez should have one more chance. And yes, many of the positive reviews here are right with respect to the precision and coherence of the conductor's effort. But when all is said and done, no matter how good the sound reproduction or the virtuosity of the orchestra, the fact remains that Boulez is a cold, bloodless Maher conductor, without soul or a true understanding of this miraculous music. Get the Szell recording. Get the Bernstein, even if he gets a little crazy in spots. Live a little!
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|I am not a big Jim Carrey or Ed Harris fan, but this is not your typical Jim Carrey comedy.  Although still very funny, it is a bit more intellectually interesting than typical comedy fare.  I would consider it somewhere in between Enemy of the State and The Mask (and wow that is a big difference).  So it is even more surprising that I give this a five star rating.  There is a lot of depth here that is unusual in 21st Century movies.  I completely agree with another reviewer that commented the musical score is amazing.  Even if you are not a Jim Carrey fan this is worth seeing.
0060245867|5.0|This is one of the cutest children books I've ever read! I think I enjoyed it more then my kid haha!

1426308469|5.0|My grandson, who is 4 years old has great interest on Dinosaurs.  I got the the \\"Kids First Big Book of Dinosaurs\\" not totally sure he would be ready for it. As usual, as grandparent we are protective, because some of the pictures could be a bit scary. Well, so far, he has been enjoying it thoroughly and learning new concepts about Dinosaurs.  It has been a great success!
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful, tragic, funny, and masterfully crafted piece of literature written by one of today's finest authors, John Green. Green explores the reality of living with disease and the nature of fate in the context of the teenage life in his newest novel and does so with an awesome literary prowess that will leave you staring at the page admiring the absolute majesty of how the words form together on the page, and at the same time desperately wanting more. I believe this book to be the best example of his work since his debut novel, [[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]], and this is high praise indeed. Like all Green books this book is profoundly meaningful, while also genuinely funny, and of course captures the honest truth of being a teenager (rough edges, cursing, and sexuality in all). If you're a teenager: read this book. If you used to be a teenager: read this book. If you have or had cancer: read this book. If you know someone who has or had cancer: read this book. If you're reading this review: you should probably read this book.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I saw the Movie today in German television and the makers are showing the problems that concerns me for a long time. I want to say thank you! to the movie makers. I'm glad to be in Germany with my little organic shop (Bio Shop)down the street and a one in anx bigger street (Berlin). I'm an engineer of environmental technology and it's true: If you eat organic food you decrease CO2 emitation so for your health and for your planet: act, please!
B005HSL626|4.0|it is fun when u have nothing 2 do. I like it!!! :) It Jethro perfect game especially tot little kids that are board it is a game that they could actually do :0)
B006SV2LWA|1.0|I am so glad I did not see this boring movie in the theater. It took me two days to get through it on video. This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are highly addictive and give you hours of entertainment, too much fun! Although some times they are tough it just makes you want to try again :T
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Awesome game. I love this game. It is really fun to play, which I do all the time. It is a way fun game for all ages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|muy burn juego para matar el tiempo, .y pasar un buen momento jugando solitario me ayuda a que me pase mas rapido el tiempo cuando estoy lejos de casa ......
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Games are HORRIBLE! You have to endure the misery of each one to continue unlocking further torture.  I have a renewed vision of Hell.. continually forced to play this game, only with a banjo and bagpipe soundtrack.  After all that misery, adds are everywhere, and every third play you are forced to view a fullscreen ad, one of which offered 4 million points if you would sign up for a discover card.  If youre consdering this one, my only advice is RUN!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|The game is pretty good for the most part (no bugs that I saw, simple enough for kids to figure out easily, etc.), but at times there were questions that I even had trouble solving, which suggests to me that the level of abstraction necessary to find the correct solution might be beyond.children at times.  This is probably something you'd have to help your kid with at times.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I was looking for a reasonable quality, lightweight, protective cover for my new Kindle Fire.  My wife has a similar cover for her Sony EReader and I hoped that this would be similar. I primarily use my Kindle at home and it does not need to be able to withstand being run over by a tank.  A leather cover would be far too bulky for my purpose as would a padded one. This cover appeared to meet all my requirements  I am NOT disappointed, in my opinion it's an excellent product.  It feels good in my hand, has a quality finish, completely covers the device, it fits great and looks great. The cover has a soft finish which will not scratch the screen and folds in half to prop the Fire up for use on a table or something and it works great, I've had no problems with it.  The elastic strap retains the cover either open of closed and is an elegant solution with no moving parts to break.  I love it, it looks good, feels good and meets MY requirements which is all that matters to me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game was pretty fun. the only thing that annoyed ne was all.of the ads. plus you have.tobunlock all the games and that is boring
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun and entertaining app. kept me going for hours. highly recommended. it is fun and is always changing so you don't get bored. it can get frustrating but it is a great time spent.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game is very reminiscent of games like the Myst series, 7th Guest and 11th Hour.  Its a bit quirky and the storyline is a bit obtuse which leaves one with a very loose idea of where to look next in some areas.  In games like this the fun is all in the delivery, the story unfolding.  Unfortunately thats where this one falls short... and speaking of short.. if the delivery were better and the clues/solutions a bit more logical this game would take all of about 10 minutes to play though.  I wish I could give this a 5 star rating but even though it is entertaining and has a good atmosphere it just leaves you wishing for more. But the creators have my sincere appreciation and applause. I wish more gaming companies would work to supply the fans of this genre with hours and hours of entertaining deduction.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I received this DVD set for Christmas and have been enthralled with it from the beginning.  The interviews, recording outtakes, and rare film clips are worth it alone.  But you do get an overall impression of how much or little the experience meant to at least the 3 (at that time) remaining Beatles.  I think Paul has come to embrace and relish the music they did; I sometimes got the impression George could have done without much of the experience; and I was touched by Ringo's recollections.  There were few memories Ringo talked about in a negative way.  He said he loved going to the various places, and loved this and that.  He seemed to really appreciate the closeness and friendship the 4 of them had, getting emotional at one point when he said it was 4 guys who just really loved each other.  I also found the interviews with George Martin especially valuable.  His unique perspective on their music and growth was very interesting to me.  If you're a Beatles fan, you will enjoy this.
B00425S1H8|5.0|The cable for a Magellan Sportrak GPS receiver has the old db-9 serial plug on it and this cable/adapter works to connect it to a Windows 7 USB port. Quality build, works, and a good value.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is so addictive. It is a great way to pass time. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys card games.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't know why people are complaining so much. This game is exactly what it says it is. No one is trying to get one over. Its a fun little time waster. I like it.
B004LWZW7E|1.0|This is one boring movie! Every scene is like a WTF scene! It gets old fast! No action, crappy script and it goes nowhere. Every time, you want something to happen and it never does. Terrible terrible movie. Fine actors gone to waste. No emotions, no substance. This whole movie could have been half its length if the scenes didn't drag on. It was very repetitive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if you upgrade it deleted all your progress but other than that great game! so never ever upgrade! so yea bye!
B00003CXE7|4.0|This is a good movie. It has a enjoyable story to it. I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy watching Gladiator.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|I have watched the Planet Earth series when it came out a few years ago and I received the special edition as a holiday gift. I just finished watching the first special feature about the snow leopard and it was terrific. It was the first time they have shot such up close and personal footage about this rare creature. The other special features are intriguing enough to go for this purchase. If you are a fan of other BBC Earth productions, don't hesitate picking this one up even if you own the original Planet Earth. Totally worth it!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works great with Kindle Fire, speed is impressive!  Only problem is that all desktop icons are rearranged when I exit.
B00001ODGR|4.0|Overall, this is a very good show and definitely worth buying.  The best part is the songs are very tight to the original (except Grand Illusion) and the voices are spot on!  Their play is close to perfection.  The video is good but quality is not as good as some others.  The audio overall is very good fidelity, but a bit heavy on the base.  These down comments are factual but should not be taken in any way as a reason not to enjoy this fine concert.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this game! it is so addicting, I can never go to sleep at night I just keep playing more games!!!! You should DEFENITLY try this game out!!! ;) &lt;3
B00005ATQF|2.0|First time I watch this movie was with my husband. It was ok. I wasn't that into it. I just finished watching it and this time it was better. Very interesting...
1451648537|5.0|This is the longest biography that I have read ans well worth it. A terrific job by Walter Isaacson to give us a glimpse of one of the most influential people of all time. Isaacson does a terrific job to bring out Steve Job's extremely complex personality and does not try to judge his actions. The send coming of Steve Jobs is the best part of the book and better than anything a business book can tell you. Reading through it gave me a glimpse of the passion & perfection of a rare genius! Grab a copy for your bookshelf.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|I love these movies, they mix action, horror, and a bit of comedy, I like the 1st and the 3rd the best, I was thrilled to find them on Amazon I would recommend this to anyone.
B005FMZVLQ|2.0|I've been tempted to buy an Invicta watch but I'm put off by the high list price to sale price ratio. There is no way someone is going to sell a watch that is worth $700.00 for $95.00.  It's like buying a Rolex at a gas station.  It must be Chinese junk.  I think I'll take a pass and spend my money on a trusted name like Citizen or Bulova Accutron.  I used to think Seiko watches were good quality until I bought one for $400.00 that died after two years.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love solitaire so mindless but so much fun. love this version so easy to play.! ! !! ! ! ! ! !! !!
0385737955|5.0|Okay first of all, I randomly found this book at a thrift store in humboldt. It was $2.50 and I thought I would try it out. I started reading it and I got hooked! This book constantly has you wondering what will happen next. I ordered the next two books and finished them within a week. I recommend that everyone read this series. James Dashner: YOU ARE A GENIUS. Amazing, amazing, amazing trilogy. Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun game, great way to kill time. Some games are more fun than others. Even more fun if you challenge someone and play back and forth to beat high scores.
0525478817|5.0|This book is amazing in that, as you are reading it, you pause and think to yourself, \\"everyone should read this book. People need to know this story.\\" It doesn't matter that it's a fictional piece, because so much in this book touches upon the truth in the world. It does so in a way that everyone can relate with, even if you don't have a terminal illness or even know anyone with one.   Now that I've finished it, I just want to give it out to everyone I know and make them read it because it needs to be read. This is the type of book that should be taught in schools, but would be best if read in your own leisure and privacy with your own thoughts to reflect upon it. It will touch you on a personal level and teach you to take a moment and just appreciate life, the universe, and everything.
0689835604|4.0|My 16 month old and I like this book with the flaps and we actually have another one by the same company called Daddy and me, but my complaint with both books is that the flaps that make this book so fun and interesting for my toddler are also the biggest problem. The flaps are so big, that they get bent really easily.  The story is very simple indicating it is meant for young children, but making the flaps so big indicates the publisher does not really understand the behavior of young children. Both of our books have bent flaps and I keep these books on a high shelf where he can't get the books on his own. Imagine if these books were with his others that he has complete access to! They would be completely demolished!
B004SKIPXW|5.0|I bought this movie to test out my Samsung 3D tv. It is awesome, this movie was made to be seen in 3D, everything comes out at you like it should. The movie is a great action flick, and has a nice plot. I recommend it if you want great 3D and action.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a good time passer for me and my little cousin loves it and it keeps him busy.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|I am happy with the timely arrival of this product. I received it as promised. My son enjoyed my gift to him.
B00004U28G|4.0|Fun group road picture based on Brock Yates[[ASIN:0760316333 Cannonball!: World's  Greatest Outlaw Road Race]] about an odd collection of characters to race accross the country.  Roger Moore, Jamie Farr, Farrah, Burt Reynolds, Dom Delouis, Jackie Chan, Peter Fonda, Burt Convey, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Tillis all with their own special verhicles and Andrian Barbo with a Lamborghini Countach. Fun and Funny.  The out takes at the end are equally funny.
0525478817|5.0|A wonderful telling of a story that seems impossible to tell. John Green tells the story of the heartbreak involved in cancer in a way that has never been done before. This book is a roller coaster that will leave you breathless.
B004K4IZ54|2.0|I bought this to see on my Samsung 3D tv. I have seen 2 other movies on my tv, imax deep sea and drive angry. This is horrible!!! I was shocked because I love the movie in regular format. The first problem is that as the movie goes, it changes screen size and from 2D to 3D which is very annoying. The 3D doesnt come out like it should, its more of a deep 3D which I can make anything on my Samsung tv do that. Don't waste your money on this one, hopefully I will get a descent trade in value.
B002BWP49C|5.0|The movies is never as good as the book, however, once you get into the movie you see how they fits the important details and it all makes sense. I am happy that they have decided to make this a two part movie.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|useful app. thanks for making it free. could use some harder maths, like calculus. :) Quite worth having on your device.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Anthony Hopkins plays the role of a genius engineer who murders his wife after learning of her affair with a police hostage negotiator. Ryan Gosling is an equally talented young D.A. about to move up in the legal profession, but wants to finish this case against Hopkins that he blundered on at the beginning, battling against Hopkins acting as his own lawyer. The problem - Hopkins has somehow made the murder weapon (gun) disappear, and the hostage negotiator's having been Hopkins wife's lover, as well as assulting Hopkins, renders Hopkins confessions inadmissable. Hopkins almost gets away with the murder via a 'double jeopardy' defense. Interesting from start to finish.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Lots of fun for kids, my son loved the pinch and zoom.  We had a blast going though all the levels.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book is a little bit too long, however, the author creates a great connection with all the stories about Steve Jobs' life.  I was really amazed that despite all the success he achieved, his interior demons were very profound and left scars in him.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love all the features.  I only wish the audio could be used offline for traveling.  Audio is the best Ive ever heard.

B0042QNP2S|5.0|THE TRUCK ARRIVED IN GREAT CONDITION.  PURCHASED FOR OUR 3.5 YEAR OLD GRANDSON FOR CHRISTMAS.  THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THE PARTS, IT WORKED AS DESCRIBED.  HE USED CROSS CUT SHREDDED PAPER FOR THE GARBAGE WHICH WORKED PERFECTLY, HOWEVER, I WOULD RECOMMEND USING THE NORMAL CUT SHREDDED PAPER.  THE CROSS CUT CLINGS TO CLOTHING MORE THAN THE LONGER SHREDS.  I GAVE 5 STARS FOR EDUCATIONAL VALUE BECAUSE OF THE CREATIVE PLAY IT OFFERS DUE TO ITS OPERATION JUST LIKE A REAL GARBAGE TRUCK.  MY 4 STAR RATING FOR DURABILITY IS BASED ON BEING UNSURE OF HOW EACH CHILD WILL ROLE PLAY WITH THE TRUCK.  IF YOUR CHILD PLAYS ROUGH WITH THEIR TOYS/BANGING THEM AROUND A LOT, BECAUSE OF THE REALISTIC DETAILING ON THE TRUCK, SOME PARTS MIGHT CRACK OR BREAK OFF. I TRIED TO CHANGE THE 3 STAR TO 4 STAR FOR DURABILITY AND IT WOULD NOT UPDATE.  OUR GRANDSON LOVES THIS TRUCK AND SPENDS HOURS PLAYING WITH IT.  I ALSO ORDERED A BRUDER FIGURE THAT IS MADE TO FIT INSIDE THE TRUCK AS WELL AS STAND ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRUCK.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND SELLER.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|I have a very small living room so I was glad to hear about the zoom making it easier to play games with the kinect while needing less room.  Like many other reviews that I have been reading, this is ok for adults, but is useless for kids.  It does make the room appear larger and father away which in turn makes everyone a little shorter and harder to detect if they are small to begin with.  My 4year old daughter is 40\\" which is the height that kinect claims to be able to detect.  It was fine for her to play before the zoom.  Now, even when we remove the lens it seems as if the kinect is confused and cannot \\"see\\" all(most) of her movements.  I wish that we didn't buy it.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|Love this game, bought it on my phone  n got addicted.  Only draw back is there isn't  enough stages. Finished the whole game in less than a wk!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games aren't that good quality and kinds lame and simple..... but they are very very adicting.  its also really good cause its free.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love love love this ap. makes file sharing and cloud utility so much easier and very convenient. great for writers on the go.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great and intuitive time killer game.  Don't care for skipping past ads on every game but worth it overall in my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are great, but there is a constant flow of ads. The games remind me of Wario Ware and the mini games of Mario Party.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|The music is great. This guy get's permanently friendzoned in this charming movie about people we can't have who we long for. Every guy will related to this movie, the acting is great.

B006BDHAX0|2.0|I enjoyed playing this game, but it shuts down every two or three games.  If you are in the middle of a game when it shuts down that game is gone.  I got it as a free app-of-the-day, so I'm not out any money.  Because of the problems, I have removed it from my Kindle Fire.  I would consider purchasing it if the bugs were worked out.
0439023513|5.0|I cannot believe how many people have given this book bad reviews.  I read some of the reviews and understand how they feel, but then I think 'they put so much effort and specifics in their review, it is obvious that they too were totally engaged in this story.'  There are so many \\"Spoiler alerts\\" that the critics can't help but talk about what happened.  Mocking Jay draws out your emotions, it makes you think, it makes you gasp, it makes you keep reading and in the end you just want to talk to someone else who's read the book.  You feel you have to talk to someone else who knows these characters the way you do. Collins has evoked anger from some at how she ends her series, but it's her story not ours and it's an amazing one.  It's a story that will make you think and you will want to discuss with others.  You really do need to read the first two books first or it won't mean as much to you.  I've totally enjoyed getting to know Katniss from begining to end.  I think all of us who read this series are sad that it's over and must admit that it's one of the best trilogies ever written.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this has been such a fun game to have as u earn new ones so u have lots of options.  lots of fun for both kids and adults.
0307477479|2.0|If you think of this as a collection of short stories, it's manageable. But as a novel, the whole thing is a mess. Just because a book wins a bunch of awards certainly does not make it readable, or even interesting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Why complain about a free app. These games are simple and some may even remind you of childhood games. I don't have any cimplaints so far. Don't think I will in the future.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This is an amazingly beautiful app that is packed full of information.  I got this as the free app-of-the-day, but paying 99 cents is a steal for what you're getting with this app.  The graphics are stunning.

B004QK5N5W|5.0|I received this yesterday and tried it out with my iPad 2 today... Both Netflix and Hulu work fine.  As far as I can tell, its a perfect mirror so everything can be seen on my HDTV through this adapter. The charging pass-through works fine.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone with an iPad 2 and an HDTV!!

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Funny how the two worst major releases of 2011 boiled down to rock legends going outside the box, and creating something that came off as some mean-spirited joke.  The two contenders I am speaking of is Lou Reed/Metallica's \\"Lulu\\", and Mick Jagger's supergroup, Superheavy. However, I declare this one as the worse of two evils.  To me, Lou Reed always had one of the most unappealing voices in rock, but he was able to craft enough brilliant songs in his career for me to forgive him for his shortcomings. On \\"Lulu\\", he sounds like Johnny Cash had just woken up from a drunken binge, and decided to read some repetitive lyrics over repetitive heavy music that rarely fits what is being read.  Picture this format going on for roughly an hour and a half, and that's what you got here.  Metallica sounds as if they admire Lou too much to admit that this idea could only be created by a man who has completely lost his mind, and offered up some riffs that weren't good enough to even be used on their St Anger release.  This is not art...this is not coherent music...this is not enjoyable.  Lulu is poo-poo, and I refuse to offer a sophisticated criticism beyond that because both artists should be ashamed of themselves to unleash this garbage.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it blab blab blab blab Noah Anitra if os his ours theirs we can do it if we try and suceed beleile on yourself never give up you can do it peace to the world.I want Ny 250000 points

B003B5M0PO|5.0|At times, I found myself so enveloped in Joey's story that I completely forgot that this book was meant for children. I found the reflection on war through Joey's eyes to be devastatingly beautiful and touching. Although there were a few moments when I was brought to laughter, I was often brought to tears by the love Joey has for Albert and his other caregivers. Like children, animals are innocent, pure beings, which, I believe, the author captures perfectly without making Joey over-the-top naive. I was glad to see that the author did not dumb down Joey to the point where reading became cumbersome and irritating, which can sometimes be associated with childrens' books. Horses are smart animals and I think that making Joey as perceptive as he is was a smart choice.   I was also impressed by how the author handled Joey's interactions with the Germans. I think it is good to explain to children how, at the time, both sides thought they were doing what was right, even though retrospect has proven differently. Most importantly, this novel shows children how horrible war is for all involved. Furthermore, as an animal lover, I am slightly ashamed that I have never considered the horse casualties in World War I.  This is a wonderful book, which everyone should read! I ardently hope adults are not prejudice towards the \\"childrens'\\" classification and I hope that parents are not hesitant towards the war content.
B003UV6W30|5.0|I have the regular and the deluxe edition and I must say they are both great but I think this edition is much better.  The spanish songs are together and the english singles released are together. It makes more sense. He's my favorite singer and writer for a reason.  He'll always be #1 and even his father agrees.  Check out the album if you're a fan and you'll love it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has a nice variety of time passing minigames. Good way to consume time. Enjoyable and easy to understand.
B006FLGBGA|5.0|Rise Of The Planet of the Apes has the most realistic special effects of any other movie I've seen.  James Franco portrays Ceasar's owner, who is responsible for the ape's extreme intelligence. Andy Serkis plays Ceasar by the process of advanced motion capture and does an amazing job.  You can almost believe the apes are real.  The title is misleading, in that it seems to indicate this movie is a continuation of Planet of the Apes but is in no way related.  I enjoyed the movie and thought the acting was very good.  Andy Serkis should receive an award for performing the motion capture in this movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is good it give u something different to play everytime the only thing I dnt like is that you have to use ur points to unlock different games
B000H6SXMY|5.0|My boyfriend bought me this as part of my Christmas present. I love this show and have been watching it all the time. The packaging of the series is really nice. If you bought the seasons individually, they would take up so much more space.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Yes, the plot is utter nonsense, but I must admit:  Whoever was responsible for this movie's dance sequences is an utter genius.  The dancing alone is enough to see this clever and funny animated movie.  Another strong point is the dynamic between Puss and Humpty Dumpty.  Their rivalry between these two best friends, brothers, and comrade-at-arms is so childish and petty that it's actually endearing.  In this movie, Zach Galifianakis shows that while he can't play real people without being annoying, he can play a bad egg pretty well.
0312370849|3.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" tells the story of a young Jewish girl who experienced numerous horrors at the hands of the French police during World War II, and a woman who investigates Sarah's past some 60 years later.<br /><br />Here's the thing about this book...the writing itself is very good, and the story unfolds rapidly and continues at the same swift pace throughout the course of the novel. It never lost my interest. But overall, the story was way too contrived. Every aspect of the plot and the characters just seemed too scripted, and in a lot of cases predictable. It took away from the heart of the story, which is supposed to honor the thousands of lives lost during this often overlooked period in French history.<br /><br />The book is also overwhelmingly depressing...now obviously, a book about the Holocaust isn't going to be all giggles and kisses, but some of the most depressing parts of the book revolve around Julia's character, the woman who is researching Sarah's history. It's just a little too much all at once. Finally, the end seems forced, rushed, and just plain stupid.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay book and a pretty quick read, but I was left feeling disappointed by it. I think \\"Sarah's Key\\" had the potential to be a really great book, but it ended up just a mediocre one.
0525478817|5.0|I have never felt so incredibly overwhelmed by any other novel.  I laughed, cried, smiled, sighed...And sometimes all of that happened at once. This book is something special, no matter how trite that may sound.  This book touched me. And it feels like the very best gift.  The characters are lively and fresh.  The story line, which should be utterly depressing, comes with a lot of hope and inspiration.  The dialogue is fantastic...  I cannot say enough good things about TFiOS. I cannot come up with adequate words to express what this book means to me.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Can access your computer and have full control anywhere.  Have seen no issues.  Extremely easy to use.  Even if network resets on home network, computer will automatically reestablish connection.  Great app!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This movie is great... good historical perspective on the period of WW2.  One of those movies that keeps providing great perspective on what happened to people during this time of strife and pain.  The book is also good.  Everyone ought to consider seeing this movie.  Subtitles are not difficult to follow, and those who are French-speaking...  it is a joy to see a film in French.  Well worth the price!!
B003MYYJD0|5.0|It was a present for my dad and he love it very much! The product came on time and is beautiful
B004UID2LC|4.0|Does exactly what it sets out to do: help you download either music &amp;/or videos.  I only held off on a 5 star rating as there is no preview option.  This app really deserves a 4.5 stars though!

081297381X|3.0|Taleb is an insightful dude, but at times I had to resist the urge to hurl this book across the room.  I appreciate his dedication to skepticism - I'm a bit of a sucker myself ... something I'm working on - but he takes it too far at times.<br /><br />I did end up finishing the book, and though I found it a frustrating read, I'm glad I read it.  The thing you can't really get around is that he's just so right, and has the track record to prove it.<br /><br />I'd especially recommend the book to people starting to think about investing for the first time.  You won't find any concrete advice in this book, other than \\"don't take advice from anyone\\", but there are some very large and important concepts that Taleb gets into that really expand your viewpoint.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|None of them are really that good. Really disappointing. I was hoping that there was more to the game, but there really wasn't
B004SBBDB2|2.0|The connection to the Ipod Touch 4th Gen. did not feel like it locked in. The connection to the Ipod was very loose and cheap feeling. The connectors to the TV are confussing. Most people when they look behind the TV it is dark and the red connectors for video and audio are confussing. Also the cable just did not work. I had some videos on my Ipod  it said it was playing it to the TV but I got nothing on the TV. The same thing occured with multiple TVs. The description says it works with \\"Ipod\\" but does not say \\"Ipod Touch 4th Generation\\". I do not know about other Apple devices but this does not work with Ipod Touch 4th Generation with Version 5.0.1. DO NOT USE WITH IPOD TOUCH.

B004A8ZWXS|3.0|Michael Morpurgo wrote This [[ASIN:1405226668 classic children's story]] which found its way to the stage as an [[ASIN:B002QW7J6S amazing play]]: now Stephen Spielberg has brought it to the big screen.<br /><br />The story itself deals with the strength of equine and human spirits in the face of what are now the almost unimaginable privations of the First World War. Spielberg is well qualified to deal with such subjects: I have just finished watching [[ASIN:B003QP47RS The Pacific]] and it's interesting to make the comparison. Typically Spielbergian camera shots abound, the choreographing of the battlefield scenes is exquisite and the attention to military details is obvious. Nevertheless this is, unlike [[ASIN:B00004Y3NM Saving Private Ryan]]for instance, a family film and while it doesn't shy away from the nastiness of the war, it remains sensitive to its younger audience members. I did take exception to Albert's rather miraculous recovery from what must obviously have been a fairly light gassing and I wondered at the sight of a Devonshire infantry regiment going \\"over the top\\" to the accompaniment of the bagpipes.<br /><br />While the camerawork is excellent, the same cannot be said of other aspects of the production, with some glaring continuity errors and some appaling lighting work with characters casting three or four shadows in many scenes. Perhaps I'm too harsh and younger viewers may not notice these things.<br /><br />My wife observed that the film remained faithful to the original story and while some inevitable editing had taken place, the main story elements were preserved and there was little mucking about from the screenwriters.  I however I felt that the film tended to lose the book's focus on Joey the horse and the film was as much, if not more, about the human characters (Albert in particular).<br /><br />In the end, this is a decent piece of cinematic story telling, engaging, exciting and emotional. It is quite appropriate for younger viewers but they will need some adult help in understanding the issues raised. To a more critical eye however, it's clear that Spielberg took his eye off the ball with this one and it's by no means one of his best. I guess it will depend on the viewer but I found it to be a bit of a disappointment after the hype. My wife enjoyed it far more than I did.<br /><br />And neither of us cried!rstanding the issues raised.

B002GJT4XM|1.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who loves these movies and books. She especially liked that they come with a digital copy as well. What they don't tell you is that the digital copy for this expired in 2010. If you're buying for all the aspects advertised, know before hand that you'll be shorted the digital copy.
B0030E1XJU|1.0|Bought this for my 7 yr old brother, First off Ham the pig is NOT included! None of the links would work and its very fragile one wrong move and nothing would work! Not worth the money.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|There's really no catch with this app! You earn points by playing the games and use the point to unlock new and different games! FREE!!!
B00664AM5C|1.0|Yes, there are a lot of stars but overall this movie was a DUD; very choppy and boring. While it might have some good moments, it didn't hold my interest at all; my husband actually walked out of the room to play video games.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|glad you are allowed to earn points to open new games instead of spending money on this app. nice feature.
B004LGPBZI|4.0|And I would say I love music Oasis too and have all the major releases. I would not agree as some say, that this does not sound like oasis. Yes it is more retro then the recent, so then closer to the early days. I had thought that Noel was more the driving force behind Oasis, but this release has me thinking that Liam Gallagher is as strong, in song writing anyway. I find that Noel's release, High Flying Birds, falls a bit short of this, a bit drab after a while, with 'Different Gear Still Speeding' being more varied and adventurous. So if you put the two together, you would have one heck of an Oasis album.
B0042RJWTC|2.0|So far at least 3 disks have  been defective. I felt the gift I gave was not up to  Amazon's reputation. The packaging was OK but some of the disks were not in the album correctly
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|This movie was great on all levels.  Brilliant acting by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill.  Great extras on the blu-ray version.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I bought the G13 to replace my 5 yr old Nostromo N52.  The keys are very responsive and I like the LCD screen. I also like that you can customize just about everything on the pad including the  color of the back lighting.  I have large hands and the G13 fits like a glove. All of the keys are within easy reach. The N52 often left me cramping after long sessions, but the G13 does not.  The only negative I can think of is that aren't as many applets out there as I thought there would be for the LCD screen.  All in all a great gameboard.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some of the games are silly but the app works good n its fun n kills time if u r bored! it never forces close you can unlock new levels by getting points
145551389X|5.0|This book is massive. Endless amount of amazing photos, much of them previously unreleased. If you're a Gaga fan, you will fall in love with this book.  Only con: doesn't include any text with the photos. A bit of a disappointment, but besides that I love this book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games! really helps to pass the time. love playing on my kindle fire! a must down load for everyone!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty entertaining. It's hard to complain when it's free, but some of the games are not fun at all. I still recommend it though.
0470876417|5.0|This is a great book. A totally new way of approaching the traditional business model. It's very approachable and easy to follow, even for a non-MBA
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just what I was looking for, and more.it was a challenge for everyone that played it. plus it was free.

0307269752|2.0|If you see all the hype but then read the book you must wonder what the excitement is all about. Then, if you then see the (first) movie, you finally get what it is all about: aberrant sex, straight sex, adolescent rebellion, unrequited love, harsh winter weather, revenge, and a dysfunctional family. Could this be a 1870 winter in Nebraska as seen by Robert Frost? No, it is 590 tedious pages (Vintage Crime pocketbook) of overly complicated wanderings that delve into what Hollywood and its reliable audience of 13-year-olds consider to be entertainment -- including a leftover Nazi serial killer. Author Stieg Larsson was first a best-seller in Sweden, the well-known land of frivolity and gaiety where the sun does not rise high in winter, if at all. Grim fodder for Swedish insomniacs, the book was then translated into a best-seller across Europe. Could trendy New York and dysfunctional literary critics be far behind? If you must read it, buy your copy used.<br />Chet Nagle  [...]
B002RKRSV0|3.0|With my new iPad, I was very interested in downloading some \\"freebies.\\"  One thing I am very interested in is whether I should be downloading books with Kindle (the app) or iBooks (in iTunes).    Well, both versions have pros and cons.  For this book, I went iBooks.    Both versions have identical text (I believe the text is from Gutenberg) but the formatting on both DRIVES ME CRAZY!  My biggest complaint with the Kindle is the wide amount of space between paragraphs. Every paragraph is followed by TWO BLANK LINES.  Even reducing the font doesn't make a difference...  The iBooks version, however, doesn't use \\"smart\\" quotes and the dashes are merely two hyphens rather than the unbroken longer dash. (the 'm\\"dash).  The paragraph indent space also varies, which drives me crazy too.  It also seems like apostrophes are missing ...
B004H1V5RU|4.0|When I first saw this maze game I thought that it would be too frustrating for the kids and that they would just put it down and give up trying to find a way to solve the puzzle. Much to my surprise they accepted the challenge of this maze and keep going back to try and find another way to Rule the Maze!Not easy but lots of fun!
B0060ZJ74O|1.0|I can't tell you anything about the movie because silly me thought that I would be able to watch it on my laptop for an upcoming trip.  Ultraviolet is the most un-user-intuitve, unfriendly, un-take-it-anywhere thing to be thrown at us loyal movie buyers.  I have never been so upset about any move purchase.  I sent Sony a complaint as well and I told them I would never buy another ultraviolet move from them again.  They should state on their \\"watch it anywhere title\\" that what that means is anywhere but your own media library where you watch ALL OF YOUR OTHER CONTENT THAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED FROM THEM!  I need to install some random studio app viewer? It is bad enough I have to down load it at all!  Where is my instant transfer?  I don't have time to let a file download for 4 -12 hours.  I would buy it from a digital seller if that is what I wanted.  You studios got us hooked on buying the BD/DVD/3D-BD/and Instant transfer disc all in one complete package.  WHO TOLD YOU WE NEED THIS SHAM PUT UPON US!  If you want to give us streaming, fine, but call it that, cause that is all that ultra-violet is good for... and guess what I DON'T NEED A SEPARATE STEAM AVENUE!  That trail has already been blazed by Amazon, Apple, Netflix, etc...  GIVE ME BACK MY DIGITAL COPY WITH BD!
1601253788|5.0|A guy named Jakub Jaraczewski has a better review than mine, so read his.<br /><br />I love this new bestiary.  The first Bestiary was ok, but copyright problems hit me hard with some of my favorite monsters vanishing from the game.  The second Bestiary was pretty cool; it added some things that I liked and I use it as often as the classic Bestiary.  Then I got the Froggod Games Tome Of Horrors, and it was about as cool as the second Bestiary, but about three times the size and four times the cost.<br /><br />But this third Bestiary...<br /><br />As others have already pointed out, this is a tour of mythology from around the world.  And, in the case of my home grown world the creatures added in this new Bestiary all fall neatly into the grand cosmic plans I've already laid down.  It's like Paizo wrote this book just for my current campaign and for no one else. How can I not like it?<br /><br />Overall it has a nice balance of monsters for all character levels, which is good.  I seem to remember that Gygax's Monster Manual II had very little for low level players in it.  I certainly hope that Bestiary 4 continues in the same vein as Beastiary 3.
0439023491|5.0|I bought this book twice from amazon.com: one of the times was to read it instantly on my iPhone because I was too impatient to wait for the hard copies I ordered to arrive at my house! Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop!  Then I needed to have the next one. Right away. It took me about 12 hours to read both books back to back; that's how amazing they were.  Then my hard copies arrived and I read them again.
B004I744AS|4.0|Great for doing vocabulary assignments in my English classes! This may be the best app for directly looking up a word. Four stars because of the UI with all the ads but still totally worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good and I regimens it to everyone that likes games it is very very very very very very very good
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I thought this App would be fun, but its full of bugs and the quality is awful.  The controls are slow reacting, and the whole unlocking thing is a big waste of time.  Stupidest App Ever.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a nice way to relax while exercising your brain. The puzzles require a certain amount of forethought and planning, but if one is ever seemingly unsolvable the lovely little hint button comes in quite handy.
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|The thought of escaping from the sordid present into an idealized \\"golden age,\\" is hardly a new one.  The movie approaches this gimmick with a lighthearted excitement and at first I was happy to be along for the ride.  The famous writers we encounter, especially Stein and Hemingway, keep the pacing strong and the audience amused.  Still, there is no escape from the utter lack of chemistry between Wilson and Cotillard, or their boring characters.  Luckily the scenery of Paris is gorgeous and much more interesting than the principle actors.
1416550550|4.0|I felt that my to-read list had run dry, and there were no more good books to read. I stumbled upon this book on one of the lists on goodreads. I'm so glad I did. I absolutely loved it! It was beautifully written. It feels like a fairy tale for grown ups. I read it while going through some hard times -- fire evacuations, among other things. This book helped me escape. It is pretty long, but I thought it was worth it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|for a time waster this game is good otherwise not.  good game for kids. mature gamers who want a real challenge may want a different game.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I believe all the good review are old ones, after update, a lot of ads coming out. It's just too much ads not a normal person can play with.<br />Also they are try to disable ppl review their app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games, some are to.easy but still enjoyable. I like that you have to beat each game to move on in the game.
0439023513|3.0|I do love this series. The ending wasn't quite as satisfying as I would like. But, it was a good series. I think it has a good message about humankind, and the horrors we are capable of if we're not careful.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game rules the black bird rocks! I love birdies Go Bird Bird Bird Go Bird.I.love angry birds!!!  Angry Bird oh ya
B0058VW36U|5.0|HTC Incredible2 Saved to SD card. It is a simple swipe and tap game to manuver a candy into the mouth of a creature. New challenges as levels progress. I found the music annoying but the other sounds actually add to the game. Chomp Chomp Chomp !
B004LWZVZC|5.0|Very good video with excellent historical content!! Liked that the historical account was included with the movie. Don't hesitate to buy.
1416550534|2.0|I liked the first half, and then it went down hill. I didn't like the affair, even though (thankfully) there were no lurid details, and the consequences of it were pretty awful. Still, in some ways the book made it seem like it was OK. The ending was what knocked the book down to two stars for me. I definitely did not like this book as well as The Forgotten Garden. I still very much enjoy this author's style of writing, and I will probably keep reading her books.
B005KELS6Q|3.0|I have a kindle touch and this fits perfectly and works great for protecting the kindle while I throw it in my purse. I especially loved the rubber grip part. Feels nice in your hand and gives you a secure hold. The problem is that this is not machine washable and it get dirty and even after trying to hand wash I can't get the dirt to come out. Oh, and just as a note the pink is a very bright pink.

0553582461|5.0|Robin Hobb's Farseer & Tawny Man trilogies are among my coming-of-age fantasy favorites along with Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicle and Peter V. Brett's Demon Cycle. Ms. Hobb writes exceptionally well, frequently evoking deep emotions. Her strong first-person narrative, endearing characters, engaging story and exciting magic (the \\"Wit\\" & the \\"Skill\\" instead of sorcery) made my reading experience feel real. It isn't perfect as there is a bit of padding and repetition, (understandably) not much action, \\"assassin\\" in the titles may not necessarily match reader expectations, and the pace may feel somewhat slow.  The Farseer Trilogy (Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin & Assassin's Quest): Presents a simple yet inspiring story of an abandoned boy, an illegitimate heir talented in both Wit (abhorred beast magic) and Skill (magic to send thoughts, usually found only in those of royal blood), loyal to his king in the time of the Red Ship War. It is at mid-series when Fitz bonds with an unlikely creature that the Wit magic begins to shine. Readers not continuing onto The Tawny Man may be left disappointed since the ending is closed in only a few pages appearing rushed (as it is structured with a sequel in mind) and depressed from Fitz's losses (better appreciated in the sequel).  The Tawny Man Trilogy (Fool's Errand, Golden Fool & Fool's Fate): Direct sequel to The Farseer Trilogy. Here lies the true ending to Fitz's tale, explains his connection to the Fool, retells post-war events, and expands beyond the Six Duchies kingdom. After fifteen years, Fitz returns as a lowly servant to rescue his lost prince and then slay a dragon. Very moving are his journey with his Wit companion, his reunion with his surrogate mother, and most especially his coded message for his guardian (the stablemaster) in a Skill dream.  I couldn't resist reading this series non-stop and I am fortunate to find it in a time when all six books have already been published. Overall, it's quite enjoyable, very rewarding and definitely worth reading.
0441013597|3.0|I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. The premise was very creative. There were some good messages about preparing for the future, and refraining before showing anger.
B001UV4XIS|2.0|I am tempted to use profanity in describing my reaction to this movie. Instead, I'll say this; if you tried to film a more mediocre movie out of an excellent seventh and finishing novel, you couldn't. The characters, and their tragedies and redemptions, are sacrificed to the glory of special effects and more frenzied action. The credits list Ms. Rowling herself as a producer to which I say HUH??!! Did she see the completed product? There were so many great character moments in the novel and almost none make there ways onto the screen. And the ending is a botch. The only glorious exception to this rule is the all too brief moments with Severus Snape, played with the wonderful Alan Rickman. In his death scene and the viewing of his memories by Harry, the emotional impact of the book comes through. Fred's death, ten seconds of screen time, if that. Virtually no explantion of Dumbledore and his past, no real explanation of the Hallows themselves (so why have the name in the title?) It feels like all involved were overwhelmed by trying to finish and just tried to rush it through. The book, and the wonderful actors, deserved better. Sorry, this may have been a cash cow but it doesn't belong in the pantheon of greatness. Mediocre, extremely.

B005WM6RUS|5.0|Paris is the city of love and lights and on the fateful day of July 16, 1942, it became a city of unspeakable horrors.  On July 16th, 1942, Jewish families were forcibly removed from their home by the French police.  The police came for Sarah's family in the middle of the night and Sarah made a decision that would affect generations. She locked her little brother in a cupboard in their bedroom and promised to release him when she got home.  The Jewish families were brought to the Velerdrome d'Hiver, to await transportation to a nearby camp and then many continued to Auschwitz. Sarah was not going home.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2002, the 60th commemeration of the Jewish roundup.  Julia is assigned to write a news article about the roundup that most French people would rather forget.  As Julia begins investigating the past, she discovers a story that will change her life.  Sarah's story.<br /><br />In this amazing duel storyline, every other chapter switches narrators from Sarah to Julia.  Half way through the book Sarah's narration ends as Julia tries to solve the mystery of what happened to Sarah.  Julia becomes consumed by Sarah's story and unraveling her husband's family secrets.<br /><br />Sarah's Key is a compelling historical drama that had me riveted from the first page.  I was also consumed by Sarah's story and was hopeful for a positive outcome.  The personal tragedies that people suffer and overcome are a testament to the resilience of humanity.  Sarah's Key is haunting, compelling, emotional and mesmerizing.  I couldn't tear my eyes or my heart away from this remarkable novel.  Make sure you have a handful of tissues for the ending.

0553582445|5.0|Robin Hobb's Farseer & Tawny Man trilogies are among my coming-of-age fantasy favorites along with Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicle and Peter V. Brett's Demon Cycle. Ms. Hobb writes exceptionally well, frequently evoking deep emotions. Her strong first-person narrative, endearing characters, engaging story and exciting magic (the \\"Wit\\" & the \\"Skill\\" instead of sorcery) made my reading experience feel real. It isn't perfect as there is a bit of padding and repetition, (understandably) not much action, \\"assassin\\" in the titles may not necessarily match reader expectations, and the pace may feel somewhat slow.  The Farseer Trilogy (Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin & Assassin's Quest): Presents a simple yet inspiring story of an abandoned boy, an illegitimate heir talented in both Wit (abhorred beast magic) and Skill (magic to send thoughts, usually found only in those of royal blood), loyal to his king in the time of the Red Ship War. It is at mid-series when Fitz bonds with an unlikely creature that the Wit magic begins to shine. Readers not continuing onto The Tawny Man may be left disappointed since the ending is closed in only a few pages appearing rushed (as it is structured with a sequel in mind) and depressed from Fitz's losses (better appreciated in the sequel).  The Tawny Man Trilogy (Fool's Errand, Golden Fool & Fool's Fate): Direct sequel to The Farseer Trilogy. Here lies the true ending to Fitz's tale, explains his connection to the Fool, retells post-war events, and expands beyond the Six Duchies kingdom. After fifteen years, Fitz returns as a lowly servant to rescue his lost prince and then slay a dragon. Very moving are his journey with his Wit companion, his reunion with his surrogate mother, and most especially his coded message for his guardian (the stablemaster) in a Skill dream.  I couldn't resist reading this series non-stop and I am fortunate to find it in a time when all six books have already been published. Overall, it's quite enjoyable, very rewarding and definitely worth reading.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've had a similar sharpening tool from Gerber, which was decent, but never really impressed me. It always required some extra honing with a good stone and/or stropping. I ended up giving it to a friend, who gave it to another friend, who eventually gave it to my dad, who unknowingly tried to give it back to me. So, I've since been skeptical of such sharpening tools, and have been sharpening all my blades with stones or ceramic rod. I don't mind \\"kickin' it old school,\\" since I get great results, but it seemed like a little too much effort for my cheaper knock-around knives (which I use a lot more than my nicer blades).<br /><br />I was recently surprised by how well the [[ASIN:B00032S02K Smith Abrasives CCKS 2-Step Knife Sharpener]] worked, so I went and bought the Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener for my serrated knives.  Now, I regret not getting both of these sharpeners sooner, as they both do a really decent job with most of my knives, in very little time, and with minimal sweat.<br /><br />I use this for all of my knives, and for the nicer blades I'll finish it off with the stones. But this is a great time saver. The design is simple, but effective, and as long as I clean it with a little dish soap, it just keeps working. I recommend either of the Smith Abrasives tools as a sharpener for casual usage... But even a perfectionist could use it to start with, and finish the edge off the way they like, with more precise tools.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I really like this case.  It fits the Kindle Fire very well and feels great.  It is very low profile and light weight.  The negative reviews concerning the stand feature are unfounded.  In the explanatory video it says, \\"The stand must be used on a LEVEL surface.\\"  The felt lining is a bit of a lint magnet but that's typical of any type of fabric.  I would highly recommend this product to other Kindle Fire users.

0307720748|4.0|A exhilarating autobiography that could be read as a thriller, adventure, aspirant, romance or entrepreneurial.  The noblest thing that I noted was Richard Branson gave most of the credit of his chequered business career to those who worked with him. That in itself explain of why he is so successful.  In this book, we followed Richard Branson from his days as a school boy, to his first sex, onto his first success in Student and Tubular Bells, on his various daring and suicidal adventure, and finally to him as the current business maverick we come to know.  I have extracted some adage and touching moments:  1. I have never gone into any business purely to make money. If that is the sole motive then I believe you are better off not doing it. A business has to be involving; it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative instincts.  2. \\"What's money for, anyway? It's to make things happen. And I'm sure you'll make things happen with this recording studio just as you won that ten shillings off me when you learnt to swim,\\" said Branson's Auntie Joyce to Branson when she remortgaged her house to help Branson with the purchase of the Manor.  3. My parents have always drummed into me that all you have in life is your reputation: you may be very rich, but if you lose your good name you'll never be happy. The thought will always lurk at the back of your mind that people don't trust you. - When Branson was placed in prison.  4. We always asked the local teenagers where the best place for a record shop would be. - On setting up the Virgin Record stalls.  5. I knew that it is only being bold that you get anywhere. - When Branson decided not to license Virgin's records to leverage on easy money but to go for a manufacturing and distribution deal even when he did not have the capital.  6. The only assets a record company has are its copyrights. - Branson's foresight when signing contracts with artist.  7. Right from the start Simon and I tried to position Virgin as an international company, and the second thing that we always insisted on was incorporating worldwide copyright to the artist's work in our contracts. - Branson with big ambition.  8. In music as in many other things the second choice means nothing.

B000002H97|5.0|The Black Album. The collision course of the world of Metal, with the world of Mainstream. Not only is this the band's bestselling Album ever, but in the world of Metal it's only Beaten by Led Zeppelin IV and Back in Black, and Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid theory\\" amazingly enough. Within the selection of Thrash Metal, it's number 1, and no one else even comes close.   And speaking of Thrash, this album creates what I like to call \\"Commercial Thrash.\\" Other examples might be, Youthenasia by Megadeth.  Fact. This is not a pure Thrash Album. But even that does not take away the other fact, that this is the Metallica Masterpiece. However, is this a great Album? Yes. Is this there best album? Not Really...   For what it's worth, the Black Album gets flack by some fans because of Metallica's Change in direction, but despite this one criticism there is much good to say about this album. First off, if you are a close listener, you know that James Hetfield's voice is at its peak in this period. This album not only propelled Metallica to the top, but it propelled Metal and because of that, the world of Metal has never been the same and bands that exist today, only do so because of the Black album and its effect.   This album also introduces Bob Rock to the party, which with one point in his corner, further pushed Metallica to the top of the charts, but also pushed their metal in a different direction as what will be seen in the upcoming Load Albums. Bob Rock is not a bad producer, at least at this time in his career, perhaps he's bad in the Era of St. Anger, but I'll leave that for another review. However, it's near impossible to fault the production of the Black Album. It's time now to get into the songs.   *Enter Sandman*  There is something about this song that is not found in any other song in the entire Metallica Library. I don't know why, but it's catchy and all you wanna do is listen to it. Is it my favorite? No, Is it the best? No. But the way this song flows, it's no wonder that this is one the most successful singles in the whole realm of metal. It's awesomeness is indescribable.   *Sad But True*  This song is not one of my favorites. IT's borderline with the ones I really like, and the ones I just like. There are some days I really enjoy it, and other days not so much. Some fans don't understand the difference between Heavy, and Thrash. Heavy, yes this song is heavy, Thrash? No, not at all. However, it's a strong song with a steady drum beat and a great song for sure.  *Holier Than thou*  One of the faster songs on the album. It's probably the closest thing to Thrash in the entire album. But as said, it's one of my favorites on the album, I enjoy the drum beat here and on top of that, the bass absent from the previous album is now very clear as there are several examples of Jason shredding it on the Bass, and Great solos from Kirk to boot. Great song.   *Unforgiven*  While the previous three songs on the album had been a bit different, they were still heavy. This is the song that truly told fans you were hearing something different. Each Metallica Album from \\"Lightning\\" to \\"Justice\\" had a song that starts slow tempo and builds up to metal massacre at the end. This song however doesn't do that. It hovers between Mid Tempo to slow Tempo and never builds into that mega ending. But it don't need to. There is something epic about this song, and on top of that, it's still heavy anyway. This song is where you see the A+ production being shown off. Yes, one of my all-time favorites.   *Where Ever I May Roam*  This song is the perfect live song. It's slower, just like the rest of the album, but it's probably one of the most heavy on the entire album and even one of the heaviest all of Metallica's songs. This is one of the places where Lars drumming really comes into play, it sticks out in a good way. It's just epic, purely epic. Additionally, this song is notable for the usage of a 12 string bass, something that Jason Newsted never did live...  *Don't Tread on Me*  In keeping with the slower pace, and to counter much of the perceived anti-american nature that was supposedly seen in the previous albums. This song was more along the lines of showing that America was a truly a good place to live. And yet... James Hetfield don't like the song. LOL. It's heavy and the straight up Tempo that we've seen for the last few songs of the album. Good solos, interesting choice. Not my choice song, but not bad either.   *Through the Never*  An underrated song, like most of Metallica's albums, there are so many good songs, that there winds up being a good song or two that tends to be forgetten about in comparison to the rest. This is one of those songs, and one of the ones that have been growing on me again lately. Ever since I got the box set, I've been enjoying this song again and again.  *Nothing Else Matters*  One of the oldest rules in the world of music is if you take the most successful song off of a previous album, then you'll see the next album reflect that. We see this with Metallica as well. \\"Master of Puppets\\" was a complex machine, which lead to \\"Justice\\" album. \\"One\\" had a lot of slower tempos we find on the album here. And this song, which is not only one of my favorites, but my very first favorite Metallica song, is the origin of the Load Album in my opinion. Load is at times more a Hard Rock album then a Metal one, and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" despite being one of Metallica's best songs, is not really a Metal song but a Hard Rock Ballad. But all that aside, it's one of the best ballads of all time, and a great song. IT's now considered by Metallica, a tribute to the fans, and as I fan, that means something to me considering how great this song is.   *Of Wolf and Man*  I find that this song in some ways seems to harken back to \\"Thing that should not be.\\" While the songs are different, stylistically they are similar, even their origin seems to be similar. IT's a good song that clearly has some horror movie history behind it, not unlike some other Metallica songs. It's not a bad song, but not one of my favorites on the album. There is one plus, you can really hear the bass in this song, and that's always good for Metallica.   *The God That Failed*  I find this song, while not my top choice on the album, one of the ones I really like listening to. It's got classic riffs, and it's very interesting. It has some relation to a future song in Metallica's library, \\"Until it sleeps\\" which dealt with the death of James' father, and his feelings about the religion of his parents. It's a very powerful song, and could be anthem for people who feel betrayed by religion.   *My Friend of Misery*  This is an old song for me on the album. Yes, I like this song, and I like hearing it. But I find it out of place on the album. It disrupts the flow of my listen through of this Album. However, as said, it's a good song. Jason wanted this to be an instrumental, and I've wondered about having the instrumental as opposed to what we have now. But this is a good song, it just doesn't work for me on a playlist. However, this song does grow on you, so I'll probably like it more in the future.   *The Struggle Within*  This song doesn't reach me as well as some of the others. Once again, not a bad song. Most Metallica songs are good with a few rare examples otherwise. The solos are good, and the song is well done. But I feel that it's songs like these more than any other that make certain crowds long for master of puppets.   Finally: The last 3 songs on the album come off as less interesting, while not bad, they grab me like other songs have in the past. I will state for the record, that they should have pulled a Dyers Eve on us for the Black Album. Much of the album before it \\"Justice\\" was slower than the rest, but Dyers Eve was their fastest song. I think if they had even one song of a Whiplash Speed, this would be a different album.   The Album is worth 5 stars despite not being quite as interesting as MoP or Lightning, there is really nothing wrong with the album, it's just there are times when I wish it could have been more. Still a worth by, and one of the best heavy metal albums of all time.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|I've had this about two months now and I've used it about 3 hours. It's everything they claim it to be, except that, games still haven't been given profiles for use with it. While it is just easier to make your own profile for whatever game you intend to use it with, it would be nice if Logitech would update their profiles to include newer titles. This will work under the latest SWTOR released MMO, but you must make your own profile for that game for it to work. It does not have that much of an incline to the device; it lays kind of flat; and the ergonomics of it aren't as curvy as you'd expect. I have a medium sized hand and mid range sized fingers, and it fits my hand perfectly. If you've got long fingers or large hands, don't bother with this gameboard because you'll have serious issues with cramping and god knows what else. Small hands may have some issues as well; not being able to reach keys. The thumb POV works like a charm and isn't \\"unusual\\" to your hand position, and is not rigid (moves well, but not too loose). You can also program this thing for video applications and graphics programs, so if you're wanting something quicker than a keyboard for that, this works well.

It was so entertaining I could hardly put it down.

B003R0MF5S|5.0|Chuck is my absolute favorite show of all time!!! That said, I remember feeling somewhat mixed about a few of the episodes when they first aired. Going back now though, I realize just how seriously absurd this storyline twists itself, but the second time around I'm completely in love with it!! Bottom line, if you're already a Chuck fan you already own this, so my recommendation is pretty redundant. If you're still scoping out the show, well...you're at the wrong page, go find season one and work your way up. One of the most rewarding shows I've ever watched though, and it's by an amazing miracle (and terrible luck on NBC behalf) we have a final season. Biggest victory in tv history.

B005FITIGO|4.0|Seriously, would you trust these people with your life savings?<br /><br />Margin Call emphasizes the fact that we don't have as much control over our own investment decisions as we would like to think. There are those of us who have to follow the rules and then there are those who abuse the system, pushing it to and over the brink of disaster. It isn't possible to look at investing quite the same after watching it from the inside. The rules are for the little guys. The big guys will make money one way or another. I certainly would not have wanted to be on the other side of that final phone call.<br /><br />It made me want to go bury my savings in a coffee can in the back yard.<br /><br />Actors are excellent. There was more than the average amount of profanity. Good scenery in the few instances where they stepped out of the office for a few minutes.<br /><br />It was a depressing reminder of how things are and why we can never again really trust a system that is this badly out of control.
0547258305|4.0|I don't normally like YA. I want to, but so often the characters and situations fall short. But this was very strong. Not flawless, but the characters worked and so I didn't want to stop. If you find yourself avoiding YA because of the tiredness in the genre, you might still love this. I did!  Why only four stars?  The romance moved too quickly in one part, namely the forest stuff. Also I didn't like how the Graces, which started out being fairly concrete (good at fighting, good at killing, good at swimming, good at cooking) turned into these loose concepts (good at predicting weather, good at sensing things, good at mind reading, good at manipulating minds). The concept of a Grace wasn't as strong at that point.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|Lots of action, patriotism, great scenery, and you have to pay attention, because there are surprises. Good vs. evil. Nothing much to offend anyone. The special effects are amazing. I loved the actors, all the way from the main stars to the extras. It was fun to watch. The ending was...not what I expected.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Love the different colors.  I went with white, but others got the Pink too.  Colored side doesn't mar and the felt lined cover keeps the glass clean as well.  Propping up is kinda hokey, but works once you figure it out.  I love the elastic band to hold the flap shut.  2 months running now and it hasn't stretched out, so probably will go the distance.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A great way to read and hear Gods word  works great on our Fire.  To bad it has to be on line   but great around the house and if the place you have a bible study has wifi  Lots of other things in this app to use also
0061122416|5.0|This is an amazing book, one I give for Birthdays, Holidays, or just to cheer someone up. Everyone feels lost at a point in time and this book makes you feel like your right where your supposed to be. A fast read with a positive message.
B000QFCD5O|2.0|Straight up, this is a rather dull sounding and boring cd/dvd. Steve Howe's guitar (as good as he is) just simply sounds boring and has no life whatsoever. Bass sounds good and all, drums are good, vocals, so so, but over all this is just a one time listen if you're a fan and put it away forever. Disappointed. If they had some life and punch to their live sound, they'd be pretty awesome. But it's just not here at all. Only 2 stars because I will never have a desire to listen to or watch this again, although it was cool to see them on dvd. Highlight of the concert is Carl's drums in the middle of here comes the feeling.
B0069UP2PI|1.0|This movie was a huge let down, if it were not for the famous actors, this movie would not have been worth watching.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's not an easy game to play because there's a lot of strategy to it. but this game is very addicting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good entertaining fun. helps past hours fast and good variety of games. I would have more games added to these
B006W0QOF2|5.0|this movie is about showing love for your fellow man,not to mention the acting was outstanding i alwys like ryans syle
1416905014|5.0|My granddaughter is expecting her first child in February and asked all of us to buy the baby a book and pen a note to the baby.  Since we know it's a girl and this is a special pregnancy I wanted to get something unique and different.  This book was it!  My granddaugher and her husband loved it as did the rest of the folks at her shower.  Thank you for having the perfect book to give this child.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great fun for free.  Cant get much better than that.  I like that I_ have the over all goal to unlock everything so it doesn't seem like I'm just randomly playing games.
B004FOA84A|5.0|One of the best games(puzzle) I've ever played.  It had me going and thinking the whole time.  It has great graphics and sounds. I highly recommend this game to those who like to think and be challenged. I felt like Sherlock Holmes when I was playing.  I wish there were more games like this!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game Is fun and challenging. I like that the games aren't really easy and that to get points we can download other games.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|First of all I want to say that this sounds amazing. The difference between having this amp hooked up and just listening through headphones is night and day. I have an ipod and the sound quality is far from being the best of all the MP3 players out there. This amp makes any song sound like it was imported with lossless audio. The bass is amazing, making great use of my Beats Sudio Heaphones. The only downside, which is pretty big, is you pretty much can't be moving while it's hooked up. It will constantly go in and out, usually only hearing the music from one ear. I do have to mention that I am using the ipod hookup and not using the headphone jack part of it. Overall I was impressed, though. Worth the money.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|this movie has officially destroyed the star trek frenchise this does not even feel like a real star trek film its more focused on action not story this movie is poorly written and i know who wrote this movie alex kurtzman and robert orci and j j abrams directed it and produced this is the worst star trek movie ever made it has offcially destroyed the orginial star trek this movie is a big pile of you know what this movie i give is two thumbs way down even tho i love the orginial mlovie series and the orginial series itself this movie destroys the orginial frenchise soo much its beyond repair and it can not be repaired or retooled

B0054JZC6E|4.0|It'a good time waster! most of the games are rather mindless with one or two that make you think. I enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Got this app a few weeks ago. So far it is a good time water for those empty minutes during the day. The ads are alright. When I first downloaded this app I did have the issue with that movie trailer but haven't after day 1. It hasn't hijacked my fire like others said it did. I would re commend.
1601251505|5.0|The Pathfinder Roleplaying game from Paizo is a great Dungeons and Dragons type fantasy game that brings action, skills, feats, magic, roleplaying and monsters to the forefront. Pathfinder has helped to bring back the popularity of tabletop RPG gaming. The game has a great system which builds upon the 3.5 rules and adds more flavor to the whole package. Paizo Pathfinder books are generous in content and packed with great artwork, and tons of ideas. Those people that like Dungeons and Dragons type games but are not happy with new editions such as 4th edition should be pleased with Pathfinder. Pathfinder has great modules, sourcebooks, and Beastiary's to expand your game to a huge massive world. Some may want to take a more basic route with the Pathfinder box set, but the problem with those is you don't get the full game included. This Core Rulebook provides all the rules, classes, races, tons of spells, equipment, and everything else you need to play (but I also highly recommend getting the Pathfinder GM Guide along with it to teach people the full proper game idea). I could go on for hours but I just wanted to let you gamers out there know Paizo hit a homerun with Pathfinder. The game has filled the gap for people into tabletop Roleplaying games for now. Highly Recommended!
0753801728|5.0|Any published work that causes the reader to connect the context of the book to their own situation and/or experiences, deserves notice.    The Reader will be relevant to the next generation of students as it was to the protagonist, Michael.  Perhaps even more relevant to new readers who discover this book by way of the movie as I did.   The book is worth passing along to those whom you respect, admire and care for.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there is a great selection of games. many options. had no idea you have to win points for mew takes. great concept though.
0525478817|5.0|John Green is my favorite author, by a long shot. When I heard about TFiOS, the plot didn't really interest me, but I was afraid I would say I loved it just because I loved John and I didn't want that because I respect him too much. As the release date got closer, I became exceedingly excited about this book. I had preordered from Amazon, but I wasn't going to receive it until 3 days after, which happened to be today. But on the 10th, I realized I would not be able to wait 3 days to read it, so I drove to WalMart and bought another copy. I read it instead of studying for finals, which probably wasn't the best idea, but I regret nothing. That being said, I will admit TFiOS did not live up to Looking For Alaska, but it's probably tied for second with Paper Towns. This book is about teenagers with cancer that met at a support group in the \\"literal heart of Jesus.\\" That's all I'm going to say about the plot so I won't spoil it for anyone, but I will say it made me laugh out loud and cry real tears. After I finished it, I went to bed with the book, hugging it. That may sound weird but.. whatever. Read this book. You won't regret it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|love it. im hooked on this game my boyfriend had it and i love it but it needs to be in the android market dangit... LOL
B000JMLDCS|2.0|The author is very long winded and hard to follow. I would suggest a different book if you do not want to have to wade through all the idle chatter.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Originally we watched this movie from Netflix.  We enjoyed it so much that we decided to purchase it.  This miniseries has a very good plot and dialogue.  The all-star cast makes the miniseries even more enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is really fun. its easy to play once you get the hang of it. points are easy to accumulate, and no actual money is involved..
0525478817|5.0|I am a big fan of John Green and definitely was not disappointed by this book. It was definitely his best so far. It was funny and smart and sad all at the same time. A beautiful book and definitely a must read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if your gonna cry about controls and updates dont play the game.  its a FREE GAME.  only paid games should get bad reviews. if they are not worth paying for
0525478817|5.0|I pretty much loved everything about this book. And I'm not going to lie to you and say it's all sunshine and roses and daffodils, but you could probably guess that much. I've always been a huge fan of John Green and was overly excited when I received the book in the mail. I couldn't put the book down and finished it in about 4 hours. It's been about 3 days since I finished the book and it's something that I can't stop thinking about. I just keep going over the details in my mind. The book is an excellent one and I highly recommend it to everyone. DFTBA.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Quell. keeps. you. on your. toes.  I love. it. I like. the music,  its very. calming. as you. play. I would. recommend. this game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good game to kill a little bit of time. ok graphics and stuff. could always be better in some way
1847879071|5.0|I am usually loathed to spend to spend my hard earned cash on text books for uni but this is one I have got so much value from already, and know I will continue to do so.  The only book I have ever come across that can have me in stitches whilst revising for an exam and Field has a great style of writing which keeps me engaged even through the laboriously technical equations.  Covers everything you need to know as a first introduction to statistics AND SPSS, both explained in detail and comprehensively takes you through each step.  Thank you Andy!
B000OVLBIU|5.0|The film adaptation of another Stan Lee Marvel comic of the same name. Fans of Marvel comics will find this very entertaining and true to it's original story
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater 2x..have watched the DVD at least 4x already... Hate woody Allen however love love love the premis of this movie and the background of the movie.unfortunately one has to have literary background to understand who many of the people are.
B001P829VY|5.0|A classic story of man giving into greed and the consequences of human weakness. Extremely well done film could take place today. It shows the folly of men in elemental fashion
B004UBM4TA|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this at a Dome IMAX and it was one of the most sensational experiences I've ever had. Naturally when I saw it at Best Buy I grabbed it no question. Got it for $35. Could of been $60 wouldnt of made any difference to me. It's half the length of an ordinary film but worth every penny. Flying through space at 150 trillion miles per second in an accurately scaled universe with stunning vfx design. Hanging out in space with the astronauts watching them float around above the earth still makes my legs a bit queasy. This is an excellent production and if you have a 3D TV (hopefully a big one), this is the most necessary addition to your collection I coud think of. Excellent for a viewing with a significant other as well. You will not walk away from this picture without being touched and moved by how extraordinary space is and the bravery of the astronauts who dare to go there. Just get it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I started the plan that will let me read the Bible in a year.  Using this app on my Kindle Fire has been GREAT - with a simple click of the audio button, I can read along while listening to my Kindle.  The option to just listen, combined with the fact that the app automatically switches from one passage to another (so I don't have to manually move from old testament to new) makes it the best Bible app I've found!  If you're like me, someone who's tried to read through the Bible but failed in the past, give this app a try!
B006L4MX0Y|5.0|If you have read and enjoyed The Hunger Games books then you have to watch this film. It follows a group of kids selected to enter a battle to the death tournament in which the last survivor wins (sound familiar). I first saw this film many years ago when I was turned onto it by a cult film website. It has been a popular anime series and spawned 3 movies. This will be the first US release of the film however it has been available through non-region coded DVD but you had to search it out. I heard somewhere that this movie was never distributed in the US because the subject matter was not something a US audience would accept.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|As a 4th grade teacher, I love this app!  I've been using it with my students during our study of the solar system. Well done!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This book is really fun and interesting despite it covering a depressing and sometimes confusing subject. The author does a great job balancing detail about the financial instruments with metaphors to help laymen understand whats happening.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I too really love this film (and was prompted by it to hunt down and watch all of Refn's other movies, which are also very much worth watching). I searched through the reviews here, and while I did see one reference to the work of Michael Mann, I did not find any to Jean Pierre Melville's [[ASIN:B000AQKUG8 Le Samourai (The Criterion Collection)]]. If you liked Drive, and have never seen (or perhaps even heard of) this earlier film that Drive references VERY strongly, then I recommend you see it as soon as possible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game(s) are the best thing ever. so many varieties of games. no one can bet that. OMG! so asome!
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun especially when you have nothing else to do. I like the option to.pick a winning or random deal. lu
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game allows you the chance to win most of the time. it does not deal out unwinable hands more often than not like a lot of other solitaire games ive seen
B004ZJZQH4|2.0|I am giving two stars for this edition, not the film itself, which is excellent.  The video quality on the Blu-Ray was a major disappointment.  There is a lot of noise or grain throughout, and is a big distraction.  After watching the Sapphire edition of Braveheart, which was also released in 1995 and looks stunning on Blu-Ray, Apollo 13 desperately needs to be remastered.  This would still be a decent buy if you don't already have it in your DVD collection, but it does not live up to Blu-Ray quality.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Sux. Games are all the same. Crappy. Should have made 25 games good instead of 101 crappy ones. Just my opinion though. Different strokes.
B0000033J9|5.0|I found this soundtrack to be what I had hoped for--relaxing and enjoyable.  I listened initially at my computer (with earphones) at work and the soundtrack helped me work with a lighter heart and greater enthusiasm.  It recalled for me the wonderful scenes in the movie, which happens to be one of my all time favorite romantic movies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good stuff I like it lots of games passes time good stuff I like it lots of games passes time
0307460444|4.0|The honeymoon period for cookbooks usually wanes a few recipes in. Then it sits, looking impressive on a shelf of cookbooks that don't entice the taste buds as much as the eyes. This book is a feast for the eyes and a joy for your mouth; with photos accompanying instructions that don't intimidate; creative decorations for all levels; and most importantly, cupcakes of such tantalizing yumminess even a novice baker (like myself) will fancy themselves an up and coming baker extraordinaire, eagerly awaiting the next cupcake baking opportunity.  There are a few issues with this book that cannot be ignored and stole a star from what would otherwise be a five star cookbook. There is at least one BIG recipe mistake--the rum caramel glaze called for 1/4 cup water which caused huge problems, 4 failed attempts and the desire to throw in the towel:  it needs to be 1/2 cup water. I am a little worried that there could be other unrecoverable errors but the last two cupcakes I made had no errors and were amazing--red velvet and Boston cream with chocolate ganache. my other complaint is the cheap binding. With how much I anticipate using this book I worry it won't hold up.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|We received our MicroShell promptly, & immediately tried it on our Kindle Fire. Perfect fit, & light weight to go with the Kindle. We haven't tried the fold feature as yet, but believe it will work well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Love all of the different games available - it keeps me interested! A great app for all ages and people.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I am relatively new to the The Black Keys, but I was pretty impressed with \\"Brothers\\" and am even more so with \\"El Camino\\". I like the souped-up production by Danger Mouse (what a name!) and I find El Camino to be a little more cohisive style-wise than Brothers - which jumped around a bit. Standout tracks include - \\"Dead and Gone\\", \\"Little Black Submarines\\", \\"Nova Baby\\" and my absolute favorite \\"Sister\\". For those who are inclined to say that there is not much good new music anymore, you should absolutely check out The Back Keys - a very unique style/sound and obviously very talanted musicians and songwriters!
B005V4X8JA|5.0|Being a long-time fan of Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and especially of their first album together, I bought this CD. It is a fine remastering. Just to compare, I went to my local library and borrowed the CD. My library has the Atlantic remaster of 1994 (Atlantic 82651). That is a fine remaster, too. I put both CD's in my player. The Audio Fidelity remaster sounds fine. But so does the 1994 Atlantic remaster. The difference is not that great. I think the strings in the Audio Fidelity remaster sound a bit richer and overall the album sounds, shall I say, brighter, more strident, if you will. And as I've noticed in a lot of remasters, the bass is amped up. But not the volume, thankfully. Many remasters are way louder, perhaps because of an improved signal-to-noise ratio.   I'm not disappointed in the Audio Fidelity effort, but you can probably find the Atlantic remaster of 1994 at half the price of the AF, and the difference is almost indistinguishable.
0439023513|1.0|The first two books of this trilogy were definitely page turners.  I don't think Collins knew what do do to wrap up this horrific allegory.  Her writing was sloppy, there was an overabundance of gratuitous violence, and ultimately, her trilogy was cold and unsatisfying.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|terrible, I dont mind unlocking games but every 5 plays or so an annoying aberrant comes up, ruins the experience for me altogether. I don't expect to be flooded with advertisements every time i'm play a game, they're obnoxious to say the least.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow! This book is amazing, breathtaking and just beautifully written! This is John Green's best book yet! I think this is the best book ever and it is certainly the best book I've ever read and I've read over 200 books! This is a great book and a 100% recommend this to any customer. I assure you; John Green is the BEST AUTHOR EVER!
B002I0J5FG|3.0|I played ICO on PS2, but never Colossus. I primarily bought this to play Colossus, but will get to ICO at some point.   The game, Shadow of the Colossus, is a lot of fun. I didn't find myself exploring and wandering around because frankly it's not as unique of an experience as it used to be since there are so many games that you can do that in these days. The graphics were not as polished as I was expecting, and I dealt with a fair amount of popup and weird graphical things. None of which totally took away from the overall experience too much.  The controls feel a bit clunky, especially on the horse.  But the game is still great fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|We have been having fun with these short games! It is addictive too! We even got hubby to install and play.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I bought this DVD on a trip to the US mainland. I thought I was buying the original series and I was disappointed when I found I had bought the wrong one. I thought I would watch an episode or two but I ended up watching the entire series at once. It was just that good. I decided to watch the first episode again and I found that I had missed some of the intricate points at first pass. Watching this series a second time was just as good as watching it the first time. The writers wove an intricate plot with all sorts of cues and information that can be missed.  I wish the producers would make a prequel to this prequel, there is such a wealth of good storytelling that it could be done.  My favorite character in this series was Gaia. She has a lot in common with her good friend Lucretia and they seem to have a wonderful backstory. One of the center themes in this series was to explain a number of characters in context. Crixus as a new recruit was excellent. The crusty pater familius was excellent. The deep friendship of solonius and the falling out is great story telling.   I liked this series so much, I handed several copies as gifts. Excellent DVD!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is awesome! I got it on the kindle fire and it works fine. everyone says its bad. its really good and the adds really don't matter so the 99 cent one is a rip off. get this game! its awesome!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for passing time, and lots of fun because you can save up for more and more games. I love those types of games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app has games for the whole family. read instructions before each mini game. love it. great for long travel too
B000003TSP|5.0|I've been listening to both albums (Dummy and P-P) for a while.  Comparatively, Dummy has commercial aspirations whereas P-P wants to drag you into some corner of the back room and wrap you in a straight-jacket.  Claustrophobic, obsessive, introspective and haunting by turns, P-P on All Mine says it best:  \\"...make no mistake, you shan't escape, tethered in time there's no where to hide from me.\\"  P-P takes an evolutionary step away from Dummy's playfulness (to the extent it exists) to a stripped-to-the-emotional-bones approach, all led by Beth Gibbons' etherial / wavering / processed vocals.  \\"How can I forget you?\\"  Apparently, I can't.  Among the notable tracks is Elysium -- the one, ironically, most derivative of Dummy, but no less evil-mystery-movie than the rest of this CD...that suddenly changes course half way through into a plaintive, wordless piano ballad (implying you might be able to leave), only to be trapped once again...\\"You can't deny how I feel.\\"  After listening to P-P, there's no doubt any longer.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|You can play some neat games.  but this has in app purchases so keep the kids away.  Too many freemium games are out there and not honest.
0316044695|4.0|First I'll say that the story of Marcus Luttrell, his journey to become a SEAL and his wartime experiences was phenomenal.  Thank God our Country still produces people that are willing to give of themselves for the rest of us.  These guys make horrible money (I know I was enlisted for 8 years) and are constantly under scrutiny by the press to fight a 'nice war'.  That makes what they endure even more notable.  I gave it 4 stars because his youthful writing is evident.  Had he waited until he was in his 40s to write this it might have flowed a little smoother.  There are many paragraphs were he jumps into a personal disertation that he already used earlier in a chapter.    Finally if you left-leaning in your politics, you'll be outright offended by some of his comments.  For me personally I could care less. I endorse at least 90% of what he says about the left and how they endanger the lives of our soldiers. That being said I can see how someone who doesn't agree with him might not even finish the book.  All in all a great read and I would highly recommend it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I'd recommend watching the video before buying it so you know what you're getting, anyways i got the white case and it is great! it's lightweight like it says and is very durable, great product overall.
0525478817|5.0|This book is amazing. I could not put it down. I definitely  recommend this book to anyone who loves to read. Such a beautiful story that only John Green could write so heart touchingly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome if is a lot of fun just did this for the money the game sucks jk. lol. hi ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a pretty good game, but some things are really hard to beat. the games could be designed better and it could have a better overallsetup.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|The CD was received in a very timely manner in mint condition - the only thing that would have made the purchase better would be if Ms. Amy was still with us!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Free and basic all you need game. Has everything you want in this classic. A must have for the kindle fire.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|I purchased this album after watching the Enemy of God video on Youtube. Truth be told, I had never heard of Kreator until that day. The CD came in perfect condition and I immediately started browsing to expand my Kreator collection. Enemy of God and Voices of the Dead are still my favorite tracks off the album, but I love every song on this album and it's rare to find a cd you can listen to track after track without skipping any.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very good and you don't HAVE to throw money at it to complete it. I give it 5 stars.
B000TXG3YA|1.0|I purchased this CD awhile ago and am now getting back to reviewing many purchases. For some reason it goes from track 1 to 99 like it's burnt onto a blank media. The track list is from 1 to 13 and I have no clue where or when a song break is... Great music and Band but the CD was a pain in the ass to listen to...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game isbpretty good. kinds bugs me that you have to unlock all of the games with the coins but you gain coins pretty easily.
B005COO1X6|2.0|The book started off fine but then I realized that this book was just a advertisemet. it essentially had no ending and there were no real surprises. I hope Stephen did not spend too much time on this.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This app is great for downloading videos that can be watched without wi-fi and for downloading your own copy of Music, but It stops unexpectedly on my Kindle Fire. I have Good Wi-fi, I wish this problem could be fixed!!!
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire was AMAZING!!! It was great, but it didn't get SUPER exciting as much as The Hunger Games and Mockingjay. I personally liked it a LOT. It was AMAZING. My favorite parts were probably the second and third parts of the book. Especially the last chapter. Mainly the last sentence. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!! \\"But Gale is not one to keep secrets from me. \\"Katniss, there is no District 12.\\"\\" Total cliffhanger ending. I don't know how I survived those 3 1/2 weeks before Christmas (I got the whole trilogy for Christmas). It was just kind of slow until the announcement about the Quarter Quell (all of us who have read the book know about that.).<br /><br />Anyway, it was a great book and if you enjoyed the first book in the trilogy, you will enjoy this one too. And, besides, if you want to finish the full trilogy, you'll have to read this before Mockinjay.

B0013527I4|5.0|I am a longtime Muppets fan, and season three is when the show really hit its stride. If showstopping musical numbers, humor equal parts pun-derful and absurd, and an affectionate ribbing of show business are your things, you can't miss The Muppet Show Season Three. Episode highlights for me included the gorgeous voice of Pearl Bailey, the hilarious Gilda Radner, the surprisingly game Alice Cooper, and Roy Rogers with Dale Evans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Having God's Word in my hands with all.my notes is priceless! The quick search for scripture is very handy, especially when I'm in a pinch. the Bible reading plans have increased my time in the Word &amp; increased my hunger for more. I really like the ability to stay on track, catch myself up.if I get behind &amp; switch between versions for the verses of the day. This creates a quick &amp; thorough study ot God's Word.  I also like the ability to listen to scripture while I'm getting ready for the day, relaxing or driving. The dramatized versions are the best!

B0067QPVJ6|2.0|\\"It ain't a damn joke man, the freaking thing's alive.\\"  A group of scientists in Antartica have discovered something.  When grad student Kate Lloyd (Winstead) is sent to see what they have found she and lead scientist Halvorson begin to butt heads.  While the fighting occurs something awakens the discovery.  I have never seen the original or the 80's remake so I wasn't sure what to expect from this.  What I found was that this was a very un-original and pretty boring movie.  I do watch a ton of movies every week and have noticed that there are about 4 ideas that keep getting re-done and this is part of the problem. The plot of this one is...group finds something...new group shows up...thing breaks out...people get killed and chased for a few hours.  The majority of the movie is people running around in the dark trying to hide.  I like the movie better when it was called \\"Alien\\".  Overall, unless you are a huge fan of horror movies I wouldn't be too excited. This is nothing that hasn't been seen before over and over. I give it a C+.
0062119044|1.0|While I believed the concept of this book would be interesting, I am finding the authors writing style to be totally unreadable.  To me, it seems the author concentrated on seeing how many \\"big\\" words she could use to make the book unreadable....very pretentious on her part in my opinion.  The main character is a whinny, self-involved person and I don't relate to her at all.  I am skipping through the book to see exactly what Kevin did at the high school....then I will chose a decent book to read!
B005SODYGA|5.0|I think this is perfect for new fans who dont have a large collection of Rammstein already.  Start with this, then branch out into the albums for omitted tracks and deep exploration of the rest of their music and you are set for a while with some wonderful explorations.  Its not really a \\"best of\\" but a retrospective of all 16 years of their sound.  There is a great new track for existing fans: Mein Land, plus the fun of hearing songs where we all know the song that comes next, we start to anticipate it from the previous albums, but we get a different song instead.  NEW FANS: this is your best bet right here.
B002XUBDVK|1.0|I ordered this product expecting the remastered version of the Gangs of New York blu-ray. Although this is labeled to be the MIRAMAX remastered version of the film which if you read on the web has a significantly better picture transfer than the originally released movie. I would noramlly not be so suprised to receive the wrong edition of the film if i were buying from a thrid party distributer, but this was ordered directly from amazon.com, very disappointing. I will now be much more hesitant when reading descriptions of their products.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|OK, I tried the leather one from Marware.  Sorry, just too cheap looking, too thick, and too difficult to fold.  I tried a fabric case:  too slippery (if you get that one, you'll be buying a new Fire in short order).  I do like the roocase that zippers shut, but it is much larger.  That is OK with me.  But if you are looking for protection with minimal footprint, this is the way to go.  The only improvement that I would recommend is a place to put a stylus.  For whatever reason, my fingers don't work well with touchscreens, so I need a stylus.  But in a pinch, you can put the stylus under the elastic strap provided for keeping the case closed when the Kindle is not in use.  Given how nice this case is relative to the others that you will find out there, I still give it 5 stars in spite of this minor shortcoming.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I had great hopes for this book. It started of well and the author did a great job of  making me care about the main characters. However, at a certain point, the story slowed down and became muddled leading to an anti-climatic, frankly disappointing ending. I wonder if this is what the author had in mind or if it changed during the course of editing.

B005FJ7DOM|5.0|Without question the best movie I have seen in years. I simply cannot remember the last time I got so invested in characters or cried so hard.  Although its genre is horror it was not at all frightening however, it was so good I can't fault it for that.  I would definitely recommend this movie as a must see.

For the child who hasn't had someone like that reach them yet. For a book drive. This book is about funny smart empathetic teens in an age when funny smart empathetic teens are considered not only unlikely but unlikeable.  Reading this book may result in Catharsis.

B0061S073A|4.0|I'm really happy with this app. It keeps my 3 year old from one click purchasing me out of house and home. The only suggestion I have is to create the ability for the children to back out to the menu. Maybe you can already and I'm missing it. When I'm in a game and try to hit the back arrow nothing happens. Give kids the ability to change games. Like I said, I have a 3 year old and her attention span isn't very long.

0525478817|5.0|I just finished reading TFIOS and can't say enough good things about it. It is beautiful and tragic and honest and funny and brilliant. I am not ashamed to say that I cried, and I rarely cry at novels.<br /><br />I feel like the characters might laugh at me for crying; for feeling so much for fictional characters.<br /><br />I'm not going to describe the book other than what I knew about it when I first picked it up. It's about 16 year old Hazel, who has cancer. I think that by not knowing anything more about it, it made the book better. I didn't read reviews because I didn't want to know anything until I could read it for myself. I made the right choice.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful, heartbreaking, stunning novel. Well done, Mr. Green, well done.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I was in the market for a good headset to use while gaming.  A buddy told me about the Logitech Wireless G930s, and raved about the set he had.  I was excited about having a wireless headset, as it would eliminate me rolling over the cord, and ruining another pair of headphones.  But shortly after I started using the G930s did I notice the glaring issue.  While using the headset wirelessly, I'll often have a lot of static, or white noise popping in and out randomly.  Also, the wireless signal to the dock will cut out.  And the wireless receiver that plugs in via extender, is no more than 3 feet away from the headset itself.  When it is working properly, I'm very happy with the sound that comes out of the headset, and being able to walk away from my computer while continuing a skype conversation, or continue to listen to music while I go refill my drink is nice.<br />  To put it simply, the cutting out and the static sounds that come from the \\"wirelessness\\" of this headset really don't make it worth all the money you'd pay.  If I had it to do all over again, I'd just bite the bullet and get a Wired set for the same price, that would sound richer, and more consistent.<br />EDIT: I forgot to mention one point.  This may just be with my particular unit but I also found the power button to turn the headset on and off to be more frustrating than anything. You can hit it and it'll shut off on the first go, or sometimes it will take several attempts. It also doesn't have a very tactile feel to it, so you're not really sure if you're actually pushing it down.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|On a whim, I scene Drive at a local budget theater (all movies $2.00).  The first thing that stood out was the opening music.  As mentioned by someone else, it is a very odd choice but works remarkably well.  This is a well crafted movie; story, action, cinematography, music, acting, etc...  I could see how some people might not \\"get\\" it; sometimes the pace is slow (which I find refreshing as it is done with purpose) or the violence (when it happens) is rather intense and graphic.  I find this move thoroughly enjoyable and quite addictive--I've now seen it four times.  I put it up there with movies like Jaws or No Country For Old Men, which I never get tired of seeing.

Original review deleted by Amazon, along with 100 other reviews of Gran Torino.<br /><br />Throughout his illustrious acting career, Clint Eastwood has delivered a series of iconic characters, such as The Man with no name, Dirty Harry, Josie Wales, and Will Munny in Unforgiven.<br /><br />Throughout his illustrious directing career he has delivered outstanding movies such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby, for which he has won five Academy Awards, for best Picture, Best Director, and including the Irving Thalberg Life Achievement Award.<br /><br />The actors who have worked with him have been blessed with Oscar: Gene Hackman for Unforgiven, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn for Mystic River, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank for Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />In Gran Torino he both directs and acts, and delivers an acting performance that will be remembered long after the final credits roll, in its unique way, as memorable as any other character he has created.<br /><br />Gran Torino is the second best movie I have seen this year. Not just for the acting, not just for the directing, but for the storytelling, and the emotional journey on which it takes you, the laughter, the feeling of being gripped, and its more surprising moments.<br /><br />In the opening scenes, we have the exposition of the character. We get to know Walt Kowalski, by how people act around him, and his seemingly hateful attitude towards people. More is conveyed through a scowl, and a snarl than with words. When the mischievous grandchildren go through his stuff in the basement, we see the Silver Star he won in Korea. There are three other important symbols in the movie, the lighter, the gun, and the car.<br /><br />We see a hero with a warrior past, a patriot who fought for a cause greater than himself. Clearly, his bigotry stems from those experiences.<br /><br />He's not just mean, he's 'get of my lawn' mean. He's Dirty Harry 'Go ahead punk, make my day!,' mean.<br /><br />His dead wife's priest bugs him to hear his confession, at her request. The priest in a way is his wife's conscience.<br /><br />When he snarls down the barrel of his rifle, at the neighborhood punk: 'I could blow your head off, and sleep like a baby,' you get the sense that he means it.<br /><br />So, with all that happens, we see the change in his decision making, from someone reluctant to be involved in his neighbor's affairs, and a story can turn on something as random as looking at an empty beer cooler.<br /><br />For all his faults, Walt has mature masculine character. Even though he is a difficult father, he has taught his children character. So, when he sees the boy next door lacks character, and a strong male role model, he takes him under his wing, and teaches him how to be a man.<br /><br />The scenes where the boy practises Walt's high octane ball busting banter, are the funniest in the movie. Through knowing Walt, he makes decisions he never would have made by himself. In so doing, Walt finds meaning and purpose, and a chance for redemption, and the boy becomes a man.<br /><br />The Academy's actor awards tend to go to actors in two types of role:<br /><br />1.Psychopath- No Country for Old Men, The Usual Suspects, There Will Be Blood, Training Day, Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />2.Mentally Disabled, Social or Physical Handicap, overcomes great adversity or discrimination- Shine, As Good as It Gets, A Beautiful Mind, Ray, Scent of a Woman, Capote, Philadelphia, The Pianist, A Beautiful Life.<br /><br />Every rule has an exception. Russell Crowe in Gladiator played a character with thematic similarities to Walt.<br /><br />For a 78 year old man to direct and be lead actor in a movie of this caliber is an achievement worthy at the very least of being nominated for the highest award for Acting, Directing or both.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.an.

B002VECM6S|5.0|Original review posted Nov 2009.. Deleted by Amazon along with many other original reviews of Blind Side.  Vote totals  115 helpful iut of 130. Save your movie reviews.<br /><br />I go to see movies all the time while they are still in release.<br /><br />At this time of year we have high profile movie offerings like A Christmas Story, New Moon (same vampires), and the world coming to an end with 2012. So. it's easy for this movie to get lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />It would have been so easy to miss this movie, and such a mistake to do so. For, this is one of the best movies of the year, and one of the few I recommend whole heartedly.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock gives probably the best performance of her career, playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, a tough business like mom, who sees big Mike, a young oversized kid who never had a role model, and who never did well academically, because he had no reason to believe in himself. He is the underdog we love to root for.<br /><br />The Tuohys take him in to their plush house, and we get drawn into the experience, perhaps sucked into this story might be a more apt description. Yet Mike has a hidden gift which others like the sports coach can identify, and other teachers start to have faith in him, so who knows what will happen.<br /><br />If you're like me it's a movie about the importance of a mentor and believing in people, the more you believe in them the more they start to believe in themselves. If you like this one, I also recommend [[ASIN:B000G1R38U Akeelah and the Bee]], another five star movie. In its first 14 days The Blind Side has done over $108 million at the box office, assuring that it will be one of the big hits of the year.<br /><br />While the Academy does not typically reward comedies with awards, Sandra Bullock may get a nomination, and so might the writers for best adapted screenplay, and she might win a Golden Globe for her performance.<br /><br />A point of interest in the movie is Lily Collins daughter of Phil Collins who plays Sandra Bullock's daughter.<br /><br />Update, Jan 29, 2010. As she has now won the Golden Globe, which is a dress rehearsal for the Oscars, I expect she will get the Oscar nomination, and it sets the stage for an interesting contest with Meryl Streep for her performance in Julie and Julia. Both actresses played real life characters, with an interesting mix of drama and humor. Although Oscars are not usually given for this type of performance, the exception is Marisa Tomei in [[ASIN:B000SFOW8I My Cousin Vinny]]. I predict this will be the year of the exception. Streep has been nominated 15 times winning only twice. This would be Bullocks first nomination.<br /><br />Update 2/3/2010. The Blind Side has been nominated for 2 Academy Awards, for Best Actress, and Best Picture. As of 2010 the Best Picture category has been expanded from 5 to 10 pictures, partly because of falling ratings, and partly because many popular movies have not historically received the same level of Oscar love, as movies such as The Blind Side has received from the public.<br /><br />Blind Side has grossed over $238 million dollars domestically, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of 2009, and no 63 all time for domestic box office, and it's still in release.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful to you, and I think you will enjoy the movie.now won the Golden Globe, which is a dress rehearsal for the Oscars, I expect she will get the Oscar nomination, and it sets the stage for an interesting contest with Meryl Streep for her performance in Julie and Julia.

0439023521|5.0|I was late to the party hearing about these Hunger Games books by Suzanne Collins.  I got a Kindle for Christmas and decided to check out the first book as my first Kindle purchase.  It turned out to be a great pick.  It was a fascinating take on a post apocalyptic world.  Definitely a quick read, as I couldn't put it down, finishing it in 3 days.  It's brutal, but not not over the top with graphic descriptions and language.  The story moves along very quickly and keeps you turning page after page.  You can tell it was written with the modern, short attention span teen in mind, but it does a great job of keeping even though most ardent reader engaged.    5 star recommendation.

0345456343|4.0|It seems inevitable that with the resurgent popularity of all things VAMPIRE that these books would start popping up again on everybody's \\"to read\\" list. But what's popular now in modern vampire mythos is completely anathema to everything these books are, and I can't help but feel a little sad on behalf of both the unwitting reader picking these up to satisfy what they think is going to be a quick vampire fix, and for the text its self. A quick scroll through the reviews for this and you'll see a lot of reviews starting off with BORING and WHAT A DRAG and I'M NOT STUPID BUT THIS WAS AWFUL. There's something to be said about paring off the right book with the right reader.<br /><br />It's funny, other than Dracula, the great now and always and forever gothic classic of Victorian times, Anne Rice had the only other vampire book to make it onto that much coveted and discussed 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list. And despite this, I think that these books major failing is that, despite it's content, because it uses the super natural as a vehicle for its tale, it has a heck of a time making it into the hands of the readers who would most appreciate this. Interview is not a quick, gory, slick or even a sexy read. Heck, for those of you who like vampire sex let me spell it out to you - the vampires in Anne Rice novels are physically incapable of performing the deed. Looses something right there doesn't it? Instead what this book really is, is a relatively modern look at atheism vs spirituality with more than a healthy meditation on the ability/inability of art to become a working substitute for human connections. If you suddenly woke up one day and found that you would never have to face god, or judgement, would you continue to live as a good person? Does doing something evil render you incapable of normal human emotion? What does it truly mean to live forever? These are the questions Rice grapples with in her debut novel to varying degrees of success, and if she doesn't always find the answer she is searching for, there's something to be said about at least making the journey itself.<br /><br />So no, these aren't like other vampire novels out there. In fact I could say that this is the unvampire novel of the ages, the supernatural book for people burned out on tawdry vampire romances that have no conception of the true passage of time from one age into the next. If you're looking for something a bit more meaningful, if you don't mind that old fashioned Victorian style of writing where it takes three pages to say what could have been said in one line, if you can juggle the eerie feeling of encountering an antiquated set of morals against your own, then give this one a chance.find the answer she is searching for, there's something to be said about at least making the journey itself.

I was VERY annoyed to discover that when I purchased Episode 2, it was actually the 2nd hour of the 2-hour episode that is still available for free on PBS.org. This was very misleading. Needless to say, I feel totally cheated out of my $1.99. Even worse, the other episodes aren't even available yet, which means Amazon will be charging $1.99 per episode for something you can watch for free week-by-week on PBS.org.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|This package is winner if you are an Adele fan!  Clearly this lady is one of the BEST things to come along musically for some time.  Please be aware that she not only sings like a hot, bluesy banshee, she also WRITES a great deal of the best material she's recorded.  She's a force to be reckoned with, and will hopefully be with us for a LONG time!  I was really excited when I purchase the Albert Hall package, very eager to to WATCH this terrifically down-to-earth performer do her magic at a concert that was HUGE for her and with an audience filled with her friends as well as fans BUT...  Unbeknownst to me, there is AN EDITED FOR MATURE LANGUAGE VERSION OF THIS CONCERT!!!  The notation to that effect on the box, is A SMALL LABEL WITH BLACK LETTERING PASTED OVER A BLACK BACKGROUND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BACK OF THE JEWEL CASE... so it is practically invisible!!  I was REALLY IRKED by this and wanted ALL of Adele, not some cleaned up version!!  SO BEWARE... If clean is what you want, just keep your eye out for that tiny black label... If not....WATCH OUT and be sure you buy what you wanted!  The concert CD and DVD is FANTASTIC, and worth every cent and more of what you will pay for it!!  Can't wait for more from Adele... She's a true gift to music lovers!

B0019N94X6|4.0|I've always been a fan of the movie Scarface. One day, a group of my friends and I were thinking about memorable scenes from various movies. Most movies have one or two memorable scenes.  Scarface has a BUNCH!  I can think of 10 monster scenes from this movie at a moment's notice.  I've bought this movie on VHS, LaserDisc, DVD, and now Blu Ray.   When I buy Blu Ray, I look for new information about the making of the movie, and I look for really hot deleted scenes that were cut from the movie in order to maintain an R rating.    With Scarface, I guess all of the hot scenes made it into the Directors Cut, and they weren't so hot.  And I was disappointed that more wasn't said about the making of this classic movie. The Blu Ray release of Troy is my benchmark for additional information on the making of the movie.    So, while I love this movie, and the Blu Ray version has marginal picture quality improvement, I'm glad that I didn't pay $20 for it.   It did contain a copy of the original Scarface movie starring Paul Munni, as I recall it.  I have not finished watching that version.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I got higher scores on most games just tapping with my eyes closed. there are more fun games out there if you just want to randomly poke at your screen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good app for being free, seems easy enough to open more games once u know what its looking for
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I love using this app in the backyard with my son...we watch planes fly over and wonder where they're going...well now we know! I also really like the calorie data available for foods! Great app!!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|you are a jerk for requiring a review in order to install.  one should not need to to use a purchased app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great way to pass time. only issue is games are more for little ones not a whole lot of struggle if ur not a gamer this is a good game for u. no skill really at all needed only bad thing is hate all the freaking adds and pop ups asking u to download now. good concept. works wonderful on the fire.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|This cd is absolutely the best money i've spent. David Gilmore is untouchable on guitar, plus i've been a pink floyd fan from way back. Myself being a drummer i would recommend every guitar player check it out. W.L.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very good app to have on any device, since it's so user friendly and easily accessible. This is a keeper!
0307891402|5.0|I expected a fine product and I got it. I am well into Oblivion and have used its complete book a great deal. I am now just a few hours into Skyrim and the book is equally helpful - or maybe more so.   I've read criticisms about the fine print. I'm 78 and I can read it. Yes it is small; if the font were any bigger, given the huge content, you could hardly lift the book! This is am amazing game and the book is in kind.   There are maps, and my hard cover edition promises more mapping on-line. I say promises because I've not yet needed more than I have on the pages. I like them because I like to sort of know ahead of time what I'm like to meet up with. The encounter is, of course, up to me (or my avatar). The pictures, too, are small --- because there are so many! I sense this game is larger than Oblivion. The book certainly is.   I believe this \\"guide\\" is necessary to fully enjoying the game. You can spec out an area before you go into it, or play it \\"blind\\" and then read what you missed. The latter was the case for me at the start: I wanted OUT of that tower, and there were opportunities I missed in my haste. The book gave me the chance to consider whether I wanted to \\"re-live\\" the experience or just go on.   You have a high quality game; you should appreciate this high quality guide. I recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has a lot of variety. It is great for just quick play but also brings out the competitive side.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Most of the games are good and easy to get points on. But some of them are not good or fun, such as the dirty gold game. Overall, this app is good.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|this app works perfectly to get on my work computer using my kindle fire without a vpn. it can be difficult to control the mouse sometimes but its still extremely useful.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is probably the best RDP I have used to date. It is way cheaper than LogMeIn, and it connects to my computer without any hassle. I also like how you can choose to remember the security key so you do not have to enter it every time you want to connect to your computer. Plus, when I end the session, my computer returns to the optimal resolution right away. Also, playing games like Starcraft and Morrowind (The Elder Scrolls III) is easy and had better graphics than I expected. Applications such as iTunes run easily and quickly. The only problem I have ever had is that other Internet browsers (such as Google Chrome) do not run that fast, but it works. One thing that I would like in the update is to allow you to download software from your computer and download it to the device you are using this application with. Overall, this is a great app and I would recommend it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|To clarify a misconception -- in the \\"product details,\\" the ISBN listed (1449565530) is in error, as is the corresponding number (218) of print pages.  That ISBN corresponds to \\"Volume II, Cosette.\\"  A publisher broke the rather long book into volumes so that they could sell five books instead of just the one megabook, and volume II is 218 pages.  The kindle book is the complete, unabridged edition with all five volumes.  Like all scanned books, it has scattered scanning errors that you can, in general, read through without compromising the experience.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This works just fine with my tablet and klipsch headphones which sound better every day. The amp married all my android devices to the sound I was looking for.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|simple low key games that are pretty good at passing time or playing occaisonally. fills a solitaire like void. not bad.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This review is for the game only! Not the price or the presentation. Ok well this game is pretty good. there is some minor buggs, but it's still awesome! there is 101 games plus 16! That's a lot of playtime! great game, great POSIBLITIES! If you liked this review check out the youtube channel: Theultimatesorafan. Also check out Theultimatesorafan wiki. Thanks !
B006PKQQJS|5.0|this app is the most used app on my kindle fire!! its a fun game that I play everyday! I highly reccomend this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Light quick simple games and then the more you play the more you unlock. Good for a free game but don't pay extra to get more points, not worth it because the simple games that are given. A con would be the constant ads that offer themselves to receive more points. But this is as expected for a free game.
B001KZLN46|5.0|I have to say that is is one of the best heavy metal Cd's that I have ever listened to. Every song is  great, hardcore, and very rhythmic. Unlike War Is The Answer, This album is more than expected, with explicit lyrics and great guitar, and drum playing. This debut album is the best of them all, and will always be the best of Five Finger Death Punch.    I recommend this band and album to any heavy metal fan. If you haven't heard any of this bands songs, then you got to get on the ball and get this album. This is nothing like the new Five Finger death Punch but it is a very memorable hard metal/rock album that has been taken to the a whole new level of the meaning of hard rock..
1416511946|5.0|Wow! I learned so much about Nikki Sixx, and his story is like a lot of other addicts story's that I have heard. I am in recovery and I am also going to school to be a drug counselor. This is my passion. If I can help save just one life, then I have done what my Higher Power put me on this earth for. Thank you.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I can't put forth the words to say just how much I enjoyed reading this book--  why bother with TV or the dog to get a good laugh before lights out, the Ozzman bringeth his bedtime stories instead.....  Chapter \\"Betty, Where's the Bar?\\" is on it's own a classic.   This is what I call the kind of book you keep because you know you'll pick it up again and read tidbits and be thoroughly entertained by a VERY talented storyteller.  That he is still alive to do so is nothing short of a miracle.   This book is also a prime example why autobiographies are so much better--only these rockers tell the stories they way it should be heard, first-person narrative on their families and childhoods and formative years meeting each other and breaking through and partying down like Courvoisier-crazed animals and burnout and resurrection...    Keith Richards \\"Life\\" is a \\"keeper\\" book about a rock miracle.  So is this one; both are edited of course, but you never lose the author's voice.  I felt I was sitting on huge recliner taking it all in, Courvoisier in hand.  Thanks Ozzy, your life is on the shelf right next to Keith's, a true keeper : )
B005K17RU0|5.0|Fast and easy to understand.  Quick look that is very  accurate! Just a click and you can see the weather forecast for the next week at a glance.  A lot easier to use than most weather apps out there.  Just would like to see a real time radar added. Overall, great app!
B004EWFV9K|3.0|This book was very depressing.  It was spoiled by the author's obsession with death and his fear of growing old, something he rambles on about in every other chapter.  It must suck to live in Sweden. The overwhelmingly depressing tone ruins what otherwise might have been a fascinating story.  It is ultimately unsatisfying as well, because many questions go unanswered.  Also, there is no secondary or sub-plot.  When his gun goes missing it turns out he really did forget it because he was becoming senile. How much more exciting if someone had broken in and stolen it in an attempt to embarrass him?  What a very sad and disappointing end to the series.
0439023521|5.0|My husband bought this book for me as a Christmas gift. When I first opened it I was skeptical to read it because I had seen it in the young adult section of the book store. I was afraid I couldn't relate to the book or that it would be too childish for me to enjoy being a 35 year old woman. I couldn't have been more wrong. This book had me gripped from the very beginning. It reminds me a lot of George Orwell's 1984, but with more action and humor. Even though the main characters Katniss and Peeta are teenagers they seem so much older and are very easy to relate to even for an older person. I would recommend this book to any of my friends. Its a very good read.
0439023491|5.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" hit the ground running. Though the initial shock from \\"The Hunger Games\\" wore off, I was able to fully enjoy and immerse myself in the barbaric world of Panem. I do not agree that the book was just biding time for the final installment. \\"Catching Fire\\" raised the stakes and I devoured it just as quickly as the first book.
1439152799|5.0|I have read Kate Morton's other two books (The House at Riverton & The Forgotten Garden), but this was by far her best work!  The writing is beautiful-- she really settles for nothing less than exactly what she wants to say.  The phrasing perfectly describes the scenes, character's thoughts, etc., truly enabling the reader to become engrossed in the story, to experience and understand all that the Sisters Blythe felt.  I HIGHLY recommend reading this book.  I've come across a fair number of disappointing reads as of recent and this was such a balm.  I can't wait for her next novel!!
0439023521|5.0|I waited to read this book, hoping the hype would die down over it. I try to have my own opinion about trends, but I have to say, I am like most of the general population who found this books barbaric, shocking, and an awesome read. The book is completely gruesome and though it is a work of fiction, it had a ring of truth about human nature and how sadistic and awful we can be to one another. This book leaves you thinking, long after you finish it.
B006UAWH2S|2.0|Okay, I get that this is supposed to be a profound reflection on what makes us human and blah blah - I know that because the overwrought soundtrack and shaky camera shots tell me this is \\"dramatic\\" and \\"real\\", but I found this movie pretentious and heavy-handed. Ewan McGregor turns in his usual excellent performance, and Eva Green, looking sickly and half-starved, adds only a little to the plot, although I do think she's a very good actress. I often like artsier films, but I found this one to too obvious in its attempt to get its \\"Oh the humanity\\" point across.
0439023513|4.0|Like most people who gave this series 5 stars (and I totally do!) I have to give \\"Mockingjay\\" a 4 star and here is why: Though I enjoyed how the author wrapped up the story, the tone of the book was vastly different. *spoiler* Katniss spends half this book completely broken, its a complete change from how strong she was in the first two books. Also, though I like some of the choices the author made,  I feel like the last 1/3 of the book was rushed (just when it got really interesting, in my opinion). I enjoyed the epilogue but thought it could be about 20 pages longer. But all in all, a good read, and a good ending to the series.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This connection kit is very useful for my iPad, easy to connect, must have for the many task for this information age.

B001JIFYSA|1.0|contrived tedious boring banal coy dreary lackluster hollow stupid fake monotonous incomprehensible ridiculous and manipulative in a very uninspired way
B0063IH60K|4.0|Exactly what it claims.  It's solitaire.  The ads aren't intrusive. It runs smoothly on my HTC EVO Design. A good pastime.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|How to describe this book?  It is violent and horrifying, and yet tender and innocent.  It is dark, yet hopeful.  It contains action, adventure, political themes and a hint of romance.<br /><br />From the very beginning, I was drawn to Katniss, the heroine living in a post-apocalyptic slum, trying to feed and care for her family, especially her beloved little sister Prim.  The premise of the story is that she is selected to compete in a brutal, politically mandated death match along with a boy from her region, Peeta.  The story unfolds with Katniss trying to survive and retain her identity.  At the same time, she must determine what is real, who she can trust and just how she feels about each situation.<br /><br />The ending is a little bit of a cliff hanger, but only because it clearly states that there is another book (oh, and of course, all the hype has indicated the same).  Had the book just ended without the \\"stay tuned\\", I would have been satisfied.  (Of course, I would have wanted more, but that is the nature of a story well-told).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story and the characters.  Parts of the story may or may not have melted my cold little heart.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the next book, Catching Fire.
014241543X|5.0|This is an excellent book about an out of body experience as a result of an accident.  As Mia looks down at her broken body, and contemplates all the reasons to give up and die......she also has to think about what if I live, and what will that mean for me in the years to come.  The author did a fantastic job leading you through this ordeal.  I loved this book.  The author did a super job with all the characters, and the plot was phenominal.  This is not one of the .99 cents books that you might be accustomed to reading on your kindle, but it is well worth every dime you will spend to purchase this book as you will think about this book for a long time after the last page.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie. She just read the book and having the movie made it come to life for her.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|This book is an easy read for any thoughtful person who wants a better understanding of evolution and natural selection.  It provides overwhelming evidence for why the theory of evolution is the best explanation for how the diversity of life forms on this planet came about.  Richard Dawkins is a true intellect and a great writer!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible app! It's very user-friendly. I'm kept on task everyday with the optional reminders. I highly recommend this to people looking for a Kindle Fire Bible app.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I got this app as the &quot;free paid app of the day&quot; supposedly saving myself 3.99. However as many others have noted, this game is riddled with ads. Way beyond the normal in even a free game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the most additive game I have ever played on my super awesome new kindle &aacute;&aacute;&acirc; &szlig;&szlig;&sect; rockstar
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app, especially all the different reading plans. It has made regular Bible reading so convenient. Highly recommended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Simple and easy to follow. I now look forward to reading the saga of the Bible each day. This provides a good disciplined regimen to read the entire Bible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome app.I love how you can play so many games all on one place. very good download...I love it!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. My friends and I always play it! Its good quality and I like the challenge of completing games to unlock others. I definetly suggest getting this, especially because its free as well. So far no cons. Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is ok you know it is like awesome but some of the game at first it is kind hard but once you learn how to play it is still kind of hard but it is fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was fun and challenging all at the same time aw quite awesome and gun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was easy to read but it wasn't as promising as I have expected from a dystopic book. It doesn't inspire or give you new ideas about life.
B005DOJ68K|2.0|I downloaded the whole album - almost every song has the first few seconds of the introduction cut off. Very annoying. Ruins the album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun games to play all in one amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing
B005GP7F8Y|2.0|Love this movie, truly the transition Western between stagey Hollywood productions and the more realistic 60's Westerns be they American or Spaghetti. ONE-EYED JACKS is as stylish as it is exciting and Brando's performance and direction is top-notch despite some critics' claims of egotistic self-indulgence and an inflated budget and shooting schedule. Karl Malden should have won an Oscar and Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens shine in supporting roles. A very rewarding viewing experience. And I just finished watching it now.<br /><br />Bad Blue-Ray? Full Frame? Sick and tired of this film looking like crap. Feel like Ben Johnson complaining, \\" Get that stinkin' fish outta here.\\"?<br /><br />The dvd I just watched was the DIGIVIEW slim case version, the one with Brando's face in the top corner, with below him Malden and Pellicer and then a group of 5 ruales. It was wide-screened with exceptional color and sound. You'd really have to be nit-picking to hate this version. I enjoyed it very much and can recommend it to all. At least give it a try. You've got little to lose as it's readily available from many Amazon sellers for almost next to nothing.<br /><br />Until a major studio release gives this film the CRITERION treatment it deserves, I'm very pleased with this DIGIVIEW version. It's the best I've seen, and believe me, I've seen a lot of rotten copies of this Western classic.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|A fitting end to the Tron story. Well acted and well photographed with very high tech special effects. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good SciFi film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I 'd never played this game with the choices of &quot;winning deal &quot; or &quot;replay.&quot; Both take it to another level with you getting the chance to really analyze what you did wrong and caused you to lose or you can just play a regular game and not know why you lost or won.  Either choice: cool game!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this really really really sucks. it says it has all the games.  its true but it froze my kindle and the games suck.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|don't know if ill ever get all the games open... don't like yo do the &quot;extra&quot; stuff like I'm doing right now... ug
B005K2XT3I|2.0|I bought this for the kindle fire,i sent to my grandson for christmas,unfortunately it is only a case,and you can't wrk the kindle fire while in the case....my 13 yr. old grandson left the kindle fire  on the floor (not in case) and his 6 yr. old brother stepped on it and it broke. I am now out alot of  money!
B001AQR3JY|1.0|the problem with online purchases is that it takes awhile to find out that the wrong item has been sent and by then you may have no recourse.  I ordered a basic LION KING DVD for my 3 yr, old granddaughter but received a BLUE RAY disc which I've been unable to xchange
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Amazon, you offer the best in a final touch for your product.  I am very pleased with the choice of the Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover.  I was a little skepical about ordering the white color but no need for concern, it will be easy to wipe clean when need be.  It is easy to stand on a surface to free ones hands as they read in either position. The Kindle locks in place to hold sturdily inside the holder with the soft cover. An elastic band secures it in place when closed.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL THAT EVERYONE ENJOYS. THE ORIGINAL MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET WAS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. MY NEICES AND NEPHEWS LOVED IT.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I don't have this game but I could tell I would LOVE this game just by looking at this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have to say that I voted an one star review as helpful. but only because the mentioned review helped me to decided to buy this collection. I don´t know if you can understand me.  I consider myself a devoted fan of THIS Lucas work, I love the story of Star Wars. I already have the complete saga in DVD when I decided to buy this one. Just yesterday I started to watch it. I began with the seventh disc... I felt very pleased with the collection only watching this one, I mean is´t a footage I always want to see before and now I can do it. That why I rated with five stars although a was helped with an one star review.
B006CBSE86|4.0|This album sounds more mature and developed compared to the (relatively) shallow sound of many songs on Dark Passion Play.  This album is better suited to Anette's voice, and overall it is musically more flowing and coherent than DPP, yet not quite at the level of Once or Century Child.  Here's a breakdown:  THE GOOD  Storytime - A good old-fashioned symphonic metal song.  Upbeat, driven, and a solid opener for the album.  Catchy themes and good orchestral bits.  Taikatalvi - Marco sings this one, and I believe he wrote it as well.  The song evokes images of a music box coming to life.  Marco's voice combines with the dreamy music to make a delicate, rich musical experience.  Slow, Love, Slow - When I read hints that Imaginaerum would feature some jazz, I was worried.  Imagine my surprise when the \\"jazzy\\" song turned out to be my favorite.  Anette is stunning in what I can only call Nightwish-y jazz.  Her performance is the best I've ever heard from her, and she sounds genuine and in top form like in no other song.  It's easy to picture her in the old-timey club, walking down the steps in the sparkly gown while serenading the fedora-wearing guests in sultry tones.  I Want My Tears Back - Feels like Wish I Had An Angel crashed into Last Of The Wilds.  The pipes are a favorite instrument of mine, and Troy performs well as always.  There is one thing holding this song back, and it's something I'm noticing more from Tuomas lately - it finds a good bar, then repeats it again and again and again and again and again.  The instrumental part of the song where the pipes, violin and guitar take off could have been so much more epic if Tuomas had been willing to throw in a little variety, but when you repeat the same few measures ad infinitum, you start to wonder why it's not changing.  Overall, it's not enough to make the song bad, but it holds it back from being great.  Scaretale - The weird one.  The obvious imagery is of a creepy carnival, and it works well enough.  This isthe type of song you'll probably either love or hate.  I like it, but let's just say that of all the Nightwish songs that one might imagine hearing on the radio, this is one you'll never, ever hear on the radio.  The orchestra provides a cinematic backdrop that is fitting for what I assume the movie is going for.  Imaginaerum - Turns out the title track is basically an instrumental medley covering the themes of the other songs on the album.  I actually really enjoy this, and it works if you want to listen to the whole album in under four minutes :)  THE BAD  Ghost River - Sometimes I like to visualize music.  I would describe this song as a block of concrete.  Rough, blunt, heavy, and a little ugly.  Subtlety it lacks.  When you get down to it, there's not much of a tune.  The Crow, The Owl, And The Dove - This one's more like vanilla ice cream.  It's an acoustic ditty about how a crow, an owl, and a dove visit the narrator, but he doesn't need what they have.  Musically and lyrically, this is the most boring song I have ever heard from Nightwish.  THE IN BETWEEN  Arabesque - A nifty instrumental with a Middle Eastern flair.  Makes me think of an action chase scene through some fantasy desert setting.  It's fun, but it definitely feels a little too much like a soundtrack and not enough like a song.  Last Ride Of The Day - A cool orchestral opening stumbles into a disappointing chorus.  As I understand it, the inspiration for this song is a roller coaster ride.  The image fits, but the result still falls flat.  Song Of Myself - The last several minutes are a recitation of the Walt Whitman poem by the same name.  I skip to the next track before getting there.  It's a nice orchestral song, but the vocals get too heavy and blunt at times, and the whole thing would have been better off without the five minute poem recitation at the end.  Let the title of the song and the rest of the lyrics hint at Mr. Whitman; don't flash the neon \\"THIS IS BASED ON A WALT WHITMAN POEM\\"sign.  Turn Loose The Mermaids - Acoustic like The Crow, etc, but more interesting.  Not interesting enough to be great, but the tune flows and there's a fun sequence at the end where the violin and drums come in.  Rest Calm - From the opening notes, it sounds like heavy-handed filler.  Fortunately it gets more interesting around the chorus, but it's a little repetitive even then.  So there you have it.  Mostly good, some bad, some in between.  I would give Dark Passion Play two or three stars, so this is definitely an improvement in my mind.  The sound is more developed, the songs are tailored to Anette's voice (especially Slow, Love, Slow), and overall it's a good experience.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so much fun and amazing . there are many of games to play. something for everyone of all ages and genders

B006TLFIAQ|3.0|I've seen this movie before, a few years back.  Is this a new release  date, to sucker people into watching it again, thinking it is a new movie?
B0045JEPXU|2.0|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way) is a 1988 book by The Timelords (Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty), better known as The KLF. It is a tongue-in-cheek step by step guide to achieving a No.1 single with no money or musical skills, and a case study of the duo's UK novelty pop No. 1 \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\"<br /><br />Stupid hooks: Check. Catchy chorus: Check. Devoid of any musical skills: Check<br /><br />Add to that an unoriginal fairly mainstream beat and VOILA! you got the basic idea behind Planet Pit.<br /><br />What saves it from a one star rating is the Marc Anthony collaboration and the fact that I have only heard the songs that have been played on the radio, so I have to be somewhat fair in my assessments. Give Me Everything is a horrible, unoriginal piece of crap song that got overplayed into oblivion on the top 40 radio stations down in south florida. Pit's lyrics are a bit juvenile and one dimensional(ie they are all about \\"girl, i wanna get in your pants and this is what i'm gonna do to you\\" bit). I am happy he's doing well as he is from Miami as I am and it's good to see a local kid do good. But I hope he's smart, makes his money with this crappy album and does good non-mainstream albums in the future. He does have traces of authentic potential to do more on the non mainstream side.Has an original \\"Spanglish\\"style rapping he does, which is pretty original despite its weaknesses. Also, on the positive side, Pit's music is very consistent with authentic 'miami-ness' to the sound(just annoyingly played out on radio).  Would like to see him to a 'rock' album, like Jayz with Linkin Park or Ice T's Body Count.  I thought he was on the right track when he did the cool song with Marc Anthony and Cypress Hill (Spanish Armada) But then he petered out with this mainstream turd. Planet Pit needs to be \\"put to sleep\\"
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Great Movie!  The visuals are superb when they are in Blu-Ray. Definitely like that I bought it at such a good price. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone.   Note: If you expect a great storyline, this isn't the movie. Come in with an open mind and you'll enjoy the movie.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I am in my mid 20s. I bought this game for my parents for Christmas and we had a great time playing it. One of the best things about it is that it is very quick and easy to learn the rules, but there is definitely still a lot of strategy involved that you pick up on as you continue playing the game. Because the rules are so easy to grasp, I would say this would be a great game for families of all ages. The game is really meant for 2 or 4 players, although they do include a variation if you have 3 players. Overall I would highly recommend this game!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|please update faster. fun and additive.  Can't wait for new one. Now my whole family has this game. Keep up the good work
B000EOUSN6|3.0|Billy Joel is the Frank Sinatra of a different era.  I am an Audio Engineer/Producer.  That said, don't waste your money on this so called HD edition.  CD audio is decimated to 44k, 16bit audio no matter the mastering.  If you want high quality, you need to purchase SACD's or a DVD Audio format...both require something other than a CD player to listen to them.  In truth the vinyl versions of Billy Joel would sound BETTER than this overpriced CD.  The SACD's sound wonderful!      This high priced album is after your money, not your ears.  Skip this.
0887307280|5.0|This book was given to me as a gift and I loved it!  I was an entrepreneur for 18 years before I retired at age 38.  I wish I had this book back when I started out!  It's great for the beginning entrepreneur - teaches you how to own your business, so it doesn't own you instead.  So that your business works FOR YOU, instead of you working yourself to death for it.  Highly recommend this book to the beginning business owner, as well as a copy of my book.  - Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A very useful app--available everywhere so very handy. Make notes on your desktop have them available on your phone or tablet.
0688014291|5.0|I didn't read this book until after I retired, but I sure wish I had read it before I retired.  Managing people was always my weakness.  After reading this book, I see how easy I could have made it for myself.  I highly encourage anyone who desires management or entrepreneurial position to read this book, as well as my book.  - Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|The longer I use this app and learn what it can do, the more useful it becomes. My favorite feature is the \\"folder link\\". It's a folder that you can put wherever you want and you can put whatever you want inside that folder. You can mix and match apps, shortcuts, bookmarks, and even place other folders (such as one of your \\"labels\\" inside these folders. Folders inside of folders. Completely customizable. Name, icon.....everything I can think of. Icon database is pretty cool too. This is one very valuable app as far as I'm concerned. It runs flawlessly on my HTC Thunderbolt.
0545265355|4.0|I really enjoyed these books.  The first two books were great.  I was a little disappointed by storyline in the third book.  But overall I really enjoyed these books and would recommend them to anyone.  I look forward to seeing the movie in March.
B002DYKP8S|5.0|Having seen the movie for the second time, I still felt compelled to comment on it like I did several years ago when it came out. I had forgotten how multi-faceted the emotional impact it had on me to see such fine film making and storytelling. This is the stuff of Chinese legends and fantasy at its finest. Merely combining stylish martial arts with gorgeous landscapes weren't enough for the director, he made sure the music and cinematography shared the same vision and the end result just elevated the movie's epic feel into a different realm. I was surprised at how the movie never lost its power to instill a sense of awe at the many exquisitely shot scenes, at the incredible locations, at the scale and the grandness of design.

B004APVI1G|1.0|Amazon's product advertisement claims this is a 3 disc set, including 3D, Blu-ray, and Digital Copy.  Yet product comes in a 2 disc set (Blu-ray and 3D), and no Digital Copy.  Same UPC code on the Amazon site as indicated on the package.  Product is clearly wrongly advertised.  I returned the first set and reordered.  Second set is the same.  It will go back as well.
1594203059|2.0|Ferguson is an engaging writer and his book is filled with fascinating trivia. However, his level of analysis is very disappointing and it feels like he wrote the book in a hurry. It is filled with cliches especially regarding Christianity and the Catholic church. The repeatedly expressed cliche of the Catholic church being \\"anti-science\\" is most jarring. Ferguson seems quite comfortable skipping hundreds of years of European history and having \\"civilization\\" miraculously pop up during the Renaissance. He downplays and denigrates the role of Christianity and particularly Catholicism repeatedly, but really doesn't offer any deeply convincing arguments on why the \\"west\\" ermerged as the global leader in almost everything, i.e. the actual philosophical and intellectual roots of western success.

1594484805|4.0|Daniel Pink argues; and based on his impressive evidence, rightly so, that motivating people through the use of \\"carrots and sticks\\" or rewards and punishment, doesn't work.  What we need to be motivated is autonomy, mastery and purpose (which make up what he calls \\"Motivation 3.0\\").  An interesting argument and one worth noting in our personal and professional lives if we need to motivate ourselves or those around us.<br /><br />My three main take-aways:<br /><br />Point #1:  Pink argues there is a disconnect between what science is learning and what business is doing when it comes to motivation.  Business still believes in Motivation 2.0 - Carrots to reward behavior and Sticks to punish it.  Science meanwhile is figuring out that what we really need is autonomy, mastery and purpose to to be motivated and fulfill our potential.  Pink's examples of \\"FedEx Days\\" (autonomy), his 3 Laws of Mastery - mastery is a mindset, mastery is pain and mastery is the oxygen of the soul - combined with how and why \\"intrinsic aspirations\\" (purpose) lead to the good life; combine to paint a clear picture of why motivation can and should come from within us all and not from the outside.<br /><br />Point #2:  While readily admitting that his \\"Type I\\" and \\"Type X\\" classifications \\"sacrifice a certain amount of nuance,\\" they are useful in giving the reader a simple system to not only remember the book as a whole, but also to add to their personal and professional change toolbox.  Pink begins with Friedman and Rosenman's \\"Type A\\" and \\"Type B\\" behavioral patterns, which most people probably already know.  Next he covers Douglas McGregor's \\"Theory X\\" and \\"Theory Y\\" classifications from  the seminal work \\"The Human Side of Enterprise\\"  Using these antecedents, Pink introduces us to \\"Type I\\" as people motivated by intrinsic desires, while as you would expect \\"Type X\\" are people motivated by extrinsic rewards.  The construct is helpful to me because in it's simplicity is the powerful notion that taking the time to designate co-workers, bosses, family members or friends into one of the two categories allows me to better comprehend their motivations (or even my own) and use that knowledge to help leverage positive outcomes.<br /><br />Point #3:  The \\"Type I Toolkit\\" near the back of the book is chock full of advice for individuals looking for insight into motivation as well as organizations trying to find innovative ways to motivate their teams.  It also includes a reading list that informs much of what Mr. Pink discussed earlier in the book and a quick bio on \\"Seven Business Thinkers Who Get It.\\"  This section of the book provides a unique service to the reader that other writers would be well served to copy.  Like most books in this genre the insights and advice are only as good as the people willing to do something with them.  And in this case Mr. Pink has made that first step that much easier by providing this useful and integrated toolkit.<br /><br />This is a book well worth your time and with motivation being a huge component of our everyday personal and professional lives it should be on the shelf of anyone looking to find that motivation for positive change.at taking the time to designate co-workers, bosses, family members or friends into one of the two categories allows me to better comprehend their motivations (or even my own) and use that knowledge to help leverage positive outcomes.<br /><br />Point #3:  The \\"Type I Toolkit\\" near the back of the book is chock full of advice for individuals looking for insight into motivation as well as organizations trying to find innovative ways to motivate their teams.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love using this app. Easy to use, very functional. It should be a must have for everyone.  It is one of the better and most comprehensive study Bibles out there.

0763644765|5.0|My son of 1.5 years LOVES this book! The wear and tear on this book alone makes me happy that it is a hardbook. I read it over and over and over, he loves to see this little baby, and makes the surprise face the baby makes when he finally uses the potty for the first time :) Great book! No regrets!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|The stickers and the stamps are a nice feature, they draw a picture and then put the stickers on it.  This drawing app is more responsive than others that I have tried, sometimes the drawing apps have a lag time between when you draw and when it shows up on the screen.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|haven't played to much. just installed it. from what ive seen so far I think the more I play the more I will like.
0525478817|5.0|I would not consider this a book review, as you have at least a hundred others to convince you to read it, however, I would like you to consider something.   You will see in reviews here and there people mention the language used by teenagers in this book. In fact, after spending a sleepless night reading this book cover to cover, I came away thinking \\"Kids just don't talk that\\" myself. But then I took a walk at four in the morning in the brisk cold to consider what I'd just read and this is what changed my original opinion.   John Green has often stated that we, as humans, do not imagine others complexly. This book is John Green's hopeful novel of two teenagers that ARE able to imagine others (and their lives) in a more complex manner than what we believe young people are capable of. John, quite simply, believes that young people are more than just surly, angry, underage hormones that walk and talk. He knows that, given the chance, young people are quite capable. They are artistic, capable of critical thinking, compassionate, intelligent and so much more.   This is the story of two such teenagers.

B005N0C0JQ|1.0|I'm a big Noel Gallagher fan, but this album laid a big fat rotten egg.  The songs are good, but their delivery is tiresome and the songs PLEAD for a real singer (such as Noel's brother).  There's no attitude, no swagger, no spirit, no testosterone--nothing but workmanlike material Noel could have phoned in--or even had his secretary phone in for him.  He sounds bored out of his skull--as though he only bothered to grind out this record because his former band-mates did one (maybe it IS time he retired to enjoy his considerable and well-earned wealth).  The whiny vocals sound like Neil Young with a very sore throat after a month-long drinking binge; the CD would have been better as an all-instrumental.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this record; it would have been better if Noel had hired some professional singers to warble various tunes (such as Carlos Santana did on his \\"Guitar Heaven\\" albums).  I do have a little more hope for the upcoming CD with Amorphous Androgynous--perhaps they will layer on heavy production and mask the vocals.  I love Noel like my own son, and this CD grieves me.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|the dvd came sooner than expected and it was in excellent condition it played very well with no problems or glitches. will buy more of these products
B004LGPBZI|5.0|Noel Gallagher's gift for songwriting is missed, but there are some real treasures here--mostly because of Liam Gallagher's larynx and charisma.  His unique voice--ranging from the trademarked grizzly bear roar to a (dare we say it?) almost delicate, dream-like lullaby--has some opportunity to flex its muscles in \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\".  Andy Bell and Gem Archer are very capable songwriters and one hopes to hear more polished songs from them on the next Beady Eye record when hopefully they'll have more time to work with; Liam's writing gets better and better as he continues to spend the effort to compose.  EXCELLENT starting effort from some musicians with REAL courage and nerve.  For the next record, I merely recommend more catches and hooks (Noel Gallagher has more hooks than a bait shop, and these dudes had years at the feet of the master songwriter) and more anthem material to showcase Liam's voice.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun for the kids to keep them occupied while waiting at the doctor's office , some responses lag but it could be my device (Kindle Fire).  Overall, not a bad app

B004UFEJS0|5.0|Not sure what I can say, I love this movie and the values it teaches.  Good story line.  Good characters.  Disney--thank you for another clean, well-made family film.
B0013UN9DQ|4.0|I'm surprised a 10th anniversary edition wouldn't have everything from the album and the cd maxi from the album...where is the etienne de crecy + flowerpistols remix of sexy boy (an excellent remix)? where is the cassius radio mix? I am glad they included the documentary, which is fun to watch - but why not be completist for a 10th anniversary edition? where is the b-side Jeanne? Needless to say, the music is excellent (some of the live stuff loses my attention, but...), as is this seminal electronic album!  The moog cookbook remix of kelly watch the stars never fails to fill a dance floor - when the build reaches the whoo! the audience whoos along while dancing!! fun stuff...
034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers, by Vanessa Diffenbaugh was a fantastic read! I enjoyed the storyline immensely and found the reference to flower meanings really intriguing and was surprised to find a copy of Victoria's flower dictionary at the back of the book! Initially I thought it was a bit lacking in depth, but as the story about Victoria's childhood and her relationship with her long term carer Elizabeth emerged I found myself completely invested in it and connected to the characters as though they were real people. The concept of a novel about love, family and redemption is not uncommon, but Diffenbaugh's unique approach to this theme in the Language of Flowers was beautiful. When a book moves me to tears, as this one did, I know that it was a great book! I think most people would enjoy this novel.
0385342063|5.0|I've Got Your Number by Sophie Kinsella<br /><br />This is the first Sophie Kinsella novel that I have read.<br /> It is a refreshing change of pace from my normal genres of horror and suspense thrillers.<br /><br />Not only has Poppy Wyatt lost her engagement ring, her cell phone has been stolen. After frantically searching for her ring she has a bit of luck and finds a phone in a nearby trash bin.  The phone however belongs to Sam Roxton, who's PA (personal assistant) ditched him and the phone. He wants the phone back for business reasons but Poppy, as her regularly charming self, talks him into letting her borrow the phone by promising to forward all this emails and texts.  Little does Poppy know, her reality is about to take a turn.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the character of Poppy. She was intelligent, funny and authentic; someone I'd want as a friend.<br />The writing style makes for a fast read. The dialogue is a lot of fun as there are lots of text writing, smiley faces and all.<br />I also loved the ending, not only was it romantic but it was not as predictable as I would have thought. It was a perfect ending to a really great story.<br />I've Got Your Number is a light, fun read and I highly recommend it. I do plan on reading other books by Sophie Kinsella to mitigate my reading inventory.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief By Markus Zusak was a wonderfully pleasant surprise for me because it was not what I expected at all. This is the story of a young girl growing up in Germany under Hitler's reign but the story is actually narrated by \\"Death\\". I really thought the personification of Death was going to be morbid and dark, but Zusak gives Death a deeply moving, compassionate and humane voice which is captivating. The characters are beautifully developed and the story will stay with you forever. I definitely recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are confusing at first but after a while you catch on. and the game gives you two things, one.. chews up spair time and two something to improve on aka ur score
0385333846|4.0|This was not what I was expecting at all, but it was so good! I couldn't put it down and ended up reading it in one sitting. Slaughterhouse 5 is a deeply moving story about the bombing of Dresden with an important message told from the remnants of Billy Pilgrim's tortured mind that can seem absurd, but which really makes it all the more poignant. Definitely worth reading!
B000IZC7WG|4.0|This happens to be one of my favorite films.  Every time you watch it, you catch a detail that you missed before.  I think once you understand the concept that the film isn't confusing at all---in fact it is rather beautiful in a very bittersweet way.
0385341008|5.0|WOW! Please read this book if you have not already. It is so beautifully written and tells such a touching story. I cried, but mostly this book makes you smile and even laugh. The characters are beautiful and the way they live as a community and care for each other will touch your soul. I find myself wishing to be in Guernsey amongst such amazing, kind and spirited people. I recommended it for our first book club read last year and everyone loved it! Definitely a favourite.

B005TZFYNE|5.0|In 2009 and 2010, Rihanna quickly released her fourth and fifth albums 'Rated R' and 'Loud' which were musically opposite, with 'Rated R' (2009) being a dark music album with songs about violence, darkness and sadness while 'Loud' (2010) being a fun album with dance-pop songs. I don't own 'Rated R' yet (just heard the singles) so I can't rate it, but I thought 'Loud' was a fun album but it seems it was just too fun for my taste and lacked something, a sound (I'll be posting a review of the album soon). In 2011, she decided to continue with the \\"an album per year\\" formula and released this album 'Talk That Talk', which for me is her best effort to date and combines 'Rated R' and 'Loud' making it a masterpiece. I'll review the songs now:<br /><br />1. You Da One - The album's first track and second single. A nice fun song, but it gets a little repeatitive after a while. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />2. Where Have You Been - The album's second track and fourth single. This was co-written and co-produced by Calvin Harris, the same person who wrote and produced her hit 'We Found Love' also on this album, so it sounds similar to that song. I love this one, it should be a single. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />3. We Found Love - The album's third track and first single. We all know this one, this was Rihanna's eleventh #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 and is a very fun song to dance to, Calvin Harris is a genious writer and producer! I give it a 10/10<br /><br />4. Talk That Talk - The album's fourth track and third single. The album's title track features Jay-Z and it's the third time they make a major collaboration after 'Run This Town' (also featuring Kanye West) and the classic 'Umbrella'. This was confirmed by Rihanna as the third single and a video will be shot maybe in February 2012. Good choice as a single, because the song is great and will do well. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />5. Cockiness (Love It) - The album's fifth track. A different song, despite the dirty lyrics, I find funny how she keeps repeating \\"I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it\\" and it's quite funny. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />6. Birthday Cake - The album's sixth track. This song just lasts a little more than 1 minute, so it's almost an interlude. A full version is coming soon, but this short version is so awesome, looking forward to more \\"cake slices\\"! (Even though the song doesn't actually mean that). I give it a 10/10<br /><br />7. We All Want Love - The album's seventh track. First she sang about how she found love, and now she sings about how everyone wants love. It's a nice song, and shows a cute side of Rihanna. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />8. Drunk On Love - The album's eighth track. It's not bad, but she says \\"drunk on love\\" too many times (it's repeatitive like 'You Da One') so this will affect its rating. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />9. Roc Me Out - The album's ninth track. This is an example of how this album is a combination of 'Rated R' and 'Loud', this has the base of 'Rude Boy' from 'Rated R' and the fun lyrics from 'Loud', it's perfect! I give it a 10/10<br /><br />10. Watch N' Learn - The album's tenth track. One of my favorites, ties with 'Roc Me Out', 'Birthday Cake', 'We Found Love' and 'Where Have You Been', it just has a beat that is really cool. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />11. Farewell - The album's eleventh track (the final track in the Standard edition). A good closing to the album's Standard edition, people can relate to it since it talks about saying goodbye to a loved one. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />I can't review the bonus tracks ('Red Lipstick', 'Do Ya Thang' and 'Fool In Love') since I own the Standard edition, but if I get the Deluxe I'll make a new review on the Deluxe and include those tracks. My conclusion is that this album is a masterpiece, all of the songs are great and there are NO fillers, it's just perfect, I mean compared to her early efforts 'Music Of The Sun' and 'A Girl Like Me' (those are full of fillers, read my review on 'A Girl Like Me') this has no fillers and is amazingly awesome and a masterpiece. I recommend you to get this album.<br /><br />Talk That Talk > Good Girl Gone Bad > Loud > A Girl Like Me (those are the albums I own, I still can't place 'Rated R' or 'Music Of The Sun' since I don't own them yet).<br /><br />EDIT January 25th, 2012: So I've owned this album for some time by now, it's still awesome! Can't get enough of it, it's so awesome, hopefully I'll get the 2 albums missing in my Rihanna collection very soon and review them ;)

B000EQ4G5K|3.0|Rihanna released her debut studio album 'Music Of The Sun' in late August 2005, which featured Rihanna's debut single 'Pon De Replay', the song that made her \\"semi-famous\\" (she became a superstar with the 2007 hit 'Umbrella' from her third album 'Good Girl Gone Bad', if you want look for my review for more on that). 'Pon De Replay' peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it almost could have been her first #1 hit, but anyway... she went on with that album and released its second single 'If It's Lovin' That You Want' that even though is a good song, couldn't achieve the same success as 'Pon De Replay' and was a moderate success that received mixed reviews from critics. Soon after that, she already started working on her somophore album 'A Girl Like Me' that same year and according to her, worked crazy hours promoting the first album and getting the second one done. In early 2006, she released the lead single from the second album 'SOS', which was her first #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and made 'If It's Lovin' That You Want' totally flop and lose all its little success. The song was catchy and made her success grow more. It was just 8 months since the release of 'Music Of The Sun' and 'A Girl Like Me' hit the stores in late April 2006. Now I'll review the songs and then give a comment about the album:  1. SOS - The album's first track and first single. I already said this was catchy, and I totally love it, it's almost impossible to explain its amazingness (and I'm not overrating the song!). I give it a 10/10  2. Kisses Don't Lie - The album's second track. This and SOS are a tie, because both are my favorite songs off the album. The beat and the lyrics are so awesome as well, it's also an amazing song and really should have been a single. I give it a 10/10  3. Unfaithful - The album's third track and second single. At first I thought it was so beautiful (still think so), but now I think it's not the best ballad but it's still very cute. I give it a 9/104. We Ride - The album's fourth track and third single. Weak song and weak single (I wish 'Kisses Don't Lie' would have been the third single), it's dull and I almost hate it. This is one of the album's weak points. I give it a 3/10  5. Dem Haters - The album's fifth track. At first I hated it, but now I like it a lot and I realize this remembers me of good moments from the past, so I almost love it and also its message is great. I give it a 9/10  6. Final Goodbye - The album's sixth track. I used to dislike it and thought 'Unfaithful' was a total masterpiece and this was terribly weak. Now I'm appreciating this a little more and disliking 'Unfaithful' a little, so now I almost like them the same. I give it an 8/10  7. Break It Off - The album's seventh track and fourth and final single. I think it's an ok track, not the best but not the worst. Totally better than 'We Ride' and it proves it since it was in the top 10 in the Billboard Hot 100 (peaked #9) WITHOUT a video, while 'We Ride' failed to chart and it had a video (total flop). I give it a 8/10  8. Crazy Little Thing Called Love - The album's eighth track. This is where the album starts getting very dull and the good hits are over. This sounds a lot like 'Dem Haters', but 'Dem Haters' is much better for sure. This one is just a filler, cheesy lyrics, sounds like the previously mentioned track, and very dull. I give it a 3/10  9. Selfish Girl - The album's ninth track. Woah, so 'Dem Haters' is repeated for the third time? That's total crap (sorry Rihanna, but it's the truth, but anyway I know that by now you hate this album so you won't be offended), as I said the original song is better and this is just too far, although it's slightly better than 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love'. I give it a 3.5/10  10. P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You) - The album's tenth track. The good thing is that this song is different from 'Dem Haters', but it's still weak. Too cheesy for my taste. I give it a 4/10  11. A Girl Like Me - The album's eleventh track. Now, this is an improvement over the previous tracks and makes the album sound great again. Not the best, but definitely not the worst compared to the previous tracks. It has a message that girls like Rihanna can relate to. I give it a 7/10  12. A Million Miles Away - The album's twelfth track. This is a ballad and continues to make the album sounds good. It's cute, still not the best but it's cute and has a meaning. I give it a 7.5/10  13. If It's Lovin' That You Want (Part 2) - The album's thirteenth track and a bonus track in all the album's editions. This is another version of the original song from 'Music Of The Sun' I was talking about at the beggining of the review. It features vocals by Cory Gunz, which I really didn't appreciate. This is NOT a continuation of the original song as it's stated, it just has the same lyrics and additional vocals by that guy, this is actually a remix (which is different from a second part), but it's not bad! I think it's just as good as the original. I give it a 8.5/10  14. Pon De Replay (Full Phatt Remix) - The album's fourteenth track and a bonus track in all the album's editions except the North American. A remix of the single from 'Music Of The Sun'. I don't love it, I don't like it, I don't dislike it, I don't hate it, I just don't care for it. When I listen to this, I don't feel anything, it's just a noise, I love the original but this remix doesn't do anything. Terrible ending for an album. I give it a 0/10  So, when the album starts it's 2 amazing tracks that get a 10/10, then it decreases its amazingness just a little, then suddenly it's horrible, then it starts getting a little good again and then gets very very horrible with repeatitive songs and then a song with cheesy lyrics, then it's good again and keeps up until it ends with pointless noises that don't do anything to the 'Pon De Replay' song. If you want Rihanna's best efforts to date, pick up 'Good Girl Gone Bad' (but make sure you getthe 2008 re-release since it includes the songs 'Disturbia', 'Take A Bow' and 'If I Never See Your Face Again', so obviously it's the complete version, just get the original 2007 release if you dislike those songs). Conclusion: This album is mixed, so it gets a mixed review. Thank you Rihanna for sharing your music.
B001U887Q0|2.0|I bought a pair of these a few years ago and I just loved them.  They were perfect for walking around the house or maybe out on the patio and the soles didn't scuff the floor, the faux fur lining was soft, etc.  but this shoe felt different.  The heel back was shorter so that my heel was exposed more (brrr!) and they just weren't as comfortable.  I sent them back and I'll keep looking.  too bad.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This is good until the trailer for The devil inside starts playing right in the middle of you playing the game. At first I thought my Kindle Fire was possessed by the devil! then I realized it was this app. Why don't they charge for it instead of putting adds in to pay for it and shocking people like that and making them almost drop their kf!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my favorite games! I like all the different options that I can use to make it my own special playing session.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy playing this. My young daughter is fond of the games. It becomes frustrating to try to get points. to unlock games but it is free so can't complain. too much.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this all is ok but it takes a lot to get points unless you spent money but its a fun game for.free
B0063IH60K|5.0|one of those fun time wasters.  love it.  easy and different games.  like that you can change the card decks.

B0058VW36U|5.0|why do so many people want an update? this is a great game as it is. but, it does need more levels
B001EN71DG|4.0|a lot of people are complaining about the picture quality. I too agree that it is unfair that the ORIGINAL version of the trilogy is on here without being cleaned up at all. the quality is not that bad though. everyone is saying it is horrible and worse than a VHS... it is way better. and I dont know why some people have black bars on all four sides of their screen. i know this is non-anamorphic, but I have a very new widescreen HD TV and I only have black bars on the top and bottom of my screen, just like most DVDs should be. I highly recommend this product because you get the best version of the movies available. if you want picture quality and sound, go for the blu ray set. if you want the movies that changed history... get this trilogy.

B00004C8TF|4.0|I have three performances of Zarathustra symphonic poem:  A. Decca, Wiener Philhamoniker / Herbert von Karajan, 1959, Decca CD (24-bit transfer) - this reviewed CD  B. CBS, New York Philharmonic / Zubin Mehta, 1980, Hungaroton (Hungarian) Press (Analogue Vinyl)  C. RCA, Chicago Symphony / Fritz Reiner, 1954, BMG SACD  Short result:  My list as musical performance: A-B-C  My list as technical performance: C-B-A  Explanation:  As a \\"musical indulgence\\", Karajan & Wiener Philharmoniker is absolutely on the top, no doubt. This is the most mystical, the most emotional, well balanced sounding without too harsh brasses and \\"artificially modified\\" tempo.  I am absolutely amazed when I am listening this record from its very fist note until the last one. I feel I am \\"one with the music\\"... This is \\"my\\" Zarahustra.  At the same time, this analogue master tape is quite noisy. The background rumbling is obvious during the whole symphony. I think professional sound engineers could re-master this tape on the highest quality level and they did a great job but, unfortunately, this record cannot be as clear and transparent as a demanding audiophile record nowadays...  Mehta's conducting is another wonderful masterpiece. This is also very good and enjoyable record. Without Karajan CD I would be highly satisfied with this vinyl but Karajan could surpass Mehta in \\"feeling\\". On the other hand, surprisingly, this analogue record from 1980 is very-very demanding from technical point of view too. I also really like it very-very much (on my OrtophonMC-Rega-Rotel-B&W chain). The sound of both the strings and timpani are fantastic. I could hear the best timpani sound from this old vinyl...!!!  As a musical performance, Reiner's Zarathustra is a kind of disappointment for me. But I do not want to describe my subjective feelings because, maybe, someone else can enjoy this kind of interpretation with over-emphasized brass section but this is not mine.  At the same time, technically, this is a very good record (playing on Marantz SA-KI Peral Lite) with wide and deep stage and low level analogue rumbling from the analogue source, in spite of the very old master tape.

0525478817|5.0|I, like many others, waited for this book for a long time and the anticipation did not take away from this book. The Fault In Our Stars is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, honest, and so relatable that it almost hurt to read it at times. This is by far John Green's best work and has already become one of my favorite books. Although this is not a cancer book as Hazel Grace would say, I think if you have been touched by cancer in any way that this book will speak to you. An honest look at what it's like to be 16, falling in love, and terminal.

B0058YZEWW|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for our son-in-law.  He has taken up running and looked up information about barefoot shoes.  He was intrigued by the comparisons of this shoe with the barefoot runners around the world that are doing so well in marathons.  It took a little time to get used to the shoes, but he loves them. We live in Colorado and have had a lot of snow and ice on the ground.  That hasn't stopped him from running in these shoes. We purchased the shoes from Amazon.com and they arrived before Christmas in perfect shape.

B005UT29Z0|3.0|\\"Margin Call\\" is basically the story of a mythical Wall Street firm (that bears more than a passing resemblance to Lehman Brothers) at the beginning of the 2008 financial melt-down. It opens with the Firm laying off most of its middle managers in ruthless fashion. It quickly develops that the firm has recklessly invested in mortgage derivative products and is about to incur losses that will destroy it utterly. This develops with a reasonable amount of tension, but it is hard to make a movie exciting when the most dramatic moments are of a bunch of actors staring at a computer screen showing financial projections. There are a lot of scenes of executives looking at the numbers and dropping the F-bomb.<br /><br />This is an interesting movie and pretty true-to-life. Demi Moore, not usually a favorite of mine, plays to perfection her role as the Firm's risk management executive (whose negligence was key in destroying the firm.) The rest of the cast turns in pretty authentic performances and deserve kudos.<br /><br />Overall, this film comes together pretty well and highlights some aspects of the recklessness that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Worth watching. RJB.
B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to use. fun, brainless, much like the original. lots of options to customize to make the game how you like it. great game- especially for free!

B001OQCV6K|4.0|Great movie, nice price, got the digital copy for immediate viewing. I am more than satisfied with my Amazon purchase.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is so cool I just want to play it all day I love it! I am so glad I downloaded it!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Very sturdy and well build.  Sound is a above average B+.  Use your equalizer to stable to your preference and jumps to a tough to beat for the price A.  I use mine extensivly at home because im using a laptop and I take it to work with me.  The battery lasts over 8 hours of all night pumping base intense house music.  Just what I was looking for at the price point value I seeked.  Has a base boose thats an over kill.  Track and volume jog work well on Android and Winamp.  Issue with pairing sometimes on the PC.  Minor issue.  Just resetart your PC and speaker.  Thats sums it up.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun times abound. not all games are fun, but are easily. skipped over. some control issues, but not on all games
B004EPYZPS|5.0|the first 75 minutes was a tour de force, excellent film-making!  the end got a little predictable and sentimental, but still good.  yes, it's a homage to earlier spielberg movies, especially ET, and a little close encounters.  still, the script is outstanding, funny, and heartfelt.  the kids are excellent and clever in a realistic way.  born in the 70s myself, a little nostalgia is always welcome (i can remember when i painted action/fantasy figures too/model trains... the days before video games and internet!!!!)  thumbs up !!
0525478817|5.0|John Green never fails to write something amazing and The Fault In Our Stars is no different. It is beautifully written and is truly a book that will have you laughing out loud and crying all within the same novel. I highly recommended this to anyone, boys, girls, young, and old. All will enjoy it(:
1594744769|2.0|I loved the opening chapter. To me there was something very compelling about a grandfather, the only member of his family to survive WWII, using stories, and magic and monsters to explain his experiences to a grandchild in terms he would understand. It seemed he was creating his own mythology, perhaps as a coping mechanism. I wanted to know more about that.  Read a little further however, and we find that fleeing Nazi Poland as a Jewish child wasn't horrific enough for the story apparently - no, there are ACTUAL MONSTERS who like to eat to eat little children. What a disappointingly archaic story line.  The book included several bizarre vintage photos, often manipulated by old school techniques. Again this is something that could have been really interesting--there certainly are a lot of creepy/funny photos out there--but they were misused. Most didn't seem to line up with the time period in question, and they also seemed to be a bit of a plot crutch, forcing the story's details to stretch around a few irrelevant images. I'm just not sure they improved the overall reading experience.  None of the characters are particularly well-developed. The writing is essentially a detached description of events--I didn't get a sense of much emotion. Overall, I just didn't find much to engage with at all.  Inevitably this book is designed as the first in a series, but I don't really want to read more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it encourages you to purchase points but unlike some games you can still unlock everything without buying or paying for anything.
1419702238|5.0|Im not the one reading it so I couldnt tell you about it. My little boy loves them, so if they make him happy then im pretty happy to then i guess.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is a rollercoaster ride of a read. Are they two 'messed up' people messing each other up more in a relationship? Yes. Is Travis the archetype Bad Boy? Yes. Are there some vaguely improbable bits to the story? Yes. Does it matter? No. Does it portray young adults behaving in extreme ways, expressing extremes of emotion? Yes. Does it 'teach women/girls that its okay for a boy/man to be violent or abusive or a stalker'? No.  Is it well-edited and proofed? Yes.   I read this book in one sitting, the writing was riveting. This author knows how to captivate her reader. Some books attempt to portray the \\"'slut bad boy' falls in love with chosen one and then changes\\" storyline and it fails miserably. But 'Beautiful Disaster' worked. The relationship was convincing. The characters were intriguing. The novel kind of slams into you and leaves you a little breathless to be honest. I'm defn getting more books by this author.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|at least it was great from what the wife and kids told me. I sorta fell asleep in the recliner again. they all seemed to love it and want to watch it again sometime. thank you
B004XISI4A|5.0|another excellent book in this series. Im in awe of how Martin weaves so many different strands together and keeps track of so many characters and plots. I do hate how he keeps killing off my favorite characters though and I'm annoyed that I will have to wait ages for the next book.

B0060FXBNM|2.0|So tempted to give the trilogy packaging 1 star...  Each of the blu-ray movie packages are 1 disc. The first two movies 1st discs both say \\"Disc 1 Feature Film\\" so where's Disc 2?  A special feature on the Transformers blu-ray called h.u.d. (heads up display = trivia information) mentions \\"See Disc 2 for more information on primacord\\".  Where's Disc 2?  There is \\"bd live\\" functionality which allows access to other special features if you have internet access.  Still, the question about the h.u.d. where it said \\"See Disc 2 for more information on primacord\\".  I haven't watched all of the items on bd live, but couldn't they have changed that quote on h.u.d. to say \\"See 'bd live docummentary [entitled...]' for more information on primacord\\" if it is available live?  I remember on the DVD there was a deleted scene at a pawn shop in Mission City where the walkie-talkies where purchased.  The \\"bd live\\" has two deleted scenes, neither of which are the one at the pawn shop.  They didn't think we'd miss it I guess.  At this point, I'm still feeling like somethings missing.  I enjoy special features.  If I knew this trilogy did not contain all of the material (2nd disks), I would not have bought it.  On Transformers: Dark of the Moon blu-ray included in the trilogy, you can change to various subtitles and you can change the audio settings, that's it. There are no commentaries, \\"bd live\\" or any other special features. Booo

B004G81XBW|5.0|I just finished watching the Animatrix with my daughter and she loved it. These short stories were so insightful, tragic and made you realy think about yourself and the world in which we currently live.<br /><br /> My next step now is the watch the Matrix Trilogy with her.
0765350386|2.0|On the good side of this novel, the actual writing is very readable and the world that has been created is enjoyable. While the 'magic' in the book is a bit video game like it is an interesting and fun concept. I was enjoying things for the most part until about two thirds into the book when I started getting what seemed like a very Mormon message. As Sanderson is a Mormon I was not surprised. The whole idea of a corrupt god-like religious leader who cruelly rules the people and a martyr who will lead the people to REAL happiness seems a bit to close to the Mormon story for me to enjoy it. I am not a Mormon and by no means too knowledgeable about the Mormon faith but felt like this story pushed a little too much of a religious message on me. I have no problem with people putting there faith into their writing, it just may not be for everyone.

B006JPS1OM|3.0|The game is fun, and a good HOG, however during the mini games between the hidden object scenes, it was impossible for me to navigate and finish half of them! I would expect for a $5 game to work well with touch screens.  The plus sides: it was long, and a great HOG game.

0525478817|5.0|So I bought this book for my kindle and when I read it I knew I had to buy it as an actual book, it was that great.

Thank you amazon!

0525478817|5.0|I normally wouldn't write a review on a book when there were already so many reviews posted. (132 as of the time I'm typing this) because normally adding a review at this point creates the same effect as dropping a pebble in the middle of the ocean. But this is such a unique emotional and touching story... that I decided if my view on it would positively affect even one person then it was worth the effort. Being that I have been blessed with the gift of life for what will be NINE-YEARS on February 13th after almost dying during *BRAIN TUMOR* surgery... and being given the additional gift of seeing and enjoying the birth of two Granddaughters since that fateful day... this book hit home in many ways.<br /><br />The first important point I would like to make to potential readers is that though this is advertised and listed as a book for young adults... which it obviously is... it is also perfect for Parents and Grandparents like me. And obviously if you summarize what I just said... this book is an emotional gem for any human being with the type of heart that poets write about. This book is narrated through the character of Hazel a 16-17 year-old teenager who has lived her short life revolving around tumors... lung problems... and a young life that makes it almost an oxymoron to talk about the future and any length of life. Being that I'm a tumor survivor myself... this book made me realize once again... what I  really already understood. Young or old... when an uncontrollable health or medical issue is stamped onto your life (as it was)... there is immediately an ascension into an inner-private-world... that believes no one truly understands you and what you're going through... and at the intersection of gallows' humor... and anger... something... or someone... has to be let in to your very personal soul... because you're about to descend into an awful reality... that as unbearable as you know it will become... will only become more bone-chillingly-harsh... if you don't find someone you can really lean on... trust... openly share your most hauntingly vivid fears... and dreams of what happens when you're gone.<br /><br />The author does such a wonderful job in touching any reader even though his literary voice is through a sixteen year-old-girl. Early in the book (since I'm an \\"old-man\\") it bothered me reading my thoughts through this youngster... but midway through the book... Hazel really became *MY* voice with \\"our\\" thoughts and it became as natural as can be. Even though the author strongly reminds the reader in the beginning of the book: \\"THIS BOOK IS A WORK OF FICTION. I MADE IT UP. NEITHER NOVELS OR THEIR READERS BENEFIT FROM ATTEMPTS TO DIVINE WHETHER ANY FACTS HIDE INSIDE A STORY. SUCH EFFORTS ATTACK THE VERY IDEA THAT MADE-UP STORIES CAN MATTER, WHICH IS SORT OF THE FOUNDATIONAL ASSUMPTION OF OUR SPECIES. I APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION IN THIS MATTER.\\"<br /><br />Despite the author's strong warning... I was so touched as the story unfolded... that despite the warning... I couldn't help but have my thoughts and emotions grapple with the thought of real people's lives being the catalyst for this story. I expected to have my hands smacked with a ruler for such thoughts. Besides Hazel and her equally ill young love interest Augustus Waters... there are a brave cast of terminally ill children that will make you thank the Lord silently for your health or your families... as I do every day of my blessed life. Some of the dialogue is pure poetry... and what makes the poetry even more powerful and inspiring are  the deeper messages that seem to almost always be entwined. One of my favorites regarding love... coincidentally also happened to come about right when the book and Hazel's voice completely engulfed me, and I was originally going to use it as the title of my review. ** \\" I FELL IN LOVE THE WAY YOU FALL ASLEEP: SLOWLY, AND THEN ALL AT ONCE.\\"<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier... this book is perfect for all ages... well, it's ALSO perfect for real life victims of the debilitating diseases... AND for their loved ones. The author not only resolutely defines the agony and relentlessness of these murderous childhood killers... but he exquisitely shares the pain and anguish of loving parents who in the midst of their own hearts and lives being slowly destroyed... try to do the right thing by their very own lifeblood... their own young flesh and blood... their children.<br />** \\"MY DAD JUST KEPT TELLING ME HE LOVED ME IN THIS VOICE THAT WAS NOT BREAKING SO MUCH AS ALREADY BROKEN.\\"<br /><br />It's not too often you are totally touched by a book... and it WILL affect you. As Augustus so aptly said: \\"THAT'S THE THING ABOUT PAIN... IT DEMANDS TO BE FELT.\\"<br />Having personally been through many things discussed in this book... I have had a few hard to define experiences crystallized a bit in retrospect. \\"GRIEF DOES NOT CHANGE YOU... IT REVEALS YOU.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to your entire family.f the debilitating diseases... AND for their loved ones.

B004V6BQ3O|2.0|It's better than the built-in mics in the Nikon bodies, yes. It's a stereo capsule, yes. It's convenient, yes. And that's the best I can say for it.  I was an early, first-week adopter - paying $180. To my ears, not only would it rank as the worst $180 mic (or even $130 mics) I've encountered ... it would be among the worst $50 mics I've known - if *that's* what it sold for. It is, to input - what laptop speakers would be to output (well ... almost. Perhaps I'm being overly cruel). If you're hanging around Trafalgar Square and just want the stereo ambience of the fountain and traffic swirling around you, fine. And, at reasonably close distances, speech is intelligible - that is, you know what people are saying.  But ... a $100 Zoom digital recorder I've heard - with built-in mics in tow - will walk all over this stereo mic. Though, yes - you'd have to sync-up the sound later using what can be somewhat pricey software for many - plus the extra time involved, naturally. Still, I *do* begrudgingly use this mic - when I want coat-pocket, phantom-powered convenience. But for farmed-out, Far East production, Nikon could have done *much* better in this price range. In fact, it *may* be, relative to its price, among the worst products carrying the Nikon name I've known (including their old 43~86 zoom lens - and that's *saying* something).  So, again - for the convenience, not so much for the sound which is only - yeah, better - than the built-in mic ... multiplied by two, revealing less handling and motor noise. That's about it - and the only reason I give it a highly charitable 2 stars.  Sorry.  MAYBE I got a dog unit ... but I don't *think* so.  A shame.

B005KJZDXK|5.0|This album makes me feel like Christmas. It's light-hearted and wonderful to play in the background during a party, decorating, baking, or just all the time.
0553801473|4.0|Now there are a lot of reviews on here that paint a very fair picture of this book. Personally, I found it a very enjoyable read. Many reviews claim that this book is essentially nothing more then a bunch of people running around doing things only to end up back where they started. I believe these people did not read the beginning of the book and, if they had, may have felt differently.<br /><br />This book IS NOT a sequel to Feast of Crows, it SHARES the timeline with Feast of Crows. So, obviously, you will end in the same place as the last book because they tell the same story. With that knowledge you can read the other reviews and see if they are fairly judging the book based on that information or if they thought it was a continuation from Feast of Crows. It makes a major difference in how you perceive the story.

B006MHWXMS|4.0|It was a bit confusing initially, but once I got the hang of it I really went to town. I have many home improvement projects and this app helped me set them up. It got me so psyched I got several projects in motion and contractors already coming for estimates. The trick is to set up the lists for each project in the left column; then you do the task list on the right by project. It's great once you get the hang of it. Took only about an hour before I was going for it. Thank you for a great tool. I hope the developers add a field for tracking estimates...that would be very handy to be able to list them all and get a total. If this app was a bit easier to figure out I would definitely have given it a 5. Really love it!

B004SKJTY6|1.0|When I saw the run time listed as 5 minutes, I knew that this was not the actual movie, so I began to look all over the description to find where it said that it was a preview and not the movie itself.

B0029OR9JU|5.0|The album comes in good and goes out with with a bang. i only wish it was longer, but because it is so short I think it sticks with you longer. If you have the chance, go find the translations.. the song's are pure poetry. I'm glad I purchased this..
B000002WUD|5.0|Soulful, long sideburned, white jumpsuited Elvis at his most creative. Every song he sings, he makes it his own. Every song he means to the bottom of his soul. I think I like this stage of Elvis more than the 60s Elvis. If you're not an Elvis fan, you might not understand. But if you are, this will be one of your prized possessions. Don't think, just buy it.
B00000F14B|3.0|I love most of the old-time musicals of this era and most of them have held up very well....Oklahoma, Carousel, the King and I, the Sound of Music....to name a few off the top of my head.  I never did see this when it came out and now I know why....it's dreadfully boring!  My relatives are from Iowa and I have great fondness for the place and this era of innocence...But my...now I can see why they got out of there!  Boring....!  My father played cornet in a band and loved Sousa marches and I loved my father so I have a lot of reason to love this musical. I love Shirley Jones, Buddy Hackett, Hermione Guingold and even Ron Howard. So I tried to like this film...I really did.  But I found myself fast-forwarding through many of the dreadfully long numbers and finally just quit.  It's well cast.  Robert Preston is perfect as the fast-talking con man, and Shirley Jones is the quintessential wholesome home-town beauty.  I can see that this was a labor of love for Meredith Wilson and I'm glad, for his sake, that this was so well-received.  But, gee...the plot is so thin that you know from the get-go what's going to happen, the music is just not very interesting, the dance numbers are enthusiastic but not very original and....it's long, oh so long.  Still, there are a lot of folks who love it...so you may be one.  Just don't expect the charm and originality and depth of drama of most other musicals of the era.  The fact that it beat \\"West Side Story\\" is utterly amazing.
B0063GORYU|4.0|love it in general but had to undo part of a game due to a card dealt face down.  couldn't flip it rightside up without a re-deal.

B0009P66TK|5.0|Guys, This watch is really a great watch, I like it so much !! I`m a big guy, my wrist is not that big though  but the watch still fits me very well, The watch has a big Black face (45mm), and actually the best part is  this watch is great for every day use, and also perfect for formal occasions (interviews, weddings, ...etc)  The only thing I don`t like about the watch is the wrist band, the leather is a bit tough, maybe cos the watch   is still new -I`ve had it for just 2 days now- I dunno, however, this will not stop me from givin` it 5 stars !!     A great watch, especially for the price !!

B004E2XAHK|2.0|The music on this album reminded me very, very much of 1980s rock.  1980s rock was fine...in the 1980s.  There are plenty of great 80s bands to listen to.  I got Within Temptation's The Heart of Everything and loved it so much.  Dark, beautiful, absolutely wonderful music.  This album is not that.  The songs all kind of sound the same.  It's just not memorable.  The best way to describe it is to think about the soundtracks for movies & tv shows made in the 1980s.  It's music that works well with a scene, with something else going on, but it's not something that's enjoyable on its own and likely won't bring Within Temptation any new fans.  I should've been sad when I saw that my dogs had gotten hold of it and scratched it beyond repair because I'd only gotten to listen to it once.  What was sadder was that I didn't care.  It's just not worth a second (or first) listen if you're expecting something like their previous albums.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great read and interesting concept.  I love how the author tells the story from the main characters point of view and then shows how the stories are embellished and added to creating a fiction that barely resembles the original events.  The first book took me a day and a half, and I immediately bought and read the second on my kindle.  I can't wait for the third book and I wish amazon had a way of alerting you when your favorite authors put out their newest books.  Can't wait for the next in this series.

0374275637|4.0|A scientist's look at how we think  Review of Kahneman's Thinking, fast and slow by Paul F. Ross   A friend called Kahneman's book to my attention.  I purchased it immediately and put it at the top of my stack of \\"to be read\\" books.  Having finished the read just a day ago, writing my impressions immediately is important to catching the details of my observations, the yin and yang of this book.  The work, indeed, captures my high interest.  Kahneman, psychologist at Princeton University, is known for his work on understanding people as they interact with \\"the economy,\\" work Kahneman did in concert with Amos Tversky.  The work won the 2002 Nobel prize in economics for having persuaded economists that humans, contrary to the assumptions long a part of economists' theories of people as economic actors, do _____________________________________________________________________________________  Kahneman, Daniel  Thinking, fast and slow  2011, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York NY, vi + 499 pages  _____________________________________________________________________________________  not always consider all the information available to them and make choices in their own individual best interests with respect to wealth.  The difference between Econs and Humans, these labels adopted from today's economist Richard Thaler, is one of the continuing themes of Kahneman's story.  Daniel Bernoulli (d. 1782, he and Adam Smith working at the same time ... there being not a single reference in Kahneman to Adam Smith) proposed that people make their economic choices so as to maximize the decision-maker's own wealth.  Kahneman sees too many economists today, including several from the highly regarded (University of) Chicago School, as accepting this erroneous view of economic actors (as Econs) and failing to understand that people (as Humans) are influenced in their choices by many circumstances well beyond the decision's outcome as it affects the decision-maker's wealth.  This book is Kahneman's explanation for the general reader about the work which won the Nobel prize.   In thirty nine chapters divided into five parts, Kahneman makes distinctions between Econs and Humans, between associative memory that thinks fast using simplified relationships (he calls it System 1) and analytical mental processes which think slowly and, prodded into doing work, can cope with complexity (he calls it System 2), between heuristics and biases in thinking, between choices as Econs make choices and choices as Humans make choices, between the influence of the decision's frame and the details of the choice itself, between broadly framed decision-making and narrowly focused decision-making.  The publisher reprints as appendices the 1974 paper in Science by Tversky and Kahneman (Judgment under uncertainty: heuristics and biases) and the 1984 paper in American Psychologist by Kahneman and Tversky (Choices, values, and frames) which were key steps in winning widespread recognition for their work.  \\"Prospect theory,\\" described in their 1984 paper, was a step in their thinking that showed the sharp distinction Humans make between gains and losses.  Kahneman and Tversky can be classified among the behavioral economists who do experiments with people in choice-making exercises to uncover the regularities and irregularities in, the influences upon, peoples' decisions.   I thoroughly enjoy this work by Kahneman (Tversky died in 1996) especially because it shows so distinctly the observed-in-experiments, evidence-based foundations for psychology and psychology's claim to understanding human behavior.  I enthusiastically recommend the read for those thoughtfully interested in people and people-effects on our individual lives as well as our shared lives in organizations, governments, and cultures.  Walk up and down the aisles of the local large bookstore looking for psychology and one finds self help books that present \\"ways to think about\\" our lives, implying by their very structure and presentation that all one needs to do to understand self and others is to take thought.  That's pure nonsense, yet that's the modal view - actually it's almost the only view - of how psychological science gets built.  For those willing to read the footnotes, Kahneman thoroughly undoes this view.  Psychology, as all psychologists should know, is built upon empirical investigations of human behavior.  It is something of a bitter joke that it should take two psychologists to persuade economists that human beings make economic decisions using inputs well beyond the wealth-maximizing rule posited by Bernoulli in the 18th century.  Yet, as Kahneman states so clearly in his chapter titled Conclusions, there are still many economists who continue to use the Econ model of the human being as the individual economic actor.  The subject of economics is taught in universities with Econ as the decision-making universal actor for all humankind.  The Econ model is simply incomplete as a model for the individual actor and obviously even has its difficulties in accurately forecasting group behavior as we are learning through hard lessons in our inadequately understood attempts in Keynesian economics following the 2008-2009 economic downturn, efforts we make as we grope for economic recovery.   Begin reading Kahneman's book by first reading the chapter on Conclusions, the last in the book.  While that may prove a bit difficult because of the unfamiliar concepts presented as key words or phrases (Econs, Humans, System 1, System 2, prospect theory, utility theory, etc. etc.), the reader can quickly learn some of the handles that Kahneman uses and, particularly, the view of politics and society from which he thinks and writes.  Then, of course, read the Conclusions again as you finish the book.   Very much admiring this work by the behavioral economists and by the neurobiologists in exploring human behavior with respect to economic choices, I'm also critical.  Psychologists andthoughtful readers need to know not only the achievements of this work but also its shortfalls ... thus perhaps avoiding frustrations in the reading and errors of overgeneralization for the findings.   First, one of the rules of science is that it seek the simplest possible explanations for the phenomena being explored.  Kahneman has the difficult task of speaking from and to both psychological and economics backgrounds, sometimes also adding neuroscience.  In taking on that task, he refers to concepts and data from all three disciplines.  Sometimes the concepts are closely related, almost duplicates.  Needing to communicate with two or three highly specialized audiences, Kahneman uses the several terminologies and offers the reader no charts or tables listing, classifying, and simplifying the concepts.  A tour through the book's index turns up ...  affect heuristic, anchoring index, associative coherence, associative memory, availability cascades, baseline predictions, base rates, broad framing, broken-leg rule, causal base rates, causal stereotypes, cognitive ease, cognitive illusion, cognitive strain, coherence, competition neglect, confirmation bias, conjunction fallacy, decision utility, decision weights, decorrelated errors, default options, disposition effect, duration neglect, duration weighting, econs, ego depletion, emotional coherence, endowment effect, evaluability hypothesis, expectation principle, expected utility theory, experienced utility, flowers syllogism, focusing illusion, fourfold pattern, halo effect, happiness, hedonimeter, hubris hypothesis, ideomotor effect, indifference map, joint evaluations, judgment heuristics, law of small numbers, less-is-more pattern, loss aversion, loss aversion ratio, mental shotgun, narrative fallacy, narrow framing, negativity dominance, neuroeconomics, norm theory, one-sided evidence, optimistic bias, outcome bias, peak-end rule, planning fallacy, possibility effect, precautionary principle, preference reversals, pretentiousness language, priming, probability neglect, professional stereotypes, prospect theory, psychopathic charm, rational-agent model, reciprocal priming, recognition-primed decision, reference class forecasting, retrievability of instances, risk assessment, risk aversion, risk seeking, selves, single evaluations, somatic marker hypothesis, structured settlements, sum-like variables, sunk-cost fallacy, System 1, System 2, theory-induced blindness, utility theory, validity, vividness, wealth, well-being, WYSIATI  ... and this is indeed a complex mapping of what is intended to be a joined and simplified configuration explaining human thinking particularly as it is exercised in decisions about economic choices.  I respect Kahneman's intent.  His characterization of System 1 and System 2 is an important and simplified communication.  I think he could do an even better job at simplifying what he is teaching, particularly by using tables and other means for classifying, grouping, his concepts.  Of course, other bright people have similar problems.  The physicists have their Standard Model of seventeen particles and forces classified as fermions and bosons, quarks and leptons, and that is not simple enough to allow the rest of us to keep firmly in mind what these seventeen particles-forces and several classifications mean ... nor does it explain mass, astronomy's dark matter, or even gravity!  Communicating science simply often is no easy task.  However it is an essential task if science is to have any use beyond mental stimulation.  This reader demands that science, in its most valuable form, be useful.  Communicating science simply is a task that must be mastered on the way to making one's science maximally useful.   Kahneman, as do the behavioral economists generally, is reporting experiments that have been run, primarily, with college students as participants ... and not even with a representative group of college students.  They come heavily from UC Berkeley,U of Oregon, Michigan U ... very selective places where Kahneman and Tversky have taught and their graduate students have done work in the mode of their teachers.  A few years ago I entered a conversation with a respected colleague, a colleague much better informed than am I on these matters, at The Ohio State University.  \\"Psychology built upon studies with college sophomores must be questioned,\\" I insisted.  \\"Not so,\\" he responded.  \\"The work frequently generalizes well to the general population.\\"  The work Kahneman highlights so well in this book is work built heavily upon experiments run with college students as the participants.  Despite these assurances from very able scholars, I cannot brush from my memory the very impressive account that Herrnstein and Murray (1994) presented in their controversial The bell curve which followed a representative cohort of American youth through a rather lengthy part of their life span (maybe age 12 to age 42 ... I don't recall accurately and, as I write now, am setting aside the task of looking it up).  The work showed that life as experienced by youth at the high end of the bell curve on intelligence was a very, very different experience from life experienced by youth at the low end.  Those at the low end seemed to find life a blooming, buzzing confusion and they got into lots of trouble.  Their minds worked differently from the minds of their peers who found themselves to be college eligible and, in many instances, got that education.  The evidence was overwhelmingly clear in life's outcomes (current income, marriage, need for and use of social support networks, use of drugs, crime rates, divorce, time in jail, . . .).  The people in this longitudinal study had not yet reached the ends of their lives!  Having taken the Herrnstein and Murray findings to heart, I think I might be relatively safe in transferring what I learn in Kahneman's book to the professionals and executives I have met in working with organizational leaders, but I'm still not convinced, despite my colleague's assurance from his superior and more current knowledge, that findings learned with college students as the participants can be assumed to be true for all human beings.    The behavioral and management sciences (psychology and economics included) receive a tiny fraction of the world's R&D funding.  They are regarded by the college educated populations of the world as second class sciences, at best, and probably not sciences at all.  Kahneman's book is a stout statement very much, and appropriately, in the face of this non-knowledge.  But to win public support and public funding, to have what is known by these sciences at work in reducing problems that the world faces every day, to see these sciences contribute practices that enhance human well-being, it is absolutely essential that what the sciences know be communicated to opinion leaders - those who escaped college without having learned much about these sciences - in a way that is accurate, clear, and understandable.  As shown by the list of ideas from the index of Kahneman's book, I think Kahneman has not yet formed the clearest and most communicable framework for his core ideas and that he, like the rest of us, needs to spend more time practicing communication with able people (non-scientist students and adults) and converting what he learns into written form.  Our behavioral and management sciences have much they already know that could significantly relieve problems and add immensely to well-being.  Accomplishing those prospective outcomes depends upon us scientists communicating what we know to audiences like those Kahneman is addressing in this book.   Read this book.  You'll find you've profited.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I'm used to reading on my Kindle 3 (Kindle Keyboard) which is incredibly light so the Kindle Fire seems much heavier by comparison.  I was looking for a case that would not add much weight to the device and this case works perfectly.  I love the material and definitely feel the device is better protected.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.  The Fire clicks securely into the case.  The front flap is able to fold back around completely and can be secured with the elastic for one handed reading or web browsing.  When I do this I barely even notice the case is on the device at all.  I have had no issues with the stand feature when used on a table or even placed beside me in bed.  That being said, I haven't used that feature when the surface was not completely level or on a plane but it seems very secure to me and I have no complaints about it.  For those on the fence, I definitely recommend this case.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Great new version of an old classic! Well done and more closely follows the books than the overdone Basil Rathbone movies.   I highly recommend the BBC Sherlock series if you want a present-day London twist.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Kindle Fire - This is your basic Solitaire game.  The graphics are nice, movement is smooth & I really have no complaints.  Gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I think it would be nice if something more happened when you win.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|I like R.E.M. and this is a good album but I would have added more tracks to it. They have some good songs and their most popular songs are on this album but it's short a few of their popular songs though but it does have a few that where big hits. If you like R.E.M. and don't want to but all their albums then this is the way to go.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Kindle Fire - This plays like the other Angry Birds games so of course I love it!  Gameplay is smooth on the Kindle Fire, too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its an ok game it has a lot of games but some of the games are kind of dumb but other than that it's pretty good
B000003CVX|5.0|I have enjoyed this CD overmuch since buying it a couple of years ago.  My former favorite on LP with Andrew Davis never made it to CD.  This is a suitable replacement and Previn and the Vienna under Telarc's recording management have created a stirring experience with the breadth and majesty this work deserves in the clarity and spatiality this CD reveals. I see the LSO label has issued an SACD of this with Haitink conducting, but after hearing his Bruckner 7th with the Chicago S.O., I'll pass and just keep right on enjoying this release.  Kudos to Previn and Telarc.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|Fantastic classic movie. Filled with the charm and class of another time. Grant at his most charming. Hepburn is a goddess who could teach volumes on dignity.  Someone should make the Kardashian sisters watch this.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I purchased a Kindle Fire for reading enjoyment and then I found this app. What a great way to get your study time organized. I love this app.
1416936386|5.0|I bought this as a gift...so I didn't read it, but my SIL who is 14 likes it.  It shipped quickly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the instructions are easy to understand and it's okay to kill a few minutes every so often...however it can drag a bit while accumulating points to unlock the next game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have this for the Kindle Fire. There are a couple options for variations of play and you can either tap once or drag cards to move. I can't see how this game could be better unless you need fancy background or card design options.
B000G2AHO6|5.0|The buy experience was sweet! The delivering date was acomplished by the seller, the condition of the item buyed and package were excellent and this shoes are simple the best! And of course the price is very well too. thanks from Venezuela to the guys from the Amazon  team for being that great store!
B006GG1KOC|1.0|my 4 year liked it when i played it with him and we guessed together, not so much playing on his own though
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great I love all the games. they are so much fun and there are so many of them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Started with a daily devotional plan, then used the audio version, added the daily reminder feature.  With the versions, and events I want all my friends to have this app. Makes the Bible easy to study.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game, awesome time killer. :~).  I don't. mind the ads, the game was free.  the games are simple, but can be challenging
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app because I can play with it when no one else wants to be around me, perfect for rainy days and lonely nights when you feel completely and utterly alone and you hear the sounds of all of your dreams shattering and burning.  Also helpful in passing the time while you wait for the inevitable death of your hopes and aspirations.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|This album reminds me of the heavier, grittier, straight up (maybe slightly updated) Megadeth I grew up with 20 years ago. This is a classic metal album..let me repeat that IT's A CLASSIC METAL ALBUM that could have easily been released back when I grew up with Megadeth which is why some of the younger kids may not enjoy it to the max, but people who were around during Megadeth's rise will very much appreciate it. The fact this sound has returned to Megadeth after many years has to be due to Ellefson's return to the band and I am thrilled!  Keep it coming. Good stuff. Rare these days.    EDIT: Powerline Magazine just named TH1RT3EN BEST METAL ALBUM OF 2011!  Haters hate..but I'm not the only one who agrees.    [...]
B0000VCZKM|5.0|After seeing Annie as a stage play with my girls, we really enjoyed the film version.  We loved Carol Burnett in it.  She is such a good comedian.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|not like the movie... way better! it is very sad.... i was nearly in tears at the end!  i reccomend it very much!
0060899220|3.0|The subtitle, Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly, is very apt.<br /><br />Bourdain makes frequent use of simile and metaphor in his writing. Like a junior high boy, however, all his comparisons refer to human excretory functions and sex acts.<br /><br />The book was strangely compelling, yet ultimately not my cuppa tea.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very nice quality back pack with great padding and nice smooth zippers that dont get stuck. And again VERY nice padding front, inside and back.<br /><br />my only complaint is that there are too many straps there is a neck strap and abdominal strap that clicks on for more a secure feel but sometimes it just takes too long to get all that on and off, and if you dont use it, it hangs loose swinging around. But security could be a good thing since you're carrying something that expensive and not exactly shock resistant.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has a little of something for everyone. its great. the only thing that I don't like about this game is how many points you have to get before toy unlock the next 12 games!
B004HZ76FQ|2.0|I liked it that much I finished the game. It has some bugs resulting in force close from time to time. My major concern is shaking the phone that fast the game demands can hurt the device.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are alot of different games to play kills time. should be easier to get points. really enjoy playing this app
B005P89EZO|5.0|I love this album!  It totally kicks butt!  Its not as funny as feel the steel in my opinion but its a lot more fun to play from a musical aspect of the album
0385535139|5.0|Another fantastic book by John Grisham!  I can't wait to see this one as a movie!  This has to be one of his better works!
B006JPS1OM|1.0|Cant get out of crime scene.  Even downloaded again still wont work.  looks like it would be a great game, very disappointed i cant get it to work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is the best. It has lots of versions. Easy to use. Audio as well as text. What's not to like?
0812992792|5.0|Adam Johnson brings together an orphan master's son from North Korea, an American woman rowing around the world, a senator from Texas, the most famous North Korean Actress and a Louisiana Catahoula Dog among  other characters for his brilliant book The Orphan Master's Son.  As I finished the book, I just sat and thought \\"wow, wow, wow!\\"<br /><br />There really is so much to think and talk about with this book.  On the one hand it is an action adventure story about a young North Korean man Jun Do whose name sounds much like the American John Doe, and on the other hand it is a beautiful love story.  On the one hand it is a story about nations and their relationships with their citizens and on the other it is a story about families and their bonds of love and loyalty.  On the one hand it is a morality tale about the lies and propaganda  which nations  tell their citizens and on the other it is a novel about the truth that lives between people.<br /><br />Johnson's vision of North Korea is indeed frightening a dystopian society, where all is dictated by the Supreme Leader, one in which people are starved, tortured and sent to prison.  It is a nation in which the citizen's only value is to serve the Supreme Leader, where his picture rests in an important place in every house, dwelling and place of employment.  It is a nation in which the loudspeaker sends out propaganda proclamations to its citizens on a daily basis.<br /><br />Jun Do the young man raised in the orphanage, serves the Supreme Leader as do all citizens, he serves in the military digging tunnels, kidnapping people from Japan and listening to radio transmissions.  he is a man willing to move where commanded.  But Johnson, has gifted this underdog with an inner goodness, so the reader cannot help but pull for him.  It is enlightening to observe his transformations.<br /><br />Johnson's writing is wonderful, he changes his voice with perspectives, whether it is from the loudspeaker's, a biographer (a specialized torturer) or Jun Do's.  Here is a bit from Jun Do's:<br /><br />\\"In Prison 33, little by little, you relinquished everything, starting with your tomorrows and all that might be.  Next went your past, and suddenly it was inconceivable that your head had ever touched a pillow, that you'd once used a spoon or a toilet, that your mouth had once known flavors and your eyes had beheld colors beyond gray and brown and the shade of black that bold took on.  Before you relinquished yourself --Ga had felt it starting, like the numb of cold limbs--you let go of all the others, each person you'd once known.  They became ideas then notions then impressions then they were as ghostly as projections against a prison infirmary.\\"<br /><br />The one thing which may throw some readers off is that while the first half of the book is told from Jun Do's perspective the second half shifts through four perspectives, changing at each chapter.  I enjoy a book with shifting perspectives, but the first time it happens in this book it is slightly unsettling.<br /><br />I found this book to be extremely powerful and I truly would tell anyone \\"you must read this.\\"it from Jun Do's:  \\"In Prison 33, little by little, you relinquished everything, starting with your tomorrows and all that might be.

B0065GC0PG|5.0|\\"Imagine there was a cure, but finding it would cost you everything. It would completely ruin your life. What would you do?\\"<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Un-freaking-believable (in a great way!). The awesomeness of Cinder cannot be explained by my words. You have to read it to love it! At first, I thought it's probably Cinderella with a twist, which it is. Only it's not so much as just Cinderella but also a bit of Snow White and Beauty & The Beast set in an amazing world. Oh, add some sci-fi to the mix too!<br /><br />Cinder's a mechanic, the best in New Beijing, and also a cyborg. In a dystopian world hit by a plague for which no cure exists yet, cyborgs aren't treated with much respect. Complete with a swoon-worthy prince, an evil queen and a girl (or in this case, cyborg) who's a surviver , Cinder's the beginning of a modern fairy tale!<br /><br />There's nothing I can tell you about the plot that isn't already mentioned in the blurb without giving you spoilers. All I can say is, Marissa Meyer's debut novel is absolutely FANTASTIC and any YA/Dystopian/Sci-Fi fan would absolutely love this! It had me hooked, that's for sure!<br /><br />The end of the book left me wanting more. Really, I want Lunar Chronicles #2 and I want it now! Argh! I have to wait a WHOLE year! When you finish reading Cinder, you'd feel the same way, believe me, I know.<br /><br />This isn't one to miss. Just buy it.<br /><br />Oh also, I'm a little in love with Kai. ' ' '<br /><br />\\"He was the fantasy of every girl in the country. He was so far out of realm, her world, that she should have stopped thinking about him the second the door had closed. Should stop thinking about him immediately. Should never think about him again, except maybe as a client - and her prince.<br /><br />And yet, the memory of his fingers against her skin refused to fade.\\"
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not a bad game, glad it was a free one. enjoy playing it, would recommend to everyone. thanks enjoy while its free
B004L03B3S|5.0|A beautifully filmed movie that depicts an likely set of lovers, which  opens up a field of controversial discussion. Anyone who views this particular movie would hold their own individual comments. On the downside, I feel that it could have contained a little more complexity given the film's rather basic, linear storyline.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is very addicting. it is so accolade. I would very highly recommend it. for being free and all u would think it goes down the toilet but it doesn't.5 stars here
B004ZZLX5W|5.0|This was an album that I decided to buy after listening to \\"The Suburbs\\" and \\"The Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains.)\\"  I didn't know if I would like the entire album or if it would be worth the few extra bucks for the extra tracks and DVD. I was delighted to find that I love this album more every time I listen to it.  Each song is both a work in itself as well as a piece of the larger picture that \\"The Suburbs\\" paints.  This is my first Arcade Fire album, but it won't be the last.  This album moves me in ways I haven't been moved before, and I hope that as I continue to explore Arcade Fire's discography that I will continue to experience this.  The film \\"The Suburbs\\" adds to the mood of the suburbs and gives the viewer a greater feel for the album.  Not the best film because it leaves so much up to the viewer, but it is still very interesting and was made to be a piece of art the same way that Arcade Fire's music is.    I would recommend this album to my family and friends.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I don't purchase too many movies on DVD, but after seeing Horrible Bosses in the theater I wanted to be able to watch this again and again (and I have)!   Everyone's tastes are different so it is impossible to say what I like is good for everyone.  If you are a fan of Jason Sudeikis (SNL) or Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), or want to see Jennifer Aniston in a surprising \\"naughty girl\\" role, then check this out.  The movie has 3 different story lines that are pulled together by the main male characters (Jason Bateman, Sudeikis, Day).  Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx are great in their roles, and Donald Sutherland and Julie Bowen (Modern Family) have parts in the movie as well.  What I still can't get over is the character that Jennifer Aniston plays- she looks amazing and her dentist portrayal is one that is like no other role she has done before!  This is a hilarious movie and I can watch it over and over and not get sick of it.  The humor is spread evenly throughout the movie and the story line is well thought out for a comedy.  Be forewarned, this isn't appropriate for kids and can be awkward if watching it with parents or people who you wouldn't normally discuss \\"adult themes\\" with, as the sexual references are pretty crude (but very funny)!    The DVD format looks great when using a regular DVD player when connected to an HD television, and has excellent quality when viewed with a blu-ray player.  A bonus is the ultraviolet digital copy that allows you to watch the movie on your computers and mobile devices!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun. But I do not like the pop ups after each game. But for right now I am going to keep the App.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I purchased this DVD from Amazon and Amazing Dealz. It was a Christmas gift for my nephew and he loved it. It was carefully packaged and arrived on time. I didn't know that at first since it came packaged with a gift for my niece! We didn't find out (and I'd assumed the DVD didn't get shipped on time) until she started cutting through the packaging/tape and there it was! We all got a laugh out of it anyway.<br />Thanks for the prompt accurate service!
B0055SWM08|5.0|a nice challenging game with soothing music and nice graphics. have played both versions and am addicted to the game.
0312641893|5.0|My preconceived notion going into this book was the main character, Cinder, would be comparable to Cinderella. I honestly was a little apprehensive when I (mistakenly) assumed this would be some science fiction rehash of the same old fairy tale. The author, however, has created a character that lives and breathes, one you feel for as she goes about her day at the very bottom of a society which judges her for being cyborg. At no point during my reading did I feel like \\"Cinder\\" was just another version of \\"Cinderella.\\" It feels like the author used the fairy tale as a jumping-off point more than as anything else.  The book opens on a market scene complete with the smell of cinnamon buns and people careful to keep their distance from Cinder and her android repair booth. We get a glimpse into Cinder's everyday life, as well as a look at how the society of New Beijing goes about a typical day where people are dying left and right. The culprit is a plague blamed on the Lunars, an alien race now living on the moon. Cinder's voice is clear and distinct from the moment she notices others' wary glances when she yanks her foot off, to the end of the novel. A chance run-in with Prince Kai, who's in hiding, gives way to a plague victim and medbots. People in the market square close up shop quickly, and with this event ending the first chapter, I was convinced I was in for one memorable trip.  Let's look at the originality: Cyborgs living during a plague that's wiping out New Beijing after the fourth World War. Do you know the craziest part about that premise? With the way debut author Marissa Meyer writes, I buy it. I think readers will appreciate the creativity splashed across each page. Small details help readers smell the market, the grease hovering over Cinder's booth, and much more. The quarantined area is simple, but effective; the writing here is tight. Throughout my reading, I found myself wishing I could write like this woman. Meyer injects fantasy with a unique jolt ofgood writing that kept my attention. Of course, so did the Lunars who were suddenly threatening to launch the first war since world peace.  Iko, Cinder's trusty sidekick, is the maid of the house, and her personality alone (data on a computer chip) made me smile more than once while reading this. Prince Kai, while a little annoyingly perfect and predictable for this kind of science fiction romance (looks like a million bucks, has a temper, yet maintains a heart of gold), was at least believable as the heir apparent to New Beijing's throne. Queen Levana, a Lunar, is an intriguing villain. I found myself wanting to know more about the Lunar people, but I understand the author's need to stretch the story out over the course of the planned four books in this new series.  Each character acted in ways consistent with their personalities. It never felt like the author was positioning them where she wanted them just to make the plot work. The story seemed to advance based on character action and reaction, and nothing felt forced. Granted, the characters are somehow going to end up at the ball, but the twists and turns you take along the way make this well worth the ride.  Realistic dialogue is where this story really pulled me in. I appreciated the fact the androids and cyborgs spoke no differently than any human New Beijing citizens. The same goes for the Lunars.  I barely thought about the pacing. I found myself wanting to return to the book time and again, just to spend more time in Cinder's world. Cinder is far and away the best character in this book; she is relatable, sympathetic, and very easy to root for. Despite the rust adorning part of her body, she shines. The pace felt measured and even. At no point did I feel like giving up on the book, and I never felt like the story was moving too quickly.  Believe it or not, the ending provided me with a final twist I did not see coming. The events immediately following the ball really got me excited for the next book. A cliffhanger ending is inevitable when you're dealing with the first book of a four-book series, but this first story was about identity, and Cinder, by the end, knows who she is. This means it's \\"go time\\"...next time.  This book is perfect for anyone who misses fairy tales or loves to root for the underdog. There's enough action to satisfy male readers who thrive on science fiction, with character development and carefully-paid attention to each character's nature. This creates real people who are more believable with every turn of the page (or tap of the screen). I will be reading the second book in \\"The Lunar Chronicles\\" as soon as I possibly can. What a treat.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Did I miss it ? Or is there no radar map? I am able to have it on my Iphone app, so why not in this app for Kindle ?
B006GG1KOC|5.0|three year old loves this This app he likes finding out what is different I like the fact that he can select until he gets the correct answer
B00275EHJG|5.0|It is a cute movie.  It continues the story until the boy is grown.It has some good lessons for kids.  I got the movie promptly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game to while away the hours. I really like the.sound effects and the ease of tapability :) Couldn't ask for more in a free game
B004O3YGMC|2.0|In short, this app is pretty neat but it has some breaking bugs. I'm running this on my Droid RAZR and while using this app it caused my touch screen to be unresponsive at all, even when I went back to my home screen it wasn't working. For a Droid RAZR that's a terrible bug because I'm unable to perform a battery pull.  Also when playing audio it occasionally will skip a couple seconds and you'll just hear silence.  Just glad I got this when it was the free app of the day otherwise I don't think its worth the price for an unpolished app.
B004Q8FTE4|3.0|Don't know, gave this as a gift. I guess the person I gave it to likes it since it was on his wish list.
B005OK721G|4.0|The last part of the movie was great.  The beginning chase scene was also fun to watch.  Yes, there were some parts of the movie that are ridiculous but overall it is a much much better movie than Cowboys and Aliens.  If you like Zoe you will love her in this movie.
B005TPCQ5I|3.0|I'm glad I just rented (for $0.99 here on Amazon) instead of buying. I love Anne Hathaway, and Jim Sturgess isn't bad to look at sometimes...they are both good actors and had great chemistry on screen. The rest of this review might be kind of a SPOILER, so read with caution. I know a main point to the movie is to see Jim's character, Dex, transform from a carefree, bed-hopping playboy to a tender, caring, more responsible adult deserving of Emma's love...I get that. I just feel like his low points in the story could have been drawn out longer and maybe made more complex. I think the skipping from year to year was all done a little too fast at times to properly display those low moments in his life that were so important for Dex to overcome so he could become who we see at the end of the story. Emma's story was kind of, well, really predictable and cliche, and, I felt bad for her during most of the movie...she seems to just be waiting around for Dex while we see her living her boring life. She seems to have things \\"happening\\" for her, but, secretly, she's still just waiting around for Dex. Most of the ending was predictable and sad and made me mad, too, because it was so bittersweet. It reminded me of the ending to City of Angels. I was entertained while watching, and I cried a little. It was nice to have a good cry. OK for a rental. Wouldn't pay more than $13 to buy it on bluray, though. Sorry if this review isn't helpful.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Save yourself time and money by not watching this movie.  It is one of the biggest POS movies I have ever seen in my life.  It is a terrible waste of having good actors in this movie.  Read up on other negative reviews to get an idea on just how terrible this dog is.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am up till all hours enjoying the wins. you just keep. going. Very fun! Great for kids learning their numbers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a really fun game. so far my fab would be the shooting spaceship one. one of the hardest game is the untie the knot.
0062101897|5.0|wow! this book is absolutely amazing!!  there is loads of facts and photos and drawings that are just wonderful for the harry potter fan.  the book is beautifully presented and is something that will be a keepsake forever for my daughter.  the cover is perfect as it captures the magical world of harry!!  so glad this was purchased.
0060873027|4.0|The writing style of Micro obviously isn't fully Crichton-esque, but the plot and scientific concepts are pure Crichton. The entire time I was reading Micro, I couldn't help but think of the general similarities to Jurassic Park: some of the first outsiders who are brought to a secret area with bleeding edge technology (no pun intended) find themselves in a land that is completely alien to them, despite the fact that they never left Earth. In both books, the predators are much larger than they are, and it's not entirely clear how to fend them off.<br /><br />As with Jurassic Park and other Crichton novels, Micro is a page-turner that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Richard Preston, while I wasn't as fond of his writing style, managed to keep the story going at a running pace from start to finish.<br /><br />There were a couple unanswered questions throughout the book (some of which were asked outright by the characters). And there were a couple instances toward the end of the book that, in my opinion, are begging for a sequel. Alas, we may never know what happens after this novel ends.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate this plot five stars. As I mentioned previously, I wasn't a huge fan of Preston's writing style, which is why I only gave Micro 4 stars. I would definitely recommend this book to any Michael Crichton fans though
B0054JZC6E|4.0|1 of my favorite game best game of my life awesome game of year see ya Nathan Torres :) $$$$$$$$$
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Love Love Love this movie! Can watch it over and over again. Must have for your BBC Collection! Even my husband will watch this one over and over again, but he does like BBC movies! :)
