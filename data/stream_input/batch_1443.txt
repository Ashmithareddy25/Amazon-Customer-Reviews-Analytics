B004EPZ00C|5.0|As I expected... If you're up for a crazy or kinda stupid stunts but delivers laughter, then you should watch it. I laughed a lot and been watching it over and over again.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|The second book in the trilogy deals with the aftermath from the games. The Capitol is not amused by Katniss's closing stunt in the arena. The danger that started in the arena was just the beginning. Katniss finds herself once again having to perform for the cameras with a threat hanging over her head if she should be fail to convince the districts that all is well.<br /><br />Collins seems to lose herself a little with this follow up novel. You get the sense that she changed her mind and altered the plot at a late part of the novel and it doesn't quite sit right somehow. The ending also felt a little rushed, stumbling and unconvincing.<br /><br />Despite the flaws I feel are present I've rated this highly because again Collins knows how grip the reader. Another very enjoyable page turner.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are fun.  I like them because they are kind of old school not a lot of thinking involved . just play and kill time.  good times
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games that will keep you occupied for hours. good for persons of any age. its like new age atari. wish new games didn't require so many point accumulation.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I'm sick to death of LOUD! movies.  I'm tired of special effects, guns blasting, cars crashing, NOISE!  I don't care at all for vampires, zombies, werewolves and other fantasy nonsense.  The Descendants is not that kind of movie.  It is a drama about real life in a paradise (Hawaii).  There is plenty of subtle (and overt) black humor.  I also liked the music in the movie.  George Clooney did a great job playing a regular sort of guy.  I think my favorite Clooney role.  Also a nice supporting cast.  There is a dysfunctional family, marital cheating, a wife in a coma, family business, selfishness etc.  This is modern life with all it's warts.  This is not Leave it to Beaver.  The main character in the end does not sell out and he and his two daughters have settled into a sort of truce.  There is peace and affection at the end, however, it will probably not last (real life).  A very entertaining drama.  Enjoy it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is awesome! it has never forced closed or made me mad . the things to draw aren't to easy or hard.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app because I am good at the games but to buy the games they're expensive but besides the cost the games are fun
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|In a world that is often cruel for no reason, Lisbeth Salander, for all of her quirks and because of her special abilities and attitudes is a breath of very fresh air.  The hornets may sting her but she never retreats, never gives up, never wavers from her goals.  Too often we quit before we are even well on the way, but not Lisbeth.  She defines proactive and energizes energy.  She reminds us that we can usually do much more than we think we can, be larger than we think we are, dig deeper than our usual scratchings carry us.  She is not stopped by bullets or her own fears or other people.  She is the dragon in her tattoo.  I assure you that when you have read the very last page you will be highly disappointed that the books is over.  You will want more.  How sad that Seieg Larsson left this world before he could give us more.  We will miss him for a very long time but will be very thankful for Lisbeth and her strong ally Mikael Blomkvist. Thanks to Amazon for making this volume and its companions so readily available.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this series and I am hoping the author adds to it--I would love to know more about this silo world.  I thought Mr. Howey created an interesting world inhabited by believable and likable people, at least most were likable.  As I have seen addressed in other reviews, it did strain my credibility that there was no elevator even for freight or VIPs.  I understand that the point of the citizens having to walk was to discourage interaction, but still.  (Maybe Mr. Howey can have Juliette install elevators in the next installation of the series??)  I wasn't clear on the relationship between Juliette and her father, but maybe I was reading too fast because overall this series is really good.  I plan to read more books by Hugh Howey.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game lots of fun... very very addictive cant put it down want to play play play all night long
B0052VUNHC|1.0|When I look for a new book to read, I often base my decision on the reviews of others, and I expected Beautiful Disaster to be an exceptionally good story based on all the positives. I was never so disappointed in my life! The plot is shallow, the characters are cardboard, and the dialogue is \\"he said, she said.\\" This roller coaster of \\"I can't live without you, I can't live with you\\" was interminable. If you like stories with immature and shallow characters, predictable plot lines, and poor dialogue, buy the book. If you're looking for more, look elsewhere.
B002Q63JEU|2.0|Great album, but I cant download \\"Ignorance\\" and \\"The Only Exception\\". It says \\"song's not available yet\\". Anyone experience the same thing?
0061122416|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation of a friend. After reading it, I must say this is one of my favorites. While the story is simple in nature, it provides many different lessons that one can take away and apply to their lives. It is a short book, so i found it to be a quick read, however, I had to really think about some of the concepts in order to get the meaning from the lesson. There are few books that I feel everyone should read, but this is definitely one of them, especially if you are looking for more in your life. Great Read!
B000UWO8XS|2.0|A great film ruined in this release.<br />This version is both pan and scan, which makes the  action feel more fake (some of the punches clearly miss in this version without the widescreen many of the effects are lost)<br />The characters voices and actual dialogue also suffer with the voice over.<br />The wait continues for the proper laserdisc version turned to dvd.<br />Selah.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I think this app is great and fun, yet it has some problams ... in my experiences it has frozen and right now it wont let me play the game.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|So disappointed.  As what most readers will say, the first three books were phenomenal.  I could not put the books down.  Now though with the last 2, and especially this one, I forced myself to finish.  It really feels like GRRM has lost interest in this series and that he is only writing now for a paycheck.  This book was mostly filler, just like the previous one.  GRRM would spend pages on how someone felt, look or just the scenery.  I am also getting a sense that he has no idea what to do with his characters anymore.  They just keep dieing.<br />  When the next nook comes out (whenever that may be), I will definitely wait to see what the reviews are prior to spending the money to buy it.  The series is so not worth the money as it currently stands.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|so awesome. from the start all I saw was mini samurai ownage then there was the militia farmers and the demon sword warriors I wouldn't be surprised to see the shogunate! !!
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I love this new series and cannot wait for the next season to start.  I think the two male leads work well and I think Donna is one of the best female roles in a long time.  I would love to see more of her.  I urge people to watch this entertaining series.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I absolutly love this app! its fun and addicting at the same time! I think its great as a free app and I don't mind the adds at all. although I proably wouldn't pay $2 for the regular app.......

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series was fantastic! I could not put it down once I started!! I recommend this book to anyone who loves action, adventure, and excitment. It will keep you wanting to know how it ends.
B002HK9IDQ|3.0|I was surprised that the DVD digital picture for \\"My Fair Lady\\" was not a full screen picture. It spoiled the setting for this happy and enjoyable story.<br />I was pleased, though, to see this DVD added a 'Special Features' which included among others:<br />  1.Audio Commentary<br />  2.Vintage Featurettes, Footage and  Audio.
B007857FOO|3.0|The outside with the fabric printed on it is just a big cover.<br />Inside the box is the dvd with the normal picture cover, the fabrik theme is not carried trough.<br />It also has an large prined fabric with the wedding picture.<br />I was disappointment that the dvd inside was notting special considering the price.
1846555248|2.0|While the author succeeded in some areas, she left me feeling empty in others.  She managed to create a magical world with rich imagery that you will remember long after reading the story.  The characters and plot, however, are quite forgettable.

1936891026|5.0|This book is required reading for all creative people. It wasn't what I was expecting-- Pressfield surprises us with a different take on creativity and Resistance.<br /><br />This was useful, informative, and inspirational. By telling us how war is constantly waged on our creativity by Resistance, the author explains what it is, and why it's always trying to keep us from doing what we are meant to do. Yes, we are in a war, and we lose most days.<br /><br />I feel much better about myself and how I approach my creative work. When I don't get something done, I don't berate myself for being lazy or slacking, I just know it's Resistance fighting to keep me that way. That gives me the urge to fight back, to create, to beat the Resistance for that day.<br /><br />And that's what it's all about. Do the work this day. Wake up tomorrow and figure how to get it done then, because Resistance will be waiting, always waiting, to ambush us with every dirty trick in the book.<br /><br />It's a lovely metaphor to explain our life and our work.
B001KMB6X2|4.0|This is on par with pitch black and he thrives in this stuff. The action alone is worth it, and is way better than Ghost Protocol.  The thing that caught my eye was the girls secret. A cool storyline for us sci fi freaks.

0307956350|2.0|I read the blurbs for The Expats and, expecting some fun, listened to the book on CD during a long trip.  What a let down. I had to hear all the bad writing and silly plot elements that I might have overlooked had I been reading and able to skim.  The main character, Kate, is former CIA, now a trailing spouse with a husband working in Luxembourg.  She's the only CIA agent you ever heard of who, when surprised, stands there with her mouth hanging open.  And when she tries to close it, she can't.  She's THAT surprised!<br /><br />Kate never told her husband, Dexter, about her CIA job, and for plot reasons she contemplates telling him now.  But she figures, genius that she is, that if she tells him the basic fact of her former profession, she will have to tell him every tiny detail of her work, including an harrowing event she prefers to keep secret.  Really?  She can't imagine giving an outline of her days as an operative, then claiming the rest is classified?  This is the clever CIA spook?<br /><br />Kate also gives newcomers in her life open access in many ways that we yokels who never held a government clearance find strangely naive.  Could our country really count on such simpletons?<br /><br />The book was twice as long as it should have been, stuffed with filler such as \\"she grabbed the mouse and moved the cursor\\".  I don't believe anything I've read has droned through that level of detail!  Descriptions were terrible, such as \\"he had the skin of an old Shar Pei\\".  As if the skin of a young Shar Pei was smooth!<br /><br />The reader of the CD version, Mozhan Marno, was no help.  She narrated the voice of all male characters in the same monotonous, low register, making every man sound identically stilted and robotic.  And though her French accent was lovely, she mispronounced such words as trattoria, rifled, Copenhagen, and eschew.  (I am currently listening to Mark Twain: A Life by Ron Powers, read by the author.  The contrast is striking.  Powers has the addedproblem of letting you know when he's quoting.  He shifts his voice slightly, and uses a countried accent for Twain, so its always clear.  Perhaps he should teach a class.)<br /><br />The excellent blurbs quoted above show that connections are all, when it comes to publicity.  Chris Pavone, a former editor with contacts in the book biz, has been given praise by his friends in spite of his mediocre writing.
B005C5A6C0|2.0|Basically all the stuff you've come to expect out of this band since their early days and the days after their hilarious embarrassment \\"Supercharger\\".  Generic, simplistic riffs followed by buzz saw sounds that have been played a lot by radio rock and metal since 2001, slow paced music for the sake, little to nothing special, and as always, trend hopping.<br /><br />Well, there is some occasions where they toss a curve ball at you such as picking up the pace to thrash territory or play some neat leads, most noticeably in \\"Be Still and Know\\", that are par with Vio-Lence energetic thrash and Robb Flynn's vocals are pretty good (at least when he's not trying to use it over and over again for a minute), but overall there doesn't seem to be a great sense of passion in this music and to make things worse, MH actually stretch some of these songs out for six to a painful eight minutes long.  Why is this even necessary when they could have just left them at three or four minutes and in turn make it somewhat better?  I guess they need to fill up some space to reach studio album length.<br /><br />Once again, still underwhelming, still out dated, and not even close to Vio-Lence's first two albums, despite Phil Demmel's presence here and some fast pace thrash here and there.  It'll probably be excellent for the people who still cling to mainstream radio often but if you really want to get your hands on something challenging today, get something from Ulcerate or Mitochondrion but if you want something really unique yet accessible, check out Sigh's new album \\"In Somniphobia\\".  Otherwise, just get Prong's new album, at least Prong still writes groove metal with a good mount of the energetic passion of their early days.  Whichever one you pick, you'll put this cotton gin of an album away in the shelf for good, or better yet, you'll throw it away or bury it in your yard so that you can save room for more albums that may be worth your time and with your help, you can finally put an end to Robb Flynn's trend hopping ways so that he may actually try to write something inspired, interesting, and maybe even something (gasp) unique!<br /><br />4/10nd to Robb Flynn's trend hopping ways so that he may actually try to write something inspired, interesting, and maybe even something (gasp) unique!<br /><br />4/10
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was one of the greatest books I have read in a long time... great story..page turner.. .was not able to put it down.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Fun game..addicting, but MAJOR glitches in regeneration times. I put a lot of time and some real cash into this game and then all of my business, houses, crops, etc., were up to 150+ hours. Plus, every time I go to play, my energy is completely depleted. I have sent numerous complaints to gameloft support and have yet to get a reply. It's been a week. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME. It will only frustrate you.

B0055SWM08|5.0|you can play at your own speed and its a clever but attainable game.  very creative.  fun times and rewarding little sounds.
B007IX383I|4.0|I only recently started listening to this band, and their early material is indeed quite different than what they are now doing.  Listening to their early work and comparing it with what they are doing now, I think it's all good... but throughout their history, one can see a progression of personal and spiritual growth as well as an artistic development that nowadays shows their willingness to try new things and connect with the softer aspects of being human.  The people in this band are truly gifted in that respect.<br /><br />Thus, when taking Anathema's more recent work on its own merit, I find they are producing masterpieces when it comes to arranging and performing.  The lyrical content may be too sentimental for some, who may even find it corny at times.  There are some moments on \\"Weather Systems\\" where the sentiments expressed are universal, but seem to be ones expressed so often in lyrics that it's no longer easy to say the words in a creative way.  There are some rather tired-sounding rhymes, for sure, but there is lots of heart in them, courtesy of vocalists Lee Douglas and Vincent Cavanaugh.  In a couple of places they veer a bit close to pop-duet-ballad territory for my tastes, but they are gifted singers, well worth hearing.  They have a way of evoking both joy and sadness, sometimes simultaneously.<br /><br />For me, this music is like ear candy when it comes to its melodic nature and the high production values.  Full of crystalline instrumental passages, moments of turbulence and repetitively soothing spaces, \\"Weather Systems\\" provides a pool in which to immerse yourself. Give this album a few listens.  It might not make you want to get up and dance like some of their earlier music might have, but this is music with which you can relax and think.<br /><br />And I think it's pretty good!
B002VECLVO|4.0|From the very first shot the film A Single Man takes the viewer into a stylized world of beautiful pain, loneliness and searching.<br /><br />A Single Man, stars Colin Firth as George, a man who has recently lost his lover. In his suffering he is contemplating suicide and today may be the last the day of his life, indicated by the gun he keeps close by. In flashbacks the viewer is shown key moments from George's past that have led him to be the man he is today. On this day, the few people he speaks to are his lifelong friend Charley, played by Julianne Moore, and one of his male students, played by Nicholas Hoult. Both these characters, among others, help George come to new realizations about life and relations.<br /><br />Director Tom Ford takes the viewer on an aesthetic journey of Georges day. Ford beautifully visualizes the contemplation of ones last day and manages to translate how the weight of everyday actions and presences shifts in Georges eyes, who scrutinizes everything from a new angle. Every shot is perfectly composed, with color temperatures and camera angles chosen carefully to form a very layered whole. The styling throughout is impeccable, as are the set designs. The amount of detail and the artist's eye give the movie a surreal touch, making it more a relatable piece of art that resonates, than a heavy dramatic emotional journey.<br /><br />A Single Man is based on a novel written by Christopher Isherwood and is fashion designer Tom Ford's directorial debut. Though he did not design the costumes in this film, his touch is undeniably recognizable in practically every frame. A sense of style oozes constantly from the screen. Though the story is about a gay man and reference is made to being an unaccepted minority, homosexuality is never really an issue and just comes as a given. The story essentially revolves around human issues and journeys we may all go through.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|ok I had this app for a month or two and it is too quirky for me.  yes it plays videos, but naming and scrolling was a pain.  I finally went into my file manager to change the names of files but that did jot transfer over.  I also hated that it took soo oong to load on my tablet.  I understood that u had no choice with choosing cover art pics but at least make it user friendly.  Uninstalled today and trying something new.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was recommended this based off my interest in Old Mans War.  I really enjoyed this book as it seemed to touch on certain social and human issues that stirred up some thinking on my part.  The story was interesting and well paced.

B003XCVQ3C|1.0|This worked to deliver video and audio from a 2010 MacBook and a 2011 MacBook Air to our HDTV. However, it stopped working after a few months of regular use. I chose this over cheaper options because it was recommended by Apple and I figured it was worth the money to get a quality product. I was therefore disappointed and angry that it broke so quickly. It's expensive, but it is NOT a quality product. I will try a cheaper one now instead.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|great my son loves it; I love only four stars cause it sometimes hesitates. great game. we enjoy it very much.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|\\"The Hangover\\" was raucous and original.  The overwhelming positive response demanded a sequel but how do you keep it fresh?  I think director Todd Philips succeeded by making a continuation of the first film and not a cynical copy of it.  Plotwise there are similarities netween the two films but Philips gives some panache to the proceedings of the follow up.  By relocating the action to the locale of Thailand Philips imbues some exoticism to the ribaldry.  I laughed out loud consistently throughout the film.  Mike Tyson offers an amusing cameo and Ken Jeong as the flamboyant Chow practically steals the show.  My wife liked the cigarette smoking monkey sporting a Rolling Stones jacket.  In conclusion I would like to address the film's critics who fault the film for being too much like the original by saying what did you expect?

B0078N2MTE|5.0|Well, Academy Awards around, in my opinion.  A great, great movie.<br /><br />Great story & Great Acting.  What more can you say.  Not the typical mushy, sickening drama that makes you want to blow your head off out of boredom, and - yet -surprisingly down to earth and \\"normal\\" for a movie so interesting.

B0034G4ORM|4.0|I watched \\"Battle For Los Angeles\\" and it was the worst!  Straight to dvd wasn't enough to save this movie!  \\"Battle:Los Angeles\\" was entertaining and actually provided battle sequences with aliens.  While not a thought provoking film it gives you the bang and boom for your buck...try to look past many of the cliches and just enjoy the ride...then tear it apart!

B005NPCUC8|5.0|This album is one of the best ever put together by the group, and it remains one of my all time favorites. I was introduced to Pink Floyd around middle-school, and I was instantly hooked by their sound and interesting lyrics. Nothing really compares to their music even now. Today's music, empty-headed, shallow, and devoid of originality and meaning, will never stand the test of time.

0439023521|5.0|I followed an usual path to reading, \\"The Hunger Games\\" instead of reading the book and then watching the movie... I did the opposite and watched the movie first. Despite being a little too violent for my tastes (at least for movies) I thought its was a very interesting twist on stories like Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\". I decided that it might be fun to go ahead and read the trilogy.<br /><br />The biggest complaint that I heard about Suzanne Collins' writing, was her writing. People complain that the dialogue is overly contrived and that the writing lacked sophistication - violence was used as a substitute for character development... and such. After reading \\"Hunger Games\\" I find most of the criticism off-the-mark. While no one will confuse the writing in \\"Hunger Games\\" as a literary masterpiece - it certainly is better than some of the other books in this genre. It may be an unfair comparison but to me it reminded me of some of the works of Jules Verne (but with less foreshadowing and other literary devices).<br /><br />A few other notes<br /><br />- The book (except for maybe 5 pages at the end) seemed less violent and graphic than the movie<br /><br />- Probably appropriate for children 11 and up... since their are some scary imagery - and the concept (kids hunting and killing kids) is certainly adult. I would highly recommend that parents read the story PRIOR to their kids.<br /><br />- No foul language<br /><br />- Lots of references to being naked... which is a bit odd for YA novels- nothing sexual or even remotely explicit, but still a bit odd.<br /><br />- Very fast paced - the type of book that you will finish in less than a week.<br /><br />Final Verdict - \\"Hunger Games\\" is a fast-paced novel that will immediately engulf you into the anti-utopian future of North America. While the writing may not be world class it is good enough not to be a distraction. I would highly recommend it for a fun fast paced read - but parents - you may want to read it before your kids.<br /><br />5 Starse your kids.<br /><br />5 Stars
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Having seen the movie and loved it, I was eager to learn more about the story, which is often shortened and summarized in the movie version. I was not to be disappointed. The book provides a slightly different version of events and a more detailed account of the adventures of Katniss and co. You will come to understand things such as why Gale's name is in the bowl so many times and the relationship or lack of, between Katniss and Peter. Even though I knew the story, I enjoyed the book as much as, or even more than the movie.

B007R41E8O|4.0|I am a die-hard PC adventure gamer.  I was excited to see this game for my Kindle.  I did enjoy it but did find that the next place to go was not always logical.  I found myself running all over to see if a new interactive spot had opened up.  It may be because I could only play 30 mins at a time so I missed a thread for a clue.  But it was entertaining and had some decent puzzles so worth $.99!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|my friends all had this and now I can too. hurray. now they just need to put jetpack joyride and temple run on this store. also they should work on race Penguin or tiny wings!!!!! maybe also tiny tower
B0055SWM08|5.0|great puzzle game challenging entertainment unique and fun i even like the background music try it yourself you will like it
B004JHY8A8|3.0|I really liked the sound of the story, and it was a good story line, until I read a review that spoiled the whole book for me. I tried reading it anyway with no success. I got bored about forty pages in. I really thought I would love this book, but it just wasn't meant to be.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This app is the epitome of the type of \\"games\\"  that are  plaguing Apple's App store. Hopefully, Amazon Kindle users are smart enough not to be hustled by Gameloft and other con artists.<br /><br />This isn't a game; it's a get rich quick scheme. You pay for basic functionalty not additional content  or bonus features. There are no expansion packs. The quality of the graphics, audio and gameplay are reminiscent  the 90's PC games. However, at least you could continuously play those. Arcade games require more to continue. The more skilled you are the less you payed. People are paying more for these games than the cost of Halo, Mass Effect, InFamous and many other combined. This is the death of gaming...

B0036S4C6G|1.0|my wife recommended that book to me (after she read in a newspaper that this book is a \\"hit\\"); to be honest, I hardly could finish the book; some thoughts:<br />* coarse language (partly) - OK<br />* confusing \\"time jumps\\"<br />* not really thrilling<br />* I still have no clue what the book \\"really\\" is about<br /><br />-> no star from my side (though I am obligate to give at least one)
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the clean look of this game. You do need to close an ad before playing each game, which I find annoying but since it's free I can deal with it. For a few weeks a VERY annoying video ad started automatically at the beginning of each game. As long as that doesn't happen from here on out, I have only positive things to say about the game.
0345803507|3.0|I will agree that the sex is hot but I can't help wondering if this book was edited. There are misspellings, punctuation errors and the author clearly doesn't understand the vernacular of a 22 year old girl. There are so many inconsistencies with her speech pattern that it's as if 2 people wrote this book. Furthermore, while I get the fact that she wanted to sell more books, this isn't a soap opera. There was literally no end to this book, it just stopped. Not impressed. Sex sells and that's all this is.
1451627289|4.0|It had been years since I read a book by Stephen King. Intrigued by the premise of 11/22/63, and undaunted by the large tome (does Mr. King write any small books ?!?), I gave it a go.  I have to say, I was very happy I did. The characters were superbly drawn out and the story had enough forward momentum that you wanted to keep reading.  This is a book that is not a \\"fast read\\" in any sense of the word.  One has to hunker down and let yourself become absorbed by the story, letting it move you along at its pace.  The story can't be rushed so if you find yourself growing impatient at the beginning of the read, you might not make it all the way through to the end.<br /><br />Mr. King still is a master of his craft and continues to write stories that will take you along for a grand ride.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like how it Sucks you in and its fun.  it definitely keeps me and my best friend entertained for hours
B0072X2O66|5.0|With out a doubt this is the best album of 2012 thus far. This is probably Mike Portnoy's best work in quite some time.  He sound's rejuvenated. Sometimes I forget it's him playing.  The guitarist who I have never heard his work till this disk is absolutely amazing.  Russell Allen's screaming style singing is a little over the top for my taste.  But is  fitting for some songs.  He does sing his traditional vocal style through out the album which made his popularity on the early Symphony X albums. My opinion, those are the best songs on the disk. After a couple listens you will not find a filler track on the album.  Already looking forward to their next disk.
1594481938|4.0|Probably the most amusing book you'll ever read about 4 people who want to commit suicide. Sounds wrong, right?. Well Nick Hornby has a way with taking a serious and dark topic and turning on its ear. And even though A LONG WAY DOWN is at times laugh out loud funny; by no means does Hornby make a \\"joke\\" out of the seriousness of ones taking their own life.<br /><br />Written from 4 very different points of view (4 despondent souls of varying ages, sexes and classes); Hornby displays his talent for character development and dialog, giving the main characters Martin, Maureen, Jess and JJ each a voice unmistakably all their own. This motley crew of  would be London  jumpers each have a distinct story with background and reason for finding themselves on \\"the ledge\\"  of Toppers' House one New Year's Eve.<br /><br />A LONG WAY DOWN is a very human read that is emotional and intelligently told, while despite its obviously sad subject matter, is also sure to have you in stitches... but that's life for you, isn't it?...Life and a Hornby book :)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|A really fun and sexy movie with some excellent singing as well.  Lots of fun to watch.  I'm not generally a fan of musicals but this one was generally interesting enough to keep me watching.  If you liked it I also recommend this one:    [...]

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I thought the book was well written and held my interest from beginning to end. Great imagination and storytelling.  Makes you wonder, could this ever happen and do places like this really exist.  Very good book.
0439023521|2.0|I finally decided to read these because of all the hullabaloo, and I wanted to read the series before deciding whether or not to see the movie.<br />The book is so dark and ugly and morbid, I don't understand how anyone could write such a thing. To boot, that people rave over a book rampid with so much senseless killing is beyond me. This is also one of the first books in a long, long, time where I haven't liked the main character. Katniss is an unlikeable character -- she's pretty manipulative, and in some ways, rather dense. The only character I liked in this series was gentle character Peeta -- he was the reason I kept reading, despite all the ugliness in the book. That said, in later books, the author just kills my image of Peeta. So disappointing, this book and the others following. Far too dark to be wonderful. No way will I go see the movie.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|ok its a great game win VERY good graphics there are reports of to much memory, well the additional download goes to your internal memory NOT application memory. so if you undownload a book or to and some music it will work, same premise with all other gameloft games
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Every once in a while, when you read the first page of a book, you get a feeling - a feeing that happens just rarely enough for it to be special. It is the desire to devour the book and savour every page, to never close it. It is the sure knowledge that you are holding a new classic in your hands and it is the comforting thought that you will be reading it over and over again for years to come. Over the course of my life, I have experienced this feeling three times: in 2005, when I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, again in 2010 when I read Dan Brown's Angels and Demons, and now, when I read the first page of the Hunger Games.<br />Suzanne Collins has created a masterpiece, a work of art perfect in every way. The Hunger Games succeeds where Twilight fails - incorporating the theme of love subtly enough that it is recognised, but doesn't define the story.<br />The mark of a good book is that it, at times, makes you forget that you are reading it, and makes you think that you are in it, and The Hunger Games does just this. If you have not yet read The Hunger Games, I strongly urge you to. This is one of those books that won't be forgotten in a hurry.<br />Thank you, Suzanne Collins, and may the odds be ever in your favour!
1423113381|5.0|I love this book. It's amazing - some of Rick Riordan's best work. The journey is just amazing. I highly recommend this book to anyone above the age of ten.<br /><br />This book involves many deep topics - death, racism, loneliness, being different, pretending to feel something (such as happiness). For that, I don't suggest you read it if you're under 10 - and that's if your sturdy. The characters, the plotline, in this will have you in tears in more than one part. It's told in first person, and you really get a feeling of what the characters think and feel about what they're going through, and each other.<br /><br />Of course, it's not all serious. There are so many witty, humorous moments as well, making the story an even more exciting read. \\"You look like a cow that got hit by a shovel.\\" \\"Fine, Sadie, call me the Carter-headed-chicken!\\" \\"Men Ask For Directions (And Other Signs of the Apocalypse).\\"<br /><br />And the characters themselves are absolutely wonderful. Sadie is sarcastic and tough on the outside, but she's got a sweet, emotional side as well. And the part about her not caring about being different? I was so close to crying at that point in the story. She's also a very strong female character. Carter, her older brother, is very mature and bookish, which I absolutely adore. He's the target of racism, which, in my mind, makes him all the more lovable. And Amos and Julius are probably the best brotherly duo I have ever read about. Julius and Ruby are just so...you will be moved, count on that. And Zia, oh Zia. She's tough, but she's got her secrets. And she is also a very good role model, being very intelligent, logical, and doing what is best.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful book. It has everything a person could want - amazing characters, a gripping plot, meaningful moments, hilarity, mythology, and I think that people will be able to relate to some of the struggles the characters go through. A must-read on my list.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|John Carter was a great film which, unfortunately, suffered from the WORST marketing campaign I've ever seen. Everything from the boring, non-descriptive title to the confusing trailers basically told potential audiences that this film was a waste of time and money to go see... when the exact opposite is true. It's a fantastic and exciting film to watch, with great SFX, good acting and an exciting ending!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the landscape of Mars looks just like the Southwest desert of the United States. The filmmakers could at LEAST have done something to make the Mars landscape look more alien and exotic, rather than just an obvious set location used a thousand times over by various TV and film productions over the past 70 years.<br /><br />That aside, however, I'd give John Carter (of Mars) a 8.5 out of 10! Ignore the naysayers and watch the film for yourself! :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a well written series without sex or profanity that leaves young readers wanting more. I was captivated by the words and settings. The movie did no justice for these novels.

B005KR6OBM|4.0|Received the package very quickly. Only one disc out of the whole set had a scratch on them, so pretty good.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I bought this case after using an otterbox commuter first.  The case was great, and served me well for more than a year and a half (AT&T i4).  Unfortunately, it began to tear and crack.  (It had been through more than 20 drops without leaving a scratch on the phone)<br /><br />First, the screen protector.  I have a history of not being able to get these on without bubbles, and I HATE bubbles, so I inevitable took them all off within a few days. After applying this one I was able to get all of the bubbles off using the squeegee.  All in all, it took about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Then I put on the case.  It was much easier to put on than the commuter, though I kept feeling like it was going to scratch the phone while being put on.  (it didn't) This is just slightly thinner than the commuter.<br /><br />The case feels fantastic in the hand.  I have yet to drop it, but by the looks of it my phone will continue to be free from blemishes.<br /><br />I don't really see the obsession with leaving the Apple logo open, but it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />ONLY dislike:  The AmazonBasics logo on the back.  As snobbish as it sounds, it makes the case seem cheap when it really is a high quality case.<br /><br />This case is equal to the Otterbox in terms of quality and style, yet its a fraction of the price.<br /><br />Lastly, Amazon has the best customer service.<br /><br />I bought this case for $9, a steal.  A week later it was in the lightning deals at $6.  I called Amazon and they refunded me the $3 difference.

B004LWZW7E|4.0|Based on my liking of most of writer Andrew Niccol's films ([[ASIN:B000HEVZ6W Gattaca [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B001GMH8TM The Truman Show [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B0003JANCI The Terminal (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)]]), I decided to check out this film which seemed a bit like a rip-off of [[ASIN:B001JAFYFG Logan's Run [Blu-ray]]], albeit with a bit more detail thrown in. While not exactly the same as that 1976 sci-fi hit, I found \\"In Time\\" to be highly entertaining. Niccol has a way with writing sci-fi that draws in the audience, making his underdog characters likeable and weaving a generally intriguing story. The cast is stellar but it is the story here that stands out. I especially liked Niccol's metaphor with the usage of time in the film -- with time representing money and the manipulation and exploitation of this heavy demand put upon the general public in the film. For any fan of \\"Gattaca,\\" I'd definitely recommend this film. And if you haven't seen \\"Gattaca,\\" first of all, check it out; secondly, give this one a try on a night in.

B004SKIPXW|4.0|This is a over the top b movie with nick cage featuring his usual bad haircut. Nick , long hair looks bad on older guys bro! The movie was shot in 3d and looks great though. THe one star reviews have missed the point on this movie, it's pure silly fun and that's all it is. With nick cage busting out of hell to save his daughter from a evil cult leader. What were you expecting high cinema? no, you get a fun b movie that delivers lots of action in 3d. It's a beserk movie too with outrageous scenes like nick cage shooting people while he's having sex. If you don't like b movies then stay away from this one, but if you love good ole over the top b horror then sit back and drive angry. This is lowbrow drive in type of theater to be sure but I liked it. I also like high brow in my defense! The effects are great and this was shot in 3d , not processed in 3d so it looks better than alot of 3d movies out there.
0439023491|3.0|So after finishing the first book I quickly picked this one up and had to start reading!<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure what to expect, I mean the Hunger Games are over so what else is there to write about until the next round of tributes, right?  Well in the first book Katniss did mention that her and Peeta would have to go on the tour and visit all the districts so I figured we'd see that but other than that I didn't know what else the author could write about.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />So apparently the Capitol is VERY angry at Katniss for showing them up with the berries and threatening to do a double-suicide so there would be no winner for the Hunger Games.  I really didn't expect any big backlash over it other than the head Game-maker being replaced, well he was actually killed not just replaced.<br /><br />I mean what can they do to her?  She did win fair and square and then just refused to play by the Capitols rules when they told her and Peeta to kill each other.  So the President tells her that if she doesn't make her \\"relationship\\" with Peeta look real that he'll kill him, her family, his family, and Gale and everyone she cares about.  Okay you COULD do that to her or you could just not ever put her on camera again and let her fade into obscurity like many celebrities do after they decide they don't wanna be famous anymore.  Pauly Shore anyone?  Seriously, just how much of a control freak is President Snow that he can't let one little girl get the best of him?<br /><br />So apparently Katniss's little stunt with the berries caused all the other districts to start rebelling and the president blames Katniss and Peeta for it.  Really?  It's their fault?  Maybe the fact that you've MURDERED children for the past 75 years, kept the districts in poverty while the capitol wallowed in excess for decades, beat them for trying to feed their families, starving them to death, depriving them of much needed medical supplies, constantly lying to them, constantly manipulating them, think maybe THAT had something to do with their anger and their rebelling?  Think that might have been a contributing factor?  Just a little?  Nope, it's all Katniss's fault.<br /><br />See what's really wrong with the character of Katniss is the fact that she's a Mary Sue, she really has no character flaws, she doesn't think for herself, everyone from her mother to her stylist to her coach tells her what to do, how to act and what to think, and she just does it and once in a while we have some inner monologue about how much she hates the Capitol.  In the third act of the book we go back into the arena, we have the usual stuff happening, but it's pretty boring cuz we don't see much of the tributes fighting one another, it's just the Game-makers slaughtering them all one at a time.  Plus all this rebelling of the districts against the capitol is taking place where we can't see it, it's just vaguely mentioned by the other tributes and no one tells Katniss or us the readers about it.  We see that people in District 8 are rebelling when Katniss sees something on her Mayor's TV, and the other tributes mention it in training and that's really it until the VERY END of the book where the phantom \\"District 13\\" shows up and rescues the tributes and all the work of the rebellion has been done off screen.<br /><br />Okay so what exactly did Katniss contribute to the whole rebellion?  Well I guess she looked pretty for the cameras...<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />So my favorite part of this book was that the guy from the knot-tying station shows up again and he's impressed to see Katniss and glad that she used part of what he taught her in the arena to keep her alive.  Other than that the book is okay, nothing too awesome.  If you liked Hunger Games you should check it out but don't expect anything great other than a confused little girl doing what everyone tells her withlittle to no character motivation or initiative of her own.little to no character motivation or initiative of her own.

0345803485|1.0|I'm a guy. While I generally don't like stereotypes, guys and girls are wired up differently.<br /><br />This book is written by a girl. It is written FOR girls. And not all girls, just the ones that have no problem getting into a fictional story of sex and bondage coming out of the brain of one London housewife, with two years of free time to spend dreaming up this stuff, that in interviews, she says, she never thought would have any kind of life. The book is number 1 on Amazon as I write this, so I guess she was wrong.<br /><br />As a guy, I found this \\"white knight in shining armor\\" story so unbelievable, and so fabricated-sounding, I had trouble reading it for more than 15 minutes at a time.<br /><br />Little things may bother you too about the story....the people are supposed to be from the NW USA, but there are a few British slang terms thrown in that Americans would never say, making it even more difficult to get into.<br /><br />The real interesting story here, is how a chubby, middle aged U.K. housewife managed to hit the big time with this goofy junk. Bill Gates and Microsoft? No. Steve Jobs and Apple? Not exactly. E.L. James and girl porn, in a book. Uh, 3 books.<br /><br />About a third of the reviews here on Amazon are 1 star....as is mine. But we all bought the book. Ka-ching, Mrs. James.
B00753MBHA|5.0|\\"Stalingrad-Brothers in Death\\" is the brand new, 13th studio album by German-American heavy metal band \\"Accept\\", marking their second studio effort since their reformation. Building on the success of their previous/comeback album \\"Blood of the Nations\\", the line up of founders Wolf Hoffmann (g) and Peter Baltes (b) along with Herman Frank (g), Stefan Schwarzmann (d) and Mark Tornillo (v) reunite with renowned producer Andy Sneap for a second release in the new decade.<br /><br />It has to be clear that despite its title referencing the historical battle of Stalingrad during WWII, \\"Brothers in Death\\" is much more of a rebellious metal album rather than an epic/power metal work. In terms of performance, the double bass drum attack has been reduced substantially leaving room, in favor of more standardized heavy metal rhythm patents. This ties perfectly with the overall approach of \\"Stalingrand\\" which is prioritizes fist-pumping heavy metal anthems and at times straightforward hard rocking tunes rather than speeding tracks. Songs like \\"Hellfire\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Twist of Fate\\" and \\"Against the world\\" draw towards the band's late `70s-early `80s approach, naturally coated by state-of-the art contemporary production/mastering.<br /><br />Of course you will find the occasional speeding track, being the furious \\"The quick and the dead\\" though for its biggest part the new \\"Accept\\" album is based on the foundation of their first three albums. Overall \\"Stalingrad\\" has the potential to satisfy a wide range of metal fans coming from German heavy metal, NWOBHM, power metal or `80s metal in general. The new \\"Accept\\" is indeed here to stay!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Awful prose, awful dialogue. Characters without depth or conviction.<br />Annoying lead 'Anastasia' and 'Christian'. Even the near heroic scene falls flat.<br />For having gotten so much media-hype, this book is one of the worst I've read since 2009. I've read over 60 books in 2 yrs time; this author is definetly an amateur.<br /><br />In writing and in the genre, romantica.<br /><br />You can buy 4 better books, for the same price, as this one and its 2nd installment w/ the same theme.
B006OGMEWQ|4.0|German heavy/melodic/power metal group \\"Rage\\" are back with a brand new album, \\"21\\" marking their 21st studio effort since their formation in the early `80s. \\"21\\" is the third album to feature the line up of founder bassist/vocalist Peter Wagner, guitar virtuoso Victor Smolski and prodigal drummer Andre Hilgers.<br /><br />\\"21\\" could very well be marking a turning point in the band's career, artistically, being the first \\"Rage\\" album in over 15-year not to feature symphonic arrangements or orchestral complements on any song. Indeed \\"21\\" is a straightforward-as-it-gets heavy/melodic attack that takes no prisoners, of course it is bound to sound, at parts, as a simplification of the sound \\"Rage\\" have established over the past decade but still manages to retain their musical identity.<br /><br />It has to be addressed that though a solid metal offering, \\"21\\" is far from an ambitious creation in the contemporary metal scene (unlike the preceding albums which prioritized creative experimentation); that is not to say however that the new album fails to include a good amount of memorable tunes: \\"Feel my Pain\\", probably the release's most melodic moment features catchy passages and fierce shredding by master Smolski, equally enjoyable is the classic sounding \\"Forever Dead\\". Then there is the anthemic \\"Destiny\\" and the intriguing \\"Death Romantic\\".<br /><br />Overall \\"21\\" is a quality and relevant heavy metal album in 2012 and it could not have been any other way coming from a band like \\"Rage\\". Simply the objective of pushing one's creative boundaries, which topped their agenda for over a decade is now overruled. This is indeed \\"Rage\\" going back to the basics of European heavy/melodic metal.

B007FH9GT2|4.0|It could be a matter of personal taste, but this version is superior to the 2009 adaptation. Though they were very similar, this one felt much tighter and better acted. Daniel Craig was a better Mikael, and Rooney Mara was every bit as good as Noomie Capace as Lisbeth. Some might disagree, but all in all the chemistry between the two leads was much stronger I felt in this version. I am very much looking forward to the next 2 films.

My favorite thing about her book is the advice Heather gives you; she has specal \\"Things To Keep In Mind\\" in each sections.  The tips range from how to ice a cake, to how you introduce eggs to hot liquids.<br /><br />I highly recommend her book; you won't be disappointed.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|After reading all of the books as a kid and hearing this movie was coming out.  I had to reread the series to be reminded of all the awesome creatures and scenery.  The movie was great and brought the creatures and landscape to life. The plot was well done and the movie plot liberties were done very well and made it as enjoyable as the books.<br /><br />I found it crazy how it was not received well. As mentioned in other reviews, the marketing was not well done. My niece went to see it, she was not excited about going, but once it started she was hooked. The trailers and previews didn't do it justice she said. Probably never would have watched it, but now very glad she did.<br /><br />I have to have this one in my collection!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Fun game. Got to wave 26 then the game wouldn't start for me. YOU GUYS NEED TO UPDATE AND FIX THE PROBLEM.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|for finally making the Draw Something app for the Kindle Fire after everyone is done playing it. Horrible timing on a great app
1451683405|2.0|I agree with several earlier reviewers who pointed out the weaknesses in the argument. The author relies on two main points. First is a sketchy description of two experiments that suggest some decisions are made before conscious awareness of the decision. This is a fascinating area of research that shapes ideas of what free will is, if it exists at all. But this book does not describe the research in either the breadth or depth required for useful insight, it jumps to the wild overstatement that it will be possible to predict every action of a person before that person is aware of deciding to act. Not only is this unsupported by experiment, the author contradicts it later in the book. He claims conscious deliberations affect actions, therefore it will never be possible to predict all actions before the actor is aware of the decision to act.<br /><br />The second argument is a negative one, there is no clear statement of what free will is. If everything is determined by physical laws, it's hard to see much room for free will. I agree with the author that adding in randomness or supernatural causes doesn't change that. Free will has to be unpredictable from outside consciousness, but fully explained by decisions made inside consciousness. That's neither deterministic nor random, and we don't have a good theory for anything else.<br /><br />But it's a weak argument to jump from \\"no one understands it\\" to \\"it doesn't exist.\\" Physical determinism doesn't explain consciousness, and consciousness has to be the key to free will, since it is the conscious entity that believes it is free to choose. Moreover determinism just pushes the problem backward. If everything is predetermined, predetermined by what? We need to understand a lot more about the universe before we can assert that currently-known physical laws explain everything, including consciousness and existence, and admit only deterministic or random phenomena.<br /><br />What this book actually does is argue that the scope for free will is narrower than sometimes supposed. Decisions that we believe are conscious may have been made unconsciously, and decisions we make consciously may not be implemented. I don't know anyone who disagrees with these propositions, however.<br /><br />I found the amount of horrific violence in this book to be unpleasant. It opens with a multiple rape-murder and later references eye-gouging and senseless murders. Oddly, with the exception of one man hit by a baseball bat, all the victims are female, without exception all the perpetrators are male, and more than half of the perpetrators and victims are children. The book does not rise to the level of a slasher film, but it's hard to know what all this is doing is an essay on philosophy, except perhaps to distract from the weakness of the argument. There is some excuse for discussing crime, as attitudes toward free will could affect attitudes toward punishment. But in this case it is the rational crimes that are most important to discuss, embezzlement for example. That is where you are most likely to see the operation of free will, not in crimes by children or senseless crimes of extreme violence. The existence of free will does not rule out that some behavior is uncontrollable by conscious impulse.<br /><br />Another off-putting section is on political implications. The author accuses \\"conservatives\\" of attributing all results in life to personal effort, that heredity and luck have nothing to do with it. He does not name anyone who supports this view, and it's not even vaguely true. I could accept as an oversimplified view that liberals are likely to emphasize social conditions and luck as determinants of life outcomes, while conservatives are apt to focus on heredity and choices. If the author is correct and everything is predetermined, then liberals have to give up luck and conservatives have to give up choice.<br /><br />My final criticism is the author doesn't even attempt to be consistent with his argument. Much of the book makes no sense if he really doesn't believe in free will. \\"Getting behind our conscious thoughts and feelings can allow us to steer a more intelligent course through our lives,\\" presupposes a free will to \\"get behind\\" and \\"steer.\\" Adding \\"(while knowing, of course, that we are ultimately being steered),\\" makes it unintelligible. Who is steering us? Does it have free will? It might be more satisfying to believe we are steered by unconscious impulses than by conscious thoughts, but if there is no free will, how can this choice affect our steering? The concept of free will is embedded deeply in language. Any serious attempt to discuss it must be written carefully, this book is clearly not a serious attempt.s argument.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just loved these books.. I read them in four days. I wish there where more. The writing was hot and kept you wanting to keep reading
B00005R5G9|4.0|The product came on time and without any hassle. We had no problems watching it. It was just like I remembered from many years ago. The voice and sound track were out of sync, but didn't interfere with the storyline. Typical 1980s.<br />Sort of like watching a dubbed samurai movie.<br />Overall a fun movie for the whole family.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I love this package. The extras on the disc were worth it. A must for anyone who loves Harry Potter.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|This is great looking watch. I have owned two of them sequentially. They both became useless after about 2 years due to running fast by at least 30 minutes a day.<br />I bought the second one because I liked the looks so much and hoping the failure of the first one was a fluke.  A friend had the same issue.<br />The mechanical design is a nice retro feature, but it is not reliable beyond 2 years.

B004XKVPG6|1.0|To get it out of the way outright, David Fincher's 'Se7en' is a great movie that is head and shoulders above many that came out in 1995. The movie itself is one of my favorites (Top 10, at least), and one of the best \\"journey-to-hell\\" movies outside of 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Grey', and 'Valhalla Rising'. It stays with you in a way Hitchcock would be proud of both in terms of searing suspense and of course, in how little violence it actually depicts. The movie itself is as you can guess: 5 stars for me.<br /><br />Which brings me to the reason why, despite feeling bad for writing a 1-star review for one of my favorite movies, I MUST write this review: I am NOT getting the product I am ordering.<br /><br />Around a month ago, after having enough \\"spending money\\" saved to finally indulge getting the film, along with Fincher's excellent 'Fight Club', I bought the Blu Ray Book for the film. Whilst 'Fight Club' played tremendously well on my Blu Ray player, 'Se7en' didn't play well at all on 4 separate Blu Ray Players (An Insignia, a Samsung, a Panasonic, & a PS3 to be exact). Never could make it to the menu. The disc was corrupt. As such, I reported my issue to Amazon, and sent the disc back. Thankfully, I was refunded.<br /><br />Given the problems I read regarding the Blu Ray book release from other reviews here on Amazon, I stayed away from the Blu Ray book and went instead for a regular Blu Ray case release of the film. And, goddamnit (!), now I'm pissed. Yet again, I'm not receiving the product I paid for. First of all, let me give you the low-down on this disc.<br /><br />First of all, it is Canadian, not American. While that initial opening sentence may inspire a response of, \\"that's stupid\\" from a reader of this review, allow me to explain why that isn't good. While it may indeed play on my Blu Ray player, the Canadian release (in 2009) was done BEFORE the 4K Digital Scan and encoding that brought us Americans the (2010) Blu Ray book release. It simply means thepicture isn't up to par in terms of picture quality, and guess what? There's even more to it than that too. The disc is 1080i, not 1080p, and even worse, the presented aspect ratio is 1.78:1, not the promised 2.40:1 Amazon advertises, and hell, not the actual aspect ratio to the film AT ALL. Outside of noticing many instances of strong digital noise, loss of detail in shadows (in pretty much every dark scene), and such on the disc as it played, of course...<br /><br />Secondly, the sound only appears to be as good as the 2000 2-Disc DVD Release (which I own and watched for comparison purposes), so no significant upgrade there...<br /><br />Finally, no special features AT ALL. None of the 4 Commentaries. None of the Production Design mini-documentaries. Hell, not even a trailer...<br /><br />A craptastic release of one of my favorite films is what I receive as opposed to What I Ordered TWICE! Is that more than enough reason to give a 1-star review? To me, it is, because as opposed to getting what I ordered, I'm being insulted with 2 subpar releases I have to return...
B005LAIGLE|1.0|Boring.  I like Wahlberg - decent acting but this storyline was farfetched and extremely unrealistic... Wait till it streams for free on netflix.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|Never again will I be seduced by a film's cover. This 2D animated flick is a mismatched, generic little thing that's neither a satisfying story nor does it actually give us its main selling point - Iron Man. I'll elaborate.<br /><br />This film is called The Invincible Iron Man, but a more accurate title would be Iron Man vs the Elementals. Set in China for the most part, our hero Tony Stark has to stop four elemental spirits from collecting a set of rings before they raise an evil deity, the Mandarin. Gee, sound familiar, doesn't it? Meanwhile, he must also contend with S.H.I.E.L.D., who are after him on a false lead of weapons trading with the Chinese. Tony's first and foremost ambition is to save a woman who has an uncanny connection with the whole thing.<br /><br />The story of this movie is a generic mess that falls apart messily in the third act. It's a weird mishmash of Iron Man's origins (kidnapped by an organization and builds a suit to escape, this time when Iron Man ALREADY EXISTS!) with some supernatural jargon that Iron Man really feels awkward being in the same pot as. The most severe problem is the fact that Iron Man, as Iron Man, barely even appears. His classic red-and-gold armour? It appears in one scene only. That's right, the rest of the time he appears as prototype, grey or yellow Iron Man. Yet even they are very thriftily spared to the audience. This movie promises us Iron Man, then doesn't deliver.<br /><br />Not even the Mandarin can save things. A force to be reckoned with in the comics and Iron Man animated series, here he barely even appears and, to add insult to injury, is amazingly easy to defeat!<br /><br />The Invincible Iron Man is a poor, mismatched movie that looks especially sloppy and uninspired following the release of The Avengers (which, even though it is a live action movie of which Iron Man is only part, features twice as much Iron Man as this film does). Not even Iron Man's biggest fans can be guaranteed much here.

0143121006|5.0|This is a true crime novel about the upper middle class adopted daughter, Pamela Werner, of a ranking English Civil servant, Edward Theodore Chalmers Werner, who was found brutally murdered [organs removed from the body and all her ribs broken outward] on January 8, 1937 about a month before her 20th birthday.<br /><br />Supernatural spirits were first thought to have done it as the body was found in the Shadow of what was colloquially called the Fox Tower, thought to be inhabited by the spirits of foxes; it was actually a guard tower to the walled enclave of the foreign ligations of Peking.  The body was found in an area just outside of the walled city called the badlands and would be similar to what we would call the slums.<br /><br />The first two thirds of the book involves telling the story of both the Chinese head police detective involved in trying to solve this case, a Colonel Han Shik-cheng and his British counterpart, one Detective Chief Inspection, Richard Harry Dennis, especially assigned to assist Colonel Han as the murder involved a relative of ex-British Consul although the body was obviously found on Chinese soil.<br /><br />Along the way to the solution of the riddle surrounding the murder we are introduced to a real cast of characters as drunken cops, various thugs, several prostitution rings - the assorted pimps and madams, a shady but discrete nudist colony catering to those with eclectic sexual tastes, various warlords each trying to protect their respective turf, and the two main detectives who are hampered in their quest for answers, but for widely divergent reasons.<br /><br />It was thought for some time that the victim may have been mistaken for the wife of a communist leader hated by the regime of Chang Kai Shek, other avenues suggested the sordid sex rings, drug use, sex with her school master, and merely the wealthy foreigners' deviant sexual desires having gone one step too far on this particular night.  We learn of high level police pay offs, and too many other twists and turns to begin to list them all.<br /><br />But throughout the story the love of Pamela's father the ex-British consul never wavers and in his typical British bulldog determinism he pursues the evidence and spends all his money to track down the killers of his daughter.  But to not spoil the killer's identity and motive, I will let you read the story to find out the identity of the killer and why he/she or they did it.<br /><br />The story vividly describes the lifestyle of the ex-patriots of each of the foreign countries involved.  Depending on your desire to be like the rich and famous, you will either wish you could have been there or thoroughly detest it.  However, this is not a book you will want to put down until you find out who could have committed such an outrageous crime.y offs, and too many other twists and turns to begin to list them all.<br /><br />But throughout the story the love of Pamela's father the ex-British consul never wavers and in his typical British bulldog determinism he pursues the evidence and spends all his money to track down the killers of his daughter.

0446572993|4.0|The new protagonist is very interesting and grows as the plot advances. A professional assassin who couldn't fit in with society, he tries to assimilate himself into the \\"normal\\" world and comes across unfamiliar situations such as having a drink with a girl and being a foster parent to a rebellious, street-wise teen. The way he handles these situations is akin to watching a tough guy change baby diapers. Then in the critical moments, his professional skill set comes to life and he's definitely more sure of himself in those situations. A subtle dynamic that I found different from the other super-macho male protagonists in the action genre.<br /><br />The support characters are well-developed, so they are not just space-fillers. I ended up worried about how this person would feel when he/she discovered someone else was lying or being untruthful, how their relationship would be sustained, and what the consequences of their actions are. It's always good to have a bit of emotional attachment to the characters, I think.<br /><br />However, I will say this: long-time spy/assassin/action hero readers will hardly be surprised by the revelation of the ultimate bad guy. I'm not bragging when I say that I saw it coming about the third time the author mentioned it. May Baldacci threw it in there to reward keen readers?<br /><br />The ending was a bit of a downer. For all the build-up, I thought half a country would get blown up. Instead, it was more like a city block in terms of scale.<br /><br />Great plot that moves along, great characters that move it along, but with a less-than-perfect-for-me ending. Hope you guys like it!

What I didn't know was that written story line would be so different, in such an AMAZING way. I definitely have to say that the written story line is a much better one than the show (not to say the show is bad, the show is awesome and I love it). We can't book the novels down!

0345803485|5.0|Ok, After reading the reviews of this book I noticed a heap of people simply loved it and alot hated it. I think, it is one of those books that you just have to read to make up your own mind. There were a heap of things I hated about this book (detested even) but then why did I read it in one day . I could not put it down. I wanted Anastasia to dump Christian from the beginning. Who cares if he was good looking? I kept reading to see what would happen.  I have given it a five stars because it did engage me alot.  Be warned the sex scenes are explicit and a bit over the top. However, they are part of this whole world. Will I now read the next book? Yes I think I am going to have to. You need to make your own mind up about this book because the reviews are so different.

She weaves her love of all things artistic into beautifully choreographed recipes that promise to please the eye and the senses. I could almost smell the shortbread and gingerbread cookies as I read the step by step instructions that are so beautifully photographed. I have always loved to bake, but I never thought of myself as artistic. Heather Baird's book makes me believe that my kitchen can be my canvas.
0307957837|5.0|The books are great, and bear repeat readings through childhood and into adulthood, as the books appeal in some way to most ages. I have to say, however, that I really think reviewers should actually read books completely and thoroughly before opening their mouths or typing on the computer screen. The VAST majority of \\"plot holes\\" are easily cleared up if you don't skim while reading. For example, one I saw was a complaint about Lyra tricking the king of the bears when bears are un-trickable. First of all, she's the hero of the story, of course she's got to have some talent, and as it happens sneakiness is her's. Secondly, the author makes a HUGE point of how the king of the bears wants to be a human, and therefore trickable. Or that Mary was not the \\"snake\\" that tempted Lyra, or \\"Eve\\". Well, she was, and it was more obvious before it was OH YEAH, CENSORED BECAUSE IT SUGGESTED THAT GIRLS SOMETIMES HAVE FEELINGS OF LOVE AND ROMANCE (and it didn't even mention sex involving children once, thanks for freaking out everyone needlessly, skimmers). Also Mary gave them the \\"red fruit\\" that they shared when they realized they loved each other, but whatever, I digress. Nearly every plot hole I saw reviewed was due to poor reading on the part of the reviewer. I've read the books many times and know that it can be easy to miss things, so don't be nit-picky on your first reading. As for the anti-Christian nonsense, or saying that the author shouldn't write about Christian ideas because he's an atheist, I think that's just crazy. His ideas are based on symbolism and if you read it with and OPEN MIND you can see that those ideas can apply to many faith or non-faith concepts. As for not being allowed to write about something you don't personally believe in literally, well, I guess only schizophrenics should get to write fantasy then. Anyways, great fantasy with much to be gained at any age. My favorite series by virtue of the adventure, the wonderful characters, and later on in mylife the intricate symbolism gave me imagery to understand my own spiritual beliefs.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Starting off with characters who were already hopelessly dull and lifeless in Twilight, giving them more life in this cliche, totally \\"been there, done that\\" storyline is just too much. Nothing new here. Nothing fresh. And, the price? Unreasonable -- just like any other E BOOK out there priced over 6.99.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very thrilling story that makes you fly through the pages... I really loved this read and I couldn't get enough of the story!
B0076OV7F0|5.0|The most original creative music i have heard in a long, long, time. Once you hear and appreciate her voice, other female vocalists sound thin and screeching. Its hard to listen to others after Lana. She sings with such originality. Find other performances besides the album, and you'll hear different voice techniques that will blow you away. The music is very original, love the strings and sound-scape. The lyrics about how her feelings lyrically painted into her songs. The songs are written with such visual descriptions. Most female vocalists are cutting down men to elevate themselves while dressed as a whore. Not LANA, she is very real and confident. Check out her interview on NPR, you will develop appreciation for her intellect, talent, and enthusiasm. It is refreshing to hear such descriptive lyrics of her deep feelings in her relationships. Thank you for making a great album. I don't care what they say, all of her live performances I have seen on you tube are mesmerizing.<br />Music as beautiful as her name, Lana Del Rey! wow!

0345803485|5.0|Like many, I first heard about this book on the Today Show.  I immediately went to Amazon to read the reviews.  I tend to only read the poor ratings, not sure why.  This book is not about BDSM.  It is a love story, a soap opera.  It is not for traditionalist who have rules and limits to love making and passion.  If the kinky stuff is too deep enjoy the love story. Yes, there's alot of repetition in the language, but we're dealing with a young woman falling in love and losing her virginity. The dialog and her \\"inner goddess\\" seem very believeable to me. I'm sure many women can relate. One's first experience with sex is your only frame of reference until you gain more experience.  I'm reading book 2, can't put it down and just bought book 3.  Very anxious to see how the soap opera ends.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I loved this movie when my daughter was growing up. I just watched it again for the first time in many years, but enjoyed it as much as I did when I was younger!  The songs are wonderful, especially the voice of the plant.  Funny, fun, freaky, and just plain fantastic!

B005JE7WKI|5.0|I don't want to give away too much in the review but I'll say it's a great funny movie to watch. It's about a group of college kids who are extremely prejudiced against hilly billy folk and one kid pushes them all further down that road because of his family history. Then there is the hilly billy dudes who just seem to be in the wrong place all of the time.

B007A2O3FO|5.0|The war is almost over and 13-year-old Tolly (Alex Ethel) returns to his returns to his family's ancestral home that he barely remembers. There where he awaits his father's return from the war, his grandmother reunites him with his family history. He finds he is capable of going through time to help solve and maybe create important family history mysteries.<br /><br />We get to go along with the attorney and kibitz along the way. The story itself is fairly transparent and the solution is predictable; however the true value of the movie is the people interaction, the rich and intriguing environment, and possible lessons learned for all of us.<br /><br />This presentation is based on a children's novel &quot;The Chimneys of Green Knowe&quot;, by Lucy M. Boston.<br /><br />Julian Fellowes - Director is the Executive Producer and writer of most of the series of Downton Abbey; also the Titanic (TV mini-series) among other series'.<br /><br />I think I had more fun identifying the actors and where they were seen before. Many of them and even their characters turned up again in the Downton Abbey series. Many of the other actors appeared in decades of famous British movies.<br /><br />In any event this presentation is a keeper and worth re-watching periodically.

B0045HCJKS|3.0|A mildly interesting science fantasy adventure, Westworld (1973) features a futuristic amusement facility that experiences technical problems that turn deadly, as Yul Brynner plays a robotic cowboy that runs amok, and begins killing people.  The movie was written and directed by Michael Crichton (The Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, [[ASIN:6305495106 Congo]]), at the start of what would be a hugely prolific film career.<br /><br />In the future, there exists a vacation resort called Delos, where clients can engage in various fantasies, and pretend they are living in one of three notable pasts.  Westworld is set in the old American west, Medievalworld in medieval times, and Romanworld, back when Roman Empire was supreme.  John Blane (James Brolin) and his friend Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) are visiting Westworld, where a robot named Gunslinger (Brynner) is one of the featured attractions.  The pair arrive in a town, and begin their adventure, with Martin gunning down Gunslinger in a saloon, after which the men relax with robotic prostitutes.<br /><br />In the Delos control facility, the staff begin to notice various programming problems, and technical and mechanical glitches, within the operation of the various fantasy worlds.  Despite some corrective measures taken by the supervisor (Alan Oppenheimer), a massive breakdown eventually occurs, and control is lost, as some of the robots begin to kill the clients and staff.  Gunslinger goes into \\"Terminator\\" mode, and sets its sights on eliminating Peter Martin, who becomes the unlikely hero, battling what seems to be an unstoppable foe.<br /><br />For its day, Westworld probably provided some modest thrills.  At the tail end of his career, Yul Brynner ([[ASIN:B0011XF81G The Magnificent Seven]], [[ASIN:B0010YSDA4 Kings of the Sun]], The Double Man) was a well-known star with a reputation for playing tough guys.  Although a regular on the TV series Marcus Welby MD, James Brolin was able to make time to appear in the film, and does a good job.  Richard Benjamin was probably more familiar in comedic roles, but handles this straight dramatic role pretty well.  While the film version of Crichton's [[ASIN:B00008438U The Andromeda Strain]] (1971) was genuinely scary, Westworld is more amusing than frightening, although the action does pickup nicely at the finish.ilm, and does a good job.

B00005ATZT|5.0|Based on the classic TV series starring David Janssen, The Fugitive (1993) is one of those films that if you see it on cable, you are drawn to watch it, regardless of how many times you may have seen it before.  It's hard to say exactly why this may happen, but it is a film with some spectacular action scenes, which moves at a frenetic pace, where something is always happening.  The performances of superstars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, are other reasons, as is a story that somehow holds together remarkably well.  The screenplay incorporates a few key elements from the TV series, but widens the focus from just being about fugitive Richard Kimble (Ford), to also follow the activities of Deputy Marshall Sam Gerard (Jones), the man leading the team tracking Kimble.  Rather than just running away and hiding, Kimble is on a mission to discover the truth.  In total, it all makes for an extremely entertaining watch.<br /><br />Well versed in action films, The Fugitive is probably the high point of director Andrew Davis' career.  Prior to this, his most significant projects might have been the Chuck Norris film [[ASIN:B00004Y87N Code of Silence]] (1985), and Steven Seagal's [[ASIN:6304779089 Above the Law]] (1988), and [[ASIN:0790732238 Under Siege]] (1992).  The Fugitive is action packed, though without a lot of shootouts, fights, or car chases involving Kimble, who uses intelligence and some luck, to keep just ahead of the law.  Harrison Ford is perfect for this version of Richard Kimble, a man who is desperate and vulnerable, but also tough and extremely resourceful.  He gets a little help, but is mostly on his own, tracking down the one armed man, and eventually the person responsible for the death of his wife (Sela Ward).<br /><br />The leader of the investigative team, is a role commonly found in action films, but as Sam Gerard, Tommy Lee Jones has the persona and charisma to actually play a hardass supercop, without coming off as a completely pretentious and puffed up jerk.  Gerard operates at the front line with his team.  His first meeting with Kimble in a drainage pipe, is brief but memorable.  When Kimble says, \\"I didn't kill my wife\\", a cynical Gerard, focused only on the task at hand, replies \\"I don't care\\".  Gerard was apparently so popular, that the character returned, along with some of his staff, in the feature film [[ASIN:B001AS43VI U.S. Marshals]] (1998), pursuing yet another fugitive.<br /><br />No matter how many times you have seen it, The Fugitive still has great entertainment value.  The story could have shown more about Kimble's relationship with his wife and friends, as well as his trial, but in keeping things lean, we get to the chase that much sooner.  The ending is overdramatic and cartoonish, but after the long buildup, Kimble and Gerard's second meeting just had to be special.uffed up jerk.  Gerard operates at the front line with his team.

I dont not like how she set the book up though.. dividing it into three smaller books.. i do not really understand that. although this book is good, like i have said before twilight is my favorite book and movie in the saga, hands down.
B00757J98K|3.0|She's a living legend.  She's a smart lady.  She has always been able to stay relevant.  But with this album, she seems to be taking that last part a little too far.  Although there are some good songs, the album as a whole feels too contrived; she's trying too hard to fit in with the younger crowd.  Yes, Madonna, you can still be a strong, powerful, sexy woman at 53.  And no one should tell you to act your age.  But you shouldn't reinvent yourself as a follower of the masses.  You should be at the forefront of the genre you pioneered.  And to do that, you've got to be your own person.  Be Madonna.  Getting back to the album, some highlights are \\"Girl Gone Wild,\\" \\"I'm Addicted,\\" and \\"Superstars.\\"  But even they feel done before.  And not just by Madonna, but by every other female pop singer since.

0439023491|2.0|There's a thing that writers do when they're not sure if something will catch on. They will take the first book of whatever series they wish to write, and they make it stand alone. That way, if the book is not well recieved, they can walk away from it without any loose ends. Things will typically come to a close in such a way that there might be a glimmer of something beyond, but in case there isn't, things are pretty well wrapped up. This is what Suzanne Collins did with the first book in The Hunger Games. However, The Hunger Games came out just as Harry Potter was coming to a close, and a lot of the fanbase was looking for the next big thing to fill the empty void in their lives. Percy Jackson wasn't really hitting the spot, so The Hunger Games it was. The second book after that first standalone will usually end with a cliffhanger, or with clear intentions of continuing, and Catching Fire certainly follows that path.<br /><br />Catching Fire begins with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark trying to deal with the fame that their fake love has brought them, and the hatred it has incited in those that run Panem. They defied the Capitol with their very last breath and were spared to preserve the integrity of the Games. Now they are watched closely, and must keep up the act, though it is not much of an act on Peeta's part. To soothe the president, they agree to be married, but their act of rebellion has spread throughout the Districts and something so simple cannot put it out.<br /><br />Katniss makes plans to run when she finds two runaways in the woods heading for the destroyed District 13, saying that there is an underground rebellion there right under the capitol's nose. However, she is talked out of it. As the Capitol begins placing more and more pressure on the Districts she decides that the only course of action that she has now is open rebellion. However, just as this comes to her, it is announced that the next Hunger Games will be played by the winners of previous Games, and as the only female winner from her District, she is the Tribute.<br /><br />Copy and paste from my review of The Hunger Games for pretty much the rest of the book up to the ending. The only real difference between the two incarnations of the Games is that Katniss has allies this time around, and rather than a will to survive, she believes that the world needs Peeta more than it needs her. So she puts every effort into keeping him alive instead.<br /><br />As it turns out there was a plan to break the Tributes out of the Arena by rebels, which most of the Tributes besides the \\"Careers\\", and Katniss, and Peeta were savvy to. The force field keeping the arena closed is blasted away, and the rebels grab those they are able to. Katniss is rescued and taken to District 13. Peeta was recaptured. On top of that, District 12 has recieved the District 13 treatment for being the home of the girl who began the rebellions, and was completely destroyed.<br /><br />The good? Collins makes some very good use of foreshadowing, something that was lacking in the first book. She's very good at creating the extremely downtrodden and depressed atmosphere of District 12 as well. Again, the fact that the main protagonist, the one through whose eyes we see everything happen, is a girl is a major plus. See my Review of The Hunger Games for a detailed explanation why I think that is a plus.<br /><br />One thing that Collins does well is the effect of injuries and things like dehydration on people. Usually, you'll have someone get stabbed, or burned, or whatever in a book and they'll just brush it off. Collins definitely did her research on what all of these injuries do to people, and how it would affect their performance. It adds a bit more realism. And, of course there were no overly objectionable uses of Dues Ex Machina this time where the first book was rife with them. That is always a plus.<br /><br />I always enjoy a capable female character, because there are so many in fiction that are not. The world of fiction, mostly that written by men, but there have been some female contributers to the mess, would have us believe that women are far weaker than they really are. It is very good to see a strong female protagonist in any story to buck the norm.<br /><br />The bad? Honestly... This is just a retelling of the first book with more characters in it. And frankly, it was done better in that book. The Games are no longer shocking to us. However, Collins didn't realize this, and just gave us more of the same. To keep things interesting, something new has to happen. Something other than the introduction of new people. It's pretty much just the same old story.<br /><br />The action is still the weakest part of Collins' writing. It's almost as though every action scene, or every suspenseful moment is told in complete monotone. The tone and pacing never really changes. You don't FEEL any of the tension, or the horror of what's going on. It's just a bunch of things being described to you on a page with no emotion behind it driving things. Though I would like to say that there was improvement over the action in the first book, there wasn't. In fact, the action in this book was worse. On top of being almost boring, it's also confused. I'm not sure if Collins was trying to convey the confusion that Katniss is feeling, but a lot of the action sequences just don't make sense the way they're laid out. The entire climax is a confusing mess that really didn't accomplish much except make me pause from time to time and piece together what's going on. That is something a reader shouldn't have to do in a straight up action scene.<br /><br />This book should be retitled Missed Opportunites because it is so full of them. There are so many missed opportunities for character growth that are just passed by, as though Collins thought the characters already did all of their growing in the last book and didn't need any in this one. Katniss and Peeta are basically the exact same characters at the end that they were in the beginning. Nothing has changed in them. They haven't taken anything away from their ordeals. If you write a work of fiction, it does not matter what number that book may be in whatever series, the characters NEED to learn and grow as people during it. Something in them has to become better than it was at the beginning, and that did not happen in this book.<br /><br />The reasons given to Katniss over why she was not told of the plan to break her out are extremely weak. I realize that for the sake of the story there would have been zero to no suspense without a major overhaul of events had she known about it. However, the reason given is really weak and vague and doesn't much make sense. Come on Suzanne, you wrote a whole book that has millions of fans worldwide and THAT was the best you could come up with? What happened to your creativity? I mean, did you just put the first thought that came to you in there without realizing how lame it sounded?<br /><br />The Ugly? And of course, I have to bring up the writing style again. The more that I read it, the more I hate how these books are told in the present tense. It just grates on me. I find it highly distracting to my enjoyment. Typically writers get better with each book they put out. Collins seems to have gotten worse. Things that were minor annoyances in the first book have become huge technical issues in this one.<br /><br />In conclusion, Catching Fire did not really set me ablaze. It was basically just a clone of the first book with all of the shock factor over children fighting each other to the death removed. The plot twists were rather shallow and predictable, I saw the ending coming a mile away, and the action is written in such a way that it's both boring and confusing. The writing and story structure can be described as nothing but bad. It isn't a horrible book, and fans of the first will likely enjoy it just as much, I was just hoping for something more out of it and didn't get it. I have already read this book. It was called The Hunger Games, and it was better the first time. Because it is such a close copy of the first book amongst its other problems I'm giving this book two stars. This was not the best book I have ever read, and it certainly was not the worst. It was enjoyable enough for what it is, if a little more generic than the first in the series.the exact same characters at the end that they were in the beginning. Nothing has changed in them. They haven't taken anything away from their ordeals. If you write a work of fiction, it does not matter what number that book may be in whatever series, the characters NEED to learn and grow as people during it. Something in them has to become better than it was at the beginning, and that did not happen in this book.<br /><br />The reasons given to Katniss over why she was not told of the plan to break her out are extremely weak. I realize that for the sake of the story there would have been zero to no suspense without a major overhaul of events had she known about it. However, the reason given is really weak and vague and doesn't much make sense. Come on Suzanne, you wrote a whole book that has millions of fans worldwide and THAT was the best you could come up with? What happened to your creativity? I mean, did you just put the first thought that came to you in there without realizing how lame it sounded?<br /><br />The Ugly? And of course, I have to bring up the writing style again. The more that I read it, the more I hate how these books are told in the present tense. It just grates on me. I find it highly distracting to my enjoyment. Typically writers get better with each book they put out. Collins seems to have gotten worse. Things that were minor annoyances in the first book have become huge technical issues in this one.<br /><br />In conclusion, Catching Fire did not really set me ablaze.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it.. ive been playing for a short time and really enjoy the game.  I like graphics and the mini games and movies that come along with the game.
1451627289|5.0|...<br />...<br />...<br />*Dumbfounded*<br />...<br />...<br />...<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't think Stephen King was capable of writing a book this good. He has great imagination, but he is NOT a talented writer. Or at least I didn't think he was until I read this book. There are a few of his books that I really like, The Stand, and The Dark Tower being amongst them, but generally I tend to feel that Stephen King books make better movies. Why? For a few reasons, mostly his use of the Third Person Omnicient perspective really bugs me. His liberal use of the F bomb, and his graphic descriptions of sex also get to me. These things do not usually bother me, but when a book is 200k words long and 100k of them are the F word, you can see where I begin to get annoyed with it. And his use of sex can hardly ever be described as tasteful. His writing reminds me of a little boy who has learned a new curse word, or something he probably shouldn't know about sex and constantly goes around telling them to adults because he thinks their reactions to it are funny. He toned down both greatly in 11/22/63 and it was a much better book for it.<br /><br />King's books of late have gotten more than a little generic, and the quality of his writing, such as it is, has diminished quite a bit. A lot of his creativity seemed to flow out of him when he quit drinking, but it seems that he's finally found his stride, and his passion for telling stories again. You can tell by reading this book that he had a great deal of fun writing it, and it is written extraordinarily well.<br /><br />All right everyone. Grab your Stephen King preflight checklists and lets go over this thing.<br /><br />Takes place at least partly in Maine ... CHECK!<br />Protagonist is a writer ... CHECK!<br />Protagonist is, or is related to someone who is an alcoholic ... CHECK!<br />Vague, supernatural boogeyman lurking in the shadows ... CHECK!<br />Horror elements added to a story that is not of the horror genre ... CHECK!<br />References at least one of his other books ... CHECK!<br />Ties into the Dark Tower somehow ... CHECK!<br />Word plays become a major focus ... CHECK!<br />Inanimate objects personified as evil ... CHECK!<br /><br />Okay, I think we're ready to get this party started. Let's get to it.<br /><br />11/22/63 begins with Jake Epping, a 30-something recent divorcee school teacher. Jake is not a crying man. He feels sorrow, but rarely ever cries. However, when he asks the class of adults in his GED English class to write a paper about the day that changed their lives, he is moved to tears by the paper turned in by the school janitor Harry. It details the night his father murdered his entire family and maimed him.<br /><br />The owner of Jake's favorite burger joint calls him, needing to meet with him urgently. Jake finds him with one foot in the grave, dying to lung cancer, when he was just fine the night before. Al shows Jake a portal to 1957 in the back of his diner, and tells him of his quest to use it to stop the JFK assassination. However, he got sick before he could make absolutely certain that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, and wanted to pass the duty of stopping the assassination on to Jake, the closest friend he had.<br /><br />Needing proof that he could actually change the past, Jake remembers the Janitor and does a test run to save Harry's family from his father. Having succeeded he returns to find that it worked. During the months he spent in the 50s waiting to stop the grisly murders, Jake worked himself up to stopping the assassination, convincing himself that it was the right thing to do.<br /><br />So Jake sets out, back into the portal, to wait the 5 years until Oswald took those fateful shots, and stop the event that changed American History. He needed to be sure of Oswald acting alone, so he follow's the man's progress for years, bugging his apartments and following him around. Trying to see if there was any hint of a conspiracy.<br /><br />During this time he takes up work as a teacher in a small town, making great friends, changing the lives of the children, and falling in love with Sadie.<br /><br />As the event gets closer his dual lives as the man from the future trying to change the past and the schoolteacher begin to entangle, causing problems for both. And the past protects itself from changing, doing everything it can short of outright killing him to stop him from saving Kennedy's life.<br /><br />Getting the proof that he needs, he sets out to kill Oswald, but he is beaten within an inch of his life and loses his memory. During this time his friends, and Sadie discover that he is from the future and what his mission is. They help him to recover and regain his memory so that he can remember where the killing will take place, and who the killer is. When he finally remembers it is only days before the assassination.<br /><br />Everything comes down to the very last second, but he manages to stop the assassination, at the cost of Sadie's life.<br /><br />Returning to the future, he finds that a world in which Kennedy lived is a horrible place indeed. And because he made such a massive change to history, reality itself is literally tearing itself apart. He is told by a guardian of the portal that even the smallest change can tear the universe apart. He resets the future by going back to the past and effectively erasing everything he'd done in the past with thoughts of staying there this time to just live his life with a still living Sadie. However, he gets to thinking about that horrible future, and how much he would change by being with the one he loves, and decides that he must again return to the future, for the sake of everything, and close the portal up for good.<br /><br />The Good? As I said before, King pulled way back on his use of the F word, and the sex that was in this book was not graphic in the slightest bit. It was actually almost tastefully done, something I never expected from Stephen King. This book is written using the first person perspective, which is a VAST improvement over his typical third person omnicient.<br /><br />Jake is a great and sympathetic character that is wonderfully written. The story is very well paced and laid out, an Stephen King remains a master of suspense. He has always been very good at creating characters who are just average Joes, and crafting them into extraordinary heroes by the end of their journey and this book is no exception. The supporting cast is also very good and very realistic.<br /><br />Stephen King did his research. He did MASSIVE amounts of research for this book. He found everything from what sorts of cars people drove back in the late 50s/early 60s, to how people talked, to what sorts of no longer available food and soft drinks there were, to what people wore. He did a vast amount of research on the Kennedy assassination, and on the life of Lee Harvey Oswald. All of this research came together to make this book feel as though it really did take place in the time and place that it did.<br /><br />The character developement is spectacular. Jake goes not just on a journey to change the past and make the future a better place, but also to discover who he really is. He changes a great deal over the course of the book, learning from his mistakes and being strengthened by his experiences. Finally growing to the point that he is able to leave his happy future behind for the sake of the world. He's not a crying man, but he sure did cry over that. Character developement this deep and well thought out is extremely rare in fiction these days. Jake developes from a man who was somewhat emotionally damaged and selfish to the sort of guy who would give up his own happiness for the greater good.<br /><br />The first few pages of this book could be used to teach college writing classes. It is so perfectly crafted. The first paragraph is pure genius. It introduces Jake, introduces one of his defining character traits, and what it has done to his life, and gives the promise of a fantastical adventure yet to come all in a handful of sentances. Everything about it is designed to introduce the character and story, and to draw you into it. The rest of the book is written incredibly well, and you can feel how passionate Stephen King is on the subject matter through his writing.<br /><br />The bad? There are only two bad things I could possibly say about this book. The first is that it ties into a much older Stephen King book called It. And that book is referenced throughout almost the entire novel. People who have not read It may have a hard time with the way King keeps comparing everything evil that Jake finds in his path to Derry Maine, or wonder about why he keeps on trying to write a book that is basically his world's version of the book It.<br /><br />The second is that there are a few wayward F bombs that get dropped throughout the book, especially in the portions that happen in 2011. Most of the stuff in the past is pretty tame for language, but a few get dropped there too. Stephen King doesn't seem to realize that the majority of English speaking people in this world do not drop the F bomb 4 times per sentance. Even in this day and age, in the real world, not many people use the F word, even in extreme circumstances. Sure there are people that do swear quite prolifically, but in my experience they're pretty few and far between. This does take away from what is otherwise an excellent example of storytelling at its best.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is Stephen King at his absolute best. I am not what you would call a Stephen King fan, and I came at this book ready to hate it. I had almost already thought out a scathing review for it in my mind before I even started reading it. However, I have never read a book by him that was this good and well written. With 11/22/63 he has proven that he deserves his position as one of the world's most famous authors. This is definitely the best Stephen King book I have ever read, and it is certainly one of the better books to have come out in a very long time. 5 stars all the way. Honestly, I didn't think that Stephen King had this in him. I am most plesantly proven wrong. Great job, my man.<br /><br />I would recomend this book to anyone who is interested in the JFK assassination, Stephen King fans, anyone that enjoys science fiction, or anyone who just wants a great example of extraordinary writing.
B000A7DVR2|1.0|Rented this one via on-demand after hearing so many good things about this supposed cult favorite.  Wound up being bored by this forced, stoner movie.  Funny film if you are a middle-school boy or high.
0439023513|1.0|Suzanne, it's Eric. Hi, yeah, this isn't working out. I think we should see other people. You're in this downward spiral, and your writing just keeps getting worse and worse. You obviously haven't been taking your crazy pills and your addiction to the blood of the young is starting to get a little creepy. I just can't take it anymore. I'm going my separate way. Please don't call me again. You've still got plenty of fans, and millions of dollars to console yourself with, you'll be fine without me.<br /><br />Mockingjay begins with Katniss Everdeen recovering from wounds recieved in her second Hunger Games. She has been rescued but Peeta was not. She has been taken in by District 13 along with the other refugees from District 12. President Coin of District 13 wants her to become the symbol of the rebellion against the Capitol. Katniss is reluctant for god knows what reason, and proceeds to piss and moan about it for a good third of the book before agreeing to do it.<br /><br />The next third of the book consists of Katniss pissing and moaning while making propaganda videos for the rebellion.<br /><br />And the final third of the book consists of Katniss pissing and moaning while trying to sneak through the Capitol to kill President Snow. Along the way several throwaway characters die because of her stupidity, and she arrives at the president's residence just in time to do absolutely nothing to contribute. Somewhere in there President Coin manages to murder Prim, Katniss' younger sister.<br /><br />President Snow tells Katniss that Coin was the one that killed Prim, not him, and as she is supposed to be executing him for his crimes against humanity, she instead executes Coin and lives unhappily ever after in the remnants of District 12 with Peeta.<br /><br />The Good? Not much. More good use of foreshadowing. Collins continues to realisitcally describe the effects of injuries on her characters. There are a couple clever nods to writers I like to call the Fathers of Modern Science Fiction, namely Bradbury, Asimov, Dick, and a couple others. However, the references usually left me wishing that I was reading one of the much better books written by those authors. And, yeah, that's about it.<br /><br />The Bad? Every character in this book besides Katniss and Peeta are what I like to call throwaway characters. These are characters who have no personality, no motivation, no history, and no distictive character traits. They usually follow a stereotype and will have something told to us about them that is supposed to make us feel bad when they die. Their actions are usually confusing and vague, because they're not developed well enough for us to understand why they do or say the things that they do and say. These characters serve no purpose to the plot except to die and make the reader feel bad about it. The ENTIRE cast of this book is made of throwaway characters. There's no development for these characters. They serve no pupose whatsoever except to add padding and make you feel bad when they die, which, by the way, they fail to do because we barely know anything about them and frankly couldn't care less that they're dead. It is not sad when nameless, faceless cannon fodder dies.<br /><br />Peeta is brainwashed to hate, fear and wish to kill Katniss. It is clearly stated in the book several times that he will never be cured of this. And yet he just sort of gets better? When his plot serving illness has served its purpose to the plot it's just completely forgotten.<br /><br />The majority of the action, a bloody, gory rebellion, happens \\"off screen\\". Everything is seen through the eyes of Katniss, but she is not a participant in the majority of the rebellion. So all of the battles, the winning back of the Districts, the siege of the Capitol, everything, is not directly described to us. Most of the time we don't even hear about it second hand. If you're going to write a book that centers around overthrowing opression, AT LEAST INCLUDE SOME OF THE DAMN REBELLION IN YOUR BOOK!!! The action that we do see is, again, very bland and emotionless. Collins frankly sucks at writing action, which may be why the majority of it isn't even included in the book to begin with. When your weak point is writing action you do not have it happen elsewhere, you rework the story to have less external action and focus on politics, or inner turmoil or something else interesting that you're better at writing. You don't completely skip it and MAYBE mention that it happened off screen while the protagonist was doing something else.<br /><br />The Ugly? Katniss serves no purpose whatsoever to the plot of this book. You can remove her character completely and nothing would really change in it. She does nothing but whine and cry about how the world is so unfair and how she hates everything. Other people do all of the fighting. Other people do all of the planning. Other people do EVERYTHING. Katniss does NOTHING. The one time she actually does do something, hijacking her squad and using them to get to the president so she could murder him for vengeance, it turns out to have all been completely pointless except to fill up the last third of the book with something. She arrives at the president's mansion just as the other rebels do, and all of the sacrificed lives that got her there, including my personal favorite character in the series, were for nothing.<br /><br />You should not have to find something for your characters to do for the climax of your book. Your main protagonist should be the center of EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING should revolve around her. But it doesn't. She barely has anything to do with what's going on, and Collins basically made up a pointless diversion to throw her into for the ending, which ultimately didn't serve any purpose to anything. If your climax works whether or not the protagonist is in it, YOU NEED TO REWRITE YOUR ENTIRE DAMN BOOK!!! If your protagonist is not the most important character in your book YOU HAVE FAILED TO WRITE A BOOK!!! Go back and try again.<br /><br />Katniss' character has changed completely between books 2 and 3. She used to be strong and independant. Now all she does is whine and cry, piss and moan, and completely fail to make any sort of impact on the events happening in the story. I understand that she has been through a whole lot of horrible things, but this is the HERO of the story. This is the person that is supposed to overcome everything, defeat the bad guys, make the world a better place. This is the person that we, the readers, are supposed to most readily identify with, and want to be more like. However, she's a COMPLETELY unlikable crybaby here. The main character needs to be someone that the reader likes, connects with, and wants to root for. She needs to do something that is WORTH rooting for. Not someone they find annoying or unbearable. Yes, there can be powerful character developement in a protagonist dealing with severe psychological trauma, and I believe that was what Collins was going for here, but she failed so spectacularly at pulling it off. We don't sympathize with her. She doesn't deal with her problems, she spends the entire book running from them and crying about them, and she doesn't do anything at all to make them better.<br /><br />Even when Katniss kills president Coin it really doesn't seem to have much of an impact on anything at all. It's readily explained to us afterward that the assassination didn't really disrupt anything important. Katniss did not do one single thing in this book that had any effect on the outcome.<br /><br />I still absulutely loathe the writing style that Collins uses. I hate her substituting crying for proper character development. I hate her use of the present tense. I hate how nothing Katniss does is important to anything. I hate how Collins constantly has to explain her jokes to us because they don't make sense. If you have to explain a joke... IT'S NOT FUNNY!!! This book is horribly written. I'm talking like Dan Brown bad here. The Hunger Games books have gotten progressively worse rather than better. Writers are supposed to improve with age, not get worse.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book needed to be about a different character, because Katniss didn't participate enough in anything important for her to qualify as the main protagonist. The writing is beyond awful. The main protagonist can be removed without changing generally anything in the book. Most of the action happens \\"off screen\\". And a previously strong and independant character did nothing but cry and force everyone else around her to do everything important for her. You get one star Collins, and I vow I will never read another of your books. Your writing is AWFUL and I can do without it in my life. This book is horrifically bad and a complete insult to anyone who was a fan of the first two.
0345803485|1.0|THis is the most poorly written, terrible content, to the point of porno. Obviously publishers and agents have amazing powers of persuasion and the public are a bunch of sheep following along.  I bought this book on Kindle based on \\"Best Sellers\\" list.  I highly doubt now whether I will trust Kindle comments and ratings.  I have to admit I should have read customer reviews.  I would give this book a 5 star MINUS.  How can you possibly put a book on the shelf with so many \\"holy crap\\" words.
0439023521|3.0|What do you get when you mix Harry Potter with The Most Dangerous Game? You get the dystopian Hunger Games. This is a book that I have tried and failed to read three times in the past, and it was only seeing that there would be a movie coming out this year that spurred me to finally slog my way through it. It's really hard for me to lay a finger on the exact reason I didn't like this book at first. There were a lot of small nit-picky things that when taken separately are no big deal, but when added together they made it hard for me to get going. As a whole, the story and the characters are excellent, and quite enjoyable, it's really more the writing that put me off of it, and more the style than any real problems with inconsistancies or other such things that would make me start screaming bad writing.<br /><br />The Hunger Games tells the tale of those who live after the fall of America and the rise of Panem from its ashes. Panem consists of the capitol, and twelve districts, each producing a different item needed by the capitol. The people of these districts work as virtual slaves under thier harsh overlords, barely squeaking by in a miserable and starving existense. There was once a thirteenth district, but they were utterly destroyed by the capitol for rebellion, and to remind the other districts of the superiority of the capitol two children, called Tributes, are chosen from each district, one boy, one girl, to participate in the Hunger Games every year. The twenty-four Tributes will be prepped and trained and then dumped into an arena where they will fight to the death until only one remains. The games are televised throughout all of Panem and watching is required by everyone so that they know the price of rebellion.<br /><br />We follow Katniss Everdeen in first person perspective as her beloved, innocent and gentle younger sister Prim is chosen for the Games against all odds. Katniss immediately volunteers to take Prim's place to save her life, knowing that she will likely lose her own in the process. The boy chosen is one Peeta Mellark, who has the distiction of being the one boy on Earth that she owes her life to. She does not know if she can bring herself to kill him in repayment for his kindness toward her in the past, and hopes that someone else gets to him first so that she will not have to.<br /><br />The Tributes are prepared, trained, weighed, measured, and scored, then tossed into the arena where the fight begins. The Tributes are wittled away one by one until only Katniss and Peeta remain. Rather than one killing the other, they decide to take poison and die together in a final defiance to the capitol, but they are stopped and both declared winners so as not to ruin the games.<br /><br />The good? There were several things that Suzanne Collins did very right in this book. First of all--and I know this will probably sound a bit sexist--is that the main protagonist, the one whose eyes we see the entire story through, is a girl. Oh women CLAIM to understand men, and perhaps they do understand men slightly better than men understand them, HOWEVER the vast majority of women I have met, and whose books I have read don't have the first clue about how men are supposed to act, think and react. It's the same with men writing female characters. Don't think I'm just ripping on women here, in fact, men are FAR worse at it most of the time. In general I prefer the central figure in a story to share the same gender as the author, because a woman understands a woman better than a man, and a man understands a man better than a woman. The characters feel far more authentic that way. There's always something just a little off about female characters written by men, and male characters written by women, and when those characters are the one character the entire story revolves around the slight discrepencies in their behavior become huge, glaring chasms. Read The Demon King by Cinda Williams Chima for a PERFECT example of a female writer with no earthly clue how men are supposed to act, but still insists on her main protagonist being male for some unknown reason. Had this story been about Peeta rather than Katniss I believe that there would have probably been so much wrong with the character as to make the entire story completely unreadable. Keeping the focus on the female character with only very brief interactions with the male character spared us that. There are writers out there that can completely nail characters of the gender opposite to their own, but the vast majority of them struggle with it to the point that they simply resort to stereotyping.<br /><br />As the first book of a trilogy The Hunger Games does an excellent job of setting the stage. The history is laid out, the reason for the games, and other things of that nature are explained in an interesting way, though there are a few places where she resorts to infodumping rather than having the history lessons incorporated more solidly into the story. For the most part Collins understands that a character who has grown up with the Hunger Games all her life is not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to herself in her head for our benefit. Though there are some places where the info is just dumped on us, they are few and far between, and Collins uses memories and the interactions of the characters to paint the picture of the world for us most of the time.<br /><br />Collins takes an idea that is not altogether original and puts her own spin on it, making something that is old and tired interesting again. Katniss is a very well developed and likable character who has to deal with some very real and harsh dilemmas. Peeta is more of a stereotype, but in this story his character works pretty well. Using stereotypes is not an unforgivable sin, and a good writer can make a stereotype both likable and realistic. When stereotypes are used well they can make a story where the reader can only see the world through the eyes of a single character like this one feel much more real. Stereotypes are familliar, and when there isn't a lot of time and interaction between the characters to develop them fully using a stereotype helps the reader to identify more with the character. It is far better to use a stereotype than it is to leave a character vague, wooden and ambiguous.<br /><br />Though there were several uses of Dues Ex Machina in this story, the most glaring and abhorant one was merely a cruel trick, and at the time that it first showed up I was rather annoyed at it, as it removed the sole conflict that Katniss was dealing with. However, it was very powerful when it was taken back, so it worked more to the advantage of the story rather than making it turn out conveniantly happy in the end.<br /><br />The bad? Like I said earlier, I have tried and failed to read this book three times before finally completing it. The first and most glaring reason is the writing style. I completely and utterly hate it. I am not a big fan of the first person perspective in the first place. In my opinion, having the story told by one of the characters and only seeing things through their eyes gives a very narrow view of the world. I find that the different and often contrasting viewpoints offered by third person to be far more preferable as it fleshes out the world and gives a lot more color to things than you would normally have with first person. Though that is not the reason I hate the style so much. Some of my favorite books are told in first person and I love them despite my dislike for the perspective. The problem with the writing here, and I know that it's just me nitpicking over personal preference, is that it is told in present tense. Normally a story is told in past tense, in first person you have the character telling the story as though he or she is recounting it to you. In third person you have a narrator telling you what happened, and giving you varrying degrees of insight into the hearts and mindsof the characters. In this book Katniss describes everything to us as it is happening, and that really annoyed me. It was the major reason I put this book down three times, vowing never to finish it. I don't know WHY I dislike it so much, I just do. It was extremely distracting to me, making what would have otherwise been a very good book something that took me a few tries to finally get through. Also there are a few places where the tense is inconsistent, wavering between present and past, and I'm not talking about the flashbacks. This is a problem that I mainly lay at the editor's feet, however, not the writer.<br /><br />Collins seems to have a bit of a problem with writing action. When exciting things are happening the pacing needs to pick up. The tone needs to change. The reader needs to feel the tension and the danger. However, in this book, a lot of the action scenes are told with the same tone and pacing as scenes where the characters sit down to dinner. Think of it as though the most exciting part of your favorite book is being read to you in complete monotone by Ben Stein. That's what the action scenes in this book feel like to me.<br /><br />There are several uses of Dues Ex Machina, which, while annoying, do not completely ruin the story. Again, it's just me nitpicking. The real kicker here is that it wouldn't have been possible to call them Dues Ex Machina had Collins developed the idea of Sponsors better before the Games began. Not telling the reader their purpose beforehand basically gives the characters get out of jail free cards out of nowhere. I've been known to use the plot conveniance fairy once or twice in my own writing, and doing so doesn't usually ruin a story if its limited to less important events, however, when all of it could have been avoided with a single sentance explaining what the Sponsors do earlier in the book, that's just bad storytelling.<br /><br />There are a few very contrived moments in the story where it is impossible to call them anything but fake and forced, and again, it's just me nitpicking here, but when you combine it with the other things I've mentioned it's enough for me to take a couple stars off the rating.<br /><br />In conclusion, I did enjoy this book despite the flaws I found in it, and I am currently reading the second in the series. However, there were a bunch of small, insignificant things that I found to be annoying or distracting within the story that piled up. Therefore I'm giving it three stars rather than five. The action scenes are almost boring with no real tension or horror in something that should be completely horrible. The writing style is very annoying and distracting to me, and because of it, it took me four tries to actually finish this book. If you can get past the writing style and don't much care about Dues Ex Machina, and contrived plot convenience you will likely find a great deal of enjoyment in this book. Honestly though, a fanfic about Harry Potter Characters playing The Most Dangerous Game would likely have been far more entertaining.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot better when it was called Lord of the Flies. If you want a well written book about brutality and children murdering each other, William Golding is a MUCH better writer than Suzanne Collins, and his book offers some very provocative questions and messages. Such as what makes us human, and without our laws, our civilization, our society, we're no better than beasts. I found no message overt or hidden within The Hunger Games, except that it's all right to murder people if it's for the sake of survival. Not exactly the sort of thing I'd like my kids to take away from a book they've read. In fact, Collins seems to go out of her way to NOT give any real message in this book, which I found rather odd. Why give a shocking story of children killing each other and not try to teach a lesson with it? Whatever. *shrug*<br /><br />--EXTRA--<br /><br />The Hunger Games<br />Movie Review<br /><br/>2.5/5 Stars<br /><br />The Hunger Games made a better movie than it did a book. I enjoyed it far more than I did trying to decipher Suzanne Collins' incomprehensible writing style. That is not to say that it was a great movie. It had more than its fair share of problems. However, it WAS better than the book.<br /><br />First of all, I believe that this movie should be re-titled to Awkward Silence: The Movie, or perhaps Tell, Don't Show: The Movie. What little background music that there was--and let me tell you there was not much at all--seemed rather inappropriate to what was actually happening on-screen. Maybe 15 minutes of the bloated 142 actually had any real background music to it. And considering that the two leads Josh Hutchinson (You wouldn't know him, he's not in anything anyone has ever actually seen) and Jennifer Lawrence (X-Men: First Class) have about as much on-screen chemistry as a block of wood and a piece of stone, this leads to long, long, loooooooong stretches of awkward silence whilst two people who CLEARLY do not like each other try, rather unsucessfully, to pretend that they do. Actually, I think I'm being a little insulting to the block of wood. Hutchinson would have to take three or four steps up to be considered wooden. He delivers all of his lines in complete monotone and actually appears to be reading them from off-screen cue cards more than once during the film. And to be fair to Lawrence, her character is actually supposed to BE a piece of stone.<br /><br />Film is a visual medium. You see things. You hear things. This in turn makes you FEEL things. This movie failed so spectacularly to do so. There is an old saying when it comes to writing of any kind, but it applies doubly for any visual media. Show, don't tell. You show people things, you don't have someone sit there and tell you about them. Some things, it is true, are impossible to show, or lead to plot holes if you don't just sit down and explain them, but there was only one instance of that in this movie, and frankly, it was handled with much better care than it was in the book. Everything else should have just been shown. Let me give you an example from early on in the movie. It begins with white text on a black screen, telling you what the Hunger Games are. You're making a freaking movie for God's sake!!! Show us the damn Hunger Games and let us see for ourselves!!! Shortly thereafter we are treated to images of war whilst Donald Sutherland as President Snow narrates over the top of it, telling us the entire back-story. You know what would have been a more exciting way to explain the back-story and draw people into the movie right from the start? Take that same narration whilst the opening credits are playing, and show a montage of previous Hunger Games! You get the exact same information out, but the audience is absolutely riveted from the first image, they SEE the horror of the Games, and they FEEL how horrible it is. When you have pictures of nothing connected to what the Games actually are, and dry, boring narration, combined with white text on a black screen, it is not as powerful. It doesn't draw people in the way it would have had you actually shown them what the Games are like. This is made worse because they actually DID film scenes from previous Hunger Games. They show throughout the entire movie on TV screens in the background. A little editing magic and this Film would have been so much more powerful than it was.<br /><br />This also leads me to a lot of head scratching. Later in the film the back-story for Katniss' father is shown in a very well done flashback, rather than simply told to us. That two minute flashback drew me into the film far better than any other scene. It was very well edited, it had appropriate music, and it got the message across without speaking a single word. If the filmakers were capable of such brilliance, WHY DIDN'T THEY USE SOME IN THE REST OF THE MOVIE!!!<br /><br />The background music, the ambient sound, the sound effects, these things all come together to create the atmosphere of the film. They make you feel more like a part of the movie, instead of a spectator. They make the fake feel real. There was no background music during the vast majority of this movie, and the sound effects were rather lacking as well. At no point did I feel that these people were actually in a forest. It felt exactly like it was, a fake forest in a sound stage somewhere because shooting on location costs too much money these days. Most of the music that did appear in the movie sounded more like stock music rather than anything actually composed for this film. There is a credit for the musical score, one Stuart Michael Thomas, and my thought upon seeing it was, \\"what musical score?\\"<br /><br />This is, when you get right down to it, an action movie. And for an action movie, the action was incredibly lacking. Most of it happens off-screen to preserve the film's PG-13 rating. The action that does appear on-screen is in close up shaky-cam, which makes it near impossible to tell what is actually going on. Yes, I get that you want to add something of realism to the action, however, this is a film. The purpose of a film is to SHOW the audience what is happening. When your camera is WAY too close to the actors, and shaking all over the place, the audience cannot SEE what is going on and you have FAILED to SHOW them what is happening, negating the ENTIRE purpose of filming the movie in the first place.<br /><br />The Hunger Games has a star studded cast, including Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks from Scrubs, and Wes Bently of American Beauty fame. The problem with this is that NONE OF THEM ARE IN LEADING ROLES!!! Most of them are relegated to glorified cameos, and completely wasted in this film. They're shoehorned into scenes where they really don't belong just to give them something to do in the movie. Why even bother? And seriously, did they spend allof their money on these glorified cameos, leaving nothing for a soundtrack, some good sound design, a head writer that is not also the director, and lead actors that can actually act? I do have to say that Woody Harrelson COMPLETELY stole every single scene that he was in. He was the best and most memorable part of the entire movie. He seemed like the only actor in the entire film that was having a good time with his role, and he was perfectly cast as Haymich.<br /><br />For the most part Writer/Director Gary Ross took a book that was, let's face it, not very well written, and he made something that surpassed the original medium. Suzanne Collins, writer of the novel upon which the film is based, is credited as a co-writer, however I believe that this credit was given simply for a consulting role. Why? Because the screenwriting here, bad as it was, was LIGHTYEARS beyond anything Collins has ever shown herself capable of.<br /><br />With three credited writers, and eight credited producers, it is no wonder why this film is the mess that it is. My advice to the filmakers for the next film: Show, don't tell. One writer, who is not also the director. One Producer. Fire the rest of the yahoos and spend their salary on some real sound design, music, and real editing. If you liked the book, you'll probably like the movie. It follows the book very well and what changes were made to the story, in my opinion, were for the better. It suffers from a lack of general ambiance because the music and sound budget was obviously very low, and actors who have the on-screen chemistry of Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. And it does a lot of telling rather than showing. Also, there are a great many things in this film that will make no sense to anyone that has not read the book. Use your own discretion over whether it is something you wish to see or not.

0553801473|4.0|George R. R. Martin is considered by many to be the Tolkien of the modern day. If you don't know what that means, please go read Lord of the Rings like everyone else on earth, you're probably the only one that hasn't. Martin is well known for being able to craft extremely realistic worlds and characters, and for not following generally any story archetypes, preferring to come up with stories that might actually have happened in real life long, long ago. He is also famous for ruthlessly killing off main characters in rather pointless ways to illustrate that no one person is any more important than any other, be he king or beggar. This adds a further sense of realism to his books, because in real life even those important to the story of your life are not immune to death.<br /><br />Like many grand fantasy epics A Song of Ice and Fire began as a trilogy, but A Dance with Dragons was book five in said numerically challenged trilogy, and there is no end in sight. Whilst writing book four, Martin realized that the story he had outlined for that book was far too long to fit in a single volume. And so he decided that he could either write half of the story for all of the characters, or write the whole story for half of the characters. Eventually he decided on the latter, taking most of the characters I didn't care for and bundling their stories all into one book. This made for a rather painful reading experience, though it did bring me around to one or two characters that I previously had no love for.<br /><br />After a six year wait, book five has finally been released, the second half of the story that was to be part of book four. I cannot tell you how long I have been waiting for this book to come out. All of my favorite characters in the series that were woefully absent from the last volume are back, and none of the characters I disliked make an appearance at all. It was almost worth the wait.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons takes up where book three left on in the lives of Davos Seaworth, Jon Snow, the various Greyjoys, Daenerys Targaryen, Stannis Baratheon, Bran Stark, and Tyrion Lannister. Some plotlines introduced by characters in book four continue on during this book. This book is not a what happens next in the series sort of thing, it's what is happening with the rest of the characters during the previous book.<br /><br />Jon Snow grapples with being Lord Commander of the Knight's Watch, and guarding the wall while King Stannis tries to undermine his authority and take what he needs from the Watch to continue his war for the rightful claim to the throne. Winter is coming, and with it the Others and their undead servants the Whites. Food is scarce, money is even scarcer, civil war tears the seven kingdoms apart and none can hear his calls for aid. He is forced to take the Wilding people from beyond the wall to help man it against the Others. He lets the ancient enemies of the Knight's Watch, those who have fought against and killed many of his friends on the wall, through to help man it against their common foe, but his own men whisper that when the crisis is averted they will be surrounded by enemies in their own strongholds.<br /><br />Tyrion Lannister has many misadventures fleeing the Seven Kingdoms after murdering his father, plotting to return and kill the rest of his family as well. He seeks to join with Daenerys as she gathers her forces to protect the city she's taken as her own to learn how to rule before returning to the Seven Kingdoms to take the throne that is hers.<br /><br />King Stannis gathers the forces of the North to march on Winterfell to rescue the girl whom he believes to be the last surviving child of Eddard Stark from her marriage to Ramsy Bolton. Elsewhere the young prince, grandson of the former king who was overthrown fifteen years ago reveals himself with an army to conquer the lands that should rightfully be his. He was reported dead as an infant during the rebellion that brought down the monarchy, but through treachery managed to be hidden away in safety awaiting the chance to reclaim what was taken from his family.<br /><br />And north of the wall, Bran Stark finally comes to the home of the fabled Children of the Forest and the Three Eyed Crow who has called to him since he lost the use of his legs.<br /><br />The good? After the last book, which had only one character I liked in it, A Dance with Dragons had all of my other favorite characters and only my favorite characters. The world that George R. R. Martin has created for this series is extremely realistic and well thought out. His sparing use of magic as more of a superstitious sort of thing that only undesirables seek after is a refreshing change from fantasy books where magic is the solution to every problem. His grasp of politics and his extremely realistic characters make for a very believable civil war, and illustrate enmities between characters perfectly. Every one of the characters is distinct, with different personalities and goals. His female characters tend to think and act like real women, rather than like how men think women act.<br /><br />The bad? The cast of characters for these books is huge. There are literally hundreds of named characters, each with his own history that Martin will give once and expect you to remember. To further confuse matters many characters also have the same name, or are named after historical figures or places in his world. For example. There are two men named Pike, a place named Pike, and a Battle of Pike, all of whom are referred to simply as Pike. You're left to figure out on your own which one he means by the context, and it is not always clear from the context which he's talking about.<br /><br />There is a lot of rather harsh language, including the F word and the S word, as well as quite a few other offensive terms for genitalia, and other such things. Practically every single one of the characters in this series says or thinks at least a few words of harsh language during the course of the story.<br /><br />There is a lot of sex and crude talk of sex. The actual sex scenes are typically not graphic, but the language the characters use to speak of it usually is. HBO recently made a miniseries out of the first book in the series and--surprise surprise--it has more nudity in it than any other TV show or movie ever created outside of pornography. If these things offend you, you might want to steer clear. However, don't get the idea that this entire series is about nothing but sex, cursing, and nudity. That's really a very small part of the overall story. I would say read one of the books for yourself and be the judge of whether it's too much for you or not.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin has a strange sort of rambling way of telling a story. The way he talks about things is kind of like listening to a senile old man telling stories of his life that don't have much to do with anything. However, if you're not paying attention to pretty much everything during these ramblings, you'll miss something important for when he tightens the strings and pulls the story together at the end in a way that makes all of the rambling make sense. Some people I know have a big problem with that style of writing and have a hard time getting through things that they feel are unimportant only to find at the end that they were incredibly important.<br /><br />The ugly? This book is yet another in a disturbing trend amongst fantasy series of late, in that it doesn't have a clear climactic ending. The first book I noticed this in was Crossroads of Twilight by Robert Jordan, but other authors such as Patrick Rothfuss, Terry Goodkind, Orson Scott Card, and now George R. R. Martin have begun to do this as well. The climax is arguably the most important element in the plot. Everything builds toward it until it all comes crashing down in an avalanche of awesomeness. It's like the reward for finishing the book, you get a clear victory or defeat,something is resolved, and it's usually in a grand, climactic fashion. Many authors, of late who are writing series seem to believe that since their book is in the middle of the series, it doesn't need a climax to end with because it's not the end of the story, but this is very wrong. Each and every book needs a climactic ending, and no, a simple cliffhanger is not a climactic ending. It's just a lazy way of covering up that your book didn't have a proper ending. I know that George R. R. Martin is capable of coming up with epic climaxes for his books. Game of Thrones ended with the splitting of the Seven Kingdoms and the Crowning of the King in the North. A Clash of Kings ended with the Battle of King's Landing. A Storm of Swords ended with the Red Wedding and the Wilding assault on the wall. A Feast for Crows ended with Cersei's plots falling apart, and the last supporters of King Robb being wiped out. All of those were epic climaxes to epic books, however, A Dance with Dragons basically just ended mid story with vague cliffhangers for each and every one of the characters rather than a clear climactic throwdown. Writers need to stop doing things like this. It takes a great deal of enjoyment out of reading their books when the reader doesn't get anything to reward them for reading it at the end. The reason people read books is for the ending and this one didn't have one.<br /><br />The length between books in this series is ridiculous. I think the shortest time between any of them was four years. This one took six years to get out, and to make things worse, there was another book between this one and the previous one about these characters so the total wait time for the things happening in this book was about ten years. George R. R. Martin seems like he is a perfectionist and wants everything to be absolutely perfect before publishing a book. It takes him an extremely long time to do that as it is, but he also stops to write side projects and publish them. Between ADance with Dragons and the previous volume in this series he published three other unrelated books. The message boards on his web site are full of basically nothing but people complaining about how incredibly slow he is at getting books in this series out.<br /><br />To recap, yes, this book does have its vices, and it is not for everyone. Many people do not like Martin's style of writing. It didn't have a clear climax at the ending and far too many cliffhangers. However, one thing that should be mentioned again is that this is half of the story that was supposed to be in a single book. Therefore the climax of the previous book was likely intended to cover this book as well. Martin will likely return to form with the next book in the series, granted that he does not split the next book into two as well. Despite the lack of a clear ending where something has happened, this was still an extremely enjoyable book to read, and finally getting to what happens next with all of the good characters was almost worth not having a clear ending for any of them.<br /><br />I'm giving this book 4 out of 5 stars due to its lack of a climax, and the use of quite graphic sexual slang and language, as well as other bad language, and the gratuitous number of sex scenes. Martin is a great writer with great ideas, but he sure does have a filthy mind sometimes.
B006RED4GA|2.0|The Innkeepers was a movie I was most excited to see due to it's \\"fresh rating\\" on rotten tomatoes website. Just watched it and in the 101 minutes this film ran, only a handful of scares were there. This movie is slow and the characters are very hard to root for. By the end of the film I didn't care if everyone in the hotel died. The story of the ghost in the Yankee Pedlar Inn was vague and never provided answers for the viewers. Boooooooo!

B00000EVQ0|5.0|Overnight Sensation really showcases what Frank Zappa could do, and how creative he was. It shows him to be what he was - a Genius. Changes in tempo, key, cadence. Surprises at every turn. The background female vocals, Tina Turner and the Ikettes, is hilarious, when you consider the lyrics he had them singing (\\"What do you mean Cooties, no Cooties on me!\\" etc). Commercial? With these lyrics, and that percussion? Most people talk about \\"Dyna Mo Hum\\" and \\"I'm the Slime\\" but my favorite is \\"50-50\\". Three solos, Duke, Ponty, and Zappa. The first time I heard Ponty, I thought, for a moment, it was a guitar. Duke puts a wall of sound with the Synth and Zappa's break is one of his best. This was his best album.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|This is a not only a comment to the review, which was ha reviwers right to critique, but when I purchased this \\"must-have\\" for any fan of the era that The Floyd were in at the time. I can't get enough of the magic that was, Mason, Waters, Gilmore & Wright. My favorite era. This takes what was, and gives you that...then it gives you an update with more! I can't complain! I love them both actually with the scale tilting towards, \\"The director's cut\\". It breaks up the drone and adds some spice. In Pink Floyd history, this is basically it for that era. To add is to delight! A \\"Then & Later\\" (so to speak.) Plus the history itself of Pompeii as a historical place, crumbling as time goes on, is an added attraction. In the world of Pink Floyd, as with the newly released Immersion sets, more is simply better. Now, find a pristine print of \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\", for the US, an actual release of \\"The Final Cut Film\\"...put them preferably on Blu Ray, and this fan will be ecstatic!

B004M9ZI0M|5.0|I had never seen a woman play the role of Prospero/Prospera before - but, if anyone could pull it off, Mirren's the one. (Following her lead, I heard of a regional theatre casting Olympia Dukakis in the role, another strong choice.) Maybe some purists might balk at the shift. Really, though, the themes of power and control are human themes, irrespective of the man or woman who wields them. If anything, the mother/daughter relationship with Miranda added sensitivity that the usual father/daughter interaction has trouble carrying. And, when Prospera's exile from Milan comes up, it seems especially credible a woman in power would be a prime target for the old boys' club of political potentates. The choice of Djimon Hounsou as Caliban added a complex edge to the role, too. Casting a black as Prospera's slave evokes some shameful episodes of history, at the same time it gives hope that we've moved past them. (Perhaps that's what keeps Shakespeare's work timeless: its ability to absorb and play back the issues unique to each era.)<br /><br />Production values were all you could hope for - magnificent scenes of stark, rocky shores being the most memorable. In a move not often asssociated with Shakespeare, Julie Taymor's direction added some amount of special effects. Although meaningful, they came across as less than special, possibly more of a distraction than an addition. I won't let that interfere with enjoying this movie, though. It really does render The Tempest in beautiful and thought-provoking ways.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I use this app almost every day. In fact, I came out to Amazon to buy the app because it is so useful and I forgot that I'd gotten it as a FAoTD. I thought I had the free version because there are very, very few apps that I find useful enough that have a paid version that I'd pay money for.<br /><br />There are some radio shows that are kind enough to make their broadcasts available as mp3s which is why I tend to use this app so frequently. It is very easy to use and very handy to have available.<br /><br />At least one reviewer dinged the app because the files were unusable as transferred but that is not an app issue it must be a phone issue or an wifi signal issue with that person's phone or computer wifi.<br /><br />Well worth the purchase price.

I had to watch the first 30 minutes of this version of \\"Tinker\\" before I was altogether certain that Gary Oldman was even alive! Granted, the part of \\"Smiley\\" isn't one that projects vivacious glee, but whereas you can see the intricate gearwork turning in Sir Alec's portrayal of the main character, Oldman's version is expressionless, opaque, boring, and, (worse) not even particularly thought-provoking.<br /><br />You figure out what has happened, and who the real Soviet mastermind of the whole sordid mess is very soon, and the rest of the movie is just pro forma tedious boredom.  Oh, Colin Firth does make a game attempt to inject a little life and passion into this moribund mess, but in the end it's all really a waste of time.

1594202710|4.0|This is third book on my China series and by far written by most high profile author, who himself was at forefront in modern US China relationship, first as NSA and then as Secretary of State for Nixon and Ford administration.<br /><br />Written in chronological sequence, book follows history of China, its culture, philosophy and wars from ancient era to the times of Bill Clinton's presidency. For China starters, author has taken pain to explain all the basics. History of Taiwan, China Sea and China-Vietnam relations is particularly illustrative. The language is clear and straight.<br /><br />Coming straight from horse's mouth, book presumes high credibility, only to be undermined by author's grandiose and vindicative portrayal of himself, as well as few leaders of his choosing. While doing so, Mr. Kissinger crossed line of neutrality, expected from author of his stature. I was particularly put-off by the his supersized philosopher-king like description of Mao Zedong, often at the expense of other contemporary world leaders like Chiang Kai-shek, Stalin etc. Author's fascination with Mao, be is his habit of sleeping naked or defecating in open is bizarre. As per the book, everything Mao did had nothing but only great strategy and grand vision behind it. He even tries to put Cultural Revolution in positive light. This in light of the fact that Mao did not particularly liked Kissinger and often belittled him (Ref: \\"Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed the World\\" by Dr. Margaret MacMillan), shows that author was completely awed by Mao's cult of propaganda and violence and has some kind of complex about it.<br /><br />Interestingly his description of Nixon was not that rosy and author claimed many initiatives for himself, which has been historically attributed to Nixon. From writing style, one can clearly sense much speculated rivalry between him and Nixon.<br />His depiction of Zhou Enlai is particularly interesting and touching. He is one figure, who has generated a lot of curiosity inside me.<br /><br />Later part of the book which describes making of modern China and role Deng Xiaoping played, is relatively neutral and explain development more from an outsider's perspective.<br /><br />Overall a very informative and good book for readers who wants to know more about greatest transformation in world history. However you cannot rely on its neutrality and should be supplemented by some more unbiased sources, which can offset `go-go China' theme of this book.t of curiosity inside me.<br /><br />Later part of the book which describes making of modern China and role Deng Xiaoping played, is relatively neutral and explain development more from an outsider's perspective.<br /><br />Overall a very informative and good book for readers who wants to know more about greatest transformation in world history.

0345803485|1.0|Omigosh, are you serious? THIS is what all the hype has been about?! To my shame, I gave in to all the hype and purchased this novel on my Nook. I really have no clue why this series has become so incredibly popular. Yes, some of the sex scenes were hot, but after awhile, they kinda *yawn* just got boring...the couple sees each other, has sex and that's about it. I've read better sex scenes that stimulated me more in Nora Roberts novels. A few observations:<br /><br />* Ana, the main character, is incredibly annoying. She's a recent college grad who seems to have really no ambition or passion for anything other than having sex with the other main character, Christian. At one point, I think even Christian begins to wonder why she doesn't seem that excited about starting her career. She's also just really bland; there's really nothing very interesting about her and it made me wonder why a really hot billionaire would be so instantly infatuated with her.<br /><br />* The repetitions in the book are also incredibly annoying. Ana uses the phrases \\"Oh, crap\\" \\"Oh, my\\" and bites her lip so often that it also became laughable. How did all of that get past an editor?<br /><br />* Like other reviewers, I also found it distracting with all the \\"Britishisms\\" that were used. The author obviously has no clue how young American people talk- which led me to wonder why didn't she just set the story in London? That might have actually improved the book as I enjoy reading descriptions of other places around the world. It definitely would have made the dialogue more believable. Also, much of the dialogue was very cliche...such as when Ana \\"puts the pedal to the metal,\\" when she's driving and describing one of her sex experiences as \\"astounding.\\" Really? You couldn't use a thesaurus to discover more unique language than that?<br /><br />* I found Ana's lack of sexual experience to be very unrealistic. She's 21 and she's never masturbated??

B00005NVT1|5.0|Its a good album. Its made into only one track though. I like it, any real Daft Punk fan would like it. The album cover is just about all you see in the picture. Its has copy right, length etc. on the back of the cover. The bass seems a bit weak. But overall, it is a great album. And hard to find. (Especially new and inexpensive which I managed to find.)
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Blue ray would be a requirement for these movies, the detail is something you do not want to go DVD if you can help it, sounds amazing also if 5.1 is available to you I would highly recommend  this.  Very informative and creates a love for nature that could grow to define you as a person and change your outlook on your life.
B000000WCV|5.0|It is not their (Daft Punk)  best album, but it has some of their classics, like Around the Word and Da Funk. It is repetitive, but it has some good tracks too. I would recommend it for first time Daft Punk fans even though it was their first album (try Human After All or Discovery first). But later, it would be nice to have in your collection.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|Ender's game is classic book, representing some of the best in science fiction in the past 25 or so years, providing a solid foundation for Ender-verse.<br /><br />While the book jumps the shark on a couple events, the plot is consistenly good and descriptive, a must read if you plan on watching the 2013 movie.<br /><br />Must read for any avid reader also.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|This is one of Daft Punk's best albums! Its got nice beats and some classics like technologic and robot rock. And I really like Steam Machine. I definitely recommend that you buy it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|simple. addicting. fun. challenging. this game is worth it. don't be lame and use the hints though! Master the rain drop!
B006ZNRD06|1.0|i experienced the same issues described by other reviewers...worst is the audio/video sync. do not bother downloading this app...best option is to use Handbrake to convert to mp4.
B004LWZW24|5.0|This is my first movie review - I felt the need to write a review for \\"Insidious.\\" This movie is right up there with \\"The Exorcist\\" and this movie is the scariest I have seen along with The Exorcist! It will really send shivers all over you're body, and for some reason or another - it reminds me why one of the reasons meditation is help, to bring in positive energy.<br /><br />5 Stars - See it if you LOVE horror movies.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use during study. With so many different versions you can definately get a feel for what Gods word says.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game so much I love it I love it I love it! graphics are great and powerups are awesome.
0307593312|3.0|There is a reasonably intriguing story here and the slow, detailed exposition of characters adds a lot of depth and texture.  But after a while it feels interminable.  In the second half the sense of slogging through overwhelmed the positives.  It really needs better pacing and a more compelling climax/resolution.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game! its great on kindle fire. it is amazing and you can have as many games at a time as you want! Get it!
B007SSDDWE|1.0|this movie SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!  i was really hoping it was going to be at-least ok  but it more than failed.  I would not recommend it to anyone if you really want to waste your money  throw it in the trash
B0076NKLRQ|4.0|This movie revealed just how uneducated and not sophisticated this woman was.  She relied on her looks to created a false personality and was unable to identify or reveal a true self.  She had a personality based of what people thought about her looks.  She was so unsophisticated, that she did not know how to communicate her true self.  She kept seeking self worth through adoration of many, especially husbands.<br />A very sad and revealing story.
B007UXSDYU|4.0|I rented this movie not knowing entirely what to expect, but the premise sounded real interesting.  The Divide was played out with the most outstanding acting that I've seen in a long time.  It held my attention from the beginning to the end, and the director should win some kind of award for the way he perceives a group of people slowly slipping into insanity.<br />I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4, if it weren't for a couple of scenes that wasn't really called for.<br />All in all, I don't think I wasted my rental fee one bit...for that is how I rate my movies.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. this is the best and User friendly bible that I have ever used for an electronic bible
B005K17RU0|5.0|Unlike most weather apps this one is accurate and does its job well. And for sure you will use it a lot.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|If someone is reading this well, u shud listen, this game is amazing.first u pick a word (like horse) than draw dat, (like u draw a horse).And than ur friend will try to guess something dat u drew.if this is a hard explanation, well,just downlaod and play this game.If u don't like it than remove it from ur device
B007SYWFRM|4.0|don't understand the upgrades. cant complete the taskes don't know where to get upgrades from the game is fun but this feels like a set back
B007PTJOV0|4.0|like the game,  could be better with more levels. Kind of repetitive and needs more challenges. Its cool for what its worth though.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Couldn't believe that the story about such an important figure--the first and only woman prime minister of England focused on her delusional end!  I doubt that much of it was even true.  Was this in a way sexist?  It reminded me how the rumor began that Thatcher and the Queen were very much at odds with each other.  Both denied it.  Thatcher said the story of two powerful women being at odds with each other was just too good not to make up. I think that pretty much applies to most of this movie.  Streep of course was awesome.  Not enough for me though to give this a pass.
B0063IH60K|5.0|helps keep me busy on a cold rainy day. something to do while cooking dinner. good way to teach your child how to play
B002KSPKRS|5.0|For the price, these headphones are a no brainer for a serious gamer. They give you the sound quality of astros for almost half the price. They sound amazing. I played call of duty with them and i could hear everyones footsteps all around me. They are a big help in game modes like search and destrpy. They are only 2 downsides to the headphones. They are made of plastic so they feel really cheap and flimsy (but they're not) and sometimes if there is a signal interference with the GHz of the headphones, there is a loud popping noise that the headphones produce that hurts the ears. Besides this, they headphones are really comfortable, good sounding, and a great value.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app with so many versatile functions. it is nice to be able to share scripture that means a lot to me on twitter and facebook.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the various Bible reading plans that are available with this app. It's encouraging and easy to use. Once you pick a plan you can have YouVersion remind you of your plan for that day. Additionally regardless as to which version of the Bible you prefer you can access all of them. This has been great for my kindle!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Ignore the critics; Battleship is a hugely enjoyable movie that will have you wanting for more!! When I went to see this movie I was apprehensive that it was just another Transformers film. Fortunately director Peter Berg didn't let the aliens run riot unlike some movies I could mention. He seemed to have more control and as a result there is a much better balance to this movie. The story opens with NASA sending out signals to a distant solar system where they believe the existence of a possible habitable or Goldilocks planet. (How ironic that NASA recently discovered such a planet in real life, and should really please the production team). Unfortunately five years later the Aliens from said planet decided to pay Earth a visit. It is from this point the story really takes off with some sub-plots added that for once work in the movies favor. I also liked the misinterpretation angle used in the film between Earthlings v. Aliens and the fear from both sides you would expect in such a stand off scenario. There was a big question about Taylor Kitsch's ability to play a lead role, suffice to say he held his own on this occasion. The only disappointment is that there should have been a better rapport between Liam Neeson's character and Kitsch's. I felt Neeson's role as Kitsch's potential father-in-law was underused.In addition the soundtrack is extremely loud, so hopefully when shown in US cinemas the distributors will address this issue. Rihanna was also a surprise and proved she can handle action movies; fans will love her. Finally, without giving too much away its use of a very famous ship in the Finale sequence should appeal to many Americans, in fact I found the last 15 mins to be a very emotional thrill a minute ride. Don't miss it!!
B005OK725M|5.0|Nothing but action from beginning to end!<br />This is the type of movie you will want to watch over and over again.
0545265355|4.0|the first and the second hunger games books are the best books i have ever read, but the last one starts off better than book 1 and 2 , but the end is absolutely horrible depending wether your team Gale or Peeta if your team gale just write your own third book. Peeta is stupid.
B00782O7IY|4.0|I have been looking forward to the disc release of this film ever since I saw it in a packed NYC theater with a wonderful audience which so added to the experience.  You could feel them breathing and reacting to the images on the screen much like it must have been in the days of silent films -- but so much different from they way they react to regular dialogue films.  With that in mind, since at the time I am writing this I am seemingly the only Amazon reviewer to have actually seen the movie on DVD, I must warn you that watching a silent film at home is quite unlike watching a dialog film, especially if you are alone.  You must devote yourself entirely to the film.  You cannot look away from the screen.  In most dialog films there are clues as to what is happening if you glance away because you will continue to hear what is being said.  If you are not accustomed to watching silent films you might not fully understand this until you start wondering what just happened while I looked away?  In the theater I felt what was happening in the central action if I was studying something in the background of the film's set, but that does not happen at home.<br /><br />THIS is why I have been so pointed in my comments to some of the reviewers who obviously have only seen this movie in the theater because it will not be released on disc until weeks after they have submitted their review.  If you have not seen THIS PRODUCT you cannot accurately convey what the film will be like when watching it on disc in your home.  It's more than picture quality, it is more than plotline, it is more than whether this film is unique or derivative, it is an experience and in this case it WILL be different at home alone than it was in a crowded theater.<br /><br />I have given the disc four stars because the experience is a step below what the movie was like in the theater.  The acting, reacting, editing, musical support, plotlines, and inventiveness of this film are just as stupendous at home asin the theater.  It is far superior to Mel Brooks' \\"Silent Movie\\" which was a parody of the form in the same way as his work on Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows.  This is a tribute to the silent medium and is skillful in re-creating it without pretending the form was full of overacting.  It is more dramatically important than \\"Singing In The Rain\\" which bases the plot on the historically inaccurate concept of a John Gilbert-like actor with a high voice.  This gets a bit into the psychology of a silent actor who is master of his craft and unable to abandon it until some life-changing experiences.<br /><br />By the way, this is not a silent movie.  It is a dialog-less movie.  It has a skillful soundtrack of music, sound effects, and a few spoken words -- which actually I place in the category of sound effects rather than dialog!  The sound track supports the image on the screen and is an integral part of the movie.  As much effort and care has gone into that sound track as with any modern film.<br /><br />If you are willing to give yourself to this movie you will be rewarded.  While it really should be seen in the company of others who are likewise receptive to it, you will not be disappointed with it on disc.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you gotta lovec ice age. the graphics are great on a kindle fire. addicting and so cute. love checking in on this game. and I never write reviews.
1849386684|4.0|This is a good boook to have as a beginner and while learning from Justinguitar.com online I think the book needs to be explained a little better. As you progress with chords and strumming the book will come in handy.<br />The songs in the book are easy songs but you have to choose songs that you like. If you don't like or are not familiar with a song you are not going to enjoy playing it.<br />It's not a lot of money so buy it.
0345803485|5.0|I can't stop thinking about these characters and this love story.  I am really displeased though that most people all they talk about and see is the sex/bdsm, and the need for having to count words and state how bad it is written. I was able to look past that and enjoy a very good love story. This woman \\"Ana\\", a young college student, does what many women wish they could do and that is to change their significant other to become a better person. She see's \\"Grey\\", a rich 27-28 yr old man, for what he is \\"troubled\\" or \\"50 shades f'd up\\" and opens his eyes to what he could be. She helps him conquer his demons simply by loving him, encouraging him to be more open, and stepping into his world and trying his BDSM taste, although she is not 100% sure of it. Isn't that what people do for love? They try what other people like for them because they love them. She doesn't give in all the way but enough to show him that she loves him and to make him realize that he loves her. She is even surprised to find that she likes some aspects of his lifestyle. I loved the playfulness between the two main characters and you see how Ana has to adapt to this rich, complicated, but exhilarating life with a gorgeous f'd up man! The sex scenes were good but not hardcore and to me it was just a couple experimenting and I did not walk away from these books seeing only that and that as the main plot or reason for liking or not liking this book. My suggestion is to look beyond that and see the small details of the romance between the couple which include playful and teasing emails to one another, jealousy for one another, the eagerness to please and protect each other and willingness to do \\"more\\" for the person they love.<br /><br />I haven't followed Twilight or the Hunger Games obsessively like many fans and was probably the last to watch the Twilight movie. I did like the first Twilight movie but it seems I like one then hate the next then like the next so we'll see how the last one goes. Having watched the Twilight movies so far, I don't really see much of a connection besides 2 people falling in love and the males just happen to both be dark and rich. I think this story has more growth in the characters and is also more complete from beginning to end seeing why they are, who they are, and who they become. Incredibly, I find I relate more to Christian with all his problems then Anastasia but boy do I envy her for being so lucky. She's my heroin for sticking by her man and putting her foot down on her limits! I'm glad this was an easy entertaining read and it got me reading after years of not opening a book. I'm looking forward to more books from Christians point of view which, from the sample I see is going to have you thinking he's a jerk, kinky man one moment and a softy, damaged man in another. The author really makes you go back and forth on your feelings towards the characters but you also feel what they feel so well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I liked it but the energy kind of I don't like about the game I hope they make more game item's
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I think this game is very well done. I haven't had any problems with it. it's just like playing the card version only you don't have to wait or find somebody to play with. you can play whenever you feel like.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I thought this app was just ok but continued to use it for lack of my willingness to download another app on my kindle. THEN...they updated the app and now I love it! I don't see a need to fall back to weather channel app for backup now. has much more info now. earthquakes across the globe and lots lots more. love the warning and watch alerts (its tornado season here)! works great updates all the time.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|The part that plugs into the top of your bottle is barely even glued on. Mine fell off after 2 bottles and now just slides in and out of the control arm. So, what happens now is that I the distance between my original score mark and where I end up is quite different because the the apparatus is always on the verge of coming apart.  Again, this means uneven scores and uneven bottles. I would go for something a bit more sturdy.
0756407125|3.0|I loved \\"Name of the Wind\\".  I looked forward to this book like you could not believe.<br /><br />However, at a few pages short of 1,000 pages long, almost nothing happened. Kvothe lost his virginity, to a fae.  He learned how to fight, earned some money and a sword.  That is about it, in nearly 1,000 pages!  Whilst I am not the author and do not really know what developments are in store in the series, at a conservative estimate at least 300 pages could have been chopped from this book without adversely affecting the overall story line.<br /><br />Fortunately, I obtained this book from my library.  I would not have wanted to pay out good money for it, because it simply did not advance the story much.<br /><br />For those, like me, who loved \\"Name of the Wind\\", it is a \\"must read\\".  However, I hope that future volumes are edited more rigorously or we will be faced with monumental volumes to finish Kvothe's story.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|YAY! finally available on kindle fire I love this app it works great and I have 5games going on it right now and if you get a bad opponent theirs really nothing you can do - not the apps fault!!! On the downside yoou cant delete a game (or at least I cant figure out how)  but overall a great app
B005VTGB0S|4.0|This basically does what it is supposed to do. There probably isn't much that I can say about it.<br />The quality is sufficient and it seems quite sturdy.  It is pretty useful if you ever let other people  look at stuff!  As these types of products go it is reasonably value.<br />I tested it with an iPad 3 as well and it was a tight fit but it was just about usable.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Reading Mocking jay is a must when you have read the first 2 books. A bit slower to start then the other 2 books but a great end!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not put this book down. I am ashamed that I have overlooked this horrific hell-like existence for so many people. Thank you, Mr Harden, for writing it; thank you, Mr Shin for sharing your story and persevering to find life and love.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you just go to options in stuff the the bar for home and back and volume is there so you can get out of the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best stories I have read in many years.  Yes, it  is a good series for adults, not just teenagers!  It has many parallells to todays wars, and what we are doing to our young men and women in our armed forces.  This is a wake up.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I love this! It is so greatly for sharing pics and vids of the grand babies with Grandma! lg g2x

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I've owned some older GPS's over the last couple of decades- big and expensive but still useful = all Garmin. Bought the watch to have something that I could carry/wear easily and interested in having it store 'activities'. A friend uses the brand for all outdoor runs, walks, rides. I run, walk and hike (and bike) so I'm copying. On sale - discontinued I think. Works well. Been out of touch with the technology so what impresses me is Garmin's web-based interface for viewing info, the watch's ability to upload when you walk near the computer, reports, etc.. Is and will be useful.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So far it has been very captivating. The story line keeps me fully engulfed, and I cannot wait to finish the entire trilogy.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|finally on kindle!  excellent game and they seem to listen to fans / users suggestions / requests and update! fun for the young and old
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like that it is free. Great time killer. Don't like that you can't rotate buildings. And the people always standing around is annoying. But overall a good game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very Zen puzzle solving. Very cool relaxing music with great brain teasers. Easy to pickup and play for either short or long stints.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game. some games quite difficult. various skill levels make this game worth getting.  you can pass lots of time.
B003ASLJS6|1.0|I'm a fan of Clint Eastwood but not this movie. The acting is awkward and the script is a bit comical at times even though I'm sure it's not meant to be. The scene between Clint's character and the daughter is painful to watch.<br />She professes her love for Clint's character even though he's been \\"in town\\" only a few days. His acting in this scene is the worst I've ever seen however the ridiculous script left little to work with. All in all a forgettable western in the Clint collection. If you're itching for a Clint western go<br />with The Unforgiven, High Pains Drifter, The Good the Bad and the Ugly or The Outlaw Josie Wales and steer clear of The Pale Rider.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Films and movies are very story limited media. While they are able to show you what characters and environments could look like, they are restricted by time and budget to bring about and engaging and entertaining performance. I would compare it to reading shakespeare (not claiming this book is as good as shakespeare, or that I am able to properly judge that one over the other) verses attending a play. I would much rather watch a play rather than read the scripts. The book can give further insites such as the deeper meaning of a handgester or a symbol.<br />I find my inspiration to this chicken vs. egg philosophy from the evolution of the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy universe. Check out the history of media changes it has gone through.<br />*No spell check. Wish me luck*<br /><br />-Beers
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Thought the Series Game of Thrones was very well done and followed the books pretty<br /><br />closely. I am anxious for the Clash of Kings to come along..
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|some people say that the ads are anoying and u need wifi to play well if u dont install it to your amdroid device  right u need wifi. the ads are really small and i can hardly notice them. get free version because it is the same as the paid version so GET THIS APP
B006T5FDLG|1.0|i was more upset at the waste of time than the waste of money. but still not as awful as LULU!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! This is the best game I've played by far in a long time. Way to go!!!
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|Like many people, after hearing the hype this trilogy produced, I decided to read it.  First, the books are mostly well written, with descriptions that pull the writer in to the story and allow the whole story to linger in the mind for a long time after finishing the read.<br /><br />The first book, \\"The Hunger Games\\" was the best, but I could not get past the horrific torments these children were forced to endure.  That sentiment only increased throughout the series, and by the end of the book, I was in utter shock and disbelief that this was a series written for the teenage demographic.<br /><br />Admittedly, my experience of reading the books may be colored by my profession as a therapist working with traumatized children and teens and all I could see throughout the books were children continually traumatized by their government and people around them.<br /><br />The story will stay with me for a long time...but for all of the wrong reasons.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome. I totally recommend it. it wastes time in the easiest and most fun way. :) I always play this game when I'm bored.
0765316994|3.0|We all know if you are a Star Trek extra and wear a Red Shirt you are just fodder to be killed.  Scalzi takes that premise and makes it into a novel.  Read the description above if you want more.<br /><br />I love Scalzi's books.  I have read them all.  Old Man's War is on my favorites list.  If I had to compare the writing in Redshirts with other Scalzi books it would be the writing in Agent to the Stars and The Androids Dream, not Old Man's War.<br /><br />I think the theme limits the book.  The time line was created to mirror the writing on a popular TV show.  The main characters are extra's written in as placeholders.  They were not supposed to be that well developed and they are not.  You don't see much of the stars of the show and when you do they are definitely one-dimensional just like they are on TV.<br /><br />There is a lot of humor, play on words, and twists in the story.  I had at least one laugh out loud moment but in the end I was disappointed.  The story just never caught me.  I did like the Coda's at the end.  I found them more interesting than the main story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games rock i would recommend bye it oh wait you dont its free its one of the best games ever
B007JRU4N0|4.0|Acting by Clooney was superb!!  Movie was quite sad! However, the story line was<br />imaginative and interesting. It was probably 3.5 stars rather than 4
0811806405|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, this book contains an enormous amount of step by step detail on how to build a guitar.  That is the upside.<br /><br />The downside is that it is a quite dated, and the construction processes are daunting for the beginner.  Some of the tools are quite  difficult to find (some i could not find at all), and the builder has to fabricate numerous tools.  If you try to do everything the way he describes, you will spend considerable time and money hunting all over the area for tools, at least some of which are not available at the big box stores.  Others, I couldn't even find on line, except at considerable expenses.  Even the author admits on his webpage that his neck pinning procedure is daunting to execute, and presents an alternative.  He even concedes the book needs to be updated.<br /><br />If you want to build guitars, this book is worth having. I wouldn't use it as your primary text, though.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|Beg, borrow, buy, rent, or otherwise watch this Blu-ray version of a timeless classic in High Definition.  I never really saw \\"Gandhi\\" until getting the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The last truly great epic, Best Picture Oscar for 1982, among the finest movies every made.  Must do with only a few superlatives: Best Biography, Best Film About India, and Best Political History.<br /><br />My actual subject, trying to be helpful, is explaining how Blu-rays are so distinct from ordinary, standard definition DVDs.  The frame of reference so far is limited to Technicolor, excluding \\"black and white\\" + \\"animation\\".  I'm calling this Things to Know About Blu-rays:<br /><br />1. Blu-ray Fails to Play, So Try Again.<br /><br />\\"Gandhi\\" refused to play on my first attempt, failing to load.  I brought it out on the tray, and tried again.  Worked perfectly then.  Never give up on a Blu-ray disc without trying obvious remedies.  One simple trick is unplugging the Blu-ray player, waiting a while before plugging in again.  It's supposed to re-set the player, and has been a disc cure for me.  Also that error message of \\"No Disc\\" could mean forgetting to place a disc into the tray.  Human error, and I've been guilty.  Blu-rays also tend to have their own personalities, one of mine not playing until I connected the Blu-ray Player to the Internet.  Makes little sense, except to that particular Blu-ray.<br /><br />2. Blu-ray Fails to Play, Update FIRMWARE.<br /><br />This is where Blu-ray player owners have to know those players are computers, becoming outdated if not fed the most current FIRMWARE.  In your Blu-ray player's Operating Instructions, nothing is more important than the discussion of FIRMWARE updates.  Please read and understand it now, read it once more, and only then follow along.<br /><br />Please recognize that a Blu-ray disc stubbornly refusing to play, with or without a FIRMWARE update warning, coming with the disc, likely is trying to tell you that the Blu-ray player's FIRMWARE is outdated.  Newer the Blu-ray, odds go up that it's demanding the latest FIRMWARE.<br /><br />There are three basic ways to obtain and successfully conduct FIRMWARE updates:<br /><br />(a) Download them from your computer to a CD; then have your Blu-ray player play that CD.  It can work, although I couldn't do it myself.  Must be somebody's fault, either me, my old computer, or the Panasonic website.  So I had to try this:<br /><br />(b) Obtain the FIRMWARE update directly from the Manufacturer of your Blu-ray player.  That worked for me, thanks to great customer service from Panasonic.  Got the correct FIRMWARE update disc from Panasonic, at no charge, then fed it into the Blu-ray player, and everything worked, just like in the Panasonic Blu-ray player's Operating Instructions.<br /><br />Took care of the immediate problem, but I later stumbled into the best option:<br /><br />(c) Get the latest FIRMWARE update by connecting your Blu-ray player to the internet.  Of course I was only trying to stream movies + TV shows from Amazon and Netflix to my television.  In my mind, I was way behind when it came to enjoying the benefits of streaming.  Never thought about FIRMWARE updates, until time had passed and I needed current FIRMWARE.  Then it was suddenly extremely easy.  I simply moved my internet connection plug to the back of the Blu-ray player, which worked perfectly, one of TWO best case fixes as to FIRMWARE updates:<br /><br />* A Wired Connection of the kind I have, with a mandatory Router, and a 50 foot cord, since my computer and router are in a different room than my television.  I had also been advised how wired connections were better for streaming from Amazon and Netflix, taking such advise.  Also, with my Wired Connection, the computer can be turned off, while the router and DSL modem stay on permanently.  For no apparent reason, the DSL modem, once fairly sick, immediately got well, another welcome but unexpected side effect.  I am content with a Wired Connection.  The other option below was never considered by me, so I admit total ignorance, however you may already be using this, or otherwise prefer it:<br /><br />* A Wireless Connection, apparently quite popular.  No cords, plugs or router.  Instead the computer sends signals directly to one or more appropriate receptors, which likely requires a contraption to receive those signals.  If I'm even close to being accurate so far, it's time to stop.  Make your own decisions.<br /><br />3. Blu-ray still refuses to play, despite your being CERTAIN it's not caused by lack of a FIRMWARE update.<br /><br />Now you may really be in trouble, and must try determining the guilty party.  Might be a bad Blu-ray disc, so return or exchange it with the rental outfit or retailer, within stated time limits.  But before doing that, first try playing that same stubborn disc on a different Blu-ray player.  Could be your own computer or a Blu-ray player belonging to someone else.  With some companies, you will be expected to have tried this before returning or exchanging the \\"defective\\" Blu-ray disc.  But really do it for yourself.<br /><br />If the same disc malfunction, not loading or playing, stopping, including error messages, turns up on a second Blu-ray player, also with the latest FIRMWARE update, then you know it's a bad Blu-ray disc, possibly a manufacturer defect.  A manufacturer defect means plenty more Blu-rays of the same movie or show will be no different from the bad one you already have.  (Please read and understand my \\"Total Recall\\" Blu-ray review of a phony Blu-ray manufacturer scam lasting over five years.)<br /><br />Also consider whether you somehow got a Blu-ray disc for the WRONG REGION.  If it says \\"Region A\\", that ought to be good enough for Canada and the USA.  But if it says \\"Region B\\" or \\"PAL\\", this should be played in Europe, unless you have a Blu-ray player which likes PAL.  Mine finds \\"PAL/Region B\\" distasteful.  Here is one of the few problems where Blu-rays are not different from standard definition DVDs.  However, what I knew as \\"Region 1\\" for ordinary DVDs is now changed to \\"Region A\\" for Blu-rays.  Not done to confuse me, but that's exactly what happened.<br /><br />Plenty of retailers may send you a Standard Definition DVD or Blu-ray disc from the wrong region, always their fault; so immediately get a refund or exchange, ridding yourself of something that never will work on a \\"Region 1/Region A\\" Blu-ray player.  I would complain as well, because you are the victim, and somebody tried to cheat you or was incompetent, also wasting your time.  At least give that guilty outfit the lowest possible feedback ranking.<br /><br />On the other hand, should that same Blu-ray run perfectly on another Blu-ray player, then the disc is proven to be innocent. You must consider new suspects, starting with your own Blu-ray player.  Test it carefully, such as whether any Blu-rays do well.  Again, be absolutely certain there is no chance your FIRMWARE needs to be updated.  See the manual and telephone the manufacturer for support, if possible.  And I can't help you anymore, since this situation has not happened to me.<br /><br />4. Time to Load, Much Longer for a Blu-ray.<br /><br />Exploring the land of Blu-ray behavior quite different from that of standard definition DVDs, first you encounter just how much additional time it takes a Blu-ray to load.  This is normal, so get used to it.  Blu-rays are packed solid with a great deal more information than ordinary DVDs.  The longer wait will be worthwhile.<br /><br />5. Loss of Memory as to Where You Stopped.<br /><br />Also normal for some Blu-rays, especially older ones, you cannot count upon getting back to the exact location where you stopped playing a Blu-ray.  I advise always writing it down, the exact hour and minute count, before turning off your Blu-ray player.  This problem can be frustrating and ought to fade away.  I never understood color coded Blu-ray bookmarks, awaste of time in my opinion.  Here is the number one weakness of some Blu-ray discs, and if I knew more, perhaps the players can't be innocent either.  This we must put up with, never knowing in advance whether a Blu-ray disc will or will not perfectly remember where it left off.  I don't like starting over at the beginning again.  But you can recover by finding the right scene and beginning there, then moving to the place that ought to have come up on its own.<br /><br />6. Odd Responses to Normal Commands.<br /><br />I believe Blu-rays have personalities, not all the same.  One Blu-ray allowed \\"Fast Forward\\", but not \\"Rewind\\", also known as \\"Fast Backwards\\".  You want a MENU and keep hitting the \\"Menu\\" command, but the Blu-ray disc might not care.  Or you get confusing choices among \\"Menus\\".  Little or nothing can be done about it in my opinion.<br /><br />7. Lack of Synchronization.<br /><br />This also can be bad, especially with great musicals such as \\"West Side Story\\".  Might be the fault of my own equipment, but I don't think so.  Audio just slightly ahead of video can be terribly distracting, given how \\"West Side Story\\" was filmed, full of close-ups on the singers.<br /><br />No, it's not because Natalie Wood's singing voice was dubbed.  They never use voices recorded on any set.  Voices get recorded in studios for best quality, then perhaps either dubbed or the singers hear the recording and duplicate it during filming on the set.  Only exception known to me is Rex Harrison, who as Professor Henry Higgins of \\"My Fair Lady\\", was allowed to sing into a tiny mike, concealed as part of the Professor's tie.  That's what you learn from \\"Special Features\\".<br /><br />Unlike standard definition DVDs, some Blu-rays can't seem to prevent audio from staying just a tad ahead of video, even for entire movies.  I consider it another manufacturer defect as to \\"West Side Story\\".  Paying attention, it's somewhat common, but can often be ignored, which is my personal preference.<br /><br />8. Different Special Features (Extras).<br /><br />A normal Blu-ray will include, more likely exceed, whatever Special Features you already have or expect.<br /><br />With Gandhi comes the single best Special Features package I can recall, a separate disc with recent interviews and most of its content in High Definition.  Yes, I have returned to Gandhi.  Just don't expect other Blu-rays to match Gandhi's Special Features.<br /><br />Rarely will you encounter a Blu-ray with fewer Special Features than a DVD it replaces.  Anything can happen.  In that situation, a simple solution is keeping the appropriate Special Features disc you like, almost certainly an entire DVD of Extras from a 2-disc set, while the Blu-ray is on a single disc.  This way, worst case, you should never lose the Special Features you want, in addition to what marvelous Blu-rays offer.<br /><br />Hope this is actually helpful.Blu-rays are not different from standard definition DVDs.

B00003CX9S|5.0|And there WERE a few women in the movie who screamed in terror when accidentally walking in on the Elephant Man. You would think they had walked in on a body that had been hacked into pieces. It was the saddest thing ever. And this was the framework for the movie. We get a few glimpses of the Elephant Man before we finally see him full-on, including all the deformities on his face and the back of his head. And we eventually get to know him not as the Elephant Man, but as John Merrick, an intelligent human being with thoughts and feelings just like the rest of us. (The intelligence factor may be debated for some of the other characters in the movie.)<br /><br />I first saw this movie when I was a kid and I thought it was old because of the black and white. I see now that it is not; it was shot that way for atmosphere. It's probably considered classic now though, even though it's not really old enough yet (in my opinion).<br /><br />I love the lesson that this movie teaches. At its simplest, it is to treat your fellow human beings with kindness. There are a lot of things wrong with the world, but if everyone followed that one rule, we would be well on our way to a better world for everyone.<br /><br />It really is a shame this movie did not win any of the Oscars it was nominated for. I know Ordinary People won that year (because it happened to be the year I was born). The Oscars have made some questionable decisions sometimes, choosing some ridiculous movies as winners, but at least Ordinary People was a worthy movie dealing with another very important topic.<br /><br />It would be nice if The Elephant Man were re-released. $60? I really wanted to see this again, for the first time in 25 years, and I was very happy to finally find it at my local library.
B0050JN864|5.0|Must have new release for Bolin/Coverdale/Hughs fans. It's even better than I expected. Only wish all the songs played were from Come Taste the Band LP.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Addicted,  and i just started playing. I wish i would have found it sooner. It's really fun and im glad it's a free game. Even better!

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about. the game isn't that fun and if somebody takes forever to draw there isn't a time limit. I also cant forfeit a game. I don't like it very much.
B002LBGBR2|5.0|I loved this album so much that I bought the UK/EU Platinum edition.  So I bought it.  It comes with the DVD full of all the music videos of the Singles of the album.  It even has a music video for \\"Broken-Hearted Girl,\\" which was never a single in the U.S. and the DVD is clearly region free, because we can watch it.  So this is a good price for a great album.  The album shines I think at: Radio, Sweet Dreams and Hello.
B004LROUW2|1.0|Way too long, repetitive, boring at times.  I had to skim and skip entire pages just to get through the last third.  None of the characters were likable. Very weird.
B000F8O35U|4.0|For a long time, I was looking for this movie and it was just after \\"The Little Mermaid\\" went back into the Disney Vault.  So I went to Amazon.com and I got it for a pretty cheap price.  I love this movie and it has a French, Spanish, and English language track.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the perfect bible app and it's free!!  make sure you have a network connection or purchase an offline copy.  great app!
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I am such fan of George R. R. Martin and I have I expected more of the book six A Dance with Dragons,  and ended to be  very disappointed, what a drag!
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I picked this up on sale and for three movies pretty good deal. Watch over a long weekend or with friends on one long movie marathon. Bring popcorn.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I was so confused i tried to play it on my kindle fire and considering it had a good reputation I figured I would love it to but I couldn't even get pass the login screan it said I needed to put in my email or face book guess what I don't got eithor. Figures.<br />#voteBOTBB.mtv
B0050DIWFC|4.0|...you will love this book.  Reads like a Jodi Picoult coutroom drama, but written by a man.  Would make a very good bookclub book as there are so many issues for discussion.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Beaten and shot in the head at her own wedding, the bride (name not revealed until near the end on Vol. 2)is sent into a 4 year long coma. After mysteriously being awakened by a mosquito, she vows revenge on the people that took her down and ended the life of her unborn baby.<br />Yes, sweet bloody revenge is what this movie is all about, yet at the same time behind all the slashings, beatings, shootings etc there is a very powerful story. Quentin Tarantino was deeply influenced by samurai films and the exploitation movies that were coming out around his early years.<br />This movie delivers the goods including a virtually endless body count, music that fits perfectly with each shot, and classic references to other media and merchandise.<br />This is a film that is NOT to be missed. A very bloody masterpeice!
B000JMKRKC|3.0|Not crazy about the writing style of the author.  At times a little slow and at the end, felt she rushed trying to wrap up some loose threads (that didn't necessarily need wrapping up), however, the storyline was very interesting and left a friend (who was also reading it) and I with LOTS to discuss. Love books that leave me thinking and wanting to talk about it.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|My son loved this movie. Very quick and great quality.Something for the whole family to sit and watch.overall awesome. I know its an older movie but the classics are the best.
0345803485|1.0|I made the mistake of buying all 3 books to read on my trip to Europe. I did read all 3 thinking there must be more to the story... there wasn't. I do not recommend anyone read these books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is down right addicting. even when you first start it keeps bringing you back in everytime. good job to gameloft I have bought many games from them happy to see a Free one every now and again
B007SYWFRM|4.0|otherwise its a five star game. the characters are really cute. it has fast play if you want to stay in it for awhile.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app is my favorite app.  It has audio bibles on it that I listen to when I sleep and do the dishes etc... It makes bible study easier and I can study more while tending to a busy lifestyle.  There's so many versions of the bible on this app as well.  Every christian should have this app!
B005MMJ84K|2.0|May contain some spoilers!!<br /> I wasn't too thrilled with Pandemonium. To me it felt like a big letdown.  Like others have mentioned, it took a while for the book to get going. Needless to say, I was quite bored till about the middle of the book.  I didn't like the book being split up into Now and Then sections.  The minute something good was happening, it would switch to the Then and you were left hanging for a few minutes till the story picked up again in the Now.  I kept waiting to hear more about Alex, but that never came either.  It's been so long since book one that I don't remember much about Lena and Alex's relationship.  I really liked Julien's character.  It seems realistic for them to have fallen in love after being kidnapped, thrown into small quarters, having their life threatened, and saving each other's life. What is Lena supposed to do...mourn Alex's death for the rest of her life.  I mean, were Alex and her even going out for that long?<br />  The best part of the story for me was the end. The book finally picked up and I found myself not skimming over the book as much. Lena finding out she already met her mother was a great twist and I look forward to reading more about her mother's story.  I do not like the characters being placed in another love triangle!! Alex showing up at the end didn't really surprise me one bit. I'm sick of the YA triangles...don't want this to turn into another Team Jacob/Edward or Team Peeta/Gale...so over it!! But needless to say, I will be reading the third book.
1577314808|5.0|I just bought the book I'll choose to join the 10% that love this book ;) if you think negatively about a positive book that's exactly what you'll get out if it... Just like anything else in life :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i like this game. except for the time to rregain energy and needing to do something everyday in the game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|only improvement would be more game options but I think they want to sell those. ok with me. I'm happy with the freeware.
0385344228|2.0|I read this on my older brother's recommendation and I usually always like what he suggests, but this one I just didn't get why he praised it.  The dialog was stilted and leaden, there was really no surprise until the very end and even that wasn't all that big of a deal. It wasn't especially exciting and it came off feeling unfinished.  Part of the book seemed to be setting up Derek and then the author just walked away from it.  Left the whole relationship between Neal, the narrator's competitor, unresolved.  I gave it  two stars instead of one because I finished it.  Most books I don't like I quit after fifty pages or so.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Each segment of the trilogy was a fast, one day read, due to the inability to put the book down once submurged in the plot. The first of the trilogy was by far the best ... the ending of the third the least satisfying. You found yourself caring for the characters, which is paramount in mental vacations, yet the underlying theme of the series is as relevant at today's news.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book made me hot in the pants, some things where a little odd, but the story still worked out just fine. This book is a real page turner!
B007EC27QM|1.0|there were not enough features. it is a good calculator for arithmatic an NOTHING ELSE. its pretty but I immediately got another free app after I paid for this one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it is an awesome game that you can socialize with and show off your talent for drawing skills or tricks
1594744769|4.0|Just two things I didn't like. The I'm going to fake a seizure and epileptic dance. I  like some friends of mine have Epilepsy and have to deal with seizures.<br /><br />Otherwise, Good book
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I like it. ! if you are looking for that good game to pass the time when you are on the pot this is it. stages are just long enough so your legs don't fall a sleep.
B005EGXTL2|1.0|If you want to read a book that almost exclusively details a teenage girls repetitive, shallow and boring inner monologue while everything important is happening elsewhere and briefly yet inadequately gets explained later, then this book is for you.<br /><br />This book is completely detached from the rest of the trilogy.  We learn that nothing that has happened thus far, except for Katniss' inexplicable celebrity with everyone in Panem, is important or even relevant.  Everything we know about Peeta, Gale and most other main characters is irrelevant as the characters as you know them do not make a single appearance.<br /><br />Collins seems determined to kill off important or beloved characters in an attempt to shock you, only to never be mentioned again (unless of course it's time for one of Katniss' break-downs).<br /><br />Collins also seems to be obsessed with humanities ultimate failing as a species with no redeeming qualities, to the point where it bursts through into the story, much to its detriment.<br /><br />The writing, especially in the second half of the book, is downright lazy.  Things start happening with no explanation, character motivations are never explored, important events are brushed over or simply used as an excuse for Katniss to be sent to hospital and drugged again and the ultimate choice between Peeta and Gale does not appear to be made entirely within reality.<br /><br />There is not a single authentic character interaction in this entire novel.  My best explanation would be that Collins was making it up as she went along and it is my earnest recommendation that you do not read the book and imagine your own ending to the Hunger Games trilogy.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|I've played this in a book before and I loved it. With this app DONT GET IT!!!!! It froze up my screen so I had to wait a day for someone to fix it. It TOTALLY crashes you Fire.
B005NQ94KS|4.0|Very good movie -- stays very close to the book.  I was reading the book at the time I saw the movie.  It is sad though -- a story of friendship and love and the growth of a relationship.
B003DZX3SA|1.0|I purchased this for my two year old cousins birthday and when she played it last night( which was when I gave her the dvd)it skips and now I am out the money because the return date expired...So if you plan on purchasing this as a gift do it closer to the time you need it because it might now work properly and you will be stuck with it
B004JY0KP8|3.0|This is a well made watch, but the watch itself<br />is too big and thick. I thinks it's the new fashion,<br />but I don't care for it. But it is well made.
0375826742|4.0|THE BOOK WAS GOOD, BUT LIKED THE OTHERS BETTER. I am ordering the next one. Have to find out how it ends!
B002ZG99A4|3.0|Loved the movie, full of testosterone, explosions, and cool guns, what's not to like...oh, there is the matter of all of the STUPID, DAMNED COMMERCIALS at the beginning, that turned it into a three-star rating, I don't like being suckered into buying ads.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|puss in boots what a graet movie very funny, action plus, liked it a lot, very well done, good story.
B004GJXQ20|1.0|I'm sorry, but I just don't get this. I had to read this as I'm a big fantasy fan and this is all over the television. I tried the TV show and got bored and hoped the books would be better. This one certainly isn't. I half feel as if I'm missing something but this just reads like a huge list of made up place names and people and lots of talking and political plotting interspersed with bits of adventure as a sort of add on. Not my thing at all. Bring on the simple action heroes for me! No politics, just kill the bad guys and rescue the princess, that's what I want.
0439023491|1.0|We don't need to entertain our children with violence to help them understand that violence is wrong. We need to stop entertaining them this way and find more pleasant forms of entertainment that will lead them to act on those purer instincts.  They see in society PLENTY enough that violence it wrong. This is all twisted thinking people. Parents, talk to your children, spend time with them, play with them,  talk to them about violence, but by all means, stop entertaining them with it.  Have courage, and rise above the masses.<br /><br />This series is sickening, as are many others being thrust at our children by adult authors. Stop!!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I ended up watching this movie 3 times on a flight to Hawai'i and liked it more each time. I think the acting is solid, the story is great and the way it is shot just puts you in the action. This is one of Matthew Mc's best role to date, he really works it well.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|The game is saying that I need to play on only one device, but I only have it on my Kindle Fire.  My wife is having the same problem with hers on her iPhone.  Both of us use our separate facenook accounts to play the game on our separate devices.  Yet neither of us can play anymore.  What was really weird is some of her games started appearing on my Fire.??????  We even tried linking our accounts with our emails instead of our Facebooks but that didn't work.  This game no longer works and I can't recommend anyone download it.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry and it really shows us what great actors Meryl and Clint truly are. This is a classic film that brings out so much emotion it is simply impossible to look away.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I found the plot very interesting and the hidden psychology of post war victims quite thought provoking, however, the poor grammar made the reading a bit difficult. It interfered with the flow of the story. Either the writer was a genius, and wrote it as a poorly educated teen or the publisher and editor of this book should be fired.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app and fun game...  I recommend that; for those who are having a busy day and just need a moment to unwind they should get this game...
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I watched this movie just the other night and I must say it is a great movie. The movie had great acting in it. I think they spent more time on Zach being mad than the real lovey scenes. It was still a great movie even with that. If your looking for a romantic movie to watch alone as I did or with your significant other this is probably the perfect movie. It describes the struggles of change in your life with the people you love.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I knew Fifty Shades began as fanfiction, and I saw a lot of similarities in the first book, and then in the second book with the separation of Christian and Ana.  As that was resolved early on and the story continued (in Fifty Shades Darker), I forgot it was fanfiction and became immersed in the story of Christian and Ana.  In my opinion, this third book should not have been written.  The second book ends happily enough, with an open ending allowing the reader to imagine the happily married couple.  But alas, in Fifty Shades Freed we are once again reminded that this is, indeed, fanfiction and this installment resumes its parallel to Twilight.  If you're not a fan of Breaking Dawn, you will most likely not enjoy Fifty Shades Freed.  It was frustrating, because there were moments  I absolutely loved and moments I hated, but overall I was left dissatisfied.<br /><br />What I loved: Christian.  He's in the book, therefore it is enjoyable.  This book begins with the honeymoon (and a brief flashback about the wedding) and culminates with them beginning a family.  An epilogue is provided that explores their life a few years later, and we get to see Christian and Ana as parents.  That was a charming addition, as was the bonus section wherein the story of the interview from book 1 (where Christian and Ana first meet) is told from Christian's point of view.  It ends too soon for me, as I would love it if the author had extended it through their coffee shop meeting.<br /><br />What I disliked: Just as in Breaking Dawn, Ana gets everything without having to make a sacrifice.  Christian is *slightly* less demanding, he is remodeling a home for her, incidents happen that could turn out badly, but no...everything ends wonderfully.  He even gives up Mrs. Robinson--for good.  Don't get me wrong; I like a happy ending, but this was really too much.  It was unrealistic and far-fetched.  I thought there were times when Dr Flynn (the psychiatrist) could have been reintroduced.  When Ana tells Christian about the pregnancy, I was hoping we'd get the doctor's perspective, but for some reason he was unavailable in this book.<br /><br />By this point, I was getting a little tired of the sex scenes and did appreciate that there's a period (albeit brief) when the couple isn't in bed constantly and they acually work through some of their issues.  That did make it seem more like a \\"real\\" relationship to me.  It's still an enjoyable series, and one that possesed my thoughts in a most obsessive manner, but I had such high expectations that were not realized in this conclusion.  Considering the shocking nature of the first book, I was expecting a surprise or two in book 3, and it did not deliver.
1451673442|5.0|Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Rhonda! This is a book that I was asking for. A clear step by step guide to become rich and happy. 28 days and your life is on a completely new level. Smiles, happiness, money, health everything is flying into my life. I keep counting my blessings even after the 28 days period. It works! I have 3 things to say: thank you, thank you, thank you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. Very similar to Mario so Mario fans this is for you! I would love to see other games like this one.
B006Z7Z3R2|2.0|This was a blind purchase for me. The plot sounded interesting, a ghost story, scares and suspense. But after watching this film, it became apparent to me why classic horror still rules the roost and why modern horrors like this really dont work.<br />If youve read other reviews you know the story of the last 2 innkeepers in a hotel that are interested in discovering and communicating with ghosts. So our characters Claire and Luke spend about 80 of 101 minutes looking for these ghosts while old deceased hotel guests check in.<br />Problem # 1 - would you be so accommodating to a guest so obviously not quite there.<br />Problem # 2 - when Claire is told by*Lee* to get out the hotel before youre killed, what does Claire do ? Stay in the hotel, is left alone by Luke and goes wandering off into the hallways and back to the basement where the ghosts are waiting. Hello !?!?!?<br />Some payoff, hard jolting scares of our ghost attacking Claire that really meant nothing. Claire should havent even been in the basement in the first place.<br />Was this movie worth being so patient for that ending? NO. Was House of the Devil better ? Yes.<br />Claire (played by Sara Paxton) was so naive that it wasnt funny. Calling out \\"Lee\\" in the basement when she was clearing seen going upstairs was absurd. Maybe Ive seen too many horror movies to know whats going to happen in a movie like this , or is it I know what a good horror movie is - and this wasnt. If youre not going to do anything with your characters for over 90  minutes you could at least make them interesting. Or competent.<br />Id say this would appeal to House of the Devil fans. For others on the fence, maybe rent it. Remember these reviews are just opinions be it 5 star or 1 star, and the best reviewer is the person watching it with their own two eyes.
140053271X|1.0|I got mine for a vacation, loaded books on, and was SORRY.  You HAVE to use the touch screen, but the one on my unit is really flaky -- sometimes it just works, and then it just won't, resulting in massive frustration.  It's not just me, either -- when it's not working, nobody in the family can make it work.  And then, later on, it suddenly works again.<br /><br />Tech support has been useless, disconnecting me twice after it was clear that their \\"troubleshooting\\" wasn't effective.<br /><br />The software for it is pretty darn mediocre -- it's a READER, which means my family uses it to READ BOOKs.  But it doesn't distinguish between books we'v READ and ones we HAVEN'T.<br /><br />We can put books onto shelves -- but when we add a new book, we can't just add it to a shelf -- we have to find it among all the other books, and add it on.<br /><br />In short: sorry I got it, never want another.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|if u want to get out the game push the options and ur bottom home bar comes up. that is all
0452289963|1.0|One of the poorest written books I have Read. Run on sentences. repeat of same information 2-4 times in first half of the book. Ok so I didn't finish the book. I did about half, so give the rating a half star. Completely Eastern religion based and New Age.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is revolutionary because it is a great summary of all findings about diets and health-related studies weighted for an average reader's understanding. It is not boring to read and probably will change your view of what health and medicine really is about. I tried the \\"change\\" two years ago and I am VERY satisfied!

B0071DJZZA|5.0|i bought this book partailly by all the hype and partially becuase my fellow class mates and loved it. if you enjoy a fast paced action packed all around good read, this is for you. also, check out some of suzannes other works of art, mainly the overlander series. in my opinion, mockingjay is the best book of the hunger games.
0545265355|5.0|I have long been a Lord of the Rings fan and fell in love with the Harry Potter series. I needed another fix and found it in the Hunger Games trilogy.  Beautifully written for all from middle teens to those of us of more mature years.  Having seen the first movie of the series I eagerly await the next two.
B0043U937Y|5.0|This series is amazing to say the least... If you liked Rome on HBO then you will love Spartacus. Sexy, violent, smart and true to the way things probably were in that era.<br /><br />Cant wait for Season 3
B00164GDD2|4.0|It's not.<br /><br />If the picture looks terrible it is probably because your brightness and sharpness (or both) are set too high on your HDTV. If you haven't adjusted the TV much from factory settings then it is even more a given.<br /><br />I can toggle between a few picture settings on my TV. When I watch Ghostbusters on the settings I tweaked myself, the movie looks great! It has visible grain like it should and is a really pleasing picture that blows any previous DVD of the movie out of the water.<br /><br />When I toggle to a picture setting more like a factory setting, it looks awful with lots of white noise that represents the grain. The factory settings are usually too bright and made for the dealer show room instead of the living room. They usually have sharpness increased which causes \\"edginess\\" problems and that also includes the grain.<br /><br />on a properly set TV, Ghostbusters looks fine.<br /><br />The reason why I am docking the blu ray 1 star is because of the sound mix which lacks the directionality I remember from having the movie on a stereo RCA CED Selectavision disc (remember those? that's all this poor high school student could afford). And believe me, I know that movie soundtrack like the back of my hand from watching GB so much back in the day. I am talking about stuff like the door slam being heard on the right when Dana pushes Peter out into the hall and Louis's door opening and shutting on the left in the same scene. All that is in the center now. The music is not as robust and surrounding as I remember it as well.  It's not only on the blu ray but the previous DVD's too. It seems the remixes of these older films aim for less directionality. Maybe one of these days I can sync up HD Ghostbusters video with the old stereo tracks that has everything in places I remember.<br /><br />But otherwise, great blu ray with great extras (some ported from previous releases).<br /><br />By the way, since the blu ray makers know that many end userswatch the movies on TV's that are set in such a way as to make visible film grain problematic, they end up applying digital noise reduction which reduces grain but also reduces detail. Whenever you see a blu ray and the actor's faces have a \\"waxy\\" look, you know it's been run through lots of DNR and dulled the film grain along with detail. I am quite glad this was not done with Ghostbusters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Characters I cared about. Fascinating situation with lots of mystery and complexity. A page-turner that kept me up and awake far later than I'd care to admit. I particularly enjoyed the way the story was about itself, and not about any one protagonist. The Silo people come and go, but humanity itself staggers on into an uncertain, yet cautiously optimistic future.<br /><br />I'm a voracious reader, but if there's one thing I've noticed in the last decade or two, it's that even the biggest authors' books are, well, declining in overall quality. The big publishing houses are skimping on the editing (honestly -- when you find typos and grammatical errors in a Stephen King novel, you know they're dropping the ball). Sometimes from the last chapter or three, you can tell exactly when the author ran up against a publishing deadline, and I'm talking main-line famous authors. Sometimes it feels like the publishers spent more money on fancy covers than on decent editing.<br /><br />Anyway, I received a Kindle Fire for Christmas last year, and have been making good use of the Prime lending library. Still, I'm very critical and have no patience for lousy writing or predictable plots. Out of four books borrowed, I returned two after the first few chapters.<br /><br />So there's the Wool Omnibus Edition. I can give it a try at no risk whatsoever. I do so. Last night, I finished the five book series and it's 4am.<br /><br />And today I'm back to buy the series, because I believe the author, Hugh Howey, well deserves some financial support for the entertainment he's given me over the last two sleepless weeks. I'm also going to pick up his [[ASIN:1475154771 First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series)]] prequel.<br /><br />Support independent authors!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a great game, you can watch short movies and play mini games. its so much fun for me and my son!
0345803485|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, having heard about it on television, the internet, the radio and through friends.  The writing was sophomoric with the same phrases repeated over and over throughout the book.  The sex scenes, although very explicit, didn't sizzle. Is all the hype just the sheer shock factor for people who've never read a book like this?  I've heard the second and third books were better, but I'm hesitant to invest the time in reading them because I'd heard the first book was fabulous, and I was thoroughly disappointed.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|It took a few games to get used to it, but the game play is very fun.  Speed up time and it is fast pace too.  Different idea, as it makes you play different modes to unlock $ to buy items for the campain.  Since the other modes are fun, it is not a bad thing, just different.  The campain mode looks to be short.
B007AL48UK|3.0|This was a fun game at first but there's no challenge. If you pay for a game you expect it to have more levels. I regret buying it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It is fun at first, but then it gets hard too fast.  They should have an easy setting that gives you extra guys or lets you pass the level after 5 tries.

B0074EIQQU|1.0|As with every TMV release from Amputechure onwards -including, and in particular the el Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez- group frontman/vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala is the weakest link, proving it with this Spinal Tap-esque terminal excreta called NOCTOURNIQUET: an appropriately ironic title for has-been 40-something hipster Bixler-Zavala; the only thing preventing a doze into the comparatively blissful silence of sleep whilst listening to this album is the freak-eunuch, electronically treated spastic faerie-mewlings of the vocalist as he smears his farce-tastically unplayful neologisms over the otherwise acceptable instrumental work accomplished by the group's talented half.<br /><br />The Mars Volta is a chameleon, shape-shifting recycling plant for the transmogrification of what's actually happening and relevant in contemporary music into an acceptably neutered and consumable package for the ADD-ADHD/\\"I-me-me-mine\\" generation.<br /><br />This is the \\"Dad-Music\\" of the future, and it is stillborn.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Based on the other MI films I was expecting to enjoy this, but it surpassed my expectations. The stunts, writing, humor, filming and performances were all top-notch. The film managed to poke fun at itself, and at the MI genre, in an affectionate way without becoming a spoof, so we could still take the action seriously. Cruise is in top form here, and his supporting cast holds their own. As for the stunts and filming, these are the best I've seen in an action film in awhile, mostly because they are a cut above in terms of creativity. Shots of Cruise scaling the 'tallest building in the world' in Dubai, or trying to trick a guard at the Kremlin, are innovative and perfectly shot. The story is not terribly original, but that's not the reason to see this film. I'm not always an action-film kind of gal, but I think this one is worth it.
B001R22TBI|5.0|This young woman is phenomenal. A friend in Europe turned me on to her and I can't get enough of her. She sings like an angel. Nothing she has done has disappointed me.  Why she is not more widely played in this country is a mystery to me. You will not regret this purchase.

B00000JHAU|5.0|Though I didn't buy the album from amazon (I bought it in a record store), I thought I would give it a review anyway. Since it's the same album in the end, I thought it wouldn't matter. AND what an album it is! Great collection of songs and great songwriting from Stuart Murdoch. Very cohesive and memorable. There's something about the melodies that are immediate. You feel as if they were around all along. The lyrics are great, they fit the music and mood perfectly and effortlessly. The music is also very unique, a successful meld of 60's pop, scottish indie pop, the smiths, folk, baroque etc. The sound truly belongs to them.<br /><br />And all this nonsense about them I hear, \\"they're twee,\\" \\"wimpy this and that\\" is not true. Yes, the lead singer does have a frail sounding voice, but unless you're testosterone levels are on par with Sylvester Stallone, it won't bother you. Although oddly enough, I feel even he will appreciate it.  But also, the voice fits the lyric subjects and music well too. I can't imagine someone with a voice like James Hetfield (of Mettallica) singing it. It just doesn't have the emotional frailty of Stuart's voice. And \\"twee\\" would imply \\"sweetness\\" Let me tell you now, Belle and Sebastian are NOT sweet, they are very real.<br /><br />But if it does bother you, I don't know what to say. Well, I'll say Belle and Sebastian ARE a cult band, so they'll never have a following as large as a big act. And this is because they mostly cater to a small population of overly sensitive young boys and girls, and perhaps I am one of them and you are not.
B005HSL626|3.0|its a fun game but it freezes and a bunch of adds pop up.I recomend u buy it but look out 4 all the adds.1  other thing is that when u play it half the screen goes blank then an add pops up and the game is still playing!? !?!x

0307719774|5.0|This book is really cool.  Over the course of five years you answer one question a day.  I have only just started, but I'm excited to see how my opinions an answers play out over the next five years.  Very cool product.<br /><br />The book is nicely bound, gilded edges, and sturdy.
0714843377|5.0|Just finished this book not to long ago and I loved it. Paul's got this charm that he's able to convey through his writing. Great advise and insights that seemed obvious after I read it but never really occurred to me prior.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is very hard to put down. The characters in this book start to feel like family and you have to keep reading to make sure they are ok. As an older reader;the mother in me wants to protect Katniss and as a woman once a young girl; I wonder what her life would have been like.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Great movie.  The grandkids loved it.  Shipping was very quick and the price was excellent.  I would recommend this movie to kids aged 2 to 10.
B002962RKE|1.0|If your into political correctness, constant gay agenda being pushed on you, and right wing hate, then this is your show. Glee has no apologies about it. It pushes the liberal agenda so hard on this show it hard to enjoy it as realistic and entertainment...that is unless you yourself are a liberal. Constantly pushing the gay agenda and teen sex, this show is tackles issues that most don't, because unlike this show, most shows pretend not to be liberal. Not this show. They make is so obvious I won't let my kids watch it ever. Terrible Show and it's shows like this that are making this country a worse place to live.
0439023491|4.0|So Katniss thought she pissed off the Capitol with the berries at the end of the Hunger Games?  She's right, she did.  And this book tells what happens after Katniss & Peeta survive the games and return as \\"victors\\" to District 12.<br /><br />She has no idea the rebellious spirit she has unleashed in Panem's population. But President Snow does, and he's determined to catch the \\"girl on fire\\" before her rebellious spirit \\"catches fire\\" among the oppressed of Panem.  The book, as the first, is written in a first person narrative, so it keeps moving at a quick pace and Ms. Collins has a deft way of creating a \\"cliff hanger\\" surprise at the end of every chapter.  So, it's and easy and still unpredictable read.<br /><br />We are introduced to some new and interesting characters:  Finnick, Joanna, Beete.  We find out more about Haymitch and his Hunger Games experience - explaining a great deal in regards to his drinking.<br /><br />Only four stars because the very end was a teensy bit confusing - but don't let that stop you from reading...it won't disappoint.

0345522478|4.0|The urban fantasy landscape is a pretty cluttered place these days. It wasn't all that long ago that this sub-genre didn't even have a name, now it seems to dominate the shelves. With so much product out there fantasy readers can be forgiven if an awful lot of it seems pretty similar. Witch/wizard in our modern day society, yet somehow hidden, that works as a police officer/private eye that has an ill advised romance with a vampire/shapeshifter. If you think about it that describes a scary amount of urban fantasy. Then there's this tagline: 2300 year old druid, owns a bookstore in Arizona, avoids relationships but gets to sleep with the occasional literal goddess.    Ok, that's different enough.    And just as my pithy description of other urban fantasy series doesn't do them justice (as, frankly, my two favorites can be so described), neither does that tagline really capture Kevin Hearne's 'Iron Druid Chronicles'. It starts out with a different hook than most true, but what's more important is that it doesn't squander it. It is one of those rare debut series that comes damn close to living up to the originality of it's premise.    At the heart of the series is the titular druid himself, Atticus O'Sullivan. That, of course isn't his real name. When you've lived over two thousand years you probably go through more than a few aliases. That's especially important when you don't appear to age. For all that he is literally older than Christ (a fact that comes up in truly hilarious fashion) he appears to be about twenty-one years old. As the story opens he is living a low key life in Arizona, running a small bookstore and apothecary. As much as he is trying to stay off the supernatural radar, however, it's pretty much futile. When you're the last of the true druids, have an arrangement with the Celtic goddess of death, and possess the most dangerous magical sword on Earth you have to figure that your life is gonna be interesting.    The first book, Hounded, introduces Atticus and most of the supporting cast in fairly straightforward fashion. I will say that, despite having a vampire and a werewolf as his lawyers, and more than one goddess for an occasional lover, the character that most steals the show is Atticus' Irish wolfhound Oberon. Atticus can shapeshift into dog form and, even as a human, can speak with Oberon who gets some of the series best lines. Hearne cleverly uses the dog as comic relief, an aide to the minimal exposition needed, and to take the wind out of the sails of pretentious humankind (in a way that dog owners in particular will really get). Hounded is a very good book all in all, especially considering that it's a first novel. It is focused, funny, and original with really well thought out magic and action. The book also stays mostly focused on the Celtic mythology one would expect from a druidic character while hinting at a larger magical world.    Great beginning to the series and well worth the read.

B005ERIRZE|5.0|Will Power is an overused and poorly understand phenomenon.  The author uses realistic examples and clear, specific details about the body's chemistry as it interacts with our brains to enhance or frustrate our efforts at management of our will power.  She also uses many examples drawn fro the experiences of students in her classes.  Even if you have no difficulty with your own will power, this book gives you interesting insights into its place in the human psyche and the manner in which it functions.

So clever that I find myself re-reading sentences with admiration. Buy her terrific books so we can continue to enjoy one of the best writers I have ever had the pleasure of reading!
B004X75RK4|3.0|This movie starts out with a very rough professional relationship between two people. Both of them are not truly happy in their lives but they feel they are doing what they need to in order to succeed in life. They have good jobs, they are young, they are good looking. But as the movie progresses they run into a few problems, the main lead woman (Margaret) is told that she won't be able to have her job anymore because she is Canadian and her visa in order to work in the United States was denied. She then convinces her assistant (Andrew) to marry her in order to keep her job and therefore her happiness. Andrew agrees to do this only because she has threatened to take his job away if he does not help her. They go away for the weekend in order to tell Andrew's parents that they are getting married. The over arching theme of the weekend and therefore the movie is that in order to find true purpose in life you must find your significant other. The people in your life are the things that make life worthwhile, they make it worth doing anything, being in a certain job, loving someone that's in your life.<br />  God is not a part of family; He is not even a part of the movie. He does not get mentioned at all, the wedding that takes place does not happen in a church instead it happens in a barn. The only thing that is spiritual is the thanking of the \\"spirits\\" which is not taken seriously. It is given in a very comical light; the grandmother who is thanking the spirits is shown in a very humorous view. The only authority that is expressed within the movie is that of people and most of those that are in authority are expressed as unintelligent or uncaring. The only gods in this movie are money and self. The money is expressed through the success that the people try to attain through their jobs. The self is expressed in pretty much everything else that is happening, it is all about how does it make me feel what are the emotions that I am going through, what kind of emotions doothers make me feel. The media part of this movie has a couple of mixed messages. It does not give any value to God and what God's part in our lives is. He is not the authority He is not what gives us hope or a future through this movie. We only need to find the one that is going to love us for the rest of our lives; that should be our goal. We need to find love in those around them instead of in a relationship with God the Father.<br /> This movie is good art in my opinion. It has good technical excellence; it was well done with good acting and good writing of the script. The story is valid, there are a few stretching details that would be a little hard to believe at times but at the same time they could happen. The content is solid, it's a good story line and something that someone can get very easily caught up in. I find that this movie is good entertainment although we need to be careful about who we watch it with and what parts people are exposed to. There is one scene that is inappropriate for someone young and to be honest it's a bit inappropriate for anyone. It is very funny but at the same time it is two naked people to say it bluntly. The pair is completely nude, and the camera captures all but the most sensitive regions of their bodies throughout the scene. In essence, the filmmakers show us everything, while not showing quite everything. Because of this I'm not sure I would be able to endorse the entire movie, especially without some reservations.  I found that the love that Andrew and Margaret have for each other is completely unselfish. This is the kind of love that we should be having for one another. I would be able to put that into perspective and instead of two humans loving each other it would be God loving us. The love that He has for us is perfect and although sometimes the love that others have is self seeking we would never have to worry about that with Christ's love.
0307341577|5.0|extremely gifted and insightful writer! character development is unsurpassed. We can only hope that Gillian Flynn is as prolific as she is talented.
0345803485|5.0|No pre-conceptions or judgments before reading the book so enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a ROMANTIC, erotic fiction - does not try to be anything other than that.
B007G5GYHA|1.0|We didn't finish it. Even my 3 yo said,\\" Mommy, I don't like this movie.\\" So, we turned it off.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|just downloaded the game a few days ago and so far so good. it is very addicting. when i get stuck on a level my kids love to challenge me. this is a great family game for all ages. my four year old likes to play some of the games.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are gorgeous and I love creating my little village. To avoid accidental charges I just turn off wifi before I start. Especially if my son is playing. Presto no surprise charges parents! (I saw people complaing about this.) plus your kindle battery last longer with wifi off! I have not bought anything extra yet and I see no need to as you can earn all you need eventually. I also have no trouble exiting the game, from the options menu you can access the bar with the arrow and your settings up top! I highly recommend this game!
0307454568|5.0|This book is engaging and thrilling. The characters jump out at you and the author does an excellent job at putting a lot of details into the book.

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|i love this game but when it sais kindle fire edition doesnt that mean the notifications should work? and also it restarts me saying im using more than one device. i love this game but why do we have to wait so long for kindle fire apps when androids already have them months prior to us. get with the program and please fix this. thanks!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is so awesome I love the way it makes you fell like your actually running your own restaurant
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Im not a big reader but read these books in a week. It was a fast read and the pages were flying. I loved it!!! Only bad thing it now I have nothing to read.
0345803485|3.0|This book was so talked about that as I finished the Hunger Games Series, I dove right in to this one. I don't know where to start.... It is ok. I personally think we could do without all the \\"cleverly written kinky sexy details\\" because frankly they are not that well written.  This book has actually benefited me in the sense that I am going to begin writing my own book because now, I have been first hand witness to the fact that if this book is selling I KNOW I can do at least this good.<br />So in summary, if you like steamy harlequin type novels that push the limits of decency this is the book for you. I am going to read all 3 books, no matter what since they are making a movie...<br />but the characters are wanting, and the story does not flow as it should.  Ms. Steele is written as both a strong understanding mature beyond her years woman, and a naive virgin, and additionally someone who suffers from multiple personality disorder holding conversations with her \\"inner Goddess\\". I need a scorecard to keep up because these changes in personality are page by page not chapter by chapter.<br /><br />I honestly wish I was not reading this mess but I am not a quitter and I update my review accordingly as I finish the series.<br /><br />laters baby.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I was sooooooooooo waiting for this to appear on the kindle. Thank you. Had it on iphone but gave me problems after update. Hopefully the same does not happen this time.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Great game... but lv33, should be well prepared.<br />If you don't have a plan, then it's horrible to defeat.<br /><br />Except for the balancing issue, it's great game
B000SVXQL6|5.0|So, my mom who owns this account, bought me this album. I can't believe I finally got it at the lowest price for it's astonishing quality! The person who sold it to us was tomsqualitymusic: which who i think is by far one of the most trustworthy amazon sellers. When I put this on my record player, I couldn't believe the quality of the music! The song Halo of flies just blew me away! If you are planning on buying a killer album here, paying a little extra is worth it!

Great job and I'm hoping the story doesn't end at the third book.

1596432594|2.0|There is nothing particularly bad about Feynman by Jim Ottaviani and Leland Myrick.  The issue is that the comic biography does not really bring anything new to the table.  Richard Feynman's life is something that has already been extensively documented, most notabely in his the subject's own books, [[ASIN:0393316041 Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character)]]and [[ASIN:B004OA6KIS \\"What Do You Care What Other People Think?\\": Further Adventures of a Curious Character]].  Mr. Feynman's lectures are available in books, on web sites and even on youtube.<br /><br />Feynman (the graphic novel) is a very accurate retelling of his life story.  It hits all the major points of his education, his career and his thoughts on physics and quantum mechanics.  The authors include bits from several of his lectures and do a good job showing the quirkiness of the character.  They, however, do not fully capitalize on the comic form. This could have been an opportunity to try and illustrate many of Feynman's revelations.  Instead, during a lecture the reader gets an illustration of the protagonist lecturing!  Biography can always trend a bit more toward's tell rather than show, but as a graphic novel this approach makes for poor sequential art.<br /><br />If you want to read about a great physicist and need to do with heavy graphic elements then this book is right for you.  Otherwise, just dive in to the already existing fantastic prose work about Mr. Feynman.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|A lot of action packed scenes from this movie...just had to watch again and have as part of collection. Kind of reminds us of the series of 'Bourne Identity' but in a different angle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|have not had a single problem using on my kindle.  got it for my mom's nook &amp; again it works perfectly.
B000A2IPPK|4.0|Really enjoyed watching this movie since we were younger and now seeing that this could be part of my DVD collection makes it nice to know that our kids could grow up enjoying this also.

B00338QENI|5.0|It feels like I may be the last person to read Rebecca Skloot's The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, a New York Times Bestseller now out in paperback (which is how I picked it up: on an impulse-buy sale table at a bookstore).<br /><br />The book, which took Skloot over ten years to research and write, tells the complicated story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor black woman treated for cervical cancer in the early 1950s, whose cancer cells were taken for research without her knowledge or consent and gave rise to much of the medical research we take for granted today, including cancer research, vaccine research, etc. The cells are still bought and sold, and Lacks' family had no idea any of this was going on for over twenty years -- until researchers began to wonder about the person the cells came from.<br /><br />Skloot tells the story by going back and forth in time: from present time to when the story about where the cells came from was first breaking, to when Henrietta was still alive and the research was first occurring. Some may balk at the presentation of Lacks' family: many still live in poverty, without education, and have had multiple run-ins with the law. Others may be frustrated at the lack of detailed explanation of the science behind the cell research, and want Skloot to have delved into this area more.<br /><br />What Skloot has done, however, is provide an overview that makes it easy for most to understand the complicated area of ethics when it comes to medical research. The juxtaposition of Lacks' family's current position vs. the multi-billion-dollar corporations that have been built on the back of the HeLa research should be enough to make any reader wonder.<br /><br />Having participated in medical research as a subject, and knowing what now goes into informed consent compared to what happened to Henrietta Lacks (and other \\"studies\\" mentioned in the book like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment), its amazing to see how far the medical industry has come in just sixty years -- and how much further it has to go.<br /><br />There may be readers who want more details about cell research or other types of medical research after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, or who wished that the parts about Lacks' family were omitted, but with the number of uninsured Americans we have in the face of a huge medical industry (of which I am one), I think the social commentary is one worth looking at beyond just the science.ust sixty years -- and how much further it has to go.<br /><br />There may be readers who want more details about cell research or other types of medical research after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, or who wished that the parts about Lacks' family were omitted, but with the number of uninsured Americans we have in the face of a huge medical industry (of which I am one), I think the social commentary is one worth looking at beyond just the science.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is my first Sparks book and I loved it.  Spoilers  Logan - in post war stress - healed himself by walking across the country and pledging help to the one person he thought saved him through the war - was romance at its best.  So the fact that he wasn't romantically obsessed with her before he met her - but grew alongside her with their relationship made this read far more realistic than most.  I'm searching for another of Mr. Sparks books tonight.  I loved the movie and loved loved loved this novel.  Well done, well written.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|the game is addicting and fun you have to just defend the town from different zombies and have different power ups to help you.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fantastic game - great music, challenging puzzles, elegant interface, smooth controls. terrific app. using on a500 tablet w.ice cream sandwich.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I am almost half way through this game,  and have not used any hints. I played quell reflections first and that's a lot harder. I hope this will get more challenging soon. I started a new job that requires I think steps ahead of what I am doing. Since I have been playing these games I think it has helped me focus a bit more on thinking ahead.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Loved it, I'm over 60 and thoroughly enjoyed, exciting, started the next book.  Looking forward to continuing this story.  Hard to put down.
B007IFZU5A|5.0|This is an album that requires multiple listens in order to get the most out of it. It's not \\"immediate\\" - no real radio singles here, as if PL ever really wanted that in the first place - and I think that's a good thing. The album starts out \\"really good\\" and then continues to get better from there.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother comparing this to their older albums: \\"Draconian Times,\\" \\"Icon,\\" (probably) \\"Gothic\\" are all considered classics for good reason. But...those albums clearly had their roots in death metal. This album is in the heavier vein they re-embraced on their self-titled album, and that continued through \\"In Requiem\\" and \\"Faith Divides Us...\\" - if you liked those albums, you'll probably like this album. Those albums, and \\"Tragic Idol,\\" are not death metal in any way. This album, like the recent others, is heavy music with a goth/doom feel to it...which is perfectly fine by me.<br /><br />I dig this album...a lot.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Awesome that they have this for kindle but it still has the have the bugs worked out. Like right now my kindle is stuck in landscape and wont change untill I reset it. also games keep restarting themselves. still worth getting.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great! I absolutely love it. Its so much fun.<br />Fun for all ages. You must try it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm an adult and I have been glued to this game since I started playing it, I guess I'm gonna let my 8yr old daughter play. Lol!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|cool cool cool cool cool cool absolutley I always wanted to play this game with my friends but kindle edition wasn't in the app store this is so much more fun than sketch with friends considering that this one is much cooler and the other one you're with random people so definitely getting this app is a plus ;)
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I don't usually read science fiction. Sci-fis are usually a bit esoteric for me. This was different. The story was well structured & flowed easily. It was a good read. I'm looking forward to reading book 2 of the trilogy next.
B005723JSQ|2.0|I read the Sample of this book and was totally hooked so I bought it.  I was so happy to read about a character who was fun, easy going and could start dancing in front of strangers singing \\"Mr. Yamasaki\\" LOL! Thought it was hillarious and was really looking forward to read the rest of the book ... But to my surprise, that was the ONLY part of the book I laughed and Poppy was not a fun character at all.  I kept reading - because I already pay for the book, not because it was interesting - and kind of understood why she was so insecure, but sometimes I just wanted to slap her in the face and tell her \\"wake up, stand for yourself, you are 29, not 19!\\".  Then I saw small changes in her personality the more she talked to Sam and thought \\"Finally!\\" when she confronted the people she should, only to see everything crumble at the end of chapter 15 and the last chapter.  SUCH A DISAPPOINTING reading!  The author sure could have written something so much better than THAT last chapter! It was painful to read, Poppy was insecure, needy and stupid again.  I just didn't get it at all!<br /><br />Like I said, I felt ripped off, I think I pay way too much for this book.  So sad cause the ending could have been written so much better and make it kind of funny, something the rest of the book lacks.  Also the characters could had been better described so we can love them and missed them when the book ended, which happens to me almost all the time I finished a book, but in this case I was glad I was done.  Really, don't waste your money on this one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|my kindle is under my dads name and he can see every thing I purchase and so far I have gotten a lot of apps and uninstalled a lot so I don't know if I should get this even if I love it half to death. I don't want to be annoying to him or you!! HELP!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in our Stars is a beautifully written emotional roller coaster book, one page I was laughing the next one I was crying ... and not a couple of tears, crying my eyes out! Not that I like to cry a lot while reading, but this is an Amazing story of life, death and love.  It definitely give you a perspective.  I love this book and I really recommend it.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|The 2Cellos CD is excellent! We saw them in concert with Elton John and they were awesome! We really enjoy listening to this CD and will be purchasing more by this artist! Enjoy!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Great storyline.  Great graphics. A really fun game. Can't. wait to try more of your games. Will recommend to all my friends.

B004AFFZNI|5.0|I love this little camera, and with this housing, it is very easy to attach/remove cables. It's the same quality as all the other Hero products, and it matches perfectly with the GoPro. The more accessories I have with the GoPro, the more versatile it becomes. Better to have it when you need it than to regret a purchase you passed up.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I see no reason to waste my time for this type of null applications. I wonder how it got 4.5 stars and I see only one or two stars recently.

B0040JHLM2|5.0|I am on my third pair of Brooks and cannot say enough good about them.  I run about 25 to 30 miles per week on average, weigh about 190 pounds and get about 350 miles per pair before I replace.  I could probably get more miles out of these shoes, but find that the feeling of a fresh shoe every 3 to 4 months refreshing.  I have used numerous other shoes, and with other brands had issues with knee pain, shin splints etc.  I have never experienced any of these things with the Brooks.  They are extremely comfortable for both hard surface and trail running.  I always buy the previous edition GTS 11 vs. GTS 12.  Over the course of a year, the price savings allows me to rotate my shoes more often for the same money which is more important to me than having the latest model.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|the only problem is the fact that I can only have 15 games going with the free version so a normal person would buy the paid version but since I'm logged in with facebook it said that I have to be 16 years of age stupid right

B005KR6OBM|5.0|This is a good show and I'm glad I bought these dvd's. I'm looking forward to the season 5 to be put out. Great deal through Amazon.
0375826726|5.0|I have loved this series since book one. I see that there is a lot of hate for this series. I can see why. It is predictable in most of its broad story movements. What keeps me going here is I love the moral dilemmas that the characters endure. Put simply I love the characters from this series. That is why this series appeals to me so much. They grow, they learn, they have become my friends.<br /><br />This one is a lot more violent than the last two. It makes this book a lot more brutal than Eldest and Eragon. I felt the stakes were higher.<br /><br />I can tell that he has grown as a writer. This isn't the same kid that wrote Eragon. I know this series fails to please everybody. It does please me. Can't wait to start book four and see what fate has in store for my friends.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|A very well done classic tale of Achilles, and the Trojan wars of ancient Greek legend.  Not for the pacifist.  No good rationale for war either.  The story of \\"El Cid\\" is far superior as it was based on a Christian ethic for war, set during the dark ages of Spain.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|I love everything overall, the only issue I have is the night vision isn't quite as clear as I would like.  Everything else though is fantastic.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|The forth in the series, this should really have come before \\"Fireproof\\".  Just as classic as \\"Flywheel\\" and \\"Facing the Giants\\" this unambiguously Christian video was turned into a cultic program for evangelicals.  That was a mistake.  It does fit nicely into a general scheme of life for men, however.  Watch it with men and boys only - chicks do not belong in the audience.  Own the set.  But remember, these videos are for men and boys.
B004ADV552|5.0|Recorded the same year as his earllier Masterpiece, [[ASIN:B000UB073Y Tenor Madness]], Rollins hits another one out of the park with this album.<br /><br />The line-up here is completely different from Tenor Madness, with Tommy Flanagan on piano, Doug Watkins on bass and Max Roach on drums. Watkins is a bassist to whom I pay close attention, which makes this album all the more valuable to me. He was Charles Mingus choice to replace himself (so he could play piano) on [[ASIN:B00124DPV4 Oh Yeah (US Release)]], and had Watkins not died at 27 he had the potential to be one of jazz's top bassists.<br /><br />Of course Saint Thomas is the reason most non-jazz aficionados love this album, but my personal favorites are Moritat (also known as Mack the Knife) and Blue 7. However, personal favorites aside, I hold every track on this album to be a masterpiece. Not a bad effort for a 26 year old who had previously that year made a landmark album that would be hard to top.<br /><br />This album (and Tenor Madness) should be in every jazz lovers library, and is so beautifully crafted that any music lover - jazz or otherwise - should enjoy it.

0307951529|5.0|At one point Chris G. offered this course (which is now his book) on his website.  Pamela Slim, from Escape From Cubicle Nation helped him out with the course.  I absolutely adore the work that Chris does (or doesn't do) traveling the world, and I do mean Kris-krossing it from one nation to another to Timbuktu.  I'm not sure there is a place left on earth Chris hasn't explored.  I love reading his blog and if you get this book you should definitely check out his blog, too.  The course and the book were really very simple, no nonsense ways of creating a little bit of income on the side and not spending very much money at all to get started.  Chris provides seven steps to marketability to test out if your passion/skills/idea will hit the mark.  Over and over again Chris stresses that you should provide something that is useful over innovative.  You don't have to create the next McDonald's you just have to figure out a little something that a few others are interested in, too.<br /><br />Primary takeaways - find out what your passion/interest/skills/ideas are.  Find something useful in there.  Run it against the steps to marketability.  Start small, start cheap, start NOW.<br /><br />I think you will love this book.  It is a simple, efficient and nicely illustrated guide to your first start-up.<br /><br />Finally, I think it is rather important that Chris didn't just write this book, he 1000% walks this walk.  Or rather, travels this globe!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Over the past couple of months this book has been gaining popularity, so I decided to try it. At first I didn't think I would like it because it isn't really the genre I go for but once I got into the third chapter, I was hooked. Christian Grey doesn't just capture Ana's heart in this book but he tugs at every women's need to be the light of a mans world. Now, even though I can say I truly loved this book I will not admit to it being perfect. The writing is sometimes repetitive and some may say there is too much sex but that is just a personal preference. All in all this is a guilty pleasure, this is what you read when you just want to feel good. This is not the kind of book you take and make literary analysis on, this is the type of book you devour and obsess over because it reaches you in a level that you only dare fantasize about.
0765342294|4.0|Great book. You should check it out. Got it for my little sister as part of her required reading in class.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is as advertised. I'm sure it is not for everybody. I think the book is very well written and the author keeps us interested all the way through and I'm ready for the 2nd in the series.

B004EPYZUS|2.0|Boring is the first word that comes to mind after watching this film. The acting is mediocre, the script is so cliche (Russians missile codes and the threat of nuclear war again?! Oye Veigh!) as to make one laugh. It fizzled as quickly as it began. The first three Mission Impossible movies were very good, but clearly the creators of this blaze film did not know when to stop.

1469984202|2.0|The story moves along in a very long winded method.  Is it a good yarn, sometimes, but seems to go on forever.  One never finds out exactly the reason the people ended up where they are.  Well, vaguely the author recounts some of the builders reasoning.  The main character is unbelievable as a person as are most of the other characters.  The five star rating is not realistic in my opinion.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I think I paid $2.99 for this Kindle book.  What a great deal and a great book.  I'm really glad books 1-5 were combined, made for a much better experience.  This could easily be a stand alone book but could also be a series---hoping for the latter!  I was really into it from the beginning and was not disappointed anywhere along the way.  Keep them coming Mr. Howey.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Not much to add other than that Day is a master of thought provoking erotica. I've read several of her books and this was the best one yet. I'm so upset the sequel isn't available yet!
B0071K5KWU|5.0|Another great work from Mr. Banks into a classical world. There are two pieces with solo works (Siren - Sax solo & Blade - Violin solo) that sounds epic themes and shows the great ability of Mr. Banks in terms of create  fantastic atmospheres. He is a genius.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Loved playing this game.  can always go back and improve your score.  music very nice to listen to.  Wish you could use just one or two hint coins if you get stuck part way through.
B004X75RK4|1.0|I am confused. I did not rent or purchase this product... movie or DVD I guess! So why are you asking me to review it... Please check your records and if you have charged me for this... please correct and credit back my $$$$$$.  Gee, guess I should have labeled this \\" review of your system\\"... bahahaha.
0439023483|5.0|CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK MORE! Couldn't put it down till I read all three. Now that I'm done with them I've given them to my mother to read and have three other people waiting to read them after. Was SO bummed when I was done with them. Cannot wait to re-read them. 5*!!
B000TGJ8IU|3.0|It's too bad that you can not receive TROY in MVC FULL HI-DEF. Yes, it Hi-DEF..but NOT FULL HD..there lies the rub for me...NO DTS, NO 1080P/24 frames...TOO BAD...<br />All the other jive included with the Director's Edition with fancy packaging and pictures, even though pictures of Diane Kruger is worth the buy, leaves me ripped off by the studio...
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit ninjas is one of the best free games I've ever played. I've completed all the backgrounds and swords plus I can play it anywhere because it doesn't need wick. YAY. it doesn't have much adds. fruit ninjas free is awesome
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Don't get me wrong but this app is okay ya some of the games are fun but of you get frustrated easy then don't get this app. :-)
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I just finished The Innocent and didn't want the book to be over.  A great book with with a lot of action and wonderful cast of characters.  Will Robie is the ultimate hit-man for the US government and gets caught up in situation he's never faced before. THrough a series of events he hooked up with 14 year old Julie who has just seen her parents murdered.  The plot is intense with a lot of twists and turns.  I had the \\"bad\\" guy narrowed down to two people but couldn't figure the how and why until the end of the book when we find out who the bad \\"guy\\" actually is.  This is a great read if you are looking for a page turning book with great characters and an intense plot.  I hope we see more books with Robie and Julie.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its just like super Mario of course with its occasional glitches . nothing like a new version of a classic game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books i've read in a long time.  I am now in yhe middle of book 2 and have already bought book 3.
1466401885|4.0|I read this in two nights... Well worth the money..... Was looking for a roller coaster read after fifty shades......this was a good choice.
B005ELZNH0|5.0|5 stars, clearly, for the music - it is Miles Davis, after all. Basically this set gathers naerly all of Davis' Columbia studio albums and adds two live sets (\\"Miles in Berlin\\" and \\"We Want Miles\\"). I'd have traded the 1980s studio albums \\"Decoy\\" & \\"Star People\\" for \\"Miles in the Sky\\" & the stunning-in-its-omission \\"Milestones\\" (the other missing pre-1980 studio albums are are \\"Quiet Nights\\" and \\"Sorcerer\\"). The CDs, each in a well-produced cardboard replica of the original album cover, include the bonus tracks that their regular-issue CDs include. No inner sleeves means the CDs will fall out of their covers if handled incautiously. Quibbles aside, a truly outstanding value for the price and very highly recommended. Note: the album listed in the description as \\"Miles\\" is \\"1958 Miles\\", the Japanese issue of the Columbia LP \\"Jazz Tracks\\" minus the \\"Lift to the Scaffold\\" tracks (i.e. the equivalent of the U.S. release \\"'58 Sessions\\".
B0018QQQK8|5.0|First of all, I love to relax with a good book to read on those lazy days and Nicholas Sparks has so many great books. As I began reading, my gosh, I couldnt put the book down! It was so good and what I loved the most was that it was so easy to purchase the book from Amazon.com Its a secure website and you never have to worry about buying from it. Its an easy way to shop for yourself or for others!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was a really good read. I got a little upset at the ending, but it served it's purpose because I immediately ordered the next book. I would highly recommend this book to both the young and the young hearted readers.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is SO FUN!!!! It is my favorite game out of all of the apps I have. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is very entertaining. hours of fun for all! Only wish there was more mini games to play other than kung tu scrat!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All 3 books were amazing.  I read them all in 3 days.  Such a good dark romance.  Makes you hot and uncomfortable and so in love at the same time.  Highly recommended!
B0036S4CTS|3.0|Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew are almost lovers, sort of friends, and inseparable since college.  As predictable with any male-female relationship filled with sexual tension but no actual relationship, their unspoken feelings for each other eventually ruins every relationship they have but at least they always have each other to fall back on.<br /><br />There is something charming about Em and Dex's relationship, maybe it's the `falling in love with your best friend' dynamic that comes out in bursts throughout the book or maybe I'm just a sucker for a decent romance.  The story is told only in snippets as Nicholls gives you only one day of their relationship each year.  Surprisingly enough this does not leave any gaps in the plot and you get a very full picture of the love-hate relationship of Em-n-Dex.  Their relationship feels real.  It's not a sugar-sweet romance like you'd find in a Nicholas Sparks novel, nor is it a torrid affair like you'd find in \\"chick lit.\\"  In fact,  I don't think I'd even call this book `chick-lit' it's sort of in a league of its own.  A real life romance-drama maybe.<br /><br />Even though the relationship feels real there is something a little off about this novel.  I felt for Emma's character, but Dexter remained the kind of guy I just couldn't bring myself to care about.  The heartbreaking but predictable from the first few chapters ending did not leave me feeling the way it should have and left me finishing the book disappointed.  This not quite chick-lit, not quite literary book isn't quite what I'd hoped it would be.<br /><br />That being said it does tell the story of a very real-life almost romance and because of how well Nicholls keeps his characters from being characters the book is worth reading if only because of how unique it is by being totally ordinary.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|Beautifully shot film... Somewhat dark and sleek \\"New York yuppie working in the city\\" feel film well portrayed by Michael Fassbender who gives a commendable and daring performance.<br /><br />I have always loved complex characters and films that takes their time to develop them. Although its pretty clear the lead character is somewhat of a player who lives a yuppie lifestyle, it will ultimately dawn on you that this is a deeply flawed individual with sex addiction who is left unchecked and unrestrained in his desires which the film very tactfully avoids being to obvious about until towards the end.<br /><br />In recent years, we can see these new genre of darker films emerging where leads are no longer required to be likable or even perfect. I wouldn't even define it as an \\"anti heroe\\" movie.<br /><br />Some films you watch for its story and some films you watch for its beauty, for me its defintely the latter where great modern camera work can be seen in every scene of the film with great play on colors, bokeh and movement in the shots.<br /><br />A modern film with a modern plot which will bring you along on a ride into the down spiral of its character's actions and moral struggles...
B000LPS4BG|3.0|Martin Scorsese makes great films is an obvious statement. What may not be obvious to the casual shopper is that the Goodfellas blu ray is a bad transfer. At one point during the movie, a vertical line cuts through the picture. In another, the an echo distorts the sound and makes the dialog sound like it has been fed through a Speak and Spell. Granted, these flaws are superficial. They do not change the plot and are only present for a small fraction of the run time. However, when one is paying for the \\"HD\\" experience, they deserve a film that has been given some manner of care in the transfer process. The movie gets five stars. The disk knocks the product down to three.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|I do not view this film particularly as a film about educational systems. I do however feel that its more of an over-the-top depressing depiction in a fictional story about the complexity of human suffering that exist in our world today.<br /><br />Its a story about a teacher being tortured by his own past (Brody) crossing paths with people and students/ youths with failing families and problematic parenting. This mellow paced film makes me think, if all mankind can act like Brody's character; while amidst his own issues, he still tries his best to be good and contributing in his own little way, i think our world would be a much better place.<br /><br />The irony here is that the more his good intentions thats he puts forth towards people reciprocates, the more he struggles to push them away, due to his fear of commitment as with his job and relationships. This story really has multiple layers in its characters and so many complex messages, its not easy to description in a shot review. One great underlaying message worth mentioning is that a good deed needs to be followed through and not abandoned once undertaken.<br /><br />The story establishes great character development and builds empathy for its characters effectively. Great casting, great acting aspecially the story between Adrien Brody and Sami Gayle. Adrien in his usual depressed fashion really excels when put in the right roles. Sami made me root for the innocent little girl for abit who obviously comes from a tragic or non existent upbringing.<br /><br />Excellent film.  A+++<br />Highly recommended. If the film \\"Never let me go\\" blew you away. You'll like this film like i did.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is my favorite &amp; most used  app. I use it for everything. It's my mental dump yard. The best thing about it is I can enter information on 1 device &amp; access it on any other device.
159514188X|5.0|I love dark books, not because I'm a dark person, but because they're easy to read. When I say easy to read, I don't mean that they don't cause pain and emotion, I mean that you can't put them down without pushing yourself to do so. This is one of those books. Anyone can relate to it, it makes you wonder if you know anyone going through struggles, people who are hiding their true feelings. I strongly recommend this book. Its one of my all time favorites, I've read it multiple times, it doesn't get old. If you're looking for a book that makes you question the people around you, or even question your role in those around you, this is the perfect book for you!
B005ER2RIW|3.0|I enjoyed this as a book, and it would certainly be nice to have if you happened to have an emergency, but I was overall disappointed.  A lot of subjects could have been covered in more depth, and I ended up losing a bit of faith in the author as an expert. He gave the impression of being a bit behind-the-times, and that the information he presented is aimed for a military unit from the 1960s that is carrying survival kits.<br /><br />There were some topics I wish he had covered which he didn't, and others which were too short.  He spends some time on identifying wild plants for use as food (on the kindle, this section is useless due to lack of color), and it's a lot of material, but since it tries to cover the whole world, it's actually quite thin. Maybe it's better to leave this out and just let the reader buy a plant guidebook. A similar comment applies to some first-aid materials. I  know that first-aid standards change very fast (e.g. they change the recommendations for CPR every 5 years), and I think his section on lightning was a bit out-of-date but it's hard to blame him since this info changes fast.  Since he didn't go into much depth on most first-aid and since the recommendations change periodically, I would recommend leaving the first-aid out of the book and letting the reader buy a dedicated first-aid book written by a doctor.<br /><br />There are a few \\"Survival Scenario\\" interludes that are not interesting. For example, \\"Survival scenario: what should you do in a country where the threat of kidnap is high? [answer] ... the best thing to do is to be a 'grey' person... so that you don't stand out. If there's a rescue attempt, get down and take cover.\\"  That is fantastic advice, but it's also common sense that most people don't need to read in a book.<br /><br />The author also has some \\"Case Studies\\" that are similarly not-so-useful. These could have been the most entertaining part of the book, but they are bland and basically consist of examples wheregroups make poor decisions (the psychology of groups and small explorer/climber/military parties is for sure an interesting topic and there is much written on it, but this book doesn't go into it beyond some common-sense ideas). Mainly the case studies serve to show the age of the material (one case study is from the author training an army unit in Kenya in the mid 60s; another is about a monsoon in Borneo in 1963 that left his unit without supplies, so they ate snails).<br /><br />The writing style isn't impressive, and despite being a book with many revisions, there are some ungrammatical sentences.<br /><br />The book has interesting stuff, but my overall recommendation is to find something more modern.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Been addicted to this game for almost a week now. You can get pretty far on this game without buying gold coins. Yeah! I love Samurais and Zombies, and having them both is wicked sweet.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|Do you really want to hear Sgt. Pepper?  Over the years you may have heard a lot of people---including all of the Beatles except Paul---say it wasn't that special, or have some kind of complaint about it.  I felt the same way;  for me there's a 7 minute \\"gap\\" in (waht was) side two, namely \\"When I'm 64\\" and the biggest bomb on the album \\"Lovely Rita.\\"<br /><br />Some of you know the story, but for those who don't, it was George Martin and Capitol Records that messed up Sgt. Pepper.  The Beatles began work on the album in December 1966.  Before Christmas Capitol came around insisting they have a Beatles single for Christmas.  At that time all they had in the can was \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" and \\"64.\\"  They should have told Capitol to screw off, but instead Martin dutifully gave them the \\"Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields\\" single.  In those days the Beatles didn't put singles on their albums.  American fans remember the sliced and diced American versions of the records---which did include the singles.  But in the case of Sgt. Pepper it was released in America as it was in Britain---without the single.  And so the album has a massive hole.<br /><br />If you really want to hear Pepper the way it should have been arrange the album on your computer/cd player, etc.  so that \\"64\\" and \\"Lovely Rita\\" are out, and \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" ---- in that order, in their place.  Suddenly, you are now faced with perhaps the best Beatles album ever made.  You won't believe how the opening chords of \\"Strawberry Fields\\" sound AFTER \\"Within You Without You\\" goes out.  \\"Penny Lane\\" sounds fantastic after that, and \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" sounds even better and more appropriate coming after \\"Penny Lane.\\"  In fact it sounds like what it started out to be, an album about their childhood.  That's how I have my copy of Sgt. Pepper set up on my computer.  I never listen to it the other way anymore.<br /><br />And of course you can leave in the offending songs if you like them, play with the running order, etc.  But Sgt. Pepper without \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields\\" really is a day without the life.<br />Will Hemmings

0345803485|1.0|This is a poorly written book, from what I read of it. The book lacks a plot and strong central theme. The author was clearly looking for a \\"shock\\" factor, she does, but overall the book is crap and not worthy of it's present rating.
0812550706|5.0|I'm surprised it took me this long to get around to this book.  I think part of the reason is how heavily marketed this book is as science fiction rather than a Bildungsroman story.  One of my friends said it was required reading at her high school, which I think is a great idea.  Although in retrospect some of the plot twists seem like they should have been obvious, the author develops the story so well that you don't even notice.  Highly recommend this book.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|was fun till it kept setting my buildings to like 300 hours till they are ready. only way to fix it is delete buildings and re buy them.  I am done with it..

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I bought this watch despite reading some reviews about how the touch bevel was a pain.. I'm happy to say I haven't had any problems with it. I use the \\"bevel lock\\" function during the runs, which prevents it from accidentally being activated, and this works great. I don't find the need to use the touch buttons on the bevel during runs, so it's not a problem. Using the bevel at other times is fine. If you have used an old-school ipod with the circular touch pad, it is pretty similar. It is not the best design idea, but if you are comfortable using things like the ipod touchwheel you won't have problems with this.<br />The watch works well; it is accurate, locates a GPS signal very quickly, and syncs seamlessly with my Mac. For the sale price on this watch (~$180) it is a great deal. The features on it are comparable with a more expensive Garmin, and it comes with a HR monitor and alternative wrist strap. The extra wrist strap, a cloth and velcro (instead of plastic) version is MUCH more comfortable and allows the watch to fit snugly. I have small wrists and with the velcro strap, I can get the watch to fit perfectly. I found the HR monitor is too big, even when fully tightened, for smaller people (30-32' chest), but I just tuck it under the elastic band of my sports bra and it stays on snugly that way.<br />Would definitely recommend, especially to those who are comfortable with touch screen functions.<br />If you have any other specific questions on it, post and I'd be happy to respond.
B004EPZ034|5.0|I have been watching The chipmunks since the 60's and to have these movies about the Chipmunks is absolutely great.  The movie got here fast and in great shape.  Thanks a bunch.

0345803485|5.0|I absolutely love this series. Couldn't put it down, read till 4 in the morning! Naughty but nice. Can't wait for the newest book.
0345803493|3.0|Maybe it's me. I just feel like there were so many parts that were exactly the same in the first book. She bites her lip, they do it, they send playful emails and then do it only to go and do it again. This book had a bit more of a story line (or attempt at one) although it's written in the same easy way as the first book. We do learn more and more about Christian and it's mostly a very predictable story line but with a little cute twist that is very Nora Roberts like. The sex parts aren't the bad part of this book as many say it's honestly the lack of character development and level of writing. If you LOVED the first book you'll LIKE the second. If you thought the first book was a poor attempt at something engaging then you'll roll your eyes (just as Ana and Christian do in every chapter) through this entire book.  Have fun reading but just borrow this one from a friend.<br /><br />(I apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors).
B007G5GYHA|5.0|Very funny movie. it got a little slow towards the middle, but definitely worth watching.  My wife and I dont have any small children anymore but loved the character from Shrek, so we decided to give it try.  Definitely recommend 'baking' before viewing.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|addictive game. tho it would be nice if it was easier to get acorns, coins,  and finish families. also easy to use.
B0073Q0IY2|4.0|decent schlock...if there's nothing better to watch, this is pretty good. Slightly better than the first one. I'll give it a c+
B003Y5H574|1.0|What a disappointment.  Okay, so the mistaken identity stuff near the end was sort of clever, but overall this movie stinks.  The ending was especially horrible.  Who thought it was funny for a 17-year-old girl to hand naked pictures of herself to a 13-year-old boy that she caught masturbating (with her in mind), pictures she'd originally taken to give to the boy's father?  Really???  Have we really become that stupid and crass that we think this is humorous??  Even beyond that, the script is awful and some of the \\"plot twists\\" are just dumb.  The scene with the boy's speech at his eighth grade graduation was nauseatingly forced and fake.  I heard so much about this movie, and it turned out to be a total waste.  Don't bother.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|This movie was awful. Completely unbelievable and lame. Here are some of the MAIN reasons why this was stupid!<br /><br />1.)  Liam write a letter to his EX with an old school fountain pen.  Really? He is in the middle of Alaska and hes using a fountain pen?<br />He saves this letter in his pocket.....THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br />2.) Plane crashes and Liam furiously double belts himself in during its descent, yet after the crash he finds himself thrown from the wreckage, unscathed and not in the seat somehow even though he double belted himself in?<br />3.)  Liam finds the seat that was in front of him (where he put that letter before the plane went to Hell)he was in somehow in the multitude of crazy burned bodies, debris, etc.  and recovers that letter written in ink....yet this letter is completely legible, he puts it in his pocket for safe keeping..<br />4.) Wolves actually are MAD at these people, so they are in the middle of Alaska, killing them out of anger and not eating them? really?  give me a break.<br />5.)  A wolf was actually eating someone (before they realized they were mad) next to a fire, yet now fire scares these wolves away?<br />6.)  Liam pulls out that letter in the snow, yet still the ink hasnt run and the letter is in perfect codition.<br />7.) So they run from the wolves, come to a 200 FT high cliff...manage to jump to a tree...descend the tree......yet these same wolves somehow made it 200FT down and across a freezing cold river in 3 minutes so they could attack one of the survivors? Really? So wolves can now fly?<br />8.)  Liam and his last buddy fall into a freezing river, his buddy somehow gets his foot trapped in a way just not possible given the current...<br />9.) After being soaked in the river, Liam pulls out that letter again..somehow its dry and legible STILL.....WTF?<br />10.) Plane crahses, guy still has glasses on, perfectly intact somehow. BUT BUT he loses them while crawling on a rope with a slight breeze....reallllllllllly??????<br />11.)  So Liam makes a point to retrieve all the wallets of the killed to honor them and for their families. Its hilarious that EVERYONE has a wallet packed with family photos that are truly sentimental.  This is important so Liam can look at them before he stacks them into a neat pile while the Alpha Wolf patiently watches him (while growling ferociously with yellow eyes) from 30 feeet away.  \\"Grrrr Grrrr.....I will let this man reflect on his and other's lives before I kill him....grrr....grrrrr\\"<br />Save yourself time and watch a werewolf movie.<br />12) I can go on and on here,,this is one of the worst movies of the year....easily...<br /><br />The director obviously thought that having Liam was enough.....and assumed that the viewers are stupid.  Wolves dont act like this towards humans and they surely dont kill and NOT eat when there is basically NO food around them.  If you liked this movie, I suggest you view it again and add to my list.  :)r />11.)  So Liam makes a point to retrieve all the wallets of the killed to honor them and for their families.

B005IU1OMA|5.0|This Blu-ray contains beautiful backcountry footage. I am a sucker for snowboarding videos, so I was looking forward to watching one of the relatively few options available on BD. For some reason most are still DVD. The backcountry footage is great; therefore, if you are looking for a part oriented film you will be disappointed. In terms of video film quality, this is the #1 snowboard video I have ever seen. In terms of riding shots and pure entertainment, I'd rank this BD high, but still lower than other snowboard films like TB9 (totally board 9). If you are a snowboard fan I highly recommend buying this BD. It played just fine on my PS3.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is the free Kindle edition of an assortment of Sherlock adventures.  It is an interesting read, and typical of his stories - you don't get all the facts until the tale is finished and the criminal caught.  I got this to try out the Kindle PC Reader software, and it works fine,so I will probably put one of the portable devices on my Christmas list.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is the best PS3 controller out there. My original PS3 controller came without the Dualshock technology, so when it came time to purchase more controllers I bought 2 of these. The battery life is well over 4 hours of continuous use, and the games offer good support for rumbling when they should. If you are looking for a rumble controller, I recommend purchasing the authentic Sony PS3 controllers such as these, and avoid the fake controllers out there. It is worth the premium, plus 1 controller is less than 1 game these days, so don't skimp on a cheap controller.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great Trilogy set! I was very captured by this book and couldn't set it down. I would recommend these books to anyone to purchase!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Game is really addictive.  Pace starts out a bit slow, but picks up in later rounds. Make sure to upgrade weapons often.
145162445X|3.0|Okay, here's the thing: it's a good, well written book but the title is somewhat misleading. In fact, the title borders on being a pun. Basically, the author is saying that \\"nothing\\" does not exist - that is NOT a double negative. With all the coverage of expanding universe(s), inflationary periods, dark matter, dark energy, the pros and cons of string theory, etc, it seems the basic point is that an intelligent creator is at best redundant and most likely nonexistent. The afterword, by Richard Dawkins, echoes (rather gleefully) this point. I feel that both fail to establish that point. While I agree that we will probably never be able to prove a creator, I don't think they can prove the negative. If they are so willing to credit string theory as possible despite the fact that it calls for seven or eight dimensions that we cannot see or experience in any way, why not at least allow for an intelligent creator who established the rules of physics at or before the big bang. I am not speaking here of a particular religion's view of this creator but just of some author of the universe, and it's rules, the big bang, evolution, etc.. I think we owe that consideration at least to the second law of thermodynamics in regard to its view on entropy.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|One night while accompanying America and her boyfriend Shepley, Abby go's to see Shelpley's cousin and roommate Travis, a local hero and underground fighting champion {aka...the elusive sexy man-whore of Eastern U} fight live in the ring. Standing out in her little pink cardigan sweater, Travis is taken by the pretty, fresh faced girl who looks nothing like the average bimbos who crawl all over him 24/7 and is immediately drawn to her sparkle. Travis is determined to know her and Abby at first does not fall for his sexy charms and good looks or even the cute name he calls her {Pigeon} no matter the try, he cant change her mind. While a tad awkward due to the physical chemistry between them, Abby and Travis strike up a very snarky and playful friendship that begins having a dramatic effect on Travis, and Travis being Travis, the proud cant share my feelings type, never tells Abby how he truly feels and winds up acting out in some not so gentlemanly ways.<br /><br />I cant say enough how much I liked this book, while going into it I was expecting to read about this awful horrid psycho named Travis, but what I realized by the end was that I really liked McGuire's style of writing and grew to care about bad-boy Travis. Was Travis a prince charming? Absolutely not...Travis was an emotional wreck and a product of his childhood, the boy lost his mother, was abused and had a ton of self esteem issues. He protected himself by placing a wall around his heart, most of Travis's behavior {the fighting, sleeping around} were defense mechanisms, he used people before they could use him, pretty much a classic case of an abandoned or neglected child. This complaint about Travis being a domestic abuser...I just don't see it. What I saw was a macho tough guy who's creator indulged him in a fantasy world of being too hot, too tattooed and able to make girls go squee in their pants........<br /><br />Abby takes Travis by surprise, the real emotional connection brought true intimacy that in itself was too overwhelming for him. It scared him, unsettled him, made him a codependent nightmare that sometimes turned to jealousy, fits of violence against guys who would dare take a crack at Abby's boobs and trashing his apartment. This doesn't scream danger to me, it screams grow up. Fortunately that's exactly what all these issues amount to, stepping stones in Travis's maturity and the big boy pants he would eventually put on. Granted his character was prone to douche-baggery but thank goodness the Travis in the end was not the Travis we met in the beginning.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is fiction, so enjoy it for what it is, a guilty pleasure liable to make you blush. Despite a few minor typos, its sure to be an Indie stand out among readers. Defiantly gritty, defiantly unconventional but nonetheless, still a love story.in itself was too overwhelming for him.

B0077PBPJ6|5.0|Almost always, the Masterpiece folks produce a product which puts most Hollywood efforts to shame; \\"Birdsong\\" is such an example.  Expertly acted--Eddie Redmayne will soon become an internationally recognized actor of exceptional talent--beautifully filmed--the cinematography is nearly perfect--skillfully edited, \\"Birdsong\\" leaves the viewer with the feeling of having been part of something special.  It is not a movie to be watched while chatting with others, washing dishes, reading the paper, etc.; rather, it is a carefully constructed work which deserves attention to the development of the characters--pay attention to the \\"silences\\" while the camera focuses on the actors; their faces, eyes, movemets, are telling us something about themselves. There's plenty of action, graphic war scenes, and a bit of sex--all of which are included to enhace the development of the characters and to move the plot to its conclusion.  If you're a fan of car chase/crash movies, this is not for you. If you want to see a moving experience which clearly demonstrates a team effort(actors, director, music, camera work, editing, sound, writers, etc.)to produce a quality final product, then I recommend you take the time and watch this movie.

B005C5A6C0|5.0|First off I'll admit that I like supercharger for two reasons 1) It was my introdution to Machine Head 2) I actually like \\"Nu-Metal\\". Now just cause that was my intro into Machine Head should not lead you to imply that I don't have the grounds to make these boast, But let further inform you that a few months after that purchase I caught them live and was absolutely blown away and proceded to snag there 1st three albums. Having immersed myself in Machine Head I quickly realized why long time fans where so put off but unlike metallica these boys took heed to the demands of there fans, Ashes was the quick turn around the Blackening was a return to form and this Unto The Locust is a statement. This album is flawless in my own opinion granted this tends to lean more towrads striaght up metal than it does to thrash, Reguardless this album starts off very ominous with a chioresque chat that builds into nice chug and proceeds to kick into high gear, Unbeknown to me this is not what is in store for the listener because then the riff kicks in and dude you are off. Locust is an unrelenting slab off killer riffs excellent guitar play and sharp precise solos, The drumming is full on clean aggresive fury and as always the bass is spot on and vocally this is rob at quite possibly his brightest moment not to mention for me these are some of his most mature and well penned lyrics to date with Darkness Within being the best track on this album. I can honestly say that yes this is a masterpiece, So to any and all fans of metal you would be doing yourself a grave injustice by not getting this album.

1609611543|5.0|Bravo Dr. Davis, this is the best book of this type that I have ever read.  It begins with a brief history of wheat.  This is most helpful as the author builds his case.  What is most remarkable to me is that by following the Doctor's advice, I realized the results he describes.  I have much more energy.  My blood pressure and cholesterol levels have dropped, and no more acidy stomach.  This book is well researched and written, and a quick read.
B007SPPANM|4.0|Up until 48 hours ago I must have been the only person on the planet not to have seen this film! Curious how you can sometimes miss cultural juggernauts. It's even curiouser given I'm a fan of Leo's work. I'm sure I probably haven't got much to add that hasn't already been said but I thought I'd write a review anyway because the film has stayed etched on my mind since I saw it.<br /><br />As it turns out, this is a multi-Oscar winner that pulls off the unique trick of being brilliant and rightly deserving its classic status with a movie that in places is toe-curlingly bad. For this writer/producer/director James Cameron must surely take the blame.<br /><br />Cameron is a genius with the visuals and action. Everything looks utterly authentic; the camerawork, especially as the boat goes down, is masterful; the structure and how he allows us to see every aspect of life on the ship, brilliant. But Cameron knows that all this will count for nothing unless there's a human story at the heart of it. For that he deserves credit but alas his writing skills aren't up to the challenge. So the relationship between Jack and Rose, although touching in places, is also heavy-handed and a bit mawkish. Cameron is a well-known control freak on set which is a shame because if he'd handed some of the writing duties to a more sensitive scribe then quite possibly TITANIC would have been the greatest film ever made. Instead it's nearly there. Oh, and James Horner's score doesn't help: it can be gut-churningly sentimental.<br /><br />Having said all that, as the ship sinks, especially in the final moments as it stands at a right angle from the ocean Cameron has captured some of the most visceral and haunting images ever put down on film. I found it almost too distressing to watch.
0545123275|4.0|I liked it. It kind of left off where you're thinking \\"Okay, so now where is this going to go?\\" But I liked the writing style, the way the characters just connected, and how the characters got along. I didn't like the so called 'best friends' of Grace in the beginning, but Sam acted as if he were Jacob and Grace was like Bella(Twilight Saga reference.) I really thought it was a different kind of Twilight, but without the vampires. Grace's new little 'boyfriend,' I guess we would call him, is more grown up than someone for his age, in my eyes.<br /><br />Now for the summery(spoiler free, we find this stuff out in the first fifty pages):<br />  Grace is a girl who was dragged off of her tire swing as a young girl by a pack of wolves. As she was dying, she was saved by another wolf. Her wolf. After she was saved, she goes to a book store where her wolf works. Yes, it works. As a human named Sam. She never knew that when he saved her, he would come back from the woods, just to see her. One day, after a vicious murder, the wolves were accused of killing the young guy. Eventually, hunters decide to hunt the wolves for the town's safety. Is Grace going to see her wolf die? What will she do to warn him? Will she get there in time? How can she stop the hunt? Will she ever see him as a human? Will she get to know him? Or will she just...shiver?<br /><br />Yes, I just made the summery up from my own words.<br /><br />My grading scale:<br /><br />Originality: 9/10. I kind of thought a little of New Moon through this book.<br />Writing style: 15/15<br />Characters: 20/40 I didn't like the peers from school.<br />Plot: 20/25<br />Ending: 10/10<br />Score 74/100<br /><br />Grade: C.<br />Sex/kissing: No sex, just some mild kissing.<br />Drug/alcohol reference: None, that I remember<br />Age group: 13-14<br /><br />ALSO POSTED ON GOODREADS AND MY BLOG!!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Just saw ep II on my 60\\" plasma & new theater speakers, M70s & was totally blown away by the blu ray version. 1000% more detail visually than the original release imho. I never saw these films in a theater, only at home on sdvd & using an old tv & htib at that, so to upgrade to a great home theater was awe inspiring in its visual presentation & sound. The epic battles & explosions could be felt in the seat of my pants. Saw things in more glorious color & detail than I ever did before, so I'm totally impressed with the blu ray release at least for ep I-III; saw ep IV on blu ray & altho it is a bit more clear/detailed, was nothing much of an improvement either sight or sound imho, so I'll give the whole double trilogy 4 stars mainly because the later episodes are so much better in transferance to blu ray than the early ones & they only rate 2 stars. Personally, I kinda wish they'd redo IV-VI just for grins because technology is so much better than it was in '76 etc.
0345803485|1.0|That's about all I can say about this book.  It's just plain silly.<br /><br />I get this impression that the premise behind this particular opus was a coldly clinical attempt (probably, by a cabal of publishers) to turn a piece of \\"erotic\\" fiction/romance into a mainstream success.  I can imagine a meeting of a bunch of suits discussing the various possibilities to finally settle on the (apparently) winnning recipe.  Start with one piece of erotic/romance fiction.  Make sure all the ingredients are as cliche as possible.  Specifically, mix one innocent beautiful young debutante with one rakishly handsome, wealthy and yet youthful bandit/pirate/corporate raider, who is all twisted up and tortured inside.  Sprinkle liberally with orgasms for all and sundry.  Finally, for the secret ingredient, add a touch of BDSM, et voila!  Your piece de resistance is complete and rejoicing is sure to be had all around!<br /><br />In summary, this book made me laugh, for all the wrong reasons.
0345803507|5.0|I ordered the 1st book after seeing this author on the Today show. I'm not a book reader- I find reading very boring but after her interview I looked online to find the 1st one. I was about 100 pages into it when I realized that I had to order the next 2 in this series. They were so easy to read & I was actually pleasantly surprised that # 2 & # 3 were even better than the 1st one. I could not put these books down & now that I have read them- I wish this author had written more. As an unknown author- she really knows how to write a book!!! I will be looking forward to anything else she writes as she turned this bored wife & mother into a book reader!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERIES!! But left me wanting more!!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Many times I know the perfect word to use in a conversation, but I don't know the correct pronunciation.  This dictionary provides the meaning of words plus the verbal pronunciations.  Just what I need!
0345803485|1.0|Boring, disappointing and waste of time and money. The prose is bad and extremely repetitive and the characters are completely ridiculous. The description of the characters is the same everywhere in the book and the story is just not worth commenting about. Romance is not particularly my interest, but, after the reviews on this book, I decided to give it a try and I have to say, I would not recommend it to anyone.

0545425115|5.0|I got this book because I had heard good things about it. I read it and it is an excellent read. I liked it because it isn't filled with explicit sex, it was really nice for a change to be able to read all the words. I am waiting to see what my Grandson thinks of it, he's seen the movie and decited he wanted to read the book. He's 15, I'm 70 - so it seems to appeal to a wide age range.
0345803485|3.0|Honestly, if we're comparing this to most erotica, it was better than most. If we're comparing it to the Twilight series, it was better than that as well. And, I suppose, for a young adult audience it was not flagrantly bad.<br />I have to say, though, that some of the narrative could use a healthy injection of...shall I say...diversity? The author could do a tiny bit better with a more expensive thesaurus, I guess..<br />Seriously, I was more distracted by the overuse of such phrases as \\"oh crap\\" and \\"holy cow\\" than I was with any of the characters' kinky sex scenes.<br />All in all, not bad for a fanfic writer. I'll read the rest of the trilogy

B007JRUA7K|4.0|Michelle Williams is astonishingly good in this charming look at a week in the life of Marlilyn Monroe. Michelle delivers one of the years best performances, backed by a solid cast. Highly entertaining!
0345803485|1.0|I. I don't even. Where to start. How...<br /><br />The really short of this is, I WISH this was a better book than it is. I WISH that Anastasia was a stronger, more compelling character than she is. I WISH Christian was a more gentle, considerate and careful Dom than he ends up being. ... But it's not, she's not, he's not. It just a mess.<br /><br />I spent so much time being so frustrated with both characters-- I can't even demonize one, they're both a mess! They never really have a proper, straight forward conversation about what each of them wants, it just drove me bonkers. I would say, that it might get your blood pumping if you like reading sex, but please oh please don't read it for the plot because it's such a horrible imagining of male/female relationships.<br /><br />I was particularly frustrated with: a) how many times Anastasia outright says that Christian Grey is a stalker, a control freak, a danger to her-- yet she goes along with everything anyway. Why are Ana's observations not important? b) Why, oh why why why, does Ana assume that Christian doesn't/can't love her? (WHY E L James do you give Christian a \\"broken childhood\\" past to explain the BDSM? Argh!) Why does Ana assume that she has to SUFFER and ENDURE all of the \\"horrible\\" things Christian wants to do to her in order to have a relationship with him? So much of this is not explained, they don't talk about it, it's assumptions that Ana makes and because the book is written entirely in her 1st person perspective, we just have to assume that her assumptions are correct. ... They probably aren't. And it's horrible, and frustrating.
0545265355|5.0|Awesome book very hard to put down, this is one o the first books that ive really enjoyed. I usually only read that which ive been required to but after CLS school this is great take ur mind off school/work:
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was intriguing. There were definitely things to think about. I enjoyed getting new characters, but several fell flat for me. I enjoyed it initially after reading but then found myself less interested as days passed. It just wasn't as emotional for me as the first. It felt like it repeated a lot of the first. I ended this one not really caring if I went on to the third.  With that being said, I thought it was worth reading. The series is interesting. This is such a unique premise. I know a lot of people read it for the love story, but that part actually doesn't fit well for me. I enjoy the larger picture and that this book actually gives major themes to think about. There were a few moments where I couldn't stop, but this book was easier to put down than the first. This series is definitely one of the most interesting I have gotten into in a while.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Minor glitches issue had some of my timers on the various items get stuck on over 554 hours when it should be like 5 min. no way to gain any $ unless you purchase when you should receive a credit for daily play...other than that its been fun building a town.

B002N5KVDG|5.0|Alot of people don't realize that Jello didn't just write most of the words for the Dead Kennedys, he also wrote most of the music. It really shows on this album. With members of Victims Family, Faith No More, and Rollins Band there's plenty of talent here. With a million hardcore clones and Hot Topic crap rock around, not to mention all the faux 80s revival bands (fake Dead Kennedys, fake Misfits, and even a fake Reagan Youth!) its refreshing to here something something this good! Think Dead Kennedys with more of a space rock vibe. If you like Dead Kennedys or any of Jello's post-DKs projects (Tumour Circus, Lard, Jello with the Melvins, DOA, Nomeansno, ect) you'll dig the f- outta this. Its as if the Dead Kennedys actually did come back!<br /><br />The lyrics? Political satire as usual. Bashing on how little difference there is between Obomber and Dubya. Ofcourse done with the usual humour and satire. The album ends with optimistic song. Kinda unusual. Basically sounds like DKs. For better or worse. I'm into it. If you don't like Jello's voice or politics or you like your music generic then you'll hate it. If you're not lame like that then buy off alternativetentacles.com cause its the same price there.

B007FC3AAI|1.0|I do not remember the last time I saw a movie so terrible, yet sat through it. I guess I am a glutton for punishment.<br /><br />The first Twilight movie was entertaining enough. I read the books after that. Bad writing but an entertaining story. Second and third movies got progressively worse, so why I watched this, I don't know.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson are not shy about how silly they think the books and movies are, and it comes through in their robotic acting. There is so little emotion in these movies it's not even funny. But I guess not much emotion is described in the books, so what can the screenwriters do to create the emotions that never existed?<br /><br />The musical score was atrocious except for the reincarnations of the themes from the first movie, which Carter Burwell composed. I liked his work in the first movie. In this movie, though, I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's understandable that with a teen love story, you want to spend time on the wedding and honeymoon. But save for the sex scene and the wedding toasts, neither part was remotely exciting. The wedding ceremony was visually pleasing, but again devoid of real emotion. It's like someone drew a picture of what they wanted their wedding to look like and the producers went on that and threw some random people in.<br /><br />I just don't understand how a movie can be SO BAD.

Still a great movie. I got this set for $25 from Amazon. I thought it was a great price considering it came with all that was described in the photo. It actually looks much nicer and bigger in person. The box looked very elegant like I paid at least $50 for it so I had my whole family fooled like I was the biggest Julie Andrews fan hehe

B001FB55I0|3.0|Well, as far as cinematography having come a long way...in comparison to previous Terminator movies, I found this one the least interesting. Without having to give out spoilers, it just felt like a filler story to try and satisfy the fanatics, but it did not personally satisfy me. Perhaps it's mostly because I needed the \\"Gov'nah\\" lol. And I thought the last Terminator was \\"meh\\" (don't get me wrong, the hubby loved the hot robot chick, haha), this one was double \\"meh\\" for me.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I had to send back the first Blu Ray because when I opened it up, it contained 2 random CD-R's that were OBVIOUSLY not the the movie, lol. However, Amazon was very quick in sending out a replacement. That was a first experience with Amazon I had to deal with.

B004ZY0VHY|4.0|What a chilling story!  Though I guess there was some sort of redemption at the end, when Eva, though not so certain, heard Kevin mumble \\"I'm sorry\\".<br /><br />I love the way the story was told.  The \\"chapters\\" were in the form of letters written by Eva to her husband, nearly 2 years after that unforgettable \\"Thursday\\".  The letters were going forward and backward through time reliving the before and after.  Of course, it saved the climax and big revelation for last, but with great timing.  One would have probably guessed what actually happened, but not until the time when Eva got home and saw the unkempt kitchen.<br /><br />A note to Mr. Shriver - I sure had a lot of use for the Kindle dictionary while reading your book.  It has a lot of big words, a teacher will not run out of words for a vocabulary mastery test .  For that, I am deducting one star.

I actually went out and bought the other two in the trilogy and spent a whole weekend reading them back to back because I could not put them down! If you haven't read The Hunger Games you should! Suzanne Collins knows how to write well and keep the suspense up! I've heard this book being compared to the Twilight Saga and I can tell you it is WAY different in writing and in plot. If you have time and got nothing better to do buy all three of the books from the trilogy and have a weekend reading marathon. 5/5

B006ZZC3D6|4.0|This game is addicting.  It starts out easy but eventually gets hard as you have to use strategy to figure out how to clear the screen.  It is very basic but fun and challenging.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|when I first got my kindle fire I was asking everyone what games should I get on it. Everybody suggested &quot;draw something &quot;...only one problem...if wasn't available.  I just found out from being on amazon.com. So happy well off to play now!
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I purchased this album at the recomendation of a friend.  I enjoy most of the songs on the album they have good beats and the album is nice to listen to as a whole.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|Well Sherlock Holmes need no introduction, for those who are interested in these kind of books, Sherlock Holmes is one of the legends. Kindle has done a good work with the book its really appreciable. Well written, good stories and the free part makes it best. Thumbs up for this one ;)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Review is for the Kindle Fire app:<br /><br />Love this app! I've been using YouVersion online and on an iPod touch for years.  I use it almost every day.  However, YouVersion needs to secure the rights so the NIV can be dowloaded for offline use.  The Kindle Fire doesn't have 3G connection, and I don't have wifi at home.  Really want the NIV for offline use.  If I had that I'd give it 5 stars.
B004UHSB5A|4.0|I've found this game an enjoyable way to pass the time, and hardly a day goes by that I don't play at least one game.<br /><br />Some reviewers have negatively commented on both the size of the game pieces and the difficulty of placing them, but I have no complaint in either area. If the pieces were bigger, the board would be cluttered, and once you understand that you can release the new piece when the appropriate end piece shows a green halo,  you have it made!<br /><br />I'd like to have a running won/lost counter. That would make this a five star app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for staying near to God; without the weight of a heavy regular Bible. Many different versions available and cool features like read aloud and bookmarks.
0345803485|1.0|I HATED this book and am sorry I wasted my time reading it. Trust me, I'm no prude but found it very demeaning to women.  I wish someone could explain to me why it's so popular.
0345803485|1.0|This is one of worst books I have ever read and cannot believe the five star rating for this. The words are very repetitive and distracting. I cringe every time the protagonist uses inner goddess. This book has nothing more than sex and two bipolar people.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was never boring. It always had me wondering what was going to happen next. I had a hard time putting the book down to get other things done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|LIKE THE FIRST BOOK WHEN YOU START READING IT- IT IS HARD TO PUT DOWN. THE BOOK MAKES YOU LAUGH, SAD AND CRY. I WAS UNHAPPY WHEN I READ THE LAST PAGE.  I WANTED MORE.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book really brought it all together. She fought the demons of her past and won and they truly deserved what they got. All that rage and anger that she held onto all those years are really what saved her and gave her the strength and will to live and avenge her mother's death and her abuse as well. She learned to let her guard down and trust again which was a huge obstacle/task for her but she did it. She found out that there are people that are willing to go to any lengths to help you out and want nothing in turn but friendship and your well being. She got her life back or should I say started a new life/beginning one that will have peace and calmness.
0545425115|5.0|This book is most definitely one of my favorites. Shipped really fast. Started reading it right away and couldn't put it down. Definitely recommend!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a rhrilling game that will keep you on the edge of your seat for countless hours on end.
078322737X|3.0|I enjoyed this movie when it came out many years ago. I purchased the DVD to share with my daughter and her friends. The music is still fun and Wolfman Jack is wild, but the overall movie was slow. I was actually bored watching it.  The best part was picking out young celebrities that are now as old as I am!  I won't tell you it's a bad movie...its a movie for a rainy day when there is nothing else to do.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game :) I think all the characters are adorable. And ice age is one of my fav movies, so this is a perfect game for me.
0345803493|5.0|Ok, so  you have to take a break between each book so you can breathe and digest and enjoy and rationalize all that you have read and learned.  These books change you: who you want to be, how you want to have sex, how you view others.  (watch out!) You won't be disappointed with this one.  Different, includes all you love about #1, new intimate story lines, new danger, new questions.  So, get it already!  See you at #3!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a good variety, very addictive, fun mini games. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 101- in 1 games is a good app to have good for all ages.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have played this game for three days straight.My sister loves it to she got it on her kindle. :):)
0898159156|5.0|This is one of the best books I have have ever purchased!  Not only is it informative as to it is so beautiful and the pictures are out of this world!!!!!!  I highly recommend if you like these plants that you should purchase this book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A wonderful 3rd edition of a great fantasy series.  The saga of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros continues.  Sam Tarley and Jon Snow continue to work beyond the wall with the Wildlings.  Jamie has been set free by Catelyn Stark to be given back to the Lannisters in exchange for Sansa and Arya.  Brienne of Tarth, the woman knight pledged to Catelyn is taken him back in chains in order to rescue the girls.  Jeoffrey, the teen king is now to wed Margery Tyrell, the former wife of Renly Baratheon in a large ceremony.  Stannis and Davos lost a great battle and must figure out how to win and reconcile their beliefs of  the Red Woman who controls who live and who dies.<br />Of course things don't ever go as planned in Westeros and Storm of Swords is no different.  Arya can't seem to get home even after escaping the House of Lannister but continues wandering after several setbacks.  Sansa is the eternal maid looking for her handsome prince and judging people by their looks more than their deeds.  Danerys continues to learn more about the man Jonah was and raise her dragons.  A running theme I find in the story is about how people are judged by their looks and dismissed for infirmities and lack of physical attractiveness.  This book is a champion of the outsiders and different.  Arya is a girl who enjoys things a boy is usually thought to enjoy.  Jamie the handsome Lannister loses something that made him a fighter and becomes better for it.  Brienne, thought of as ugly has beauty inside.  Tyrion, the ultimate hero, suffers terribly under a family who hates him for being a dwarf and a society who believes him ugly.  Cersi, beauty intact, contains an ugliness inside no one can match.  Jeoffrey, beautiful boy, is a monster.  The surprises are many in this book and I loved the character development, unusual in most popular fiction, but this isn't an ordinary series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series moves quickly, is an easy read and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.  I read it because my jr high students were excited about it.  The story really appeals to the jr hi level reader for excitement and action.  It is good to find an author who does not use sex and detailed depictions of violence to make a story line exciting and captivating.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is soo much fun. at first when my friends told me about it I was kinda skepticle about it. but when I got it I had a lot of fun playing. it is one of those games that you just want to keep coming back to. it also helps pass the time if you are bored. I do not get why some people put bad reviews because this game is SO FLIPING AWESOME. do youshould deffinatly get this app.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|It does the job you need it to but really for the price expected way more.  This item should be priced half what it is.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Kahneman shares deep insights from his long years of research and analyses into human behavior and thought. I found myself reading slowly at first, as I digested each subchapter on heuristics and concepts that were new to me, but was soon sucked into the implications of his research.<br /><br />A common mistake from reading this book would be to think that \\"people are usually rational but can fall into these traps\\". On the contrary, what I took away was that the idea of \\"rational thought\\" or \\"rational decision-making\\" by individuals (or market agents), the necessary basis of economic theory, is not true. This is not to say that people are irrational all the time. Rather, we are easily guided or swayed in many directions in thought and perception of the world around us.<br /><br />This idea, which seems bald and obviously true when written out, was a thought that made me think twice, and a grain of salt for me to keep in mind in all situations.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this game is so awesome with the grafics but the only bad thing was that u couldn't pick your own player it is awesomenessssssssssssss
0399159029|3.0|The \\"old\\" Bernie is back in this book. The last two or three books took him out of Germany ( and the \\"war\\" period) and that did not lend it self to the atmosphere that set the first three ( and maybe 5) books into 5 star range.<br />This last book was goodbut way too long and it needed to be edited down. The plot was ok and the characters intesting enough in their own rights. Worth the read, esp if you have read the first three.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is a compelling, thought  provoking read. I highly recommend this book. It is a Great for a book club...worthy of discussion.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|My wife and I drove down to St. Louis to see them live at Blueberry Hill. They performed brilliantly live! Not only is this a great 'neo-folk' album as I like to call it, but the entire group really is made up of great musicians. This album is definitely worth the purchase for those fans of Mumford and Sons and Fleet Foxes.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This WAS a five-star app.  But now it is nothing more than trojan-horse spyware.<br /><br />Do you want to pay $15 for spyware?  Neither do I.  I've been using the previous version which did not spy on all its customers.<br /><br />This software wants to know what you've been running on your device, both currently and before launching.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|This is a beautifully made, well acted series.  Thank goodness I already knew the story as told by many wonderful biographers and whereas I can overlook the MANY historical inaccuracies, I found myself constantly saying things like, \\"that's not true\\", or \\"that never happened\\", or \\"that would not happen in a million years\\".  However, I forgave all because of the acting and production value, the scenerary and costumes (once again historically inaccurate)were beautiful and the people were beautiful.  In truth the only one of his wives that was within a 100 mile radius of the way the historical paintings show them is probably Anne Boylene, the others were not close.  Catherine of Aragon was under 5 ft tall, with auburn hair and a pale complection, Jane Seymour, #3 wife was considered plain even by 16th century standards, the portrait of Anne of Cleves, 4th wife, looks to our modern eye to be  attractive, however, we all know what Henry thought of her.  Katherine Howard, # 5 was considered a great beauty in her day, her portraits do not show this, at least not to the modern eye, his 6th and final wife, Katherine Parr was in my humble opinion the most attractive and she was also considered very \\"handsome\\" in her time.  Of cource in a series such as this the women must all be beautiful and the men handsome. I won't go into detail about the men, just to say \\"hunks\\" were not prevalent in the 16th century.<br /><br />But, even with all of this, it was a throughly entertaining series.
B002R5HR70|4.0|My wife is satisfied so a bit costly but she thinks it was worth it. I on the other hand feel that to not have the DVD in our possession is like renting a car from Hertz, only difference we can pick the car up and drive it at anytime but we cannot keep it in our garage.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the \\"Game of Thrones,\\" and thus had some trepidation about a video adaptation.  This series, however, is thoroughly enjoyable.  I'm finding that when reading the later books, I'm visualizing the characters as shown in this series.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|I use it to carry my earplugs, cell phone, Ipod, & internet connection product.  It makes it easy to take everything with me when I go out of town.

Little hole on top for the strap... cool.  Not sure how safe the velcro beltstrap is, but camera does not weight much so, I see no problems there.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was exciting and kept me motivated to keep reading it.  It was well worth the price to read on my Kindle.
B007C4AZCA|4.0|Ten year old Sirka's world is a happy one. She has loving parents and a fun-loving four year old brother whom she adores. But all that changes on the night of July 16, 1942 when German-occupied Paris is forced to give up it's Jewish families. Up to this point the Germans have only taken away the men of the family. However on this particular night they grab entire families. Sirka, not knowing what all of this means, thinks to save her little brother Michel by locking him into a secret cupboard with his favorite toy and a flashlight. It is her intention to come back for him after she and her family are released. She drops the key to the cupboard into her skirt pocket.<br /><br />The next few weeks are a blur of confusion as Sirka and her family are taken to the Velodrome d'Hiver, a large sort of coliseum, where everyone is packed in without food, water, or any of life's basic needs. Within days many die and others become sick. At last the women and men are separated. The men are bussed to a camp from which they are taken by cattle car to Auschwitz where they are ultimately put to death. Sirka and her mother (who by now has retreated into her mind) are taken to a different camp where the children are separated from their mothers. The mothers, like the men before them, are soon herded into cattle cars and shipped to Auschwitz as well. The children will soon follow. But Sirka and another girl manage to escape the camp with the help of a French guard. Throughout this time Sirka has only one driving thought, to return to the family's home in Paris and release her brother who, she fears, has learned to hate her for not coming back sooner.<br /><br />Fast forward sixty years to the anniversary of this awful event and meet Julia Jarmond, an American married to a Frenchman. She is a journalist who knew little to nothing about the Children of the Vel d'Hiv. Through her research she learns the story of Sirka (Susan). The story of this child soon consumes her and she is driven to learn all that she can. The facts, well-hidden from the world, lead her on a quest from France, to the United States, to Italy, and finally back to France. Julia learns that there are secrets her husband's family know but refuse to reveal; secrets that entwine their lives, and ultimately Julia's, with the life of Sirka (Susan).<br /><br />This is a powerful story, one that taught me more than I've ever known about the cruelties of World War II. The young girl Sirka, whose story we follow, proves to be one of the strongest characters I have encountered in fiction. Although Julia, the American journalist, proves to be the catalyst for the story, I would have preferred to hear the story through Sirka's own voice (as in early chapters of the book). The personal mid-life crisis that Julia goes through adds little to the story. To be fair, though, Julia is a strong character in her own right.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I enjoy the fact that living here in Florida you can check the radar to see how close storms are and in what direction they are coming.Great for traveling to different locations for updates.Find it very useful on my Kindle Fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun game.  Cute characters that my kids love!!  This is a good game if you want to kill some time.  You do not have to turn off your fire to close out of the game.  Click on &quot;stuff&quot; then &quot;options&quot; and you will be able to get back to your home screen.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A must read for everybody who wants to know the sacrifice these men put on the line for their country and their brothers.A book you can read many times over,
B004X80QNG|1.0|Terrible in the Kindle Fire. Doesn't sync at all. Not using it anymore. The Kindle Fire has been out for a long time and this app doesn't work at all still. Incredible! Find a solution!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read the trilogy in a week, could not put these books down. What an amazing read, not to mention what it does for your libido!!! Great story and characters. Another review said it was poorly written?? Not sure what planet they are on but this book is HOT sex revolution for women ;)
B000002B5L|3.0|Amazon did its thing as usual by having the product delivered to my house by the estimated day, actually I got the cd earlier. Cd came in perfect condition but the songs were not that great. I say there are five songs that are actually great. Its just one of those cds that you would get bored of quick but I do not regret buying it.
1612130283|1.0|I was recommended this book by a friend of mine, but once I started it, I just couldn't understand what the big deal was about.  This is a poorly written book with repetition of words and phrases.  I found it very difficult to make it through, but I did, and have absolutely no desire to purchase book 2 and 3.  Also, I was able to see the free sample of the book on my Kindle, so that should have been my first inkling that the book wasn't for me.  I suggest you do the same if you're considering this book and have a Kindle.  Also, I hope readers who do like this book don't view the relationship as something everyone experiences...to me, it was very abusive.  My expectations for this book were just too high due to all the hype and the fact that it's a best seller...atrocious book.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|These songs are built to last. That´s the first impression you get when listening to the more than 70 songs on this collection. It is sheer mind boggling to see how one person can come up with such a wealth of musical and poetic masterpieces. Songs you might have never even noticed, songs like \\"Heart of Mine\\" or \\"No time to think\\", turn out to be diamonds that were just waiting to be polished by young artists like Blake Mills or The Belle Brigade. Other interpretations, like Kravitz´ \\"Rainy Day Woman\\" or Mick Hucknall´s \\"One of us must know\\", who seems to be trying to out-Dylan Dylan even in his phrasing, pointlessly copy the always superior originals. And then there´s gems like Miley Cyrus´ surprisingly sensitive and lovely rendition of \\"You gonna make me lonesome when you go\\", Carly Simon´s brilliant jazzy cabaret interpretation of \\"Just like a woman\\", and the heartbreaking version of \\"Boots of Spanish Leather\\", Dylan´s early ballad of loss, by LA´s Airborne Toxic Event. A mixed bunch, all in all, but a fascinating journey through Dylan´s all-encompassing world and oeuvre.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you have never really enjoyed erotica then you shouldn't even have tried to read this. It's like watching romantic comedy even when you don't like it. You're really never going to enjoy it. SO with that said, I have to say, that, being someone who really loves this type of writing, that it's an amazing story. From Fifty Shades of grey to the end end of Fifty Freed. Which gives you a clue about how this will end. I loved Anastasia but I really loved Christian. They needed each other. It wasn't as much about Ana having so much sex, but about who she is and how she needed to trust herself to set her limits. And as for Christian, he hid himself for so long behind a personality that he made more monstrous as his years went by. He found Ana and could find a way to learn to understand himself through his complete love for her. My stomach was in knots for some of this, and I have to say that I'm glad I found out about these three books after they all were published. I couldn't have handled it otherwise. At the end of book three, Ms James writes the beginning again but told through Christian's eyes. I would love to read this adaptation. Not on three books though. We all know what happens through the first series, so a lot could be left out. It would definitely need to be an add-on book to be read only after the others. But I would love to know his thoughts and feelings, insecurities and his total love for Ana that he never thought possible. Thank you for this beautiful story. I was crazy while reading it but I am so very glad I did.
B004OYUNTG|4.0|I just got this watch about 3 days and like it very much.<br /><br />I like...<br /><br />The watch looks great with the black face and the style of it make it look like a thousand dollar watch rather than 100 bucks.<br />It has all the usual casio digital functionalities (World time, stop watch, Timer, count down and alarm)<br />It has a light (but not bright)<br />Metal bracelet/ bucket to provide the classy look<br />A more modern look with the 45mm wide face<br />It shows the day of the week, month and date on the digital background<br />Bracelet is long enough for a GIANT's wrist<br />What I do NOT like...<br /><br />The metal links/bracelet feels cheap as they are very light like tin and not Stainless steal<br />The Light of is too soft and not bright<br />The little second hand dial do not move on normal clock mode (I think only in split mode in Stopwatch)<br />As mentioned on other reviews: No protection for the face of the watch (bezel is not raised even slightly or a Tachymeter )<br />It only has a listed 2 year battery life<br /><br />Because of the modern classy slick style where I can wear this watch to almost any event or daily, this is well worth the money and the cons which comes with it. I am replacing my waveceptor with this new watch.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|JOHN CARTER [OF MARS] is an excellent planetary romance that creates a sense of wonder in the viewer!  The film is VERY entertaining and actually gets better and better with repeated viewings!  I saw this movie multiple times at the theater and never tired of watching it, which is because the plot and background story are top quality.  The direction and music are so well done that it created the same emotional reactions in me EVERY time I viewed it!  (And I viewed it 12 times at the theater!  Now that is GREAT filmmaking!)<br /><br />Seriously, you will want this JOHN CARTER Blu-Ray/DVD for you home library, and my recommendation is that you just buy it in the four-disc format now because it's a great 3D film, and you know you'll be getting 3D at home before too long!  (The movie in 3D IMAX and 3D digital was an awesome spectacle!<br /><br />BUY IT and support a sequel by joining the Take Me Back To Barsoom Facebook site!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I haven't read a trilogy this good for a long time. I fell in love with all the main characters, and was incredibly depressed when I realized there wasn't anything else to read. The only problem I had was with the ending of the third book... in fact, it was sort of the whole book. She really pushed her agenda, which is fine, but inconsistent with the other two books. The third book was really depressing. Still, that doesn't ruin my Hunger Games experience, and I don't think the trilogy deserves any less than five stars. Again, really, really good. Well worth the read.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Hands down the best app for weather. I can put in multiple cooties, or look at the world teperatures at a glance.  I only wish it had better audio alerts for weather watnimgs.<br /><br />Great app, its a must have!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|It's not offen that a long awaited film based on a book, will live up to the book.  As a long time fan of John Carter (over 50 years) I was a little bit worried about the reviews - until I noticed that most were upset about things that were in the book!! Went to see the movie - it was great! It was the book brought to live on the big screen... only thing wrong is that it should have been titled \\"A Princess of Mars\\" the name of the book.

B003O86FMW|2.0|Trilogy review: Initially an exciting escape that becomes incredibly tedious.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a neat sci-fi action thriller set within a landscape of a desolated population that lives in fear and constant punishment from its tyrannical government.  In a vague sort of way one can imagine the landscape of North America devolving into such a state. The action has enough cool twists such as a futuristic Mad Max-esque combat dome featured within an American Idol-esque style reality TV show. The fast pace and quirkiness keeps one glued to the pages and you literally want to finish the adventure in one day. One can understand why Hollywood made a movie out of it.<br /><br />Once the Hunger Games are digested you are left craving a sequel in the same way that you would want to jump back on the rollercoaster the minute you dismount.  Unfortunately Catching Fire offers nothing new of interest and stretches out the exact same story line with contrived twists. You'll find yourself bored within the first fifty pages.<br /><br />While Catching Fire is a boring extension of the same theme of Hunger Games, Mocking Jay is a total disaster. Collins degrades the main character into a feminist warrior with a drawn out uninteresting love interest struggle that will leave you confused, bored and wishing you had just not attempted reading beyond the first novel.
0345803485|5.0|So I found out about this book two weeks ago from all people my boss. While browsing through books online I had seen this cover and the other two covers for the trilogy come up but thought nothing of it. At work the ladies in the office take you out to lunch for your birthday and since my birthday was last month they took me out. My boss kept talking about this book and recommending it to everyone. Her description of it was \\"It is like porn\\" and talked about how everyone is reading it in all age groups. Even though I wasn't to sure I wanted to read a book my boss labeled \\"porn\\" I figured I would give it a try and I found I truly enjoyed this book. I find the writing style of EL James flowed nicely and really pulled you into the characters in the book and the sex scenes in this book all I can say is \\"OH MY!\\" even for people who are not into S&M this book will get you hot under the collar and the story line is GREAT. Erotica doesn't normally make it on the best sellers list so should tell you something about this book! The story starts with this book and then carries on into the next two books in the trilogy (Fifty Shades Darker: Book 2 and Fifty Shades Freed  Book 3. The main character is Anastasia (aka Ana) Steele who is getting ready to graduate college. She agrees to help a friend out who has setup an interview with a young entrepreneur named Christian Grey for their college Newspaper (the friend was really sick and unable to do the interview but didn't want to cancel since it was so hard to get the interview setup). When they meet it is instant chemistry between the two of them. Ana has never felt this way before about anyone and seems unsure how to handle these intense feelings she feels. After the interview she assumes she will never see Mr. Grey again but what she doesn't know is he felt the same attraction when he met her and can't get her off his mind. They embark on a passionate, erotic, obsessive romance that leaves you not wanting to put the book down. The erotic scenes will leave you thinking long after you have put the book down. I HIGHLY recommend this book, however I will say I wasn't as impressed with books two and three. Two I somewhat enjoyed but found it a bit dull and the third book I couldn't even finish. But everyone is talking about this book, it was even talked about on the Dr Oz. show last week about how it is improving sex lives for women, who knew!e erotic scenes will leave you thinking long after you have put the book down.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Trilogy review: Initially an exciting escape that becomes incredibly tedious.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a neat sci-fi action thriller set within a landscape of a desolated population that lives in fear and constant punishment from its tyrannical government.  In a vague sort of way one can imagine the landscape of North America devolving into such a state. The action has enough cool twists such as a futuristic Mad Max-esque combat dome featured within an American Idol-esque style reality TV show. The fast pace and quirkiness keeps one glued to the pages and you literally want to finish the adventure in one day. One can understand why Hollywood made a movie out of it.<br /><br />Once the Hunger Games are digested you are left craving a sequel in the same way that you would want to jump back on the rollercoaster the minute you dismount.  Unfortunately Catching Fire offers nothing new of interest and stretches out the exact same story line with contrived twists. You'll find yourself bored within the first fifty pages.<br /><br />While Catching Fire is a boring extension of the same theme of Hunger Games, Mocking Jay is a total disaster. Collins degrades the main character into a feminist warrior with a drawn out uninteresting love interest struggle that will leave you confused, bored and wishing you had just not attempted reading beyond the first novel.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|From the beginning, I was fascinated by Anastasia and Christian.  It was difficult to put the book down! I was so captivated that I purchased and read the other two books in the trilogy as well. Good job, Ms.James!!

B003EYVXXW|5.0|i was recommmended the video by a friend and then on the amazon site, so i purchased it. It was a very historically accurate account of rise of religion and the sheer insanity of different beliefs which has got us all to where we are in this 21st centuary madness now. it just shows how peoples belief system and how they all think they are right and have all the anxwers, differs from what was really trying to be shown by the likes of jesus and the other profits like buddah and mahomad etc.... love one another!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play it whenever I have the chance and when I do I play it for hours and hours. I guess you may say I'm way adictectd
B004XNPQUO|1.0|Maybe I just can't really figure it out, maybe it's just a stupid game. Try it and judge for yourself.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Love playing this game, however, sometimes it freezes up or jumps back and forth...very frustrating when trying to better your time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun helps me pass the time away when I cant sleep or just have some free time
B002N5N5LG|5.0|*SPOILER ALERT* In the UK Community is barely known. I KNOW!!!!!<br /><br />I was introduced to this show by a friend I was visiting. I politely went along with his insistence that we watch one of his DVDs, as good guests do, little realising that one paintball episode later, I'd be hooked!<br /><br />I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!! The characters are well written, three dimensional and all given the opportunity to 'shine' - even minor characters are the stuff of minor sitcome leads. The dialogue is bitingly witty, knowing and lightning quick and the plotlines are INSPIRED. I mean, who would think of turning a story about the inadequate supply of fried chicken into a goodfellas/means streets/the Godfather pastiche?<br /><br />All this and series one is wrapped up in a top notch DVD set that includes mini episodes, outtakes, alternative scenes, producer's cuts, highlight reels, featurettes and commentaries with the cast and crew. A lot of care has also gone into the DVD sleeve design, which looks like a yearbook with comments from the characters - many other shows could learn a thing or two...<br /><br />Needless to say, if you buy this DVD you will be delighted. I was so impressed I recently bought season two! Go on, you know it makes sense....
B007JCP8FE|5.0|As with every one of Shinedown's albums, this one is right on time and true to who they are! Superb!!!
B000AY3KN0|5.0|after i thinking and i choose this dvd edition than blu-ray. perhaps transfer black and white more likely. and this dvd edition more bonus collectible. i love this edition .
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great and reliably!  It is a little strange to be able to go card by card rather than three at once.  But it makes it easier!
B005DESVPO|5.0|Only 4 songs but well recorded and very good guitar blues from a new (to Me) singer. Cant wait for a full album rumored for the fall from Gary Clark Jr
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Really fun especially on the fire or other tablets.the angry birds games are really fun esppecially this one. tons of levels all really fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I have become addicted to it. I keep going back to it to check on my babies and coins.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|the game itself is really cool. but the thing is when you create an account it does not let you have a password. then if you exit and click again it asks for password which you don't have
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Shame on E.L. James for glamorizing abuse. This book was featured on Dr. Oz, and shame on him for promoting such trash.<br /><br />Any woman who has ever been through the pain of physical, emotional or sexual abuse will find this book infuriating. NOT TITILLATING.<br /><br />Christian Grey is rich, stunningly attractive (physically, at least) and mysterious. Anastasia is the young innocent who is drawn to his charms, despite his cruelty.  *YAWN* How often has this tired theme been used?<br /><br />Why do so many find it acceptable for this man to manipulate, belittle and even beat her?<br /><br />Apparently, being handsome and rich makes it ok to be a complete jerk - a completely boring jerk.  Would he seem as enticing if he drove a Taurus and shopped at Wal-Mart? He would be labeled a wife-beater and arrested for domestic violence.<br /><br />The writing is atrocious: bland and repetitive. How many times can one read \\"Oh, my!\\" or \\"whoa\\" or \\"holy cow\\" and still be even mildly interested? It's surprising - and sad - that anyone would find the brutalization of a young girl by a violent, depraved older man enjoyable, much less arousing.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey isn't worth the money. The text, the story, and the characters are crude and mediocre. Anyone can use \\"naughty\\" words in a sentence; it takes a special talent to use these words and produce a decidedly UN-sexy story.<br /><br />*STUPID AND BORING AT BEST, A WASTE OF TEN BUCKS AT WORST*
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun games. Great for a free app. Seems to be quite a bit more fun than a lot of the pay apps.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|There is no denying that \\"In Time\\" is a great a portrayal of a dystopian society. As viewers we are brought into this world where time is the equivalent to currency. So, everything that would cost money in today's society (house payment, a cup of coffee, et cetera) costs time off of a person's life in the society portrayed in \\"In Time\\".  Once you run out of time, you die. This concept mirrors that of a caste system often depicted in dystopian societies, because the bourgeoisie has an endless amount of time whereas the proletariats struggle by the minute to gain time to their life. The standard of living is much higher and materialistic for the small upper-class population than that of the large lower-class population.<br /><br />  The premise of this society is to avoid aging. Everyone lives free of the worry of time until they are twenty-five years old, then they have one year to live unless they accumulate or spend more time. This is a good, yet exaggerated representation of what our society today can become. Most people worry constantly about aging, not only for looks but for their health too. \\"In Time\\" brings to life the issue of the drastic measures we are willing to take in order to live forever in the prime of our life. Also, this movie focuses on the reality of how we spend each second of our lives. It brings about the importance of how valuable our time is.  Although there isn't a detailed back story of how the society came to be this way in the movie, it is assumed that the majority of the population felt that their looks and health are more important than living life the way humans are meant to. Because of this drastic change in how humanity works, the upper-class citizens rule the society. They control the corporations, money, and the cost of living. This is another typical concept found in a dystopian society. A dystopia more often than not has a strong emphasis on the control of those in power.<br /><br />  Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, a poor man struggling to keep both himself and his mother alive. He begins to question how society works when he rescues a man that is rich in time.  He learns that the reason why prices and taxes have been increasing in his neighborhood is because the bourgeoisie have control and want to kill off the poor because no one can live forever or else there would be overpopulation.  Naturally, Will Salas is the protagonist of the movie with the goal of overturning the way society is run, a typical goal of protagonists in dystopian societies.<br /><br />  Overall, the concept of this movie is very intriguing and hits home in terms of how real the concept of time as currency is in our lives. Its portrayal of a dystopian society is great. It has important aspects of the building blocks that make a dystopian society such as a caste system, a dramatic shift in power, somewhat of a back story leading to a change in societal norms, and a protagonist that questions those in power. I would recommend \\"In Time\\" to anyone looking for a movie with a fresh and clever take on a dystopian portrayal.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its everything I need in a Bible. because I couldn't find a woman devotional Bible, this works just fine. I love it.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|As I've managed to motivate myself enough to actually do this reviewing thing (and on an annoying touch screen keyboard thing too)  you know the game/expansion had to be good. :)<br /><br />Joking aside, I bought the original for my eleven year old, then ended up playing it just as much as she did.  (Damn my perfectionist, must-get-all-three-stars tendencies.)  But that led to glee when I saw the expansion (sequel? Still not sure which it should technically be called.)  But, back to the glee...<br /><br />I personally think that there was plenty of new things to justify making a 'new' game.  The plungers that you can lift and then drop to move the candy piece, the water you get to play around with, the lots of other things I'm not going to mention so all the surprises aren't ruined...All add up Tobago game that is an excellent way to kill time, especially for a mere dollar.<br /><br />(Btw pardon any typos...I really do hate this touch keypad thing and it's want to randomly auto-correct my words to a completely new something I never intended...unfortunately I can't get things to scroll up to manually spell check this review.  /sigh.  /grumble)
0316056871|5.0|You gotta like Tina Fey. She is funny, smart, attractive and honest.<br /><br />  I laughed out loud regularly, yet she had me hanging on her every word as she confronted real dilemmas: managing people, working vs. raising a child, parents and differences between men and women.<br /><br />  Excerpts from scripts fall short when compared to her no-holds-barred observations, for example:<br /><br />\\"Luxury cruises were designed to make something unbearable--a two-week transatlantic crossing--seem bearable. There's no need to do it now. There are planes. You wouldn't take a vacation where you ride on a stagecoach for two months but there's all-you-can-eat shrimp.\\"<br /><br />\\"When a coworker shows me cute pictures of her dog, I struggle to respond correctly, like an autistic person who has been taught to recognize human emotions from flash cards.\\"<br /><br />\\"I dragged all the kids onto the subway and through the crowd to see the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, which is unlike any tree in the world, except for hundreds of trees near their homes in Ohio.\\"<br /><br />  But she can also tear you up with real truths, like: \\"I would tell myself `Once I have the baby full-time to myself, everything will be easier.' And then it hit me; that day was not coming. This `work' thing was not going<br />away.\\"<br /><br />  Too often comics pander to their audiences, as do TV and movies, and we think \\"Oh well, that's just what they have to do to make money.\\" That is until someone like Tina Fey doesn't and is successful.<br /><br />  We not only like her; we want to be her. This book lets us.<br /><br />- J. Lehman, Rosebud Book Reviews.com
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy. I thought it was well written and quite engaging. The best part is that I have this on my Kindle so it was very easy to pick up the next book and continue the tale.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|There are two problems I have with this app.  The first is closing it; as mentioned in other reviews.  The other issue is with visiting other villages.  When you try, it says you need to restart.  When you try visiting again, the same message comes up.  Other than that,  the game is fun,  addictive,  and has great graphics.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great set of books!! I read all 3 in less than 2 weeks!! I wish there were more books in the set!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am addicted to making my village bigger and I try to not let pioneers die! Very fun game to play!
B006Z9K97E|5.0|Wow, this is a difficult book to put down!  I am not one for 'long stints' reading a book but Escape from Camp 14 changed that.  Quite an emotional roller coaster as well.<br /><br />It is just unbelievable what Shin went through inside the camp 14, the subsequent guilt he felt after escaping North Korea for shopping his mother to the prison guards then seeing her executed, thinking about the torture his father went through because Shin escaped and having to crawl over his friend dead body during his escape, the friend that planted the seeds of hope that ultimately leading to Shin's escape from Camp 14.<br /><br />It is also a shame that more is not being done on an international basis to highlight the plight and dire situation inside North Korea and especially these camps.  If there was oil involved I am sure governments would have already found a cause to sort this out but like the book said, South Korean's would like the situation to be resolved but not in their life-time because of the financial burden it would place on them (similar to examples of East and West Germany).<br /><br />It was also sobering to read from the angle of the struggle that Shin faces once out of North Korea, to adjust to a world we all take for granted everyday.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic book and would recommend to anybody who needs a wake-up to issues still faced in the world today but get little air time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this book in the office.  I am not a big reader and usually if I start a book I never finish it.  This book kept me coming back for more and more.  I am now on the third book and wish there were more after that.  This type of book will make me an advide reader.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|The series is fantastic, great plots, great acting, action-packed. The DVD/blue ray also contains bonus such as featurettes and deleted scenes. Can't wait for Season 2 to come out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is as good if not better than the first Fifty Shades.  This book kept me as interested at the first.  I really hope she will keep the shades coming!

B000063V8R|4.0|Here it is! The breakthrough season of The Next Generation. With the addition of collars, all of the officer's now look like they're in adult outfits. Crusher's back with an incredibly absurd hair cut (didn't she learn from the one thing Wesley does right?) The shows music heads in a completely new direction - from synthesized dreck to more ambient and tonal accents.<br /><br />Most importantly the writing moves from space viruses and aliens of the week to more personal character driven stories. This season contains some of the best episodes in all seven, including The Best of Both Worlds and Yesterday's Enterprise. In fact this may be the best season of all seven - even more hilarious as, due to the writers strike that caused a shorten second season and birthed a clip show, the writers had virtually no episodes written.<br /><br />Does that mean it's totally devoid of suck? Well...perhaps on the level on the first two seasons, yes. Still, there are a few episodes interspersed in Season 3 that really don't add much by way of character development or mythology, or are just plain awful.<br /><br />My purpose in writing is to speed someone right to the meat and potatoes of the series. I've marked the bad episodes that lack any details about the overall series mythology \\"skip\\" - the one-offs that aren't necessarily great but might be worth coming back to \\"skippable\\" - episodes that are good or contain required information about the series mythology, \\"watch\\" - and the episodes that would be great in any season \\"must watch.\\"<br /><br />Evolution - Skippable - That darned Wesley falls asleep at his desk while experimenting with microscopic robots called nanites. Instead of eating him they escape and start eating the ships computer. Crusher returns for some nice exchanges between her and Picard. The writing is solid (except for the term \\"food slot\\" - hadn't we already coined the term \\"replicator\\" by now?) Still, this episode is unusual in that it is mostly about the guest star rather than any of the crew, in this case Doctor Paul Stubbs, the astrophysicist whose one chance at greatness is being ruined by the nanites. There are better episodes beyond.<br /><br />The Ensigns of Command - Watch - The crew is contacted by a reclusive race that is colonizing a planet now inhabited by descendants of a lost group of human explorers. Because of radiation on the planet the only person who can beam down is Data. A few common series cliches crop up here including female characters who find Data's childlike obliviousness sexy, as well as stubborn inhabitants of a planet that don't seem to realize: THEY'RE IN THE FUTURE. Everyone can vaporize you from space. Still, this is a pretty good episode in which Data's character grows a layer or two.<br /><br />The Survivors - Skippable - A mystery episode. The crew answers a distress call from a federation colony to find the surface of the planet completely obliterated except for a house on a tiny patch of land. Inside is an elderly couple that refuses to leave despite the barren planet. Meanwhile Troi starts being driven mad by music...and so will you. If not by the music then by Deanna's relentless screaming and crying. It's not a terrible episode by any means except for the taxing requirements placed on Deanna's acting ability. There is a wonderfully chilling moment at the end of the episode when we discover what it is the couple has been hiding, but once you know the secret the episode isn't worth much beyond the final five minutes.<br /><br />Who Watches The Watchers - Watch - A group of scientist are studying a race of bronze age proto-vulcan's when the holographic generator that keeps them hidden from the natives malfunctions. Leland Palmer, one of the proto-vulcans, is injured and in a stupor, sees the Captain and crew saving him. When he comes-to again on the planet he starts a new religion worshipping his god, \\"The Picard.\\" This is a fascinating episode in which the show reveals itself to be almost overtly atheist, or at least anti-religious. In an effort to reverse the damage done by their exposure Picard spends an afternoon giving one of the proto-vulcans a tour of the ship culminating in a wonderful scene where he demonstrates to her how any technology sufficiently advanced enough is indistinguishable from magic.<br /><br />The Bonding - SKIP - If you thought that what the show needed was a fresh infusion of child acting than here is your episode! A redshirt member of an away team dies on a mission. While getting counseled through the loss by Deanna, the away member's son starts to get visits from his deceased Mom. It's not a TERRIBLE episode by any means and there are some nice scenes where Worf, a fellow orphan, tries to reach out to the child. Gabriel Damon, the son, doesn't do an awful job but doesn't really have the acting chops to carry this heavy material. In general, the episode suffers from the same problem most of the other episodes have that focus on a guest star character: it's just not all that interesting.<br /><br />Booby Trap - Watch - This a is mythology episode referenced later. The Enterprise is cataloging the ruins of a planet that was the final battle of two species over a thousand years. The crew happens upon one of their battleships in pristine condition, at the same time fall into the same energy sapping booby trap the crew of the ancient vessel did. To help him figure out a way to escape Geordi recreates one of the Enterprise Warp Drive designers on the holodeck, Dr. Leah Brahams, and becomes attached to her. It's a nice character building episode for Geordi and lingers a lot building chemistry between the crew members. It's a joy to watch Picard's glee over getting to live out a boyhood fantasy he had while building ships in bottles. The \\"relationships on the holodeck\\" theme had been touched on earlier in 11001001 where Riker met Minuet - but unlike where Riker lingered bizarrely over his digital date here the results are muchmore believable when Geordi realizes his infatuation and decides to step away.<br /><br />The Enemy - Watch -  Geordi finds himself marooned on a planet, the captive of an injured Romulan named Bochra. The planet plays hell with their different physiologies, blinding Geordi and paralyzing Bochra. As the episode progresses, Geordi, who has the means to save them both, eventually earns Bochra's trust and willingness to see through mutual hatred. For the most part, antagonists in Star Trek episodes are lacking in complexity. Their evilness tends to lack motivation as they're in the story simply to provide conflict. This episode contains both. The scenes between are convincing exchanges between two people whose dislike is based on systematic cultural propaganda and not each other. However, on the bridge the more prototypical Star Trek conflict is occurring between Picard and the one-armed-Romulan, Admiral Tomalok. Tomolak is the stock xenophobic Star Trek adversary, lying at all times, unreasonable, and reckless - a contrast to Patrick Stewart's measured and even-handed Picard. The nicest bit in the entire episode though occurs with Worf's refusal to donate some mojo in his cells that could save a second Romulan dying in sick bay. Despite numerous pleas from different crew members the writers don't sell Worf out and have him see the error of his ways. Instead Worf refuses and we learn something about his character. The Enemy is a nice episode breaking a bunch of new and interesting ground with only a few of the nagging problems of the first two seasons.<br /><br />The Price - Skip - The Enterprise hosts a group of alien's negotiating for the rights to a stable wormhole. One of the negotiators, Devinoni Rall, who has an uncanny knack what he does, begins negotiating his way into Troi's pants. After Troi lets herself be seduced in several creepy scenes of spectacularly bad chemistry, she finds out that Rall is actually half Betazed too. This presents her the \\"complicated\\"choice of having to protect the creepy unethical negotiator she's now sleeping with or do her job. Simply a bad episode, not a terrible one. Wesley is barely around, Lwaxanna never appears, and Troi never has to cry. Still, it's a shame that often times the writer's only ideas for what to do with a Troi-centric episode in these early seasons is to have her be romanced...badly. The prelude to this cringe-worthy romance between Devin and Troi consists of him coming to her office and within 30 seconds running his hand on her arm and messing up her hair. When I tried that at my last job I ended up unemployed and writing episode guides for 17 year old television shows. WTF Star Trek? You lied to me! (side note: technically this is a mythology episode. There's a scene where two Ferengi get marooned in the Delta Quadrant. They return later in an episode of Voyager. I'm still giving this one a pass though.)<br /><br />The Vengeance Factor - Skippable - The crew is negotiating a peace between a species with butts on their heads and marauders they cast out a hundred years before. The marauders, who look like members of The Kiss Army, are starting to show up dead and one of the servants of the negotiators is the cause. Just kind of a dull episode with a nice premise buried beneath a convoluted setup: The servant in question, Yuta, is a 100 year old genetically altered assassin whose entire life has been about killing. That might have been an interesting premise with implications about personal identity and self-determination. Instead it takes twenty minutes of exposition about this species before we even realize that Yuta matters to the plot at all. There's a nice scene toward the end when Riker confronts her but it isn't worth sitting through the entire thing.<br /><br />The Defector - Skippable - The Enterprise receives a distress call from inside the Romulan neutral zone and comes to the aid of defecting Romulan, Admiral Ja'Rok. Ja'Rok says he has information about a Romulan base in the neutral zone intended to be the spearhead to an invasion. The crew must try to figure out if he's telling the truth. This is another episode focused on someone other than a primary cast member however in this case, thanks to a quality performance by James Sloyan, this one is actually pretty good. In a Romulan-centric season Sloyan brings some diversity to the Federation enemy by playing Ja'Rok as a patriotic countryman who sacrifices everything for what he believes to be the greater good. In his jousts with Picard we see two men who want to trust each other but are too worn by years of cultural hatred. It's all enjoyable and the episode teases some epic-ness-ness but ultimately doesn't go very far, ending up a small blip in the series. A good one to circle back to if you find yourself addicted. One thing that starts to irk me at this point in the series: Why in all the universe is the One-Armed-Romulan the only one the Enterprise always seems to run into?<br /><br />The Hunted - Skippable - While considering a planet's application for entrance into the Federation, the Enterprise becomes involved in the recovery of one of their escaped prisoners. Troi senses he may be more than he seems. Her discovery leads to the Enterprise being embroiled in a conflict between a society and it's cast offs from war. Kind of. James Cromwell (Zerphram Cocrane) plays the Prime Minister of the planet seeking Federation entrance and, while it's nice to see him there isn't a lot for him to do with this part. For the most part the writing in this one is a little misdirected. The action in the story is centered around the prisoner, Roga Danar, running rampant through the ship. The problem is that since the story has painted him as such a martyr we never really feel any sense of danger because we know the writers wouldn't have him kill anyone (though it might have been a little more interesting if he had.) There are some nice Machurian Candidate and brainwashing ideas here that are toyed with briefly when Data and Danar have a conversation about their mutual programming and being more than the sum of their parts. Mostly the episode is about action and the ending is an anti-climax.<br /><br />The High Ground - Skippable -While delivering medical supplies, Beverly gets abducted by terrorists whose enigmatic leader wants her to find a cure for a transport system they use that's killing them. I really WANT to give this one a watch. It's fantastic new ground for the series. Beverly and Finn, the leader of the terrorists, have conversations about the nature of terrorism, the difference between a terrorist and a revolutionary is just the difference between winning and losing. In fact the episode seems strangely pro-terrorist, especially when Data tells Picard that according to his research, terrorism seems an effective way of promoting social change. There's also a nice bit at the end between Picard and Beverly when Beverly thinks they might die and touches on their relationship that's always just below the surface. The problem is the scenes that aren't between Picard, Beverly, and Finn are flat and cliched. In order to provide Finn's intellectual terrorist an adequate counterbalance, there are a number of scenes between Riker and the head of police, Alexana. Alexana is an impassioned officer...a little TOO impassioned - her melodramatic ramblings border on Tasha Yarr's Season 1 suck. And after such interesting discussions on the moral ambiguity of terrorism the writers try and wrap a happy bow around the episode by having a child terrorist lay his weapon down at the end and Riker and Alexana share a platitude. Icky.<br /><br />Deja Q - Must Watch - Q is made human as punishment from the continuum. Picard grants him temporary sanctuary on the ship and assigns Data to follow him for the duration of his stay. This is one of the top ten episodes of the series, easily the best pure \\"Q\\" episode (considering Q-Who was really about the Borg.) Q's brief struggle with being human is funny and incredibly well written. The scenes between John De Lancie and Brent Spiner are addictively watchable and the episodes finale is clever and pitch perfect.<br /><br />A Matter of Perspective - Skippable - Continuing Season 3's overall trend of, \\"Yeah...that was Ok,\\" is A Matter of Perspective. The episode actually begins with a great teaser. The crew is researching the progress of a Doctor Apgar who is looking into harnessing Kreiger waves on a Federation space station. We see the bridge of the ship with the space station on the viewer. Riker's voice comes over communicator saying he's ready to leave. As he does, the space station explodes. After the opening credits, Riker is accused of the Doctor's murder by the local police, whose governmental politics are (GASP) guilty until proven innocent. Picard convinces him to hold an investigation on the holodeck where Riker's visit to the destroyed space station is recreated, as seen by various members of the ship and station personnel. It's an interesting idea but the Riker created in the police recreations is such a mustachio'd twirling lunatic that it kind of ruins any of the suspense in the episode. Part of the promise of the opening tease was that we didn't get to see exactly what happened on the space station, which means that we don't KNOW if Riker is guilty or, short of that, culpable for something. It's an opportunity to at least see the ordinarily blandly stalwart first officer in another light. However about the point that the sheriff's holo-decked version of Riker yells, \\"YOU'RE A DEAD MAN APGAR!!\\" we know the episode isn't going to be revealing any interesting nuances to Riker's personality. It would have been much more interesting had the recreations built a plausible setup based on what we already know of Riker's character. Doesn't matter anyway because Wesley solves the problem for everyone. Swing and a miss.<br /><br />Yesterday's Enterprise - Must Watch - When mostTrek fanatic's I know list their top five, Yesterday's Enterprise is in there someplace. While not one of my personal favorites, it is one of the best hard sci-fi episodes in the series and an incredibly important episode in the show's mythology. The Enterprise is investigating a temporal rift in space when a vessel from the past slips through, altering the present. The Federation is now at war with the Klingons, Tasha is at tactical, Data Worf is gone, and the only one who realizes anything has changed is Guinan.  She pleads with Picard to send the vessel from the past back, something that they both know would mean the deaths of everyone on board. It's a great alternate history kind of story where the ordinarily plushy universe of Trek gets a little more dystopic, including an oddly gory battle at the end. One of the reasons to watch the show.<br /><br />The Offspring - Watch - Data creates his own child, a daughter named L'al. If you haven't seen this one go watch it right now. When you're done come back and we'll talk about it. Seen it? All right. I like this episode but didn't we cover this in Measure of a Man? If Data is a sentient self determining being then it would follow that so is his offspring. Yet here again we have some cliched Federation honcho demanding that an artificial person be moved against their will. It's a contrivance simply to lend the story some conflict and is completely unnecessary and a little anti-climactic given...how the episode ends. The real joy in the story is in Data's relationship with his daughter and exploration of parenting. Had the story really needed a conflict to hold our interests it could have been Data's battle with L'al's \\"sickness\\" throughout the entire episode which eventually resulted in her death. As long as we're splitting hairs here about a decent episode: Hallie Todd's performance as L'al is incredibly grating. She spends most of the episode doing a robot voice rather than exuding the childlike essence that BrentSpiner does so well with. Regardless, it's a wonderful episode and I still get dust in my eyes at it's conclusion everytime. Must remember to not chop onions whenever I watch this one...<br /><br />Sins of the Father - Watch - Worf meets his younger brother and returns to the Klingon homeworld to defend the honor of their father, accused of being a traitor against the empire. This is an incredibly important episode in Worf and the Klingon's story arc. We are introduced to the Klingon government and it's inner-workings, Worf's brother, and the House of Durass. It's all very well and good if you like Klingon's but whenever I watch these episodes I end up fixated on the same thing: How the hell did the Klingon's achieve space travel? They're portrayed as such murdering back-stabbing petulant cave men. It doesn't make sense to me that a species who never appears to demonstrate any intellectual prowess what-so-ever could have even made it to the rocket age. Still, this is one you have to watch.<br /><br />Allegiance - Watch - Picard is kidnapped and replaced with a doppleganger. While the real Picard struggles to figure out a way to escape his prison with three other captive aliens, his double takes the Enterprise into danger. I'm going to use the excuse that this is the first episode that introduces the nausigans...that's why it gets a Watch and not a skippable. The nausigans are an intimidating looking alien that are somewhat significant in Picard's story arc later in the series. Really though I just like this episode. The real Picard ends up in a fascinating Cube-esque scenario he needs to figure his way out of, and his double plays nicely against our expectations of Picard. His scenes are fun and sometimes cringe inducing. The ending doesn't quite provide the payoff that the setup promises but it's still an enjoyable ride in getting there.<br /><br />Captain's Holiday - Watch - In this season's special features there is an interview with Patrick Stewart in which he says that he felt his character was becoming a bit dry. Picard's roll on the show was becoming little more than that of a negotiator - someone who stood on the bridge and talked. Apparently this was the reason for Captain's Holiday: keeping the show's anchor cast member happy.  So, Picard is burnt out and forced to take a vacation by Crusher. He heads to Risa and tries to spend some time reading and relaxing by the pool, but ends up with a woman named Vash searching for a relic left by a time traveler. Frankly, it's a pretty lame episode. There are a couple of nice bits between the crew and the Captain in the first ten minutes but otherwise the story is mostly devoid of humor or any intrigue. There are a pair of time traveler's that are trying to retrieve a relic, a ferengi that I think is supposed to be funny (he isn't), and a makeout session that doesn't make a ton of sense. In fact when Picard kisses Vash, her personality seems so in contrast to his own that it's almost as though he's just doing it to either shut her up or have a fling...which isn't really keeping with Picard's character. It's all kind of a mess but Vash reappears later in this series and another. Watch with a friend or a bottle.<br /><br />Tin Man - Watch - The Enterprise takes a psychic diplomat named Tam Elbrun on board who is to help the crew make first contact with a ship that might be a living being. Tam has a volatile personality sculpted by years of being overwhelmed by his powerful psychic ability he is  unable to turn off. This is an episode you see often in trailers and retrospective's concerning the series. The art design and special effects used to bring Tin Man to life were some of the most interesting in the series to that point. Some of the best music in the series also finds it's way into this one. Tin Man's journey through space isn't painted with loud fanfare or obvious strokes, but with subtle strings and woodwinds almost as though he were a whale floating in the ocean. Howeverwhat makes this episode interesting to me is Tam and his ability to read thoughts that he can't turn off. In his scenes with the crew we see him responding to things the crew say to him out loud as well as what they're saying in their own heads. We get a sense of what an awful, self-esteem destroying life it must have been to be constantly assaulted by the things people think but don't say. It's a compelling and thoughtful episode.<br /><br />Hollow Pursuits - Must Watch - Hollow Pursuits introduces Lieutenant Barclay. Barclay is a new transfer to Geordi's engineering team, shy and reclusive. Geordi can't stand him but is instructed by Picard to draw the reclusive engineer out of his shell just as strange malfunctions begin occurring on the ship. In doing so, Geordi discovers Lieutenant Barclay has a bit of a holodeck addiction. It's a theme that the series has been screaming for since the holodeck gained the ability to simulate people. A holodeck is potentially a more addictive escapist medium than television, video games, or drugs combined. Finally we get an episode that deals with it in a somewhat realistic, if amusing fashion. It's a wonderful episode that digs a layer or two deep beneath the conventions of the universe to consider the ramifications of it's inner workings.<br /><br />The Most Toys - Watch - Data is captured by a collector of rare items named Kivas Fajo who makes the crew believe he was destroyed in a shuttle accident. Perhaps one of the best guest star appearances in the entire series, Saul Rubinek plays Fajo with such energy and self love that it's hard for us not to love him too, despite his status as Data's captor. The best sequences in the episode occur in conversations between Fajo and Data where he tries to make Data behave more like a piece of property than a captive. Fajo's manipulations serve as a wonderful medium for exposing the outer limits of Data's personality that we see only brief glimpses of throughout the series. Despite a mostly humorous tone throughout the episode (due to Saul's giddy performance) the ending has a chilling moment and leaves the viewer to decide what Data might be capable of, as he stares blankly into the faces of his comrades who are wondering the same thing. It's a complex and thoughtful episode.<br /><br />Sarek - Watch - The famous Ambassador Sarek comes on board the Enterprise to negotiate a peace treaty. When he does, strange emotional outbursts begin occurring among the crew and it seems that Sarek's questionable emotional state may be the cause of it. The episode bridges the gap between some of the original shows lore and the Next Generation and there are some fun sequences including a brawl in Ten Forward. Perhaps most famous is a sequence that could have been a throwaway in an otherwise mostly average episode. Picard, under the duress of Sarek's psychic emotional baggage, freaks the hell out and Patrick Stewart shows everyone he could read the classifieds and make it sound like Hamlet. In his rants we hear bits and snippets of events in Sarek's life to which we have no background or insight and yet we feel the anguish and regret of Sarek's lifetime in Stewart's performance.<br /><br />Menage a Troi - SKIP - Lwaxanna, the Ferengi, and Wesley create a trifecta of badness in this slap-sticky scholck ridden monstrosity. Lwaxanna, Troi, and Riker are kidnapped by a horny ferengi that wants Lwaxanna to read his opponents minds and play with his lobes. Wesley saves the day. It isn't season one bad but it's close. As usual in these terrible episodes, Patrick Stewart provides the lone moment of redemption as he's forced to fake a smitten rage at the ferengi to get Lwaxanna back. When he tells Wesley to set course for Betazed at Warp 9, we feel his pain and are hoping for an equally speedy end to the episode. Oh and that plucky Wesley gets a field promotion to ensign. Avoid this mire of misguided camp at all costs.<br /><br />Transfigurations - Skip - Beverly suffers the Florence Nightingale (Lorraine McFly?) over a patient the crew finds crashed on an alien planet. The patient suffers from amnesia and is experiencing a cellular mutation. As the crew investigates this John Doe's past he and Beverly form a bond. There isn't a lot of fun to be had in watching the Dr. Crush on this character. In fact I found her scenes between Troi and Wesley to be a bit shallow as she struggles to make a simple crush sound more profound. It doesn't help that John Doe speaks in slow deep bass like he's just fallen out of a romance novel or a self-hypnosis tape.<br /><br />The Best of Both Worlds Part 1 - Must Watch - One of the top ten episodes of the entire series. The Borg send a single ship toward Earth. At this point in the series the Borg had only been seen in the single episode where Q tossed the ship into their territory. Before the movie and Voyager sapped them of almost all of their fright and intimidation (the shark in Jaws is scariest when you DON'T see him) this was how bad-ass the Borg were. One single vessel could assimilate all of humanity. With this two-parter the show reaches an epic level of story telling not yet seen even in the movies.<br /><br />What do you think the best and the worst episodes from this season are?
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire.  Multiple alarms with no issues.  Countdown feature is nice.  Very customizable.  I tend to keep a charger by my bedside to charge unit while sleeping so battery drain is not a concern for me.
B000063V8S|5.0|Continuing the improvements from the previous season, season 4 of The Next Generation has probably the lowest number of suggested skips the entire series. Beverly's pyramid head is gone and everyone including non-senior staff are in collared outfits. Barclay returns and Data and Geordi almost get girlfriends. Almost.<br /><br />The season starts off strong, wrapping up The Best of Both Worlds and following it with one of my favorite hidden gem episodes in the series. After a lull of a few episodes things pick back up again as the writers setup the finale with Reunion. While season 4 isn't particularly loaded with must-watch episodes, it's probably the most even season in terms of overall quality.<br /><br />My purpose is to speed someone right to the meat and potatoes of the series. I've marked the bad episodes that lack any details about the overall series mythology \\"skip\\" - the one-offs that aren't necessarily great but might be worth coming back to \\"skippable\\" - episodes that are solid or contain required information about the series mythology, \\"watch\\" - and the unforgettable episodes, \\"must watch.\\"<br /><br />The Best of Both Worlds Part 2 - Must Watch - As Locutus and the Borg speed toward Earth the crew struggles to devise a plan to stop them. The conclusion of the two-parter is considered by some to be the pinnacle of entire series. To be sure I think it's a spectacular episode but in hind-sight I wouldn't put it at the head of my personal top ten list. As I mentioned in the previous season what we didn't know at the time was how diluted the Borg mythology would become over time, thanks to Voyager and First Contact. Based on First Contact, we're to believe the Borg Queen was on board? Then there's the notion that the Borg can't function without a member of their collective once indoctrinated, which is immediately violated in later episodes they're featured in. These are petty quibbles. Taken by itself this is a wonderful episode that instantly infused Picardwith depth and complexity not possible at any point previous in the universe.<br /><br />Family - Must Watch - Family would land somewhere on my top five list of underrated episodes. The ship returns to earth for a refit and the crew is given much needed shore leave. For the first time in the series, events from previous seasons have ramifications in a completely different episode. The series becomes an arc. Worf's adopted parent's visit him, concerned about his recent dis-commendation by the empire. Beverly stumbles on a message for Wesley from his Dad. Picard returns home to France, still recovering from his experience with the Borg. The episode holds the distinction of being the only one in the series that doesn't feature a single shot of the bridge and that's sort of an apt metaphor for the episode itself. This is a character building episode devoid of any action. We get a penetrating vision into how the events of the series are shaping the characters we love. It's a tantalizing episode and makes me wonder what might have been if the show had been made today and been allowed to be more serialized.<br /><br />Brothers - Must Watch - This is a pivotal episode in Data's story arc and a good one, if a little uneven. Data appears to be acting oddly before he commandeers the ship. He beams himself down to a planet and is brought face to face with Noonian Soong. Eventually Lore, called in a similar manner as Data, appears and the father and his two sons struggle to rectify some of their differences. Unfortunately the episode suffers from being too short. There is a compelling mystery adventure that consumes the first fifteen minutes of the episode. What's happening to Data? How is the crew going to stop him? Then the character study of Noonian and his two sons for the last twenty five that just completely puts the first story on hold. Maybe this should have been a two parter but as is neither story is given enough screen time and feels only partially fleshed out. Thisis probably the only episode in all seven seasons that Lore does more than mustache twirling. His scenes with Noonian show a depth and longing to his character. It's a window that's open only a brief instant before the story rushes to an inadequate climax. Why was Lore interested in the emotion chip when he already had emotion? Data shows himself to be an ungodly liability to the crew in the first fifteen minutes. Did they really just shrug off him stealing the entire ship because of some latent programming that even he wasn't aware of? There's good stuff here that you have to see but none of it is explored to it's potential and ends up feeling unfulfilling when it's over.<br /><br />Suddenly Human - SKIP - The Enterprise rescues a group of alien soldier children on a training mission and finds an indoctrinated human among them. On Troi's advice, Picard attempts to be a father figure to the young man and ends up paying the price. Man this one sucks. Chad Allen (a regular on My Two Dads, and Doctor Quinn Medicine Woman) plays the boy and goes with \\"Angsty Flat-Talker\\" for his performance choice. I've never seen either of those other shows but his performance here is abysmal and only made worse by pairing him for all his scenes with Patrick Stewart. There's a bunch of awkward \\"alien\\" rituals in the story, some nails-on-a-chalkboard melodrama, and the common Star Trek problem of the aliens looking identical to humans except for a small prosthesis on their noses. Avoid this one.<br /><br />Remember Me - Skippable - Beverly tries to uncover the reason why Enterprise crew members are disappearing, and why she's the only one that remembers them. This is an episode where the buildup is greater than the actual payoff. It IS fun as more and more crew members start disappearing until Beverly and Picard are the last two standing on the bridge together. The loneliness and solitude of it all is something you actually feel watching the episode...until we find out that it was *sigh* Wesley that caused the problem and the writers bring back a Star Trek deus ex machina to fix the problem: The Traveler. Seriously they couldn't have inverted the primary warp transducers or...re-calibrated the primary...something to get her out of the warp bubble. They HAD to bring back the Traveller who essentially just fixes it with MAGIC! Not only that but we come to find out that Wesley is magic too! Fixing the problem with techno-babble is still just making up the solution to the problem but it does so in a way that doesn't utterly violate the established rules of the fictional universe. The reason the Traveller sucks is because he may as well just be Harry Potter waving a wand at the warp drive. Still, the ride here may be worth the ending.<br /><br />Legacy - Skippable - The Enterprise assumes orbit around Tasha Yarr's birth planet to save a missing crew and they discover the sister she left behind, Ishara. Data must work with her and discern whether her motivations to help them are genuine or not. It's tempting to give every Data-centric episode a watch because Brent Spiner infuses them so easily with depth and complexity. However Ishara has a penchant for the cringe-worthy melodrama that made many of Tasha's episodes in the first season so unwatchable. Ishara cares VERY PASSIONATELY for her coalition that we know nothing about (and in fact seems a bit douchey.) It makes it difficult to care about anything she says and a bit mystifying as to why Data seems to care for her in the slightest. Still, there are some good bits here. If you decide to skip at least watch the first five minutes of the episode for a good poker scene.<br /><br />Reunion - Watch - Picard is asked to negotiate a conflict over who is to be the next head of the Klingon high council. Meanwhile Worf is reunited with K'Ehleyr who, unbeknownst to him, has given birth to their son Alexander. Love or hate the Klingon stories, Worf's story arc is an important thread in the overall mythology (especially this season) and makes this one a watch. Ultimately though you'll probably forget this one that's heavy on plot but light on characters and ideas.<br /><br />Future Imperfect - Watch - During a patrol of the Neutral Zone, Riker takes an away team to investigate a strange power source and is overwhelmed by a toxic gas. He awakens 16 years later as Captain of the Enterprise and no memory of the intervening time. This a great concept episode. It's a lot of fun to see where the crew end up, even when we know it probably isn't real. Still, the last third falls apart a bit bringing back the one-armed Romulan and steering the story towards a conclusion that doesn't really live up to the promise of the episodes concept. Regardless, it's a fun ride in getting there. I especially love the way Riker figures out what's going on the first time.<br /><br />Final Mission - Skippable - Wesley and Picard crash on a desert planet. When they finally find water, it is protected by a shield and Wesley must race against the clock to get past it and save Picard's life. This episode will actually make you thirsty. It also holds the distinction of being one of the first Wesley-centric episodes that doesn't get an outright skip. There isn't much here however. The writers toss in an abrasive alien pilot to crash with the two leads and provide some dramatic tension and there's some motherly stressing from Beverly on the Enterprise but nothing ever really goes anywhere. The really promising material, that being Picard's ambiguous relationship to Beverly and Wesley's dead father Jack, remains unspoken and left me wondering again if there might not have been more here had the show been serialized.<br /><br />The Loss - Skippable - The Enterprise gets stuck in the wake of two dimensional beings and Counselor Troi loses her empathic abilities as a result. I'm dying to give this one a SKIP because Troi acts like such a giant sassy-pants ass in the episode. The Loss is split between two stories, one of them a compelling mystery and the other a tedious and annoying character study. The story about how the crew is going to save the ship is actually a fun one. However Troi's run in with \\"disability\\" is so annoying you may throw your remote through the screen. She goes from Queen Compassion to self-entitled emo-narcissist so fast it's as though this hateful egocentric character has been lurking beneath her this entire time. Rather than causing you to empathize and like her more it gives her personality a slightly nasty edge. Watch at your own risk.<br /><br />Data's Day - Must Watch - Data writes a letter to Maddox about a typical day of his which includes a wedding, learning to dance, and a skirmish with the Romulans. The episode is a wonderful departure from the shows conventional narrative. Data's first person narrative structure and the episodes \\"day-in-the-life\\" structure provide a wealth of wonderful insights into the crew and daily activities on the ship. This episode was scripted by Ronald Moore, who wrote a number of good ones and later went on to do the new Battlestar. There are several highlights but my favorite is when Worf and Data help each other pick out a gift for Keiko and O'Brien's wedding.<br /><br />The Wounded - Watch - The Enterprise is fired upon by Cardassians retaliating for the destruction of their outpost by a rogue Federation ship. As a sign of good faith, Picard takes on a delegation of Cardassian's and tries to chase down the rogue ship that is lead by Benjamin Maxwell, O'Brien's ex-captain. This episode cheats the Cardassian's into the series mythology. I say cheats because according to the episode the Federation was involved in a very serious war with them just a year before the episode. As the flagship, you'd have thought the Enterprise would have had more to do with the conflict. Still it's forgivable. Marc Alaimo plays Gul Macet in the episode and later went on to play Gul Dukat in DS9. This is a wonderful character storyof O'Brien and his former captain Maxwell, played wonderfully by Bob Gunton (the warden from The Shawshank Redemption.) In an unusually strong and nuanced performance for a guest star, Gunton delivers through expression and inflection the weight of his choices and mistakes. His final scene is heart breaking, as he and O'Brien sit in a darkened Captain's ready room and reminisce about the war and he finally accepts the inevitable.<br /><br />Devil's Due - Skippable - The Enterprise answers a distress call from a planet whose thousand year contract with the devil is about to come due. The she-devil in question says that the Enterprise is now hers as it was in orbit when the contract came due. Picard requests a mediator and orders Data to arbitrate the dispute. Definitely lighter fare in a pretty heavy season, which isn't a bad thing. There are some fun scenes between Ardra (the devil) and Picard, especially in his pajamas. However the episode requires too much suspension of disbelief, ever for Star Trek. As when Data and Picard are returning to the Enterprise and Ardra makes the entire ship disappear. Given the explanation of her powers later on it seemed dubious to me that the Enterprise would 1. not be able to escape from it and 2. not spot the source of what was making them...erm...disappear. Especially because they overwhelm her so easily (and off camera) later in the story. Still, it isn't a terrible episode and might be worth a viewing if you're not just hitting the high points in the season.<br /><br />Clues - Skippable - Another promising concept episode with an inadequate ending. After passing through a wormhole the entire crew except for Data is rendered unconscious for thirty seconds. When they come to, they begin discovering mysterious signs aboard the ship that things are not as they appear, including Data. It's a fun ride the first time through, staring at Data's glassy eyed expression and wondering what's on the other side of it. However as the mysterybuilds and the time begins to run out, we as the viewers start to realize that whatever is at the end of the mystery isn't going to live up to it's epic promise. And then it doesn't.<br /><br />First Contact - Watch - An Arkonian hospital takes in a patient with five fingers and toes. Meanwhile the government looks to push into space and break the warp barrier for the very first time. In another interesting departure from their more common narrative structure, we don't actually see a federation uniform or hear any of the main cast speak for the first 8 minutes of this episode. In fact the camera never goes anywhere without an Arkonian until we see the Enterprise leaving orbit at the end. It's an interesting vision of what it must be like for a species to discover the universe of aliens that is the Federation for the first time. However much of the story is consumed with dry politics and cliched xenophobia that doesn't hold up to repeat viewing. Still, it's an interesting window into a mission type we don't see too much of throughout the series.<br /><br />Galaxy's Child - Watch - Dr. Leah Brahms comes on board the Enterprise to study changes Geordi has made to the engines she designed. Their interactions don't live up to Geordi's expectations he developed after he fell in love with her on the holodeck in a previous episode called Boobytrap. They put their differences aside though after the ship is latched onto by an energy sapping alien the size of a ship. Geordi's creepy and overly familiar advances towards Brahams are like a train wreck you can't look away from. As the episode creeps closer and closer towards Leah discovering the source of his amorous and stalker-y feelings I find myself wanting to turn it off rather than sit through the incredibly awkward confrontation. The episode uses the \\"ship-in-peril\\" sub-plot as a way of moving the two characters past the disastrous interaction and while in reality I don't think it would save Geordi from a stalker indictment, in the context of the episode I bought it. At the end of the episode Geordi and Leah are friends when she gets up to answer a call from her husband leaving Geordi staring out the window of Ten Forward, forever alone.<br /><br />Night Terror's - Watch - The Enterprise finds the crew of a missing science vessel all dead, save for one catatonic Betazoid. As they try and get to the bottom of what happened crew members begin experiencing nightmarish hallucinations. I love this episode. There are a few genuinely creepy moments throughout (particularly when Beverly is in the cargo bay with the bodies) and the soundtrack stands out from this season as being uniquely moody and atmospheric. It's not without it's share of ham of course. A couple of guest stars turn in painful performances and the flying effect used repeatedly when Troi is dreaming looks downright silly. Still it's a fun and slightly unnerving ship-in-peril episode.<br /><br />Identity Crisis - Watch - The Enterprise investigates the disappearance of several crew members from Geordi's former assignment before coming on the Enterprise. As they start to understand what happened to each member Geordi finds himself wondering if he'll be the victim of the same phenomena. This is a difficult episode to explain as the mystery of why Geordi's crewmates disappeared is given a nice gentle introduction. There's a wonderful moment in the holodeck with some wonderful creep factor based around a single shadow. Because the episode builds so well, when the answer to the mystery is finally revealed it's earned and doesn't feel like a cheat as is the case in a number of others. Low point though with the ultra violet black-light \\"makeup.\\"<br /><br />The Nth Degree - Watch - Lt. Barclay returns as the crew investigates the cause of a malfunction aboard a deep space telescope. When Barclay and LaForge try and study a mysterious probe they find nearby the probe knocks Barclay unconscious. When he comes back Barclay finds all ofhis cognitive abilities as well as his self-confidence begin to grow exponentially. At it's core, The Nth Degree is a pure wish-fulfillment episode: the nerdy uncomfortable outcast becomes the man he always dreamed to be. Barclay's transformation is extremely fun to watch as he goes from a state of constant neuroticism to hitting on Troi, stealing the show in a play, and staying up all night arguing theory with Albert Einstein. It's enough to distract from the episodes stupid conclusion and the source of the alien \\"probe,\\" which is all tacked on in the final three minutes: Alien explorers bringing the galaxy to them rather than going out and exploring it themselves. How is it these aliens aren't fighting a hundred wars with pissed off species whose incompatible technology got wrecked? Ah well, still a decent episode.<br /><br />Qpid - Watch - In an effort to repay a debt to Picard for saving his life, Q places Vash and the crew in a recreation of Robin Hood and his merry men. It's an incredibly dumb episode not really worthy of any analysis. This same year this episode came out Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was released (Kevin Costner's followup to Dances With Wolves.) I doubt it was a coincidence. Vash and Picard still have zero chemistry and even Q seems wasted once the ham-tastic Robin Hood sequence begins. Still there's enough humor here to make it watchable (With John De Lancie there usually is) and, bizarrely the writers bring Vash back AGAIN in a DS9 episode later on which I guess technically makes this a mythology episode.<br /><br />The Drumhead - Watch - During an investigation of a warp core explosion and the sale of top secret schematics to the Romulan's, the federation brings in Admiral Norah Satie. The admiral begins to unfold what she believes to be greater and greater web of conspiracy. Occasionally there are ambitious episodes in the series that, for better or for worse, try and make some kind of social commentary. In this case it's mostly for the better. Admiral Satie's search for Romulan spies aboard the ship is a cold war paranoia metaphor that works until the last act where it becomes so overt she nearly transforms into a mustache twirling McCarthy. However the show got a strong English actress in Jean Simmons to carry the roll. So often Patrick Stewart dwarfs his guest stars but the last scene in this episode between Jean Simmons and him crackles.<br /><br />Half a Life - SKIP - Lwaxanna Troi falls in love with a man who has reached the age where it is custom among his people to commit suicide. I'm going to be very honest here. Full disclosure. I'm not a hundred percent certain that I've ever made it all the way through this episode before, front to back. I've seen it in fits and spurts and probably watched all of it cumulatively over many attempted viewings. I find Lwaxanna such a depressingly terrible character and Majel Barrett's acting so irritating that I've never sat through it one sitting. There ARE some good elements here and it makes the whole episode feel like such a waste. David Ogden Stiers is a wonderful character actor and turns in a fine performance as Timicin, the man Lwaxanna falls in love with. This could have been thoughtful metaphor about trying to reconcile cultural differences so vast they may be irreconcilable (say, female circumcision or various religious practices.) Why they chose THIS plot with such a mind-bogglingly awful character as Lwaxanna (who it's hard to believe anyone could fall in love with let alone refrain from jettisoning out an airlock) is unknown.<br /><br />The Host - Watch - Beverly falls in love with an alien ambassador who's personality is actually the total of two different organisms, the host body and the symbiotic organism inside of him. When the negotiator's host body is injured Riker takes the symbiote on to finish the ambassador's mission and Beverly must struggle to understand her...I dunno. Own feelings. Or something. All right so this episode isn't quite in my wheelhouse. It isn't the fact that the episode is romance heavy, it's that the romance isn't based in character, just a bunch of readily available cliche. The entire romance between the two of them occurs off-camera. We never really get to know who Ambassador Odan is and there isn't anything new revealed about Beverly that makes the romance between the two of them interesting or believable. There might have been potential here to learn about Beverly's relationship with Jack or something that would have brought some dramatic tension. Still, this episode introduces the Trill, an important species in DS9 and there are some nice thoughts as to the physical and spiritual nature of love and sexuality. There are also some nice scenes between Beverly and the other crew members and a great ending. Oh and Riker and Bev boink, presumably while Geordi sits in Ten Forward still staring out the window. Still forever alone.<br /><br />The Mind's Eye - Must Watch - Geordi is brainwashed by the Romulan's in order to assassinate a Klingon leader and breakup the alliance between the Klingon's and the Federation. The episode is an obvious nod to the Manchurian Candidate and foreshadows some of the events to come in Redemption Parts 1 and 2. There are some chilling scenes when Geordi is being held captive by the Romulan's and a nice tense race to the finish. Good one to watch.<br /><br />In Theory - Watch - On the advice of the senior crew, Data enters into a romantic relationship with a fellow crew member and the ship pointlessly gets into peril to keep everyone's attention for 45 minutes. I just kept thinking two things while watching this: 1. The senior staff must really not like this woman if they're telling Data to return her advances. Why would they think a romantic relationship with someone completely incapable of emotions actually be good for her? And second, why did the writers feel it necessary to include the dark matter ship-in-peril plot? Ultimately all it does is steal screen time away from a significant development in one of the most loved character's story arc. Quibbles aside, as usual Brent Spiner's performance is compulsively watchable and this story is a poignant one. By the end when the inevitable happens and Jenna leaves Data's quarters we're left with a long shot of him stroking Spot and we're not certain who to feel sorry for.<br /><br />Redemption Part 1 - Must Watch - A civil war threatens the Klingon Empire and Worf has to choose between his between his duties as a Star Fleet Officer and loyalty to his people. It doesn't get much more important than the season ending two-parters. This episode introduces the Durass sisters, nullifies Worf's discommendation, puts Gowron in charge of the empire, and introduces a familiar looking Romulan. They dump so much money into these season finales that the space battles are pretty epic. I still stand by my criticism that the Klingons behave like such neanderthal's that they never should have made it into space. Where are all the nerdy Klingon scientists anyway? But I digress. In truth it's a pretty well written episode until the very last cringe-inducing line.<br /><br />What do you think were the best and worst episodes are from this season?

1582701709|5.0|This is a life-changing book. I used to have such depression and anxiety that the smallest things would affect my emotions, at one point I had thoughts of suicide, I couldn't even drive.<br /><br />I have been through things I was uncomfortable sharing with ANYONE, not a family member, friend, or therapist. So when anyone told me to be positive and gave me examples of other people who had gone through hardship and were positive, I didn't listen because they had no idea the reasons for my unhappiness. I was so moved by the stories featured in The Secret, all the teachings make sense, and I now finally see the power of positive thinking.<br /><br />My life basically used to be a mess. I now have a job I love, anxiety isn't taking over my life (so nice to be able to just drive!), and things just keep getting better. I enjoy my life each day and am more confident than ever that I can make my dreams come true. I don't think anyone knew the depth of my depression, but people can still see the difference in me!<br /><br />I'm not going to say EVERY single thing in life now makes sense to me, but about 99% of it does. The teachings in this book are truly inspiring. Rhonda Byrne, thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for this book and also for The Power and The Magic. Words can't begin to express my gratitude to you, and I wish you continued success.
B0045INOCO|5.0|Extremely late to the party of course on this one. I just watched Apocalypse Now and I'm aware that I'm not going to bring anything new or original to the analysis of the content so let me just get my impression out of the way and movie on: this is an amazing movie.<br /><br />Spectacle in modern film comes cheap. When I go to the movies today and see cityscapes with flying traffic, long shots of enormous crowds, famous landmarks incinerated in disaster films, or dogfights high above a besieged city, it all lacks the impact knowing that 99 percent of what I'm looking at was generated on a computer screen rather than an actual set. There is value to knowing that what we're seeing exists in some fashion even if it's a model on a table at ILM. Apocalypse Now has so many shots that are crammed with detail. Especially at the beginning of the movie there are shots with a dozen helicopters, tanks, and crowds of soldiers running through. I'd like to think that awe I felt at the spectacular undertaking it must have been to achieve those shots is an approximation of what that might feel seeing it in reality. It's a much more uniquely magical feeling than anything constructed in the digital universe.<br /><br />It isn't just spectacle though. The movie is gorgeously shot. As Captain Willard's odyssey gets deeper and deeper into the jungle the movie starts to drown in ethereal smoke and vapor. I was amazed by how many times I could have paused the movie and had a beautiful still. The Redux edition has gone through a technicolor process that has created a deeply saturated look for the entire film.<br /><br />The story is wonderful. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Willard's journey is like the gradual on-come of intoxication. The imagery in the films opening act is crisp and bright. As the characters near the end of their outward journey, a metaphor for their journey into themselves, the shots are doused in smoke and darkness. The movie is pitch perfect and though it's very long, the passaging of time was unnoticeable for me.<br /><br />That is, except for the Redux addtions. The original Apocalypse Now was two hours and ten minutes long. The Redux edition features 50 minutes of restored footage which bumps the movie to just over the three hour mark. The voyage into the dark hearts of men proceeds beautifully, until at about just over halfway through there's a new addition. In the sequence the voyagers on Willard's boat come to a trashed medivac station and find the Playboy bunnies hanging out there, presumably waiting out a bad rain storm. Willard trades gasoline for time with the bunnies and what follows is a bizzare sequence where the two women babble nonsensically while men slowly and remove their clothes and pose them in positions. At one point while a soldier and one of the women are about to have sex they knock a casket off a table which falls open revealing the naked body of a soldier. Obvious symbolism aside, the scene doesn't work. The women behave so bizzarely and the dialogue is so odd that the whole thing feels haphazard and out of place compared to the silky darkness of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Later in the film, virtually right before Willard finds Kurtz, the crew of the boat run into some French colonialists. What follows is a long LONG dinner party with the Frenchman where they get into an argue about politics. Willard then gets high with one of the women who tells him he has two side: one that loves and one that hates. This far into the film it was as though the little boat I'd come to feel like a passenger on hit an iceberg. And that iceberg was France. All the forward momentum and intoxication of the narrative is almost wrecked on it's shores. The journey, which up until this point has occurred through symbolism and action bogs down in this talky expository mess. A story as epic as this can't be ruined by two scenes but it certainly made me wish I'd seen the movie without them. Eventually the crew climbs back into their boat and finishes the journey, finding Colonel Kurtz (an already swelling Marlon Brando) and their destiny.<br /><br />I tried comparing Apocalypse Now to the other war films I've seen but the difficulty is (and the mistaken assumption I believe lead to reinserting the French sequence) that I don't really believe Apocalypse Now is a war film. If so, unlike other war films, the fact that it is is incidental. What matters is it's one of the most well assembled, completely engrossing stories about the darker facets of man's inner natures and could have occurred at any point in history. Definitely one of my favorite films.
1439181780|5.0|The Secret is mostly about positivity/law of attraction. The Power introduces the importance of love, which I never took seriously before. (The message of the power of love always seemed to be given to me in a cheesy/romantic way.) I now do my best to love as much as possible. It's made a huge difference in my life.<br /><br />I didn't think this would compare to The Secret, but I honestly don't know which book I love more! If you love The Secret, buy this!

1451648537|5.0|This is an incredibly well written book that is very hard to put down.  More than anything else, Steve Jobs saw himself as an artist and perfectionist with a definite mental imbalance that made him very, very hard to deal with.  This is an uber complete look at Jobs' life and his triumphs and failures.<br /><br />Was Steve Jobs a visionary?  That certainly cannot be argued.  A great man?  I am not so sure, it all depends on how you define the word great.  He made the world a better place with his contributions, but he hurt a lot of people in doing so, coworkers, friends, family.<br /><br />What truly makes a person great?  I don't have the answer, but I know a great book when I see it, and this is it.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B002MQYOFW|5.0|LOVED this book!  It is an easy read with a fascinating and imaginative story.  I just started on the second book in the series.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|was a good video, it made you tink alot, and was okay, I have recommended it to a friend, but not the normal tom hanks movie
0316098329|5.0|Like many excellent books I've read, this one was recommended by my daughter.  She gave me a short rundown of the plot and I felt some reservations about reading it.  I am very glad I listened when she encouraged me to give it a go.<br /><br />'Room' is a startingly poignant book that deals with a very difficult situation in a surprisingly captivating manner.  The story telling is rich, sometimes humorous, sometimes heartbreaking, yet full of hope.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading more works by this author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have purchased the book after hearing about it from a friend, and read what it was about on the internet, so I have downloaded it but have not read it yet
B002RKRTGO|3.0|A strange family legend combined with a mysterious death, add some other elements that aren't easily explained and you have the makings of a case that piques Sherlock Holmes' curiosity. This story is primarily set on the moors of Devon in England, the perfect backdrop for a creepy legend.<br /><br />  I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with this story from Arthur Conan Doyle. As a lover of mysteries, I had been looking forward to reading a Sherlock Holmes story. But Holmes was absent from most of this book as Watson is on his own for a good portion of it.<br /><br />  The Kindle version that I had was also missing some pertinent parts of the story, which I had to look up online to not be completely lost. And while the mystery they were solving was hardly over exciting, it was still a very enjoyable read with plenty of twists and turns to the plot.
B002ZG976U|5.0|do not have the video yet, but I watched it this week end and it is a good clean movie, you do not find to many of these anymore.  the music that is is the video is terrific and I had to order it as well
B000RH0C8G|5.0|If you like baseball and like to read about innovative people that are willing to fly in the face of conventional wisdom, get this book!  Billy Beane put it all on the line when he began analyzing how things are valued in a very different manner than people in his industry did for MANY years before him.  Billy might say differently, though.  He might say he didn't put much on the line because he had no choice but to follow what he believed in.  NOT following what you believe in represents the greater risk, is what I think he believes.  This innovative approach toward the valuation of commodities can and should be applied across many other industries.  It's very much a business management book wrapped around one of my favorite subjects--baseball.  Michael Lewis is phenomenal, IMO.  Everything he writes is very readable, as long as you're interested in the subjects he covers.  He's forthright and articulates the essence of his subject as good as any author writing today.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|love it, I have watched all of the downton Abby series, and cannot wait for the series three to come out, I have the book below stairs that I am reading now, and I really enjoy the series
B0071R43MG|4.0|Satriani delivers the goods with \\"Satchurated.\\"  I find most DVD concert releases to be fairly boring.  Not so with this release.  It's a bit long at just over 2 hours but hey, who's complaining.  It's Satriani at his best.  Joe has managed to put together a really great bunch of guys who love what they are doing.....and it shows.  The overall production gets an A+, performance an A+, and the song selection an A.<br /><br />Yeah, there were some other tunes I would have liked to have had on this set but, what is here is astounding.  Joe and the guys manage to keep a pretty good energy level throughout this effort.  I think that is what dooms most recorded concerts.  You lose interest in it as you get bogged down with slow tunes and songs that you could care less about.  No so here.  Thanks Joe!!<br /><br />Looking for something else that kicks booty and will keep your attention?

0375826742|3.0|As another tome necessary in the process of telling the author's story, it fulfills his expectations, I think, quite adequately. The continuation of a grand war of many against an overwhelming evil is carried out quite well. As the arrogant and despicable Galbatorix wants more power over all aspects of people's lives, the comparison with today's world of governments that want the same, is impossible to ignore. What this volume provides is hope in the heart of those who wish to preserve their individual freedoms and thwart this devilish-seeming invulvnerable grasp for power and to fight it effectively requires persistence, guile and the transparency of truth to win out against the heavy hand of overgovernance.<br /><br />The action scenes are good, but some of the description of events like coronations and long-winded discussions of strategies seem, at times, like the author has become very unfocused and susceptible to currents of vague mistiness resulting in a lack of clarity.  Three areas that more specific development would help (not through the use of many, many, many words, but using brief words of clarity) are those of more romance, effective characterization, and a diminution of Eragon's unending self-doubt.<br /><br />Really, unless we are talking about prepubescent teens as the main readers, romance and physical attraction should have been inserted into the main themes of this weighty novel, making it more grounded in people's reality and desires, and our ability to grasp the story. There are characters calling out for these encounters, such as between Eragon and Arya, Angela and...someone, etc. that would flesh out this lack of content that would help us believe more strongly in the 'reality' of this fantasy.  The lack of its insertion makes me think there is a bit of arrested development in the whole conception and implementation of the story, that keeps it from taking on substance and leaves the misty mindedness that is good for only the early developmentof a story. Let there be romance in all of our life, else we are bereft of a human (or elf) quality that we can identify with and understand, and give us a more full-fleshed reality to bring this story into our hearts.<br /><br />The second area needing help is the characters. Yes, there is a lot of character development, too much that is lightly done and superficial, so that it is easy to lose sight of who's who in such a long story, and results in a lack of true caring by the reader for them. Again, this is an example of the stupefying quantity of characters provided, instead of a true focus on a few characters developed fully, to give us reason to care about their well-being. The book did not do a quality, thorough, character development early, so we can see the main individuals clearly, touch them and breath in their body aromas in words that clearly leave us excited about them (whether for good or bad).  Later the author should've continued developing them in small ways throughout the story, as needed to full develop them, but using quality development in brief reactions to events, strengths or weakenesses that are charming and endearing, not those that weaken the character. Re-characterizing poorly developed individuals in a later chapter (going over the same traits in a lackluster way) is not giving your readers the credit they've already understand those traits and carry them forward with them. Shouldn't have rehashed the lightly done traits again and again.<br /><br />The last is the seeming need for long-winded explanations of the protagonist's self-doubt. If you have someone who is human you always have self-doubt. But at times the author brings this internal questioning to a point that it almost seems like torture.  Who in the right mind would want to follow such a self-effacing, effeminate leader who purports to be a major leader? It is the personal strength of character and leadership that people follow. Instead the author tends to use artifice such as magic to account for almost everything that is harder to develp and explain. Perhaps the reason for the weakness of Eragon is based in the unfortunate weaving of one of today's destructive presences, PC thought, that makes it difficult to really admire someone like Eragon. There seems to be such a leavening of PC thought that contaminates this whole work, and at times, makes me want to scream, 'Enough!' and throw the book down for days at a time, before picking it back up and, hopefully, believe that it isn't really as prevalent and destructive to a book I so  much want to admire. Less PC and more true humanity.<br /><br />I gave it three out of five, but, if I were in a period of mood blackness due to the aversion to PC thought, I could have easily gone to a two star level. Clearly, that would've been unfair to the parts of the book that are very well done. Compromise is ever a part of what we do in today's world, unfortunately, instead of reaching for true perfection.
0345803493|5.0|I was hesitant to even start reading this series.  I am not a twilight fan and I don't care for bondage.  But after the first chapter of the first book I was hooked.  This second book was my favorite!

0345803485|5.0|I love this whole series.  I was hesitant to read it when I first heard what it was about because I am not a twilight fan nor am I into bondage.  But I had to see what all the hype was about.  After the first chapter of the first book I was hooked.  Yes there is a lot of sex in the book, but I think there is a lot more to the story.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this one after I had read the 50 Shades of Gray series.  It was a good transition after not being able to get enough of the others.  The story was good with a few twists and turns that left me unable to put the book down.  You have the sweet innocent girl with the bad boy.  Who doesn't love a good challenge in a romance?
B000MV8XPG|5.0|My son got this for his 3 year birthday.  He loved it and wanted to play with it right away.  We have a beach / pond in our yard and that is perfect.  Want to use it in winter months too with snow.  He will need some practice getting familiar with the levers but loves it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am only about 25% of the way through it, and I don't understand why it's as popular as it is.  The main character, Ana, is incredibly boring and lifeless.  There is nothing interesting about her; she basically is Bella Swan from Twilight.  Christian is very controlling over her life and she won't stick up for herself, which makes me very annoyed at Ana while reading the book!  The writing is bad and lacks emotion.  I have read MUCH better erotic fanfiction than this, and it's unfortunate that those talented authors won't receive the same kind of recognition that this author is.
B003L16FAE|4.0|I have been upgrading some of my DVDs to Blu-Ray, and Predator was a movie that I wanted to see in hi-def.  But the reviews mentioning a bad transfer scared me away. Well, I have now seen the \\"Ultimate Hunter Edition,\\" and the transfer was very good.  Apart from a scene early in the movie, where Carl Weathers appears to have waxy skin, the rest of the movie is crisp, and the colors are vibrant.  I am thinking that the negative reviews refer to a different transfer of the movie.  The Hunter Edition is fine.  Unless you are extremely fussy about video quality, you will be pleased.
0345803485|4.0|I decided to read this book after hearing many raves from friends.  Not only did I read this one but I read all three within a week.<br /><br />They were very entertaining and erotic a welcome escape from a crazy hectic life.  A passionate love story off to a rocky start that eventually worked it's way out, predictable but you knew that's how it would end up.<br /><br />Alot of similarities to Twlight but again I knew that going in.<br /><br />All in all pretty good.

B005NKGEP2|5.0|I listened to this twice about 6 weeks ago- and it lingers- as an influential friend.  Although I am a generation older, the feelings expressed here were genuine and worth re- exploring.  Yes, these heros represents a tiny segment of priviledged- taking an international assignments that lead up to future promotions-part of the checklist that only a tiny segment achieves in our corporate hierarchies. Taking a Mommy Track- after a long time in a position of trust is complicated as this story illuminates. This is an extra special listen/read

0345803485|1.0|OK so I read and heard so much about this series of erotica, that I coughed up the $9.99 to read on my Kindle. In retrospect, I realize I was ripped off. This book is basically sex. And after the first few sexual encounters, it is ...well, quite frankly BORING sex, no matter how kinky and how many toys are involved.<br />The plot is thin. The author tries to convince the reader that the protagonist came from a dark childhood, but doesn't lay down any facts supporting the claims, and Christian Grey is such a creepy character that I , the reader, suspect most of the lines he feeds Anastasia are lies and total crap anyways.<br />The protagonist is purportedly a wealthy businessman and philanthropist....by investing in sustainable agriculture??? Hard to believe. Anyways, the bottom line is....this book was a total waste of time. Ladies, don't cheapen yourselves by reading it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very convenient, and useful. It's beautiful to look at, and it has a lot of options that makes studying easier and enjoyable. It also has audio, but you need an internet connection to listen (I think), and to read some versions. Sometimes they have offers where you can download the more popular versions...that's pretty cool.
0316017930|2.0|I found Outliers fascinating. . .BUT was disappointed that Mr. Gladwell downplayed individual characteristics that contribute to successs.  After all, many persons were the children or grandchildren of Jewish immigrants; many thousands of babies are born every year, including years with relatively low birth rates; many children graudated from Bill Gates' private school at or around the same year he did. . .BUT something - in addition to blind luck - was special about the very few who, unlike their peers, became remarkably successful. Those special few who became remarkably successful were willing to practice for 10,000 hours, saw an opportunity that others over-looked or ignored, had a parent or parents who inspired potential, had a personal standard of excellence, were willing to take risks, addressed a common need or problem in a unique way, etc.  The book would have been more honest and helpful if it had devoted more attention to the personal characteristics that make the remarkably successful able to take advantage of \\"being in the right place at the right time.\\"
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This movie, while it has a \\"B\\" movie feel, may have some \\"horror-esc\\" scenes, but for the most part it is a comedy. My husband was up late and watched it one night, and the next day was insistent that I had to stay up and watch it with him, and am I glad I did. I never stopped laughing, and as someone else has already pointed out, the hillbillies in this story are the innocent parties, and the college kids are just plum crazy. While to some extent they college kids and hillbillies are your stereotypical types, but on the other hand, it is the stupid ignorance and innocence of the hillbillies and the ridiculous ideas of the college kids, that gets them all into trouble. Suffice it to say, what this movie lacks in big name actors and budget,is made up ten fold with the story line and hilariousness of the scenarios that poor Tucker and Dale are thrust into, in most cases unwittingly. Definitely one to not miss!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this book because it's received a lot of hype and, if you can believe the media, has sadly provoked introspection in women everywhere. For those of you with daddy issues (or low serotonin levels), yes, Christian Grey will consume your mind, day and night and leave you wondering where you might find someone remotely resembling him. Well, stop looking because he doesn't exist. And if he did, he would not be \\"dating\\" a plain, inexperienced girl that works in a hardware store or anyone in their thirties or forties for that matter. So enjoy the book for it's extreme fantasy genre and stop glaring critically at your husbands and boyfriends over dinner wondering how you ended up with someone lacking the passion, money and looks of Christian Grey.

B0064BWDRW|1.0|Having read all of Nesbo's previous Harry Hole books, I was excited when I purchased his latest book called \\"Phantom\\". The first 30 pages are entertaining and promises a great deal through Nesbo's usual (and entertaining) method of building up suspense and mystery, leaving you wondering where this is going. Unfortunately, this time you keep wondering, the story never really takes off, a broad mix of parallel stories sort of come together in a bit of a mess. Arsenal soccer shirts and the name Dubai is mentioned so many times that you really feel like injecting Violin yourself , just to get some sort of a buzz. I like Jo Nesbo, I still do, but next time I will read more reviews before buying the book.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|Outstanding movie! This was a great surprise.<br /><br />As a \\"fighting movie\\", it was refreshing to see true depth to a story outside of the ring in parallel to the one taking place inside. The acting was phenomenal by Edgerton, Hardy, and Nolte, though Hardy stole it for me (this guy is amazing). The music was right on cue and fit the scenes. The fight scenes were good enough get out of my seat and cheer. The drama was masculine, a bit dark, and cauldron deep.<br /><br />I love that there was NOTHING gratuitous or cheap in this movie. In a day where movie makers try too hard to appeal to all demographics and end up cheapening what could have been a great movie (Transformers), this sets a new bar for balance. The fight candy only enhances the drama, and vice versa. I saw little in the way of compromise in either. With a strong story and good actors, you really don't need CGI, sex, F-bombs every other word, etc.<br /><br />To beautifully wrap up a great movie, the two stories fully converge in THE MOMENT. It is in the final fight and is the true climax of the movie. As a man, that moment is unmistakable, unforgettable, and unbelievably powerful, because it was impossible not to be strongly sympathetic to the characters by that time. It was expertly built up and served to make the fight become progressively gut wrenching and sad as we recognize what winning will actually cost the other. Though, unfortunately, losing still did not seem to be an option, given the noble reasons both were supposed to be fighting for in the first place.<br /><br />I also saw the last fight as a culminating metaphor for life. The message relating to how much of our pain and anguish is self inflicted, though many of us still double-down in treading our path alone and on our own terms, notwithstanding our misery. Eventually there comes a point where we may recognize that the true cost of \\"doubling-down\\" is actually greater than \\"tapping-out\\" (conceding, forgiving, repenting). In such a moment of great fear and vulnerability, we need someone to comfort us, someone to make it ok to let go. Only then can we see that true \\"victory\\" (peace, joy - whatever that may mean to us) was never to be found alone. For this reason, the fight was absolutely necessary to complete the story. This is also why I think most viewers, including myself, at least got \\"a bit choked up\\" in this scene.<br /><br />It is not every day that you see a profoundly counterintuitive spiritual principle masterfully captured by a \\"fight movie\\", or any movie for that matter.<br /><br />I hadn't even heard of this movie until yesterday. Lucky me!<br />Lucky you, if you watch it.
076115678X|5.0|I ordered this book last week along with a travel size kit of DevaCurl hair products directly from Devachan's online store. (I chose to do this after reading all of the reviews about watered down hair-products ordered through third party distributors via Amazon). I am SO glad I did! 5 days after they have arrived - my hair is looking and feeling better than ever!<br /><br />I accepted years ago that I had curly hair and was trying to do all I could to make my natural curly hair work for me - accepting that some days I was going to manage to pull off a good hair day and most days perhaps not. And on the odd special occasion (like after a visit to the salon) I was going to enjoy a blown out straight-do.  NO MORE! Honestly, this book and all the amazing advice contained within it is slowly changing my life! And yes, I realize it's only been 5 days, but seriously, my curls are more defined and feel more healthy than they ever have. I am forever done with sulfate-shampoos, hairbrushes, and salon stylists who are only trained in cutting straight hair. I can't wait to have my current razor-ed/thinned out layered do grow out and see what the full potential of my curls really is! Nothing has ever made me this excited about my hair before - I just had to share! I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone with curly or wavy hair and to any stylist / hair dresser out there.

Sylvia Plath's prose, plotting, character development, and sheer brilliance left me riveted. As others have written, it did remind me of one of my other favorites, \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" These two works complement each other nicely. I can only imagine what she would have written had she not suffered an early death....she was a great writer and deserves all the accolades that critics deliver.

I watched both versions to see if the DVD was missing footage it's such a huge difference. I'm not switching to all Blu-ray I have too big a DVD collection but I'm totally convinced on this movie that it's better! If you love it, you need to see it at it's best. If you haven't seen it watch it on Blu-ray, it'll make you sing along.
0307346617|1.0|I don't want to go off on the author for this book, but it really wasn't my cup of tea. For the sake of not feigning originality I have to echo what other people say about the format of the book. I felt that as soon as I was getting into a story it ended, along with my patience. In my humble opinion if there was a fraction of the amount of \\"interviews\\" the book would have been a lot better. I was down for the whole chronological account of the war, but felt the story could have been that much better (without compromising its integrity) by having several stories from several characters, which at some point or another linked, either with or without the characters awareness. The easiest way to solve this riddle if you're interested in this book: sit down in the shop and give it a 10 min read. You'll know for sure if the style  blows your skirt up.  I don't know what I was thinking when I listened to someone who likes Rocky 5.

0553801473|1.0|Don't bother wasting your time if you fell for the drawn-out teaser that was book Four. None of the characters you were following through the first three books and even into the fourth move along here, so there's no point in reading it. Want to find out what happens to Bran and his siblings? (Jon apparently winds up dead, killed by his inner circle. Same fate as too many other characters, ho hum) The other families? All those yarns at loose ends are just left fluttering.<br /><br />Yes, that's correct. No satisfying conclusion awaits and about two dozen NEW characters are added instead, as if the author got tired of the old ones from the first four books and rather move along and then wrap up their stories he just ignored them completely. Not sure which is more disgusting, the sloppy and tedious writing or the utter disrespect to the readers he's dragged along through thousands of pages previously only to arrogantly leave hanging...as if we are all going to rush out for his next book to get what we didn't in this one. Sorry. Fool me once, I might try again. But the final two books were so worthless and the quality so lacking, there isn't any point in bothering with another.<br /><br />Such a shame. These characters and story premise deserved an engaged writer who cared about his craft, not someone just filling pages with the same tediously repetitious situations as if he's tossing darts at a page of the following options: violent and senseless death, introduce new character, boring sex scene, gratuitous violence, introduce new character, implausible escape, introduce new character, or feast scene.

I hate it when writers try to make their writing so fancy that unless you are a harvard grad you don't know what the hell they are saying - this book was detailed but completely understandable. LOVED it. Watched the movie in my mind. Wish I could see what Travis and Abby are up to now :-).

0553386794|3.0|Writing Quality: 6/10.<br />Martin is a fine writer. Not great, but his prose doesn't have most of the really egregious mistakes that a lot of other bestselling fantasy writers have, whether we're talking about Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, or worst of all, Terry Goodkind. At the same time, I don't think a single phrase in the book struck me as anything worth remembering, and that's something I usually look for. Tolkien, by comparison, doesn't have much more ability as a wordsmith, except that every once in a while he used a turn of phrase that stuck tenaciously in his readers' heads, after years or even decades (\\"All who wander are not lost,\\" for instance). I almost scored Martin a 5 (which would put him a point lower than Tolkien in The Fellowship of the Ring), but then I decided he employed a really exceptional ability to weave together varied character story lines so that they all felt connected and driving towards a common end (which Tolkien struggled with, I think).<br /><br />Depth of Concept: 6/10.<br />I debated whether this was a 6 or a 7, and ultimately chose a 6 even though Martin clearly is exploring original concepts and making a legitimate bid for breaking out of the typical fantasy formula, which so few of his bestselling peers bother to do. This is a detailed world with complex themes involved, feeling as though it's lifted straight from the power struggles of the War of the Roses. In any given character you'll find competing impulses of ambition, loyalty, love, selfishness, nobility, and cowardice. Nevertheless, it's still not a very subtle work. A 6 means that Martin is intelligent and his story presents issues that are worthy of stopping for a minute to think about.<br /><br />Rounded Characters: 6/10.<br />Martin's character development is a cut above most writing in the fantasy genre, especially those hitting the bestseller lists. Most of the comments in the above category could apply here as well. Still, you don't find characters really learning or changing in particularly insightful ways, only adapting logistically as situations arise. You don't have a Gollum character to carry the nuanced weight of tragedy and redemption, or an Ishmael/Ahab binary to explore the metaphysically ambiguous limits of devil and savior, or a character like the Man in Cormac McCarthy's The Road who experiences with heartbreaking tenderness, pain, sacrifice, and love in the context of a hellish world. Martin's characters are respectably rounded, but rarely exceptional. There are also A LOT of characters, though it didn't take me too long to settle into the detailed world of warring families and dynasties.<br /><br />Well-Developed World: 7/10.<br />Although Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series unabashedly uses the British Isles and surrounding lands as its model, it does so in just the right amount to help us situate our understanding of the world, and then adds in many delightful analogs and divergences. It's almost an alternate history, but without relying excessively on the real-world source as a crutch. It's an appreciable re-imagining that allows us to incorporate our historical understanding of the land with more fantastic elements, and it's a really engaging setting that uses the geographical and climate differences of different regions to justifiably forward the plot. This is a world that hints at the reality of magic and otherworldly elements, but that lives or dies by its political intrigue and power shifts, some through back-room machinations and some through direct confrontations.<br /><br />Page Turner: 9/10.<br />This is unarguably where Martin's works stand out the most. I can't think of any other author I've read who switches points of view so frequently (Martin does it every chapter), and can keep my interest so consistently through the conclusion of one point of view and into the next. There's a really smooth flow from one setting to the next, such that you rarely feel like you're reading about unrelated events or stories. Martin manages to infuse back-room dealings with at least the intensity and pacing that you find in the battle scenes. And while his characters may not do a lot of growing (with the exception of some nice scenes between adolescent boys training for military service on the \\"Wall,\\" and an exiled princess who comes into her own as a queen) during the novel, their actions are frequently as unpredictable as any real-life character, happily without becoming unbelievable. You'll frequently find yourself uncertain whether a character will be alive or dead by the end of the chapter, and Martin does in fact kill off charismatic characters from time to time. There are those who are turned off by protagonists who are not always pure and good; but if you are engaged by morally grey scenarios in which people of all types struggle to abide by their own value systems, this novel will keep you on the edge of your seat. Here are a few comparison points: David Eddings writes very formulaic characters, both good and evil (although I admit that I still enjoy his novels, and I loved them as a kid). Robert Jordan hints at more Machiavellian characters, but there are still very clear lines drawn between characters on the \\"good\\" spectrum and those on the \\"bad\\" spectrum. Terry Goodkind is perhaps the greatest abuser of the perfectly good protagonist, the most brave, sacrificing, honest, and \\"pure\\" character. If you're ready for more realistic characters who struggle to do the right thing (and often don't), who believe in codes and creeds but don't always follow them, who make decisions that inadvertently harm themselves or their families, then Martin's story will do something for you that these other authors simply don't aspire to, or aren't capable of presenting.<br /><br />Kept Me Thinking: 5/10.<br />Some might argue that a real page turner is inevitably balanced by being less of a thinking book, or vice versa, but I think that's a cop-out. When I read anything by Cormac McCarthy, I find it almost impossible to tear myself away, and yet The Road (or All the Pretty Horses, or anything else he's written) is just brimming with material that'll keep your heart and intellect preoccupied long after putting the thing down. Martin's isn't terrible for a thinking person . . . but I think of it as engaging entertainment that you won't feel guilty about even if it's not being used as airport reading material.<br />___________________________________________________<br /><br />Overall Recommendation: 6/10.<br />This is a tricky one to recommend for the following reason: Martin uses sex (and violence, but violence bothers far fewer people) in his novels just the way you'd expect a studio to use sex in rated-R movies.I've read other reviews where people claim that he's merely describing a gritty world, but Martin's descriptions go beyond realism and into a kind of sleazy territory. It's not just that there is an actual or remembered rape in every chapter, including gang rapes and incest and rape involving children. Raping and pillaging is a historical fact, and I respect that those things deserve some acknowledgement. McCarthy's The Road, Toni Morrison's Beloved, and even Nabokov's Lolita treat difficult subjects involving violence and sexuality with thoughtful and complicated narratives. But Martin spends an inordinate amount of time describing genitalia, bodily fluids, and sex sounds, all to a kind of creepy extent. Perhaps even more troubling is the pervasive theme of rape and prostitution as a status quo in all walks of life, discussed by most characters with something approaching glee. I can respect that the status of women in the time period Martin seeks to describe was legitimately troubled; and yet Martin's descriptions seem to objectify women with little effort to complicate the debasement he describes. Now, if you're the kind of person who prefers HBO shows because of the extra skin and blood they flaunt, or if you aren't particularly sensitive to rape everywhere you look, you'll have no problems here. If you're a little less comfortable with the woman as sex object, you might want to think twice about this series, despite its other commendable qualities. At the least, these concerns are something every reader should think about, and to the extent that you indict or exonerate Martin on this topic, the overall recommendation for this book should drop or rise at least a point from what I've listed here.<br /><br />See my profile web page for an expanded review (as though this weren't already long enough!)arthy, I find it almost impossible to tear myself away, and yet The Road (or All the Pretty Horses, or anything else he's written) is just brimming with material that'll keep your heart and intellect preoccupied long after putting the thing down.

B0055S348W|4.0|This is pretty much a must-have if you use your Android device for anything beyond music/games and phone/GPS.  If you check email, it's awfully nice to print things up.  If you surf the web, it's good to be able to print receipts, coupons, etc.  If you use your Android device for anything work-related, printing up documents is almost a necessity.  And being able to print photos from the device i just took the picture with?  Priceless.<br /><br />That said, my Brother HL-3070CW wireless printer seems like it should be a good match.  My HTC Thunderbolt and Samsung Galaxy Tab wifi are on the wireless network, and so is my printer.  It's simply a matter of opening the app, finding your printer (which it did right away) and selecting the driver.  But there is no driver for the HL-3070CW.  I have tried a couple of the HL-2### series drivers which are included, and I'm able to print in black and white.  It's nice, but would be a lot nicer to ask the dev to include a driver for my printer.  So I spent ten minutes trying to find a website, forum, email...<br /><br />I have finally located the support link for this app.  It's just a forum thread at the bottom of the page under reviews, but I see the dev has replied on it, so I am hopeful.  Outside of one driver request because I want to print photos in color, this would be a five star app.  Maybe you don't want to pay the full price for the app, so you should wait for it to go on sale.  I got it as a FAOTD, and would gladly pay for this functionality if I had to.  Of all the apps I've downloaded, this is one of the most useful.

Ms. Day apparently thought that her pathetic prose and one-dimensional characters could rival 50 Shades of Grey -- they don't.  She didn't even have the originality to change the plot!  This book is about as hot as a polar ice-cap and as interesting as watching paint dry. I feel as if I had gone out to buy a Coach Bag and ended up with a second-hand plastic knock-off. Don't waste your money or your time on this one.

0345803485|5.0|This trilogy is addicting.  I read these books because of all thy hype.  I am married with 3 young kids and barely have time to read, but once I got started, I couldn't put the books down.  I made time to read. I stayed up late, woke up early, and made my husband cook and do the dishes all weekend. I read all 3 books in 5 days.  The books are naughty, so be prepared to blush 50 shades of red as you read.  Book 3 was my favorite, so don't give up!!  I'm not a book critic, just a mom who enjoyed the books.  I loved the characters and the ending!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|We love this game!  you can get out if it-just go to the Icon in the bottom right and hit options.  also you can set the parent controls to block purchases.  all you need is to switch it and it asks for your amazon password to continue the transaction.  no password no transaction.  once we figured this out we love the game!

B004QOB8SO|5.0|If you're tired of watching the same thing on television show after show, night after night, take a look at Sherlock. I would suggest starting with season one. You will be hooked, it's a smart funny retelling of the Sherlock Holmes classics. This is the new standard! Everything about this show from the writing, acting, music and sets are brilliant.<br /><br />I have but one negative thing to say concerning this series, there's not enough.
B00192IV9U|4.0|This was the first ever Michael Jackson album I've downloaded via mp3, rather than rush out to the store to purchase several copies on the first day of release (yes, I am a huge fan!). After Michael's passing that June, I really did not know what to expect... Before its release, I've heard many mixed views and did not really decide until I've heard it for myself.<br /><br />My favourite three songs off this album are 'Best of Joy', 'Another Day' and 'Behind the Mask'. They sound like they have been fully recorded by Michael, rather than the half-finished under-polished effect of the other songs on the album. I must say, Teddy Riley still did as fair a job as he could, given the circumstances.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.
0316077046|4.0|This book picks up after the aftermath of Lena's sixteenth birthday and the postponing of her Claiming. Feeling horrible guilt over what happened at her Claiming, Lena pulls away from Ethan. Believing that she belongs nowhere and is already Claimed, she follows her cousin Ridley and a beautiful Supernatural named John Breed. Together, they convince her to find the famed Great Barrier. Not willing to let her go, Ethan braves the Tunnels to try and bring her back. He is followed by his best friend Link and Keeper-in-training Liv.<br /><br />Honestly, I hated Lena throughout the entire book. I found myself just hoping that Ethan would end up with Liv. She was an amazing character, delightful, and well-rounded. I also really liked that the authors brought Link to the forefront of the novel. Since the first book, I enjoyed his character and wanted to know more about him. However, I was disappointed by Link's ending. It seems as though the authors are dead set against Link and Ridley being together.<br /><br />Aside from Lena, my biggest problem was with John Breed. I wanted to know more about him. Yes, they wanted him to be a mystery, but they risked a character with how vague they were. In addition, I also wasn't sure what I thought about the story involving Ethan's mother.<br /><br />The ending of this book was well done. Of course, the authors had the stereotype cliffhanger, but I still enjoyed it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I mean really!? Its bad enough that its the price of a physical book, without all the overhead, but now we can't even share it? Talk about greedy! I will not be reading this until someone comes off their high horse. There are way to many bad reveiws for me to blow $10 on something being described as porn.
B00753MBHA|5.0|Stalingrad is the thirteenth full-length studio album by the German Metal band Accept, and their second since reuniting and working with new frontman Mark Tornillo (of T.T. Quick fame) following up on the critically acclaimed comeback album Blood Of Nations from 2010.<br /><br />The quality of the songwriting is excellent and the band make a superb job of mixing ballsy up-tempo tracks of purely driving classic Heavy Metal and longer dynamic tracks that shift tempos and explore clean and acoustic territory as well.  There is enough variety so it isn't all just the same, but enough consistency that you're getting a pure and succinct experience.<br /><br />Like Blood Of Nations before it, Stalingrad takes the classic Accept sound and modernizes it slightly. Don't misunderstand, it isn't overly contrived to be youthful, but it is energetic and vital with any cheesiness removed. The record touches on a few metal styles, with hints of Thrash, Speed and Power Metal all creeping in in small doses alongside the classic Teutonic Metal style off the early Accept albums.<br /><br />Basically; imagine all the best elements of bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Megadeth, Overkill, and others condensed down into one album of tasteful guitar melodies and soaring leads, gang-backing-vocals and hard crunchy riffs. Mark's gravely low voice and occasional high notes come across as a brilliant mid-way point between Lemmy influenced singers and Halford influenced singers and suit the music remarkably well.<br /><br />The production, from Andy Sneap is also utterly perfect for the album and makes the music sound both powerful and clear, with crunchy feeling on the palm muted riffs and a clean sound on the leads. It isn't as dynamic as a 70s or 80s production job but it is a fantastic example of what a modern job can sound like when done right.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Accept and especially their new line-up then this is a must-have record; if you like traditional heavy metal then this is really worth exploring and finally if you like any other metal in general then you should consider giving this record a chance. Its solid, its meaty, it's the perfect mixture of very Hard Rock and straight-up Metal and I highly recommend it.y metal then this is really worth exploring and finally if you like any other metal in general then you should consider giving this record a chance.

0439023521|5.0|I had no idea what to expect from this book.  My friends read it and recommended it and online reviews were good, but I was still on the fence about it.  Then the movie came out and the hype won me over.  I must say ... I was pleasantly surprised!  I ended up devouring the book in two days and immediately started reading the second book.  I like the characters and I like the story.  Easy read and a page-turner for sure.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Honestly, as a 52 year old man I only read the first book because my 14 year old daughter and her friends are so excited about this series. I read the Hunger Games thinking I would try to force myself to read the book in a couple of weeks. I became totally immersed in the story and finished the book in a couple of days. I have read all three books and came away very impressed with the series. Catching Fire, as all the books, catches you totally off gaurd and keeps you wanting more of the story.<br />The author, Suzanne Collins has quite the imagination to come up with a story line like this. However, the more I read, the more I realized there are many similarities in the people of the Capitol and the citizenry of the U.S. (especially urban areas)and the people of Rome towards the end of the Roman Empire. The people of the Capitol are immersed in things of so little importance. They are totally caught up in appearance and frivolous things. They have no concern about how their government has total control of their lives. Sound familiar? Their thirst for violence is so like the ancient citizens of the Roman Empire that it could only be quenched by more violence with a different twist each time. Read up on what they used to do in the Coliseum and you will see what I mean. Here in the US, we are not there yet, but our citizens continue to become less involved in important issues of our day, more concerned about things like pop stars and whether our cell phones work fast enough, and we continue to crave more violent entertainment. Now if we could just get our young people make those comparisons, then maybe nothing like this will ever happen again.

B0072GPPNC|3.0|What in the world was Stephen Spielberg thinking ? The movie is painfully corny and predictable. The scenery is gorgeous and the photography excellent. But who would buy an Arabian for a plough horse ? The script is awful and the story totally derivative. When I was a child, in World War II, I had a book called \\"war dog.\\" It was about a boy's dog that was taken for the army. I wonder if it was the same story with the horse changed for the dog ? I am not ten years old anymore. The movie was disappointing.
0307956350|3.0|Overall I would say that I enjoyed the Expats. Would I recommend the book to a friend? Yes. Is the novel faultless? No.<br /><br />Chris Pavone writes in a style that is becoming more and more prevalent. Like a magician, he will show you a scene in the future and then build you up to that point. Once at the beginning of the book can be a good teaser, but every chapter it can get to be a bit much.<br /><br />To me one of the reasons that Pavone does this is to keep the story interesting.<br /><br />The protagonist is Kate Moore who for 15 years worked secretly for the CIA, even keeping this fact from her husband, Dexter. Dexter is a savvy computer guy who is not job savvy having missed out on some big opportunities that other people in his field took advantage of.<br /><br />As the story unfolds we find that Dexter gets a job offer to move to Luxemburg, which gives Kate a good reason to finally get out of the CIA and become a full time mommy. As Pavone shows the cards we find that Kate doesn't really enjoy being a full time mother and Dexter's new job is very secret. Enter Ben and Julia Maclean, the newest Expats to Luxemburg.<br /><br />It turns out that Kate has some serious suspicions that Ben and Julia may not be who they say they are. This is where I really begin to question this novel.<br /><br />For a former CIA field agent and later analyst, Kate has to have been one of the dumbest ones we had working. It seems odd that someone who dealt with secrets her whole life would be so open and trusting of someone she doesn't know that well and someone with whom she has serious questions. Kate later learns that Ben and Julia are FBI agents and what does she do? Of course she figures they are after her about an incident which happened years ago but is not revealed until the end of the book.<br /><br />Even when Kate is finally beat over the head with the fact they are not after her, what does she do? She tries to find out why, which leads to a series of unbelievable events. The problem I kept asking myself was why can't Kate talk to her husband? We keep getting the reason being because she hasn't told Dexter that she was in the CIA for 15 years. Meanwhile, Dexter keeps socializing with Ben and her with Julia.<br /><br />Of course if Kate had sat Dexter down and said, \\"Hey Dexter, I know that Ben and Julia are FBI agents and I think they are investigating you. If you don't want to go to jail, I would suggest that you cut off all contact with them\\" then we really wouldn't have a story. There is also another twist and turn about Julia and Dexter but again that could have been dealt with in the `we need to have a talk' conversation that Kate is almost never able to do.<br /><br />It may seem that I was down on the book and that is not accurate. I loved the twists and turns the book took, I just kept screaming at the characters to sit down and tell the truth and most of your problems wouldn't be problems.

B004UXUUDA|5.0|This is one of the first films which I can say I enjoyed MORE than I did the book. I appreciated the movie's greater focus on Sarah's story and voice, while I felt that the book focused more on Julia's experience. The movie's portrayal of the separation of children from their mothers in that French camp is a wrenching scene that will stay with you long after the film's end.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I once read in another review that the difference between a 4 & a 5 star review is not just really enjoying the book, but loving it so much that once you've finished reading it, you can't stop thinking about it. That's the case for me with Beautiful Disaster. I've read this book three times now and I miss the characters and their story once it's over. I consistently read about two to three books a week, but I always come back to this one. Sadly, I almost didn't buy this book because I thought the description sounded terrible, but thanks to the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Jamie did such a great job connecting you to the characters that you can't help but feel the roller coaster of emotions that the two main characters experience. What I love about this book is that it isn't the prototypical clean love story where there may be some kind of mild conflict at the beginning, but it always ends perfectly (e.g., he's rude to her when they first meet and she can't stand him, but they can't seem to stay away from eachother and they end up realizing that they love eachother and everything is right with the world, blah blah). Their relationship is messy. It's a whirlwind and at times it leaves them (and the reader) gasping for air, but you push on as they do because you love them so much (flaws and all....and they do have flaws) that you're hoping that this time things will be easier and that their love for one another will be enough.<br /><br />This is the first and only time I've been inspired to write a review so forgive the scatterbrained ramblings. Essentially what I want you to take away from this is that I LOVED this book and I truly believe you will too.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|A Christmas Carol and the Muppets; a match made in England. With this DVD, the movie is even greater than 50 years ago when the T.V. sets were not so great, but now, the picture quality is remarkable. If you haven't seen this yet, or you want the movie for your family, look for price and shipping, and buy. You won't be sorry. I have many versions of the \\"Carol\\", all of which are good, but this is the best one yet and it is close to the real story, which is amazing. When you finish watching the movie, put the Commentary on, (it will be in full screen) and listen to them as they explain what they were doing.  This is a must have for all of you Muppet lovers.  +JMJ+
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very easy to use and pick the version u want.  The only thing I would change is the ability to download the version NIV onto the Kindle and not just in the cloud.  Other than that this is an awesome app!

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I truly enjoyed this story with it's rich abundance of characters and plot twists. The main characters of Sophia and Charles were well crafted and ones that many people can relate to and cheer for. This is such an age old story, and there were a lot of the supernatural characters we've all come to know and love (or loathe), but the author has given us a fresh look at that unseen world of magic and mystery.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what happens next!

The picture and sound quality is average not that good as I expected to be but because it's an imported disk there might be some differences between a USA Region 1 And Region Free Blu Ray Disk. The overall performance of the Blu Ray is quite good and I don't have any disagreements about it but I'm quite satisfied about this new product.<br /><br />Thank You Very Much.<br /><br />Mr. David King Huang<br />SF, CA 94122.

B005HEUC5C|2.0|I really loved this show in the '80s and '90s. Now that I've seen Voyager and esp. DS9, I like this show.<br /><br />In spite of that, this was a stinker of an episode. The writers can (have done, and will) do better. The actors are all talented, but not given much to go on here.<br /><br />Why wasn't Troi called to the bridge when in contact with an alien species for the first time? Why would Riker just allow Geordi to go to their vessel with what seems like little thought? How important was this little sightseeing mission of theirs that Picard and Wesley would spend 6 hours in a shuttlecraft as opposed to the Enterprise getting them there in, what, minutes?<br />And how many specialties can one doctor have, for crying out loud? In \\"Unnatural Selection\\" Pulaski's lauded as the first mind in virology and immunology, and now we're supposed to believe she's a better choice than the docs who've done this procedure hundreds of times?? And they've never run into (or thought of considering the possibility of) \\"heterocyclic declination\\"? *facepalm*<br /><br />The only part of this episode I found bearable was the interchange between Picard and Wesley on the shuttlecraft. The whole \\"look to the past; nothing's better than history and philosophy\\" stuff was okay, but the personal talk of the captain's youthful indiscretions was better. Both actors carried it off with aplomb.<br /><br />The Pakleds were without dignity, interest, and apparently grammatical constructs like verb tenses thanks to the writers. I cannot imagine the Romulans handing over technology because they didn't want a single crewmember lost...they just don't seem that warmhearted to me.<br />One has to be able to go along for the ride in sci-fi type shows. I just wish the writers had given us more than a mule for transportation in this ep.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|This is mainly about one issue with this App. No Equalizer. It functions OK as long as I'm on WiFi or 4G, but it sounds terrible. I either use a stereo Bluetooth headset or my Turtle Beach corded set. Both sound great when connected to my PC where there are several ways of adjusting the sound, but sound terrible when used with this App alone. I picked up Equalizer from the Google Play Store and now I love my music again, but wait - I use my Kindle Fire alot. For those of you who don't know you can't get regular Android Apps on your Fire - only Amazon App Store Apps where there are a total of five if you do a search for \\"equalizer\\". So now I can listen to music on my phone or small HTC Tablet, but the Fire is out. Someone please upgrade this App or write a better one for the Amazon Market.
0385336950|4.0|Belk is an aging priest whose shaman friend Ronnie is dying.  He tries to keep Ronnie alive by telling him about the defining era of his life.  Belk was a teenaged bomb defuser in Alaska during WWII, in love with the same half-Eskimo prostitute, Lily, as his outrageously insane commanding officer Gurley.  The bombs in question were unmanned and being floated to North America from Japan by balloons.  The incendiaries could kill or maim anyone who came near them, but they hadn't been hugely destructive.  Then talk of germ warfare emerged, with the prospect of balloons carrying canisters of plague-infected fleas or rats.  Everything builds to a final voyage by Belk, Gurley, and Lily, ostensibly to locate Lily's former lover and Japanese spy, Saburo.  I was interested to know what was going to happen, but I didn't really care what happened. We know that Belk is going to survive the voyage, but Lily and Gurley are another matter.  Lily is conflicted about her feelings for Gurley, and I was conflicted about my feelings for Gurley.  He's out of control one minute, and then he's doing something admirable and courageous the next, but he's basically trying to redeem himself in the eyes of the military and of Lily.  His two audiences are somewhat at odds, rendering him somewhat conflicted as well.

I will be more careful next time.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|Enjoyed it immensely when it first came out.  Watching it now, because the suspense is not there since it's been seen before; makes it more nostalgic in a way than anything.  Kinda sad to watch knowing that Ms Whitney is no longer with us.  But makes you appreciate her first real acting effort all the more.  If the movie, A Star Is Born can be considered a classic for Barbara Streisand, then this should be considered in the same light for Whitney Houston; especially since it was her first effort.

Likewise, the ENGLISH BAROQUE SOLOISTS virtuoso musicians play MOZART'S COMPLETE 23 PIANO CONCERTOS with profound beauty, grace, enthusiasm, and love of AMADEUS'S most sophisticated keyboard masterpieces!  To ensure a sublime pianistic interpretation like AMADEUS intended for all his ORIGINAL 23 PIANO CONCERTOS NOS. 5 thru NO.27 [plus 2 PIANO RONDOS], internationally renowned FortePianist MALCOLM BILSON with world-class period instrument conductor JOHN ELIOT GARDINER used on their 9-CD SET the latest classical music research from MOZART'S AUTOGRAPH ORIGINAL MUSICAL SCORE MANUSCRIPTS.<br /><br />FortePianist MALCOLM BILSON captures the true essence of MOZART'S COMPLETE 23 PIANO CONCERTOS NOS. 5 thru NO.27 [plus 2 PIANO RONDOS] with a magnificent tour-de-force performance played on his new state-of-the-art 1978 PHILIP BELT USA FORTEPIANO that is an exact replica of MOZART'S ORIGINAL 1782 ANTON WALTER FORTEPIANO.  MALCOLM BILSON'S delivers a sublime MOZART PIANISTIC INTERPRETATION that unleashes his new state-of-the-art 1978 PHILIP BELT USA FORTEPIANO'S refined clear sweet radiant sounds that allows you to clearly hear with the greatest clarity all the ENGLISH BAROQUE SOLOISTS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA'S individual Period Instruments [percussion, strings, and woodwinds] and their classical music's notes! On this 9-CD SET, FortePianist MALCOLM BILSON'S intoxicating playing exhibits all the same artistic qualities that MOZART'S UNIQUE PIANISTIC STYLE was renowned - clarity, balance, delicacy, eloquence, sensitivity, simplicity, sublime finesse, and elegance - that allowed MOZART'S audiences to feel the piano music he was playing!<br /><br />Possessing a more softer ethereal tone, the 18th Century FORTEPIANO was the predecessor of today's MODERN PIANO. Unfortunately, today we play most of WOLFGANG MOZART'S unparalleled classical music on the MODERN PIANO which was not MOZART'S intention.  All of MOZART'S Piano Concertos and Chamber Music Piano Works were composed for the FORTEPIANO - not the MODERN PIANO. In 1972 when MALCOLM BILSON played for the first time MOZART'S ORIGINAL VIENNESE 1782 ANTON WALTER FORTEPIANO, BILSON was amazed and surprised to discover \\"For the first time in my life, I was able to play every single musical note written by MOZART for his PIANO CONCERTOS because the FORTEPIANO was superior to the MODERN PIANO for expressing MOZART'S PIANO CONCERTOS musical note's complete sonic qualities with timbres and textures.\\" MALCOLM BILSON further explained \\"when I played MOZART'S PIANO CONCERTOS on his ORIGINAL 1782 ANTON WALTER FORTEPIANO with the JOHN GARDINER conducting his ENGLISH BAROQUE SOLOISTS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA, my ears were filled with MOZART'S PIANO CONCERTOS amplified by a greater sound clarity and more vibrant music that allowed our audience to clearly hear all the CHAMBER ORCHESTRA'S individual Period Instruments [percussion, strings, and woodwinds] and their classical music's notes! Needles to say, since 1972 I will only play MOZART'S PIANO CONCERTOS on a NEW REPLICA FORTEPIANO or an ORIGINAL 18TH CENTURY FORTEPIANO with world's finest period instrument chamber orchestras!\\"<br /><br />It is important to remember that WOLFGANG MOZART composed his COMPLETE 23 PIANO CONCERTOS NOS. 5 thru NO.27 [plus 2 PIANO RONDOS K.382 & K.386] with the intention they BE PLAYED on an 18th CENTURY FORTEPIANO with ORCHESTRAL 18th CENTURY PERIOD INSTRUMENTS - NOT PLAYED on a MODERN PIANO with MODERN CLASSICAL MUSIC INSTRUMENTS.<br /><br />If you have experienced difficulty in enjoying listening classical music CDS performed on Fortepiano because you did not like the Fortepiano's tinny clanging sound compared to the Modern Piano's rich loud sound, not all FortePiano's have a tinny clanging sound - only Baroque FortePianos manufactured in Europe from 1710 to 1750 have a tinny clanging sound! MALCOLM BILSON'S new state-of-the-art 1977 PHILIP BELT FORTEPIANO has a lighter clear sweet radiant sound that reveals all MOZART'S  23 PIANO CONCERTOS classical music note's sonic qualities. In contrast, MOZART'S ORIGINAL 23 PIANO CONCERTOS played on Modern Piano and Modern classical instruments make it impossible to clearly hear all their classical music notes and orchestra's individual classical music instruments [percussion, strings, and woodwinds]! Compared to MODERN PIANO, the FORTEPIANO can WHISPER MORE SOFTLY than the HUMAN VOICE and SING AS SWEETLY as a VIOLIN.<br /><br />For those Classical Music Enthusiasts familiar with listening to MOZART PIANO CONCERTOS CDS performed on MODERN INSTRUMENTS, I promise you will have tears of joy in your eyes when you hear for the first time this GRAMOPHONE MAGAZINE 7 AWARD WINNING MOZART COMPLETE 23 PIANO CONCERTOS 9-CD SET performed like AMADEUS composed them to be played on HISTORIC PERIOD INSTRUMENTS by world-class FortePianist MALCOLM BILSON with maestro JOHN ELIOT GARDINER conducting his legendary ENGLISH BAROQUE SOLOISTS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA!TER FORTEPIANO.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an exciting book and had to read the 2 following books. I can see that this could actually happen in real life.  So close to the Roman times when they slew the Christians in the arena.  Katniss was \\"right on\\".  I felt that I was there living with her.  Such a good read.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|What can you say, the Beatles are great, the music is great, why not buy the entire collection? I recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0553103547|5.0|The order is great, I got the book really fast. Ordered it, the next day it was shipped and got it 10 days afterwards.<br />Not finished the book yet, but this far it's amazing. Looking forward to buy and read the next ones.<br />A must have book to all science-fiction readers.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I LOVE this app. I'm so addicted to it! My husband and I fight over it! What a great way to spend idle time!!
0345803485|5.0|Christian is Hot, Scary, Sensual and is afriad of losing the only woman who has ever touched him in a way he would never allow someone to.  Ana has touched his soul!  She has fallen in love him only after 3 weeks.  He has opened a new world to her.  Although it is a world she never expected, she has realized that it is a world she needs because Christian is in it. It's seductive, its enthralling and it makes you yearn for him!
B0056K4VRM|2.0|Another gentleman reviewing this set has called it a steal. The price, though undeniably enticing, is not the only thing about the set that screams CHEAP. The real steal, in some ways the only steal, is that of the consumer's cash, taken in return for third-rate transfers of well-produced stereo recordings from 1960 and thereabouts.<br /><br />Of the symphonies, the best-sounding of the present lot are the two recordings that always sounded the best: the Haffner and the Jupiter. Still, absence of surface noise aside, neither sounds better than the LP originals, which were singled out as remarkably good products at their initial release. What is more, neither these two symphonies nor 38, 39, and 40 sound as good as earlier Sony CD releases from the mid-eighties and early nineties. After having done numerous A-B comparisons of them all, I can report that in this new edition the latter three works sound like pressings made from a copy of the production master for the older [[ASIN:B0000027A8 Legendary Interpretations set]]. Tonal balance and relative instrumental prominence are the same, but all the newer discs have a slight to noticeable veil over the music, a veil not present earlier. It's a safe bet that the new pressings were not made from the original masters or first-generation copies.<br /><br />Worst for last: the remastering of the Linz Symphony is simply horrible. Imagine that someone made a cassette dubbing, on supercheap Type 1 tape, of his dad's scratchy old LP, already played a thousand times. Then he handed the cassette over to the chief of marketing at SonyUSA. He in turn gave it to the producer of this set and said, \\"Hey, Irv, use this thing to make the production master; the idiot buyers will never notice.\\"<br /><br />Of the other releases of this recording that I own--four in all: two LPs and two CDs--the two best are the remastered Japanese Sony LP from the late seventies and the very first domestic CBS CD (MK42027), which was produced from the Japanese LP master. Both are vastly superior to the Linz in this set, which I shall never listen to again. Anyone who thinks (1) that this stereo Linz recording is the best interpretation among Walter's three available recordings (counting the ubiquitous 1956 Paris aircheck), (2) that this is the Mozart symphony he did best of all, and (3) that no one has ever done the Linz as well as Walter--my own hand is up in all three cases--will be reduced to tears of frustration by the present issue.<br /><br />Incidentally, I have heard but never owned two releases of the stereo Linz that are measurably superior to all others. The first is the original open-reel tape corresponding to the stereo LP release of fifty years ago (DDD idolaters will bitterly complain about the very low but steady background tape hiss, of course). The second is [[ASIN:B000MAFYHC the current Japanese high-tech remastering]] (not SACD, alas), but just thinking about it leaves me feeling too strapped to buy lunch.<br /><br />It is sad that Sony's American and European branches now treat this conductor's legacy with such open contempt. When one compares the solicitude with which RCA, DG, and EMI have treated their archives of Toscanini (for the first-named company) and Furtw&auml;ngler recordings (for the latter two), Sony's attitude becomes truly scandalous.<br /><br />This conclusion is, if anything, exacerbated by the fact that the Japanese Sony remasterings and re-releases of the Walter material over the decades have been stupendously good, true state-of-the-art products. The problem for anyone on this side of the Pacific, of course, is that he needs to phone his financial adviser before daring to invest in any of them.<br /><br />The other recordings duplicated herein are happily not so badly handled, yet even so my A-B comparisons show that they utilize copies of earlier masters (some from the long-departed Bruno Walter Edition) rather than those masters themselves. Nothing stands as the equal of an earlier release, let alone an improvement on it. The Requiem is a case in point. The [[ASIN:B000002A86 BW edition]] had succeeded in finally, after forty years, letting some light shine through the aural murk and fog of Carnegie Hall, this recording's venue; the present CD, unfortunately, restores about half of the tenebrous gloom. Still, the interpretation is profound, the orchestra brilliant, and the singing of Irmgard Seefried and L&eacute;opold Simoneau seldom matched. The violin concerto recordings, with Zino Francescatti the perfect partner, are also not a disappointment; indeed, they are the least impaired of all the tapings reproduced in this set.<br /><br />Those unfamiliar with Bruno Walter's conducting may be wondering, \\"Why the fuss?\\" The answer: because aside from the G minor (K. 550), all the symphonies receive great performances, in a style that is inimitably individual yet formed in a tradition now, alas, dead as the dodo. Even the G minor is well worth an audition, but the way Walter hears this music seems oddly ablated from its plain-as-day dramatic implications. All four of his commercial recordings, recorded over a span of thirty-plus years, are similar, whatever their incidental differences of tempo (though even here, despite the impression of greater energy that their more animated tempi bring, none of the earlier performances are as attentive to important details of phrasing and color as the present one). Several airchecks of his frequent live performances are preferable, in that they seem truer to what is on the page. The [[ASIN:B00005B1EA Concertgebouw performance of June 19, 1952]], available on Music & Arts and other labels, is one of a number that show that Walter could call forth this music's dramatic potential without scanting its myriad subtleties.<br /><br />To conclude, listeners who already own CDs containing earlier transfers of the works included here should know that tearing up dollar bills and tossing them to the winds would be more advisable than doing what I did: spend never-to-be-recovered cash on this disappointing reissue. It is certainly recommendable to those who have no other purchasing option, but one does no service to newcomers to Walter's recordings to insist, contrary to all the evidence, that they are getting what they have every right to expect for their money: the best transfers available.<br />_____________<br /><br />Update (March 9, 2015): Late last year, I finally became the owner of a copy of [[ASIN:B000MAFYHC the Japanese high-tech remastering]] of the Linz Symphony (plus no. 39) mentioned above. I was lucky enough to get it used from a Marketplace reseller who, remarkably, was asking less than twenty dollars. It frequently runs to what one might pay for a bottle of vintage claret.<br /><br />All that is worth saying about this disc is that it exhausts superlatives. Since it existed before the present box of CDs was produced, the question that remains is why couldn't Sony have used this issue, along with other current Japanese releases of Walter's Mozart recordings, as the basis for the set under review?is a case in point.

1250008409|5.0|Andy Puddicombe, a former Buddhist monk, is recognized as the UK's foremost mindfulness meditation expert. He shares powerful excises, stories and techniques to help calm the chatter in the mind in \\"Get Some Headspace: How Mindfulness Can Change Your Life in Ten Minutes a Day.\\"<br />He says meditation isn't about becoming a different person. It's about training in awareness, understanding how and why we think and feel the way we do and getting a healthy sense of perspective in the process.<br />He was drawn to meditation or \\"headspace\\" in his early 20s because he felt his mind was permanently switched on, going round and round like a washing machine. In addition to his 'busy head' he felt as though he was always drifting into unnecessary worry, frustration and sadness.<br />He says he prefers the word 'headspace' because it describes the underlying sense of peace and contentment no matter what emotion might be at play. He says mindfulness is the ability to be present, meditation is the best way to learn the skill and 'headspace' is the outcome.<br />The theme of \\"Get Some Headspace\\" is awareness and an understanding of ourselves and others. It's about developing a gentle curiosity: watching, noticing and observing what's happening in every aspect of our life. It's about finding a sense of ease with ourselves right now, choosing how we see life and how we communicate and relate with others, cultivating kindness, compassion and appreciation towards ourselves and others and developing greater dedication, balance, equanimity, acceptance, presence and composure.<br />Andy says there are three components of mindfulness training: understanding how to \\"approach\\" the technique, how to behave while \\"practicing\\" the technique and how to \\"integrate\\" that quality of mind into everyday life.<br />I found Andy's metaphors for the mind helpful. He says the underlying essence of our mind is like a clear blue sky. When the mind is busy with thoughts and feelings the sky is temporarily obscured by the \\"clouds.\\" He says the blue sky is the headspace. It's always there. Meditation is not about keeping all the clouds at bay. It's more about setting up a deck chair and watching the clouds roll by. It's resting the mind. It's not trying, not doing, just being.<br />A second helpful image is the mind being like a wild stallion. We need to take it slowly, be gentle and give the horse all the space it needs until it comes to a natural space of rest. If the horse struggles, just loosen the rope again slightly and gently repeat the process.<br />A third image is a very still clear pool of water. If we throw a pebble in the water it creates a ripple on the surface and it takes awhile for the water to settle. The pool reflects the surface of our minds. If we throw many pebbles in the water it stirs up the bottom and it's impossible to see anything at all. There's no clarity.<br />If we experience physical discomfort during meditation another helpful exercise is to imagine it's the discomfort of a person we care about. It's an act of extraordinary generosity to sit with their discomfort so they don't have to.<br />Andy says meditating just ten minutes a day increases productivity, clarity and focus, reduces stress and anxiety, and helps with weight loss, improves sleep and personal relationships.<br />\\"Get Some Headspace\\" (building mind-fitness) also brings us the extraordinary science behind mindfulness meditation.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|the cover is sturdy, and the tri-fold bit works fine if you want to set the kindle up horizontally on a table. the elastic band is sort of awkward, but you really don't even need it most of the time anyway.

0307477479|2.0|I kept waiting for all of these little stories to \\"get to the point\\" and congeal into a plot.  Never happens.  Oh!  Pulitzer Prize!  So what?  The characters are self-absorbed, hard to care for and seem to go out of their way to hurt others.  (Everyone seems to have a very rich inner life, though - we get to read every freakin' thing they are thinking.)  The back and forth through time and location was just frustrating...and if I'd known there was a PowerPoint presentation in the middle of it, I would have dismissed it out of hand.  PowerPoint is not creative.  Crappy texting is not groundbreaking.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Fast paced read that held my interest.  The Bosch and Haller connection gives Harry a new dimension.  Connelly is able to maintain his writing integrity in both the Bosch and Haller serials, i.e., he does not take short cuts and get too simple.  I am reading the 5th Witness now.

0937381888|5.0|I've only been brewing for a bout 1.5 years but this was the first brewing book I purchased and really the only one I've needed.  This book has tons of information and it seems like every time I come back to it to review a section I learn something new.  For beginners, I would recommend to jump right in.  If the terminology or processes don't make sense to you at first then it will certainly resonate after completing your first brew session.  This book is definitely the brewing bible and will help you become a better brewer no matter how long you've been brewing.<br /><br />CAUTION:  Homebrewing is an addictive hobby and can certainly act as a blackhole that you'll be throwing your money into.  With that said, you'll enjoy every second of it and will ultimately be rewarded with the greatest reward of all, beer!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|The movie was crystal clear, I've watched movie many times, but watching this Blu-ray edition, I saw things I've never spotted, it was like Easter egg hunting. I've been watching this movie in English all the time, I forgot that I can watch this in Japanese. Turned off subtitles, relaxed and watched in Japanese, it was excellent.
0345803485|3.0|This book was not written as well as some books I've read, however, it did put a more positive light on BDSM. There are some reviews on here that describe the book  as having a plot of abuse. BDSM has moral ethics that go along with it. One being SSC --Safe, Sane, and consensual. There are Masochists out there. What the author fails to point out is that when someone is inflicting pain on their consenting partner, the masochist is getting a flood of endorphines, making the pain turn to pleasure. This is why Ana feels so good after her spankings. It's the same as taking a mile run. You feel good afterwards, right ? That's the endorphines. Ana becomes overemotional after her Initial spanking when her endorphine high wears off. That being said, the author makes a point to assure everyone Ana is doing this consentually.  Keep in mind that this is only the author's fantasy. In real BDSM relationships, the women are a lot more open minded and actually search out sadists and dominants to partner with. A kinky guy hooks up with a vanilla girl? Hardly ever happens. There are places to find other kinky people.  I personally have never sought out a vanilla guy and asked him to be kinky with me. I also seek out kinky men because I'm kinky. You wouldn't seek out a lesbian as a straight woman, would you? So why would you seek out a vanilla person if you are kinky? It's a fantasy. Oh...and just an FYI:  sadism and masochism have been taken out of the DSM...making them NOT psychological disorders. Liked the book as it could potentially educate vanilla people on BDSM not being as horrible as media portrays it. Good plot. Immature novice erotica in the context of BDSM though. I would recommend it. :)
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book. I don't often write reviews about books I read, but even months after finishing this book I am still thinking about it. I have recommended it to many people, including my mother who also loved it. You won't be disappointed.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just as good as the first! It continues the story, but the turn of events throw you through a loop! Definitely worth the buy, and vthe price was fair for an e-book! I even bought the last book on Amazon too :)
0307592731|5.0|This is a beautiful, honest book.<br />Similar to \\"Eat, Love Pray\\" but without the annoying<br />navel gazing author Elizabeth Gilbert.<br />This is so much better.  I loved every page.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ive been waiting for kindle fire to get this and its great (: you should totally download its a great game!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Nothing more than a pornagraphic harlequin novel.  Read all three hoping to be surpirsed by something significant.  A big disappointment.  An award should be given for outstanding marketing!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to read this one - the cover doesn't speak to me. BUT, boy, am I glad I did! The Giver gave far more than I could ever have expected. The characters were so real, I could reach out and touch them. And the world is hauntingly terrifying in its sameness. That is exactly what would happen to us if we gave up our free agency to choose - even though agency is a double-edged sword that can inflict so much pain on us. I really like the concept of The Giver as a custodian of memory. This book is a brilliant read - sadly a bit short, I could have done with a few more chapters - for anyone wanting to explore how the world would be without choice. I loved it.
B005HSL626|5.0|Good fun for all ages. My husband and I both downloaded this for our Kindle Fires and enjoy playing it. Challenging enough for us, but simple enough for our 2 kids, age 5 and 7 to also enjoy playing
B005USZML4|4.0|Another good John Grisham book.  It's nice to see a decent mystery book that teens can read.  Not as much courtroom or lawyer action as many of the Grisham books but I enjoyed it.
B002VKE0XA|3.0|A guy moves his girlfriend into his house, some scary things start to happen, he decides he has to film it, they find out their house is haunted by a demon and that the demon wants the girl,then all Hell breaks loose. Girl goes missing while the Guy is found dead along with his tape. The End.<br /><br />  That's the story in a nutshell folks. And of course Paramount is trying to pass it off as a true story because it drives up ticket sells. But what we're really left with is just another haunted house story that doesn't break any real ground. All the cliches are here: doors opening and closing on their own, stuff flying off furnitures and walls, the girl levitates, stomping footsteps and heavy breathing coming out of no where. While a lot of people have found this to be scary, I found it pretty boring and tedious. Several times I found myself staring up at the clock and wondering how much longer until we see the inevitable ending where the camera hits the ground and the post script comes up. Not the kind of reaction you'd expect from a movie touted as being \\"one of the scariest movies ever made\\". Sorry but I beg to differ. The cast of two are likable enough and they do come across as being real people as opposed to two dimensional caricatures you find in all haunted house movies. But even they can't help with a lackluster script and poorly timed scares.<br /><br />  With the popularity of many ghost shows like Ghost Adventures, Ghost Hunters, and Paranormal State on the rise, its no wonder that Paramount proceeded with this movie. Trouble is, its all been done before and better. If you want scary, I'd suggest you find an episode of A Haunting over this one.

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Can I give it 10 stars? What a very powerful read and I mean that in a very positive and spectacular way! I fell in love with the characters, Gideon, Eva and Cary, and I was intrigued by some of the others. It was very well written. I loved it so much that I am having a very hard time putting my review into words lol. This was a great story that kept me hooked throughout. I was happy with the ending, but still wanting to learn so much more about Gideon, which I know I will learn in book 2, Deeper in You, that comes out in October...sighing....only because I have to wait that long lol. Sylvia Day is another author to be added to my favorites. I highly recommend this book! I just can't give it enough praise I am now at a loss for words. Thank you Sylvia for writing a wonderful story and I look forward to your others:) Sincerely, a very happy reader!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Very interesting book- not sure what to think about what the author experienced. The book challenges what we have been taught to expect after death- very thought-provoking.
0439023521|5.0|This book as a really dynamic read. Such an awful, yet captivating story. I highly recommend it. It didn't feel like a \\"young adult\\" read to me because of the brutality in it, so don't let that scare you off. Definitely a fascinating read.
B007HU4FZ2|1.0|Two hours of a man being brutally tortured, and all to serve the agenda of a director who's gone off the rails. And this dreck made a ton of money at the theatres?
1594203334|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this book.  As a foreign-born parent living in the U.S., I am constantly surprised by the rising amount of overachieving, overzealous, and stressed out parents.  This book offers an alternative parenting approach, a polar opposite to Tiger Mom parenting.  Don't pressure your child, don't stress if your child doesn't measure up to his peers.  Every child is unique.  \\"Relax, don't do it\\" and may I also add \\"breathe\\" when raising child.
0786715103|5.0|A haunting, powerfully written book by the commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in Rwanda during the genocide. It's difficult to read, because you'll come away from the book angry and disgusted frequently. The disregard of most of the world to what was going on in Africa at the time, the horrors of the genocide, the brutality of what happened... all of these things will horrify you. Dallaire paid a steep price, placed into an impossible position and unable to act. He went to Rwanda a proud soldier and came back a broken man, shattered by what he had witnessed. The book serves as a damning indictment of much of the world for its thoughtlessness, and as a reminder of just how cruel human beings can be.

Please don't break the routine and give it your all for those 20 minutes! I just ordered power 90 and I am exciting to keep seeing my body change! From size 18 to a 13 thats 5 sizes down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this I truly do!
B007UXSPK2|1.0|This is just another big-budget movie with not much real creative thought.  The story is preposterous, the characters completely hollow and it just leaves you wondering what happened?<br /><br />It's like ordering a birthday cake made of sponge rubber and covered in frosting.<br /><br />It seems that Hollywood can rake in the cash without having to actually build a storyline that hangs together - even a little bit.<br /><br />2 hours wasted.
B007NYODBS|2.0|The premise of this movie is good: one eleven year old boy whacks another with a stick during an argument and the parents discuss it to try and enlighten the boys about what's right (at least that's what one mom wants). Despite an impressive cast, however, the conversation and movie is unrealistic and stagey. The characters seem implausible and one inconsistent. Like always, Kate Winslet is awfully nice to look at and there is something there, so not a total loss, but definitely not a recommendation.
0439023521|1.0|I don't understand all the hype about this book.  It's NOT a good book, and it's barely material for a short story.<br /><br />It's badly written with a minimalist plot and characters.  The core concepts in the book are very poorly developed.<br /><br />Why all the hype?
B007N8RULO|4.0|great! With 1suit I can win nearly every game. 2 suits makes it next to impossible. just pick your level.
B00164KYV4|3.0|Last night's bargain rack movie was the \\"He's Just Not Into You\\" DVD. I guess it was supposed to be a romantic comedy, but if it was there weren't many laughs. The movie was set up such that it supposedly offered advice to single women regarding single men. Personally, I thought the movie was insulting to single people, in general, and especially to single women. I can say this because I was a single person for over 50 years beyond puberty until I finally got married. Believe me, I know what the single life is like. I actually felt sorry for the very attractive single women depicted in this movie and I felt embarrassment at the depiction of the men. A comedy? Maybe a laugh track was needed so that the audience could tell when it was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />The production values of the film were fairly high. The photography was good. The sound track was okay. The acting of most of the characters was actually fairly good to excellent in a lot of places. Unfortunately, the cast was burdened with a pathetic story line. Almost every cliche of single life was dwelled upon at length. The movie was boring and embarrassing at the same time. I longed for the end. This DVD will go into the trash. I couldn't bear watching it again and I would never lend it to a friend for viewing.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
0439023521|4.0|A dystopian world where children are forced in competitions to fight to the death as a reminder of the power of the government.<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of first person present tense writing, however the strength of the story distracted me enough to make this really good reading for me. It was one of those books which reads very quick because I don't want to put it down. I was surprised to see how well the characters were fleshed out using memories and tales, and Suzanne Collins made her main character, Katniss Everdeen believable as a stone killer, even though she is just a teen girl. Well done.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Easy to get in to. If you are an avid reader of mysteries you will probably figure this out less than halfway through the book. It took me a little longer. Still was an enjoyable quick read - hard to actually put down once started. Glad I read it.
B0074EIQQU|4.0|When Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala began touting their last album, Octahedron, as their &quot;acoustic&quot; album, certain expectations were created in this listener's mind.  When that album was released, those expectations were left almost completely unsatisfied.  Fortunately, my very expectations for Octahedron were realized, almost to a T, in Noctourniquet.  Funny, as the music was apparently recorded around the same time.<br /><br />Having stated the motivation behind Octahedron to be a need for a change in dynamic, what was unveiled instead was more or less usual Mars Volta fare stripped of dynamics.  Stiff, flat compositions performed with seemingly minimal enthusiasm.  It had its moments, but it was altogether disappointing.  Moreover, Bixler-Zavala's work in both the lyrical and melodic departments seemed to be extremely lacking, and at times even dispassionate. I felt more than a little vindicated in these impressions when Mr. Zavala revealed in a recent interview that he is not too fond of the album himself.  In fact, Cedric has opened up about quite a few things in the inner world of The Mars Volta that have served to put a lot of these developments (or lack thereof) in perspective.  For instance, he attributes the aforementioned decline in quality to an oppressive work pace set by his partner-in-crime and erstwhile-musical-dictator, Mr. Lopez.<br /><br />Which brings us to Noctourniquet.  Having &quot;put Omar in his place&quot;, so to speak, Cedric took the better part of 2 years crafting the vocal landscape of the album.  And the payoff is great.  This is by far, in all respects, the band's most consistent and rewarding release since &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;.  The cartoonish excesses of Amputechture and Bedlam have been eliminated, and the lumbering apathy of Octahedron is nowhere to be found.  What we are given is a collection of songs that feel just familiar enough to make longtime fans comfortable while exploring plenty of new territory (Omar writing in major keys?), ranging from the funky electro-pop of &quot;Lapochka&quot;, complete with a wordless, epic shout-along chorus (not to mention some mind bending drum breaks from new drummer Deantoni Parks) to the distorted industrial soundscaping of &quot;In Absentia&quot;, which wouldn't sound out of place alongside &quot;Last Rights&quot;-&quot;Process&quot; era Skinny Puppy.<br /><br />Some of the album's greatest moments, however, are its lighter ones.  &quot;Empty Vessels Make the Loudest Sounds&quot; creeps quietly back and forth like a bipolar ballad between melancholy, brooding passages and bright, major-key, synth-tinged exclamations as Zavala croons, &quot;Must be on my way, I gotta get home..&quot;, perhaps some of the most human words ever spoken in the context of a Mars Volta song, before finally crashing into a heavy and ominous crescendo of &quot;mountains of cavernous people, searching for a lighthouse in the fog.&quot;  This is one of the most beautiful (never thought I'd be using that word to describe a Volta song) pieces of music this band has ever produced, despite also being one of the most minimalistic.<br /><br />The somber, reflective mood established by &quot;Vessels&quot; is quickly dissipated by the metallic squeal that gives birth to the drunken stagger of &quot;The Malkin Jewel&quot;'s psychedelic carnival dub, held in very loose form by the free-rolling drum work of Parks.  Bixler's voice descends to a deep, raspy whisper before rising to a vicious snarl.  This track is odd, even for The Mars Volta, in a very good way.<br /><br />On the other hand, tracks like &quot;Aegis&quot; and &quot;Dyslexicon&quot; provide familiar footing.  After stomping through a militant 4 to the floor march, &quot;Aegis&quot; erupts into a chorus that is strikingly reminiscent of &quot;Inertiatic ESP&quot;.  &quot;Dyslexicon&quot;, meanwhile, spends the first half of its life in an intense post-hardcore grind before winding its way intoa double time jam with that welcome touch of Latin groove.<br /><br />The title track stands alongside &quot;L'Via&quot; and &quot;Meccamputechture&quot; as one of the funkier pieces in Volta's repertoire, and also sports some rather sensual outbursts from Zavala that would make James Brown proud, while &quot;Molochwalker&quot; adds to the ranks of their illustrious aggro-prog catalogue, in the company of &quot;Cygnus.. Vismund Cygnus&quot; and &quot;A Plague Upon Your Hissing&quot;, albeit much tamer than its siblings.  The acoustic explorations of &quot;Trinkets Pale of Moon&quot; and &quot;Vedamalady&quot; offer a brief respite between the two and continue Omar's journey into the softer side of Volta.  Along with &quot;Vedamalady&quot;, &quot;Imago&quot; may be the high water mark of all the acoustic pieces, as they each make ample use of those all-too-alien major key sounds that bring a long overdue shred of light and unabashed prettiness to Volta's typically sinister tonal pallette, focused as it usually is upon tritonal dissonance.<br /><br />Apparently remembering how important first and last impressions can be, the band also does a great job of opening and closing the album on grandiose notes.  Coming out of the gate with &quot;The Whip Hand&quot;, the industrial vibe that will resurface throughout the album is quickly established through the heavy synth work and driving mechanical beat--a simple yet carefully spliced, self-inverting pattern that gives some spice to its 4/4 time.  As the song abruptly transitions into a loud assault of growling, menacing, Reznor-esque synth-lines and crashing cymbals, Bixler wails, on the fringes of tonality, &quot;That's when I disconnect from you.&quot;  This song also boasts what will undoubtedly become THE sing-along line of their live shows, as the band drops out to let Cedric, accompanied only by Parks' infectious beat, proclaim: &quot;I am a landmine, I am a landmine, so don't ya step on me, so don't ya step on me.&quot;<br /><br />Meanwhile, &quot;Zed and Two Naughts&quot; (a nod to experimental filmmaker Peter Greenaway) is, quite simply, the most epic ending of a Volta album since &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot; (I exclude &quot;Cassandra Gemmini&quot; simply because its 30 minute run time can render it anticlimactic after a while).  The verses sound like a drum'n'bass remix of earlier Volta, while the chorus bears some resemblance to that of &quot;Cassandra Gemmini&quot;.  A perfect blend of the new and the old, and a perfect way to end the album.<br /><br />Overall, Noctourniquet presents the more streamlined Volta that Omar seems to have been envisioning for the past few years without sacrificing any substance.  The slower, acoustic-based ballads are in ample supply, the incessant aural assault has been stifled, new vistas have been explored and claimed, and, most satisfyingly, Cedric presents some of the best vocal melodies of his career, as well as some carefully crafted lyrics that manage to both avoid the recycling and forced verbosity of his recent work, as well as exploring a simpler, more direct side to songwriting.  It also helps to put its awkward predecessor, Octahedron, in perspective.  Instead of working to outdo themselves as they seemed to be for the first several years of their career, these past two releases appear to be somewhat of a weight-loss program for a band growing morbidly obese with musical gluttony.  Where Octahedron was a very unpleasant, painful fast, designed to shed as many pounds of sonic overkill as quickly as possible, Noctourniquet marks a return to a balanced diet that avoids all the excess carbs and sugars.<br /><br />I suppose my one complaint is with the track &quot;Trinkets Pale of Moon.&quot;  Though it's a great song, Cedric's nasally falsetto on the chorus makes me cringe just a little.  But, that's a small complaint for such a great album!  Fans with an eclectic taste should find plenty to sink their teeth into here.have been much more disheartening if they had fizzled out with Octrahedron.  Here's to 12 years of (mostly) great music!  Goodbye, Mars Volta; it was a heck of a ride.
0439023513|1.0|Spoilers here!<br /><br />I wanted this book out of my house the moment I finished reading it, just a stench to Collins handiwork, as if the book itself were one of Snow's roses. I felt cheated by the author. Other reviewers aptly describe how tortured the writing was, how illogical the characters, and unsatisfactory, the storyline.  Thus let me focus specifically on the epilogue:<br /><br />I was so puzzled, annoyed, over the lack of generosity exhibited by Collins, her unwillingness perhaps to re-think her third book, that it became a fixation to re-read the last few chapters to make some sense of the author's choices. I felt on one level I needed to respect the author's imagined final scenes, because, after all, this was her project, brainstorm, pride and joy. Yet somehow, as reviewers often suggested, giving myself permission to interpret the ending she provided, did alleviate the negative emotions, and helped me retain my view of Gale as noble. The epilogue, I concluded, was intentionally bizarre, in that the author had given Katniss a Twilight Zone finish:<br /><br />At first read, it seemed the author had given Katniss a best-case almost-happy ending. Far from it.<br />Katniss is now in more danger than she had ever been, literally at the hands of Peeta. Peeta has to grip a chair at times, holding tight to it, as he tries to squelch the almost overwhelming feeling to strangle<br />Katniss. He can never fully conquer this condition, this impulse.<br /><br />Katniss is a star-crossed lover, who out of guilt denies herself the love of her life, Gale, and who is still<br />so scarred, drug-dazed, that real and unreal are nonsense terms to her. When she replies to Peeta's query if her love for him is real and unreal, she answers \\"real,\\" and she might just as well have said, \\"Whatever.\\" Just pacifying Peeta and rationalizing to herself.<br /><br />The epilogue highlights a feminist message that pervades the entire series that doesn't seem to serve Katniss well anymore. Katniss performs the traditional role of the male, as hunter; Peeta, the classic feminine role, baker/cook. Peeta is not taller than Katniss (and in the film version even shorter) as if he were the old-fashioned \\"little woman\\" of the household. Peeta may be the bread-baker, but Katniss is the bread winner, no rest for her, and there is a weariness in her tone as she speaks of her current family life. Katniss might want to sing to herself something like \\"I am woman,\\" but she has no fight in her to roar. Gone is the possiblity for the life she could have had with Gale, and she knows it, where two hunters worked together, in more of a balanced approach to food-gathering activity (one could rest, enjoy the view, while the other worked at times).<br /><br />Peeta has been patient and waited more than a decade for Katniss to bear children. Yet the result does not<br />signify a warm, loving family. Katniss calls her flesh and blood \\"the girl\\" and \\"the boy,\\" clinically itemizing their physical features, thus displaying a disturbing desensitization to her children. Post-traumatic stress syndrome will never leave her, it seems. Katniss mentions she takes her children to the meadow, which is basically a mass graveyard. She is not clear whether she is speaking of the Hunger Games period, or of an ongoing intra-state conflict, where peace does not seem possible. What is obvious is that the meadow is not a place of innocence or even safety, and she dreads the day she must enlighten these children about its more serious implications.<br /><br />So the ending of the book gives us a wounded non-healer, non-heroine. I agree with other readers who had hoped for a brighter ending. My hope is that someday an enlightened writer of fiction centering on post-apocalyptic themes, will imbibe the spirit of my mentor, St. Francis of Assisi, and show us that a scarred human being could radiate a Franciscan spirit in a frantic world, demonstrating a newfound, undiminished joy Such an ending might not suit everyone's taste, but I like to be uplifted by the works I absorb.
0345803485|5.0|First I'd like to start off saying that I am by NO means an avid reader and I read all 3 of the 50 shades books in about 4 days- I just couldn't put them down!  After flying through the Hunger Games series I figured I'd try to find something else to hold my attention for awhile since I have NEVER found reading appealing.  I saw lots of mixed reviews on this book but after reading the first couple of chapters through Amazon I figured I'd give it a go, I'm REALLY glad I did.  I seriously couldn't put the book down- I've never read anything erotic and while this book definitely gives your s*x life a boost, there's nothing too raunchy to put off those of you who might be scared off by it.  I think I loved this book most because it is the epitomy of that \\"bad boy\\" persona- the guy who you hate, then love, then hate again, I couldn't get enough of it.  For those of you going back and forth on whether to read this series, JUST DO IT ALREADY, you won't regret it ;)

The quality of it is really good but the disc skips during some moments in the 3 disc and then random subtitles show up on top of the screen.  I was under the impression that the DVDs were authentic and not a rip off.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical about Hunger Games, but because my grand daughter loved it I had to read it. I was not sorry. The story, plot and the premise are fascinating. Suzanne Collins has put together a plot line with great imagination and creativity. Once I began reading, I could not stop, and I rarely finish a book in a single sitting as I did with Hunger Games. The book moved me to the movie, also not sorry, the film stayed true to the book. Since then I have moved on the the next two volumes of the complete story.<br /> [[ASIN:B007S0LT5U Jun-e-or]]

0345803493|4.0|After surviving 50 Shades of Grey, and after taking a break for a few days from Ana and Christian's tortured romance, I girded my loins and cracked open the second book of the trilogy, 50 Shades Darker.<br /><br />For those of you intrigued by the words \\"butt plug\\" or \\"fisting,\\" half of you will enjoy your lucky day, because one of those is kinda sorta featured in this book. As it is, the only fisting we ever see - ever come close to seeing - is that of Ana's or Christian's hands in the others' hair. And that happens a lot. Not as often as Ana or Christian gasping, or Christian setting his lips in a hard line, or Ana biting her lip, or Ana coming undone, or Christian frowning. In fact, Christian's frowning is such a \\"thing\\" that, when Ana frowns, another character observes that she's turning into Christian.<br /><br />It's just ... WHERE THE HELL WAS THE EDITOR?<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />To dig too deeply into the spectacle that is 50 Shades of Grey is to approach Sisyphean frustration. Trust me, because I know of what I speak. I spent an inordinate amount of time wondering how it was that Christian Grey was 27 and a billionaire as I read the first book. I don't think we are meant to really ponder this stuff. I think we're supposed to strap on our dildos and have at it, as it were.<br /><br />Okay, so. When we last left Christian and Ana, she had walked out on him, horrified at the depravity entailed in his life of BDSM. (Go ahead and Google THAT, people. I had to, so you might as well.) As with its muse, Twilight, we see our heroine descend into despair, but unlike Bella's months on end, Ana really only suffers for five days. Christian gets in touch with her, and it's game on, kids. Christian is prepared to let go of his need for dominance in his playroom, because all he really wants - all he really needs - is Ana. She has admitted that she loves him, but it takes Christian a little longer.<br /><br />Now, before you start thinking that this is the end of the Red Room of Pain, let me tell you that it is not. Don't worry - Christian keeps the room, and Ana remains inexplicably drawn to it. So those butt plugs come in handy (no pun intended), although - SPOILER - Christian does point out that for the anally virgin, a finger is a better start. So Ana has something to look forward to, so to speak.<br /><br />Back to the plot, such as it is. It turns out that one of Christian's former subs remains fixated on him, so she enters the story to muck up Christian and Ana's relationship. Also causing trouble is Ana's boss  at the publishing house. He wants her, which pisses off Christian, who reacts as only Christian can. Meanwhile, Christian and Ana's romance progresses in fits and starts. She loves him, he really cares about her, can he say the \\"L\\" word, can they get past his need for control, why does he love her, why does she love him, can he overcome his tortured childhood, blah blah blah.<br /><br />What you really want to know about are the sex scenes, right? RIGHT? I'm pretty sure you butt plug searching people aren't concerned about the dialogue.<br /><br />In this book, they rock the headboard in an elevator, on a boat, in Christian's childhood room, in the shower (again - evidently they enjoy that spot), Ana's apartment bedroom, Christian's apartment bedroom, and - YESS! - the Red Room of Pain. Oh, and on top of a piano and a pool table. There may be more. Did the desk happen in this book, or the previous one? I think they wind up on Christian's desk in this one, too.<br /><br />During one of the many times Ana challenges Christian, they are in the library, competing in a billiards game.<br /><br />\\"You know, Anastasia, I could stand here and watch you leaning and stretching across this billiard table all day,\\" he says appreciatively.<br /><br />I flush. [SHE FLUSHES A LOT. That's another thing that is repetitive, and so again, I ask, WHERE THE HELL IS THE EDITOR? Oh - those are \\"shouty caps,\\" according to Ana. Backto the program.] Thank heavens I am wearing my jeans. He smirks. [HE SMIRKS A LOT. So does she. Sometimes they smirk, bite lips and eye roll, all at the same time.] He's trying to put me off my game, the bastard. He pulls his cream sweater over his head, tosses it onto the back of a chair, and grins at me, as he saunters over to take his first shot.<br /><br />He bends low over the table. My mouth goes dry. Oh, I see what he means. Christian in tight jeans and white T-shirt, bending, like that ... is something to behold. I quite lose my train of thought. He sinks four solids rapidly, then fouls by sinking the white.<br /><br />Foreplay, Christian styles.<br /><br />And now, for the butt plug seekers:<br /><br />\\"What's this?\\" I hold up the silver bullet thing.<br /><br />\\"Always hungry for information, Miss Steele. That's a butt plug,\\" he says gently.<br /><br />\\"Oh ...\\"<br /><br />\\"Bought for you.\\"<br /><br />What? For me?<br /><br />He nods slowly, his face now serious and wary.<br /><br />I frown. [AGAIN - she always frowns. Or he frowns. They frown a LOT.]  \\"You buy new, er ... toys ... for each submissive?\\"<br /><br />\\"Some things. Yes.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Butt plugs?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes.\\"<br /><br />So there you go. They come up again, so buy a copy and knock yourself out.<br /><br />Is 50 Shades Darker good? Hell to the no, it is not good. But is it entertaining? Yes. Is it hot? Yes. Is it worth reading? Yes. If you can get past all of the awful writing, it's very enjoyable. I admit that I read it cover to cover, and I look forward to 50 Shades Freed. Do not, however, mistake an enjoyable read for something well written, because this is NOT well written. It's like literary crack. You know it's bad for you, and you feel dirty and low for enjoying it, but you can't stop.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars. Don't judge me.<br /><br />If you want to know my thoughts on Fifty Shades Freed, check it: http://www.amazon.com/review/R16U7WCSXSQRJR/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm<br /><br />Published on cupcake's book cupboard. @VivaAmaRisatato the program.] Thank heavens I am wearing my jeans.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|very. interesting. and excusing keeps you envolved through out the reading I would recamend this reading to any one who likes this type of book
B003EI2EH2|2.0|I must say I think the idea of the book is great. A lot of the areas of personal improvement that are explored are certainly things I would like to improve myself.<br />The problem is I feel that this book will not help most people but rather move them in a wrong or at least not very desirable direction, which is mainly taking more and more supplements to try to accomplish anything and everything.<br />The author himself often states that this or that supplement he used is not recommended because of its side effects but still recommends so many others, while mentioning and sometimes not the possible side effects.<br />All this to conclude (in the appendix) that we can only supplement in what we know, which is possibly a very small portions of what actually is. Well, I'm concerned that these short term results will be shadowed by longer term diseases, like pretty much all performance enhancement drugs do in a way or another. This book is really the apology of do it today, whatever it costs (money and health wise), just continue doing whatever you're doing (nothing wrong about eating pretty much anything at all), just pop some pills and do some funny exercises and the rest you should just not worry about it.<br />Very dangerous attitude if you want my opinion.<br />There are a few interesting things and experiments in the book but they are almost completely lost in a ocean of doubtful practices and recommendations.<br />Do they work? Maybe.<br />Do I want to endanger my life to try to reach some of my goals? Probably not, at least not intentionally!<br />I would love to see a similar book but using natural methods (although the author would probably say that his methods are natural).<br />All I could see is that the author is trying to justify whatever he already does (e.g. what he eats) by finding (or not finding) any possible scientific study that goes along his lines and just have fun with it.<br />Not really what I was looking for<br />If it works for you, great!Not my way of conducting my life. I respect my body too much

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|When I saw this, I had no idea that there were another complete version of the work available, but had been told the novel was great by my wife.  This film so completely absorbed and fascinated me that I watched it twice on a trans-Atlantic flight, each time reveling in the details and the absolutely superlative acting.  We know Craig is first rate - but so is Roony, whom I had never seen before.  Indeed, she is pitch perfect:  a damaged, enigmatic woman full of rage, with a particular talent, perhaps even genius, and a streak of cruelty.  I will have to buy this when the price is right, as I will want to watch it many more times.  I will get the other versions as well.<br /><br />A disgraced journalist, Craig, is given a task by an ailing industrial magnate, who recognizes his family is full of crazies.  Craig becomes absorbed in the task, eventually taking on Roony as his assistant.  She soon proves invaluable, fighting her own battles all the while and emerging as a stunning and dangerous beauty.  Somehow, he touches her heart, unlocking secrets but also sensitivity and pain.  What they find was a complete surprise to me in all of its facets.  I don't want to reveal the plot, as it has many quirky twists that add subtle tastes to a somewhat traditional film noire plot line.  But the resolution, and the girl's actions, make this the most deliciously wicked treat.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.

B004LROMWU|5.0|I must say that I enjoy this show immensely! The cast is great and the story, to me, is interesting. Maybe I'm a nerd, but still. Anyway, what I like most about Falling Skies is the lack of filth that plagues most of what is on TV today. The focus of the show is not who sleeps with who and how many times, it is not overrun with foul language, the story is character driven without all of that unnecessary idiocy involved. Morality still has a place in this show and, as long as it does, I will continue to enjoy it! I also like that the show doesn't follow the overused hospital or cop drama setting. I'm sick and tired of FBI, CIA, this hospital, that hospital, blah blah blah...For once someone decided to use a little imagination in the creation of a show. Thank God someone still has a little creativity! Watch this show if you want something different and just as exciting.

B002R1SS86|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Superb acting by a superb cast. Special effects were perfectly balanced - not overdone and complimented brilliantly the acting and story without overwhelming the film.<br /><br />Of course the story is well known and there are many versions available but this one unquestionably is one of the very best I have seen! No matter how many Robin Hood films you have seen I promise this is the one that you will enjoy the most. It had a splendid variation in the details. There was not an overemphasis on any one character and it had a wonderful way of projecting each character's point of view.<br /><br />The casting was perfect! All the actors performed extremely well and they are ALL very talented people to begin with so you will definitely not be disappointed!<br /><br />As the earlier review stated, it was more realistic than any other I have seen. There was only one spot (less than a minute long) that I thought to myself - \\"Quit dragging this scene out\\" ... but that was because I was so caught up in the film - it was truly exciting to watch! Face it, we all have seen and grown up with this tale and know the story well. This is a masterpiece that created a fresh new excitement in an age old tale that is so well known!

He has an affair with a married woman and continues unwilling to honor her need to love through parenting.<br /><br />Through World War I the boy experiences the challenges of adulthood, accepting responsibility for making decisions which impact others. The intensity of the combat scenes and his moments of choice are compelling illustrations of the rigors of battle, a telescoped and exaggerated trajectory of maturation not everyone survives.

His paramour also suffers blast trauma PTSD from a German bomb to her home.<br /><br />The boy tries to protect and mentor a younger tunnel digger, introducing him to a brothel, and assigning him the task of lookout so the younger never enters the carbon monoxide filled tunnels. Eventually he learns no one can control another's life or death. [[ASIN:B000Z8GZYW Groundhog Day (Special 15th Anniversary Edition)]]<br /><br />The boy is befriended by an older miner who advises him that love is all there is \\"to love and to be loved in return.\\" This advice provides the motivation the boy needs to survive long enough to contemplate his own coming of age and meaning in life.<br /><br />The boy's immaturity due to being without role models for appropriate parenting seems prolonged, as he resists any suggestion that parenting is an honorable state. My own parents loved each other deeply and loved me as well. I was allowed curiosity about unfamiliar cultures religions geographies because of the strong grounding of knowing I was treasured.

1451627289|1.0|11.22.63 is a large piece of REALLY bad writing; it is cliché ridden - both in the phrases used and the content. The book is way too long, bogged down with details that do not move the story along or develop the characters. It sports a dreadfully executed romance (the sex scenes and use of the term \\"poundcake\\" are beyond cringeworthy) and there is so little real character development that whatever is between the people (not much) evoked less than zero emotional response in me. The lead, who tells the story first person, is completely over the top and impossible to take seriously. \\"Back to the Future\\" (from which, embarrassingly, 11.22.63 borrows much) featured a more realistic method of time travel. Having never read a Stephen King novel before, and seeing the abundance of gushing 5 star reviews others have written, it's highly doubtful that I will ever endure another.
0345803485|1.0|I'm more than 70% into the book and so far, one brief kiss.  Whoop-de-doo.  Makes me sad for those expecting some serious erotica.  Lady Chatterley's Lover (D.H. Lawrence) is beyond this in all respects, including erotic scenes and overall writing.  The Story of O (Pauline Reage) is much more engaging as well, and is packed with real sex scenes.  50 Shades of Grey is sophomoric at best, and a waste of time at worst.  If I have to read one more sentence ending with \\"...he smiled wickedly,\\" I think I'm going to scream.  So many hardworking, diligent, talented authors out there who deserve readers' attention.  Ms. James is not one of them.  Ok, she may be hardworking, but talented?  A 9th grader could have written this. Her management and PR team really outdid themselves.  It's the lesson from the Emperor's New Clothes.
0345803485|1.0|I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have started and not finished. This is one of them. I have enjoyed reading the other 1 star posts of readers who feel the same way. I am not a book snob. I am not a prude. I love a good 'romance' novel. It is beyond me why this book is being raved about by so many, particularly women. Since when is being in a controling and yes, abusive relationship hot and/or sexy? Perhaps I would have found it appealing vs appalling if the woman was an adult who has experienced normal, healthy, sexual relationships in her life and now wanted to try something new/different. To have a 21 year old girl with no experience enter into this scene is just disturbing. Regardless, my beef with the book isn't about 'the plot', to use the term lightly. It's the writing. It is just beyond bad. It reminds me of my own feeble attemps at writing when I was a Freshman in high school - without the S&M, of course. If I had the patience, I would love to go through and count how many times the same phrases are repeated. \\"Stop biting your lower lip.\\" \\"Are you biting your lower lip?\\" \\"You know it makes me crazy when you bite your lower lip.\\" That's just one example. I could go on, but I will stop before my inner goddess (really?) starts dancing around.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved the book, couldn't put it down. I was impressed by her courage to make this incredible journey, her courage to look back on her life and come to terms with her mistakes as well as her mother's. The high point for me was that she ultimately was able to recognize and accept the weakness and the strengths in both herself and her Mom. I'm not sure she knew that looking back at her life would allow her to move forward. But by following her heart she grew into a strong, independent and centered woman who could begin to live a more normal life.<br /><br /> This is a great read for everyone but for women it has a special message, much like my favorite Helen Reddy song- I am Woman. Women (and men) can do anything we aspire to as long as we consider our personal strengths and weakness and adjust accordingly.<br /><br /> This is an amazing woman. By the time I finished the book she felt like a friend.

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Another couple brought this game over to play yesterday. I've never built anything with Legos before, so I was skeptical at first. But it was a total blast. Don't get too caught up in accurately portraying what's on the card. You just need to do it good enough so other's can guess. (Guessing is half the fun.) For us, choosing the color of bricks we used was one of the most important clues to our build. Someone had a nature category and they started building with green legos and already we were shouting out..frog, alligator, leaf...etc.  The little man lego is very helpful for building context around your item too. Believe me, none of the things we built actually LOOKED like the things on the card, but it was a riot. We played very quickly and only spent more than 5 minutes on a couple of builds (andwe used mostly the hardest category cards.) I do agree sometimes the categories don't seem right. For instance, none of us thought 'alarm clock' should be on the EASY card, but it was. I'm already buying this game for my 11 year old nephew and I look forward to playing it with him and others.

6304806418|5.0|Excellent DVD and well worth the money.  Just don't expect a history lesson as there is much much more to the story, but this is a well done entertainment video.  Many other stars besides Madonna such as Antonio Banderas. The segments _The Lady has Potential_ and _A New Argentina_ are not as well known as _Don't Cry For Me Argentina_  should be more widely known.
1466401885|4.0|I bought this book because the ratings were so high and I didn't find it awful but I did find it exhausting. I thought the couples fighting was a bit over-the-top and the ending was just as unbelievable.<br /><br />Abby, the girl who is portrayed as the \\"good girl\\" meets Travis, the \\"bad boy\\" on campus at one of his fights. America, her best friend, is there with her boyfriend, Shepley, who is Travis's cousin. Right off the bat, Travis and Abby hit it off, eventually, they become boyfriend and girlfriend and then the crap hits the fan - over and over and over again. One minute Abby hates Travis (while Travis has nothing but love for Abby), then she loves him... One minute they are dating, the next minute they aren't. They are forever making a scene on campus somewhere... A beautiful disaster.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Such a great show.  I love that it keeps the mystery going and that these are some of the characters you grew up knowing, but with an adult, darker twist to it.  It's what is keeping me hooked.  A must have on my shelf and a double bonus for being on Blu-Ray.
B006P0FICE|5.0|I seem this movie on a regular dvd and liked it so well I wanted a blu-ray copy.  I found a copy here at the price that I wanted to pay.  It turned out great.  Thanks
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining game.  Now, if we can get Temple Run and Virtual Families, that'd be awesome!
B0034FJGEY|5.0|Shake Hands with the Devil written by Lieutenant General Dallaire reads like a horror movie which you can't turn off because of being shocked into denial; until you accept the fact that it is a non-fiction. You wonder, \\"Where was I when this was happening\\"? The book certainly brings about conviction concerning humanity's hard heart toward each other. It unmasks greed, prejudice and cowardice but shows that not everyone has lost its humanity; as is demonstrated by all the soldiers who gave their lives in an unselfish sacrifice towards peace.
B0055S348W|1.0|Purchased this app for my Kindle based on the good reviews...big mistake! The app detects my wireless printer, but apparently there's no driver for it. I tried using numerous related and generic drivers as recommended. When I try to print something, my printer detects incoming data (got excited at first as I thought things were working)....but nothing prints. After many attempts to no avail I'm dumping this junk out of my Kindle. Don't waste your money.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|it is what u would expect and helps me a lot with my bills which is very nice and blah
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I use the Cosmonaut stylus on my 3rd gen ipad.  I have found that I rarely touch the screen anymore due to the performance of the stylus.  Of course this cuts down on the amount of times I have to wipe the screen.  When researching this stylus I was a little concerned about the thickness and how it would feel, but I was surprised at how natural it feels.  Some people might would have an issue with the stylus fitting in their stylus loop, but my ipad case doesn't have a loop anyway.<br /><br />I have children that use the ipad for games and educational purposes, and they have no problem using the stylus.  In fact, I am most happy with the fact that the kids rarely need to touch the screen since their hands are usually disgusting.  :o)  I think anyone that buys this stylus will be pleased with the functionality and feel.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great weather app, love it when display on notification bar. shoe degree with noticeable color. easy and intuitive to use.
B0054JELS4|5.0|The product arrived just in time! I had ordered it as a birthday present for my wife and was hoping it would arrive by the scheduled date; it arrived a few days before I expected it to so everything was perfect! My wife loves the series and now she can watch them without commercial whenever she wants.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was excellent - Suzanne Collins really did an outstanding job continuing and ending the trilogy. As with the other two books, I literally could not stop reading...I found myself reading it whenever I could! It's all my friends ever talk about, and even my family members go on and on about the book. Reading this book was like watching a movie...if you enjoyed The Hunger Games (book #1) and Catching Fire (book #2) as much as I did, you definitely will want to read Mockingjay. I laughed, cried, and felt many other emotions while reading the book. It may only be a story, but Suzanne's words will definitely worm their way in to you...after hearing nothing other than about The Hunger Games for so long, I FINALLY decided to read it and fell in love with it. I highly recommend it...especially if you've already read the other two!! This book is FULL of surprises, and believe me when I say that! You will find yourself pleasantly surprised and itching with anticipation at each turn. This one is a nail-biter...an excellent book. :) The ending of the book, however, did end quite abruptly, which I wasn't thrilled about - i was hoping for a smoother ending than there was. There are some slow parts in the book as well... but all in all, if you read the first two books, you must read this last one. :)
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game rocks! caution: it is ADDICTIVE! the game is FREE!!!! u control ur spending. don't be discouraged by the negative reviews. try it for yourself. and get bakery story too. add me sativafari.

1741798981|5.0|London has always fascinated me. I never had the opportunity to visit London, though. I wanted this book to see what lies deeper in the city than what I have read and seen on television and in books. What if I had a chance to visit London. Would this be a book I'd depend on to help me make the most of my visit? I believe it would. There are maps to guide me, photographs... wish there were more, but this isn't a photo guide! I can select from the restaurants I'd enjoy, the sights I'd like to see, places to visit. It's all in this helpful guide. I recommend this to anyone that is planning a trip to London or trying to decide if they should visit London. Great travel guide... highly recommended!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is the best free app ever download this game! trust me you have nothing to lose! it is 40 times better than sketch with friends! get this game

B005LAIHBS|4.0|The movie follows a plot similar to \\"Escape from New York City,\\" but other than Guy Pearce as Snow, it lacks memorable characters. In 2079, Guy is convicted of murder and espionage. In order to beat the rap he must rescue the President's daughter from an orbiting space prison...apparently built after a crazy ideas man gets elected president. I started making a list of the science flaws and quit after half a page. My other column for absurdities was equally as long. Clearly this is a \\"leave your brain at the door\\" movie.<br /><br />Guy is a wise cracking individual. His humor is enjoyable, even if corny at times. Of course the President's daughter (Maggie Grace) objects to being the only hostage being rescued. Good comedy-action sci-fi story.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|lot of defense in this app.I would cheer for the zombies sense they rose from the dead!That's the part I like about zombies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's a very fun and entertaining app with challenges that are good for all ages. Also it has a veriety in style from other games.
