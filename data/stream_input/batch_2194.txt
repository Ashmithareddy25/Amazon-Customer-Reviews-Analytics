B0031Q0XCA|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, and was surprised at the end. Very different, romance type story. The acting was exceptional, I will watch it again.
B000001E3V|4.0|This is a great record when some fantastic jamming on it; I really can say no wrong. But they should have re-released it's predecessor &#34;Derek & the Dominoes in Concert&#34;. While you can still get the ladder, it is expensive. This suffices nicely in it's place. Clapton like you've never heard him.
1594202710|4.0|Entertaining but too subjective a political reading.<br />Would buy a smaller format paperback if available.<br />HK's books are not always easy reading.
B008518MOW|5.0|One of the reasons I picked this movie ,was I own the first two MIB, now I have the whole collection.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|As a kid, I did not understand terms such as treason and insurrection while watching this in 1978. I am sure glad to have found this four disc version and appreciate the movie better this time round.<br /><br />First of all, I thought the casting was excellent:<br /><br />Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent is a little awkward and lacking in confidence, the kind that gets his hand caught in revolving doors. And Reeve did look like Superman physically and he was confident and cool. Very natural in both roles.<br /><br />Margot Kidder is perfect as the sharp tongued reporter Lois Lane. (Recall Gale Weathers in Scream?) Lois frequently makes spelling mistakes and gets told by her editor there's \\"only one p in rapist\\". Thank whoever invented spell check. One of Lois' interview questions for Superman was \\"How big are you?\\" She then changes the question quickly to \\"How tall are you?\\" What a size queen. LOL.<br /><br />Gene Hackman turns Lex Luthor into a very funny and likable \\"criminal mind of our time\\".<br /><br />Ned Beatty is perfect as the bumbling Otis who constantly goofs up. I think the only reason Luthor keeps him is that Otis is too dense to be a threat.<br /><br />Valerie Perrine - Lex's va va voom female companion always referred to formally as Miss Teschmacher. Actually, she is pretty kind and smart. One of the funniest scene was when Superman flies through the ceiling sending debris raining down. And Eve Teschmacher just walks calmly away as if oblivious to it all.<br /><br />This package contains three Superman films:<br /><br />* The theatrical version.<br />* The expanded version. Here you get more footage of Marlon Brando's character Jor-El. More on him dealing with the council. You see him explaining to the young Kal-El how to deal with people. Kinds of plugs in the gap about where Superman gets his lessons from. Brando was reportedly paid millions for this. There's also more footage on how Lex tries to destroy Superman.<br />* A vintage 1951 black and whitefilm starring George Reeves has quirky mole men coming out of the ground.<br /><br />Extras include making ofs, director commentary, documentaries, several 1940s cartoons, screen tests (watch Stockard Channing from Grease audition for Lois Lane), a vintage TV special and several audio tracks (close to a CD soundtrack).<br /><br />As a movie, Superman encapsulates drama, comedy, romance and a disaster film all rolled into one. It was very moving at parts. His earth parents found this boy with the outstretched arms and a big smile and raised him as their own. And his father's sudden death when Clark was a teen.<br /><br />One of the most romantic moments in cinematic history was when Superman takes Lois Lane  flying and the song lyrics to Can You Read My Mind was spoken by Lane.<br /><br />And it borrows from the Bible. Superman was sent to earth by his father so that he could help people. Just like Jesus Christ who is the spiritual saviour, Superman is the physical saviour. Just as God cast Satan into hell, the three insurrectionists - General Zod, Ursa and Non are condemned by Jor-El to eternal exile in the Phantom Zone. And is it a coincidence that the infant Kal-El travels to earth in a ship shaped like a star? A reference to The Star of Bethlehem when Christ was born?<br /><br />This movie also runs the constant theme of how aliens are superior to humans. Check out Alien, Predator, Alien Vs Predator, Prometheus and I'm sure there are others.<br /><br />This 1978 version is a tough act to follow and I don't think even the recent Superman Returns can top it.
B00514HDNW|5.0|A great read. I highly recommend it,  I couldn't put it down. I want to read more by Richard Matheson
B000H0MKO2|5.0|Thank You For Smoking is a sly irreverent film that takes shots at the tobacco industry - both above and below the belt. Most of the time with straight faces.<br /><br />Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a lobbyist for the stuff that causes lung cancer. Like Satan in the flesh, he can sell ice to Eskimos and make black seem whiter than white. Nick even manages to win over a cancer patient in a talk show and I enjoy his unorthodox reasoning skills - he tells his son Joey (Cameron Bright) about &#34;flexible morals&#34;. All goes well for this spin doc till he meets a young reporter (Katie Holmes) who serves his bedroom secrets for public consumption. Parroting Naylor, she says she's doing it for the mortgage. You'll have to watch to see how he bounces back.<br /><br />Intelligent and funny, Thank You For Smoking will blow smoke rings around you with its satirical references. I was totally tickled pink at the irony of it all. A must have in your video library!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was ok I use it to look up words I don't know it helps me with my job too.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|This has to be the best scary movie that ive seen in a really long time.  This is a movie you can watch over and over and pick up on things you didnt see the first time.

B0027MJU00|5.0|Read Girl Gone. Had to read another one and realized I had read Sharp Objects a year or so earlier and it freaked me out. This book just stayed in that same line. Great story, good twists. And patiently waiting for another Gillian book!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey is just great. Love the characters and the costumes!!! Wished I could have lived at Downton Abbey at that time in history. How exciting!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The movie was good up until the plane crash.  Then same old storyline of how an alcoholic remains in denial then finally realizes his problem in the 11th hour to save his girlfriend.

B009GX69RK|5.0|long ago i saw two random episodes on TV of new girl, one time from late in season one, one time from early season 2. I remember thinking the characters weren't a good fit for one another. I went back and watched it from the pilot all the way up through the current middle of season 2, and i love this show, it's hilarious. characters are meant to have awkward relationships with one another. this is sort of incidental humor, and it's great. definitely watch season 1 first
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really cool free app. It's nice to have a better idea of how much battery life you have left
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|this show is hilarious. definitely watch it from the beginning of season 1 or the relationships don't make very much sense. i love this
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is an excellent book; heard it about on the Glenn Beck (radio) program; listened to a review and decided to purchase this.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben Affleck has done his homework here and it shows. It is really well done. This is what the spy world is really all about. As much as Americans want to predict the future through controling everything, we can only react to the unpredictable forces called human actions. This is one of these moments. As the Marines say, adapt and overcome. Argo shows us how this was done and done well. You will not be disappointed because it is base on actual events. I highly recommend it.
B005C0DHIK|4.0|I thought it was worth 4 stars because I think it enlightens the people to the dangers<br />of fracking and the carelessness of those on the job. The color in the film could have<br />used some improvement. It was quite dark.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Part 3 has a real shocker for an ending. I was not prepared for it. Part 4 has to pick up the pieces from this one. But what direction will it go? I am looking forward to seeing it. I highly recommend the whole series.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|The soundtrack alone will have you glancing over your shoulder constantly. I will surely be adding this little jewel to my \\"What to watch during Halloween\\" collection....
B007B6VOG0|3.0|I love the songs that play on the radio. I was expecting more from Fun. I was expecting a CD of Fun. songs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game it is the best game ever on earth  me and my friend both have it and we both love

B008MG1E4A|5.0|An excellent, firsthand account of the arduous training involved in becoming not just a Navy Seal, but a member of the elite team given the task of neutralizing Bin Laden.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|The man and the music are unbelievable. His story couldn't have been more fanastic if it had come out of Hollywood instead of an independent documentary. I was inspired by the man and his music, a truely great work of art.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is not lacking in action, tragedy, vibrant detail, and a twisted plot. The author is successful in creating mixed emotions in the reader with all of the gory details and turns that the story takes.  I found myself unable to keep allegiance to any given character, not knowing what could happen next.  Just as the first two, this book called to me; I highly recommend this series.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I like this app so much better than the regular Facebook app. I could only see photo posts very large and nothing else. With this full facebook app it looks like what i see on my laptop or pc.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|At first I just thought this would be another book I'd be able to predict the end, but I was completely wrong. This story has a sweet and blissful even though both Katie and Alex both experience hardships. I enjoyed the book and definitely recommend it to others.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|love love love this cd I had it before but it got away from me. Glad I found it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed Hoover's first 2 books, so I was excited to find out she had another one out. This book was incredible...I found myself laughing, crying, falling in love with Sky and Holder, angry, and then all over again. This book spoke to me while I read it and felt like I was experiencing Sky and Holder's relationship with them. Loved the book and definitely recommend it to others to read. Colleen Hoover has easily become one of my favorite authors!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|This book started out as though it was going to be very good. But the rest of the book turned out to be amazingly repetitive.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Very unpredictable plot, and very good humor. Nothings cheesy as with most alien movies. I've watched it over 3 times now and its great everytime
B001O5DR3W|5.0|The quality is the best I've ever seen in this tpye of product and you certainly can't go wrong with getting it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's a fun game but I do like the Rio subway surfers better than rome subway surfers it's addicting and fun that's pretty much it
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Just as the summary says: a biography of Shin Dong-Hyuk.  Born in a prison camp, starved and tortured and beaten his entire life, and then, with luck, escaped from the camp and then escaped from North korea.<br /><br />Harden records the story well: unsparing, detailed, and with little drama.  I'm glad that he used his talent to produce this vital book, and I'm grateful to Shin for the undoubted stress and travail of going public.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Rick Riordan did it again I love his book an all ways will. The book was a great twist and is worth all five stars
B00B3EVNEE|4.0|I have been a fan of Mr. Trower since the late 60's -- here again he delivers the excellent phrasing and tonality I have always enjoyed about his guitar playing. My only complaint is the lack of credits when buying online -- which songs does he sing? Who's playing? Would be nice to know...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun, exciting and addictive game for adults and children of all ages. I can spend hours playing and love competing with family and friends.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The average person fears change.<br /><br />So when an artist/band decides to 'evolve' their sound, especially one with such a distinct (and arguably 'limited') sound as The Strokes, it's sure to draw a slew of quick reactions, many of them often critical.<br /><br />The first four songs of this album may very well remind you of The Strokes that you're accustomed to (or serve as an attempt to do so), but the middle (the bulk) of this album (tracks 5-11) will have you asking yourself the very same thing that The Strokes named their first song of their first [great] album: Is this it???<br /><br />Luckily, the best is saved for last as two of the last three songs revive a polarizing and arguably 'alienating' album.  While this is easily the weakest of The Strokes first three albums and there is nothing 'new' here, overall and if nothing else, there are enough songs which 'hit their mark' and find themselves worthy of a playlist add.<br /><br />Three and a half (3 1/2) stars, rounded to four since ratings systems are simple and flawed.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is AWESOME and the following problems aren't true: you don't need Wi-Fi to play,the update doesn't delete your progress,&amp;
0439023521|5.0|Eerie, but great!  Couldn't put it down.  Can somewhat see this happening in real life, which is REALLY scary.  The story itself is very original; a great read, compellingly written-- have already ordered the 2 sequels and can't wait to get them!!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks once again captures captures our imagination of a forbidden love twisted with mystery and surprise and romantic fascination.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are at all interested about the mission or a serviceman perspective then this book is for you. Fast read.
1426209584|5.0|Years of searching has produced a magnificent record of these most elusive birds.Set out in an easy to read but scientific format, each with details of location, habitat and wow those photos! Thank you to Laman & Scholes for this great book,  a treasure.
B008220C38|1.0|This was a very poor remake of other movies of the same title. The book is a great classic and they destroy it by this garbage movie.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I absolutly love all of Lindsey Stirling's music. I'm in the Navy and on deployment and everytime I would play one of her you tube video's off my laptop everyone would ask who she was. I really hope she continues to come out with more albums in the future. This is the first cd I've looked forward to buying in like 5 years, and I listen to everything from rap, to heavy metal, to clasical and dubstep. It's amazing how fluid she mixed different sounds with her violin.
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|Very exciting movie. The girl that played the lead part deserves an academy award for her performance. She really had me into movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok. I will only be honest. It is amazing and fun... I am addicted to it. But it does get glitchy sometimes.. otherwise it is sooo fun!!!!!!
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|This a so-so making of a real life story that was pretty boring. Needed more action and less talking but it did have some nail biting scenes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't know what to say, it's a must see. It's not your typical zombie movie (series).  The story-telling is great and the acting is what makes it happen.
B007REV4T8|1.0|This was the worst James Bond movie made yet. Destroying a prefect classic card was terrible and blowing iup a castle showed poor taste. This was not a James Bond movie especially when he was just getting drunk. I do not cxare what you think of my review so keep your commentsw to yourself moron.+
1884883303|5.0|I have a small collection of vintage guitars (15) and this is considered the best guide for current values by many people.  It is invaluable when deciding to sell an instrument or adding one to the collection.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I purchased 2... One for my Husband and one for my brother. They love them, now my Father wants one. HAHA. Since Amazon is out of stock I went to FletcherAndersons.com and ordered 2 more. Way to go Schrade!!
B0045EJY90|5.0|CD playback sounded fine but the USB playback was extremely bass heavy, so I replaced it with a Yamaha CD Player
B002QW7AJY|5.0|I like this movie it has quite a bit of action and a few twists and turns in it! i would recommend it!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was truly magnificent and the detail and words the author used were both intricate and beautiful. You can tell how thought out every page of this book was and it made threading even more fabulous!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I bought this to hook mics and guitars into my computer for recording and it has a nice clean sound no problems!  and price was great. Behringer makes some pretty good stuff I'm happy with it!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|One the most thought provoking and powerful novels I have ever read. It was somehow better than the Maze Runner. Fantastic.
B002Z8LPZ4|3.0|I like Kate Beckinsale I mean who doesn't?  but this movie struggled to keep me interested!  I would say it is average at best!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|After totally falling in love with the movie I wanted to be able to relive the experience through the music. Since the soundtrack was just highlights, I bought this to have everything. I am so glad I did. Thought I might miss not hearing the stars from the movie ( I thought they were great), but these artists are all wonderfull.
B002POMLHY|5.0|I've only heard like 2 Breaking Benjamin songs that i do not like and they have several CD's out now!  and this one definitely does not disappoint!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|What is there is good quality and the photographs are well done.  Try the trial version of this first I believe it is called the lite version.  See if you like it before you buy.  Easy to use and programmable too.  The graphics are excellent and the sound quality is nice.  Since this review they have added some new sounds and I would recommend it highly.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish.. loved all the ups and downs and growing to love and forgive, learning as they went..
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have many sleep and relaxation sound machine apps.  This is one of my two favorites.  There are several options for sounds from airplanes to frying bacon (ok it really sounds kind of neat).<br /><br />You have a nice picture to look at while the sound is playing, settings so it can be personalized and a timer and wake up options.  Volume of sounds are adjustable.<br /><br />I highly recommend this one for ease of use, price and quality.  They are also adding some new sounds with the same quality sound and graphics as their others.  Really great app!!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This was the worst thing of my life and I don't like it so good day sir or madam the worst
B00BK5D95C|3.0|Devendra Banhart would be rolling in his grave if he wasn't still alive. This band not only sounds like Devendra, but it sounds like they have been spending years trying to copy the phrasing style that he uses. This of course is entirely possible, because Devendra has been doing this for years. The songs are catchy... every one of them,  but please don't confuse this as new or original. This is a good record, but give some credit where credit is due. Here in a couple weeks, Devendra and alt-J will both be playing in Austin at SXSW.. I wonder if alt-J could even look Devendra in the eye after such a blatant rip-off.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game.I'm 9 and I get bored easy.this game makes me have fun and I think everyone should by this if they get bored easy a lot.I love getting all the characters.
0375869026|5.0|I love this book and I don't know if I can say enough about it.I read one book after another, so I've read a lot of good books, but once in awhile I read a great book that shines brighter then a hundred others and this is one of those books and I think it should be required reading for all school kids including high school. Just loved all the characters, and each of them has a voice, funny and honest. A story with a simple message~ Just be KIND!
1451695195|5.0|After reading this book it truly turned my spiritual belief around. I now feel differently than how I've felt before about my religion and who God truly is. I highly recommend this to anyone who might be struggling with their spirituality or just want a new perspective on the heavenly, divine, and loving being who created us.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Istarted using facebook to keep up with my kids. Now they are grown and I still us it to keep up with what is going on in her life and so many moments are shared of my grandson as he grows up!
1401324649|5.0|The book is an absolute stitch.<br />A bizarre plot that may evoke Forrest Gump for some; a plot that goes from crisis to crisis, leaving you wondering what could possibly come next as Allan Karlsson somehow manages to be the detail that makes all the difference at key points in the history of the past 80 years...all of this as slapstick delivered in a low key style; enjoy!<br />Robert Bottome
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is one of my favorite sites!<br />Lots of helpful hints and so much more! I have used Pinterest for reciepts, crafts, sewing, and decorating ideas as well as photography.<br />A site full of shared ideas and information.

B000FA6720|5.0|True love never dies... just like Francesca, sometimes we stay because it's the right thing to do but if we are \\"in love\\" with someone, the love will always linger on or haunt us even... Stay if you must or leave if you can. One thing is for sure, love is powerful! A toast to true love!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so epic and my friend loves it to John Harry game ham hello tame came you I play it every day because I love it so much
B0041KKYD8|4.0|Good movie to watch if your an adult but not a good choice for children. It has a good plot line and really goes all out on the bloody mess.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|True Tarentino.  Part autobiography, part wish fulfillment before that Hollywood pandering crap that is Inglorious Basterds.  This is his raw best.  The best look into him.  I loved it, and wish he'd write more like it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Wow. Just, wow.  I wish I was a poet or could convey how truly special this book is.  I love Apple products and I started reading this book to try to understand the man who was behind the company.  I got that and so much more.  I find myself angry that Steve was taken so early and that the world will not be able to benefit from his future inventions, sad for his close friends and family, and motivated to follow my own passions.  Walter is an amazing writer. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.  It's well worth your time.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|After update my son can't play says problem downloading and it already downloaded and installed on his tablet please fix
B0000844I8|5.0|Surely nothing more need be said of the film with over 500 reviews on Amazon and a goodly number of years since its initial issuance. Most seem to be Science Fiction fans and I am not. In fact, never had heard of Stargate nor most others that have built great sales records, since I do not watch over-the-air (so to speak) television but do watch DVD versions of some that come to my attention. How did this sample of the current scene strike this alien to it: it was good fun, a remake of a thousand basically similar films made in the last century, with the addition of the material that makes it superficially \\"new\\". That's not a criticism, just a statement of fact. In films as in most plays, television programs and novels, it's essentially, \\"not what you do but the way that you do it\\" (as Duke Ellington and pet lyricist told us long ago).<br />So, my recommendation to those who somehow let it pass them by, is: Take a look; don't take it seriously, and you should enjoy it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|These books are long with lots of characters and plot lines.  Usually I can figure out where an author is headed but with Mr. Martin I'm just along for the ride, reading as fast as I can so see what happens next.
0525953590|5.0|Prof. Carroll appears to know all the questions an informed non-professional particle physicist would ask. In fact, these are the questions he would ask.  His answers are very satisfying yet tantalyzing; they leave one wishing to be even better informed and more able to follow the tough mathematical arguments which are only for the pros. I dusted off my old field theory texts in hopes of getting just a bit closer to understanding the role of symmetry: It's a work in progress.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I'm looking forward to season 2 even though I know I won't find out.  Part of the mystery of this series is whether the main character is who he seems to be and it wouldn't work as well if the answer was revealed too soon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun to play, challenge level grows gradually, but u can jump ahead to your level of challenge. My seven year old enjoys it and so do I.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have almost finished book 4 and I'm not dissapointed.  These books are so long and involved I can't believe Mr. Martin can keep my interest peaked the way he does.  Usually an author uses the same scenes over and over with minor changes, not here and I'm looking forward to the next book.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|Loved the movie! Good audio and sound quality, and it also loaded very quickly. Great movie too, very good rent
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Many times over the years I have been dissapointed when I read a good book and later saw the movie.  The director had a much different intrepretation than I had.  This is not the case with &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;.  It is very well done and true to the books.  There are so many plot lines and characters they can't possible go into the depths the written word can.  Having read the books I have a better understanding of what  is happening on the screen.  Knowing ahead of time what is going to happen doesn't spoil it for me in the least.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey is a really fine series, watched it on PBS, ordered all 3 seasons on BR, season 1 & 2 played just fine, season 3, even though it clearly says for customers of the USA, I got a code A version and will not play on my OPPO BR player,(strange, because I thought region A was the same as region 1) careful when ordering, but really enjoy the series if you got the correct regional code, because it's outstanding
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Other than special effects this movie has very little going for it.  I was not sympathetic to the characters at all.
0425252868|5.0|Wonderful book, read the second time and get to know the struggles this man went through. I will pass this book on to family members.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|I like the behind the scenes stuff and this movie is for people like me.  If you don't care how movies get made you probably won't like this one.  Ms. Mirren steals the movie with superb acting.  Mr. Hopkins is good as always portraying Hitchcock as somebody that only a loving wife could understand or like which, from what I hear, is pretty accurate.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have been a Nicholas Sparks fan for a long time and it has been a while since I have read one of his books.  I picked this one up and once again I wasn't disappointed.  I walked away with a smile on my face and a bit of renewed faith in the power of love.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|If you're into sword fighting and bows and arrows and knights in not so shining armor this for you.  If you prefer a more traditional Snow White then stick to Disney.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is probably one of the best DVD's that I have ever heard. I am a musician and know when notes are played correctly. Joe Walsh says there is no such thing as a perfect live performance, but that is the beauty of playing live. You won't be able to find a missed note in this DVD. It is excellent even if you don't like the Eagles that much. Pink Floyd is the other band that doesn't miss notes in a Live show. I saw Van Halen w/Roth and they were terrible. Roth could not even sing the words - David Lee Roth is crap. Sammy blows him away.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie even though it is a &#34;cartoon&#34;.  This may be an animated film bit it isn't for young children.  Some scenes are just too intense.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|A more light-hearted version than the one with Kiera Knightly. I enjoyed the comedy in this series and thought Romola Garai did a fabulous job in the lead!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm almost finished with book 4 and looking forward to 5.  I have no idea where this ride will take me but I can't wait to get there.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this game is very fun but I just think the people need to be a little bit cheaper because I have been playing for a week or two ok and dot even have enough for the cheapest player but over all I think it is a very cool game.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Read the book before watching the video and you will have a much better understanding of what is going on.  The acting, costumes, and scenery are well done.  I also bought season 2 and am looking forward to season 3.
B000SSV8HI|3.0|I ordered this CD to follow Mick Jagger's dance routines hoping I would lose weight and be as skinny as he is.  Did not work for me but that might be because after the workout I would eat something very sweet and very fattening.  Music is good; CD was in the condition I expected; and price was right.
B006RXQ2CY|4.0|What else do I need?  She's very good at what she does and portrays the Queen as I perceive her to be.  This movie covers the time of Princess Di's death and how the royal family reacted.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Wake up to your favorite music and works reliabley all of the time so you don't have to use any of the other apps and it's free
B0098VXMNE|4.0|There seemed to me to be too much reliance on the slo-mo scenes with rivers of blood splashing all over the screen and not enough story line.  I will be watching the next season when it is available to stream.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|can be very frustating at times, but the grandkids like it. It takes a lot of practice to figure this game out and they are bettrt at it than I am at age 74.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|His beautiful voice and thoughtful lyrics haven't changed, yet sound fresh. Such an enjoyable album! Love the remake of It's Cold Outside of Your Heart. The only thing I'd change is to skip the remix of Out There Somewhere when I add this to my MP3 player.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I recently saw this movie AT the movie theatre. It was a good movie, especially if you like Zeppelin as much as I do.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I was skeptical that Daddy's point of view would be intriguing but I was wrong. This book is greatly written, I simply couldn't put it down. Great book!
B00846REIS|5.0|If you are looking for a polished version of Fifty Shades, this is it!  I still have a love for Christian, but I think Gideon pushed ahead. The connection between Gideon and Eva is so strong. I love how they can both admit to their failings and provide allowances to each other. I love the friendship between Eva and Cary. This is a book that I will read again and again, and I look very forward to the final block - although I will be sorry to see it end. This has the right amount of steaminess, suspense, and interesting characters. This is my first Sylvia Day novel, and I will definitely look to reading others. She writes beautifully.
B000ND7O62|5.0|After my mom BEGGING me to find the Book Escape Artist By: Diane Chamberlain came upon this book and for the price I had to get it!! Needless to say SHE LOVED IT and ended up falling in love with some of the &#34;Other Authors&#34; in this very Great Book!! A must READ!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The sequel is everything I hoped for! The relationships, romance and suspense meet my hopes from 50 Shades - with better editing and less repetitive phrases. Not only has Gideon surpassed Christian for me, I think he just pushed past Mr. Darcy as well. What I love about this book is that Eva and Gideon not only grow in a relationship together, they grow as individuals. I think Eva is my favorite female romantic lead, and I love her strength at the end! I look forward to the third book, and I hope we see a wedding like we did for 50, but most of all I cannot wait to see how Eva reacts to the ultimate sacrifice that Gideon did for her and how it affects their relationship.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|This game sucks. Why on earth would Halfbrick make such a stupid game! I mean really this game is soooo stupid!!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Does what it says. Good app. I like the breakdown of all the estimates for time left using different functions of device.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|I did not consider myself a Zac Brown Band fan.  There were a couple of songs on this album that I liked, so at $5.00 I decided to buy the whole album.  Surprisingly I like most of the songs on the album.  They are upbeat, great musicianship, and fun.
B005USZYDU|2.0|This was the most disappointing book by J.Grisham that I have read.  Implausible and unlikely characters and plot.  Entirely to Pollyannaish.  Not even close to reality.
1440503257|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my Potter-loving daughter. I thought it would be fun to try out some of the unusually named recipes. The book is really nice. The cover and pages are very detailed and it looks a bit like it came from the actual Potter World. My one, and big, disappointment was that there was no recipe for Butter Beer....how could this be?? Did the author of this cookbook read the Harry Potter series? Of course, a quick Google search found the recipe which is what I would recommended instead of buying this cookbook. It's nice enough for a collector of Potter things but has collected a lot of dust at our house.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Awesome and completely original - listening to it on repeat since I purchased 3 days ago ! Love wing$, victory lap and can't hold us down especially
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the outcome of this story, it kept me up late At night reading, lost In the excitement of the unknown.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Another great collection of songs be Passion Pit. Their combination of energy and melody is always exciting to hear. Now I just need to hear some of these live!
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I wanted to like it. I was pretty scared and involved through most of the picture. Unfortunately, the end really ruined it for me. I mean, you invest a couple of hours into this thing and then get nothing at the end. It was okay, but I don't need to watch it again. Another thing that is a problem is the flash back, forward, sideways shots. Apparently, some director felt this would work instead of really explaining some important details in the film some other way. So, be aware, don't blink because you just might miss that super key detailed that would explain why you know who did you know what.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|The music is awesome, but out of context not as powerful.  The movie on Blu-Ray is the way to experience this.
B000AADYUI|5.0|I LOVED THE ORIGINAL LP WHEN IT CAME OUT (STILL HAVE IT JUST DONT HAVE A TURNTABLE ANYMORE).FOR THE MOST PART THIS IS OUTSTANDING MUSIC AND CONCEPT ALBUM WITH A FEW MISSTEPS THAT DONT DO MUCH FOR  YOU.HOWEVER THE ''GREAT'' PARTS FAR OVERSHADOW THE FEW WEAK SPOTS AND ARE OUTSTANDING.THEY WILL FIND RESIDENCE IN YOUR SOUL.ENJOY
B006GWO5NE|5.0|my grandson bent my cord so i purchased this for replacement.  Its very nice and just like the one that came with it!!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|This movie elicited many different emotions from me.My faithful companion and best friend had to be euthanized due to brain tumor May 29th,2009 and i cant even imagine going thru that pain again so i live vicariously now thru memories and fantasy.This movie was great for Horror genre buffs too as it followed the original FRANKENSTEIN story(which i also loved).SPARKY is a lovable rascal who will steal ur heart and the STOP/MOTION technique used for his movements was incredibly realistic.The fact that there's a happy ending just completes the package and i would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone with a heart,very uplifting and positive message.Enjoy it...!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I love Indie rock & electronic & this album is the perfect blend of both. Every song on here is incredible.
0385338686|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella, she has became one of my favorites. I laugh all the way thru her books and it's something new everytime. Can't wait for more from her!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|It's Harry potter. It's the last movie in the series. Of course it's pivotal to have and see this movie. But the epilogue almost ruined the whole series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am not a huge romance novel fan, but several friends encouraged me to read this book since it tends to be more on the \\"sweet side\\" of romantic rather than the sexual side and because I loved Point of Retreat and Slammed by the same author.  So, I read it.  Actually, I devoured it.  Literally could not put this book down!  I am very much now a fan of Colleen Hoover and will be snapping up any book she publishes on the day its available.
B000092WD8|5.0|could not ask for more  I enjoyed the movie and the quality of the  D V D  was clear and sharp
B005I6EVUG|5.0|My little Kindle Fire fits snugly and perfectly.  I'm traveling with it and it has protected while being cute.<br />The only thing that could make this product better was if it were foldable so you could a gle and adjust the Fire without holding it.<br />As a cover, I love it.
B00006FI51|5.0|everything was just as I wanted<br /><br />  reccomend to all....  fun movie for a fun time sharing together.... Thank you for just what I wanted
B005LAIHPY|5.0|If you are a sifi  buff then you should enjoy this movie, has lots of action and good story line and great acting with great visual & sound effects.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|giving this movie as a gift to a little girl who has never seen Dumbo  Can't wait to watch her reactions
0688091717|5.0|I was familiar with the book.  Read it to my grandson.<br />With the colorful illustrations it is a favorite among all<br />ages.  Highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In my opinion the game is really cool and you always want to play it.<br />It`s also very cool that there are differnt themes everytime :D
B001NLKT60|4.0|New author to me. Good plot. Good writing.  Will read more of this author. Good to finrd a readable New author
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is  really fun and I like it way better than the first one it has a lot  more things to do.
B0093IG5KY|5.0|My daughter loved this calendar!  It came in a timely manner.  I had originally ordered her a puppy calendar, but it never came (Amazon did give me a refund).  She is enjoying this calendar very much, especially since the movie is coming out today!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great read! Sort of anti climactic but a good ending nonetheless, I loved all the imagery and she really define  her style this time, it was nice that she had written from Jake's point of view
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|The plot is OK and the special effects (3D) are decent. Not something I'd recommend to friends, but would loan them my copy.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought the book was good because it was suspenseful and very very very very very very very very interesting
B009JBZH54|5.0|Why spend more for the 3 movies individually when you can get all three neatly packaged for less? Beats me.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I recommend this series to anyone. This series got me interested in mythology and history, plus they are good fast paced action adventure books. If you can't read slow books, try these. They are addicting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wasn't going to rate any products on here as I don't like the requirements, but I feel too strongly about this one to just let it slide on by.  It is a fantastic game for the platform.  Now, it is only in Alpha so there are a lot of elements of the PC Minecraft that are not implemented yet.  In reality though, that helps make this such a great time to buy it and start playing.  You have the opportunity to master some of the fundamentals while new features get added every 2-3 months.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have just started using this app but love it. SO many great ideas to find!! . Love the food section
B0086HGW42|5.0|This album is amazing! I had only heard the track The A Team before buying the album, but I've loved all of the songs! Ed is a really talented singer/songwriter. He can very from being very emotional and almost dark (Give Me Love) to happy and upbeat (Gold Rush and Lego House). Must have!!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|What can I say, Justin Hayward is best singer-songwriter.  The Moody Blue's have allways been a great band and have had so many great songs.  I think that this is Justin's best work yet!  I am still waiting for a mike Pinder, Ray Thomas, Graham Edge, John Lodge and of course Justin Hayward to get back together and make the greatest Moody Blues album ever.  All we can do is hope!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it's so fun I love to compete against my face book friends and family.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Give a idea of the weather in your area and what you need to get when you need to be prepared
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Inception had one of the best plots I had ever seen. Incredible! The cast was great and the acting oscar-worhty.
B004SBULWE|4.0|Tired of apps activating themselves and sucking all your battery life?  This guy can be set up to automatically stop apps or stop them upon your command.  I love him!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's awesome but it has it's flaws.<br />Like how the magnet times out almost every time you need it but it is so addictive I can't stop playing I am mad have to spend so much time writing this review because I can't play at the same time. Finch  didn't find th d be d find. H  check  nd she should  be :-/  Naples vs  bedsheets  vs  :-/  excuse that typing I have to have 20 words
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun and great updates. Not sure what more to say.  Get it you will enjoy it. A A A A A A A A A A
0765325950|5.0|I did not have any reservations with Brandon Sanderson taking over finishing this series off, and this book is proof that he has definitely honored Robert Jordan's memory. Extremely engrossing, and much easier to cruise through than the books near the beginning of the series due to how Brandon reconfigures the literary mood, still leaves a lot of Robert's accent around to make it feel legitimate. The battles are amazing, you can see it unfold in your head as you burn through the pages. The ending was very well put together, and definitely unexpected. I will be rereading this whole series again in the near future. Absolutely amazing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The writing in this book is amazing.  Maybe the best book I have ever read. You must read this book.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|I really shouldn't have to tell most parents how well these toys go through for your little ones. My child is 3 years old and he absolutely is addicted to angry birds. Suffice to say he got this for Christmas and I made the mistake of letting him open these gifts first, he pretty much didn't want to open anything else.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was a good story about the will to live and companionship.  Awesome book to take for a quick read on vacation.
1451695187|5.0|I bought this book for my son-in-law for his birthday as he had asked for it. I got it from Amazon as I do most<br />books... Then my daughter read it and told I must read it....Then I read it and from the first page I was hooked.<br />I believe in God and this book will a believer if your not sure.....His writing and the words are so interesting<br />you don't want to put the book down, but when you finish you will think about what he wrote and know the words are true,<br />as God is a wonder and he loves us all......I give this book a very good review. smile.\\"10\\".<br /><br />I got this book at Amazon's and most of my books come from Amazon.......
B0070XFNDE|3.0|Once the author wrote a great book, the name is shadow of the wind, an epic story that literature will observe as a great work of art. Then came book tow, angel's game and it was weaker and less interesting by comparison. And now this book which is by far the weakest one trying to cash on shadow of the wind. Mr. Zafon. It is time to leave shadow of the wind be and start a new epic. There is no more room of improvement left for a perfect story told.
0142000663|5.0|I read this book in high school many years ago and then donated it to our Library....It is a Classic.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|This was a really good book.  I learned a lot of things I did not know about the situation surrounding Dave's departure from Metallica.<br /><br />If you find yourself wondering what would have happened if Dave was still with Metallica?  There is a simple answer to this, \\"if Dave would have stayed,  there would have never been a Megadeth, and I think the music world is a much better place with them in it\\".<br /><br />Well done David!!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Speiburgs greatest movie and perhaps one of the best movies of all time! The black and white film just pushes this movie over the top, and Liam Neeson is unmatched in the emotion that he displays in playing the role!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This gift item actually came in a bit early.  My husband had wanted it for Christmas, but I saved it for Valentine's Day, instead.  Great Album, by the way.  He is enjoying it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site and its app! So many great ideas, recipes, pictures and more! As the title states I'm addicted!
B0087DFIOU|5.0|I like the story. Every since Lethal Weapon I have enjoyed watching Mel Gibson act and he is still one hell of an actor. Gibson makes you feel sorry for prison life while at the same time showing some of the reality of Mexican prisons.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|I liked this app at first, but soon found the movements hard to figure out and didn't enjoy the barriers to progress. Never could find my way out of the ice cave! Ho hum.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This enjoyable film hits all the standard plot turns.  It is a &#34;formula&#34; film, but when you do the formula right (which ain't easy, or everyone could do it), it usually turns out to be a successful film.  We might think of sweeping epics such as Lawrence of Arabia or The Godfather or Gandhi when we think of Oscar-winning films.  But a number of ordinary studio pictures have won the Oscar, pictures whose scope, style, and ambitions did not shout &#34;Oscar!&#34; when they went into production.  I think of Marty or The French Connection or Casablanca.  I can't recall a single a-unit exterior shot in all of Casablanca.  The picture was a potboiler melodrama, a Warner Bros assembly line film made entirely indoors at Burbank with a cast assembled at the last moment, and produced by craftsmen who were working at a pace we now associate with scripted TV production--weeks, not years.  But who would want to argue that Casablanca is a lesser film for any of that?  Not me.  I say Argo is in fine company.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This was probably designed for kids, but it brought out the &#34;artist&#34; in me. I found it to be easy to use, versatile, and a good way to pass the time. You'll be amazed at what you can come up with using the tools and colors. Great fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is awesome. It is really fun. I love it. I think you should get it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Never get tired of firing the birds at their targets. It's challenging without being frustrating. And you can always go back to a level and try to improve your score. AB Space is a bit harder but still fun. Get them all -- you'll see what I mean.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I thought Misremembered Man was well written and thought provoking.  It would be a read for a book club.  Christina McKenna portrayed the life of  this sad man like she personally knew him.
B000JML90Y|5.0|What else can we say about a masterpiece of the scientific modern thought? Just read it when you can. And enjoy it!
0689878451|5.0|Wonderful concept based on a great real life story. A great book for all parents to read to and familiarize their children with all the types of love that exists in today's society.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Fun game that makes you think. Good for kids and adults. Can't stop playing and trying to get all 3 stars.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|What more can I say..... It's Jason burner!  Fan of the entire series!  Wish they hadn't created the 4th DVD though.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|An incredible film with beautiful cinematography, design and costume. Keira Knightley is stunning. A very interesting take on Tolstoy and highly recommended.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Didn't expect much but didnt expect this.  Very dissapointed!  I'm a fan of mark warblers, and even the comedy aspect of this movie was not funny!  Sorry I rented it!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Lots of fun! A highly addictive way to pass the time on break or when you are waiting for your kids; just don't loose track if it! Then once you are able to master Temple run, dont forget to try Temple Run part 2&hellip;
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I am REALLY satisfied with my purchase of the AUDIO-TECHNICA ATR-3350 LAVALIER OMNIDIRECTIONAL CONDENSER MICROPHONE. I have used it quite successfully while filming my &#34;OUTDOORS WITH BUD&#34; program and I HIGHLY recommend it to others. As a matter of fact... I am SERIOUSLY considering purchasing another one.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|This edition is worthwhile if you are a collector, or must have each edition of a movie.it has extended scenes and 8 minutes of unseen footage.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park reminded me of the bright spots in those awkward high school years: the difference one true friend who understands you can make and how liberating it felt to fall in love with books, music, poetry, etc. The main characters are teens who stumble into a relationship that is tender and intense while their complicated family lives advance a plot with a truly surprise ending. (I challenge anyone to say they saw it coming.) Rainbow creates such lovely characters, even the minor ones are funny and memorable. I was immediately invested in Eleanor and Park's lives, and once that happened, I couldn't devour the book fast enough. Now, I can't wait to share it with all of the readers in my life.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This my favorite spider solitaire. I have played this game from many different companies but none are as good as this one in my opinion. Try it this Solitaire out and I am sure you will agree.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. Continues right along after Season 2, with the introduction of some new and intriguing characters. The new characters as well as the new setting really enhances everything the show is about in that each is a foil respectively. Highly recommend this!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such an awesome game! It has such cool detail and you never want to stop playing it!!!!I recommend this game to anyone anywhere anytime!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved Safe Haven! It was such a great book. I laughed, cried and overall enjoyed the book. Nicholas Sparks is a great author and I absolutely love his books!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Now, the time has arrived. If you were waiting for a clean decent show to watch then this is it without a doubt. Downton Abby has given me my TV entertainment back. It's the best show on tv, not a boring minute. Please watch this show, I have told everybody I know about this show and they're hooked. It's mature, no nonsense and darn good entertainment. I envy all first timers to this show. I've learned UK version is uncut. PBS airs this wonderful show on Sundays but you can also see it on Netflix and IMDb(has UK version uncut).
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Easy reading with an unexpected ending!  Some of the book was a little hard to read because of the gory descriptions.  But overall a really good read!
B0011FYJYG|2.0|I was disappointed with the quality of the DVD. Both the audio and the video were uneven. The sound went low on the dialogue and very loud on the music. The color was blotchy in spots, such as the red lipsticks and other bright colors. Definitely not a HD product. The handling and delivery etc., on the other hand, was very good.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|this was a really sweet twist on the Frankenstein story. My son and I really enjoyed watching this one. I think anyone who watches this will love it.
0321811984|1.0|I have \\"PresentationZen\\" in a Portuguese edition. The price? Around US$ 50!<br /><br />But guess what? It was the WORST translation I've ever seen of a book on a professional subject. I think the book is great, but the Portuguese/Brazilian publisher didn't hear what is excelence in edition.<br /><br />The text has unbelievable copydesk and textual mistakes. I complained about and they advocated who made the textual revision. They practice an unforgivable sin: pride for a poor, neglected and miserable textual quality!<br /><br />My question then is, WHAT REVISION? WHAT PROOFREAD?<br /><br />I tried to contact Garr Reynolds and the Publisher, with no answer. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't matter for them.<br /><br />Sorry! Very sorry!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This is the second time that I have read the book.  I have over three thousand books in my personal library and &#34;The Compound Effect&#34; has just moved up there with &#34;Think an Grow Rich&#34; and &#34;The Power of Positive Thinking&#34;.  It is destined to be a classic.
B0099Y2YL6|2.0|This is a great series that's taken the world by storm. Excellent acting, superior dress and sets.<br />It was hard losing Sybil, but this year the show loses one of it's main characters. As popular and excellent as this show is, I'm not sure if the series is still following the book. The second major kill-off was because the actor wanted to leave the series.  I went around two days moping because of that lol.<br /><br />I would like to mention that I hope someone else speaks up if they're having problems with the Blu-Ray UK version.<br />The first two shipments from Amazon, disk 1 didn't work but disk 2 and 3 did.<br />The last shipment, all three disks didn't work in our player. We have a large Blu Ray collection and they all play fine. I might also mention I tried a second machine and it didn't work in that one too.<br /><br />On the second set, I called in and had the misfortune of having to talk to someone from India who spoke pigeon English. When I explained to her what happened, she asked me to describe my DVD player and give her the model number! Then she said there would be an \\"investigation\\" into the claims I made of the faulty disks. My God! I am not trying to steal anything I want working disks! Then she read that the DVDs are for region 1/A for North America, and asked me if United States was in North America.<br /><br />Luckily, I used the automated online return/replace form and Amazon graciously sent out the third set. Sadly, also defective. We are now going to buy from Walmart or PBS because we know it will be a different batch of prints. We have been loyal Amazon buyers since 2000 but three times is enough.<br /><br />The show still has all the charm, class, and tear jerking moments of the first, I heartily recommend everyone to watch the series. It will teach us Americans a bit about how to conduct oneself in a civilized and courteous fashion. Excellent series.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was an excellent movie, very similar to the book.  It had outstanding performances and really gave you a picture of what living in the segregated South must have been like.  I t pictures life from the view points of both the white Southern world and the African-American.  It touches on prejudices and child abuse, pride in oneself, accusations of wrongdoing, and kindness.  I recommend it highly.
B008B92U32|3.0|it was a funny app.  easy to learn and easy to use.  i thought this was so much fun, i will keep it and use it for facebook incorporation.
0525953728|5.0|Many of the other reviewers have captured the admiration I feel for \\"Mark Owen\\" and the rest of Seal Team 6. Obama and Biden can posture but these were the people who did the job of killing Bin Laden. While not discussed in the book, it was the torture techniques that culled the information about OBL's courier from KSM and other terrorists.<br /><br />It also occurred to me while reading this book that we have people like Owen doing the work to keep us safe so that fops in NY, LA and SF can drink their cafe lattes in peace. It would be nice if such people, at least every now and then, would say 'thank you'.<br /><br />Finally, I was left to wonder how one follows up a decade as a SEAL and the killing of OBL. Can one be a salesman after that?
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Great movie for Hitchcock fans especially. Anthony Hopkins was amazing! Everyone's portrayal of the original cast was enjoyable to watch.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is perfect for my Kindle Fire and I will look into the paid version next.  That's about all. today
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Just like many of the pendergast novels, this grabbed my attention and i could not stop reading it til the end.  This book and its predecessor seemed to focus more on pendergast rather than other characters, so it seemed a little unusual, as did the clear signs of weakness/frailty on his part.  Still it was a great read!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Good book. Unexpected turns. Good ending. Sad truth about the Catholic convents and abuses by people you would think are godly.
B006Z00R1Q|5.0|Any movie that makes me jump out of my chair is awesome to me and this movie did that.  If you are a paranormal activity fan then this movie is for you
B009ZTLPJM|4.0|I have nearly every Soundgarden album, I didn't jump on this one after hearing a song on the radio.  It wasn't until I listened to nearly the whole album online that I warmed up to it and bought it.  Lately I've just left the album on repeat, it's pretty damn good.  The flavor of it reaches across the last three or four albums.<br /><br />I can't wait until they come out with another!
B000PY6BBI|1.0|Don't waste your money.  Boring right from the start and continued.  No plot, no suspense, a B movie at best.
B006LSZECO|4.0|For me the book didn't get good until mid-point. There were many twists & turns but I was disappointed with the ending.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|for everyone who loved Indiana Jones, (who doesn't) this is the one to have.  It took forever to be released on blu ray, but worth the wait...
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This DVD was another in the line of successful dramas from Denzel Washington.  It was good but somewhat predictable.  Performance was sensational.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|Not many watches attract this much attention.<br />But this one does and admirers by the dozen. The blue background lets the watch hands literally jump off your wrist and telling time is a breeze. The chronographs are quick and accurate and reset easily. You will enjoy this INVICTA watch for years. And while I am right handed I find using my left hand for the chrono functions is so much easier that I have bought more.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|phenominal musicianship. miles, chick corea everybody is on top of their game. amazing that this lineup never played on a record together.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Got this for my 6 month old. Turns out my husband and I love it just as much as she does. Thanks!
1599290634|5.0|Gets better and better every year and love the fact they add teh medium and size for most- also love they have sculptures as well
B00622B3MY|5.0|Got this for my 6 month old. Turns out my husband and I love it just as much as she does. Thanks!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Very absorbing story, although I was sometimes unwilling to leave one narrative to tackle another. The birthmark part was a little too obscure.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Got this for my 6 month old. Turns out my husband and I love it just as much as she does. Thanks!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|It was entertaining and Tina Fey is probably a person I would enjoy talking to, but her book seemed a little too much like navel-gazing and wasn't as funny as I wanted it to be.
1575666286|5.0|This is a very detailed book, that includes supplements as well as recipes for health and healing.  Very well written and easy to understand.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Ok... I'm 42, but listen to a lot of the cool stuff that my kids like. the first time I heard Some Nights on the radio I fell in love and bought the album... Heck, I had to google &#34;what do I stand for&#34; to find the song name and band name at that time. There's one song that I don't like, they were just trying something new I think, and one that makes me think of Bohemian Rhapsody in it's style. The rest is just really good... My 14 and 21 year old daughters keep stealing the disk.
B007N85POS|5.0|This is another beautiful angry birds game.<br />The game play is smooth and does not seem to heat up the cpu like some of the other Angry birds games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awsome. I bought it when it was number 1 and to me its still number 1. this game is fun for all ages and the update is amazing
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a marriage saver book!  A must read for all married couples.  This book has put my marriage at a better place.  This could help you too!
B008HJGPVO|4.0|The pen had 3 tips. The soft type needed for the IPAD. It really needed a smaller tip to take notes during classes. So far it seems to do the job. The extra tips are nice for artistic projects.
B0042XA2U4|1.0|So I bought this book last week hoping to see if it was anything like the movie that I fell in love with. To say I was highly disappointed would be an understatement I didn't even finish the book. I got to maybe chapter 3 before I gave up on reading. Which isn't very much like me because I usually always finish the book but as I was reading this is just so obtuse so far from what I was expecting. If you read the book first, Then you might be able to enjoy it but if you're a person like me who saw the movie and fell in love with it I wouldn't even bother picking up the book you're just going to aggravate yourself.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|This is an excellent album and will stand with Nick Cave's best.<br />His evolving art sees a changed communication in music and lyric.<br />Here he reaches for the speech that's trying to be heard,<br />whether scattered words evoking soft cinematic imagery,<br />impressionistic poetic phrases, or grand scale metaphor;<br />but straight narrative has gone.<br /><br />While there is none of Nick's bump and grind routine,<br />be assured that this is not pastoral Cave, it is rock in the sense of disquiet,<br />the tension, the background technica created by collaborating Seeds' composer Warren Ellis, the Seeds themselves and Nick's voice. Some is spoken and half sung but it all has resonance and conviction, in fact Nick inhabits the voices superbly throughout, or they inhabit him (O Mamma!!)... His singing is better than ever and projected so well by producer Nick Launay.<br /><br />For me there is not a dud track among the nine. Some will attract you on first listen, listen further, this has depth. Some faves for me - Water's Edge in minor key with violin playing a timeless Eastern motif and pulsating bass supporting this tale of the currency of communication, the shoreline mating ritual at Brighton transplanted maybe from NE Victoria, from the small town Book of Love.<br /><br />Mermaids has a wonderful dreamy chorus with watery ambient sounds and lyrics about desire, women with closed legs - 'I do husband/driver/mermaid alertness course', Cave's black humour flares in spots throughout the album.<br /><br />We Real Cool with its reverb pulsating bass, great vocal, spacey ambiance.  Finishing Jubilee Street with its clacking clapping percussion and its insistent bell, like a railway warning bell in country Oz.  The Higgs Boson Blues, using again the disquieting minor key, is the album's opus with Nick in a cracked voice tale 'Been sitting in my basement patio/it was hot/up above the girls walk past/their roses all in bloom'. O Mamma, I'll turn to stone! And his humour again 'And if I die tonight/bury me in my favourite yellow patent leather shoes/with a mummified cat and a cone-like hat/that the Caliphate forced on the Jews'. Ah yes, what does it all mean? Some verses may appear to be throwaway but it's the sound and the mood they attempt to convey, an added flippancy, offhandedness perhaps but the final verse sums it all up. Or is the song just a grand metaphor for Nick's approaching dental appointment, like Dylan's Watchtower? Mmmm?<br /><br />The title song is a wonderful mood summary for the album 'And some people say it is just rock 'n roll/Oh but it gets right down to your soul'. Nick Launay's tasteful production is excellent, the booklet has lyrics, track info and photos - Nick's naked wife Susie on the great cover - is he letting the goddamn light shame her temporal beauty? Or is he showing her the way out? This is a temporal elemental album pushing the sky away. Maybe. Your reading might differ. That's what makes it so good. Fabulous stuff - keep on pushing Nick.ur again 'And if I die tonight/bury me in my favourite yellow patent leather shoes/with a mummified cat and a cone-like hat/that the Caliphate forced on the Jews'.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love Downton Abbey! This is one of the best series I have ever watched. If you love this time period, you will love this show.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|This game board does work and it does offer a lot of programmable buttons. Although you have to have large hands to reach some of them.<br />I noticed that some of the buttons are &#34;sticking&#34; when pressing them. Button G20 (lower left button), when pressing with your pinky, does not depress smoothly because my pinky hits the very edge of the button. Its more like button placement than anything. If they moved that key over to the left a bit more or made it longer, that'd be nice.<br />The thumb button near the &#34;joystick&#34; are not responsive enough. A few times I have had to press it more than once to activate the button. Maybe its because its new and the button has not &#34;soften&#34; up yet. I programmed it to something I rarely use so it isnt too bad.<br /><br />The &#34;joystick&#34; is a good add on, but its not easy to use when gaming. it'll take some time to get used that stick while doing movements with the &#34;WASD&#34; keys. Its leaps and bounds better than the Razer Nostromo's joystick thats for sure. I returned the Nostromo due to lack of buttons, terrible joystick/thumb area and the constant sliding of the keypad during gaming. The Nostromo did have slightly better button placement. Meaning the keys were easier to press and each row of buttons was angled to make it easier to press.<br /><br />Razer has created the Orbweaver which has more buttons and adjustable wrist/thumb area. I wonder if they fixed the joystick and the sliding issue?
B000SEJHRA|3.0|Will make you say \\"this guy is weird\\", but not before a few good laughs. Read when you require some smiles and frowns.
0399157565|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed this book. I hadn't read any of Patricia Cornwell's novels in a few years, because they became very predictable - I found it difficult to remember which books I had already read, because they were so similar. The Bone Bed was pretty good - it introduced some interesting new characters (new to me anyway!), and she crafted a compelling story (although I would have preferred more depth in the characters).  My number one criticism of this book were the numerous references to Apple products (\\"I checked my iPhone; I opened my Mac laptop etc\\") throughout the book.  It was painfully obvious that Ms Cornwell is being paid by Apple to endorse their products (which is a bit tasteless in my opinion and not at all subtle) - either that, or she's trying to attract/impress a younger audience.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have the full series and remember one of my first dates with my husband was with Dr. No. We've been married 48 years this year, so you can be sure I have all the Bond men..I love the way they have changed the reality of this..it could be real. But then,<br />as a fan of this character, it's always been an awesome way to escape and see the good guys win. Love Daniel Craig. Totally different..from the norm. Judy Dench was a superb touch to the Bond series..will miss her..she truly is quite the lady.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great characters and lot of twists. No gimme  here. One of Baldacci's better stories set in Washington D.C. The Professor recommends it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|In my opinion this has better scrolling response and controllablity over LogMeIn that I prefer. For my money this is a winner.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Much easier to follow in this format.  Thirteen words are required for the review to count.  Four more required. done.
B000MV9026|5.0|Watching this made us all want to dance.  Very cute story and adorable penguins.  Saw it at the theater when it first came out; but would definitely watch it again and again with grandkids.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I'm not sure what I thought this would be about, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not always a nice read, but it's honest and that's what matters.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Clever and light, especially the dialogue, like the TV show.  That's the reason I read it, I love the show.  Surprised that there really were books by Richard Castle (undoubtedly a nom de plume).  Good at setting up situations and solving them with aplomb and theatre.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It's a suspenful movie. When it's non-fiction n actually happened It's more interesting, but sbouldn't they have casted someone more resembling Mr. Mendez? Mr. Ben Afleck is tall n good looking. Mr. Mendez looks like a regular Joe n barely reaches Mr Afleck's broad shoulder's. Othere than that it's a good movie, if it weren't for all the cursing it would b a very good movie. That's my personal opinion.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Wounderful take on super hero desires one has to make a difference.  Story is engaging with lots of imaginative subtext. Bottomline, its funny and engaging with the addition of a believable young female super hero,
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game and it is so addicting to!! my 8 year old Granddaughter loves this game also!! had to fight for my kindle when she is here.
B00008CLOA|5.0|If you have a very good system, this may be worth investing in. I feel that the surround effects are well-mastered and don't sound contrived, and the added resolution of the format allowed me to hear details (especially low frequency) that I had never heard before. Highly recommended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard a lot about Downton Abbey, but didn't want to begin watching Season3 on TV without seeing previous episodes. So, I was so happy to be able to watch all of the previous episodes on my computer using AMAZON Prime.<br />I really enjoy this series, Downton Abbey, Seasons 1-3, and think this PBS HD Video series would be a great gift for someone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome I always play this game. I can't wait to see what you get in the eggs
1609611543|5.0|I loved this book.  It was an easy read backed up with believable research.  My husband & I are wheat-free for 2 months now.  We are amazed at how much better we feel:  fewer joint aches, no bloated feeling after eating, significantly fewer cravings, improved diet of healthful foods, increased alertness, & yes-weight loss.  I only wish we had this info decades ago.  I highly recommend this book & life style to those who are addicted to harmful carbs.
B008ENA74E|3.0|Well done.<br />In my opinion, Goldman Sachs has wormed it's way into the government, and just like any other parasite,feeds on it's willing host to know one's benefit other than it's own.
B00992CF6W|4.0|LOVE IT it just doesn't seem to have the minecraft soundtrack I mean it is VERY addicting but fun you can play it for 5 minutes and you'll love it.The zombies can get annoying but still cool.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|I started reading this I said because I saw the movie was coming out. After the first book I was like \\"eh\\", but somewhat curious what happened next. This book, by the end I just couldn't wait for it to be over. And the ending, more of the same. Eighteen moons, seriously? Over it. And over Ethan's whiny, incessantly clingy inner monologue. Now, I am a lover of series, and it takes a LOT for me to not finish one, but...yeah. Won't be reading any more of these.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed the story line very much! The past of the characters and how it encompassed there daily lives. The way there chemistry created a love so strong they together worked through there past to better there future.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am totally addicted to this game! I love the missions and I love that I can play it and my kids (9yrs, 7yrs & 5yrs old) can also play it without messing up my game! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because even though I am signed in through Facebook on my phone and also on my kindle fire,the games are not synced. Also to get the update from \\"Rio\\" to \\"Rome\\" on my kindle fire I had to uninstall the game so I lost everything I spent my coins on =( and start completely over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how the game changes themes every once in a while and I love how it is like Temple Run but easier.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|This book is amazing and is perfect for someone with a taste for a book of dragons and adventure. Although towards the end it gets really sad, it ends well and I could not imagine a better ending for this book. Hope you enjoy it as much as I had the last four times!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series, the acting is very good and I love British history.  Can't wait for new season to start.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Arnold's first movie is probably still his best. Though this is essentially a \\"docu-drama\\" (it was instilled with some provocative, fictional elements, in order to make it more interesting), it still provides a fascinating look at one of America's most well known figures, while he was at the height of his bodybuilding career. Watching \\"Pumping Iron\\", it's easy to see how Arnold came to achieve such wealth and fame. His charisma is infectious, and nearly impossible to ignore. Likewise, his confidence is absolute and unshakable, and it's interesting to see how clearly he foresees his future success (and how accurate this vision came to be).<br /><br />What is equally interesting is that Arnold's flaws are also subtly revealed, in this probing look into his early years in America. Though he does have incredibly charisma and confidence, they come at a price- they also instill him with a sense of invincibility and entitlement. These flaws would eventually catch up with him, leading to his \\"downfall\\" (a lackluster political career, the exposure of his mistress and love child, his wife leaving him, and the decreased interest in his films). It's remarkable to see how much of this man's life and career is foreshadowed in \\"Pumping Iron\\", a movie that was filmed 35 years ago.
B009LHWFLU|5.0|This show is awesome.  The characters are great.  The writing is great.  I think the thing I like the most is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, and never seems afraid of a little twisted self-referential humour.  Also, Dean/Castiel 4EVER.
1569242739|5.0|Has tons of easy recipes that are really easy to make. I like that they don't use alot of soy products either like many vegan recipes tend to!
B00BLGZN1S|4.0|If you're looking for an entertaining story line, a good war story, lots of action, bravery, friendship and intrigue, then you'll enjoy this movie.  The acting was good, the story line kept moving and the good guys were good and the bad guys were bad!  It may not be historically accurate, but if we wanted that, we'd have watched something from the History Channel :o)
160094048X|5.0|I've never met a cookie I didn't like!!  Vegan cookies are not always that good though. However, every recipe in this book I tried, I liked. Super easy too!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This story line and graphics hooked me right away.  I need to get back to the game, I have hero work to do!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My husband bought this but it has since been deleted. We bought a touch screen computer and he wanted to try it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|They took my favorite game and made it even better. Now I can waste even more time playing!  ;-) Seriously, I love all the extra tile configurations, and I love replaying them to improve my &quot;personal best&quot; time.
B001NCM98U|5.0|Listen to it.<br />Enjoy it.<br />This band is always lovely to hear. Just put the album on and let it play through. You'll see what I mean.
0375851569|5.0|The books arrived ahead of schedule and are exactly as specified. I'm very happy with my purchase. I can't wait to use these at our Dr. Seuss themed shower.
B00881VLCE|4.0|There is a proplem.  If you play at the easy level you oon't have acces to all the pieces to finish the puzzle.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I was having a hard time getting the kinect to see me because of the small size of my room.<br />(I live in a mobile home)<br />You just snap this thing over the lens of Your kinect and it cuts the distance You need to be from the lens in half.<br />Now I can stand 5 or 6 feet from the kinect and it can track me just fine.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this is not one of those corny hidden picture games. it has an actual storyline, great game play, and it's right on as far as difficulty goes. highly recommended.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game that works your brain. Awesomeness. Lol. Best game ever :) ;)<br />10 out of 10. Play it over and over.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think this show is a wonderfully crafted sociological drama - well written and well acted!!  Plus we'll know how to deal with those pesky zombies when needed!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is my second go at reading these books! I can read them over and over. I love the fact that it has both a darkness to it and a love story ending it. However, my favorite part is how well it was written, especially the vocabulary used. I like reading words that make me think ( and have to look at them in the dictionary). It has to be one of my favorite books so far, and hopes she continues down this genre!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a very fun game that makes me want to play nonstop for hours!! It's a lot like temple run, but unique enough that I highly recommend having both games. You can even sign in with facebook and get competitive with your friends! GREAT app!! :D
B00001QGPS|5.0|Before this album, both Redman and Method Man were known for their larger than life personalities. Redman was known for his off the wall/eccentric style and Method Man was known as one of the strongest lyricists and MC's of the Wu-Tang Clan. With both teamed up here, the chemistry between the 2 is amazing.<br />Both of them seem to be in their element even more than usual and they sometimes even play off each others strengths.<br /><br />Redman is fierce and on top of his game and spits out some quirky rhymes along with some really powerful ones. Method Man is at his A-Game with extremely strong delivery and some powerful words to go along with it. These 2 compliment each other perfectly.<br />The guests they had on the tracks were hit and miss; LL Cool J, Ghostface Killah, Ja Rule, Streetlife and Blue Rasberry all enhanced the songs they were on but Mally G and Young Zee didn't help the song they were on that much (and the song could've been better with no guests at all).<br /><br />The production by Erick Sermon, RZA, Mathematics, and pretty much everyone on the album is great. The beats and music almost always are inventive and fresh. The only 2 tracks that didn't do much for me on here were \\"Where We At\\" and \\"Maaaad Crew\\".<br /><br />Other than that, this album is definitely a hip hop classic and belongs in any rap fan's collection.<br /><br />If you like Redman, buy this now.<br />If you like Method Man, buy this now.<br />If you like Wu-Tang, buy this now!<br /><br />Just buy it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that subway surfers is a very good game it is probably one<br />Of my favorite games but the problem is once in a wile it glitches<br />On me. I'm not saying anything bad about it like I said I love it.<br />It doesn't glitch on me all the time probably once every other day.<br />I would really recommend this app if you get it there is a 99% chance<br />That you will love it so all in all get it
B009EEFTMC|5.0|What a challenge each time.  Love this game and can't get enough time playing it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, really of any age.  Great for us &#34;old folks&#34;.
030758836X|5.0|Devoured this book during a beach weekend.  HIghly recommended from a friend, and I have also passed this novel along to others ... who have equally enjoyed this book. A+++
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|It's so frustrating to have to wait for the rest of the series.  I had thought the five books was the entire series only to realize upon starting the fifth book, there were going to be two more.  I was very impressed that the TV series was so honest to the written word and I enjoyed it very much.
0380730405|5.0|An oldie but goodie.  Written by the same, extraordinarly talented author of &#34;The Birds.&#34;  Exquisite details in this book and I would highly recommend this read.  Have passed this on to others ... and they feel the same way...
B009AMANH4|1.0|Steven Spielberg has made hands down one of the years most boring films with his awards contender Lincoln. The film, which chronicles the passing of the 13th amendment to the constitution, where Lincoln and constituents freed the slaves, has about as much drama as paint drying. This is a shame, particularly considering the multitude of acting talent that is present for the film, including the sterling lead Daniel Day-Lewis. His Lincoln is unfortunately a reserved, understated gentle man whose convictions manifest themselves in one of thousands of diatribes throughout the picture.<br /><br />Did I say diatribes? Yes, this film is almost entirely made up of scenes of Lincoln talking to those about the slavery issue with requisite arguing back and forth. Scenes go from the white house to the courtroom to the senate and house floor and on and on and on. No fewer than four different people were heard audibly snoring during the film for a reason. The film has a serious tone and one stamped by a continuous score that tells the audience how we should feel during each scene. A stirring speech about why there shouldn't be slavery is given, set to the appropriate orchestral backdrop, repeat ad nauseum. Goodness.<br /><br />Lincoln did an amazing thing by freeing the slaves. He did the right thing, the constitutional thing and the difficult thing, particularly given the times and opposition he faced. What the audience unfortunately faces in Spielberg's picture is one that should have been made for the history channel, not on a large screen in a medium far underused for the purposes of this piece. Virtually no scope is to be found in Spielberg's direction that made this worthy of being a big screen endeavor. The largeness of the ideas at play are ruined by the smallness of his film. It's remarkable if not entirely predictable.<br /><br />Spielberg has done this sort of thing before, with Amistad and Schindler's List coming immediately to mind. The films don't allow for the viewer to experience any feeling on their own as the themes and strings hammer home the point for you. Spielberg's film should not be an Oscar contender in many instances (save for costume or set design and DDL's performance) and the way he has made it, should not have been made for the silver screen. Viewers are left to shake their heads at this missed opportunity.<br /><br />Note: This review is for the film and not the Blu-Ray's features and presentation itself.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|I picked this movie to go to sleep by one evening.  I couldn't stop watching and fall to sleep.  The acting was real, human, and earthy.  It was well written, entertaining and poignant.  The actor who played the subject of the story (true by the way) kept my interest.  He portrayed the young man he played as a thoughtful, dynamic, smart individual.  He played his demons well too.<br />The cinematography is beautiful.  I recommend this movie to any young wanderer who wants to prove him or herself and to all who are smart enough to stay home to mend their fences in a more traditional way.<br />There is one love scene, and one hunting scene that may have given it the R rating. I find that unfortunate  because the love scene leant nothing to the story.  The hunting scene was integral.  If not for the R rating it could have been a good movie to take your adolescents to.  Many family dynamics are portrayed and it could have been seen by a wider audience.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I loved this book .Could not put it down. The characters are well written, story line is exciting, loved the main character and can't wait till the next book comes out..
B000O8OTNC|4.0|If you're on the run, at work and lost your edge(s) or you just need your blades sharpened in a pinch, this works. However, don't consider it a replacement for a good sharpening stone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer soooo much and I try to play it as much as I can.thanks for making the best game every.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|While there are some slight faults with the movie, overall it is a great documentary to show where America really is at with food...and it is eye-opening.  We are what we eat, and where the food industry is at today cannot be ignored with where health is nationwide as well.<br /><br />Some might struggle through parts of the movie that show animal cruelty, but people need to be enlightened to what is going on.<br /><br />Finally, what I live about this movie is there is hope.  There are a ton of doom and gloom documentaries out there that leave you with a sense of hopelessness, by we consumers have the power.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wonderful option to have if you don't have cable. And the price is equal or cheaper than renting a movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You will fall in love with this game it's so fun and addicting you won't want to stop playing it.
1595825045|5.0|A wonderful book full of art and direction, a nice guide on what it takes to make a cartoon, And worth the price.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I liked this book so much that I bought several copies to give to family and friends! Susan makes her points well and gives the reader much to consider about how out of balance our very extraverted our culture is generally, as well as in specific settings.
B004XISI4A|3.0|It is gettng very complicated to follow the story. There are to many characters, and for a lot of them you get their background, ancestors etc, that causes one to miss focus on the story.<br />The novel is divided into a lot of chapters where you follow one of the characters, and every time it starts to get interesting the chapter ends and the story switches to another character. It is very annoying, especially when new characters pop up frequently. The story is much to detailed, in my opinion the book could easily have been half as long and still cover the story with the necessary details.<br />The author uses far to much details on characters and background that only cause one to loose interest.<br />I think one other reviewer wrote that this is a novel in search of a story, and I agree.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Another amazing Passion Pit album, exactly what I expected. Got it for only $2 so it was a steal. Excellent
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun and it is a great way to pass time when your waiting for something to happen.the game always keeps the little ones quiet when you need them to be.
B007L5GDGW|3.0|The game has good graphics, and while the tilting is difficult at first, with some experience and a steady hand it's pretty responsive. Gameplay focuses on keeping your marble on platforms, tilting to the right and left and focusing on not over tilting and driving your marble into outer space. Both the platforms and universe look good and the music is relaxing, but repetitive. There are 3 different courses, and the main difference is each have obstacles placed in different positions on each.<br /><br />The game suffers from a lack of game modes. It's the same thing over and over. A lack of game modes and a lack of mini games really eliminates potential replay value for the game. It's a very basic and plain game, and while that works well for a free app, I can't recommend paying for a lack of features. No settings, and it's pretty bad that there isn't even a leaderboard/tracker of how far you've went like there is on Doodle Jump/Temple Run.<br />(Kindle Fire HD)

B006OEPITO|5.0|This is one of those books that I begrudgingly read, when assigned in school, but have returned to for multiple reads. I'm really very fond of it.<br />I am really very confused at the several comments that say it's too long of a read. It's a pretty short book and pretty easy to pick up and put down, with a pretty simple story that contains a complicated premise. It's Hesse's retelling of the Buddha tale and Sidharta's coming to enlightenment, but does not stick to the original scripture, diverging for a more compelling read.<br />As I said, I enjoyed it quite a lot.
B008M721MS|3.0|Good however I love it very much and would like more apps for my device hope you understand me clear

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book reminded me a bit of a David Gemmel novel, with fantastic action and adventure.  But the world that Ryan created is even more complex, and the story is set up wonderfully.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Way Better than Temple run<br /><br />Subway surfers is the best game I have ever played. The only problem is it sometimes resets. But that is not a problem to me;you just have to go to the main screen and click on the game again. But otherwise it is awesome.
B00BHMEALA|3.0|Lately, most Best Picture winners don't live up to the award and 'Argo' is yet another film to make that list.<br /><br />I have to begin by saying that I really appreciated all of the detail paid to the storyboard process.  As a top-of-the-line, bona fide, USDA Certified, Grade A STUD storyboard artist myself, it was nice to see that we have the power to pre-visualize productions AND save lives in the process.  That's a what an artist at the pinnacle of his/her profession can do.<br /><br />It was just disappointing that the Hollywood Hotshots who made this film didn't contact me for the actual boards because I have been involved with some of the greatest ad campaigns and feature films that have graced your VISIO flatscreen and the big screens at the cineplex picture show.  Perhaps you've heard of the Dell kid who always ended the commercials with 'Dude, you're getting a Dell' (prior to his arrest and banishment from the industry after marijuana possession, anyway)?  Maybe you've seen some Cialis commercials where the older couples end up knockin' the boots and end up in separate bathtubs in a exotic location?  'Corky Romano', anybody?  All blockbusters and all pretty much successful due to me.<br /><br />Let's just say the Producers  (Benjamin Afflent, George Cooney and that squirly sidekick to Schwarzenegger and Thomas Arnold in 'True Lies') dropped the ball by not hiring me.<br /><br />Anywho, I think the getaway sequence in this film ruined it overall for me.  Even if it is the early 1980's, instead of running through an entire airport, there are communication devices called telephones where one party can contact another party to overt, I don't know, a plane from taking off.  I mean, just call the air traffic control tower and ground Swiss Air from taking off as opposed to running miles and miles, breaking locked doors and ripping through fences to get down to jetway.  I was surprised the Iranians even used cars to chase after the 747 as it began to taxi because they are depicted as such incompetents that you would think they would chase after them on camels.<br /><br />I liked that Marissa's dad from 'The OC' was in it.  Great, great show and sorely missed to these keen eyes, let me tell you.<br /><br />Not a bad movie.  Worth watching but too much focus on the bizarre 'plan' to rescue these guys and not enough actual rescue.  Plus, we know how it ends, anyway...so how much 'on the edge of my seat' could I get.e they are depicted as such incompetents that you would think they would chase after them on camels.<br /><br />I liked that Marissa's dad from 'The OC' was in it.

B002ZG98FU|4.0|It's not heavy, deep, or even all that moving, but it's fun and enjoyable nonetheless.  A young producer (Rachel McAdams) is laid off from one show and manages to get hired on as executive producer of another dying show \\"Daybreak\\". Her tireless drive and enthusiasm finally turns the show around despite the cynicism of a cantankerous old news anchor (Harrison Ford), just in time for her to have to make a fateful decision as to her own future.<br /><br />It's possible to dissect this movie into tiny little bits, but others have long since done that. I'm just going to say, it's great light entertainment on a lonely evening and I recommend it thoroughly.

1475972350|5.0|When Stephen Bjornson wakes up drowsy and unable to move, he knows something is terribly wrong, but the nightmare has only just begun... Soon his family are dead and Rockton Illinois has a killer on the loose.<br /><br />Detective Max Larkin works alone, so he’s not impressed when he is teamed up with rookie detective and local girl Jesse Fairlane. However, before long a strong partnership develops as they try to capture the grizzly murderer.<br /><br />The motive quickly becomes apparent, the victims have wasted the murderer’s time and he doesn’t like time wasters! Confirmation of this is written in their blood at the crime scenes, but he never makes a mistake and leaves no clues.<br /><br />As the death toll rises, the young detectives discover the murderer has struck before, and their partnerships tested in unimaginable ways as they try to find a lead.<br /><br />Will they discover who the serial killer is?<br /><br />Why does time wasting anger him so?<br /><br />I couldn’t put this book down, and would thoroughly recommend it. The storyline is brilliant and there are some great twists.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Anyone who watched the 2013 Academy Awards got a taste of the great music they are missing by not watching the movie. Just as the medley was sung live at the ceremonies, the vocals were all filmed live for the movie. As close as one can come to a live stage performance of one of the great musicals of all time!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Nice police procedural twist and turn. Kept you interested. Rare in today's Horror films. Looking forward to the sequel. More Boogie Man
0142410314|5.0|I'm giving this to my nephew now that I read it. I grew up with the movie and never read the book. Love the movie. Love the book now too. It's a fun, quick read.<br /><br />It's interesting how the oompa loompas are depicted -- nothing like the movie, and the songs are different than the movie too. There are other things that differ from the movie, probably because they didn't translate to film very well--things that require imagination are sometimes difficult in a pre-CGI world or would have been too costly. The story line is slightly different in that there is no bad guy which slightly changes the ending.<br /><br />Wish I read this as a kid!
B0081336FO|4.0|Truly the British resurrection of Sherlock Holmes. It is well shot, well acted, well written. The mysteries are interesting. I actually like the movie like length. Can not wait till the 3rd season appears (being shot spring 2013)

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I went to go see this movie at the midnight premiere, waiting all day for it. Ever since I heard that the Hobbit was coming to the big screen I have been so excited for this film to finally arrive. And boy was it worth the wait!!!<br /><br />At first, Peter Jackson announced that the Hobbit would be spit into two films, An Unexpected Journey and There and Back Again. I thought this was all fine and dandy, and that the movies would be great. Then I heard that the Hobbit would be split into THREE films. Another trilogy! Really! We dont need another one of those! My main reason to say this was that I thought that there was not enough material in the Hobbit for three films to be done.<br /><br />But then December 13, 11:59 pm arrived, and man oh man, did my opinion on Jacksons decision change! After watching the Hobbit, part 1, seeing how that first film was done, i believe that there is by far enough material to cover three movies. and then some, most likely!<br /><br />My favorite parts about this film are, 1, Erebor. The Dwarf Kingdom Under the Mountain was superbly done. Absolutly fantastic to watch! Eyegasm! Moria from the Fellowship was amazing, but it was in ruins. Erebor was not, and boy do I admire Tolkiens Dwarves that much more! 2, the whole Goblin sequence. This includes Goblin Town, the Goblin King, and the Dwarves and Gandalfs flight from the creatures. That part was fantastically done. In the book it describes Goblin Town as a system of tunnels and caverns. In the movie it is really a massive cavern under the Misty Mountains, with alot of wooden bridges and such spanning it in a town-type of fashion. I thought that it brought out the Goblins even more then they themselves already did. And the Goblin King was great! Cant remember the actors name, I think its Barry something-or-other, but he did a superb job. Scrotum Beard! 3, The Troll Sequence. The Trolls were great, hands down to those actors. These trolls are very differend than the ones found in Rings(they do look similar to the troll we saw in Moria). Their dialogue was awesome, and when Gandalf turns them to stone, epic. 4, Gollum. One of the most unforgettable characters of Tolkiens universe. Andy Serkis, we love you! At first I didnt notice it, but after watching the Hobbit 4 times, I can see how Jackson made Gollum look just a little younger than when we see him in Rings. His acting is comedic, frightening, and very two sided. On the third time I saw it, I almost cried when Bilbo almost kills Gollum. That scene really shows, I think, how much Gollum is *addicted* to the ring. And 5, I loved the music. Great job Howard Shore!<br /><br />To all those reviews out there, saying the pacing was too slow and such, I disagree. I think that shots of the groups journeying were just long enough to show what was needed. I cant think of any scenes I would cut down on, except that the warg chase scene before Rivendell was just a tad too long. Just a tad, mind you.<br /><br />To Tolkien Purists, I count myself among you. I have read over Tolkiens works so many times, Im pretty sure I know Middle Earth and its stories and legends better than the back of my own hand. Movies will never be exactly true to the books, showing all audiences what they had envisioned in their own minds. Jackson cant please everybody you know. But aside from a few instances, this was pretty true to the book. The major storylines that were not were the whole Azog-Thorin ordeal, the Warg Chase, and Radagasts scenes.<br /><br />Concerning the Azog-Thorin thing, I didnt not care for it. I thought that it was ultimatly a way to make the movie more exciting, especially at the wargs part at the end. Ida been fine if it wasnt in there, but im not complaining that it is. I think it adds to the movie, adds to the film-versions of Middle Earth. And, Azog was pretty beast.<br /><br />The Warg Chase was cool, and likewise, it was for the audiences. My only problem with it is that the group leaves the forest behind, then two shots later, their out in a plain/rohan-type area. whered the forest go? and for that matter, what happened to Radagast? Obviously he escaped, but still.<br /><br />And Radagast himself was done very well by Sylvester McCoy. The way Jackson had him introduce the Spiders, and the Dol-Guldur/White Council plotline, it made a great amount of sense. If he had done it the way it was in the books, it would have taken too long.<br /><br />All in all, I think that The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey was fantastic, and really lived up to the bar that Rings set for it. It is a worthy addition to the Middle Earth film saga. My only problem, SHOW ME SMAUG!!!!!!!<br />I cannot wait for The Hobbit, The Desolation of Smaug, to come out this year.<br />That being said, to the Lonely Mountain!
B0090SI42Y|1.0|Some made comments about if you like martial arts movies, that this movie is for you - not true and not the case.  I am a huge fan of the genre and have been for a long long time and this is just a god-aweful mess of a movie.  The martial arts are preformed and with the quick cut edits - you don't see anything.  The fights are terrible.  The characters and dialogue are terrible.  The costuming was nice and the backdrops looked great, but other than that - wow, this is a stinker of a film and I waited and watched everything about it since I first heard news of this getting made - thirsty for this flick and all I got was disappointment.  Not a recommend.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Truly the British resurrection of Sherlock Holmes. It is well shot, well acted, well written. The mysteries are interesting. I actually like the movie like length.

B004UB9SKS|4.0|Since I don't know any French, I bought this to learn enough to get around before spending 5 days in Paris.  I needed an app that would work off-line, and this fit the bill.  I like how it was organized, with categories for basics, hotels, transport, etc.  The search feature also works well.  I didn't give it 5 stars because some of the phrases are a bit long, and you can't play them one word at a time to learn them.  For example &#34;Does someone here speak English&#34; is &#34;Y a-t-il quelqu'un ici qui parale anglais?&#34;  And the person speaking the phrase in French says it so quickly that it is hard to follow.  If it had the capability to touch one word at a time and hear just that word, it would be much easier to learn.  I don't regret the purchase, but for the money, it could be better.

B001NLKXK2|3.0|It was hard for me to relate to the thoughts that Alice might be thinking, as my aunt who has Alzheimer's doesn't seem to have that clarity in her thinking.  Maybe thats the difference between early onset and later onset.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|This might have made an interesting 44-minute TV episode, but essentially this movie has no plot for over an hour. \\"Searching for lost girlfriend\\" does not justify making the audience sit through endless, monotonous takes of a sad guy driving. People were shocked about Chloe Sevigny fellating the sad guy at the end but it's more of a consolation prize for the guy and is unnecessary for whatever great revelation ensues to make you understand why the guy was sad. The movie will leave you exhausted and irritated that you spent a small portion of your life watching it.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Great for turning off non-essential apps when you want your Android or other device to be running at top efficiency
B005LLSZNM|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to this show. At first I didn't like it and my husband would have to go in another room to watch it. The first episode I ever saw was pretty gruesome. My husband came in at season 4 and so when we had the opportunity to watch it from season 1 we did and I got hooked. It's a great show and every episode kept us coming back for more. I can't wait for the next season to start.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I hated this story. It made me cry... at least four or five times... then the next second, I'd be laughing... out loud. Not in my mind, silently but out loud where people could look at me, wondering what the heck I was laughing at, or if I was crazy. A couple of times, I got really mad, then I'd feel all warm and fuzzy like it was actually a happy story, then I'd get kind of sad again, maybe my eyes would even water a little... I could've just had something in them... then I'd laugh again. Doesn't the author of this book (Colleen Hoover) know that you're not supposed to make someone laugh when they're crying? I mean, come on! Isn't there a law? I'd just throw the wet Kleenex away as my laughter died down, when I'd have to pull out another one. In this economy, Kleenex is a luxury! Here I was, wasting Kleenex that could've still been used, thinking that the crying was done with and, what happens? Ugh!! More crying... with a smile on my face, at that! How am I supposed to keep convincing the people around me that I'm not really crazy if I can't stop laughing while trying to blow my nose? I mean, really? I read this damn book in one day. Not even a whole day... less than 24 hours. I just wanted to get the damn thing over with so I'd stop laughing while trying to dry the tears out of my eyes. Part of it was in a doctor's office waiting room, too! I'm pretty sure they all thought I was at the wrong kind of doctor, if you know what I mean... Here I am, snot and tears, laughing.... I blame Ms. Hoover. I think she's got some kind of arrangement with the Kleenex companies, or maybe the psychiatric community, or something....<br /><br />Now, didn't I read somewhere that there's a sequel to this book.... ? I better check it out so I don't... accidentally.... read it... Now where the heck did I put that Kleenex?
B0036OP0QQ|3.0|I guess I was expecting the radio version of some of the songs, especially I'm your baby tonight. Some of the tracks did not sound very clear for them to be on CD's.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|As with the other books I have read by Nicholas Sparks, I am always approaching these stories with some degree of trepidation. How will the story end? Will it be happy or leave me irritated because it didn't end the way I would have liked. The best you can says is that life doesn't always go the way we would like, so there is some obvious realism with these stories. This one, I found the ending to be a pleasant surprise. No spoilers though. If you like this genre, I think you will be pleased.
1402790546|5.0|I just read about how this was the first book written on a word processor. I ordered it, and am looking forward to reading it, though it's not a genre into which I often dip.

B00271HAK8|5.0|I was able to watch this with my son (who is 30 years younger than I am). He was able to relate to the humor in this film just as I had around his age. It is a brilliantly done movie and I really have not seen any movies that come too close to pulling off what this movie achieved in its originality.
B00B4MUSHI|3.0|When I found out that there was a MGR Vocal Tracks soundtrack after the pounding in my eardrums near-orgasmic experience that was the soundtrack in battle, I blindly spent money to purchase it.  In hindsight, I should have probably spent a bit more time actually researching it.<br /><br />For what is given, it is passable, you still get that \\"feel\\" from the game in the music, but to be honest, you do not get the \\"FULL\\" tracks that were done for the game, as someone who was expecting the full content because Soundtracks rarely skimp on their product.  Sadly, I have a feeling this was a case of executive meddling from Konami and I will sooner or later find out that the full content was released in another release.<br /><br />Suffice to say, I will give three stars for the overall product, but nothing more because I should be paying for the full content, not a skimmed down version that takes away from the character songs in providing both characterization and context as to who they were.

1594487154|5.0|There is a crack in one of my core beliefs.  The crack was created by reading Dan Pink's book.<br /><br />Here's the Core Belief:  Selling is for people who are tough skinned.<br />I'm not tough-skinned.<br />I don't need to learn how to sell.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />Pink begins the book by defining \\"sales\\" in the traditional way, that 1 in 9 of us makes a living by pushing products and services.<br /><br />It has always been clear to me that ABC (always be closing) is the ideal and that I could never sustain the effort to pursue a client so passionately and so persistently.  Now I see that I'm part of the 8/9 that is not the \\"obvious\\" sales person, but rather I'm in the \\"persuader class\\" -- so we teachers are all persuaders and we are always trying to find new ways to ask people to part with resources (time, attention and effort) to achieve something else.<br /><br />TEACHERS:  If you want to see details, then read on.  Otherwise, just buy Pink's book.  It's worth $20 to get a lesson plan for our students.<br /><br />If you teach the 7 Essential Skills for competing in the global economy (the Tonhy Wagner list), then you need this book.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />The idea of a global community connected on the web is clearly a \\"haves and have nots\\" situation.  The hotel wants to charge $28 U.S. for a 24-hour use and there's an outside contractor that offers in-hotel machines at $9.60 for an hour.<br /><br />IMBALANCE between sellers and buyers...<br />Dan Pink's book  TO SELL IS HUMAN is becoming more and more relevant for my teaching aims.  I can see that my students need Pink's viewpoint to help them navigate the older attitude toward sales (which is largely described by \\"the used car salesman.\\")  \\"Caveat emptor\\" attitude reigns here in Australia.  Pink describes the new environment of \\"caveat venditor\\"  seller beware... because the buyer has access to just as much info as the seller.<br /><br />I recommend Pink's description of the imbalance that \\"always be closing\\" generates and he offers three new ABCs:  A_______(attunement),  Buoyancy and Clarity.<br /><br />attune students to the buyer (listen, don't constantly close)<br />be upbeat and positive (buoyant) in the ocean of rejection<br />be clear about what is important and balance the positivity with data about how they are actually performing in the market<br /><br />You can find a good summary of the TO SELL IS HUMAN on the Internet and Pink offers the first chapter.  Perhaps in four or five years it will be generally recognized that this book is REQUIRED READING FOR EDUCATORS.<br /><br />I thought that Pink had gone corporate, wanting to turn us all into marketing agents for brand X, but I misinterpreted the author's intent.  He has been writing a series of connected books.<br /><br />Free Agent Nation:  Pink described in 2001 the rise of the independent contractor<br /><br />A Whole New Mind:  he described the capacity that we all (especially independent contractors) need to develop in ourselves to compete with Asia.<br />He described the work (the niche) that automation and abundance offer us to grow into.<br /><br />Drive:  \\"How to motivate ourselves and others\\" is what we independent contractors need to understand...  Dick Clark claims that Pink is overgeneralizing about \\"what motivates others\\" beyond money, but I like the idea that we can move people by appealing to Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.<br /><br />To Sell is Human:  It is clear that we independent contractors can create business for our skills.  We need to prepare people to persuade others to part with time, attention and effort to do something else  (which is the heart of selling).<br /><br />In other words, these four books are part of a curriculum.  Dennis Yuzenas gets it.  His focus on \\"building skills\\" at Oxbridge Academy has resulted in dozens of students who are focused on the Tony Wagner list of skills.<br /><br />I have a friend who told me, \\"I read the Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Monthly because smart people will tell me what is important.\\"  That's how I look at Dan Pink's oeuvre.  He has set up a curriculum that we all can choose to reach for.<br /><br />=========<br /><br />I'm writing this message in the lobby of a hotel in Sydney.  Import duties cause books to cost $40 when the hard cover might be $25 in the USA.  Fewer people will have access to Pink's ideas and that's why I'm leaving my copy of the book over on this side of the Equator.  I recommend that people in the USA  make a friend in the Southern Hemisphere and send a copy of TSIH to a teacher there.<br /><br />I also need to send a copy of TSIH to Enrique's school Highland Park High School to go with the growing shelf of \\"cool books from Florida\\" (my name for the collection of books that I left in the school to attract the students who might be curious).<br /><br />This somewhat disjointed email documents how disruptive Dan Pink's writing is.  I have resisted reading his new book since Dec. 10. That's 70 days of resistance since I first read the free chapter in December.<br /><br />It has always been clear to me that ABC (always be closing) is the ideal and that I could never sustain the effort to read so long and so persistently.  Now I see that I'm part of the 8/9 that is not the \\"obvious\\" sales person, but rather I'm in the \\"persuader class\\" -- so we teachers are all persuaders and we are always trying to find new ways to ask people to part with resources (time, attention and effort) to achieve something else.<br /><br />Attention, Effort and Time is another triplet composed by Pink, to go with<br />Asia, Automation and Abundance<br />Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose<br /><br />Teachers, if you have this book on your desk, if you write key page numbers on the edge of the book and encourage your students to read about the new ABCs, attunement, buoyancy and Clarity, then you will have done your job well..... the job of preparing kids for the future.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|These seek and search games are the best. I love them. Especially. when you can play at your own pace with no timers!
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|A different type of &#34;feel good&#34; movie, but you may not see it as a feel good movie. If fighting bothers you, it can be a bit difficult to watch at times. Overall, it's a good rental and Nick Nolte does a very good acting job.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you love building or being creative get this app!!! its toads worth it!!!! I love being creative so I got this app and its wicked epic! enjoy the app! :)
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Bourdain, ultimately, comes across as fairly humble and more self-aware than the average drugged out, over-macho egomaniac tends to be. While he exhorts the readers with his life of excess, and seems to revel in his tales of debauchery and vulgarity, he comes clean in the end, acknowledging his personal and professional limitations.  As he narrate his life in the kitchen, we see him clean up his act, eschewing heroin and then cocaine and, after flitting from one failed restaurant to another, he finds a professional home.<br />  Marco White, in his tell-all \\"Devil in the Kitchen\\" comes across as cocky and nasty, reveling in the \\"bollocking\\" he gives his staff, while more-or-less crediting himself with revolutionizing cuisine. Bourdain exposes the rough and crude kitchen life, but ends up accepting his share of the blame, acknowledging that others find a way to do it right, to turn out better food, without the hellish chaos. While expressing a love for food, and even more for the restaurant life, he praises other chefs for their ability and innovation, never really blowing his own trumpet.<br />  The book, though uneven, repetitive and at times, perhaps, more crude than it needs to be,  provides a very personal behind-the-scenes look at the life of a professional chef, and the raucous surrogate family a kitchen staff provides.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Crazy unique story. At times I disagreed with how he has lived but also understood why and how he got there. Interesting to see how he came through the other side.
0385528752|5.0|I work in public policy and have a really challenging project that involves changing the minds and actions of hundreds or thousands of people that I don't interact with regularly. This book has really helped me think through some positive, concrete ways to make change happen.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|When these movies came out much of the hooplah was visually based. However upon making their way to blu ray it seems laziness set in. The pictures for all 3 movies were grainy as it looked like a VHS; and yet the most annoying part would be the audio lag. The audio did not match the actors' lips and makes one think they are watching a Kung fu movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm glad he wrote his story down before he got killed. A nice touch was how he included sections by his wife that showed how she viewed some of the events he described. It's a good read.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I was very disappointed -  actually  I thought it quite boring up to the ten chapters I read - not interested in any future adult RK R
B007L5GDGW|4.0|This game is really fun and addicting, the only issue is that once you unlock a New verse you Have to do the verses before it again to get back to it.
0547848412|2.0|I read this when it first came out & thought I would love it. I just didn't. I forced myself to finish it only because it's my unwritten rule to finish a book I start (why I finished Fifty Shades of Grey too!). Everyone I know who has read it loved it and that's about the best I can say. Hopefully you'll be in that majority but I'm afraid I'm not. Maybe I'll try the movie when it's showing somewhere for free.
B000LB7G00|5.0|These are not easy to find.  It works very well for the software I am learning.  It is comfortable and easy to use.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The quality of this blu ray is impressive. I have no disappointments with the condition of the product, only with the product itself in the fact that this movie was a letdown after how good Part I was.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Reminds me if super Mario bros . LOVE IT!!!!! ITS VERY EASY TO PLAY AND ITS FUN FUN FUN . EVERYONE SHOULD  HAVE THIS GAME.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the detailed quality of writing and the way the author was able to make you feel<br />what the character was feeling
0062101897|5.0|No fights ordered a 2nd book, USA shopping is great, lucky we have access to transport or frequent flyer people.<br />Book was all the money worth of it.
1451695195|4.0|As I scientist myself I tend to be a bit of a skeptic about experiences like those claimed by Eben Alexander in this book. I have seen a number of books like it recently, but have not really been drawn to read them as they are easy to dismiss off hand, either being the result of a child's experience or by those with a clear religious background.<br /><br />However, Alexander's book is harder to ignore. This is from a man who began as a skeptic, although from a religious background and culture, but who also had these experiences while affected by a condition that makes it possible to rule out most, or all, of the previous scientific explanations for any NDE occurrence.<br /><br />While the author does tend to get a bit detailed with the medical jargon, which as a geologist is a bit detailed for me, I can see that he does so in order to show those who are interested what exactly was occurring medically. In doing so we can see that this was not an ordinary NDE, but in fact may very well be what all proponents of NDEs claim them to be - that is an actual experience of an afterlife. He supports this with an appendix that includes all possible medical explanations for his experience and why they offer no clear answer as to how this could have occurred, as well as a signed witness statement by the treating doctor that his medical condition was as stated in the book.<br /><br />Without delving into too many details, his written account is relatively easy to follow, and in fact can be quite emotional and personal. But you are left at the end with the difficultly of dismissing this account as easily as you might were it devoid of the scientific basis and understanding that the author has.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very interesting book that I think should be read by anyone who is skeptical about these events, so that they can be left to make up their own mind from this more scientifically grounded version.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I am an unabashed Spielberg fan. He has had his share of clunkers like \\"War Horse\\" and \\"1941\\". But then there are \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and now \\"Lincoln\\". Daniel Day Lewis completely absorbs himself in this role. I felt like I was indeed in the room with this iconic President. The reason I purchased the Blu-Ray Disc because the dialogue demands it to be understood on several levels. Though I feel that Sally Field was miscast, she apparently fought so hard for the role that Spielberg relented. Tommy Lee Jones was disturbing just as his role demanded. In a year of several worthy Best Picture candidates, \\"Lincoln\\" stays above the frey.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loving this series. The costumes and locations are all stunning. Historically accurate and a great early period soap opera. Yay
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing if you play you won't stop playing I mean someone will have to take it out your hands.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|great story line enjoyed the book a lot. It was a real page turner I could not put it down.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|I got this app and can't even make it to the third platform in explorer mode. The tilting barely works and its not even worth 99&cent; let alone free. I would not recommend this app.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I give the book a 5 star rating because the authors imagination and application of technical information were intertwined. Thus,even though it's highly unlikely, most of the events were almost possible.
B004U8VUUC|1.0|Within 15 minutes I was dozing...looked over and my husband was asleep as well.  Very boring - turned it off.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have been blown away by up converting, but the blu ray blows the original out of the way.  It looks and sounds great.  My remastered DVDs look horrible in comparison.
B008133MDK|5.0|Action, clever use of technology to track sherlock's thought processes, believable portrait of a friendship between Holmes and Watson.  Very worth the time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|More like season 2, this is a more-stationary season, with the prison being the focus. Character development always serves up a twist, as Rick and Daryl have been under tremendous stress this season. Pushed and frayed, they still fight day-by-day to do the best for each other, and stave off the Governor and his Woodbury compound. It is a must-buy, if you are in any way into The Walking Dead!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have had many fun hours with this simple match 2 (there is 4 of each) app, can be fustrating at times to get them all matched to beat your own score, I keep going back to it over and over..... I very much recomend it
B002VPE1WK|2.0|The backpack is great for holding most of the items I use with my camera but.......me being a big guy (6'-0 with broad shoulders) can barely get it on........and forget trying to fasten the chest belt. It would be great for a teenager but not great for an adult.
0761169253|5.0|Designed in style and content for the creative mind. Loved the inspiration that Kleon provides in doable way. Short read, long thinking.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app has taken over my life...in a good way! works great on kindle and samsung phone. use it, you'll love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play Subway Surfers on my Kindle Fire HD and I bought it in the amazon app store. The whole time when it changed locations it updated automatically. Now that the Rome update is there it prompts me when I start the game to download update. When I click the link all it does is bring me to the amazon website. I have no idea how to update it. I already tried to reinstall it but all that did was restart me on all of my stats. Any idea how to update it?
B0049M7BDE|4.0|thought it was a great story. saw it on TV but they bleeped out the Rene Russo nude scenes and i wanted to see what i was missing.
030726999X|5.0|This is a great book and an excellent read.  I got it at a good price and enjoyed it tememndously.
0679805273|5.0|I use this book for graduation gift for several years now. The condition, price, & often reduced  price because of number purchased at the ame time makes me happy with Amazon
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|Great stuff, classic Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars Live in their heyday. Mick Ronson was a great guitarist and we lost him too soon, may he rest in peace. Give this one a try if you are a Bowie fan.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book came to me described as &#34;incredible&#34; and &#34;heartbreaking&#34;. I found it neither of these. It was interesting and engaging, but it felt incomplete. My comment to others has been that it touched me, but it didn't *move* me. Definitely worth reading though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's great fun even as of right now. IT'S also fun for the whole family only thing I'd like to see is Redstone<br /><br />LOVE IT
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffers. The game is great I love the updates to it. This is a game you can play without wifi which is awesome if your in a long car ride or if you have a kindle (you kindle owners know wat I'm talking about)  but there is only one bad thing to this, the multiplier from what I have reconized it has no effect on points nor coins but otherwise this game is AWESOME :D I hope u get and on top of all of it .........<br />  ITS FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE :D
0446580848|5.0|Another great romp with John Corey.  Nelson DeMille is one of may favorite authors for good reason.  A good read and a good buy.
0553212419|5.0|When this arrived, I was a little surprised by its size, but quickly saw the benefits of having such a compact volume.  I tutor and this is much easier to carry around with me than the usual tome you'd expect this book to be.  When you read the first story, you'd swear it was current - all the references to Afghanistan!  Great book!  What else can you say?  It's Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his greatest creation, Sherlock Holmes!
B0094K1JPC|5.0|Funny movie! Harrison Ford played a great &#34;Grumpy Guy&#34;! Good for the whole family and a good lesson for being determined and not giving up.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|It was just what I wanted and it came fast and in perfect condition. I plan to get all the other seasons as well.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book kept me on the edge througout the whole book. It had communication, honesty, history & trust with the couple in the book. I loved how all those things played a big roles throughout the book. It also had enough sex scenes that you wanted more of it. I loved it.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I have difficulty reviewing movies. I just watch and enjoy. Know this one was really put together well and lots of great stories. Another thing, the actors and musicians seemed to enjoy performing just as much as I enjoyed watching New Year's Eve.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|As soon as I click on the Weather Channel icon it blinks and says it will not open  it`s useless on my kindle!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 because I love its new features and my favorite part is when he rolls down the rope
0451450523|5.0|my sister was a big fan of the movie based on this book, and she jumped for joy when she got this on her birthday and was very pleased.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Hip hop head here.  Best album I've purchased in a long time.  Totally worth it.  The louder the better.<br /><br />The version I received is NOT the censored version, so purchase without fear!
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|This is great app for the price. The e book converter is really good. The video converter is slow but works really well. A great help when getting stuff from my laptop to my kfhd.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loving this game!!! Gets totally addictive! The daily challenges keep it changed up, and I like that every time you update the game you're in a new location! I can't stop playing!
B008S4FZHI|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Scarpetta novels and find once started I am unable to put them down, I like the way Cornwell writes, her style and infinite detail which is often lacking in other crime novels, I particulary like the way her plots intertwine. Please keeping writing and lets have some more Scarpetta adventures.
B005RUUUAI|2.0|This is a horrible disappointment for me.I wanted to watch an excellent show in it's second season and what I got instead was a terrible show that couldn't figure out what it wanted to do with it's self.It spent most of it's time in a place that wasn't nearly as prominent in the books,and then had it's main character at the end of the season completely change.You may like this show regardless of how poorly it is done but I am not watching it any longer and am certainly not paying to watch it ever again.
0767840135|5.0|I love Cirque du  Soleil and this is my favorite show. John's dance with the hat rack is my favorite!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it. Beyond my expectations, the anticipation, the characters. Can't wait to see the movie. You will not be disappointed!
B009SQRL4U|3.0|I didn't find this movie particularly great, nor was it bad. It was sufficiently entertaining. I probably won't add it to my preferred Christmas movie rotation.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think u should get it but just to let u know it might get scragidy on some games. all tough ot is a good game!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I knew next to nothing about the Language of Flowers and found it fascinating.  Nor did I know much about the foster care system.  I found the protagonist's story compelling and incredible and was relieved that she found a way out of dysfunction for herself and the ones she loved.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I have spent many hours doing puzzles. But suddenly I get a black screen when I open it on my Toshiba thrive.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoyed the story and we were very much impressed with the acting in the production.  We had avoided it until all our friends shamed us into watching it.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|We almost bought a hot wheels garage instead of this but so glad we didn't. This is so well made and was easy to assemble.  So much more durable than cheap plastic toys.  All of our toy cars get a turn parking in this garage.  My two year old plays with this daily and it still looks brand new 4 months later, and he is HARD on toys.  It will last for many years and I'm sure many children will get an opportunity to enjoy it.  We will continue buying plan toys.  The only complaint we have is that the bigger/longer cars won't fit in the elevator (and its really not a complaint because this was not really made for hot wheels type cars.)
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|From the moment I viewed Phillip's audition on American Idol--think it was Thriller--I new he would at least be in the top three and as we know he won it all.<br />His voice moves the listner his words connects the soul.<br />[[ASIN:B00A3AUGEW The World From The Side Of The Moon]]
B009OINFH4|5.0|I have read all of Daniel Pink books more than once He is very well researched and has the common touch of turning information into insights that are immediately useable This book adds to a great body of work and I look forward to the next instalment
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is a great tv show but the quality of the video was not good. The HD kept having to catch up. Annoying.
0307887960|1.0|My friend followed this and looks amazing, I tried it for about 2 weeks and ended up getting really sick.  Not for me.
0439023521|5.0|Although this is not a genre I typically enjoy, I was immediately hooked on this book and the whole series. The story is very original and is a real page turner, which was hard to put down. The violence gets more intense with each book in the series, so parents should consider their child's age and personality when deciding whether or not their child is ready to read the book/series.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Exciting and easy to maneuver . Using all my battery time trying to get to the next level... it's Great
B0012Q732O|5.0|This is the most wildly inaccurate portrayal of life 12,000 years B.P. that I have ever encountered. It gleefully farts in the face of archaeological and paleoclimatological research, and embraces a standard of character dialogue that is on par with the Fifty Shades trilogy (i.e., bottom of the barrel). That said, it costs five bucks and provides fodder for a whole range of late-night drinking games.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy books I've ever read.  The the characters are well developed and compelling and the story is so captivating that I simply couldn't put the book down.  I'm a huge fan of Sanderson's work and have read nearly all of his stories - and this is my favorite of his books to date.  I can't wait for the sequel(s)!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is awesome it pulls you into it right away there is no other game as fun as this one I LOVE IT. I really suggest this game to you.
0439023513|5.0|I loved this entire series and book 3 was no exception. That said, the violence in Mockingjay was intense at times and likely not appropriate for some early teens. Some aspects of the story line felt redundant by the 3rd book, but it was still worth reading and was still hard to put down until finished.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is just like the Weather Channel, I get the weather for my state that I live in, and severe weather advisory that's in affect for my state, and tweets that I love to read from people in this country about the weather.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|I know I let everyone down. I was a member on the team who made this &quot;game&quot;. we did a lot of drugs and a lil' &quot;seducing&quot; of live animals;also a lot of things I'm not happy about. we should've never made this &quot;game&quot; it was never ready for this world... now I have to finish it... ...
1439170916|4.0|Cancer is a complex topic.  I was a bit skeptical about the book when it was first recommended to me.  However, the author has written the book so that it is fairly easy to read.  I find myself highlighting various sentences and ideas.  I know I will re-read the book to catch things I may have missed the first time.
030759565X|5.0|For anyone who clips recipes or prints them from the various cooking sites --- this cookbook is your answer to finding a wide variety of great recipes!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun. Doesn't get boring at all. I could play it all day. It has a lot of different things to do!
B005G5PPGS|3.0|If you like baseball or stories about the inner workings of pro sports this book is worth a goog look
0812550706|4.0|I put off reading Ender's Game but it comes up so much in conversation that I decided to read it for self-defense.  I found it to be surprisingly interesting and engaging.  It is an easy read, perhaps aimed at a younger crowd, but I found that refreshing and I looked forward to what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I sensed that someone who plays a lot of video games would probably follow the training Ender Wiggin goes through better, but I found that I didn't have to visualize every maneuver of the combat exercises to stay interested and get the gist of it.  It is less sci-fi than I expected and, as I think good writing requires, is more about the characters surviving and coping in a strange world they have little or no control over.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Intense but intriging to watch. To  see and feel the tension and fear the people experienced and knowing this was a true story was so captivating...every minute was worth watching. Amazing that they all made it!  Great actors and production!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is a very talented artist.  I'm looking forward in watching his concert this September and wish him the very best.  I love this CD.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I like listening to this on my iPod connected to my car radio --- feel like I am &#34;seeing&#34; the movie all over again.  Beautiful, especially Anne Hathaway's rendition of &#34;I Dreamed A Dream&#34;.  Heart-wrenching and emotional.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I did like this game....but then one day I turned on my kindle.....and opened the app and it erased all of my progress....so now I have to start all over again...I lost all my boards and my characters...
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is the best ever! Already recommended it to my mom who loves it too! We can get songs I couldn't find anywhere else!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Ok, the ending is to much.<br />Two members of the same family suffering a similar horrific end?<br />So now if they choose to let him not be dead next season. then he goes through rehab and peril like season one?<br />I love to watch this show it is candy for the eyes.  I love the portrayal of the impact of WWI.<br />NOTE TO THE WRITERS:<br />Stop killing people for drama, there is so much more material in addressing issues facing a modern UK.
145162445X|3.0|I agree with many other reviewers that the first half is adequate, but far from the best, review of the state of the art on cosmology. The second half is self promotion of the author's ideas with lot of repetitions and no proof. Furthermore the many derogatory comments on religion are out of place. George Lemaitre, a Jesuit priest and recognized theoretician on cosmology, was at ease with both disciplines. Lawrence Krauss should take notice and be less partisan. If he wants the Nobel prize he should design and execute the necessary experiments, admittedly a very challenging undertaking. &#34;Introduction to Cosmology&#34; by Barbara Ryden is more relevant to the subject and can be downloaded for free! Amazon also offers many other good textbooks on cosmology.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is super easy to use and I love the big numbers. I also like that it has M+  so I can save numbers too. It can do anything a calculator should do. It always works as it should and never has any problems. I would definitely recommend this calculator!

B0087JTAKW|4.0|I've loved all of Mitch Albom's books. I liked this one and all but it felt a little just rushed towards the end. But still a great happy ending.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|ex was good but just drama and  a horrible fall. This book is so long and descriptive for only covering a couple months.well see with the next.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|be better if earned more than forty coins when off the game<br /><br />but its still an addicting game<br />thank you for a good game
1600108512|5.0|There's nothing not to love. Peter Beagle's classic book is a heart pulling tale of beauty, mixed with sadness and joy, and Renae DeLiz' gorgeous artwork is just the right fit. It's reminiscent of the movie enough to feel familiar, but new enough to feel like a piece of art that stands on its own. I couldn't be happier with this book.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Even though we knew the outcome, we were still holding our breathes! Great acting, great directing, just an all around must see!
B004Y042N8|5.0|This is a really fun game! Some of the puzzles can be hard but they really make you think and work hard to finish them! I would recommend this game to all!

B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|In the several great reviews I saw for this book, no one mentioned that it is about adolescents and, in my opinion, for adolescents.  While the plot and writing were good, and I did manage to finish the book, the themes and characters were all about teenagers - irritatingly so, at times.  Have you ever listened to a teenage girl gush about her boyfriend, and the fact that their love is deeper and greater than any love ever known to humankind?
B006X5L6VS|2.0|All I can see are the satellites<br />Occasionally a constellation will blip for a split second.  Not fun at all.
0061478784|5.0|Book is awesome!! Fell in love with the movie years ago so I figured I'd read the book. Rekindled a backward perspective of the world. Which essentially is what people should look for in fantasy. Ideals that reside in the subconscious and alter our reality as a result of bathing in the flames of creativity... *Is what I would say if I had read more then 2 pages* lol.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Simple story line with good roles and characters.  Nice concept that no one is surprised by the lead chacter name being Sherlock Holmes, as if Conan Doyle had never penned the original.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I wish this wasn't my review of her effort after the Harry Potter series, but I was really disappointed.  There was none of the excellent description and fleshed out characters of her other books.  The germ of the idea for this book was valid, but the execution seemed sophomoric. Was it ghost written?  On some level, I hope so because she can do so much better.
B00AKO93JK|2.0|It's boring but gets the job done if you don't go to sleep. At times it's almost funny to watch it.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Everybody knows about your usual Greek mythology stories that Rick Riordan usually writes but this takes a huge turn with an amazing story with characters that you will love!
B00BESKTMG|4.0|This movie actually surprised me. I have seen many of these type of movies. But this was actually very  good. The fighting scenes were still a little far fetched,  but l was still able to really enjoy the acting. The plot was ok but the context was presented in very good manner. I found this movie to be enjoyable and fun.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have always enjoyed the g5 games. I love the mini games and the challenge of piecing together the puzzles and I really enjoy the story line of the mystery. I cant get enough...I play game after game after game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting so you should get the app!buy the double coins to it helps!!! Alot of people rate It 5 stars an I do to
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought it was pretty good. A little far fetched, but entertaining. I'll read the next book in the series.
B00846REIS|1.0|If this book's aim was to come even close to Fifty Shades of Grey, it failed terribly.  The story is so horribly written and it comes across as trying too hard to be in the same league as Fifty Shades or Twilight.  It's so bad that I can't even remember the first name of the guy (only that his last name is Cross). The lead female comes off as some slutty trash, all though she comes from a well to do family and supposedly was sexually abused as a child. Her actions do not come off as someone who was sexually abused as a child.  I didn't feel there was a real connection between the two main characters.  And in the author's vain to try and avoid to have too similar of a background story for the lead male character, she decides (hints at) to have him suffering from sexual abuse because Fifty Shades' Christian Grey already got the child abuse(physical) syndrome. The lead male character's vulnerability (or lack thereof) was just not convincing at all.  And unlike Fifty Shades, I really did not feel that the male lead character truly cared for the female lead character.  Everything just felt rushed.  Perhaps to capitalize on Fifty's sucess. The story is so laughable. Sometimes I manage to find the time to finish off a badly written book just so I can see how poorly the story is written and write a review about it.  Save your money and skip this one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great game for young girls. My six year old daughter just loves it. Recommend this game to all her age to about eight. I even enjoy playing with her.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is one of the best game ever. why is this for 4 stars! why doesn't every one have this game. theres so many backgrounds to use and the sords are amazing!
0756407125|5.0|Is that the third book is not out yet!  I re-read the first book before this book came out and I will, no doubt, re-read the first and second books when the third comes out!  Great series.
B004V9MU86|5.0|What a great concept for a book. I have fallen in love with this. Will become a book I read over and over again. Has opened my eyes to a whole new side to the war and the German people. Loved the book and would recommend it to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was an entertaining read. I know a lot of women LOVE it. I thought it was pretty good. The sex scenes are hot; however, I got bored after awhile. Believe it or not, I even skimmed through some of the scenes. It was a little too far fetched, but fun to read. I think being absolutely beautiful, filthy rich, amazing sex is a great fantasy, but unfortunately falls short of reality.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|It gave me so much to think about.  I will forever try to look at each day for what it will bring instead of just enduring it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really think this game is great for kids. Being a kid I LOVE this game.How they switch sceanery is really cool.I think it would be so cool if they could go to Tokyo or mars you could do a whole thing where you could be under water or in space.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 5 year old to my son-in-law play this all the time.  Like the different degrees of puzzles in the same game.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Anything that Josh does musicwise is top notch. I enjoy his voice, his vocals, and his piano playing. He has a relaxing style and gives me the type of music that I like. He just wonderful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this app because I love how it gets harder and harder I also like the last one COOL
B00881VLCE|5.0|fun to do and can be challenging if you chooose that way.  My daughter likes it too and we wish the pages  would change more often.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's easy enough to play the game. I love horses, so I was glad to find this app. Love the graphics.
B000009ED0|5.0|Love this CD and can't get enough of the track(s)!  Good classics that transferred effortlessly to my iPod.  Because was on CD, was able to share this with my younger niece.  She loves it too.  Must have for any KR fan!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|addicted to this!  my daughter downloaded on my tablet and I play whenever I am able.  The graphics are great and The cool Iris background music is relaxing.
055277832X|1.0|I should have read the reviews first before purchasing. This is the first book in the series republished with the UK title. So sad.... I was super excited to read another shopaholic book, despite the fact that the last book wasn't that great.
0345803485|5.0|Fellas....buy your wife this book. This is a very well written book and keeps you stimulated from beginning to end.
B000EZIJKO|3.0|other than no dust jacket which was the way it was described and why i chose this particular book the book is in great condition
B000PWQPAC|4.0|This movie lags in the middle but ok otherwise. It is not has good as the first one and you may not like it.
B009PJ1Q82|2.0|Didnt really care for this film at all. I understand film noir, but this was impossible to follow. Maybe its just me..............
B0018RA6DK|5.0|I could watch this over and over, they don't make thme like this no more! Eddie murphy and nick Nolte played their roles to the utmost!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love The Game but it won't let me update to Rome on my kindle fire it sends me online to my original purchase. Please help
0395389496|5.0|Reading this book at Christmastime will become a new tradition at our house. I love the story and the characters.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a good game but it is a little hard to play but it is still a good game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is AWSOME I'm in Rome right now on subway surfers.It looks soooooo pretty!!!!!!! I could play this game all day if I could!!!!!!
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|This is a very strange and fun movie with a very interesting cast. Recommend watching after a couple cocktails :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoyed the challenge.  Gets tougher with adding more suits.  Can be addicting.  Make sure to have time to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun new and I love the cute horses. I wish that every horse game was like this.get this tam now ahahaahah
B007JMW46U|5.0|If you have not read it and you like books of this kind, you must read it immediatelly! Very well written with vivid descriptions
B001EO748M|5.0|Wow, what an amazing series.  The costumes are gorgeous and the sets are as well.  The acting is superb.  I was concerned I might be a stickler for more accuracy in the casting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the lead, but I quickly got over the casting of such a young, handsome actor as the king.  He portrayed the petulant and spoiled monarch well enough that the disparity in the age and the lack of corpulence was a pleasure to overlook.  I frequently loan out the entire series to friends and family and it is always a hit.  The torture scenes are unfortunately very well done and I often have to turn away as they are tragic and disturbing. (spoiler:  I am referring to you, poor handsome violinist!).<br /><br />We visited London shortly after watching the entire season and it made visiting the Tower of London so much more enjoyable and meaningful.  Standing precisely where so much history occurred and where poor Anne Boleyn met her fate was much more intense for me.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and enjoy this series.  It is time and money well spent.
0525952926|3.0|More of the same. No big surprise and hás lost some of the magic after the first book. History is too obvious.
B00AEFYS2M|5.0|Great product ... very fast shipping
B0063IH60K|3.0|Nice to be able to change to left handed. Just right for break time at work. Easy on the eyes.
B008B92U32|1.0|don't... just don't!  It is not fun and is not really even worth the time to download.  Face swap... Stahhhhhp!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|When these books were first published, I didn't give them any attention as \\"everyone\\" was reading them.  Wrong decision on my part.  These are a must read.  Love the first and the third.  The second threw me a little but still a good read.  Must be read in sequence...

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not always an easy person to like, Katnisse Everdeen is true to her own instincts.  Who should she trust?  Suzanne Collins surprises us with the ending of her last book in her Hunger Games series.
B000S88JTS|5.0|If you haven't seen this move just turn to the person next to you and they can tell you about it.. It is the move that opened up motorcycles to Everyone, in a day when they had a bad rap..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing could not put down<br />If you have not read yet do not wait now now on to book two
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game! it is so fun to play and the graphics have changed drastically from Peps World 1. In a good way!!! :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy.  Not just for teens.  This is a great story of love, strength, and sacrifice.
B008Y78M60|5.0|I had never heard this story before.  It was fascinating.  We enjoyed it very much.  The fact that we could watch it without waiting to get a dvd, was even better.
1616550414|5.0|Only issue is it is a little Skyward-centric, but other than that, it's a really great book. Lots of useful informative info. I think my favorite part is the timeline.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I was planning to use this to afford myself continuity between a school textbook I have and portions downloaded for conveniece to my Kindle.  I downloaded it; was charged for it.  IT HAS NOT WORKED ONCE.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its the best game ever I recommend this game for people who like temple run and temple run 2 ,...............,,....
B00AG473IC|5.0|I bought this album because of a recommendation from a friend and I absolutely love it. If you like rock or punk, then you will enjoy this band.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is a delightful guilty pleasure. If you have fond memories of the X-Files or Star Trek The Next Generation you will love it. It has a strong sci-fi essence at its core, but is infused with more humor, sex, and violence than its predecessors. Don't take this show too seriously and you will enjoy it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Of the last three Bond movies with Daniel Craig, this one is a close second to Casino Royale!! The retro aspect of the move was great.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book was very interesting. It opened a whole new perspective on spirituality that was fulfilling. This is the second book that I have read from this author and the first book led me to this one. The depth and scope is of such that i read in slowly and at the beginning or the end of a day.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I probably should have reveiwed this product further.  I was simply trying to get more versatility from my Kindle. Have yet to find any value in it or even if functions - waste of money.
B000002PCS|5.0|The music on this cd is simply beautiful and filled with emotions. If you've seen the movie it will simply bring you back in the story.<br /><br />I love it.
B001JNND9W|5.0|I probably saw this film on a B&W TV while I was a kid. Today, I can see the several interesting details that Director Richard Sarafian put nicely on this 1971 film. My overall view here is that this film should appeal to all those who are nostalgic of the early 1970s and that feel attracted for the antihero character. In this case, the hero takes a personal crusade in the form of a car chase. In several passages of the film, the car chase remains an excuse to be critical and bring to the screen some of the hot themes of that era in the US, including racism, drug use, and free love. Thus, in many ways to me, this film goes in page similar to Easy Rider and other alike. Do not despair, yes, you have lots of fast moving scenes where our here (Kowalski) drives a supercharged, white 1970 Dodge Challenger and bits the bunch of cops chasing him.<br />Technically speaking, the Blu-ray transfer is awesome. Particularly the landscape scenes look awesome and a pleasure to watch. Please, not a very nice treat on this Blu-ray edition: for this little price you will get the US (99 min) and UK (106) versions of the film, with the UK version being about 7 min longer. Audios (and subtitles) include English, French, and Spanish. One more detail, the interactive menu is really nice and cool. I totally recommend getting this Blu-ray to those who want a definitive version of the film.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|This was a good read, but there were sections where the scenarios were a little weak from the technical perspective.  That said, my opinion is that readers of spy/intrigue novels will find this entertaining.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very handy to have on the carousel of my kindle. Now I don't have to hunt around for a calculator, I have one with me everywhere I go and its big enough to see compared to the one on my phone. No problems so far !!!
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!<br /><br />I was watching Sinister with my boyfriend and within the first 15 minutes of watching it, I turned to my boyfriend and said &#34;I bet the entity is using children to do his bidding.&#34;  Lo and behold, that is exactly what this film is about.<br /><br />The opening scene is provided as a shock factor (the scene of the a family being hanged), to automaticaly grasp onto the attentions of the viewers, but it did not amuse me in the least.  It feels as if this movie was just created as an excuse to show murder scenes in first person viewing, and a story was quickly created to surround this desire to create gruesome endings for these unfortunate characters in the film.<br /><br />The set-up of the plot was cliche, the characters were generic horror movie victims and there were a lot of plot holes (esepcially in regard to the antagonist - he did not seem to have a legitimate reason for taking people's lives other than the fact that he &#34;needed energy.&#34;)  While I'm on the subject of the antagonist, I am going to address his appearance: it was RIDICULOUS.  He was not scary.  He just looked like someone dressing up as a band member from Slipknot for Halloween.<br /><br />Overall, poor plot, dumb villian, waste of time.  I would not recommend this movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read. My first Gillian Flynn. Will try an read all of Flynn's books in order of writing. Would not put it down.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I had seen Chris Kyle interviewed on various cable programs and was most impressed with his dedication to helping servicemen with PTSD after their tours were completed.  I was shocked when I heard that he had been shot by a service man he was helping.  I ordered his book and was very impressed with his novel - I will be ordering the book he had ready for publication when he was killed..
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl started out very suspenseful. It was literally impossible to put down. Every page is filled with clues. I loved the twists and turns up until the end. I do recommend this book because it will definitely stimulate your angry side. When I finished I wanted to burn it but then I thought about it. This is what makes a great book, an unexpected ending that cannot be undone. The author has the final say. Flynn kept me on my toes the whole time. I'm still frustrated with the ending but it's amazing what Flynn does to the characters. He takes them beyond my predictions and expectations. I'm eighteen and I think I'll wait a long time before marrying after reading this novel.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Even better than first season....really enjoyed watching!  Would watch again kept me on the edge of my seat.  Great fun.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Makes you think it could happen, no kids  its a dark movie and nude scenes heavy language and drinking is rampid
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Despite some denials, this really is a prequel to Alien, and the only other movie of the Alien franchise directed by Ridley Scott. It is fun ride. Enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought this was going to be dumb, but cool graphics. I just downloaded it and haven't stopped playing it now for two hours.....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun and challenging easy to lose track of time while playing it. The more I play it the more I like it.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Harris does it again! With the same clarity and wit with which he exposed the lunacy of religious belief, he has done in the most persistent and, perhaps, most pernicious, of theological contrivances, &#34;free will&#34;. Great work, Sam.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This series is great entertainment.  I'm sorry I didn't start to watch it until the third season..  Could not stop watching!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The Subway Surfers is fun and educational.It will make you smarter because puzzles make you smarter your child will love this game,<br /><br />  ...........  ....  ..year10year old girl
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Always admired these men, but have even greater admiration after this read. May God Bless them and keep them safe.
B007REV4YI|2.0|To everyone who states this Bond movie, \\"Skyfall\\", is the best Bond film ever, I ask this question: What are you smoking? Except for the opening scene, everything is wrong with this pathetic movie. Why? Here's why:<br /><br />1. Do we ever find out what \\"Skyfall\\" is referring to? I don't think so. Perhaps a metaphor pertaining to the agents dying one-by-one? Unclear.<br />2. Is there action in this movie? Yes. However, it's so stupid and obviously rehearsed that its not credible (e.g. the scene with Bond attacking the Asian \\"gangsters\\" with his briefcase then falling into the pit with Komodo dragons/Gila monsters that were obviously computer-generated. Pathetic.<br />3. This stupid Bond movie seems to have different movies blended into it in a hopeless effort to win and attract audiences (e.g. \\"The Dark Knight\\", \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", \\"Goldeneye\\", etc.), instead of focusing on true film story development (ask any intelligent college/university professor if \\"Skyfall\\" had a story worth watching and they'll tell you, \\"No\\").<br />4. The scene towards the end of this laughable movie involving Bond's orphan house is so lame, there are no words to describe it's stupidity.<br />5. Unfortunately, \\"M\\" dies in this movie and so does this Bond movie.<br /><br />The only worthwhile elements of this movie were:<br />1. A young version of \\"Q\\".<br />2. A different version of \\"Moneypenny\\".<br /><br />If you are a true Bond fan, you will agree that \\"Skyfall\\" is one of the worst, if not THE WORST, Bond movie ever made so far.<br />That's it. Enough said. Think. Don't hate my review.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Has it all. Excellent actors, good script, family issues, historical and of course early Brit. It's a great Cliffs notes for those in the early UK study mode. But careful of younger viewers.  Explicit sex scense in some episodes.  Andrea Lynne  author Divorce No Law No Order.
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I bought this item fooled around with it for 2 days and then returned it. The camera plate knob broke after 2 days of usage and the counter balance adjustment knob has too much play in it and cannot be tighten which creates a a shimmy when moving around that compromises stability. The counter weights should come in smaller increments to allow for more subtle adjustments they were ill conceived and not worth the effort to fool around with ,As for balance I got it working once and it was all down hill from there ,The one saving grace is the  Gimble ,  handle and mounting and adjustment plates , if I could buy just those items I could build my own much more easily. It mimic's the higher end Steady vid systems but does not deliver in this Beta testing phase.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven was an excellent adventure. I didn't want to put it down. Another Nicholas Sparks winner. I can't wait to see the movie.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This series is incredible; and on Blu-ray, the video is absolutely terrific.  I rarely buy videos or movies, however, I believe &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is truly a classic and want it in our library.  We are  already looking forward to Season 4.  Regular shipping from Amazon was received sooner than expected and was the best  price I found anywhere.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|To all you haters out there who keep on talking trash about \\"Quantum of Solace\\", you need to stop smoking whatever you're smoking. There are so many facets to this amazing film that pays homage to the true Bond films that contain lots of action, entertainment, and fist-fights with villains (e.g. \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", \\"Goldeneye\\", \\"Die Another Day\\", etc.).<br /><br />Here's why \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is above the pathetic \\"casino royale\\" and \\"skyfall\\":<br /><br />1. More action (that's what Bond is famous for and must include to be worthy of being a Bond film)<br />2. More fist fights (that's what Bond is famous for and must include to be worthy of being a Bond film)<br />3. More car chase scenes (that's what Bond is famous for and must include to be worthy of being a Bond film)<br />4. More of a classic hero against villain story, thank God, instead of the ever-so-boring \\"skyfall\\" (that's what Bond is famous for and must include to be worthy of being a Bond film)<br /><br />I still do not understand why people think \\"casino royale\\" was a good Bond movie. Do I want/did I pay to watch Bond play cards for about 75% of the movie? Hell no. I can watch people playing cards anytime at a casino or on television.<br />Now to that other pathetic Bond movie, \\"skyfall\\". Do I want/did I pay to see Bond go back to his empty orphan house? That scene was so dull, mundane, boring, and depressing. To other reviewers who know what \\"skyfall\\" was referring to, kudos on actually not nodding off during that pathetic Bond movie. You probably took several grams of caffeine before watching \\"skyfall\\", which is why you were able to not nod off during \\"skyfall\\".
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Her voice is exceptional. I was a little disappointed with her rendition of &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; because she &#34;moderned it up&#34; with some warbles and sliding into notes, unlike her usual clear, perfect, spot-on renditions. Love the rest of the songs, though.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|This one was for my daughter!<br />She loved it and it was a steal!<br />Thank you amazon for making music buying fast and easy!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I have been playing this game for a while and really like the graphics.  Each level is well done with defined backgrounds.  I still have a long way to go to finish and I am expecting it to be a great journey!!  So far... it is a great game.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Well written with a good ending. Sometimes a little hard to follow going back and forth in time but overall a good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love thus game although I'm a little disappointed with how long the transition takes from one place to another compared to phones
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|So glad the Academy rightly ignored this film.  Bigelow always puts her garbage out strategically at the end of the year to be fresh in the Academy's eyes and steal an Oscar, like she did with Locker.<br /><br />First...I saw Bigelow on Letterman and she was such a jerk.  VERY arrogant  and acting all high and mighty and self-important.  Never really cared for her, but didn't hate her guts, but that Late Night interview made me hate her.  I tuned in to learn about the movie at the time, and she made me hate her guts in like 2 minutes.  Letterman would ask her stuff and she was all \\"OH that's classified, can't say BLAH BLAH BLAH.\\"  Um, if it was classified, YOU wouldn't know, wench.  You are a stupid Hollywood wench, no one will tell you anything.<br /><br />But she acts like a witch - hate her.  Glad Cameron dumped her.  Bin Laden was probably killed years ago.  But her movies stink - she makes the same movie over and over - what will her next one be about?  Some other war?  INGLORIOUS BASTERDS blows away anything she's ever done.  Tarantino is a million times the director she is.  Hurt Locker wasn't even any good and didn't deserve Best Picture.  Renner is the only thing that made that movie watchable.  Bigelow makes boring, badly made, overrated inaccurate garbage propaganda.  I hate that overrated self-righteous jerk Bigelow.  She's ugly on top of everything too.

B00061Q83Q|5.0|I got this vinyl to go with the reciever I got for Christmas. It was coming from Scotland and was scheduled to be shipped<br />to me in about five weeks. It arrived early, and in perfect condition. I was suprised, happy and very satisfied with my purchase.
B00122PUL4|5.0|Ronnie James Dio dying was one of if not THE hardest celebrity death for me to deal with because I have listened to him for years.  Got the MP3 version of this and it sounds awesome on my ipod.  Listened to it at the gym yesterday.  This is a good collection of songs hitting all of the Dio Sabbath albums.  I love all Sabbath A LOT, Ozzy, RJD, Tony, Ian, I don't care.  I love all the singers, but I believe Iommi and Butler are the backbone of the band.  Love those guys.  But Dio solo and with Sabbath is awesome.  I was listening to Die Young yesterday on the treadmill and got goosebumps, because Dio died MUCH too young.  And hearing him singing that knowing he is no longer with us was really an experience, like he was singing from the grave.  RIP Ronnie.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started watching this year and someone wisely told me to start at the beginning in season one.  I absolutely loved it from the start and can't wait for more. It only took me a month to catch up and now I am sad to see it end. So well written and acted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun game that u will be addicted to the first time u play it. We my family loves it and play it all the time on the go
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book. It is better then the first book. I would recommend this book to people who already read the first book. This is the sequel and so if you have not already read the first book then you would not understand it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I enjoy finding shows that I can get into and do not want to stop watching! Falling Skies is definitely one of those shows. The character development is good with enough variations between each that you can love the characters that you should hate (Pope!).<br />Although it is sci-fi based, you don't have to be a sci-fi lover to enjoy the show.
B009YQJ322|4.0|I've been a fan of Judge Dredd since the early 80s, when I started reading 2000 AD. I thought the first Dredd movie was ruined the moment Stallone took off his helmet, because Dredd is really an impersonal force. In many respects, he means it when he says &#34;I am the LAW.&#34; I understood why they had to show Stallone's face; after all, you're paying Stallone. So I completely respect Karl Urban's decision to keep the helmet on through the entire movie. The man's got serious nerd cred. He understood the character and the needs of the work, rather than going on ego. Moreover, you can tell it's Urban under the helmet. Those are some serious acting chops right there, and I don't think a lot of people recognize that about him.<br /><br />The story is pretty good. It's really your typical MegaCity One kind of tale. The city isn't threatened with doom and destruction. It's just an average day for a Judge on the beat. There are 20 billion stories in the naked city, and this is one of them. I like that kind of vibe. And the plot itself is pretty good. Drug gang takes over a hab block and locks Judge Dredd and Anderson inside. It's a great way to isolate the main characters, so they can do what they're supposed to do. Shoot every criminal they see.<br /><br />I really loved this movie, but there's a couple of things that make me give it only four stars. First, the violence was a little over the top. Skinning people, slo-mo bullets through the head, lingering shots on dead bodies -- it all seemed gratuitous. Judge Dredd was never about the ultra-violence. It didn't contribute to the film, and if the director was trying to make some kind of commentary on society then he failed. Robocop did a much better job of that. Second, Judge Dredd is ultimately supposed to be funny. It was a British take on American society during the Reagan-Thatcher years. It was over the top, with wry, sophisticated humor. Even the creators acknowledge that in the documentary. So it's sad that there'sno sense of humor, no elan, to this movie.<br /><br />Great plot, great acting, great production values marred by a fundamental misunderstanding of the source material (i.e., the wrong tone).

B0063IH60K|4.0|My husband enjoys playing this game when he has nothing else to do. The colors are bright and we like being able to choose between three card deals or single. Fun game to pass the time.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I read this book when I was younger,so glad I could get it free on kindle store!  The book is one of my favorite classics.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This game rocks, realy makes you think on some of the levels, dealing with gravity can be a pain some times but makes the game that much more fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is addicting and fun dont have top pay to play like most of the other games out there
B000P0J0EW|5.0|...In my opinion,anyway.It is my number one favorite film.That's for sure.Unfortunatly,when \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" was first released in theaters back in 1994,it got mixed reviews.It was also very under appreciated and somewhat overlooked.But now,years later it has become a cult classic,thanks to many Cable TV viewings,and has gathered a nice fan base ever since.Everything about this movie is great.The storyline,the acting,the musical score....EVERYTHING.Morgan Freeman is no doubt one of the best actors of all time,and he does an outstanding job in this movie.Tim Robbins is just as great as well.It's really cool to see him put on such a great performance,because unfortunatly,you hardly ever see him in any other movies.He is a very underrated actor.Overall,every DVD or Blu-Ray collector needs to have this in their movie collection.It's that great.I can watch this movie over and over again,and never get sick of it.I highly recommend \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\".Five out of five.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to take this Kindle with me where ever I go and to be able to check on my fb any time I am around a wi fi. Very handy.
B00BESM14U|2.0|The movie looks at some serious issues for teenagers.  I felt that the plot was dissappointing in that sexual deviance was thrown in to make it more interesting.  I think it's disturbing to think that this is what is aimed at teens.
B009XTF8JM|5.0|This was a great movie, it is nice to see horror makeing a comeback and not just slasher movies. I would and have recomended this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The original version of this game was addictive but this version is even better. Love the graphics and episodes! What a great way to pass time!
B00000DHZJ|2.0|Yes.I said it.Hendrix WAS not the \\"best guitar player\\" of all time.Not at all.He was good.Please don't misunderstand me,but he wasn't the so called genius that people try to make him out to be.There were so many other guitar players out there who were a million times better than Hendrix ever was.Stevie Ray Vaughan is one of them guitarists.He took the song \\"Voodoo Child\\" and made it his own.Hendrix could have only wished to play that song the way Stevie did.There are great guitar players out there that are underrated and do not get the respect that they deserve,such as Robin Trower.I am just so sick of people holding up Hendrix like he was a God or something.Most of the \\"music\\" he played was nothing but a bunch of noise.Listen to him play \\"the star spangled banner\\".He used so much distortion to cover up all of his mistakes.The only time he could ever play a song all the way through is when he was high as a damn kite.I am just telling it like it is folks.Jimi Hendrix is the most overrated guitar player ever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive and there are a few new features including new boards and an egg hunt, it is good value
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I loved this book a lot.  I wasn't a big fan of her other works, but something about this story and her amazing plot really got me hooked.  I've read some of the poor reviews of this book and you know, sometimes a story just doesn't work for you but I really thought it was ingenious.  I have read a lot of romances over the years and this one really just bowled me over because of it's originality.<br /><br />Minerva was a great character.  Yes, sometimes it got frustrating to see her be so meek and I think that's part of what has Robert so frustrated and intrigued by her as well.  I thought that both characters were so well written and developed and their romance seemed so naturally paced.  I found those two to be extremely believable while the other characters were more like caricatures for me.  Just really an enjoyable and unique read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I tried this game just because it was a free app. That was over a month ago and now I make at least one run a day.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this book had big words, it was a fantastic read. I didn't particularly like how it ended because  I wanted to read how Gus made the book end. But this book was amazing in my eyes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like the fact that it 's a whole new world. And it 's the thougt off hunger and the big difference between poor or rich. It could happen to us, the people in the west too. But in Africa it 's still happening.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A solid autobiography from a true American Hero.  He's no Hemingway, but that is not what I want my Navy Seals to be good at.  There are reviews talking about the fact that Kyle didn't talk a lot about his sniping, but I think he puts out enough info, at least as much as OPSEC will allow.  I highly recommend this book.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|The movie was that it was. Frank Hebert's books told the story. The movie tried to. For its time maybe best expected with all considered when others followed with mini-series on various networks. I give the quality of the product received a 5, the content for its time, a 4. The imagination behind it all a 5 but he is dead now. Am happy with the dvd of it that I received.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not quite up to the first two books. It's still good, but I got the feeling that Suzanne Collins did not quite know where she was going at a couple points.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Enjoyed playing this for a few days as a time waster sort of game. It's not terribly challenging, but enough so that you're not bowling 300's every time you play. Plus, the more you play, you get unlockables to get more items.<br /><br />It didn't appear that items you unlock yourself stick from phone to phone, so that's why it's only three-star. Good game, but lacking in those little things to make it wonderful.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Not Oregon trail. Was really hoping for something like the original TEXT ONLY based version of Oregon trail, I use to play on the teletype machine.<br />This is just one of those dumb games, that want you to spend real money to get more energy so you can click on dumb things that require you to spend more money to get things ect..
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I taught high school English and drama for 42 years, often with very bright students, and not once in all that time did I come across any student who spoke like the two main characters in this novel.  The vocabulary, the philosophical  ideas, the literary references--all seemed way beyond their years. That was one major objection I had to the novel, the other was the character of the Dutch author, who I didn't believe for one second, especially when he shows up not once but twice at the end of the novel. His character was purely screenplay, in my opinion.<br /><br />Having said all that, I still very much enjoyed this book. Gus and Hazel seemed real to me, in spite of the way they talked. Their story and it's foregone tragic conclusion broke my heart. The dinner in Amsterdam was lovely, as was the tryst in Gus's hotel room. Meeting in the Literal Heart of Jesus was inspired. So many things Mr. Green did right...and only a few wrong ones...again, in my opinion. I would strongly recommend this book.

B006AZZPCM|1.0|My kindle fire was working fine until I got this stupid app.  It shut my kindle off and I wasn't able to turn it back on at all.  I'm just glad I still had my warranty on it. don't get it.
B008JFUMT2|4.0|5/5 stars for sexy Russian gal Irina! What else can I say? LOL!<br /><br />1/5 stars deducted for retiree Bruce Willis. His acting in Die Hard 1 was so much better. It's almost worn out by the time he reached Russia in this 2013 movie.<br /><br />Watch this movie only if you've time to spare.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|Controls are difficult to use, even on beginner. Half the time, my gameplay was shorter than the cut scenes.  Even the startup screen is hard to understand!  If you're going to design a game, at least make it playable.
B005LAII94|2.0|If I had to guess, I would say that the director of this film is some young hotshot on the Hollywood scene. Hollywood probably has a lot of aspiration for him, and foresees even bigger, glitzier films. Whoever made this shows a lot of potential and you can just tell he wants to get at the meat of gritty reality. Unfortunately there is a lot of pomp and glam covering the entire picture that is, simply put, lame and often leads to inconsistent characters - case in point is Salma Hayek's.<br /><br />My suggestion to this Hollywood hotshot is spend about one year studying 'No Country For Old Men' - read the novel (as well as other Cormac McCarthy novels) and dig into the sophistication and gravity of the Coen's film version. 'No Country For Old Men' is a masterpiece in film and focus on that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game was better then the first, my niece love it plays the game every hour every day. she wont put it down.
B004LROMSO|3.0|5/5 stars for sexy Eva Green as Lady Morgan! ;-)<br /><br />I'm deducting a few points off for that evil criminal Merlin and dishonourable childish King Arthur. Down with both of them! Their actions make this series drag on like a British soap opera!<br /><br />If not for Eva Green as Lady Morgan to focus on, I would not have paid any attention to \\"Camelot\\"!<br /><br />I'm marching off with Eva Green.... I mean, Lady Morgan! ;-P<br /><br />Recommended viewing:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001LF347E Merlin: The Complete First Season]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003ES5JII Merlin: The Complete Second Season]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AF7Z44K Merlin: The Complete Third Season]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009VYF5E2 Merlin: The Complete Fourth Season]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00B5A9FLY Merlin: The Complete Fifth Season]]

B0092MKFIY|5.0|You know, on every album I've ever listened to, there has always been at least one song that I did not particularly care for. Most times, I find that albums contain three to four \\"filler\\" songs that leave me bored and awaiting another song. I can honestly say that there are none of these songs on Night Visions, which is the first time this has ever happened. Even the bonus songs are phenomenal (Cha-Ching, you must check this song out, it's incredibly uplifting). From It's Time, Radioactive, On Top of the World, all the way to Underdog, every single song on this album makes me feel happy, which is really all I want out of my music. There is almost a tribal/exotic influence to their sound that makes it amazingly catchy, yet still carrying an inspirational message that conveys the theme of the album, that you must be content with yourself and live life to your standards, regardless of what people expect of you or want you to do. I cannot recommend this album enough, I sincerely think that it has made my life better is such a dramatic way.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love this dictionary it is so easy to use.  I am not the best speller in the word so a good dictionary is a must.  I recommend this dictionary even to people who can spell.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|The official movie trailer pretty much sums up what you will see in this movie, unless of course you want to catch a glimpse of 2 pretty actresses.<br /><br />WARNING:<br /><br />The first 30 seconds consist of full nudity of sexy Latina actress Nadine Velazquez! This scene would be interrupted by a toilet flush (that sound could have been edited out!). LOL!<br /><br />You will also see the lead actor snorting cocaine and getting drunk in this over-rated movie and a 5 second shot of his rear ass.<br /><br />If the movie trailer isn't obvious enough, it's about an alcoholic pilot (played by Denzel Washington) who saves his passengers from a faulty plane that comes apart while he is flying it. Not all see it that way though and he is blamed for the crash. Along his road to recovery, he meets with interesting people who reminds him of the existence of God and his alcoholism. Is he going to be reminded as a hero or a drunk? He has to make his final choice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app I love doing the world tours I'm nearly obsessed with this app it's crazy awesome and crazy epic
055358894X|5.0|Very engaging characters and storyline. It left me involved with the characters and anxious for the next installment which I immediately ordered. It was refreshing to be entertained by an action novel that did not fall predictably into the pit of gratuitous social violence that is feeding into our world's  &#34;violence as entertainment&#34; pattern.  There is violence to be sure but it serves a different more abstract purpose. There are primitive notions of honor in this story that would go a long way to enlighten the leaders of today.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|This is a really good watch, especially for the money.  It's solid, well made and looks really good.  The fit and finish are excellent and everything lines up the way its supposed to.  The face is a great combination of traditional Seiko diver white on black modernized with Rolex style luminous hour markers with metal rings. I've been wearing it in Afghanistan for a while and I don't even have any scratches on it.  It's really accurate and the solar power is definitely a plus because there are no shops I would trust to change the battery out here.  The illumination is the best I've seen in a non-tritium watch.  Just like others said, the band is no good and too narrow, so I put on a 22mm nylon NATO strap.  The bezel is really smooth but not as tight as I would like, but it doesn't really move much on its own.  The crown and chrono plungers don't dig into my hand and the coating doesn't show any signs of wear or scratching.  This watch is a steal at this price and is the perfect combination of old school Seiko stainless case, updated but traditional looks with a high-tech solar movement and improved illumination.  Buy it before the price goes up!
1481278738|5.0|Easy to understand, and covers all the aspects of the camera that you will need to comfortably start using the Hero 3, regardless of the usage intended. This book uses surfing, but the info applies to anything.  Each section is supported with actual pics of what each lens looks like, one versus the other. Explains bit rate, and frame speed.  Also gets into editing.  Makes the confusion of the user manual all come together.  However, this book does not mean you do not reference the user manual. Digest the User Manual, then read this book. Very well done.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I'm very happy with this cover.I like the style and color.it keeps the screen from getting scratched,and the small pocket inside is good for holding notes.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun little game when you are bored. Has trouble shutting down and can drain your battery, but other than that it is fine.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book honest and straightforward.Any military person will relate. Those not military or war protesters should take notice what our soldiers go through so they can protest. Read it and learn.
B00A1U2SVS|3.0|I love Led Zeppelin but I am not big on live albums never really have been. I love seeing bands live however listening to a live recording just isn't the same as being there for me personally. But I never had the chance to see Zeppelin I'm too young. I picked this up as a digital download deal of the day for $1.99 so it was a steal thats for sure. With 16 songs this album is long and that is a good thing. As I had read from some other reviews that for a band of this caliber that you would expect the recording and sound quality to be a bit better and I agree with them on that. From Zeppelin I would expect a big production. My guess is that this would be amazing from the DVD stand point. Like I said I got the download MP3 album so I haven't seen the DVD but my guess is that would be the way to go.
0316228532|1.0|When you read children's books, shallow, stereotypical characters are a huge part of the fun - done so well by JK Rowling, Lemony Snicket, Roald Dahl, et al. When you read adult fiction, the expectation is for significantly more nuance, unless it's really good satire. Which this book is not. If Ms. Rowling was attempting to write a funny send-up of society along the lines of John Mortimer or Ruth Rendell or Alexander McCall Smith, she failed. Her characters are small, mean, selfish, unattractive cardboard cutouts, so empty as to be totally lacking credibility. The story line wavers and wanders from one extreme setting to another - from the slovenly addict's hovel to the miserable high school classroom to the abusive suburban household. Much of the dialogue is an exercise in overused foul language. I forced myself to keep reading only because I was astonished at how bad it was, wondering where on earth it was all leading. What was the point? Would any of these horrible characters be redeemed? What was the author's vision? Where was her editor?

B008JFUMT2|5.0|This is one of the greatest action films of the 21st century. It may be a bit old, but it still follows the standards that the first film set. This is a great way to end the series.
076115728X|2.0|After one reading, my granddaughter never asked for it again, and turned it down with every offer.  It's one of those feel good books, where the concept is laudable.  But that doesn't always translate to a child's favorite.  There is no story here, no beginning, middle or ending.  If you are looking for a book that a child wants to read over and over, try these:  Princess Justina Albertina, I'd Really Like to Eat a Child, There's a Nightmare in My Closet, or The King, the Mice and the Cheese.  Or if you want to be creative and make up your own story, buy, \\"Tell Me a Story.\\"

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino makes movies for me. Or more acutely he makes movies for people like me, people who love old movies especially the more dubious genre fare. So few people understand our love of these movies, which is why it is so easy to feel that Tarantino makes movies for the individual and not the masses, but he has established a very loyal fan base and has manage to achieve a success. All the while doing it his way and never compromising, making his success all the more extraordinary.  He has been tearing up the establishment for three decades now, truly an iconoclast.<br /> Django Unchained, his loving tribute to the Italian westerns and the blaxplotation western hybrids that starred Fred Williamson and Jim Brown, is no exception. In fact it is exceptional in it's own brilliant, original, often very funny, lurid way that only Tarantino could manage to pull off.<br /> This is Tarantino's most brutally violent movie, it is bound to turn some people off just on that, it is sure to offend (I'm looking at you, Spike Lee) and pushes the boundaries of good taste and entertainment. Yet, it manages to convey the cruelty and evils of slavery better than just about any movie I have ever seen.  This button pushing issue seems to be better left alone by our cultural mentality, but along with Spielberg's Lincoln, `tis is the season.<br /> At times as wickedly comical as Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, but never mocking and never loosing sight of the seriousness of it`s vicarious subject matter.. It's cool, it's thrilling, it's thought provoking and instantly quotable, in other words, it is just what we've come to expect from the maverick director, who also wrote the original screenplay.<br /> Tarantino's take on the west, or more specifically the spaghetti western,  is unlike anything we've seen before. Like some of his other films, it plays fast and loose with historical accuracy, but a lot of productions have done that in the past, still few as blatant as Tarantino`s reimaging.<br /> Told in a more straight forward and linear fashion than is usual for Tarantino, perhaps the untimely death of his regular editor Sally Menke had something to do with this, this marks his first film without her knowledgeable and distinct editing style. It as much of a mystery and full of surprises as any other of his movies, for quite a while I was happy to be uncertain of where the film was heading.<br /> Always entertaining, always fresh, vivid and original. Tarantino has taken the best the genre has had to offer and added his usual clever dialogue, keen photography (by Robert Richardson) and a liberal dose of interesting music all on an epic scale few movies today even approach.<br /> It's not unusual for a new Tarantino to be as full of an experience as Django Unchained is. Yet, it never is never anything other than a welcome refreshment among so many drab movie going experiences. It is extravagant and exaggerated, realistic and absurd all at once.<br /> Working with a splendid cast headed by a stoic and coolly powerful Jamie Foxx in a role said to have been written for Will Smith, but Foxx will make you glad of his casting. He is everything a gun slinging bad ass need to be, and has as much charisma as the star of Wild Wild West  does on his best day.<br /> However, as with most of Tarantino's films, it is the supporting cast that really sizzles. It is so fantastic in fact that it is hard to tell just who manages to steal the show. The Austrian actor Christoph Waltz, who deservedly won an Academy Award for QT's masterful loose historical epic Inglorious Basterds, is a delight as Dr. King Shultz, a wily German born dentist turned bounty hunter. Tarantino could easily spend the rest of his career just writing roles for this hugely talented and charismatic actor. It also great for Waltz, who with films like dismal the Green Hornet and Paul W.S. Anderson's misguided interoperation of the Three Musketeers, hasn't been having the best of luck finding a roleworthy of his vast talent in Hollywood productions.<br /> Much has been made of Leonardo Di Caprio's villainous turn here, and rightly so. as Calvin J. Candie, a cocky, self-centered plantation owner, this is Leo as we've never seen him before. He is vile and lovably so, this is Di Caprio's sharp turn into character roles, which I hope to see him in more of.<br /> Samuel L. Jackson, marking his fifth collaboration with Tarantino, sixth if you count the Tarantino penned True Romance. As Steven, a superbly written villain who thinks he's smarter than everyone else. As blinded by hate and as bigoted towards his own race as anyone else in this movie. Jackson gives a finely tuned and somewhat tricky performance depth and credibility.<br /> Also good is Don Johnson, looking like Colonel Sanders, as a hot tempered southern dandy. Johnson is starting to make a surprising move into smartly chosen supporting roles.<br /> A string of colorful cameos also add to the pleasure of the movie, especially for fans of  the genre and other cult film oddities. there is the original star of Django himself Franco Nero providing \\"friendly participation\\".  Also a very funny Jonah Hill, as well as Bruce Dern, James Russo, Tom Wopat, Don Stroud, Lee Horsley, Michael Parks, John Jarret, Russ Tamblyn, his daughter Amber, Tom Savini, Zoe Bell and even a badly miscast Tarantino, himself adding to the fun. James Remar, a cult favorite actor, plays two small roles.<br /> Tarantino's finely tuned use of music should also be singled out. He has always had a good ear, the music mostly recycled from old movies also, has been as colorful as his writing and smartly placed as his fine casting. Here we get everything and everyone from Tupac to Johnny Cash, as well as lots of beautiful Ennio Morricone tunes and other spaghetti western themes cheekily used through out. This is one soundtrack album worth listening to.<br /> As a movie I couldn't have been more pleased and entertained by Django Unchained. Evenwhen challenged, uncomfortable and feeling a little bit of white guilt, at a mammoth running time of two hours and forty-five minutes, I would happily had some more. I left the film pleased,  smiling, and like most of Tarantino's oeuvre, I can't wait to see it again.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Warning, seriously addicting show.  Great character development and human relationships.  Excellent. I highly recommend you begin watching from the first show, season 1.  You won't want to stop.

0307279189|4.0|we were drawn in by the story of the tara humara along with the side discussions of human evolution, the development of the running shoe and the anatomy and psychology of distance running - a great way to pass the time on the road
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great hack and slash fun with upgrade system for progress.  Certainly a great time killer at no cost.  Awesome buy would buy again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|captivating story.  couldn't wait to find out what happens next.  I did not expect the story line to be as good as it was.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I don't use video games of any sort.  A friend came over with his granddaughter.  It stayed in my kindle until they left.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|It works well after I remove my Ballistic case. It need room for the connection.  The price was good and I like it . Shipping was fast.
B0098R6M1M|2.0|I wanted to love this movie, really I did, but, the ending was AWFUL.  Just because one person decides he cannot do the job does not mean the end of the world, figuratively speaking.  I kept thinking about what is said when English royalty dies-- \\"the king (queen) is dead; long live the king (queen).\\"  The Church goes on regardless of any one person.<br /><br />This is one time when I really wish I had heeded the other reviews instead of going with my hopes that this movie would be all it could be.  I gave it two stars because there WERE some cute scenes and the trailer was good.  All the sub-story lines just kind of wandered around into oblivion though and the ending was so depressing.  I do not recommend this movie.
B007L5GDGW|5.0|easy and fun game to play if you get the hang of it. very detailed and stunning graphics. all in well a good game
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Unfortunately his books are becoming predictable, although it's still a good read just not up to par with his original books.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Oh my God, when I first got this game, I thought it was really weird. Then it became night and the zombies scared the crap out of me. Aha XD
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Best book for several years. Don't think I'll find something nearly fun as this one in a few years. Can't wait for the next volume.
B007XGJK4G|3.0|The footage was good, some of it looked like it was remastered, and the interview from different persons at the time was excellent.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very handy for sharpening anything from knives to fish hooks. I never go to the woods without it. Great for serated blades
B0020BUWX2|4.0|Loved reading every page. page. Love Love the way the characters are developed and familial relations are beautifully described. Author does a great job of making that \\"in between world\\" an actual place and presence.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a great game and it loads quick and easily.  I hope everyone likes it. If you want to buy more things in the game it tells you very well before buying.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I am 58 years old and absolutely love these books!  Some 12 year old recommended them to me.  LOL. Great stress reliever.
1884883303|5.0|The best pricing guide out there for under $25. Very important item for even small collectors.  Can't go wrong knowing the value of items you own or want to own.  Fast sipping too.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My granddaughter loves this app.  I take my Kindle Fire to restaurants and let her draw to her hearts content.  A real life saver when herding an almost 3 yr old. I've grown to use the app also as a teaching tool, using it to draw colorful letters when we go over the alphabet, and the &#34;stickers&#34; are really nifty.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is awesome, I spend hours looking at pictures. It also has fashion things along with funny things. You might be focused on getting as many followers as possible, but you'll find that just seeing pictures is, it's heart warming to see pictures of animals and nurture and I highly recommend it.
0345803485|5.0|....it was way to much for me.....i gave it to a friend......she said she couldn't put it down.....she is going to send for the other 2 book in the trilogy.....
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I support any singer whom can sing live and sound like ther album.  He's clearly NOT a studio artist but rather a true artist/singer.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love, love, love all but 2 songs on this album. The other 2 are OK it has been a long time since I have liked so many songs on one album. Each song is very unique and interesting. I have also seen them on Saturday Night Live since I purchased this and they also have amazing stage presence and energy.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Those were glorious days, right?  Watching this DVD is equivalent to opening a time capsule from the best decade of the 20th century.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is a great way to just play when bored. Especially with the upgrades of the game,for example instead of rio now i have it in rome,amd its pretty astonishingly fun!!!! If you dont have it,DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I knew of the popular song &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; and saw the album online for a very good prince and thought to check it out.  So glad I did... I heard a thirty second demo of the song &#34;Same Love&#34; and purchased the album immediately.  This could have been a gimic, the story of his uncle, but found out the story was true.  He's not JUST another rapper... he's a story teller and a good one at that!!  Now that I have had time to listen to the album I know now I would have paid full price.  Hope you enjoy as much as I do.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The best of all the batman film's. Action was very good. Acting also was good. Ann Hatheway as the catwoman was very good. The one thing that i was disapointed with was that the villian at times could not be understood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great my niece love the different types of horses you can get and the different compositions you can take part in. :)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved this book. Worth it to read this one. Now to watch the movie! What book is next on the Nicholas sparks list!!!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I am a huge fan of The Weeknd. The three free mixtapes (House of Balloons, Thursday & Echoes of Silence) are classics to me and having a remastered version does not hurt at all. I really want to see him make it far as an artist, so giving a few bucks in honor and support of receiving more great music is a deal I am willing to make.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This tragic story is that much richer for Kathleen Grissom's amazing characters. You at once feel a love for Lavinia, Belle, Mama and the entire family of slaves and a deep hatred for Marshall. I could not put this book down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I don't know why, but I missed season one and two when it was broadcast on television.  My first experience with Downton Abbey was with season three.  I fell in love with the story and had to catch up.  I've ordered both season one and two and have been catching up.  This is an awesome series!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Well thanks to this helpful app, I can catch the bus in the morning on time and not miss it. I needed an app to wake me up and to time myself and I got that all in one app. Thank you for the wonderful alarm app that you have invented. I appreciate the time you've spent reading my interview.
B000BNI99K|5.0|I bought this set for my sister for Christmas (along with his Christmas CD) and she LOVES it. I'm not a huge Rod fan but he was (and still is) a great recording artist and I borrowed it from her for a listen. This turn as crooner shows Rod's black-tie and champagne talent and he NAILS it. A nice fresh pause from the spiked red hair and spandex we all know and love. Speaking of champagne ~ here's to you, Rod!
B005LHOKFS|3.0|I'm a big fan of Trip Advisor, but their app is funky and clunky.  Definitely worth getting though because in a pinch it's nice to look up reviews for places you are considering going to on the fly.  The save favorites function didn't always work properly and didn't save to your account for viewing on other devices.
B0095P31L6|3.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie. They have asked to watch it a several more times with a lot of excitement.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is the best game that I ever played in my entire life everyone should get this game If not your a loser<br />I don't care what you think
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game for free it really is a fun game I play it like day and night you should get it
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I just love this app.  The only thing that bothered me is difficulty trying to set the alarm.  It's not very intuitive!  But it has really great, high quality sound and some cool features if you can get them to work!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game evarrrrrrrr! Please get it! It is great for car trips and boring things. So like I said ...........PLEASE GET DIS GAME
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Awesome I love it like super duper AWESOMENESS get it right know if your a angry birds or star wars fan!!!!!! But, it has a 2.00 rip of if they did make it like that, I'd  like it better.
B005EI86JU|5.0|There are so many functions and configurations that I didn't know about that made me realize of the full potential of this camera. This book covers them all in a self explanatory way. If you own a D7000 as an amateur photographer or have just come to Nikon from other brands this is the book.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|I kept it around for a few weeks as it was a free app of the day.  I played it a bit and enjoyed its graphics and functionality, plus the game premise.  But I did get a bit bored with it--probably because it's not really my kind of game.  It's definitely entertaining.
0062082353|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He found it to be so interesting that he couldn't put it down once he started reading it! He said it was one of the best books he has ever read! I highly recommend this book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is the best app next to jetpack joyride because you get to run fast and because its like temple run
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I discovered this artist on recommendation from Virgin Atlantic Airlines best find list. Lianne has an amazing range and varies her style on her debut CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A great game with only one flaw all the ads the are annoying and they interupt the game play. Please fix it.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my father-in-law. He absolutely loved it. If you know anyone that likes opera I highly recommend this gift
B004LROUNG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  The depth of the character development, the progression of the plot lines all kept me involved with the storynuntilmthe very end.
B00338QENI|5.0|It's a great book, very educational.  A great way to celebrate black history.  I wish they would teach this kind of important stuff in school.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I would rate this book a 3 out of 5. Not his best work and I have read them all.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Awesome story line and characters...quite riviting and refreshing. You just simply can't get enough, and the anticipation as to what will happen next is spell bounding.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is highly addictive! The new prizes and missions keep it entertaining for months. I wish some of the upgrades were cheaper though....
B0034JGBM0|5.0|Started out by only liking one song.  Not anymore! I ABSOLUTELY LUV the CD.  Jack White can sing all day for me
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic series.....  Love it!!!!<br />Can't wait till next season..........  All the performers are great.<br />Have told all about it and encouraged them to catch up if they<br />are not on board to be ready for the next season.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Every book by Colleen Hoover over is SO good. How does she come up with this stuff?  I almost didn't want to start this book because I didn't think it possibly could be as good as her other books. I was wrong. On Amazon, it says Hopeless #1 does that mean by any lucky change there is a Hopeless #2.  This book does wrap up nicely at the end which I like.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series is great! The book offers a great storyline, naughty fun, and some suspense. It really is worth a read and definitely one of the most exciting series I've read recently.
B008220C38|3.0|It was confusinf in the beginning.  You know, like going to a play and watching it on tv too.  Different
0525952926|5.0|bought the book for a gift, however it came quickly and was in great shape. i would deal with this sight again
B00280LYIM|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK. 5 stars. The best one yet and I consider reading it. ******READ IT****** *****ITS WORTH THE MONEY*****
B00B8ESWAM|4.0|Sure, this film is meandering and vulgar, filled with deeply unlikable characters and an imperceptible plot. It's veritable mind eff. An open vein of pathos, psychosis and fear. With arguably the best performance Joaquin Phoenix has ever or WILL ever give. He is utterly remarkable. Brilliant, even. The dialog between he and Hoffman is maddening and filled with a ton of inexplicable subtext. It's thrilling to watch. The Master is a perfect storm of literary skill, deft direction and transcendent acting. If Beckett, Bukowski and Kubrick had a love child = PT Anderson. I loved it, but I hated every. single. character. Truly, I wanted to punch each one of them in the face. Repeatedly.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reacher's life style is so fun..nothing to tie him down to anybody or anything.  I cannot imagine being that free.  His tories are always the best!!
B00BGD07KS|3.0|This is a very good inspirational song. Classic Mariah at her best.  I feel like it will be a top contender for the Grammys next year.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|As always, Riordan did an amazing job. I absolutely loved this book. I just couldn't put it down! Have to read the rest of the series now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best and its fun when you can jump the trains and collect coins and now collect eggs. You should get it!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I've read many Lee Child's books so I don't remember this one in particular.  I do know they are all difficult to put down.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I had hope at the beginning, but the book reads like an automated generation of fantasy cliches. There is no character development or depth, the is a forced feeling to the stories that I just couldn't get passed.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I bought this cover because the color, price and craftsmanship looked great.  It works wll and I would reccomend it to everyone.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great game I really love it. I bought the full version cause I loved it so much.Get it now and I'm sure you will love it to
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The quality and acting ability of Colin Farrell in this movie, for me, just proves Arnold really couldn't act back in the original, and he can't act now..
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Very nice movie, funny, visually stunning, and really, those accents!<br /><br />It's nice to find a &#34;kids&#34; movie that tells a nice story without having to resort to too many fart jokes and things.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I would give it five stars. I would prefer most Hispanics to read this to make there English-speaking more clear.
B005GIS23I|4.0|We liked this Movie, we found it funny and entertaining.  The Alien and the charactors were likable and easy to elate to.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book. One of the best ever. It was very original, and full of surprises. I hope to see more from this author.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you can manage a little less sleep and late night cravings for delicious food, download this app. All of the amazing recipes and ideas you can find here will make your tummy growl and your mind race. It's been deserving so far of the bags under my eyes and extra pound or two...:-)
B009CPES4I|5.0|Cutesy, enjoyable approach to how attitude to what life throws at you affects your happiness (and those around you too).
B008YKGQR4|3.0|This app is ok at best. it keeps refreshing every few seconds and when that happens, the screen jumps back to the top of the page...VERY FRUSTRATING! Developers fix this and we will have a good app :)
034580404X|5.0|Very good reading so far, but not done yet!! LOL  Would recommend this book to friends & family!!!!!! Thank You!!!!!
B0042RJWTC|1.0|FULL DISCLOSURE - Amazon is completely free of any wrong doing.<br />\\"The Tudors\\" has a definite manufacturing defect. We ordered two sets over the course of two months and encountered the same issue... unwatchable discs. I have 400+ DVDs/Blu-rays and have never had problems viewing any of them. We tried to clean them, replace them, and use different players with no success. Boo!
1439102813|5.0|Everyone past 40 should read this. I'm almost 80 and I found it fascinating and educational. Anyone who has a family member with dementia will identify with this.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this extremely well-written and bone chilling detective novel. Thiede doesn't waste your time with a lot of fowl language or poor sentence structure as many new authors tend to. He gets right down to telling the story in all its horrific detail with proper grammar, punctuation, and very few typos. The violence is graphic but not lewd, and there are several victims to sympathize with. If you like Dirty Harry, you will enjoy Time Killer.
B000C1YL1G|5.0|Every single song in this album is great! This album has some slow, fast, songs and this version includes 2 CD's, one is the original and the other one is called MIxtape which has some bonus songs, one with Biggie. I recommend this album to any Em fan.
B0000067L3|5.0|First of all, this review is gonna evolve over time. I was gonna write it all offline and paste it in, but Amazon's system doesn't seem to want to let me do that. However, Amazon doesn't have a character limit (like Yelp does), so this review of WHEELS OF FIRE is gonna eventually be long and detailed, and may even tell you something(s) you didn't know about Cream and topics pertaining to them.<br /><br />For the moment, let me just say that when this damn thing is finished, you will have (hopefully) a clear understanding of this wonderful recording.<br /><br />So please keep checkin' back and be patient with me; this is gonna take awhile.<br /><br />Heeeere we go:<br />********************************************************************<br /><br />Ever heard of a \\"Desert Island Disc\\"?  In case you haven't, here's how it works.  If you were stranded on a desert island, and were only allowed to bring ONE recording with you, and that would be the ONLY thing you would have to listen to for the rest of your life, what recording would you choose?  That's a BIG decision, and I'd like to hear back from any of you regarding that question.  PLEASE.<br /><br />Me?  That decision's EASY.  My Desert Island Disc would be WHEELS OF FIRE (I'll use WOF to refer from this point forward), released in August of 1968.<br /><br />ANYONE of any age who CLAIMS to be a Rock 'n Roller and DOESN'T have Wheels of Fire in their collection should be made to cut their hair, turn in their blue jeans, and be forced to listen to nothing but ONE DIRECTION.  FOREVER!  No, I don't think you're beautiful.<br /><br />Wheels of Fire is one of the best-selling albums of all time, and there's a reason for that.  In fact, Wheels of Fire was the FIRST certified Platinum-selling double album IN THE WORLD.  This one album has EVERY ELEMENT that defines what we call \\"Rock 'n Roll\\".  Most bands only capture a few of those elements; Cream hits 'em ALL.  This is gonna be long, but I'm gonna break this down for ya,song by song, as to why I feel that way.  And if you've heard the tracks, you're gonna agree.  If ya haven't, what?  Ya been livin' under a rock or sumthin?<br /><br />I personally think you need to listen to the entire thing IN ORDER, and that's the way I'm gonna review them.  I hesitate to use the word \\"review\\" because this album doesn't NEED a \\"review\\".  The entire offering, and each individual piece, are masterpieces of Rock 'n Roll of that, or any other era.  The only other band of that era that could possibly be put in the same league would be The Beatles.  Maybe.<br /><br />Anyway, here we go:<br /><br />DISC ONE: IN THE STUDIO<br /><br />Most people don't realize that in 1968, there were very few artists using multi-track recording, and even fewer multi-track recorders.  That science was truly in its infancy.  Besides The Beatles, Cream was one of the first to utilize the budding technology.  They truly were pioneers of the recording process.  And in other areas as well; we'll get to that in time.<br /><br />1. WHITE ROOM (Original song; Jack Bruce music, Pete Brown lyrics)<br /><br />Not very many bands incorporated symphonic instruments in a Rock setting at the time (Rolling Stones and Beatles did as well).<br /><br />By the way:  In the interests of avoiding redundancy, I don't want to keep bringing up The Beatles repeatedly, so when I use the phrase \\"most bands didn't\\" let's just assume (in some cases, but not ALL) that I'm AWARE of their contributions.  Deal?  This is a MUSIC REVIEW; we're not picking' the next Pope, after all.<br /><br />Cream has timpani's (also known as \\"kettle drums\\") in this song; really adds to the impact of the intro.  Also, Clapton uses a haw-haw pedal, a rarity back in the day.  Hendrix used one, of course, but in the recording process, it was heard sparsely.<br /><br />Music for the original songs was primarily Jack Bruce (music) and Pete Brown (lyrics), much like the duo of Elton John and Bernie Taupin.  They continued to collaborate long after Cream's demise.  With Brown's lyrical gift and Bruce's musicology, their songs were what put Cream on the map.  With the exception of Crossroads (we'll get to that, just be patient), EVERY song that charted for Cream was written by Bruce/Brown.  No disparagement of Eric Clapton intended, but while HE got most of the glory, especially AFTER Cream disbanded: THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO CREAM SUCCESS WITHOUT JACK BRUCE AND PETE BROWN.  They are singularly the most important factor in the entire Cream equation.  And Clapton's career without this springboard?  Probably just another \\"really good\\" guitarist, in a sea of others.<br /><br />Brown's lyricism is amazing!  White Room paints this picture of a sooty English train station, found love, lost love, images of silver horses and yellow tigers in dark eyes; the sometimes impersonal \\"fashion-ista\\" parties.  Brown is painting a picture that I, for one, can actually SEE in my mind's eye.  He really has a way with words; his poetry stands on its own even WITHOUT any music.<br /><br />The song employs what a lot of folks call \\"call and response\\"; I call it \\"Question and Answer\\", or \\"Q & A\\" for short.  This is when there is a vocal, then a guitar lead, both slightly overlapping, but not being sung/played at the same time.  At least, it starts out as not overlapping; by the end of the song, Clapton is WAILIN'!<br /><br />Also, the intro incorporates a 5/4 time signature in the intro, which is re-introduced later in the song.  Cream was really the ONLY Rock band in that era that broke out of what I call \\"the 4/4 mold\\".  OK, there was this little band called Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, but Cream pre-dated ELP's first commercial release by several years.  I don't think even the holy-and-sacred Beatles did anything that wasn't in 4/4 time, or at least I can't think of a single song as I write this.  I may get some responses to THAT if I'm wrong, but I welcome them.<br /><br />White Room was one of two \\"radio songs\\"on WOF, and is a masterpiece!  And a wonderful leadoff to the rest of the Wheels of Fire \\"experience\\".<br /><br />But there are MANY other gems on this recording, and the next song is one of them:<br /><br />2. SITTIN' ON TOP OF THE WORLD (Cover song; Walter Vinson, Lonnie Chatmon; arr. Chester Burnett aka: Howlin' Wolf)<br /><br />This about as Classic as The Blues gets. Clapton's very first chord has a hint of a shriek in it; probably wasn't intended that way.  But the song, like the character portrayed, is imperfect, and that stray lil bit of feedback just belongs there, like an old shoe.  And from the first note of Bruce's low, growly bass notes, the song literally reaches out and GRABS you, and I don't just mean the first time.  It might be just MY opinion, but if I were asked to pick the \\"perfect Blues song\\", I not have to think about it for even a nanosecond.<br /><br />This song's got quite a history; Vinson and Chatmon wrote it back on 1929 or 1930.  The version Cream does is basically Howlin' Wolf's arrangement, which he recorded in 1957.  This review is about the entire WOF album, but the history of this one song is fascinating.  Too many artists covered this song to list here, many artists you'd recognize, I promise you.  Do some research and you'll see what I mean.  Guess I'm not the only one who loves and cherishes this song; not by a long shot!<br /><br />When I first heard this album (and this song), I knew NONE of that.  I only knew that THIS is the BLUES!  Maybe it's because you can feel the heritage of this song without even knowing its history.  Maybe it's because it's so different than the leadoff song, and the sharp contrast between this and the previous song is so great.  All I know is that suddenly, you are transported from a cosmopolitan, civilized urban environment in maybe London or New York, and DROPPED onto a plantation in the Deep South probably pickin' cotton from sunup to sundown.  No money, no woman, only the clothes on your back, workin' your fingers to the bone, no end in sight.  Just dreaming, longing, for the day when you can leave for good, but it's just a dream; no way it ever gwine happen.  I've never been in that situation myself.  But you can just FEEL it in this song.  A song is supposed to TRANSPORT you.  And this one does, in spades.<br /><br />More of the Q & A vocal/guitar work, slipping into both Bruce and Clapton killin' it simultaneously by the end.  And Clapton's solo?  THIS is why he's called \\"Slowhand\\".<br /><br />3. PASSING THE TIME (Original song; Ginger Baker, Mark Taylor)<br /><br />This song begins with an organ that's not quite a church organ, but very reserved, accompanied by, what, maybe a glockenspiel?  I can't tell.<br /><br />The tranquil beginning of this song makes it easy to picture a lonely woman sitting in her home, staring out the window on a chilly winter afternoon, wishing her man was there.  It's soooo quiet because of all the snow on the ground (snow does that, just soaks up all the sound around it, for those who've never lived in it).  Winter and snow can make you fell so isolated, so alone, even more alone than you'd feel otherwise.<br /><br />But you've got wine; LOTS OF WINE!  Red wine, white wine, and plenty of time to pass.  Wine, wine, wine, enough to make you a little CRAZY.  Tryin' to maybe drink the loneliness away, then that wintery, peaceful feeling finally comes back.  But he's still away...<br /><br />Ends without resolving itself, fitting for this song, I think.<br /><br />OK, now on to the end of (Vinyl) Side One, and my FAVOURITE song (though it's hard to pick):<br /><br />4. AS YOU SAID (Original song, Jack Bruce, Pete Brown)<br /><br />Jack Bruce pretty much does everything on this song, from co-writing it, to the tasteful cello part, and YES, even the guitar part; Jack wanted Eric to do the guitar part, but Eric insisted Jack was the better man for this particular song.  I have to concur.  For all we know, it may very well be Jack onpercussion too; percussion consists of high-hat and cymbal.<br /><br />Why do I LOVE this song so much?  Is it that random measure of 3/4 time that creeps in, giving it the feel of a 7/8 meter?  Is it the sheer beauty of the verse (\\"...the rails have carried off the train...\\")?  Is it the cello?  Is it Jack Bruce's vocal, soaring into the Stratosphere?  YEP!<br /><br />Obviously, Cream was a GREAT Rock / Blues band, even among other \\"greats\\".  But songs like THIS are what only a band of studied musicians can do.  I'd name some names here, of Cream's contemporaries, but I would quickly start offending people because I dared attack their \\"sacred\\" band(s).<br /><br />Sadly, songs like this will never reach the casual listener; he / she are only interested in the Pop stuff, and they're missing out on so much.<br /><br />I said I wasn't gonna overly mention The Beatles, but I GOTTA do it here, because this song is every bit the MASTERPIECE that is evident in certain of the Fab Four's later works, just not nearly as well known.  Pity, that.<br />Me, I have never grown tired of this song.  It's been said that Rock & Roll will never die, but \\"As You Said\\" is not mere Rock & Roll; it is timeless beyond that.  However, I wouldn't at all mind seeing Hip-Hop get a deep vein thrombosis or something!<br /><br />But we must bid farewell to Side One of \\"In the Studio\\" and move on to Side Two:<br /><br />5. PRESSED RAT AND WARTHOG (Original song, Ginger Baker, Mark Taylor)<br /><br />Ginger does the spoken word on this one; no singing, just a poem set to music.  This is sort of an odd song, but then, most of the odd songs Cream did were spawned by Ginger.<br />\\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" are a couple of very eccentric shopkeepers who apparently went out of business and were forced to close up their shop.  No wonder; I guess there's not much of a demand these days for \\"atonal apples\\", \\"amplified heat\\", and even less of a market for \\"dog legs and feet\\", unless you're a dog, of course (at least under certain circumstances).  Pressed Rat also wore \\"red jodpurs\\".  THAT would make more sense if they'd been selling HORSE legs and feet; but then, Pressed Rat would have great difficulty riding the horse itself, wouldn't he?  No legs on THAT horse...<br /><br />Ginger's Cockney accent just seems to add that extra touch of eccentricity the song needs.  Wouldn't be the same if Bruce or Clapton recited it.  I didn't really like this song when I first bought the album, some 40-plus years ago.  Now I love it, and know every word.  The tune just has a way of growing on you, though I still don't have a hankering for any dog legs.<br /><br />The instrumentation seems to be deliberately \\"ducked\\", as the poetry jumps out at you.  The trumpet gives a kind of Old World feel to it, and Eric's guitar playing is more reminiscent of a string section in the background.<br />On the old vinyl LP, this was the leadoff song for Side Two of \\"In the Studio\\", contrasting sharply with the songs it comes between.  Very much a British sense of humor.  But I suppose no less strange than Paul McCartney wanting to get drunk and go hit on Queen Elizabeth II, huh (\\"Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl...\\")?  Except for ME, most people will excuse your lack of Cream knowledge (But I won't).  Having no BEATLES knowledge, though, is a horse of a different colour.<br /><br />6. POLITICIAN (Original song, Jack Bruce, Pete Brown)<br /><br />This song conjures up images of the stereotypical Fat Cat Politician in his big black limo, windows dark as night.  The Politician is totally in control, and he knows it; sound FAMILIAR?<br /><br />The lyrics are sure and cocky, just like the Politician.  Always tryin' to please whatever constituency he's in front of be it the \\"left\\" or the \\"right\\".  Just like I've always said, all Politicians'' main job is to GET RE-ELECTED.  SCREW the constituency!<br /><br />This song has not only a double lead guitar part in the solo section, but listen closely; there's aDOUBLE BASS GUITAR just wailin' away as well.  I've only heard that on a few other songs, and all of them are much later in the history of Popular music.  Revolutionary, or at least rare, to this day.<br />Whatever babe he's talkin' to, they ARE gettin' into that big black car; this guy doesn't take \\"no\\" for an answer!<br /><br />Another \\"Instant Classic Blues\\" song, if ya ask me.  Jack Bruce and Pete Brown were born the wrong colour, and way AFTER their time, ya know?<br /><br />7. THOSE WERE THE DAYS (Original Song, Ginger Baker, Mike Taylor)<br /><br />For the longest time, I thought this was another Bruce / Brown collaboration; I have a bad habit of not reading liner notes like I probably should.  So I was quite surprised to finally discover that this was Ginger Baker, again with the help of Mike Taylor.<br /><br />THIS is 1968 Rock & Roll?  Blows the doors off pretty much written today.  You can't compare this song to anything else, kinda like you can't compare \\"As You Said\\".  \\"Those Were the Days\\" stands on its own as another masterpiece.  There's that odd time signature thing again; doncha just LOVE it?  4/4 can be so BO-RING.<br /><br />Sadly, Mark Taylor drowned in the River Thames in January of 1969; he was only 30 years of age.  For having lived such a short life, he really was a very prolific force in British music, from Rock to Jazz and even Classical music, and well-respected by his peers.<br /><br />8. BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN (Cover song; Booker T. Jones, William Bell)<br /><br />CLASSIC Blues tune, to be sure, recognizable from almost the very first note.  This is one of several examples of what Eric Clapton brought to the table.  While not as prolific a songwriter as Bruce, he definitely had \\"one foot in the Blues\\".  The combination of the avant-garde style of Jack Bruce and Pete Brown, offset by the Classic Blues sensibility of Clapton, made Cream a formidable force.<br /><br />9. DESERTED CITIES OF THE HEART (Original song; Jack Bruce, Pete Brown)<br /><br />Another masterpiece by Bruce / Brown.  This might be an early use of multi-track recording, but  it's a good one!  The poetry of the lyrics, combined with Clapton's unique guitar work, makes for a one-of-a-kind sound.  Is Eric plucking the strings up above the nut?  How is he getting that SOUND?  I really don't know, but I like it; and he ain't no \\"Slowhand\\" on this one!  The lead guitar work in the short improvisational interlude is fast and furious.<br /><br />So, that's the Studio Disc.<br /><br />What do we have here?<br /><br />Along with The Beatles, this is the absolute BEST use of multi-track recording in this era, IMHO.  You've got truly original songs, ranging from Rock to  the eclectic, and Blues from the Classics to \\"new\\" (at the time) Blues that are Classics in themselves, from the moment they were created.  There's a mix of standard Rock instruments, sprinkled with symphonic gear here and there.  Poetry that stands on its own even without music, and just gets better with melodic accompaniment.  Double lead guitars AND double bass guitar, all in the SAME song?  Man, how did they squeeze all this on one album?  THERE'S NOTHING MISSING.<br /><br />Nothing except some KILLER LIVE PERFORMANCES.  Wait; we've got those too!<br /><br />But that's for the next installment.  The live disc is just as amazing.<br /><br />Here's what we have left, for next time:<br /><br />DISC TWO: LIVE AT THE FILLMORE<br />1. CROSSROADS<br />2. SPOONFUL<br />3. TRAINTIME<br />4. TOAD<br /><br />Thanks, please check back.<br /><br />larrythereviewer<br /><br />.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo, the SciFi movie never really made.  But then it was never intended to be.  After all it was faked by the CIA to try and get six hostages in Iran out of the country.  For those that didn't live it, it was a time fraught with tension and high anxiety.  The eighty plus other hostages weren't so lucky, nor were their families.  Those hostages endured horrible conditions and treatment for over a year before their release.  This movie centers around an agent that came up with the daring plan to get a handful of hostages out.  It would not have even stood a chance if the Canadians had not been so brave that they had taken them into their embassy during the American embassy takeover.<br /><br />Ben Afleck did a great job in producing, directing, and acting in this movie.  His excellent support cast, locations, camera work, and music make it a memorable drama.  I am glad the story was finally declassified and was made into a movie.  The story alone is well worth seeing, but the production values and the acting make it something you will never forget.  Let us hope we have learned something from that incident and that it never happens again.<br /><br />CA Luster
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Walking Dead season 3's first half was probably the best the series has had yet. However, I have found the second half of the series to be slightly lacking. Still, it is a fun show, and definitely worth watching. (4.5 stars)

B003O86FMW|5.0|This books was amazing! And when I say amazing, I really mean AMAZING! Gosh, why does these books have to be so darn good? Nothing at all was wrong with this book. The concept was well thought out, just when you thought that they were in the clear and bam they are bought back into the games. I liked how the book didn't automatically start out with Katniss and Peeta going back into the Hunger Games but rather them fighting to stay out. I love how the winners work together in order to have one another survive. I love the twist that occur every time you are just getting comfortable with the situations that are occurring. This book kept me forever on my toes and my eyes glued to the words. I love this and I feel that no matter what I will just have to keep reading.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|quite a bit of play time. skip button available for puzzles. challenging but not too challenging for the occasional gamer

B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't car  if other people say not to get it just get it. Me &amp; my brother have played every minecraft or minecraft related game and this is in our top 3. It's well worth $6.99  and if I were selling this game I'd sell it for what it's worth (which is price awesome!). Anyway this is the best game ever. The price they're selling it for is doing this game a huge disadvantage/understatement. So be glad that they're selling it to all of us at this price and don't complain. JUST GET THIS AMAZING GAME!!!!!

B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Ok, at first glance, one wouldn't know that this is a Star Trek movie; it takes place in a real, modern-day Earth environment, and has humor..........LOTS of humor. What?? This is Star Trek? Believe it or not, it is, and it's so different from the mostly serious, technical, precise, and oftentimes subdued atmosphere that has become the Star Trek universe. So, what was on Nimoy's mind here? Was he hearing the voices of a new generation of potential fans who were saying that Star Trek is too boring, bland, or anemic? In a bold move, he co-writes a script that has the viewer laughing so often, they wonder if this movie should be in the comedy genre. This movie is simply refreshing, as it portrays the characters in a totally different light, especially Spock. He is simply hilarious in this movie. And the plot: Well, it's Star Trek, so the plot is going to be quirky, but WHALES? Wow, this is REALLY different, but nevertheless sparks ones curiosity. I must admit that seeing these characters on our city streets took some getting used to, but that's all forgotten due to how this film delivers on humor and story. I highly recommend this very entertaining flick.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it both fun fr me and my kid it can help me big time out on some trips around town to keep him quiet and happy
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like this game alot and I would rate it with 5 stars but I think you should be able to play with friends with or without db because if you don't have one or want to.log into one it kinds limits you and I think that really sucks. I hope they change or upgrade his option soon

B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you like intrigue, romance, adventure, and suspense, Downton Abbey is for you. The contrast between the staff downstairs and the family upstairs is fascinating, yet they are all portrayed as people with their strengths and weaknesses. I watched the entire 2-season series over the course of a long weekend and was left panting for more.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|Let me just say that I saw this movie as a preview for another movie that I was watching. A movie that I can't even begin to tell you what it was, but after I saw this it peaked my interest. I wasn't really expecting too much because I got it cheap from the \\"Big Red Box\\" which is where I get a lot of movies now. That way, if the movies sucks, I don't own it, I'm not stuck with it, and I haven't paid that much to see it.<br /><br />Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I haven't seen Elisabeth Shue in a minute, and I have always liked her as an actress. At any rate, I know some of these reviews tend to over-complicate the movie, so I'm going to keep my review straight forward. Nothing was how I expected it to be, and trust me, I am rarely surprised or shocked by any of these movies nowadays. Quite frankly, it was refreshing to see something not based on a comic book character, or characters, or a movie that looks like somebody grabbed a camera with nightvision and went into their own backyard and shot a movie. With that said, I will include spoilers, so if you don't want to know what happens skip me now...<br /><br />First of all, it's really important that you pay attention to the flashback scenes because they explain a lot. Moving right on, the movie is about a 17-year-old girl named Alyssa (don't know if that's how they spelled it or not). Anyway, Alyssa and her mother have just moved to a new house. However, they are able to get this house really cheap because it's right next to a house where a girl supposedly murdered both parents with a hammer in the middle of the night. This girl is believed to be dead even though body was never found. Anyway, the house is suppose to be empty which was the lie the mother was told BEFORE she signed the lease only to find out afterward that the house does indeed have a current resident. She finds this out after she witnesses a light miraculously illuminate at 3:00 in the morning. The person that is living there is the eldest son of the murdered couple. Now, they say that he was suppose to be living with some Aunt he was taking care of when his sister murdered their parents, and now he's just back living in the house until he fixes it up and sells it which is what he said he was going to do.<br /><br />This is pretty much the basis for the movie. There are few typical parts in between like the teen angst between mother and opinionated teenage daughter. There are times when you see clearly that Alyssa and her mother don't share a great relationship. There is no father around, her mother is never home, she pretty much raises herself, and her mother seems to have a drinking problem which you can tell by the way she was polishing off the bottle of wine at dinner. The mother comes across as disconnected from her daughter, and insensitive  to Ryan because despite his niceness she doesn't trust him with her daughter.<br /><br />Moving further along, I will skip Alyssa and Ryan's introduction, the attempt at romance, or the relationship she was trying to start with a seemingly misunderstood, nice, respectful, guy who's just had a rough life. I don't know about anybody else, but there were many life lessons we hear about everyday in this movie: \\"never get in the car with strangers,\\" \\"mother knows best,\\" \\"this is the guy your mother warned you about.\\" However, most teenagers at this age tend to think that they know everything about life and people in general. Those are the ones who most often wish they would have listened to their parents.<br /><br />Moving even further along, you eventually find out that Ryan's sister is indeed alive, and that he has kept and been looking after his seriously mentally ill \\"sister\\" by keeping her locked and drugged up in the house. Now, the story that Ryan initially told from the beginning involved his little sister having a horrible accident on a swing set when they were kids. Thus, the head trauma being the reason she killed their parents. There isn't anyone who has watched this movie that can tell me that they knew what the twist was going to be at the end. We find out later on through flashbacks that much of Ryan's story was true, but what didn't tell Alyssa was that their lazy father was slumped in front of the television and their drug addicted mother getting high when his sister flipped backwards off the swing and bashed her head open. Then, he and his parents buried Alyssa and kept it a secret. The question was then.. who murdered the parents? Is it safe to say he did? Maybe?<br /><br />I went through several endings myself while the events were unfolding, and found myself with a lot of unanswered questions, which all will be revealed in due time I tell you. I had pretty much figured out that the \\"girl\\", or should I say \\"girls\\", you thought were his sister that he was keeping down in the bowels of that house were not really his sister because if you paid attention after her caught her he broke her neck, but when Alyssa finds the room by being just a little too curious one night she finds a completely different girl. That's when this \\"nice\\" guy flips the script and shows his true colors. Ryan has been kidnapping girls forcing them to be his sister \\"Carrie Anne.\\" I guess in his mind these girls were Carrie Anne, or they were going to be whether they liked it or not, and Alyssa is about to be his next \\"Carrie Anne\\" whether she likes it or not. Despite the fact that he actually likes her, but he \\"needs\\" to have another \\"Carrie Anne\\" more.<br /><br />At this point, you realize that this guy is a loon. I mean, he is just plain crazy, and we assume it's from the fact that he feels responsible for Carrie Anne's death, and his part in burying her. That's still not all of it though. The final twist, which you see in the final flashback is that his parents were responsible for all this. Apparently, after Carrie Anne's death his parents lost it, blamed him for her death, and therefore decided that he was goingto take her place and be their replacement \\"Carrie Ann\\" whether he liked it or not. I know that was enough to mess anybody up, but for a boy being made to play his own dead little sister was hell on Earth. Ryan's parents screwed him up, and he made them pay for it with that hammer. I guess in his mind \\"Carrie Anne\\" did kill them and the \\"Carrie Anne\\" was him.<br /><br />Crazy, but that's what happened! This was a good movie that left my jaw on the floor.
B001S86J0I|5.0|When I first saw this in the theater I think I missed half of it because I was laughing so hard.  This is a perfect parody that also remains a loving tribute to Star Trek. From the audience at the Galaxy Quest convention to the way Tim Allen sits in the command chair to Alan Rickman's dry delivery of his lines, this is a hysterical tribute to the show that started it all: Star Trek.  Even if you know nothing of Star Trek, Galaxy Quest remains a clever, brilliantly written, exceptionally well acted romp.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey , was excellent, the genre was interesting and made you feel like you stepped back in time . I enjoyed all the charachters they were drawing the audience in compelling them to watch the next episode to see what was going to happen. That is entertainment at its finest in my opinion.
B007P06DOK|5.0|I purchased the CD to replace the cassette tape I've worn out.  In my opinion, this is Paul Simon's masterpiece.  It's catchy and you can dance to it!  Have loved this album since the day it came out 25 years ago!

B00B49L7JY|5.0|One of the greatest documentaries I havr ever seen. A very inspiring story of greatness in a humble soul realizing the music he had poured from his soul touched a the very fabric of a nation a world away. Imagine making an album executives in the music world think is great then not selling any, then 28i or so years later finding out you where bigger than Elvis in another country. Simply unbelievably thrilling!

B003JTHXOK|2.0|I had high expectations for the book but was disappointed.  The story was very slow to develop, bogged down by unnecessary and meaningless detail.  It read like it was written at a 4th grade level.  I would rate it mediocre at best.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|These 8 films capture the remarkable journey of Harry Potter and his companions through a mystical world. Other reviewers have recapped the story so I will not attempt to restate these comprehensive reviews.<br /><br />The cinematography is vivid and sophisticated. Which leads me to my only disappointment with this BluRay collection: Some of the movies don't seem to be BluRay resolution. I feel like I'm watching a DVD in some cases. I've nonetheless rated it 4 stars.<br /><br />For those who are budget conscious, I'd think that buying the DVDs and watching them on an upconverting DVD player would give the same results as I'm seeing on this BluRay version of Harry Potter movies.<br /><br />After watching the BBC nature series on BluRay in eye-popping HD, I am hooked on seeing things just as the photographer saw them. In the case of the Potter series, I expected to see the films at home on my 1080p HDTV looking as sharp as they do in the theater.<br /><br />Sadly, you will not get the &#34;theater&#34; experience with these BluRays. Some discs are better than the others, and the quality varies from scene to scene.<br /><br />Overall, a great story with excellent cinematography, but disappointing resolution.

B002QAY31Y|5.0|I am a teacher of history and there is no better first hand account of World War II. The 26 episodes tell the complete story of World war II from the events that lead to war to the event that end the war. The original film footage is mixed with interviews of people who give their first hand accounts of the events. If you want a true picture of the horrors of World War II and how it affected the lives of everyday people there can be no other choice of films. I would give this documentary 10 stars if possible, it is that is that much better than any other documentary on World war II.

B007W1BLN0|3.0|LIke the book, it is a look at a young man turn his life into an obsession with anti-society, true wild, isolated life who finds out too late that he is lonely.  Well done movie, but the topic is not uplifting.
B008518MOW|5.0|The original Men in Black film was, well, original – a clever, funny, and ultimately satisfying sci-fi romp by three excellent actors (Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith and Rip Torn). Lamentably, for fans of the first film, men in black II was little more than a remake of the first film with slightly different peripheral characters and a female villain rather than a male one.<br /><br />Men in Black III returns two of the three original actors (Rip Torn was replaced by Emma Thompson) but adds a fourth – sort of – a younger version of K, the character played by Tommy Lee Jones (Josh Brolin). Since MIB III involves time travel (and the tricky paradox of going back in time to alter the future) the parsing of one character does not seem particularly unusual, and actually adds to the charm of the film. Moreover, although MIB III reprises the theme of I and II (saving Earth from from a psychopathic alien) the story is quite different and very entertaining. Best of all, except for a few minor touches that are largely unnecessary to understanding the story, MIB III works quite well as a standalone story, independent of the two previous versions.<br /><br />One final comment: for those of you having 3-D viewing capabilities, the 3-D version of the film is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />A couple minor criticisms could be added. Tommy Lee Jones is a bit long in the tooth to be playing an action hero, even an aging one, and Will Smith occasionally gives the impression he is playing a parody of his character in the previous films. That having been said, it is altogether good fun throughout, and a worthy addition to the franchise.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good tv show. Not as good as the first season. They better come up with a good idea for the 4th season

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I became intigued when I &#34;found&#34; the last 3 shows on tv.  Ordered the whole series from Amazon to start from the beginning.  Loved the whole three series and am &#34;hooked&#34; so can't wait for season 4.  Well written, well acted.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Two outstanding performers that really pulled the story together. Worth the watch if you want a laid back documentary. Got a little slow in a couple of places, but overall a great movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just wish there were more than just 3 books. Even though there should be a movie coming out soon!!!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Entertaining, emotional and a tribute to those who have fallen and fought for our freedom. Contentment to humanity, I recommend to everyone.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like this game for the most part. The graphics are pretty and the music is okay. I personally don't like timed games and some of the puzzles get hard, but otherwise I've had fun with it.
1878424319|5.0|My ex girlfriend showed me a few of Ruiz' writings. Very helpful stuff. Was just the catalyst I needed to break up with her :)
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This is the best app I have played for the kindle fire. It is so much fun and is actually challenging. You will lose track of time because it is so fun definitely worth $2.70. I recommend you get this!!!
0865478007|5.0|Very shocking, relevant, brave - everyone will profit from reading it. Good writing style too. Makes me want to read all his books.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book is definitely a page turner. Full of suspense but you get very attached to the main characters. I highly recommend this book!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I bought this book because I had heard AMAZING things about it. While reading, I was taken on an adventure.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|The watch looks good, but the self winding movement does not power it enough to last through the night.  It is not terribly accurate either- I look at my cell phone if i need the exact time.  I wish I had spent the money for a higher quality movement.
B006OE7XM4|3.0|Marvin Gaye, 'What's Going On?', remember Marvin Gaye's soulful, politically driven tunes, lyrics that spoke to the times, lyrics with balls... Gil-Scott Heron, now there's another cat with politics and art in the mix, and soulful. Yeh! Frank Zappa, outrageous lyrics and tunes. Captain Beefheart, high-octane high-energy poetry and music with a sense of humour. There's a fairly diverse tradition.. and they aren't the end -or the start- of the list. Bill Withers, yeh.. Grandma's Hands, Ain't No Sunshine (now all you cats know that!) someone else .. forget his name, anyway... That's where I'm coming from. So what happened to the songs that said something about the human condition? Lyrics that had a social conscience! Ok. Work Song. Porter sinks a sub with his take on the song Cannonball Adderley immortalised. Look, tell me who doesn't like Kurt Elling, Vince Jones or Mario Bondi, or whatabout Roger Cicero who can really do cheeeeze, but cut a great jazz album at the same time....Norah Jones. Ok, Ok, Gregory's cool. But this album is real cheesy... and, I mean, Bling Bling!!!?? What's going on?
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A Beautiful Masterpiece !!! While it starts out very slow and boring it gets exciting and scary and dramatic - very dramatic !!!. Ok sents their is only two things about this film that i didn't enjoy lets start out with that ok lets begin. The beginning of this movie well lets say the first um 30 minutes of the movie were pretty ugg slow. I was bored out of my mine with it i swear. It was so slow and boring that i thought about leaving the theater and seeing Red Dawn but i didn't. The beginning was just um well it didn't fit with the rest of the film and was not very nessesary to me. I mean all of that story about religion and falling for a girl for about five minutes then leaving her i mean come on was all of that nessesary really???? No it was not. The acting in the beginning was great but all together unnessesary. It was boring with only the part with the tiger being interesting. But after that half an hour the film started to get great, i mean really really good. The huge storm scene with the ship was epic, it was really, really cool. Actually there were lots of scenes that i found amazingly beautiful like the part with the whale and the animals who looked infact real but they were not they were animated but they were done so well they looked real.The second thing that i didn't enjoy was the removal of Tobey Maguire. Tobey Maguire was like way better at his acting as the writer then Rafe Spall was way better and sents the director decided to cut tobey like 2 months from the films release they had to like rush the reshoots and it made those scenes look well bad it was sad they cut him. It was a really bad move. Ok the good stuff well you already heard about the beauty in the film but i will still talk more about it, the acting in particuler the newcomer Suraj Sharma who to me did a realistic and great preformence, the cast,The director , the animation, the scenery , and everything else. Ok almost every scene int his film looks like a diamond all sparkly and wellpollashed, i'm not stretching the point they made every scene look better then the scene before it was just so pretty and man did i want to eat it up loved it. It was just so cool. The acting was very very good outside of Rafe Spall everybody looked like they really were enjoying filming of Life of Pi, Suraj Sharma in particuler gave a 101 % in trying he was great i loved him. I thought sad to say i thought he was going to give a really bad preformence but when i saw the film he was just amazing. Man Suraj Sharma has real talent in acting he does i hope the best for him. In the future i hope he is able to get more good leading film roles cause he deserves them he really does which leads me into my next conversation about the casting. Man i'm sad to say that now adays directors only cast well known actors in their movies like Will Ferral or Kevin James but the director who is really greatchose a cast of well newcomers who had little to no acting experience which worked for everyone but for the cutting of tobey who we already talked about.I believe directors should cast no more then 2 well known actors and put them in supporting roles with little advertisment on them sort of like Alice in Wonderland but they advertised the Mad Hater who was played by Johnny Depp like he was the main charactor and put him on the posters but they rarly advertised alice who IS the main charactor and she is not even on the poster i mean whats up with that its really stupid!!! The director was very good with casting which leads me into my next subject on the director. I rarly talk about directors when i review a film but i believe this director deserves some praise from me. The director was Ang Lee he was outstanding he was. The way he cast the film , produced the film , and brought the charactors onto the big screen , were amazing he is now in my top five best directors list he is, i loved him, he is great !!! The visual effects of the film are top notch. As i said before all the animalslook real even though they are not and the water and the ship sinking and the whale flying and the meer cats were so real i mean it was so good the animation was !!! The scenery was pretty awesome to like the island and india it was so cool to see it really was. All an All Life of Pi is an amazing award winner that is so Beautiful and all the Effert put into making this film makes this film an instant hit for people all over the world !!! A+ . Review by James Pasierbowicz
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Always loved catching this movie on tv, now I have my own copy and I'm enjoying it. It's by far my all time favorite movie.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|I loved the opening of the movie that explained the dynamics of the US relationship with Iran and Iraq.  It broke it down simply.  The tension that builds is steady.  I loved that there was no gratuitous violence, and that the humor that was mixed it seemed 'natural.'
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I get started and can't stop.  Fun game! Keeps the brain active. Give it a try yourself. Just don't blame me if you're tired at work.
B0086700CM|5.0|it cheats sometimes but overall fun game and very addictive. plus its free so a nice game to pass the time.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Great music for listeners of all ages. You can't help but sing along and such a mood lifter. A must have!
B007JRU2UK|5.0|Loved this. The acting was amazing, as was the cinematography!  Even with the premise of the movie, this showed how the family dynamic has changed.  The movie was uplifting, and left us feeling that family is everything.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Spirits of the Western Sky serves up a mélange of texture and spontaneity, time and space, veracity and melancholy, aerating within a vibrant bubble of unrelenting optimism.  A torrent of unfiltered feelings is plaintive and revelatory.  It pays homage to a past that brilliantly hues the present to confound and find the supplicant bereft of the right words, yet resolute that fate's mercy will secure the future.  The jumble of expression tumbling out brings release as the inner tumult churns to energize.  This juxtaposition defines the rich diversity, compelling disparity, visceral delivery, and urgency that perfectly punctuate the album.  It works.<br /><br />An incomparable wordsmith and startlingly evocative guitar player, Justin Hayward fastidiously strings words with a cadence both keen and precise, adds buoyant layers of harmony, and then gilds the whole with transcendent music tracks.  There's the craftsmanship.  It's the ensuing performance that elevates Justin to a class singularly his own.  No one distills a lyric, story, or melody with more poignancy and pathos.  That's his artistry.  It's his prerogative to tap that which inspires or enthuses to indulge his own pleasure of self-expression.  The integrity and conviction are laudable.  And what a delight it is to discover fresh facets within the bluegrass and dance track arrangements!  Elemental musicianship and exuberant vibes make hearts happy.  The inner child smiles and cavorts.<br /><br />Each of the 15 tracks is a star in the Western Sky galaxy.  Flashback/fast forward, constancy, fatalism, perennial hope, freedom, love, and home - the common thread is interwoven to shine in every number regardless of genre.  Arrangements are ethereal.  Vocals are winning.  The missive evinces an aching vulnerability and yearning, balanced by a confidence that wrongs will right given time and fealty.  Verses are not merely sung; they are heartfelt and frequently assume a conversational quality.  The voice quavers with emotion.  Mood is effectively implemented.  In the reprise of Broken Dream, vocals are soulfully measured and mandolins and strings close in rhythmic rain to evoke a doleful air.  The metronomic beat that imbues One Day, Someday seems to presume it's only a matter of time.  A similar passage of time ticks on Lazy Afternoon, so leisurely it suspends disbelief to constitute poetic faith.  The Eastern Sun is pure metaphysical romanticism, an ode of surrender Keats might envy.  In the Beginning is emphatic; the guitars simply sublime.  The less than half-minute Rising ideally tees up the club mixes that reiterate the plea sent out there somewhere which is, \\"hear my voice\\".  This message in a bottle is lovely, lovely stuff.  The inimitable Justin Hayward raises the bar once again.  Call me insatiable, but I hope an encore lurks not far behind.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Seriously???<br />I gave it 3 stars because it at least was well-written and had some suspense, but half-way through it became predictable and repetitive. Too many convenient co-incidences. Too many shallow characters. Too much sex and violence. If this is the UK's best book of the year, I hate to think what the second-best must be like.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Outstanding,realistic depiction of WAR.We owe a lot to those MARINES,they set out the foundation for the freedom we have today.
B004P12SSW|2.0|LOVED THE SONGS . . . but the acting was horrendous!  Great for a gals night of laughs . . .
B00A77II0U|5.0|I have purchased several hidden object games and this is one of the best. You can't lose buying an awkward game. You won't be disappointed.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I love this book, it gives me a clear view of the political climate just prior to the Civil War.<br />I know Doris Kearns Goodwin's book was based on the new Lincoln movie, but I still hope someone turns this terrific book into a mini-series.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I tried to like this book but couldn't get past how whiny the main character was.  I kept wanting to tell her to get a grip. The descriptions of the PCT are vividly drawn which makes this worth reading.
0062082353|5.0|Just as I finished the book, I heard the terrible news that this great American was killed by a fellow soldier at a Texas Gun Range.  Good stories and good insight to what goes on overseas..I recommend this book to anyone.  Rest in Peace and God Speed, Chris Kyle.
B002SR3T10|5.0|After getting hooked on \\"A Feast of Songs\\" (Medieval Carols with Medieval instruments) a few years ago, I dug this only-listened-to-once gem out of my Christmas music collection.<br />This is now my favorite Christmas album. This is more of a Solstice celebration. The religious carols are instrumental while the sung songs are Tull compositions.<br />Starting off with a rousing \\"Birthday Card at Christmas,\\" journeying through seasonal sentimentals like \\"A Christmas Song,\\" \\"Another Christmas Song,\\" First Snow on Brooklyn,\\" and \\"A Winter Snowscape,\\" we are treated to great, rollicking, joys along the way like \\"Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow,\\" \\"Last Man at the Party,\\" and \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells!\\"<br /><br />I bought the 2 CD with the live performance last year. Though the choir sang traditional carols, the Tull tracks were easily worth the price.<br />Spoiler - Where else can you get a Christmas blessing by clergy, followed by the opening bars of Thick as a Brick. Culminating in...\\"your three Wise Men Don't know how it feels, to be thick as a brick?\\"<br />Classic!<br /><br />Buy and enjoy!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Since movies today can't seem to be bothered with an original formula anymore, and they have a tendency to ruin formulas with &#34;reboots&#34; or whatever, it's actually refreshing to see a movie with an original story done well.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|It's a great movie for different reasons. It is nicely directed, the scenery throughout is beautiful, characters are all well cast, and the ideology behind the man (Wallace) is epic. Time and time again it comes down to fighting for what is right and not &#34;settling for the scraps from Longshank's table&#34;.<br /><br />The behavior of the &#34;nobles&#34; is very much alive today in that people settle for things such as money, power, prestige and forsake doing what is right. We could use a few Wallace's in congress today (and in the White House) :)
B008IBPMZG|5.0|With pleasure I watched hours on end of all 3 seasons and the only negative is that it is over ....i will miss downtown terribly :(
B004FRX0MY|1.0|It was great on my droid, but won't stream on my LG. That's a big deal to me as I was using it all the time. Now if I want a song, I have to download it to my device in order to listen to it. Guess I need a new place to buy all my songs and that sucks.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|At first i didn't think much of it, but then I realized that the songs were actually more catchy than i anticipated. If you are a fan then you won't have a problem with listening to this one. Overall great music at an even greater price.........can't beat it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 is awesome. Much more story action and advancement of the characters development and complete story line. Very good and I recommend it.
B007MJT13E|4.0|I swear this version of the movie had some extra scenes that I had not seen before.  The new scenes made the whole movie make more sense by adding context.  I really like the characters and storytelling in this movie.  The pacing is pretty fast, unlike most japanese things.<br /><br />Check it out, it is very violent, but not any more than an american horror movie or anything.
B002KYXO7A|5.0|My father raised me right, Fred, Ginger, Gene... The story still holds up too, the lip syncing is hilarious and kind of a repeating theme through the years. ;o)
1401307450|5.0|Anthony Kiedis did a fabulous job here. The stories are almost unbelievable and so crazy. I bought copies for friends and None of us could put this book down.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|This is a quickly accessible app. I don't have to go to the web to access google. And all that.
B0001I561E|1.0|I hate the Disney vault, it is evil, all it does is create an artificial scarcity to inflate the price and screw over the consumer.  Why so many people defend Disney and the vault is beyond me...
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I have friends that read this and flew through the whole thing.  For me some reason I have a hard time with it.  I like the story and the idea of it but the way it is written is just hard for me to read.  I am into it for a few pages then the writing just makes me tired.  I still have not finished it.  I may just wait for the movie.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It's super-sleek and durable. Already my 6 year old has dropped his Kindle and not a scratch on it :)
B008K6HN8I|5.0|does just it stated it would do; easy access to files & cresting folders. works great with my samsung III.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I don't really like the material this is made out of, nylon or something.  I don't like to touch it.. But I'm very picky.<br /><br />many of the pockets are pointless because the pocket is soo tight you could only put some minuscule in them anyways.  So really you will just use the main big storage area, and the big pocket.  It had plenty of dividers for your camera stuff, however it is not deep enough for my D4, I have to lay it down in there, which wastes a lot of space, and then the camera can move forward and backwards which I don't like, so I keep a rag behind it to lift it up.  Water can get in to this just fine.  The little tripod straps are too light weight and therefore useless with anything heavier than a lightweight mono-pod.  The weird stretchy things on the front are also useless.  The pockets on the side feel like anything you put in them will just fall out as the flap is junk.<br /><br />But, its cheap!
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I loved the first book.  This one was really good but not quite as good.  Again I was able to really picture the environment.  I liked the unique story.  Somewhat post-apoctolyptic but still it's own thing.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Well worth the wait, this collection of songs is the Perfect Fix for Moody Blues (and bluegrass) fans (alike). The three tracks from the 'Moody Bluegrass...Two' CD are priceless, and meticulously performed. The Dance Mix that Raul Rincon provides is astounding. And, the rest of the CD is worth it's weight in Musical Gold. Perhaps there could have been other instruments added here and there. But, the melodies and lyrics are certainly justifiably Justin, all the way. Pure musical magick.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 6 year old loves this game. very easy to use and super interactive. love the graphics. excellent for a free game
B005NFJAZS|4.0|This movie is good and cheap, and anyone that likes older musicals should enjoy it.  I really liked this in my childhood and I really like it now :)
B006LSZECO|3.0|With all the talk about this book I figured I should read it.  It was pretty good.  The first half to 3/4 was really good.  I felt like at the end the author wasn't sure what to do and just let the first idea they had stick.  I can see where people would disagree with that but that is how if seemed to me.<br /><br />I would recommend Never Look Away by linwood barclay as an alternative.  It was similar in that it was about a married couple and something terrible happens but I thought it was more exciting and not something I would just see on Dateline.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show and is easy to get lost in. If you like period pieces you will like this. Well written and very well acted.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Once again this complete series is worth having in your inventory of dvd's.  They are well written and very well played by this cigar smoking gentleman.  I hate the cigars but love the man.
B0014LX420|4.0|It was cheap, I like several of the songs, so why not.  I think I paid 2.99 for the whole album.  Great Deal!
B0093X805W|4.0|I have always wanted to read it.  When I was a kid for some reason I thought it was a big kids book and never checked it out from our school library.  I finally just read it as an adult.  It was pretty good.  The story was like the new movie and the old one combined.  I just wish it was a little longer with more description.  But it would be great for a kid.
140053271X|2.0|The nook was fine. I bought it as a present and when the recipient used it, she realized she would rather have the one that lights up. I asked to exchange it for store credit and buy the more expensive one but they wouldn't. I guess if you want real customer service you have to go to a real store.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I would love to know what happens at the end of the movie it sorta leaves one habging in mid air.  Come on lets finish this with many more episodes.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|It was ok, no great.  Mostly entertaining, kinda sad.  No stellar performances here, even from Eastwood.<br /><br />Its a rental, check it out, have fun, then return it.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I had to read this after reading the first two.  It was also not quite as good as the first book but I think matched the second one.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Great adaptation of a fun childhood game!  THe aliens were some of the best design and the technology was believable.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I am Watching this movie now again.  These are movies that one can watch over and over  as the script is a little bit hard to follow with this 81 year old lady.  But that is OK  as I Iove watching these two good looking gentleman play their part.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|I bought this for my GF for Christmas and she loves it.<br /><br />The movie is funny and entertaining, does feel a little too long though.<br /><br />I love it when Chris Cooper breaks out into a rap!  He is awesome.<br /><br />My GF loves The Muppets so she loves this.  I did not grow up liking the Muppets so I just like it.<br /><br />Get it used, its cheap and good.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was very different.  Yes it is another young adult trilogy but I liked it a lot.  The whole idea is very original and I liked the writing style a lot.  The whole thing was set in a strange setting and I feel like I was able to create a very detailed image of the whole thing in my head.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|One of the best Bond films!  Saying goodbye to Judy as Q was sad but a needed boost as well as the new Q.  Always the great chase scenes!  Some continuity issues throughout the film made it fun to see more than one time.  Thanks for bringing back the more traditional Bond beginning : )
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I missed one week and I was glad to see it was available the next day. The quality was good.
6305291500|4.0|First off this dvd looks terrible.  Like watching a VHS tape on my big screen.  There are also no special features at all.  I at least wanted it to look good, but this looks terrible.<br /><br />I also didn't notice that this was the full screen version, my bad...
B00AF6B22E|1.0|This is the worst movie i ever saw. The story was very wreak and the best part of the movie is the flying scene that it 15 min boy this movie suck. Forgod sack we know this is has a drinking problem why do we have to keep going on this has a drinking problem. The movie is way to go long. The other problem unnecessary nudity in beginning of movie PEOPLE GROW UP WE DON'T NEED NUDITY IN MOVIE IT WRECK THE MOVIE!!!!!. This the most boring movie i ever saw. Don wast your money on this piece of crap!!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I could not put this down. Immediately after finishing it I picked up The Ghost Brigades; and couldn't put that down either.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It has been a long time since I read a book that I couldn't put down. I  loved  loved reading.
B004IE0NY2|4.0|This movie is fun, not great.  Has some good action and effects (for its time).  And it has a good mix of jokes in there.<br /><br />Watch it, if you like it add it to your collection.
B007REV4YI|2.0|the movie is very over rated the action is good but as good as the other james bond movie the movies doesn't have enought car chase scene the movie get borning at time
1401922732|4.0|I bought this deck for a friend so I haven't, actually, seen the individual cards BUT I'm excited to see them when he opens his gift!
1596912863|5.0|I love Jane Austen as much as the next gal but I have veered away from the many, many spinoff and frankly unoriginal derivative novels out there.  That is, until Austenland.  I loved this take on the modern woman's obsession with all things Austen - and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.  Shannon Hale ala Jane Hayes summed it up nicely - Mr. Darcy pretty much ruined every real man out there for me.  As I'm sure he has for most girls.  I love how Jane confronts this unhealthy fantasy of the perfect man and through a retreat at Pembrook, scrutinizes it and in the end overcomes it once and for all.  I love how every character she meets, including herself, embodies or follows an Austen character or storyline.  But that's not forced - Austen knew how to write characters that behaved like real people.  They were authentic and that's why her stories are so timeless.<br /><br />Austenland is refreshing.  It doesn't make me want to run out and go to Pembrook of my own or even to find my own Mr. Darcy but it reinvigorates my love for Jane Austen's novels.<br /><br />It's funny, romantic, and utterly delightful.  I can't wait for the movie - which I really hope doesn't butcher the book.  These are my favorite lines (which I hope the movie keeps):<br /><br /> \\"It's not something you tell your single best friend.  It'd be like rubbing your nose in the poop of my happiness.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you're listening Big Brother, I refuse to be Fanny Price.\\"
B004EC5IUW|4.0|Looks great on the big screen, but not perfect.  Honestly I think a good american director should take the series and do a remake, because the peeps in Japan keep screwing this up.  The series is like the best anime series ever with the worst ending ever.  Starting with 2.22 this new remake movie series starts to go off the rails.  I don't think I will like the next one, just because I can see where this is going.<br /><br />Anyways, if you are a fan then get it, but don't be super excited.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Love t. Rihanna ain't no joke love number ten ain't nobody business number for throw it up and some ore. Love 80% of the album.
B000W2W4JQ|5.0|The Little Prince is one of my all time favorite books. I read it to my children and grandchildren- a timeless story of &#34;what is important&#34;.  Not all translations are equal-the latest one does not do the lyricism of the original justice.This one is a wonderful translation.  I love it.
B0000024JN|5.0|I liked this cd because it was original and still in plastic and played perfect and plus I recieved a free mp3 download before the cd arrived from amazon's promotion. This was an impossible cd to find in stores, so I am glad that amazon had it for the right price. I am extremly satisfied with this product.
0316077054|5.0|I saw the movie (first one) with my GF and it was aweful! But she loves the books so she was uber happy when I got this for her real cheap on amazon!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a very good game and I would  recommend it to anyone  but the only thing is that you have to turn the screen around so you are playing with your tablet upside down, this just might be only me but I have to rate it 4 star because  of this reason, but on the game it would definitely be 5star!!!
0743270754|5.0|It is a wonderfully researched and beautifully written book.  It is historically accurate anhd it reads likje a novel,.  The men and women become 'flesh and blood&#34; for the reader and these men and women were extraordinary.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|The instructions for this product are not enough for a novice to get it set up.  If you are a home business, you need to either be a networking expert or hire someone to help you.  This dramatically increases the price of the product.  Don't recommend this for home/small business setup.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I bought the album when it was on sale for 1.99 or 2.99 or something.<br /><br />I like Madness and one other song and that is about it.  I really like their older stuff more.  Maybe this album will grow on me, if it does I will write a new review.<br /><br />If its still super cheap why not just buy it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My child likes taking care of the ponies and completing the quests. Also likes being able to get new ponies.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Acting of main characters is strong.  By far this series still answers the question that's plagued many an adolescent/adult male mind, &#34;Hey, what if someone made a zombie flick/series and treated it like it was a serious piece of art?&#34;<br /><br />Weak parts include the human extras used in the show.  Either due to bad cinematography or direction, mob and group shots of extras just come off as shallow and unbelievable.
B009LK6JS2|2.0|I didn't like this game at all, immediately deleted it.  It just feels and looks like junk.  Definitely a copy of a game that I used to have on the iPhone that was much better.  I do not recommend it.
B000W9399S|5.0|This is a classic! You should read it especially if you haven't already. And if you have, then read it again! C'mon you know you loved it the first time...
B00821OX98|3.0|Like most males, I am a sucker for sci-fi post-apocalyptic stories.  The majority of the time I am disappointed because the creative teams on these types of shows either play to the lowest-common-denominator in their audience (ie. &#34;Earth 2&#34;,&#34;Terra Nova&#34;,&#34;Revolution (especially terrible)&#34;) or suffer from poor acting and/or direction...often times both.<br /><br />Falling Skies seems to just skim above those problems and delivers an entertaining, albeit sometimes cheesy/unbelievable story.  This show is watchable but not to the same quality as shows such as &#34;Battlestar&#34; or &#34;Walking Dead&#34;.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Very different reading a book with the first person viewpoint hopping between TWO people. I had to pay attention to whose mind I was experiencing life through. BUT, that made the novel very interesting and exciting! I fell in love with the characters! They seemed so real to me and I found myself worrying about them and thinking about the story when I wasn't even reading the book. I immediately dove into the second book in the series the moment I finished the first book. I was like, \\"Well, what's going to happen to Sam and Grace?!\\"    Gina Marie Long  [...]
B002WQZHJO|3.0|So, .... what's there to say about bad Denzel.  It's a different role for him and he played it well.
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|neat concept, allows users to view each section of paper, then select the one they want to  spend more time viewing.  Not as good as full size paper; yet on the go, it's a nice touch.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fantastic game!! Could not ask for a better game, looking forward to finishing the rest of this game real soon!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is intense and scary and is fairly gory, so be prepared. It keeps me on my toes, which I love!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Started off really good, but now mid-season it's pretty slow and boring.  I wish I would have saved the money and waited for Netflix or Prime.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really Great game  so much fun.  Really like to play.  Fun for kids. Easy to earn free gems and coins.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Well written and organized. Lots of facts without medical mumbo jumbo.Keeps the reader interested at all times.Highly recommended for everyone interested in health issues.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The best feature of this game is being able to access the game account from both Android phone and Kindle fire.<br /><br />The game is easy to understand, doesn't take long to accumulate coins and food, and racing on the track is a fun minigame.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|This is similar to X-Files to me, but I like X-Files a lot better.  Each episode is the seems to be the same, some associate of the crazy scientist is still working on projects 20 years later, the crazy scientist solves the mystery and all is right again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Cracking game, very addictive. Early levels easy but that is what draws you in. The more levels you get through the more you want to play.
1439102813|4.0|Very insightful and helpful for the average person, easy style to read despite a rough subject to read about.<br />There were even a moment or two of humor,
B00064X3FE|5.0|I have the Elton John cd catalog,all the latest remastered & Japanese shm-cds. These SACDs are the best sounding of all of them,and you do NOT need a sacd player to get the superior sound.<br />I do not have a sacd player (so i listen to the cd area) & I did a side by side (a/b switch) with this sacd & the remastered cd & this sacd blows it away. The same goes with the other Elton 70s SACDs. I would really like to know what makes these discs sound so fantastic.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Great, thought-provoking movie from Paul Thomas Anderson. Once again, he doesn't disappoint. Great acting from everyone involved. Great character studies.
1401216676|5.0|amazing story to one of the best villains ever in comic history it shows a different side and what pushes some one to insanity
034580404X|1.0|FIFTY SHADES OF GREY<br /><br />If I didn't already know FIFTY SHADES OF GREY started out as TWILIGHT fanfiction, I'd like to think I could decipher the code based on the myriad of similarities between the two novels. The following are a few examples (and by all means not a comprehensive list): a virgin main character; uber-successful parents on the boyfriend's side; divorced parents, where the daughter lives with her father; a clumsy, melodramatic, younger than her years main character; a complete hatred of receiving presents; a pale complexion and dark hair, where everyone finds her attractive but she does not; extremely attractive, supposedly out of her reach boyfriend; gorgeous, friendly, graceful sister; complete avoidance of high risk activities, except in the name of love; drives broken-down automobiles fixed by mechanic friends; the elusive friend who is totally into her and perfect in many ways but she's not interested; boyfriend tells her on multiple occasions that he's not right for her and does everything he can to discourage her affection; and despite being a virgin, she is magically good in bed and a skilled lover.<br /><br />Or in other words, what we have here is teenage fantasy supposedly based in reality, yet with TWILIGHT the reader already has the suspension of disbelief, since it's a vampire/werewolf/human love triangle. With FIFTY SHADES OF GREY, the teenage fantasy plays out in real time and on the streets of Seattle and Portland, among other locations. Sure her ability to orgasm on command was a bit comical, and her number of orgasms in Grey's presence could probably satisfy an entire church choir, but this is teenage fantasy after all, and in this regard it very much resembles TWILIGHT, although at least like any normal couple there was actual sex involved. In that regard, I must give E.L. James credit, because she literally held nothing back, and I was certainly entertained.<br /><br />Setting aside the teenage fantasy bit for a minute, the relationship between Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele was actually believable and intriguing, yet based on Christian's propensity for subs and lack of ability to love, I did find it a bit comical that she broke up with him after three weeks or so because he wasn't willing to profess his undying love and affection. So, yes, I'm intrigued to read the next book, and in fact, I've already started it, but my wife has told me it gets worse from here. So I approach the finish line with trepidation, but I vow to make it all the way through, one way or another, and I shall do it all in the name of scientific research. Yes, that's what I shall tell the curiosity demon that harbors within me.<br /><br />FIFTY SHADES DARKER<br /><br />FIVE DAYS. A good alternative title for this series. Why? That's the extent of the breakup of Christian and Anastasia. I've had goldfish when I was six last longer than that. Sure, short breakups can happen, mere hiccups in the game of life, but this one seemed forced, and the questions that hadn't been answered before the breakup certainly weren't answered when the two of them got back together. It was like a high school crush that suddenly turned into a high school crush again, and based on the relationship and its ramifications, the two lovers deserved something more. As readers we deserved a little bit more.<br /><br />As for the sexual encounters--and FIFTY SHADES DARKER certainly had plenty of those, not that I'm complaining mind you--they reminded me of a conductor with a baton, leading up to some dramatic crescendo or climax. Every. Single. Time. The batting 1.000 climax did strain my believability just a bit, which led me to the following question: What percentage of women climax from penetration alone? This book certainly led me to ponder questions of the universe like this, and being a guy, I don't have a definitive answer. All I know is Anastasia reminded me of a fembot with machine gun jubblies and a platinum vagina who was wetterthan the Euphrates and comes on command. Not that this is a bad thing if your setting is an alternate universe with alien life forms, then you can certainly make up your own rules. Since this setting is the real world, though, the FIFTY SHADES OF GREY trilogy should be grounded in some semblance of reality, not a teenage fantasy with twenty-something year olds with raging hormones.<br /><br />Probably the single most detrimental aspect of this novel, though, was the dramatic and abrupt change in Christian's personality. For the first two-thirds of this novel, coupled with the entire previous one, we had 890 pages of Christian being Christian. He was strong, tough, distant, and probably a bit too beautiful for his own good, but I'm nitpicking here. In other words, he made this novel interesting, until he metamorphosed into some alien life form and became a submissive to Anastasia, all based on Ana threatening to leave. Which made absolutely no sense because she'd already left once before, for no really strong reason, thus proving her instability. Instead of manning up, like his character should have done, he dropped to his knees and stared at her with pleading, puppy dog eyes. I might have coughed up my Cheerios, had it not been over fourteen hours since breakfast.<br /><br />FIFTY SHADES FREED<br /><br />I feel like I've been cheated in every possible sense of the word. Cheated out of a wedding, cheated out of the first two weeks of the honeymoon, cheated out of a relationship that hinted at so much promise yet managed to under deliver, cheated out of plotting and conflict and other writing techniques that were under-executed or done ineffectively, and cheated out of hours upon hours of my life.<br /><br />Conflict avoidance has reached near panic level. Sure, conflict was there, but I had to dig for it like I was shoveling for my own grave, and then I was going to be tossed in afterwards with my hands zip-tied behind my back and spitting up dirt. Jack popped in for a brief interlude, after the conductor had already waved his magic wand, and Leila (who was probably consuming massive amounts of happy pills) and Elena, aka Mrs. Robinson, were literally nowhere to be found, unless a brief reference is counted as full-fledged character development. Yeah, I must have missed that memo in Writing 101. But Christian managed to nearly drink himself to death once he found out Ana was pregnant, so that could be construed as conflict, if that's all you really have to work with.<br /><br />If you're willing to suspend disbelief (and I mean really suspend it to teenage hormonal fantasy level), then the sex scenes work perfectly. So at least E.L. James has that going for her.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatorthan the Euphrates and comes on command.

B00B1C39AY|3.0|The A side is definitely growing on me.  Too bad the video is no help.  Looking forward to the new album but fearing it may be another collection of ballads.  Mode needs to get back to the more driving rhythms they used to be known for.  The B side is great!
B007L5GDGW|1.0|I don't like this game at all. It was too hard to move the ball in the direction I wanted it to go. Definitely disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was pure pornography.  I felt &#34;dirty&#34; reading it and just kept perusing it to see if there was a real story there  I would not waste my money on the other two books.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I always find great deals on amazon, but finding my daughter's favorite movie for $5 (at the time) was the best! This is a super cute movie that 1 year olds can enjoy and laugh at and dance to, and after about 500 viewings mom ISN'T ready to break the tv. Great family movie
B001AVCFK6|5.0|one of the best movies of all time, the cast is awesome and right....this made it all the more real
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Over the years Ken Follett has written dozens of amazing books.  Like legions of others, I was consumed by Pillars of the Earth.  I thought I would never find another that would come close.  Then I read World Without End - even better because it told me more about the lives of the people in medieval England.  Again, I wondered when I would find another that was so enthralling.  Needless to say, I enjoyed The Fall of Giants that portrayed the lives of five very different and interesting families caught up in the events all over Europe during the World War I era. Just when I thought I couldn't wait any longer for another &#34;Follett Fix&#34; I pre-ordered Winter of the World.  From the first pages I could see how he was going to bring those same five families back into the story.  This book was an amazing accomplishment in terms of it range and scope. Follett continues to be a master storyteller. Now - how long do I have to wait for the third book in the trilogy?
B003FIUTA0|5.0|this is a great great movie! So glab I bought it. A must have for your collection. Price was unbeatable

Whew ok so it was heartbreaking gut wrenching and totally angst worthy. I thought at some points I wasn't able to continue because of the content however I pushed through it and I am so incredibly happy I did. The relationship between sky and dean was beautiful, chaotic, and humbling. I was so freaking sick of her father and disgusted.<br /><br />Overall the story is a must read and I'm so glad I finally got my hands on it. Oh yeah if you can't handle disgusting perverted freaks maybe this isn't the book for you. Just saying however it's worth it if you can stomach some scenes

B000NH7SZ0|5.0|This memory works in the Brother HL-6180DW laser printer, increasing its memory from the standard 128MB to the maximum 384MB.  The upgrade took about 5 minutes.<br /><br />To install the memory, turn off the printer.  Then, remove the rectangular plastic piece on the left side of the printer (opposite the side with the power switch).  Afterwards, remove the thin metal plate.  Making sure the notch at the bottom of the memory is on the left side, insert the memory at a 35-45 degree angle into the slot.  Replace the plate and plastic cover.<br /><br />Verify the printer now has 384MB memory by using the LCD or by going to the printer's web page.

B005LAIHY0|1.0|This movie was so freakin bad I felt obligated to IMMEDIATELY post a one star review! What a plotless mindless mess from the start! I've watched better Dr. Who episodes back in 1979. This blu ray was removed and sealed in the Netflix envelope after one hour of viewing. You have been warned!!!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious.  Rebel Wilson is HILARIOUS!  Anna Kendrick is great.  All of the actors are so diverse and do a great job.  The acapella singing throughout the movie is so unique and fun to listen to.  You'll be singing along, too.  A great storyline that's a bit different than the norm.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Game app loads fast no hic ups.. reminds me of Mar**  world. Can't wait for the third but this one is plenty fun

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It was suspenseful. It was a little out there in some parts (aliens?). I am ready for the next season whatever they bring. They just have a way to make it creepy. That means they are goign to cancel it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love the Nicholas Sparks books and movies  because he keeps your interest. A wonderful writer and the movie was great
0143143492|5.0|I hate self-help books, almost as much as I hate reviewers who preface their reviews of self-help books with \\"I hate self-help books.\\" I'm sick and tired of hearing the latest tips and tricks to \\"being your best,\\" or the surefire system to success that \\"worked for millions... so why not me?\\" Life is too short to analyze it for shortcuts, and that's exactly the point that Tolle makes in A New Earth. Tolle's thoughts are not original, of course; he borrows from teachings over 2,000 years old, the same timeless teachings that both Jesus Christ and the Buddha revealed to the world.<br /><br />The method to \\"awakening to your life's purpose\\" is absolutely simple. There are no steps, no ranks, no order of operations. The only thing you must do is to be present in this very moment. In doing so, you become aware of all the things you are not, and then you begin to realize your own true self. Try to \\"awaken,\\" or to become an \\"awakened one,\\" and you will struggle in vain. In the words of Christ: \\"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.\\" (Matthew 16:25)<br /><br />There's no need to buy this book if all you want to know is how to live. But if you want to hear more about what the world's greatest teachers had to say about this point, and about Tolle's own struggles from a young, frustrated academic to a content spiritual teacher (as well as the struggles of his students), the book offers an excellent cursory glance at topics many spend a lifetime contemplating. Tolle repeats himself often, which I initially found to be annoying, but came to appreciate once I realized that every time I thought I \\"got it,\\" I was still grasping at thin air. He essentially echoes the same teaching throughout, using different examples from history or from his own life. Some of the directions in which he went were a bit too new-agey for my tastes, but he's always very calm and down-to-earth, even when discussing lofty and esoteric concepts.<br/><br />Tolle might be the world's biggest con man, but I would venture a guess that he does, in fact, practice what he preaches, and is not ostentatious at all about it. His casual, self-deprecating attitude can be alarming to readers who are used to today's confident, out-spoken, and self-entitled \\"spiritual teachers.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book to those who, like me, want to end to their obsessive hoarding of self-help tips and tricks. If you can honestly grant this book your full attention, you won't need to turn to any more books, CDs, or web sites to become the productive, genuine individual that you always were. You'll stop spending your time trying to be excellent, and in doing so, become excellent. Does it sound too good to be true? I implore you to see for yourself.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I liked the game but I felt it was a bit short. I thought it would have extras. Overall it was a good play.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|Good, but not as good as the book!  Read the book first!  The movie provides glamorous images of a growing skyline.
B00992CF6W|4.0|for some reason my survival turned into creative and my maps got messed up sombody help me please this is so weird.
B0089AF2DS|4.0|With Yellow & Green, Baroness continue their progression from hard-line dirty sludge metal to a more experimental yet accessible progressive rock. However, the sonic leap is much wider than the one from Red Album to Blue Record (their first two albums, Y&G being their third), which might leave some fans scratching their heads instead of banging them.<br /><br />The band has shed their original hard-line dirty sludge metal sound, turning now to a more experimental, yet more accessible, progressive one. If you've never heard Baroness before, this is the album to get. However, I hesitate to recommend this to the more hardcore set who are expecting a harder, more refined version of the first two albums. The production quality has certainly improved, and the band members' focus, despite losing their dedicated bassist, is as precise as ever. But in improving their overall sound and playing, they've lost the rough edges that first drew my attention to them.<br /><br />Now, I don't think that Baroness consciously is trying to become more &#34;accessible&#34; by purposefully watering down their sound to garner more record sales. I believe that Baroness is still the honest bunch of Virginians that I first met, with the same high degree of talent and dedication as before. They're going to make the kind of music that beckons them at this point in their growth. It remains to be heard if this poppier, radio-friendly sound points to the band's destination, or is simply an awkward teenage phase in a larger lifecycle.<br /><br />On the album itself: its first of two parts, &#34;Yellow&#34; is the stronger of the two, with more memorable songs and a more cohesive feel across songs. I can't discount &#34;Green&#34; entirely, though, as it has my favorite track of them all, &#34;The Line Between.&#34; And what an appropriate title indeed, for a band that finds itself standing in the line between its heavy metal roots and its progressive leanings. Whereas the album's other songs make adecided step into the realm of the latter, &#34;The Line Between&#34; really does stand in the line between poppy hooks and fat riffs, proggy explorations and unwavering focus.<br /><br />I'm eager to hear what the band puts out next, but I hope that they continue to walk this line.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I Had no idea of what to expect and was pleasantly surprised!!! Cannot wait to read the next book in the series!
B000002GZ1|5.0|That was what it said in the little box. It was the first time I had seen that on an album jacket. The same admonition appeared on the cover of Truth by the Jeff Beck Group, which was a little more understandable, since Beck was known for his 'heavy' guitar style. The original LP had a dry sound that I really liked, especially as regards Butterfield's harp, which sounds a lot like Big Walter Horton, as I recently discovered. If you want to hear the resemblance check out Chicago: The Blues Today, vol. 3.<br /><br />This was the first electric blues album to find a white hippie audience and one of the best. In his day Michael Bloomfield was America's answer to Eric Clapton, and Paul Butterfield was a charismatic singer and guitarist. These guys also just looked cool, as you can see from the cover photo. The liner notes were pretty embarrassing if lovably so: hey, at least they HAD liner notes in those days.<br /><br />This album, Butterfield's first, contains a very strong set of songs and features the best Bloomfield to be found. His breaks on Born in Chicago, Shake Your Money Maker, and Look Over Yonder's Wall are dazzling. Though I'll concede he did some great stuff backing Dylan. If you just want one album by this group or as a sampler of Bloomfield's playing, this is the one, by far.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've watched the DVD multiple times already.  It was fun threatening my two sisters who are also fans of the show with details of episodes that they hadn't watched yet; they were both watching it when it was broadcast on Sundays.  I'd say, \\"Do you want to know what happens in this coming Sunday's episode?\\" Neither of them did, but I could have blurted out the suprises, not asked them if they wanted to know.  The teasing was all in good fun; I'm not that much of a meany.... I wish we didn't have to wait 10 months for Season 4.  But I have all 3 seasons on DVD, so I can occasionally bring them out and watch them again for the umpteenth time while I wait for Season 4.<br /><br />By the way, I have read some of the 1-star comments and they don't like the fact that Julian Fellowes killed off Matthew at the end of Season 3.  The reason this was done is because Dan Stevens, the actor who portrays Matthew, did not agree to return for Season 4.  He wanted to move on to other things in his acting career. That left Lord Fellowes with 2 choices - either bring in another actor to play Matthew who may or may not look like Matthew/Dan Stevens and who may or may not have the same \\"chemistry\\" with Mary/Michelle Dockery, or end the character.  He chose to end the character.<br /><br />There also is discussion in other reviews about the fact that the DVD verson (\\"the original UK edition\\") is not EXACTLY what was shown on PBS.  The reviewers are berating Amazon for this change.  I bought the Season 1 and Season 2 DVDs at Sam's Club and bought Season 3 from Amazon.  All 3 are \\"the original UK edition.\\"  So, it's not Amazon's fault that the PBS and DVD editions are slightly different.  It's just the way it is.  If you are hoping for an American version DVD, you'll wait forever.  Buy the UK editions and enjoy the show, however slightly different the versions may be from what was shown on PBS.

B008L1F91A|5.0|I'm a fan of the Kotobukiya line of figures so when Superman came out I was pretty pleased. Everything about this figure is good except for one thing, his face. This is not to say the face is bad, it's not, but you might be taken back by it's very \\"boyish\\" look. From a distance on a shelf it's not even noticeable and considering how incredible the rest of him is it won't take away from the figure. I just wanted to warn people ahead of time to take a good look at his mug before dropping that much $$. The magnetic stand is brilliant.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]Subway surfers is an all out addicting game the only problem I have with it is there needs to be an easier way to earn gold because I cant even tell you how much time I have spent on this game going on several run of a million and there just isn't enough income in my oppinion but that's my little bit of talking.... Thanks for such an awesome<br />Game[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|gave it a 5 because I enjoyed the various adventures<br /><br />Found the characters so different from my childhood wizard and the various lands most interesting
1401322786|5.0|Another great story by Mitch Albom. Not as easy to get into right away, but keep going it's a great and easy read.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|The love story of Elizabeth and Darcy is like an old friend.  Even if you have not read it in years, you can pick up without missing a beat.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So far I really like this app.  The &quot;tag&quot; based design seems more efficient than the folder structure.  The web clipped add on is really a nice touch.  Finally, being cloud based let's me have it all with me no matter the platform.  I'm still learning, but so far so good.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|My doctor is doing a long term study on the New Atkins approach, and is raving about the results. It is supposedly now the primary progran that Kaiser Permanate recommends. Great book!
0765325950|5.0|What a book! After more than 20 years of reading this story, I had built some pretty lofty expectations for it's eventual climax. This book exceeded those expectations.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want this game really bad and wish the price could go down a little but this game looks awesome forever
B008TSVZHM|5.0|This releases the msd cards easily but holds them in well until you want them.  I love the space provided for labeling what is on each card.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing amazing amazing amazing ok it gets a bit hard but it is such a good game.<br />the hover boards are awesome 5 star game
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Understanding the Era in which Tess takes places, it showed how live of the middle/poor class women can end up. It shows what was socially acceptable between Men and Women. Gemma Arterton does an excellent job and would love to see more of her.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|This is one of those albums that I can set to play and not have to worry about skipping over any of the tracks because I love them all. I love Coldplay's sound and Chris Martin's voice is so easy on the ears. Great album.
0307592731|5.0|An excellent &#34;journey&#34; tale.  Strayed's voice is true and vibrant. She's never self-pitying as she shares some very raw moments in her life.  You'll feel her triumph.
145210655X|5.0|Put it to you this way: I've bought 8 copies thus far. Every time I remember someone else who is a Star Wars fan, I buy another. And as much as it broke my heart to do so, I gave away the first copy I'd bught for myself because I knew the recipient would get just as much enjoyment out of it as I would have. It's not at all expensive - especially not when compared to the level of joy it brings everyone who has gotten a copy from me.<br /><br />The smiles, the giggles, the utter, unadulterated, childish glee that this book brings is simply inconceivable!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Nothing new to networking or social discussion here. The threads get long, difficult to follow by participant like a too long and too windy road to nowhere.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|If you've played one version of this type of game, you've pretty much played them all. There's nothing uniquely special about this version (other than the price - I was able to pick it up when it was the free app of the day). It's your standard block moving game... rearrange the blocks to clear the puzzle and move onto the next. A great little game to pick up and tinker with for short periods of time while waiting for the train, bus, at the doctor's office, etc. This one is exactly what I expected it to be.
0446310786|5.0|I saw the movie, starring Gregory Peck, years ago and many times after, and was curious as to the book that started it all. The movie differs from the book on a few points, but reading the book enhances the experience of seeing such a classic movie.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The only bad thing I can say is that it's simply not enough! The second season was even better than the first and the third episode (which I've watched repeatedly) kills me every time!<br /><br />The production, the modernization of the stories, the actors, just... the high, high quality of this series is amazing. Cumberbatch and Freeman are spectacular and the supporting cast do not fall far behind.<br /><br />A must-have for anyone who enjoys a good story. An absolute requirement for any Holmesian. But be warned: It will leave you wanting for more!
B009MO57H6|2.0|I purchase this more out of completedness than joy.  The story is less than fulfilling and lacks a good flow.<br /><br />Also, I truly disliked the blue zombies.
B0011Z933S|5.0|Plans is a great album. There are few albums that I can sit down and enjoy in their entirety without feeling the need to skip over the &#34;dud tracks&#34; and this is one of them. Great from start to finish. Just awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Probably the best book I've ever read in my life... No other has ever topped this. I will definitely continue reading John Greene's books... but this... You never grow out of it. I want to find a guy like Gus and be so much like Hazel... this is another one of those books where you wish it was you in the position of the main character... I know she will die, and like Peter Van Houten's, An Imperial Affliction, I can already see an ending...
B004132HZS|5.0|Being a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes from my earliest days I was a little skepitcal when I first heard about a modernized series, but good heavens do I love the BBc and this production and the choice of actors. I'd seen Freeman previously in a few Brit films and I'd liked his acting, but Cumberbatch blew me away with his spot-on interpretation-portrayal of Sherklock. Bravo BBC!<br /><br />Buy it. Now. You won't regret it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book changed my whole perspective on patriotism and war.  Couldn't put it down.  God bless Chris Kyle, his family, and our soldiers.
B001230JXC|5.0|Depeche mode is awesome - from their electro sound to the messages their tracks convey, delivered in a vocal so smooth it melts like butter in your ears, thanks to the amazing Dave Gahan. DM has one of those unique sounds that is fitting for any mood: happy, sad, bored, whatever, and Violator is packed full of awesome tracks that do not disappoint. Just great stuff. Excellent album.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I finally got around to reading it since I was interested in reading the Human Division, but I wanted to read the first book in the series. This is destined to be a classic Science Fiction book in a few years, because it is a great story about a possible future where Old People can become soldiers to fight against the enemies of human colonies.  It is filled with classic science fiction, romance, and jokes.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is fun and easy for all ages. My 7 year old lives it. I love the colors associated with the game. Sound isn't too loud and not annoying.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is different than other kindle simulation games. Graphics are cool. You don't have to wait forever for buildings to develop or to move to the next level and it your energy seems to never run out. I like it! Super Fun!
B004159Y98|5.0|Damien Rice has a raw and hauntingly beautiful voice. In all fairness I wouldn't say I'm completely in love with every single track on this album but as a whole this album delivers. Great music.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game is fun! I find myself playing more than I should! The graphics are great and I love the music that accompanies it! Well done Rayman!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app so much. I am so much more relaxed and healthy now that I got this app.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry Goodkind is one of the best authors I've ever read and becoming my personal favorite.<br /><br />I could read this book a thousand times and still laugh, cry and bite my nails just as hard!!<br /><br />I Definitely recommend reading this great book and all the ones after it!!!!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is such a fun game. I was sucked in as soon as I realized I'd be drawing my own character in the game. I'm not the best artist in the world but anybody can draw a stickman. This one plays without issue on my Galaxy S3. Great game!
0307744434|5.0|The incredible and vivid imagery painted by this novel is awe-inspiring.  The amazing layering of the story is so rich that you become immediately enthralled.  Absolutely phenomenal on all dimensions.  A must read for anyone looking to be transported to a magical world.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|I live in a small flat and the distance from the Kinect to the couch/wall is less then 3m. The product description says it'll reduce up to 40% in distance needed up to the Kinect. With my math it does about 20-25%. Not what they advertise but good enough for me.<br />Before having it installed I could only play single player and had to stick to the wall. Now 1 person can move around quite a bit and even 2 players can be detected OK.<br />An overall good product for those that simply don't have the required distance to the Kinect sensor.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I like the game when I get to play it, it has trouble loading sometimes but it is a good game.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I absolutely love Tom Hanks and if I had to pick a favorite it would probably be this one. Sally Field is great in this as well but it's Tom who really makes it shine. He does a phenomenal job of playing Forrest Gump, an Alabama man whose life is chronicled from childhood through adulthood as he faces many challenges and experiences many triumphs. The movie is funny at times, heartwarming at others, and truly entertaining from start to finish. All around an excellent film.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book did hold my interest.  However, I did find contradictions in the plot that were not explained reasonably  in the book.  I was able to predict the ending about half way through the novel.  No one's life could possibly be this dysfunctional.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|It's rare for me, having paid for a streaming film, to turn it off halfway through.  But halfway was already too far.<br /><br />I now understand why most of the audience at the film's premier in Cannes walked out.  The screenplay is awful, the cinematography is cramped and nauseating and the acting is terrible.  I am a huge Phillip Seymour Hoffman fan, but he just seemed constipated.  And Joaquin Phoenix' performance was nothing but petty anger and distorted grimaces.<br /><br />I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this mess.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game makes u want to play more and more. Then u unlock different characters that r fast and each month has a different place to go to. Each place has a special board and character.It's a perfect game for little kids ,adults anyone who likes a different version of temple run.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|EDGE Extended is a typical puzzle game built on a pretty simple concept. If you're into these types of games you'll find this one to be fun and addicting. You're basically pushing a cube around a geeked out course, collecting cubes and trying not to fall off the edges. The graphics are great and gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. I love the plethora of levels offered and how they increase in difficulty as you progress through the game. I enjoy passing the time with this one on my Galaxy S3.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|My Dad used to read these stories to me when I was a kid -- thought this Complete Sherlock Holmes would be a great, and inexpensive, addition to my Kindle library.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This is defiantly worth my money. Great price too! It came right on time like it said it was going to and it was fantastic!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book with all of it's twists and turns.  The ending surprised me.  I usually like a story line where there is a resolution for justice that's why I only gave it four stars.  It had nothing to do with the overall plot.  I would recommend it to others.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This one won't make you the next Rubinstein by any means but it's really fun to tinker around with. The &#34;notes&#34; fall vertically and as they reach the keyboard you simply touch the keys below them to make music. I'm a bit of a music geek and I love holiday music so this one is a home run for me. Great app.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The range on these is quite good.  I can take a phone call (RC) and walk around the house hands free and get a bite to eat (about 30 ft at least).  Battery lasts quite long as well, and it is comfortable to wear.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I want to have this game, but it wont install on my kindle fire!  if if they fix it I will definetly give a better rating.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|consume it multiple times on a regular basis. great blend of analog and digital. Dare I say radiohead-esque? whatever is said, it's crazy good.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I think by now most of us are at least familiar with Sudoku. If you've ever played Sudoku this game is guaranteed to please. It takes basic Sudoku and amps it up with a plethora of variants, levels, and features. Personally I find the game of Sudoku to get somewhat boring after a while but the variety offered in this game keeps it interesting. Great app!
B00A85EMVK|2.0|Excited to see one of my favorite movies come out in Blue-Ray 3D.  Watched it in 3D and found the 3D effects were okay but the video to be very grainy. My husband says I'm always too critical but this time he agreed with me. Didn't watch the 2D version that was included.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Such a wild experience watching this show. Never know what to expect. Love it. Jessica Lang is awesome. Cast is extremely talented.
B00005JK8K|5.0|I had it and bought another for a relative that wasn't aware of it.  He thought it was great.  We have American Indian in our heritage. Excellent story and very true.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I was fortunate enough to snag this gem when it was FAOTD but in my opinion it's definitely worth the asking price of 5 bucks. World of Goo is one of those puzzle games that's built on a simple concept but you find yourself sucked in and you can't put it down. Who knew building random structures out of globs of goo could be so fun? Great game.
1400069289|5.0|From reading one star reviews only, I wold have bought and gave this book a thorough read. One stars equate to very intelligent morons in this case. Probably cannot see through the daft egocentric sunshades they wear.<br />This is the most interesting review of human behavior I have read in years. Excellent case studies and reference to supporting documentation. Concise yet enough information to spark interesting reading unlike long winded medical journals. Second time through was even mo better!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is truly an easy game and yet so much fun that I have put it on both my Kindles.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I wish this story was a little longer to enjoy. Good short story by a great writer for any one.
B006O3MU96|5.0|If you've played Doodle Jump, put on your hat and scarf for this snow-covered version of a great game! There's really nothing new about this one, it's basically just Doodle Jump Christmas style. Still, if you're into Doodle Jump and you've got some Christmas spirit, this is an enjoyable way to pass the time. Personally I love Christmas time and really enjoy this festive version of one of my favorite games.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but this cd is a really good album! Was not disappointed in any of the songs
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think this is a good app. It gives<br /> you a lot of info about your battery and a lot of other stuff! You can change the color of the battery and the colors are so pretty and bright! I really like this app!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Great adaptation from the book. It is my favorite version of Emma. BBC  did a great job on this one.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|First of all, the graphics in this game are beautiful. This game delivers a surprising amount of substance in the storyline and game play. The game is a bit challenging at times but that's what makes it fun, in my opinion. Definitely worth the small asking price. Great game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm so happy I love this game it's awesome!!!! If I die, I don't care. I get mystery boxes every run.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|My husband has watched all of the bond movies but this is my first. He usually has trouble following the story line but we both followed and enjoyed this movie.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|LOVE , LOVE, LOVE!!! Bought this for my husband and son ....they both love it!  Highly recommend it to all Sinatra fans!!!
0307352153|4.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain is an excellent book. I felt like it described my life and self so perfectly. I was so excited to find a book solely dedicated to the study of introverts. This book reads like a mix between a textbook and a fast paced novel - it was packed full of intellectual information with a mix of exciting and compelling personal stories.<br /><br />The book touches on the traits of an introvert, differences between introversion and shyness, the business world, history, science, children, education, and much, much more. She mentions this book took seven years to write and you can definitely tell by the amount of research that went into it.<br /><br />Quiet is a jam packed 352 page book which also includes notes, an index, a quiz to determine where you fall on the introvert/extrovert scale, Q&A with the author, resources, discussion questions, and more.  I absolutely recommend this book for all introverts, plus parents or spouses of introverts. You won't regret reading it.<br /><br />My only \\"complaints\\" about this book would be the sometimes pretentious writing - it talks frequently about fancy dinner parties, attorneys, high powered consultants, etc, etc. It's obvious the author comes from a rather different circle of life than this middle class stay at home mom! Also, I'm confused as to why this book is being promoted by a Christian publisher - it is not by any stretch of the imagination a religious book and I'm not even sure if the author is a Christian. It also has some infrequent language. However, this wouldn't cause me not to read the book - I just thought it was a bit odd.<br /><br />All around, read this book!<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story is amazing.  I love this time period.  The actors are perfect.  I can't wait to watch season 3!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Saw my nephew playing this game on his tablet, so I downloaded it and no regrets! This is one quick easy but very fun game to buy
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book surprised me by being quite a bit more engaging than I expected.  In terms of actual &#34;action&#34; in this book, there's not a lot going on.  Nevertheless, it is well-written enough and the characters engaging enough that I found myself eager to read more chapter after chapter.  I found the transition between the almost-goofy &#34;present day&#34; action and the extremely dark flashback chapters to be jarring, almost like I was reading two different books, but maybe that's part of what held my interest.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was a very funny movie. I personally think it's the best Men In Black that has been released. I hope they make more of them.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|Who among us doesn't want to be remembered? To make an impact that will last lifetimes? It turns out everyone's life does, just not necessarily the way you might like or to the degree you might hope, or so says this latest offering from the creators of The Matrix trilogy based on a novel of the same name by David Mitchell.<br /><br />  Chronologically, the first character we're introduced to is Adam Ewing. Ewing (played by Jim Sturgess) is an American lawyer travelling to the South Pacific to conduct business on behalf of his father-in-law. He witnesses the enslavement of the native islanders, offers passage to one who stows away on the ship, Autua (played by David Gyasi) and falls ill as a result of exposure to a parasite. Once incapacitated by his illness, Ewing is \\"cared for\\" by the maniacal Dr. Henry Goose (played by Tom Hanks). Eighty-seven years later, we're taken to the UK and introduced to a young man whose wealthy father sees him as an embarrassment and has disowned him. That man, Robert Frobisher (played by Ben Whishaw), dreams of being a composer. While hoping to achieve that, he takes a job dictating for a man whose already achieved fame of his own, Vyvyan Ayrs (played by Jim Broadbent), whose eyes are failing him. Despite Ayrs unpleasant demeanor, Frobisher proves up to the job and it allows him time to further his own ambitions. Flash forward another thirty-seven years, we meet Luisa Rey. Rey (played by Halle Berry who also portrays relatively minor characters in the previous storylines) is a second-generation journalist writing a story about a nuclear power plant that is opening in her hometown of San Francisco. Unexpectedly, she meets Rufus Sixsmith (former lover of the now-deceased Frobisher played by James D'Arcy). Sixsmith (D'Arcy) is a nuclear physicist who knows that the plant is unsafe and hopes to relay his knowledge to Rey and provide evidence to substantiate it. What neither Ray, Sixsmith, or Dr. Isaac Sachs (another whistleblower played by Tom Hanks) are aware of however, is that they are all being hunted by a man whose employers wish to see the plant open, no matter the risk to the environment or local residents. Once again, we jump ahead. This time, thirty-nine years to the present. There we meet Timothy Cavendish (played by Broadbent). Cavendish is a publisher at a publicity event for an author named Dermot Hoggins (Hanks). During the event, Hoggins sees a critic who panned his work and throws him off the balcony. While he is sent to jail for his actions, his book begins flying off the shelves resulting in a financial windfall for Cavendish. Members of the Hoggins family wish to take the proceeds Cavendish is receiving from the sales as a result of Dermot signing away his rights to them before going to jail. Cavendish goes on the run and his brother Denholme (played by Hugh Grant who, like the others, played roles of varied significance in the previous stories) sends him to an establishment that he mistakes for a hotel but that is, in fact, a secure home for the elderly. Rather than capitulate, Cavendish plots his escape with help from other unhappy residents, one of whom only says two words over and over during the planning of the escape and the escape itself.<br /><br />  There are two more storylines which, together, span a time of two-hundred nine years into the future. Rather than describe them both, I'll simply conclude here with my thoughts on the film as a whole. Cloud Atlas, while not as brilliant as the hype made it out to be, is a great film. Hanks and company play all of their roles expertly. And though the connective tissue between them strains credulity at times, they each leave the viewer with a sense of hope and optimism that, in the end, things will work out somehow. That's not a large part of my particular worldview, but it's beautifully depicted and highly entertaining, nonetheless.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I thought the opening of the film was excellent, but as the movie progressed I became bored with it, it just wasn't what I expected. There are far to many movies with the same plot.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Never liked a movie as much as this.  Totally bittersweet and redemptive.  Judgement vs Grace.  I've seen it four times and it still has not gotten old.  Just listening to the music makes me cry.  My two sons, 13 and 11 have seen it three times and love the music.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Have you ever seen someone who you know deserved to rot in jail get away with it? What if they somehow wound up committing the exact same crime? Could you let them get away with that a second time? I doubt it.<br /><br />  When we first join the characters, we find ourselves in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A sniper attack ends the lives of five seemingly random people. With an abundance of evidence against him, the police arrest and charge former Army sharpshooter James Barr (played by Joseph Sikora). Rather than confess and throw himself on the mercy of the court, the way District Attorney Alex Rodin (played by Richard Jenkins) and his lead investigator, Detective Emerson (played by David Oyelowo) would like, he writes \\"find Jack Reacher\\" on a piece of paper and that's the last we hear from him for sometime. Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise) is a former military police officer who served with distinction and all but vanished from the earth once he left the service. The D.A. and lead investigator ask how they're supposed to find someone like that and just as one of the characters says \\"you don't find him, he finds you\\" he shows up at their office. By this time, perhaps as a result of misconduct on the part of police and prison officials, James Barr is in a coma. His lawyer, Helen Rodin (defense attorney and daughter of the District Attorney played by Rosamund Pike) introduces herself to Jack Reacher and asks him to work as her investigator. Reacher tells Rodin how he and Barr first became acquainted. Barr, a sharpshooter who never fired a single shot during a battle scenario, has been trained for a task he was never ordered to attempt. He, out of desperation, kills several men who are completely unknown to him. As it turns out, those men were civilian contractors and Barr killed them as they were concluding a rape rally. Barr was acquitted and Reacher, certain he will commit a similar crime in the future, vowed to be there when he did.<br /><br />  I wouldn't call myself a Tom Cruise fan. I've seen films he was in that I liked (examples include A Few Good Men, the Mission: Impossible series, and Collateral) and I've seen him in movies I hated (Knight and Day, War of the Worlds, Vanilla Sky). I would consider myself a Rosamund Pike fan; however I have only seen two other films in which she appeared (Die Another Day and The Big Year). I wouldn't call Jack Reacher a masterpiece or some sort of reemergence of Cruise's career, but it was very entertaining and I'm glad I saw it.

0375869026|5.0|I highly recommend this book! I bought it for my daughter's classroom. She is a 6th grade teacher who recommended it to me. It's a heart warming story about a boy who overcomes challenges that most of us cannot imagine.  It left me with renewed faith in humanity's goodness.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Funniest movie I've seen in a long time! Not really a chick flick and thank goodness it's not really a musical.

B0064HJX56|3.0|maybe I find sequels not quite as good as the first, it's enjoyable but loss some of its magic. if you loved the first book still worth a read.  I am not a teenager so maybe a bit over the sequels that drag out a good story.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|Fits my Kindle Fire very snug.  Doesn't affect the speakers, although it does cover them slightly.  I like to run my fingers across it and feel the letter impressions.  It looks beautiful, very appealing and I have received several compliments on it.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|OK so not really worth the price if your favorite of the 4 movies is Crystal Skull... get your brain examined please... the Transfers look great and I am truly happy with the films... even crystal skull. At least it isn't as bad as episode I &#34;Phantom plot&#34;... I mean Menace. Any who if you enjoy a little hilarity with your archeological digs you gotta grab this one up.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|The app temple run was a huge hit! And now it is back for temple run 2! Now you can go on ropes, mine carts, and get special powers for each character! Temple run 2 is truly the best! :)
B008XG1X18|2.0|I am sure this product has been a joy for many, but I found it too convoluted and difficult to navigate.  There may be a time in the future I will have more time to investigate, but for now, I have deleted it from my Kindle.
