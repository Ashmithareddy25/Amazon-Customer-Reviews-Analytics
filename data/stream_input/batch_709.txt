0316010669|3.0|Once again, Malcolm Gladwell has written a series of intriguing chapters on the human decision-making process, but without a unifying principle--and that's hard to find with such a fiendishly complex topic--it doesn't hang together as a book. The book felt too long as I waded through a number of real life situations without a punch line; at the same time the book felt way too short to adequately cover some of the issues raised. The chapter on the Iraq war games was fascinating and scandalous--did the Pentagon really rig the game to produce a stated result? (I guess I shouldn't be surprised!) There's a great book there alone. Another example was the tragic Amadou Diallo killing in NYC several years ago--Gladwell's treatment of this tragic and complex event seemed superficial and unoriginal.     I had the same problem with \\"The Tipping Point.\\" Gladwell writes very well, but he's more the journalist than analyst. He has good points, although not new ones--we often make decisions at lightning speed for reasons we don't understand; too much data can overwhelm; words rarely convey the full meaning of what a person is thinking and feeling at any one time; much, if not most, of communication is non-verbal. But you can't fit all of that into one book.
B000000W94|5.0|This is an incredible album. I have nothing to add but that \\"Black Magic Woman\\" (which was recently -and brilliantly- covered by Snowy White (also a Peter Green fan, and also from Thin Lizzy) and \\"Green Manalishsi\\" (which was metalized by Judas Priest whom I bet most of you don't like.) But Gary has a flair for Metal, and I wonder how this one would've sounded like.
B000002J0N|5.0|CSN (1977) was a comeback album of sorts from the recently sober trio of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. With a Rolling Stone cover story and much anticipation, CSN roared out of the gates with two hit singles, Just A Song Before I Go and Fair Game.<br /><br />CSN is one of Crosby, Stills & Nash's best two or three albums, right up there with their self-titled debut,  [[ASIN:B000002J0P Crosby, Stills & Nash]], and [[ASIN:B00000DOZP Daylight Again]]. The album was very well produced, and the production highlights the crisp acoustic sound of the intelligent and well balanced songs.<br /><br />Graham Nash shines brightly with his piano based ballads, Carried Away, Cold Rain, the epic Cathedral, and his guitar ballad Just A Song Before I Go.<br /><br />David Crosby's Anything At All and In My Dreams are both mellow and thoughtful acoustic guitar gems, and his Shadow Captain opens the album with an easy, harmonious vibe.<br /><br />Stephen Stills contributes some very good acoustic guitar tunes with the Latin-influenced Dark Star, Carribean-influenced Fair Game and the love song, See The Changes. His electric guitar rockers, Run From Tears and I Give You Give Blind are also very good.<br /><br />In all, the album is thoughtful, mellow and balanced. The music sounds fresh and relaxed, and all three members of the group sound clearheaded and healthy.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|One can't help getting the impression that your commentator did not understand Stay. In my opinion Forster&Benioff produced a  remarkable piece of art, cinema at its best, in the tradition of Godard as much as in Lynch's. Managing to implement the very essence of cinema as art form, they carry out a wonderful de-construction of space-time to mould these, coordinates of our experience (the reference to Kant does not need to become explicit), into an entirely different conceptual level in which one can not expect dialogs to play the same role they play in Hollywood blockbusters. They are analytical units in which crucial ideas are presented: the subjective nature of reality; enlightenment as becoming aware of the illusory nature of our everyday space-time framed experience of reality  (what Leon realizes as he becomes able to see it!) and death as the ultimate instance of this overcoming space-time illusion; trust and dependability among persons as the most fundamental strata of reality; guilt as the inability to live in the present (as one remains trap in the past and projects oneself into a punishing future) open to the too much beauty around (to give up committing suicide); Eros&Tanathos providing the inspirational energy for the work of art .  References, verbal to Hamlet and to Buddhism and visual to Lope de Vega, locate the narrative into a subjective-but-truly-real realm in which the two main characters intermix as they interact. Both time and space are handled to the best of the possibilities opened by cinema as art form. Time is reconstrued connecting its units through wonderful camera language and reordering it into conveying those crucial ideas; space is aesthetically transformed both with an absolutely amazing use of architectural spaces (both interiors and public) of noticeable Escher inspiration and with swift shifts through time-sequences. In this way, movements through space via time sequences and through time via successive spaces are masterfully handled. Of course buying this remarkable piece of art cinema expecting to enjoy an amusing psychological thriller can only lead to disappointment and confusion.
0375812024|3.0|As in all Richard Scarry Books, this one has really cute and kooky pictures, but I was highly disappointed with the storyline.  A Day at the Firestation is SO much better!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is the Oscar-nominated comedy starring Abigail Breslin, Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, and Alan Arkin.  It's the American family road-trip movie for the current generation.  There was a lot of hype last year about this little-movie-that-could, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and none of it was undeserved.  Now on DVD, this film never ceases to entertain and delight.     The eccentric Hoover family from Alberqueque rallies around their awkward young daughter, Olive, who has been invited to compete in the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" pageant in California.  Mom, Dad, daughter and son, along with Grandpa and Uncle pile into their old yellow VW bus, which has seen better days, and go off to help Olive chase her dream of being a beauty queen.  The cast is an impeccable ensemble of Hollywood's relative newcomers and veterans, and legend-in-the-making Steve Carell, steals several scenes as Uncle Frank, the suicidal, homosexual Proust scholar.  Young Abigail Breslin really shines, though, and even earned an Oscar nod for her unforgettable performance.       Little Miss Sunshine seems mildly humorous, with spots of black humor and somber heart-warming moments, for the first three quarters of the film.  Then suddenly, without warning, it is uproariously funny, and stays that way until it fades to black.  When the film was first released to theaters, the audience would invariably be falling out of their seats, crying and laughing, as little Miss Breslin performed her \\"talent\\" in the pageant.  It truly is charming and warm and you do really fall in love with the characters, but the film offers so much more than just family dysfunction.  It's also a sharp satire of child beauty pageants.  The last scene, at the pageant, is the funniest scene in any film released last year.       The only thing that drags this little gem of a film down is the writing, and even that is easily overlooked.  But something about the way writer Michael Arndt set up each character for a rise and fall came off as a little cheesy.  It seemed just a little too much, especially when Dwayne, played by Paul Dano, found out he was color-blind.  In the end, though, fifteen minutes into the film later, all is forgotten, dissolved into hysterical laughter.     Little Miss Sunshine walks the delicate line of dark humor and family comedy with such precision and passion.  It's impossible to watch this film and not love it.  The DVD includes four alternate endings and director commentary, and the film is just as good on the second, third and fourth viewings, as it was on the first.
0780626966|4.0|I have been waiting to get this collection for ages as its not yet available in Australia. I must say i wasnt dissapointed. The additional \\"Nightmare Series Encyclopedia\\" is a must see for fans of the series. Who knew Robert Englund was not only a great actor but a genius. His insight into his character and the series of \\"Nightmare's\\" was a rare treat. I have to say all of the actors and directors interviewed on this excellent behind the scenes look were great to watch and all had something interesting to say. It seems not only were the cast there for the love of the franchise but the crew and especially the studio \\"New Line\\". The only studio in Hollywood that believed in Wes Craven's classic idea. The movies are all there from 1 through to 7. The transfers are great although the sound on some of the earlier disc's isnt up to scratch. Its forgiven, it was the 80's and the early movies were made on a shoe string budget. If you love \\"Nightmare on Elm St\\" this is a must have and the 3-D glasses are a blast for both young and old.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is Nikon's baby flash. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the larger, heavier, more sophisticated (and much more expensive) SB-600 or SB-800 flashes.<br /><br />What it does have is:<br /><br />It's small and light and low profile (you won't be as paranoid about busting it off like the big ones that stick way up in the air) so you'll be more likely to just leave it on the camera all the time instead of having to dig it out of the bag whenever you want to use it. It only takes 2 AA batteries so it's a lot lighter than the bigger units which take 4. It's very easy to install and use.<br /><br />I originally bought it for my D-50 and it worked fine on that and now on the new D-80 that I upgraded to. It also works on my little Nikon Coolpix P5000 which is really handy when I don't want to lug all the heavy iron.<br /><br />Oh yeah...the pics are a lot better than when using the built-in flash too. And you are less likely to get shadows when using a big lens hood.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is a great movie!!! I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good western. It is almost as good as Tombstone!
0061142026|5.0|I love Gaiman's style of writing, witty though quite serious at times. He remains descriptive without boring you with unneccesary details. His imagination is fantastic- this is a fantasy story unlike any other I've read!
B000G759LW|4.0|I have always like Christina.  Her cd's get better and better.  She is always reinventing herself and I like that.  You don't get the same thing all the time.  This cd was good.  You can't compare it to the other ones because it is totally different.  I can't wait to hear what she will have in the future.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I'm suprised at how much criticism there has been of this movie.  Entertainment Weekly gave it a C, reviewers here have made their complaints as well.  I'm not sure what people expect, but it is a made for T.V. movie that had a very short production deadline.  With that in consideration, I think they did an amazing job.  I give it five stars because there is so much positive about this and the first movie.  My daughters are 5 and 7 and they are beginning to get into some of the \\"tween scene\\" things.  HSM and HSM2 are movies portraying teenagers that are squeaky clean and pure.  The focus is on friendship, not the horny dating scene.  I don't have to explain anything inappropriate or too adult to them.  The music is catchy and I'm not embarassed to hear them sing adult lyrics that they don't understand.  I know my perspective doesn't match everyone else's, but as a parent, I can't say enough good about these two movies.  Speaking of the two movies, I think the second looks more professionally done and the songs are even more catchy.  The dance numbers are explosive.  I'm sure this version will be under our Christmas Tree and my husband and I will tire of hearing it over and over again, but they could choose much worse!  (I still can't believe that at their age, my friends and I were repeatedly watching Grease on VHS!  Talk about racy lyrics and situations!)  I would sleep a lot better in the next decade if high schoolers really were like they are in HSM and HSM2!
B000JJRIN4|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this album.  She went wierd for her last one, which was fine because I liked it.  I liked it a lot but this one it was like the same crap but not in a good way.  I think after maybe the 6th song I just can't listen to the album anymore.  So I basic like only 5 or 6 songs from the whole album.  I think I expected more.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|The Beatles movie \\"Help!\\" is by far the best Beatles movie.  People say that \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is but I absolutely love this one!! I can not wait for this deluxe boxed set arrives in stores cause I'm definatley going to buy it!!! I've seen it like 100,00 times and every time it just gets better anf better. The boxed set includes the 2 disc digitally remasterd movie with the soundtrack by 5.1 surround sound and the movie poster, lobby cards, a copy of the help script and a 60 page book with rare unseen photos with prduction notes. THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR ANY BEATLES FAN AND WITH WHAT APPLE CORPS AND EMI MUSIC DID TO THIS REMASTERED PROJECT, IS AMAZING!!!
B000H305U0|5.0|He is a great artist and he shows it in everyway in this album.  He is just great.  I love every song on this album.
B000VPUIA6|3.0|So for an extra $75 you get (in addition to the two DVDs):    * a reproduction of Richard Lester's original annotated script    * 8 reproductions of the original theatrical lobby cards    * a reproduction of the Theatrical movie poster    * a 60-page book with rarely seen photographs and production notes from the movie. Both the deluxe book and the standard booklet feature an introduction by Richard Lester and an appreciation by Martin Scorsese.    No doubt it's the book that bumped the price up so much. My rating is temporary, only because it's not out at the time I wrote the review. Most likely a nice (albeit pricey) holiday gift for the die hard Beatles collector.    Unanswered questions: why not a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD high-def release? What mixes are provided of the soundtrack? And why are LET IT BE and several other Beatles films still unreleased on home video (as of late 2007)?
B000P2A256|4.0|I think this Maroon 5 album is the best one so far.  I enjoyed the last one but this one is even better.  I was very happy with it.  It was worth the wait.
B000P2A256|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that Maroon 5 could follow up Songs For Jane with such an excellent cd. My wife and I loved every song on the playlist and we couldn't wait to add it to our Ipods. This was money well spent and I can't wait for their next cd. If you love Maroon 5 you have to have this cd.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|I loved Avril's last album.  It was so mature and the music was great.  I just feel like she went a step back with this album.  It was more kiddy like.  I still like the album some what but I don't see myself listening to this album over and over again like I did with the last one.
B00005RG6B|5.0|I got to see this live at a show that isn't on any tour listings.  It was the end of their european leg and they had a stop over on the east coast before heading back to Seattle.  It was the first time that I got to see the band live although my friends all saw them several times before (damn work)  This dvd let me relive the show when they were at their best.  With a surround system I could only have dreamed about sixteen years ago it's like I'm sitting in a darkened Centrum again.  I might even be in danger of wearing this dvd out.  Best way to experience the show today.
0446698326|2.0|I enjoyed most of the book until the ending.  It really ruined the book for me.  I wish I had never read it.  One could make the argument that the main characters' relationship would never have worked, but I disagree.  I did not think the ending was realistic.  Really, who would ever do what this character, John, did?  No way.  I am very disappointed.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|Very disappointed in my purchase.  The packaging was not as shown on the web site.  Disks were not in a organizer as shown on the web site but in cheep protectors and thrown randomly in a red box.  After some organizing, found two (?) disks were missing.  Site says it is a 45 disk set, but received only 42.  When vendor notified of missing disks, two replacement disks were sent and one was wrong. Still waiting for correct disks.  Both had different labels and ISRC numbers from the \\"collectors\\" set.  The set also did not contain the pamphlet that is shown on the web site.  This can not be considered collectors set.
B00005JPLW|2.0|If you're willing to put your brain in neutral, this might be an entertaining film. Call me an old-timer, but I miss the sweeping epics of Stanley Kubrick ('Spartacus') and Cy Endfield ('Zulu'). And after viewing this film, I can certainly understand the cries of those who were bothered by the movie's racist overtones: The Persians were depicted as everything BUT human.<br /><br />Zack Snyder is a talented director. Praise to him for being inventive and imaginative, and yes, this is historical fantasy, not a precise documentary, but in my opinion, he took far too much \\"artistic license\\" with this work. For starters, he tried too hard to make the movie look like Frank Miller's book. A big mistake, with many of the scenes filmed in this nauseating blend of full color and sepia tone. The movie is described as 'loosely' based on the Battle of Thermopylae, and the word loosely should be spelled with capital letters:<br /><br />The historical inaccuracies are numerous. Xerxes' Immortals are shown throwing what amounts to hand grenades. But the use of gunpowder did not come into widespread military use until the Northern Song dynasty in China, around 1044 AD, hundreds of years after Thermopylae. The Immortals are also shown wearing what appears to be chrome masks, a metal that would have been unknown then.<br /><br />The Persian army is shown using war elephants. While true they used them, it did not occur until later, particularly in their campaigns against Alexander the Great. And as far as the 'battle rhinoceros' is concerned, this was so ludicrous that it doesn't merit discussion.<br /><br />Then there is King Xerxes himself, depicted as a multi-pierced, gold chain wearing freak-slash-ghetto pimp daddy on a power trip. No wonder people of Persian decent were howling with anger upon seeing this film. Other Persians were shown as half monster/half human beings that simply did not exist then...or now. In one of the deleted scenes on the 2-disk set, Snyder talks about a scene involving giants with Persian archers on their backs. Snyder says the scene was cut from the final version because it was \\"into the stratosphere\\"..i.e., 'over the top'. Gee, no kidding. Like he hadn't done enough of that already??<br /><br />The stop-motion, accelerate/decelerate fight scenes are more annoying than entertaining. \\"The Matrix\\" meets history is not a good mix. And many of the battle sequences are too dark.<br /><br />As for the plus points, there's plenty of half-naked, well-muscled man candy to keep the giddy female viewers interested. Lots of cartoonish blood spattering, mindless violence (as war sometimes is) and a couple of scenes of gratuitous nudity for the guys. For a better review, read the one by Garrett Stiger. He hit the nail on the head for this movie.<br /><br />In a strange and ironic twist, Frank Miller, who wrote the graphic novel, was inspired by the 1962 film \\"The 300 Spartans\\" as a kid. For all of its corn and cheesy cold war overtones, this movie is still superior to \\"300\\".<br /><br />All in all, not a bad film. But a golden opportunity has been lost. Zack Snyder had a chance to make a spectacular historical epic, but instead made a busy, overly stylized film that twists an actual event into more fantasy than reality. This is history for the 'Gen-X' crowd....a generation of people with a culturally induced attention deficit disorder, where we no longer watch the news and absorb it, but have our brains bombarded with 10-second soundbites. The sort of people who'll enjoy this film....most of them good folks....are the ones who get bored easily. If there's not someone getting shot/naked/blown up every 15 seconds, they're ready to change channels or tune out.<br /><br />What a pity.

B000002UA9|5.0|Since the release of the Beatles' first-ever album, \\"Please Please Me\\", there's been scores of articles, interviews, etc., singing (pardon the pun!) the praises of this phenomenal four-man band.   But, do they deserve the credit? ABSOLUTELY!  And Ringo Starr must be the luckiest drummer on earth: On the eve of the signing for their first recording, he just happened to be available when original drummer Pete Best dropped out (old Pete must've been kicking himself for that!). Imagine, instead of those four familiar first names, the line-up might have been \\"John, Paul, George & Pete\\"?? It wouldn't have been the same.   This debut effort still has the raw performance flavor of their club days, head-bopping those mop-tops to good 'ol rock & roll. The rousing \\"And I Saw Her Standing There\\" kicks off the set, defying you not to dance around the room, as if firing the starting gun to a runaway smash career. Sandwiched between are some pleasing Lennon-McCartney collaborations (the title song, \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"P.S., I Love You\\", \\"Do You Want To Know A Secret\\"), indicating that the best was yet to come in future albums. Appropriately book-ending the album is the raucous \\"Twist And Shout\\", driven by Lennon's scorching vocals. So memorable a rock song is it that it inspired a moment from an 80's teen comedy (who can forget Matthew Broderick lip-synching to it atop a parade float in \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\"?).   A rousing & promising start to the greatest band ever.
0440236304|5.0|Very well written book, hard to put down, when reading book you feel like you are actually with the soldiers fighting in France.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This gets labelled as a guy movie all the time.  It's definitely one that's aimed toward guys but it's a sophisticated and well put together movie that I feel anyone could enjoy.  There's points in the movie that may be too 'touchy' for females but the story well then makes up for it.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into detail about the movie seeing as the number of review before mine that have, but I will go into detail about the DVD features.<br /><br />David Fincher knows how to put out DVDs, this, as well as [[ASIN:B000050FEN Seven (New Line Platinum Series)]], feature no less than 4 commentaries.  Also included are plenty of feautettes, deleted scenes, and behind-the-scenes footage.  The case is awesome just as well.  This is a must have.  It very well may be the best movie David Fincher ever directed.<br /><br />Must Have.
1400062756|2.0|Mindset makes the argument that people who believe they can improve themselves will be more likely to take chances and grow.<br /><br />There. I've said it. Now you don't need to read the book.<br /><br />The rest of the book consists of stories that illustrate the above idea.  Many many stories.  All with the same lesson.  The book is really a pamphlet.<br /><br />Also, I think the book is misleading.  The latest research shows that we all have strengths and weaknesses and that we do best when we leverage these natural abilities.  I think Mindset misses this point and, in fact, suggests the opposite.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0743201140 Now, Discover Your Strengths]] is a much better book for those seeking personal growth.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Martin Scorsese has a way with biopics.  Each one has been a masterpiece.  [[ASIN:B00062IVKS Raging Bull (Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:1559409037 The Last Temptation of Christ - Criterion Collection]], and [[ASIN:B000286RKW GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] are masterpieces and I feel THe Aviator ranks right up there with these.<br /><br />It's a wonderful movie.  Spectacular and grand in its scope.  The cast is brilliant and their acting is perfect.  Cate Blanchett steals the show as Katharine Hepburn, definitely and Oscar worthy performance.  Also are Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale, Jude Law, Gwen Stefani, and John C. Reilly.<br /><br />The film itself covers Howard Hughes life for 20 or so years.  It features his move to Hollywood, the making of Hell's Angels, and his entagles with both Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner.<br /><br />The DVD features an informative commentary with the man himself, Martin Scorsese, also included is one deleted scene, and a few featurettes, all of which are a must watch.<br /><br />Although a tad on the lengthy side (170 minutes!), this muvie is a very good movie.  I love it.  It's one of the best of the year.  Definitely recommended.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000VAPZM2|3.0|This review is based on the TV Premier<br /><br />I, like many other 42 year old middle aged males, waited with baited breath for this premier....wait a minute, scratch that! Okay, so it's my guilty little pleasure, and this film appeals mostly to young preteen females, but that's besides the point. I loved the first film with a passion. I am so glad they are doing so many spin-offs on this franchise.<br /><br />But I gotta tell you: this film was a stinkfest. Very cliched, very cheesy, very \\"obviously\\" falling into scenes which then had the obligatory songs. Etc. Etc.<br /><br />I also watched this on television first, unlike the first one, and was quite taken aback by the number of commercials and \\"extras\\" they threw in. How long was this movie? 1 hour and 10 minutes, 1 hour and 20 minutes? It seemed like there was around 40 minutes of breaks, etc. Was it just me?<br /><br />I will not buy this on DVD, at least at full price. I'm not even sure I'll buy it at a discount.<br /><br />Two thumbs down!<br /><br />MC White said: not recommended.
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is a perfect movie.  The casting is brilliant and the acting is just as wondeeful.  Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt star as cops after a serial killer killing in the style of the seven deadly sins.  The script is just as brilliant.    David Fincher put together one of the best movies in the last ten years.  It's atmospheric, creey, and genuinely terrifying.  A wonderful movie at that.    The DVD is one of the best ever released, four (4) total commentaries featuring any and everybody that worked on this film.  Also included are featurettes, deleted scenes, two alternate endings, and plenty of other features.    David Fincher has impressed me with his directing, [[ASIN:B00012FXB8 Alien 3 (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00003W8NM Fight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], and [[ASIN:B0001AVZCQ Panic Room (3-Disc Special Edition)]] were just as wonderful.    This is a definite Must Have.
0800141601|5.0|Loved this movie and I've watched it so many times. Great acting by Sean Connery and Richard Gere. All the knights of the round table carried themselves with dignity except the infamous Maligant-Ben Cross played the bad knight very well. You wont be dissapointed!
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is the best superhero show ever put on television and is one of the best TV shows on right now.  The writing is superb and the acting is wondeful.  Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor is the real star of the show.  he's perfect.  He gives Lex so many layers it's absolutely amazing.    From the start of the Pilot to the end of Tempest you'll love this show.  It's definitely one of the best.  My favorite show on TV right now.    Some of the best from the season include: Pilot, Hourglass, X-Ray, Rogue, Zero, Stray, Nicodemus, and Tempest.    Highly recommended.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is by far my favorite CD out of all her CD's. She has a lot of feelings and emotions she put into this CD
B00005V9HH|5.0|So many wonderful quotes in this movie.  It's a delight to watch.  The movie is cleverly plotted and stars a wonderful cast.  the highlight of the movie has to be Oscar winner Kevin Spacey.  He plays his part brilliantly well.    The DVD itself is also top botch, with two cmmentaries, a number of deleted scenes and some featurettes.  Definitely must have.
B000R8YC18|5.0|The thing that haunts \\"Taxi Driver,\\" even after all these years, is how connected a lot of the viewers feel with Travis Bickle, Vietnam veteran and burgeoning psychopath.  Is he really as different as we want him to be, or is he closer to who \\"we\\" are than we like?    The '70s, for all the talk of it being a cultural wasteland, was a wonderful time if you're a fan of movies.  The angst of Vietnam created a lot of worthy dramas and comedies.  Most of them were very grim, bitter, angry, and disillusioned, but then these qualities make for some fine reflection on the human condition.  As did the setting of the movie, which was New York.  I was a boy at the time, but my parents let me watch the news, as well as the TV of the era, and New York was a schizoid wonderland of success, excess, and the multiblock whore-with-a-heart-of-gold known as Times Square.  DeNiro's unraveling character is most at-home here, surrounded by people (the \\"scum\\" he hates so much, ironically) yet apart from them, without the first clue how to connect with him.  Is there anything more scary, with all the examples in the movie of Travis' decent into madness, than his perfectly-reasoned decision to take his \\"angel\\" on a date to a porno theater?    Robert DeNiro, already a veteran or soon-to-be-star of many classics of the period, owns Bickles' troubled soul and is thoroughly believable of a failed \\"hero.\\"  Its not so strange that the only time someone else truly connects with him is when they both have a sense of violent helplessness of their own situations, namely the grocer Travis saves by blowing the would-be robber of his store's brains out.    Martin Scorcese is also able to showcase what would be his greatest directorial skill in the low-budget limitation of the movie.  He is able to allow us to see the reality of Travis' world with the sensitive eye of a documentarian.  The city, the streets, and all who walked them are seen at eye level, at once intimately close and ephermerally fleetingas the cab drives through early-morning Manhattan.  He even gets to show up in the film in at least two cameos - once just as a passerby, the other as a passenger in Travis' taxi who himself is slowly unravelling mentally because his wife is cheating on him.    The unsettling tale of one man's collapse into psychosis is made human and connectable to the audience thanks to Paul Shrader's(sp?) wonderful script.  None of the events in his life that inspired the story, mentioned extensively in the truly-worthy new and old DVD extras, make it into the movie, but the important issue - the lonliness we all feel and have to deal with - does. Travis may be losing his mind and heading for a nuclear-sized explosion, but we can relate to him by how alone he feels.    Shrader calls the cab in the movie \\"a rolling metal coffin.\\"  It's an appropriate metaphor.  Because in the two-perspective ending, we have to wonder if Travis has found the misplaced justification he was looking for when he murders a bunch of lowlives to save a child prostitute - soon after a failed assassination attempt on presidential candidate Pallentine! - from society, or is he simply in his own personal Heaven; we don't see Travis' reflection in the rear-view mirror of his taxi when he adjusts it.    Leonard Maltin's video guide slams this film as excessive, overrated and violent.  He needs to give it another look.  \\"Taxi Driver\\" is truly a masterpiece of talent and craftsmenship.
B000022TSW|5.0|South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut is a different type of movie.  It puts a new spin on musicals, comedies, and cartoon movies.  It's a wild ride from start to finish.<br /><br />The fans of the show will be delighted to see the antics of characters like Satan and Terrence and Philip.  The other small characters make appearanes.<br /><br />The story is just as brilliant as the songs.  It's one of the funniest I've seen.  As for animated films, it would be more highly praised if it weren't for the bad language.  But what is South Park without it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00003CX9E|5.0|To me Citizen Kane is about the dangers of the self-made man and his ego.  America loves the image of this kind of man making his way to the top.  This film shows what often can be involved and how good intentions over time often become distorted by issues of power, greed and ego.  The Protestant Work Ethic has long been the bane of our exisitence in this country since Colonial times.  Combine that with a born again christian outlook and you have all the excess and extreme of the American character.<br /><br />We claim to have no aristocracy in this nation, but are not all the Kane's, Hearst's, and Rockefeller's our eqivilent!  I would argue that the self-made man is more of a danger than any noble.  The self-made man has tasted poverty and wants to crawl his way to the top no matter the price.  This outlook, born out of the merciless Industrialism of the last Century has ravaged the natural resources of this land.<br /><br />Citizen Kane shows us what total, uncontrolled Capitalism is, and how autocratic men like this run it, making any modern day King or noble sweet by comparison.  Watch this film for its brilliant camera techniques, and for the incredible stage presence of Orson Welles, yes by all means.  But also see this film as a perspective on the American character which has given us our very bloody and ruthless 200 + years of history.  Can we change our natioanl outlook and save the enviroment?  Only time will tell.

Coincidentally, this is created by the same man who gave us Aliens.<br /><br />I'm sure all of you know the story, Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent back in time by John Connot to protect his young self from the T-1000.  This movie is action packed and amazing when it comes to technology.  The T-1000 looks even better than most of the movie being produced today.<br /><br />But the real treat here is the DVD.  Two Discs jam packed full of features.  It includes numerous features, three, count them, three versions of the movie, theatrical, special, and extended editons of the movie.  It also includes a very busy audio commentary, the script anf 700+ storyboards.  There's so much on this disc it'd take me hours just to list all of it.<br /><br />This is a Must Have.  Definite Must Have.  The movie is wonderful and the DVD complements it perfectly.
B000GIXEIG|2.0|Grendel and Beowulf is yet another retelling of the epic 6th century poem Beowulf, but is not a good one. The film looks great, filmed in Iceland you can really believe you're in Denmark or Sweden fifteen centuries ago. The clothing, armor and swords are well done as well. But for telling an exciting story, this movie is pretty dull. There's a lot of talking and standing around, but not much action. Other problems include sporadic dialog that is too modern and out of place, and the actors accents. The hero, Beowulf, who is from Sweden, is played nicely by Gerard Butler but he makes no attempt to hide his Scottish accent. Sarah Polley plays a Danish witch with a flat American accent. Everytime they spoke I found it jarring as it just didn't fit. The character of the witch and a few other elements are add-ons to the original material and aren't needed and don't really work. This is a nice looking film, but not a good one.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is another fabulous movie from writer Charlie Kaufman ([[ASIN:B00007AJF8 Being John Malkovich]], [[ASIN:B00005JLRE Adaptation (Superbit Collection)]], [[ASIN:B0000714E6 Human Nature]]).  Joel Barish wants to forget his former girlfriend so he goes to a company and gets his memory erased.    This movie is wonderful and really makes you think.  I recommend that everybody should see this movie.    The DVD, which is an upgrade from the single disc features a few more things.  Not only do you get the same features from the first disc (which very well may be that first disc) you get a second disc full of other features.    There's a second interview with Kate Winslet and Michel Gondry (the first contained Jim Carrey and the director).  A feature for Michel Gondry himself and more deleted scenes from the movie.  There's even a commemorative photo book.    This DVD is highly recommended.  The movie's one of the best of the year.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|What else can be said about Once Upon A Time In the West?  Sergio Leone released his greatest western with this movie.  It's a fun from the opening credits to the end credits.  A wonderful movie at that.    Finally, on this Two Disc collection we get a commentary track, three featurettes, they can be split.  And the movie looks absolutely gorgeous.    It's a definite must have.    My other favorites from him ([[ASIN:B0000DI87S Once Upon a Time in America (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0001GF2DS The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - Extended Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]) are also must haves.

This is a brilliant movie.  In my opinion, the best of 2005.    Steven Spielberg tackles this tough subject ever so perfectly.  It's quite a wonderful movie to watch as well.  It's so refreshing to see cinema being used as a way to teach more than just one to entertain.    I recommend this movie to everyone.  It's a definite must see, one that will give you a new perspective on life.    The DVD itself features an introduction by Steven Spielberg.    Must See.

B000NA2776|5.0|Mika is an awesome artist with a really different sound, similar to 'Queen'.<br />I like every song on this cd, which is unusual for me. I'm kind of picky with music, and usually see much of the modern stuff as 'miscellaneous noise'.<br />This cd is very energetic without being irritating, it's great for house cleaning, etc. You can preview all the tracks before buying though, so that'd probably your best method of deciding whether or not to buy it!
B000025H0Q|5.0|Just as every great story comes complete with a beginning, middle, and end, Bryter Layter sews the missing hem between the promising future in the album Five Leaves Left and the bleak, tragic finale of Pink Moon. Even in fifth grade, the first time I ever heard a Nick Drake song, it struck me with awe that something so beautiful could be so sad at the same time. Of course I was too young to think much of it, and I nearly forgot the name for close to ten years.     Moving out on my own and beginning college, I subscribed to an online music service that offered me a nearly unlimited selection, and it was not long before I fell back in love with his music. The enchanting arrangements complement the character behind every note of guitar and voice, which is always undeniably Nick. Duality still existed in my mind though, wondering how these expressions of a life so melancholy could still be upbeat and nearly happy. My questions were answered upon buying the Fruit Tree Box Set and realizing that the online service I was using did not have rights to the song 'Northern Sky'. Any of you who have heard this song may very well understand the element of my surprise.     For the rest of you, it is almost necessary to start at the very beginning. The album opens, as it should, with only Nick on guitar. A soft backdrop of strings follows shortly, and we're given a nice little minute-and-a-half of 'Introduction'. The most Pop-oriented song on the album, 'Hazey Jane II' jumps in with a fairly rhythmic strum, as well as a few horns to add to the mix. Of notable mention here, in case you're unfamiliar with the complexity of his lyricism, this first song starts \\"What will happen in the morning...\\" and after reasonable questioning, ends \\"If songs were lines in a conversation, the situation would be fine.\\" Shifting into the realm of Jazz, although not entirely leaving the Pop feel, 'At The Chime Of A City Clock' gives quite a proper impression of roaming the streets of London in the 70's. This sets up a 6/8 Jazz romp on piano, 'One Of These Things First' which you might recognize from the 2004 movie 'Garden State'. Even with the total shift in format, Nick's voice and guitar are always the forefront, and always the base of the song. 'Hazey Jane I' completes the cycle, and we return with a song that seems it would have been just as beautiful had there been no accompaniment of strings or drums at all. The lyrics sound as if they were from a poem Nick had been sitting on for years, and he had finally gotten the right music to complete his perfect picture of 'Jane'.    Return the stylus, and flip to side two (or, as this is a review of the CD, just keep listening).     The second half starts similarly to the first with the title track, 'Bryter Layter', a happy little swinging instrumental that reminds you of how brilliant these musicians really are. Solidarity sinks in immediately with the second track though, as 'Fly' is a shadow of how decadently Nick begins to see the world. Not to be taken heavily, next comes 'Poor Boy', a return to Jazz-Pop that is such a quick synchopated time signature, I spent years mistaking it as 5/4. Through the verses you come to see the character (of course, Nick himself) as someone who has lost so much and so often, that there is nothing left in the world but to live. A great saxophone solo to the end shows exactly how remarkably disenchanting that could be, which falls seamlessly into what was once unfamiliar to me: that first strum of 'Northern Sky'. Nick then said it best himself, \\"I've never felt magic crazy as this\\" as what unfolded was undeniably the most beautiful song in the entirety of his work. I probably listened to that song a dozen times in a row right then, and yet those first pings on the ride cymbal still give me goosebumps to this day. \\"Brighten my northern sky,\\" he says, and it's as if the best friend you've been worried about for years just gave you the deepest, most sincere smile you've ever seen. Itwas at this point that I knew Nick Drake - he was broken and utterly disconnected, and yet, there was always one thing that would make him happy: music. Ever since he was a young boy, his family would constantly entertain themselves through performance, and it was here where he felt most at home. His mother was an avid songwriter, and he very much took after her influence, as 'Northern Sky' shows through its poetic inscription of the endless fields and wood he grew near in her household. The only words he knew well how to speak were notes, and it gave him some connection to the rest of the world. Finally, after hearing this song in its place with the rest, I felt as if I had discovered what was entirely missing from my Nick Drake experience, and it only made me love this album infinitely more. It concludes with 'Sunday', one last instrumental, although this one is rather somber. A lonely flute plays in and out of Nick's rock-solid guitar rhythms, and the drums, bass guitar, winds, and strings chime in to remind you of their presence. The song gets progressively louder and happier until dropping off, leaving the flute and guitar to duet one last time before fading to the end. As the album spins to a stop, so concludes the happiest days of the tormented Nick Drake's life. Fortunately for us, he left a beginning, middle, and end to a career that allows us to still enjoy his presence now, nearly forty years later.
0316067598|1.0|I do not question the Luttrell's patriotism but his book poorly reflects the American values the author's supposed to be defending in the first place.  When Uncle Sam sends you abroad to mete foreign policy from the barrel of a gun, and you return in the middle of an ongoing war and publish a book that's going to be distributed internationally, citizens can rightfully expect a more intelligent and considered account, not a sensationalistic apologia in the form of a partisan rag.  Judging from the stellar reviews, at least at Amazon, the average reviewer has lower expectations.  While co-written with a ghost writer Luttrell's name is on the cover: it's his responsibility.  Here he can't assign blame for his mission's failure (the supposed subject of the book, his eye-witness account), neither on the liberals, nor on the media.  These are the author's bêtes noires, though it's hard to imagine how the \\"liberals\\" are responsible for our military's Rules of Engagement, while the same media he's demonizing is the very tool he's exploiting to promote the book and seal a Hollywood film deal (one hopes Luttrell, a self-proclaimed good Christian, will donate his royalties and proceeds to the next-of-kin of the brave Americans who died that day, and the brave Afghan villagers who saved his life).  Many Amazon reviewers claim this is the \\"best\\" book they've ever read which says what it says about Luttrell's core audience.  It makes you wonder what they've been reading because Luttrell's book is a font of the sort of mean-spirited 'my country right or wrong' nonsense.  Luttrell's account reflects poorly on himself and, sadly, upon on everyone and everything he proudly associates himself with: SEALs, special forces, the US military, the CIC, the War on Terror, the United States ...  Thankfully and ironically those who come out clean are the supposed subjects of whom \\"Luttrell\\" doesn't really say much, those he claims are the reason for his writing, those he says he seeks to immortalize: his brothers-in-arms.  Luttrell is so focused on himself and his family, twin karma, all-you-can-eat free-food vigils and all things Texan that you'll read more about American hero and Medal of Honor recipient Lt. Michael P. Murphy, USN, in a one or two page news article than you will in Luttrell's entire book.  Why didn't Luttrell devote a page or two to each of the 19 or so brave men who perished that day in battle and attempting to save the team?  It's such a glaring omission that one supposes the next of kin dissociated themselves from the project.  Instead of delivering on his promise -- immortalizing his blood brothers -- Luttrell preaches hate to a narrow and reactionary audience.  He believes his readership is more interested in hearing him whine and assign the blame for his mission's failure on the \\"media\\" and the \\"liberals\\".  Mr. Luttrell: making money selling a book that sows and fuels disunity in an already divided nation during wartime isn't, to say it politely, the right thing to do.  Regarding the content of the account, the pantingly childish, pious and sensational approach to what is supposed to be factual material raises more questions than it answers.  How did Luttrell emerge relatively unscathed while his comrades were, according to his account, shot to pieces?  Why did these professionals blunder?  They went into an area where they knew they'd be vastly outnumbered, yet they were out of touch from the start.  Why was the team's ability to communicate so patchy?  What was their brief?  Take on 200 trained Taliban fighters with four rifles?  Hide in plain view?  What did they and or their commanders expect?  Why isn't this sufficiently explained?  Why did these professionals, who had been operating in the area and were accustomed to false insertions, why did they leave the fast ropes?  Luttrell omits important information.  Access to video taken by the Taliban enemy is readily available on the internet.  When the team was immediately discovered by goat herders they had no means to bind them, yet the SEALs were lugging amongst other things a laptop computer filled with sensitive data, their I.D. cards, etc.  Again, Luttrell's narrow-minded narrative raises questions but doesn't provide satisfactory answers.  Why didn't Lt. Murphy abort the mission when they were located by the goat herders?  Lt. Murphy's alleged decision to put the fate of the goat herders up to a vote, if indeed that ever happened, is baffling and appalling.  The Navy is not a democracy.  The team leader was an officer for a reason.  Is this how the SEALs operate?  I think not; I truly hope not.  (On a lighter note, perhaps the whole book project is some kind of sick joke designed to disinform for the enemy.)  What happened to the rescuers who died?  How was their rescue effort organized and executed?  What happened to the target?  What happened to Luttrell's saviors, Americans and Afghans?  There is no satisfying epilogue and one must again assume that Luttrell was neither interested nor grateful enough to find out.  This reader expected a mature, thoughtful account with a nod to lessons-learned.  Instead Luttrell's book is an off-key, self-righteous, finger-pointing rearguard defense for ... a fiasco.  Mark Bowden, who probably didn't serve in the military, who probably is neither Texan nor Republican, not that it makes any difference, wrote a stunning account of another military blunder called \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and it's the sort of richly insightful and humane account that makes you proud of our most capable and dedicated servicemen and servicewomen.  Not Luttrell's book.  I doubt the manuscript was provided to the Navy or the White House prior to publication.  As other reviewers have already suggested, wait for a more objective, critical and complete account of the events.
B000PT6OY2|5.0|The Bond movies have really aged badly and the newest ones were so gadget-heavy that the plot was almost secondary.      That being said, Casino Royale was surprisingly good.  Daniel Craig was believable/likable and the action wasn't as absurd as some of the more recent movies.  Gadgets were kept to a minimum and their introduction wasn't as overt as in recent films.    Hardcore Bond fans might not like this as much, but for someone who was just a casual enthusiast it should be a great match.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Inside Man begins with what looks like a typical bank robbery. Four people dressed as painters hold up the bank. Enter Detective Frazier, a tough streetwise cop on his first negotiating job. Frazier matches wits with the clever bank robber, Dalton Russell. While Frazier and Russell have the ultimate battle of wits, a twist occurs when Madeline White a sassy aid to the elite class of New York, enters wanting to talk with Dalton for her own purposes. This movie is truly a roller coaster ride with high-speed twist after twist leading the viewer to an unbelievable finish.   Director Spike Lee rejoins Denzel Washington for the fourth pairing of the actor- director duo. Clive Owen as Dalton Russell and Jodie Foster as Madeline White also join the two. A strong supporting cast makes this a solid group for the film.   Spike Lee does a good job of developing each of the main characters in the story and allows the audience to view things from each person's angle. Denzel Washington's character shares personal and professional experience, which shows what motivates him to do his job.The movie, reveals just enough about him to leave viewers wanting more.    The most thrilling part of the movie has to be the plot development. It is done in such a way as to keep watchers guessing throughout the whole movie. Each emergence of a new plot twist is unexpected and keeps the action going. The use of the interrogation scenes while the movie still flows throws another twist into the movie because it makes the viewer unsure of what is going on. Lee does a good job of keeping viewers on their toes but not allowing viewers to get lost in all that is happening in the scenes.   Inside Man is a thrilling ride that does not have the typical cops versus robber storyline. This is no family friendly movie. It is rated R for the use of stronger curse words, and a few sexually suggestive conversations and scenes. While it is possible that this detracts from some moviegoer's experiences, the plot andthe character development alone make Inside Man a movie to see.

630460291X|2.0|The most notable thing about this product isn't the movie or special features, but the arrangement of items on the disk.  It's a two -sided DVD, which is fine.  But what's weird is, instead of putting the movie on one side and the special features on the other, they put the special features on side one with half of the movie.  The movie actually stops half way through and instructs you to flip it over so you can finish watching it!!  This is definitely a major downside.  It's a great movie, so if you haven't seen it yet, I would strongly suggest watching it at some point. But if you're planning on buying it, you might want to wait until a different DVD version comes out, so that you can avoid having to get up in the middle of your movie to flip it over.
0786838655|4.0|I heard Rick Riordan being interview on NPR and was intrigued enough to go to our neighborhood bookstore with my eight-year old daughter and find the first book in the Percy Jackson series.  Before buying, I had my daughter apply the Richard Bach Book Test: opening the book at three random spots and reading one or two paragraphs.    She loved all three sections.  I would have been in serious jeapordy if I had not then bought the book... We actually bought the Book 1 and Book 2 at the same time.    My daughter just ate up the books.  Even though she's only eight, she loved the characters and the story.    A week later I bought Book 3 which she promptly devoured.  We are now eagerly awaiting Book 4!    Just wanted to provide some input to those with somewhat younger kids.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I'm not a big fan of western movies...... but this is nothing short of an \\"art film\\" masterpiece that has no equal. Morricone's music actually brings tears to my eyes. It is arguably Leone's masterwork. Georgous scenery and incredibly beautiful cinematogophy. This film is a stunning work of beauty and art. I still can't watch it without a tear welling up. Yes, it's terribly slow moving compared to today's \\"I want explosions, fireballs and laser beams every five seconds\\" type of films. If you want that kind of film, stick your head inside a strobe light for two hours. \\"Once Unon a Time\\" is still the greatest piece of cowboy western cinema ever made.

1563898586|4.0|As one of my first forays into the world of the graphic novel, \\"LOEG\\" certainly caught my attention. The book is full of memorable images, strong characters, exotic locates and plenty of action.<br /><br />The book itself tells the tale of the formation of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen -- a late 19th-century collection of famous and infamous personages known to the reader through novels and films. Though the characters are familiar, their incarnation here can be disorienting and even offensive. The Invisible Man is gruff and homicidal and uses his power to satisfy his personal urges. Captain Nemo is some sort of aloof Indian emir brandishing a machine harpoon gun agaunbst \\"Mohammedans,\\" and his Nautilus is a squidlike submarine with mechanical tentacles. Dr Jekyll is a small, sweaty man, while his Mr. Hyde persona is an enormous brute who enjoys literally tearing his foes limb from limb. The central characters in the novel is Mina Murray, a lady of an uncertain, yet sullied past, whose courage is matched by her elusiveness. Often sharing the spotlight is Allan Quatermain, a former famous big game hunter (I gathered) languishing in an opium haze in the back streets of Cairo. The characters, once collected, become a sort of crime-fighting collective, their mutual skills offsetting their individual defects. They are called on by mysterious authorities to work on various bizarre super crimes, including a finale that threatens all of London.<br /><br />The book's conceit is that it *is* a comic from the late 1800s, and its sensibilities (good and bad) reflect that era's prejudices. Bad guys include a horde of expendable Chinese criminals and a devil's den of Arab thugs bent on rapine, characterizations that are normally found offensive in the modern world. Leavening this un-PC environment are clever period touches, such as product advertisements in mock-19th century style. An illustrated prose story at the back of the book provides a prequel that explains Quatermain's opium addiction. This part of the book is a real contrast to the quickly-read material before it. Its hyperbolic imagery, turgid prose and quasi-religious pretensions destroyed the book's fast pace, and could not make up for its lack of clever ideas.<br /><br />The current volume gathers the 6-edition comic book series into a single edition. The story's narrative starts at the front of the book, followed (rather confusingly, I thought) by the front covers, back covers and special content. The book's style teeters on the edge of exploitation, but retains enough momentum to propel it forward. Some readers might be amused by the book's gathering of so many 19th century fictional heros, some might be confused. The constant stream of literary references (more than I picked up) may amuse you or annoy you.

Its hyperbolic imagery, turgid prose and quasi-religious pretensions destroyed the book's fast pace, and could not make up for its lack of clever ideas.    The current volume gathers the 6-edition comic book series into a single edition. The story's narrative starts at the front of the book, followed (rather confusingly, I thought) by the front covers, back covers and special content. The book's style teeters on the edge of exploitation, but retains enough momentum to propel it forward. Some readers might be amused by the book's gathering of so many 19th century fictional heros, some might be confused.

B000P0I4O4|3.0|I could not find any box office information for \\"The Contract,\\" which is interesting because you would not think of either Morgan Freeman or John Cusak as doing direct to video movies.  The same would be said for director Bruce Beresford, whose \\"[[ASIN:1572521775 Breaker Morant]]\\" has always been a personal favorite and who was not nominated for an Oscar for directing \\"[[ASIN:B000087F7D Driving Miss Daisy]].\\"  But the explanation for this anomaly is that this 2007 film comes from Millennium Films, which is the theatrical wing of Nu Image and the fact of the matter is that I only checked out \\"The Contract\\" because it had both Freeman and Cusak (although I will admit that having either one of them would normally be a good enough reason to check out a film).  But despite their presence and something of little twist regarding the plot in the end game, this movie never really commands our attention as it keeps itself to doing things by the numbers and never offering the sort of memorable moment or thrilling sequence you would like to see in such a movie.  At least Freeman and Cusak got to spend several weeks in Bulgaria making this film.<br /><br />Freeman is Frank Cordell, who is not merely a professional assassin: he and his team kill their targets by making them look like accidents.  This could be pretty cool, but the script by Stephen Katz and John Darrouzet keeps things fairly simple for the two examples we get to see of Cordell and his team doing their jobs.  However, keeping things simple does not pay off this time as Cordell is captured and his team comes up with a plan to get him back.  Meanwhile, out in the forest is Ray Keene, played by Kusak, a man who has lost his wife to cancer and has taken his son, Chris (Jamie Anderson), camping.  They are not getting along and Ray is hoping some time together will help them bound, but apparently he has no other ideas on how to reconnect with the boy.  The next thing Ray knows he and Chris meet up with not only Cordell, but also a dying FBI agent who gives Ray his gun and tells him to get his prisoner to the authorities.  Obviously, this is going to be a most unusual camping trip.<br /><br />Fortunately, Ray used to be a cop, although when he announces the fact it is news to us.  Cordell tries to reason with Ray, explaining that his guys are coming and Ray does not stand a chance.  Of course the good guys are coming too, but there are more plot complications to come because Cordell has another job to do and being captured greatly impairs his ability to do his job.  The supporting cast is pretty good, but except for Freeman, none of them are given anything interesting to say, let alone do.  Alice Krige plays one of the suits in Washington, D.C., with a vested interst in what is going on, and Megan Dodds, looking considerably more like a human being than she did as the wicked step sister in \\"[[ASIN:B00006ZXSK Ever After]],\\" plays Sandra, a woman they meet in the woods who gets caught up in the misadventure.  Bill Smitrovich plays the local cop, who alternates between being a shade too smart or a step too slow in dealing with the developing situation.<br /><br />Yet despite the cast, \\"The Contract\\" is a wash as a film.  If Freeman was not in it, I might have fallen asleep while watching it, because even if he was not being given anything really interesting to say he is of the class of actors that make the recitation of the phone book compelling.  I can even make the argument that the title gives away what should have been the twists and turns in the final act that changed everything and made this film more interesting.  Maybe having a first class musical score would have punched up things some more, but \\"The Contact\\" does not have that either.  Ultimately, a film begins with the words on the script, and beyond the basic plot that somehow got this cast to sign up, there is simply nothing there to help the director and cast get this thriller to a level where it would be worth watching twice, let alone once.

B000RJO578|4.0|The creative team behind the 2004 horror-comedy \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" takes on the action genre in the hilarious comedy \\"Hot Fuzz\\". Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London's finest and most dedicated police officer who is reassigned by his superiors to the small crime-free village of Sanford. When a series of suspicious and gruesome accidents stuns this uneventful village, Sgt. Angel and his bumbling new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) learn that there is more to Sanford than it appears. \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is definitely one of the year's funniest films. The story is entertaining and offers some nice twists and very funny moments. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have great comic chemistry. The 2007 action-comedy also stars Timothy Dalton (The Living Daylights), Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Academy Award winner Jim Broadbent (Iris). \\"Hot Fuzz\\" received overwhelming positive reviews from critics and proved a commercial success earning more than twice of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".<br /><br />If you missed \\"Hot Fuzz\\" in theaters, then I strongly recommend checking out this acclaimed comedy on DVD. \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a colorful and detailed video transfer. Its 5.1 EX Dolby Digital sound is clean and well balanced. The interactive menus are very appealing. Among special features, it includes the hilarious \\"The Man Who Would Be Fuzz\\" featurette, outtakes, deleted scenes, storyboards, trailers, \\"Fuzz-O-Meter\\" trivia option and a fun audio commentary with star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright. Overall, \\"Hot Fuzz\\" scores a \\"B+\\".

Any scintillas of trust in politics and government,are now gone for even more different reasons. This book seems to keep me awake and keeps my ears wider open to what can happen in this country and this world. It is not just about the shameful and bloody acts in our westward expansion. The word \\"treaty\\" from these times is a joke. I can also see more about international expansions. America makes large wrongs, as do other countries do to their own people in history. My heart feels buried because Americans, we, made such innumerable, horrendous and cruel acts. This book remains to me as a great \\"jolt\\" to my consciousness. He put together a great example of what America did do to the Native American Peoples. Look at the status of the Native American Peoples who are left today.

B000028U0Y|5.0|This album has a different feel from most live recordings.  Not only because of it's obvious convict crowd, but there's just a vibe that is hard to put into words.  If you don't know Cash's material, you'll have a blast as each song unfolds and you get the prison relevance.  If you DO know his material, you will appreciate the setlist and the variations he throws in.    The album flows well and the sound is excellent.  I think it's great that in between songs you can hear inmates being paged for visitation, and Johnny is as lively as ever, talking with the crowd and even playing a song penned by someone locked up there in Folsom Prison.    The movie centered a lot around this concert, it was a cool thing to add depth and feel, and listening to the album can be a trip in itself.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Ignore the naysayers here and watch this movie on a big screen, with a good surround sound system cranked up nice and loud. This is a full-on modern cinematic rollercoaster ride, made purely for fun, and it delivers in spades.<br /><br />Essentially a melange of Dracula, Frankenstein, and James Bond, with occasional soupcons of various and sundry genre touches, Van Helsing is a feast for the eyes and ears, and damn funny to boot. I came in expecting nothing, and was well and truly blown away.<br /><br />The effects are flawless, the story quite hilarious, and the overall tone suggests Raiders of the Lost Ark of Transylvania. Jackman and Beckinsale are tailor-made and work well together. Roxburgh gives one of the most hilarious villain performances in screen history, perfectly over the top; his moments alone are worth seeing the film for. I rarely watch recent movies more than once; I've seen this four times in a year and it keeps getting more impressive with each viewing.<br /><br />This is a superb piece of craftsmanship that never takes itself too seriously, and delivers massive doses of fun and many thrilling moments. A better flick for a cold and snowy Saturday's eve would be hard to find.<br /><br />Give it some time; Van Helsing will be a cult classic yet.

B000NA28I4|3.0|While obviously no Lord of the Rings, this is still a decent fantasy flick for the kiddos, made with care and craft. I don't know the source books so I can say from an objective viewpoint (whatever that is) that the script is about what you'd expect, as is the story, and so on; sorry, I'm not enough of a fanboy to be thoroughly offended by this movie's digressions from the Sacred Text.<br /><br />Coming in with no preconceptions, we were entertained, if not wildly, and have no regrets about watching this movie. A little visual enhancement went a long way. Open your mind and deal with this film on its own level, like the 10 year-old you once were (or still are, judging from some reviews here). There's some fun to be had here.

0618680004|1.0|This book starts out OK within the first 20 pages or so, but it quickly gets extremely boring and pointless. I was expecting intelligent arguments for/against creationism but the book is a serious bore-fest.    The author rambles and rambles about mind-numbing subjects until you find yourself reading a few pages only to realize that he really didn't say anything, and you have to actually start over and read over sections again to see if you missed something, as you find out you didn't. I am not kidding!! Go to a bookstore and skim the book as you will see what I mean.     If your into this type of psyco-babble, this book is for you. If you value your precious time, stay away, far away.
0374105235|5.0|\\"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier\\" is a captivating memoir that relates the experience of one boy's struggle to survive. Ishmael Beah was born and spent the first eighteen years of his life in war-torn Sierra Leone. After coming to the United States in 1998 and graduating from college in 2004, Beah became an advocate on behalf of children affected by war. His memoir is simply another way in which he is standing up for children who cannot speak for themselves.     In \\"A Long Way Gone\\" Beah recounts his adolescence in Sierra Leone. He remained largely untouched by the civil war raging in the country until rebels invaded his village when he was twelve. Although he managed to escape, he was separated from his family and wandered in search of them for a year until government armies captured him.    At times the book can be difficult to read in its grisliness, but Beah's matter-of-fact tone and simple honesty show the reader the reality of what he went through. Beah's account focuses on the facts of what he went through and what he and other children were forced to do to survive. He doesn't waste time making excuses, but simply tells the story like it is.    At a time when many memoirs are uninspiring and pointless, Beah writes with freshness and purpose. He is not writing simply to amuse himself or his readers; he is doing what he can to make people aware of a cause. Beah realizes that nothing will be done to help children affected by war if the world is not aware of their plight. His first-hand account cannot help but simultaneously move the reader and make him aware of what thousands of children suffer daily. With its brutal honesty and simple narrative, Beah's gripping account is one every person should read.
B000002ADT|5.0|It's amazing to me that this album was originally released in 1959 and remains for many THE classic jazz set, nearly 50 years later.  What timeless music!  When I was a boy, I couldn't really make sense of jazz.  I listened to \\"Bitches' Brew\\" and couldn't process the music at the time.  However, I have been increasingly drawn to jazz in the last decade.  I read about this recording but had NEVER heard it until this year!  Therefore, while 655 previous reviewers have commented on this, it has exploded in my ears this year.  That wild John Coltrane sax on \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" is ambrosia.  Davis' trumpet on \\"Blue In Green\\" to me reads like the voice of sadness, reaching out and gripping my heart with a soft and gentle force.  The build of \\"All Blues\\" is amazing with its edge and every instrument including percussion painting a picture that somehow is slightly unnerving even as it is beautiful.  CBS' reissue apparently thought it was such an amazing set that they left the inner cover of the booklet completely blank.  What is to be said?  Let my voice join the many others who over the decades have marveled at \\"Kind of Blue.\\"  It is a classic.  Bravo!

B000O178BY|5.0|I wake up every morning with a different 15-second bit of this record burrowing through my consciousness:  the chorus of \\"Zero Sum,\\" the industrial computer drum break freakout of \\"The Great Destroyer,\\" the fuzzy guitar lead from \\"Capital G,\\" the weird and desperate lyrics from \\"The Good Soldier,\\" (\\"I am trying to believe...\\"), the David-Byrney belting from \\"Vessel\\" (\\"My God!  I don't think I can last here!\\"), the blippy intro to \\"Survivalism.\\"  It goes on and on.  I realize now that, having seen a show from every tour since they opened Lollapalooza 1 with a daylight performance from Pretty Hate Machine, that NIN has got to be my favorite band.  So as an inveterate Nailhead, I can truly say that this is the man's best work yet, even after the sprawling genius of \\"The Fragile\\" (my fave up to this one, f*** the doubters) and the doom-angst bitmaps of \\"The Downward Spiral.\\"    This is a fantastic, progressive smash-up of 70s concept albums, 80s new wave rhythms, 90s Bomb Squad noise, and 00s anti-Bush wigouts.

1932100660|5.0|Finally, thanks to T Colin Campbell, the research to defend the benefits of consuming a whole-foods, plant-based diet is available to all.  The research is so compelling, it cannot be ignored.      Within the very near future, this book will become the cornerstone for a new paradigm.      Every health care practitioner will be REQUIRED to read this book.  The Campbell's research removes all doubt that plant-based diet ALONE is sufficient to not only prevent, but reverse disease.  Practitioners who refuse to follow the dietary guidelines outlined within this book will justifiably be sued for malpractice and have their licenses removed!       Every industry even remotely connected with diet and nutrition, take note! Any grocer or restauranteur who does not immediately remove animal food products from his/her shelves or menu will be drummed out of business for not acting in the public interest.       No longer will cattle be raised for flesh or dairy, but orchards planted, instead.      Persons consuming animal foods will be seen for the barbarians they are.  Society will no longer tolerate savagery toward animals.  Crimes of violence will decline to near-zero levels.      Think I'm kidding?  Not at all.  It is my sincerest desire that this book acts as a catylist to sweeping societal change on every level.  What the book makes more than obvious is that the solution for our healthcare crisis, lies on the tip of our forks.      THANK YOU, Dr Campbell!

I'm sure the trailers were very compelling, but.... give me a break!  Who's running Hollywood, the Marketing Departments?  Perhaps, in another age, this might have been regarded as melodramatic.  In this age, two thumbs down.   There are some fine actors here.  Unfortunately, they have been written to be and directed to be characters less than the capability of their talent.   This movie is not simply a gritty western, nor is it a great romance, nor is it an ambitious biography, but it tries to be all of these without finally defining itself.  I want to assume that most of the \\"facts\\" of the movie are fairly true, or \\"Hollywood true,\\" which compelled me to watch it to the end, but the dialogue is patterned and scripted (well, duh!) and predictable.  I'm not talking about everyday speech, but the plethora of those one liners that we just know that they must have said.      Foreshadowing is one thing, but orchestrated, TV-level plot revelations are not just an insult to an intelligent viewer, but, alas, boring.  To even compare this (as some previous reviewers have) to The Unforgiven is an affront to the Western as a genre.  Over-managed, predictable, but of some historical/biographical interest, this version is lamentable not just for the waste of talent we must endure to see it through to the end, but for the offense to the profession of dramatic portrayal.  I'm not surprised that the pros panned it.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|Alligator hooked me from the start and the hook (and hooks) has only become more firmly embedded since.  In fact, I have a hard time listening to all the cuts at one sitting because I wind up putting so many of them on interminable repeat play.     It is no Blonde on Blonde (what is?), but I think maybe twenty or thirty years from now Alligator's listeners will play it on whatever medium music is served up in at that future and they will think, like I do with, from around that Blonde on Blonde era, say, Surrealistic Pillow or the Byrds first album, \\"whoa, these guys were on to something.\\"      On the very best songs here, the music and voice/lyrics often work at cross-purposes producing a fusion that shouldn't succeed at all but in fact elevates both.      The music first.  Try to find a single indulgent or extraneous note in songs like Lit Up, Abel, Friend of Mine or Mr. November.  They are, rather, three to four minute hard pop gems, underpinned, and in Abel launched, by a tense and insistent drum line that courses through the song, as guitars, vocals, remix vocals layer on it and the listener tumbles into this deliberate, disciplined mix.     The lyrics, however, are everything but disciplined.  They are - for starters --  faintly paranoid (Secret Meeting), confused and louche (Karen, which of course also features a suggested telephone call that can only be embarrassing to all involved in it), achingly loyal (Friend of Mine), satiric and disdainful (All the Wine), full of illusionary control (Lit Up), mixes of promise and delusion (Mr. November, \\"in the arms of cheerleaders\\" indeed), and a poster slogan for the designated driver campaign (Abel).   But most of all, I think, Alligator matters and will last because it embraces all these impulses (as in Looking for Astronauts - or as my daughter had it the first time she heard the song - Looking for Restaurants, often a little too late for them as well -- \\"Take all your reasons and take them away/To the middle of nowhere...they all run together and never make sense/But that's how we like and that's all we want.\\"), understanding that complexity and contradiction are in the end what makes us conscious, interesting and human.    Alligator is not perfect.  I regularly skip Baby, We'll Be Fine and Val Jester, but as a portrait of a band in journey, journey as in Eliot's great \\"We shall not cease from exploration...\\" lines, Alligator is a brave and very successful work.
B000002H33|1.0|Music? This is not music. It's only the usual poor metal stuff, just like all the other metal rubbish. If you bang your head against the wall you obtain the same frantic chaos inside you. Useless and dangerous, without any porpouse, any importance, any difference from...nothingness. So, make yourself and your health a favour and buy something else, something lightfull and joyfull. Something to feel, to think, to remember. Anything else, but metal.
0694003611|5.0|My children loved this book.  We read it to them for many years.  Until they were able to read for themselves.  It's very soothing.  And because they were so familiar with it, they enjoyed it more.
B000QFCD2W|4.0|This is a worthy addition to any KD collection.  King is back with his own unique brand of innovative, maesto guitar work, dramatic, wailing vocals and occultic subject matter that combine to produce a forboding yet evilly appealing finished product.  For this kind of witchy lyrical subject matter and musicianship that will bring you back to the glory days when old-school metal could pack arenas, King is in a class by himself- no one does it better.    The album definitely has its standouts.  \\"Never Ending Hill\\" is very good and \\"Girl in the Bloody Dress\\" is a classic.  Both feature pounding guitar work with excellent riffs and catchy melodies; I can easily picture these becoming a regular addition to his setlist when he plays live.  After giving the whole thing a few listens, \\"Mirror\\" is decent and the others are ok tracks, but not great.  King seems to be varying his style somewhat; he relies on the more 'normal', lower vocal register though his signature over-the-top falsetto and high screeching vocals are still present but not as frequent.  Whether this is good or not good of course depends on your perspective.  King is not reinventing himself here but may be trying to appeal to a wider, more traditional metal palate.    Lyrically, it's weaker than many previous albums but what it lacks in this area it makes up for musically.  Whether you've been a fan of KD/MF for awhile or you're new to his work, King has put together an excellent addition to his discography further cementing his place as one of Metal's classic artists.    You won't be disappointed.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This is quite simply the best CD I've purchased in 15 years!  I am just stunned!  As with most CD purchases I make, I was hoping for 3 or 4 really good songs.  This goes so far beyond that.  I cannot stop listening to it!  I don't even have a favorite song ... the entire collection is just awesome!  It's the best rock opera in a generation ... the Tommy of the 21st century.  Sooooo ... I guess you could say I like it.  :)    Start writing your acceptance speech Nikki ... this one is a winner!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Saw the movie in the theatres and it was awesome.  Saw it again in blu-ray with a hi-def television in the comfort of my living room... WOW!  It was freakin' awesome!  This is definitely a \\"must have\\"!
031286504X|5.0|I am Legend is one of the best short stories you'll ever read.  His next best would be in my opinion [[ASIN:0575074639 The Shrinking Man (Sf Masterworks)]].  Like with that story you can either choose to buy the story as a standalone novel or in a collection with others of his short stories. Granted not all of his other short stories are in the masterpiece league so depending on price you might want to evaluate your options to either buy I am Legend as a standalone or part of an anthology. It's important to point out that some reviewers have not specified what they are reviewing so don't just assume this book on whichever cover art version you have selected comes with the other stories they mention. As well as standalone books there are various anthologies that come with different short stories inside to other versions.<br /><br />I am Legend is the can't put down thrilling tale of Robert Neville who to his knowledge is the last non vampire on the planet. Even animals seem to also have caught this strange virus. He has a theory of why he's immune but I won't divulge it as it is near the end of the book and I'm not a fan of people who give away spoilers. Anyway his daily existence is filled with repairing his house from the nightly attacks by vampires who want him including his now arch enemy Ben Cortman a former work colleague. On non cloudy days he likes to venture out into the community to get supplies and put a stake through the hearts of vampires he comes across to lessen the amount outside his house each night. A great tale, well written and well worth your money!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|the movie porco rosso is a great story about a WWI flying ace who after the war became a bountyhunter. the story is more than that though, its filled with romance, actcion,and comedy. all of this is based in a whimsical world that could only be imagined by the great director hayao miyazaki, one of the greatest film makers of our time. this is a really great movie and a must see for the young and young at heart.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|when i first saw this film i thought to my self \\"it's ok, it could be better\\", but then i watched it again and was mystified! this is a beautiful story of a young girl fighting to save the humans that are left and the earth. the story takes place after a nuclear war that destroys the planet and most of the people and animals on it, the only forest left is a poison forest full of giant insects that protect it. its a cautionary tale of how if we let our selves go to far their will be nothing left, this is one of the reasons i love Mr. miyazaki's films so much most of the say that we half to protect our world, because if we don't, who will?
0142000663|5.0|I read this book in high school and did not pick it up again until I was 50.  What a difference a few years makes!  This book is about hope while facing incredible challenges. If there is hope, there is life.  When the voices of the suffering come together, they simmer, begin to boil and rise up (hence, the wrath of the migrant workers). It is about finding strength in different sources (a mother surfacing as the leader of her family). It is about families circling the wagons and holding onto to each other because often that was all they had. This story has been told many times in the course of history of laborers and is the backbone of the unions. Chapter 29 says it all.  Very moving. A must read over and over again.
055358894X|5.0|As many other reviewers will tell you, this is an amazing first book by Lynch.  Probably the most telling factor is the pace with which the book moves.  The first 10 aside, the 700 pages disappear and dissolve into an engrossing story.  This will be one of those books that keeps you up all night, makes you late for work, and gets you behind on your chores.  Perhaps this is the work of a good editor, but the job is done!    Also of note - this book serves as a great introduction to the genre of Fantasy.  No dragons, no knights, no overblown romance.  The use of magic, though critical in the book, isn't really dwelled upon until the second half, and the world never truly feels impossible.  Locke does the impossible, but he does it with the most mundane tools and a great heap of wits.    Built up from so many existing motifs - pirates, the mob, cops and robbers, magic, secret societies, torn worlds, ancient mysteries - you might think tLoLL has no surprises, but you'd be very, very wrong.
074356619X|5.0|I use this as a constant reinforcement.  It is a great cd set!  I highly recommend it.

0765340798|4.0|This was an excellent ending to the prequel trilogy. The whole series was riveting, entertaining and filled in a lot of the background for the famous Dune trilogy. The only shortfall is the slightly rushed ending to explain the origins of the Bene Geserit, the Guild navigators and the explanation of the convoluted animosity between house Atreides and House Harkonnen. But, this is just nit-picking, this book was a great ending for the prequel trilogy to Dune.
1574535811|5.0|I use audiobooks when I take long trips and this was certainly worth it.  It is abridged but I don't think I would have been interested in the unabridged version (too much information).  The detail was great and I can feel confident discussing this issue with my patients based on what I learned from this audiobook.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|After seeing this twosome on Sound Stage, I was hooked and ready to purchase.  I realy love all the songs (rare), and would purchase more Mark Knopfler. The instrumentals are beautiful and complex, nice blending of voices.
B000M5AJQ8|2.0|I heard so many good things about this movie so I figured it had to be good, so I bought it. Then the problem came when I was watching it, monotony. For a movie labeled as suspense it didn't have very much. Aside from top-rate acting, this movie suffers from a number of issues regarding the speed at which the story moves, such as: slow, slow, and slow. On top of the story running slow, the ending was the most pitiful attempt I've seen in ages. Anyways, I watch a lot of movies, and this one does not show up on must-watch radar in my opinion.    2/5 stars for Jack Nicholson only.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Wow, what a wonderful film. It's almost shocking to see these days - a genuinely nice, but not sappy, film. It's the story of Beatrix Potter, the all-time best-selling author of children's books. It's about how she became an author, who helped, who didn't, who encouraged her, who didn't, and who she fell in love with and what happened with him. This is a very involving film, right from the start and it doesn't overstay its welcome at 92 minutes.    This is one of those rare films in which, even in some of its tougher moments, and there were some, had me almost in tears many times. I guess I am hopeless romantic. Anyone who is will treasure this film, male or female. Anyone who appreciates beautiful scenery will treasure this, too. Some of the shots of the English countryside are absolutely stunning. This is a beautiful picture, visually and in story. There really isn't anything to criticize.    Rene Zellweger gives an terrific performance as \\"Beatrix Potter.\\" She is the second American actor I have heard on screen in the last two months speak with a British accent and do it well enough that I didn't think about it after a short time. (The other was Edward Norton in \\"The Painted Veil.\\"). Zellweger and Ewan McGregor (\\"Norman Warne\\") are about as charming a couple as you will ever see on film. The support from Emily Watson, Barbara Flynn, Bill Patterson and the rest of the cast also is first-rate.    This is about a clean a movie as you'd ever see, too, regarding language and sex. However, I doubt kids wouldn't be interested in this film. It's an adult story.    If you are looking an interesting and emotional hour and a half of entertainment, this comes highly recommended.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|While looking for another Jane Austen film to buy for 'Girls Movie Night' for my 17yo daughter and I - I came upon North and South.  We watched one episode a night and anxiously awaited the next!  When we finished the entire movie we were ready to restart it again!  Wonderful shots in the mill........good characters.  Love it!
B000MRA5EM|4.0|Although disappointed I couldn't see this in 3-D, as advertised on the DVD (not the one being sold here), . I still thought the photography was amazing and the colors just spectacular. I've never seen underwater footage this good. This also is the first time I've actually heard the sounds that some of these marine creatures make. I just presumed, like many others, there was mostly silence underneath the surface. That's not so; there are some amazing sounds.    More so, there are some amazing creatures that most of us have never heard about or seen. Some of them are downright weird-looking, repulsive yet fascinating. They are so strange you think you're looking at some animated film with cartoon characters.....but these creatures are real. Some of them are frightening and brutal killers.    I've read complaints about the narration by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and have to agree on a couple points. Winslet does make an attempt to put some reflection in her voice but Depp sounds like he's sleepwalking through this. His voice is flat, a monotone, and it sounds like he's reading the material for the first time. Neither of these two add much life to his documentary.    Others complain that it's just under 40 minutes and thus, the DVD overpriced. Well,  I found it very interesting and stunning to view. I wouldn't mind adding it to my collection because this is something I would watch multiple times.
0751532711|5.0|I found myself saying \\"I've been meaning to buy that book!\\" for a while now.  Having heard reviews from friends, old and new, I finally quit procrastinating and ordered it!  It is the best decision that I could've made in my quest to financial freedom.  I believe this book will definitely facilitate the necessary mind-set for anyone looking to become financially independent.  This book provides a foundation for which to do so!  It is a must read!
B000QUCNP4|4.0|A couple of years ago, I read an article about how some people are still obsessed with the Zodiac serial killer case. Since the murderer was never apprehended, this case has fascinated a number of people for almost 40 years. There are websites and all kinds of people, apparently, who can't let go of this famous case.     Lo and behold - here's a movie about that obsession. I, probably like a number of viewers, thought this was just another film about the murderer, and it looked that way for the first hour of the 157-minute movie. However, it turns out be just as much a story about one guy who has this obsession about finding the killer. That man is \\"Robert Graysmith,\\" a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on Graysmith's books on the Zodiac killer, so it's no surprise the story winds up revolving around him.    For moviegoers looking for a hard-nosed, brutal serial-killer story, this must have been a disappointing film because it turns out to be a character study of \\"Graysmith\\" plus an in- depth behind-the-scenes look at police procedure which, as any cop could tell you, can be tedious work. However, there is still is enough violence and suspense, particularly early on, to satisfy some and there is a lot of information on the crimes itself, and a lot of suspects to entertain the \\"whodunit\\" mystery-solving viewer. Director David Fincher doesn't offer up the edge-of-your-seat thrillers as he did in \\"Se7en\\" and \\"Panic Room,\\" but this is still worth a look and recommended.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Tim Burton's original Batman was truly groundbreaking and did deserve the huge amounts of praise it recieved (I never really cared for any of the sequels. While the Joker was surreal, at least he was accetable. Batman Returns carried the unreality a little far). However, it was flawed. Mainly, it was small things that caught my attention, such as the fact that Batman's suit was so stiff that he could hardly fight in it (did it bother anybody else that he couldn't even turn his neck?) and the movie made me wonder how organized crime could realisticly be so obvious in a city and no one do anything about it. Batman Begins makes the corruption of Gotham's judicial system and police department very real and makes you realize that an independent like Batman, as unlikely a hero as he is, is badly needed. And instead of skirting around the issues with the batsuit we finally see every part of it explained from the horns on his head to the reason for the design of his cape and(GASP!)it actually seems plausable, even almost likely. Other pluses include:  Unlike in so many other movies, the special effects are not just there for themselves, but really add to the story. Other portrayals of Batman make him seem unstable and even dangerous to those he is supposedly protecting, while here he is an immovable, if dark, force for good with solid, sane reasons for doing what he does. (This movie just goes to show how adaptable Batman really is. There are so many good ways to portray him!) The villains, too, are unbelievably lifelike considering their origins (like Batman, the comics), good acting (by not only Christian Bale but Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman too)and a well devised plot draw you in and keep you wide-eyed, and, though some may say the movie was just too long, I loved every minute of it!
B00028HBKM|2.0|I am not cold, nor am I without heart.  I cringe when I watch this movie.  I weep to think that this would happen to the most guilty of men let alone a good man who's done nothing to deserve it.  And though I am not a Christian I respect the story of Jesus.  But, this is the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen portraying his life.<br /><br />99% of the story, the dialog, and the violence is not an accurate portrayal.  It's not just that most of the story is made up or isn't accurate according to the Bible, but most of the dialog is made up too.  Most of what is supposed to be from the Gospels is altered in some way to say something other that what scripture says.<br /><br />The violence in itself is another story.  Though it is told that Jesus was tortured and suffered, the violence depicted in the movie just isn't realistic.  It's not just that 99% of it isn't mentioned in the Bible, but there is no way on Earth that Jesus could have survived 20 minutes into the movie.  If he hadn't bled to death first, the fishhook type whips used on him would not only have ripped his flesh off his body, but gone in and ripped out his internal organs too.  It's just not realistic.  No one could have survived that.  Not even the Son of God.<br /><br />The portrayal of the Roman soldiers that beat Jesus wasn't realistic either.  I know that the Roman soldiers were cruel and could be sadistic but the way they are portrayed in this film is as much over the top as all the violence.  The Bible mentions nothing of all this punishment.  He wasn't beaten and whipped and kicked around the way they showed as he carried his cross to Calvary.  He fell three (3) times.  And most of the portrayal that went on with him being nailed to the cross and set up isn't mentioned at all.  Him being flipped over the way he was.  Geez!<br /><br />What this movie blatantly is, is an attempt to play on the emotions of those who believe so deeply in the story of Jesus.  Period.  It's false propaganda and it plays its part well.  You can tell by all the reviews stating this was the most realistic version they'd ever seen.  Don't buy into it.<br /><br />Any Christian who is interested in watching a more accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus would be far better off watching Jesus of Nazareth.  Or any non-Christian who's just interested in learning about Jesus' life.  The real purpose of Jesus' life is portrayed in Jesus of Nazareth, and done very well.  His teachings.  That is what is really important, not this excessively violent and unrealistic version.<br /><br />I'm giving this movie two stars because of the use of Aramaic and Latin, and because the cinematography was beautiful.  Oh, and because the rendition of Satan was really creepy.tell by all the reviews stating this was the most realistic version they'd ever seen.  Don't buy into it.

0767903862|5.0|What stands out about this book for me is that it stays with me. I often find myself referring back to it, telling people stories I read in it, chuckling about something in it. It helps that I appreciate Bryson's humor, his hypochondria and morbidity and his delight in the ridiculous. And since it is a travel book, its only fair to say that since I read his book, I went to see some of the things he saw, and I mean to see more of them.

B00005BL2A|2.0|I'm a fan since 1987's Music for the Masses. I'm totally devoted to Depeche Mode, but it's 2007 and Exciter strikes as their worst CD ever. I'm not that fond of A Broken Frame, but there's an innocence to that album that enlightens and lets the listener aware that there's a bright future ahead for this band.<br />Exciter is a complete joke. The songs are truly uninspired, the lyrics are lame -Gore seems to drift away from his very intimate topics from all past Depeche albums- and, worst of all, Mark Bell has nothing to do with the somber and poppy mixture of sound that became DM's trademark. Tim Simenon did a hell of a job in translating the band to the late 90's. But Bell choose to get Bjorkesque on them. The result is a total lack of emotion.<br />For some reason I really like Sweetest Condition (bluesy and simple) and Freelove (seductive and quiet), but the rest of the album is so forgettable that nobody gave a damn when they failed to play any of its tracks on the Playing the Angel tour.<br />Every band has to suffer through a phase like this, but DM seemed as they have gone way above that curse for so long and... suddenly they fell from grace.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|The return of Loreena McKennitt after nine long years was truly much anticipated by her friends and admirers. Those people who have come to love her music and cherish her songs over all these years expected her new album with great enthusiasm and a feeling that characterizes one who awaits a long missing friend of the heart.     And how justified and happy they were to find out that their hopes and wishes had come true with no less than this spectacular masterpiece. For that is what \\"An Ancient Muse\\" actually is. Loreena comes forward once again to astonish us, enchant us, make us participants of the magical journey of the psyche to realms untethered to mundane reasoning. She comes like the fairy of stories old, yet through a modern perspective, and invites us to a ceremony of mysticism and passion, Love, celebration and even sacrifice.     She lifts the veils of mysteries hitherto hidden, mysteries she found out in her search in the spiritual, the emotional, the historical and above all the musical world and she calls us, one more time, to share the secrets..     Listening to \\"An Ancient Muse\\" fills one with a sense of optimism - that same sense of purpose - a sense of mysticism and freshness, a feeling of being lost in the swirl of sounds and emotions and yet again of rising above them to become witness of eternal truths and unspoken realities.    To anyone familiar with Loreena's music this album will bring the joys of her previous works along with the beauty of her music's evolution through the years.  To the one who has not yet listened to Loreena's music, but is willing to give it a try, this album will surely be a revelation.

B00000I0XW|4.0|I bought this CD ages ago for ALW's music. I'm a big fan of his work. Ms. Brightman does a lovely job on most of these songs, but like some people have said, her voice is too shrill. I much preferred Emmy Rossum's performance as Christine, I'm sorry, but Ms. Brightman's high notes penetrate my defenses and give me an awful headache sometimes. In my opinion, she sounds far lovlier on the lower songs.
0060763892|5.0|I have read just about every book written by James Rollins and in my opinion \\"The Judas Strain\\" is right up there at the top. It's a stunning and education portrait of those nasty bugs in the world of biological science. In the \\"The Judas Strain\\", the fourth novel in the Sigma Force series I thought Mr. Collins writing style captured the true effects of a loose deadly bacteria that is killing all life in the waters of Christmas Island. The story is full of action and the author had a way of drawing me into the characters; it was as if I knew them. I like that about an author. Off the top of my head the mega author Clive Cussler also a knack for strong character development and Mr. Collins in his own style has proved he knows a thing or two about developing character traits. There are enough quality reviews that detail the story, so I won't add more print, except to say that you will not find one of the main characters around for the next novel.

0553293397|4.0|The Naked Sun by, Isaac Asimov, is a direct sequel to [[ASIN:0553293400 Caves of Steel (Robot City)]].  Once again we see detective Elijah Baley called upon to solve a murder involving a \\"Spacer\\" (a human from an Earth colony on another planet) only this time he has to leave Earth to perform the investigation.  He is reunited with his robotic partner, R. Daneel Olivaw although the relationship seems a bit more contentious this time around.  The two meet on the planet Solaria where a leading citizen has been murdered with a good old-fashioned blunt instrument.  Baley must overcome his fear of open spaces, resistance from the locals to meeting face-to-face, and the seeming impossibility of satisfying all the facts of the case before he can shed light on the mystery.    More than just a mystery, Naked Sun is also a social commentary of sorts.  I can't say I found this aspect of the novel nearly as compelling as the mystery.  Without giving too much away, the people of Solaria live in nearly complete isolation and loathe being in the personal presence of anyone, including a spouse or their own child.  While this is plausible in a purely academic way given the scenario that Asimov put it place, it ignores many basic human instincts such as sex drive that are incredibly powerful and highly unlikely to be sublimated so completely.  Still, as long you take it with a grain of salt, it is still interesting to read about this other culture.      The murder mystery in the book was very well done for the most part.  It moves along well, introduces a number of interesting characters, and is suitably puzzling to both Baley and the reader as it unfolds.  The ending wasn't quite as tidy as it could have been but I'll say no more about that for fear of spoiling the story for new readers.    The Naked Sun is not a perfect novel.  The ending was just a bit off and the sociology is more than questionable.  But these are quibbles, not crippling flaws.  I would certainly recommend this book, though you should read Caves of Steel (and possibly I, Robot) first.  If you've read Caves of Steel, and enjoyed it, odds are you'll find a lot to like in this sequel.

Not to mention it makes a great doorstop..or a weapon...Although the photo shoots are a bit dated, and Schwarzenegger clearly has his own opinions on who makes the great bodybuilder list, the history is fun and the exercises are clearly described and photographed.  This book is great for all bodybuilders, male or female, novice or pro.

B000RG1DDA|5.0|While \\"Bookends\\" had many great tracks, this album for me is the better one in that it is much more coherent and flows better from track to track and has the bigger hits.  The title track is simply one of the best songs ever written while \\"The Boxer\\" is very good as well.  No fillers on this great album except for the live version of \\"Bye Bye Love\\" which I really wish was left out but in keeping with the larger theme of giving hints as to the duo's imminent breakup, I guess they had to have that track somewhere on the album.  \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\" is so obvious a message to Art Garfunkel, an architecture student, that Paul Simon wanted out that it's just a priceless track on this album and is one of my favourites.<br /><br />There are two bonus tracks here which are actually very good and unlike in most albums where the bonus tracks either do little or even take away from the overall enjoyment of the disc, this is not the case here as we get a very nice track: \\"Feuilles-O\\" in French and a very good demo version of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\" The remastering job is quite good too resulting in a good sound quality recording as well.<br /><br />Now this version of the album comes in a mini-lp sleeve replica with thin and not so good quality cardboard which is strange given the quality of the \\"Bookends\\" version is far superior and you would think it a simple matter to do at least the same with this album.  It also includes a 20-page booklet printed on glossy paper with all the lyrics and a 10-page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese as well. As far as mlps designs go, this one isn't all that great but I've seen even worse. Okay packaging, good sound quality makes this good value as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Simon & Garfunkel fans and definitely worth the \\"upgrade\\"!
B00006LJ6X|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - At the time Chicago VII was released, the band had already been stablished as a notorious public icon, and Chicago VII represented their comeback to the double album structure with 15 tracks, although Rhino remastered version takes care of it and stucks all its material in one cd. But much more important than being a double album, this is one of Chicago' most personal works, while they've been doing a set of different styles and steel they hadn't stablished in a genre, Chicago VII is such a personal release because of the fact that the band's interests in jazz music where high above their expectatives among critics and fame, so they just decided to give themselves a gift and release a set of material that really makes them happy, an album full of jazz music. None of the bandmates were actually recognized themselves as jazz musicians, but just because of the fact that this inclinnation for jazz was such a strong feeling inside them, its the perfect result for a soulful and deeply emotional work. Still, the same facts that even Chicago was waiting for were the ones which take off talent from the album, this jazzy experience that they went through wasn't pleasant among critics and fans, hence their intelligent producer James William Guercio had to put a certain pressure on the band for they to release the second cd of the album, which it contained a much more comprehensible, soft, pop and more commercially attractive set of songs, some of them reached to be very famous among their later career. On its set of jazzy songs, is quickly notorious in the opening songs their jazz interests, as it is obvious in the first three jazzy instrumental tracks: Prelude To Aire, Aire and Devil's Sweet, all three songs possess a great influence from latin jazz sounds, just as its remarkable the start of later collaborator Laudir DeOliveira, and the three songs are the perfect proof of drummer Danny Seraphine underrated ability and fierceful talent, Prelude To Aire is precisely the prelude to the later song Aire, and its based on a bunch of jazzy style drumming and latin influenced percussion, while Aire is the jazzy instrumental in the album which keeps their greatest jazz talent and potential material, and Devil's Sweet stands as the longest song in the album, being a ten minutes long jazzy instrumental, I think that instead of making the song musically heavy, Chicago was trying to express their deep inspirations on Jo and Elvis Jones, I don't know who they are but they are named in the song's dedication as a fact of their inspiration. The later two instrumentals are Lamm's compositions, Italian From New York is another jazzy instrumental with the higlight of possessing some rather wild electronic forays from Lamm, while the 'italian' in the song is actually DeOliveira, a cuban who joined the cuban navy and took a ship to Canada, although he was often caught by the authorities, he claimed he was an Italian from New York, and Hanky Panky is a very brief instrumental with the higlight of Cetera's best bass performance, being a vehicle for Pankow's trombone skills, while the later Life Saver is also Lamm's composition, being the first sang song in the album, its a funky, upbeat song. The laid back Happy Man is a Cetera's composition, while being a very famous song, its a much more soft with a romantic flavour, still jazzy, while James Pankow's autobiographical (I've been) Searching So Long stays as another big hit, telling about a young man discovering himself as a person, its a beautiful and recognizeable balladry with a touchy orchestration, and its adjoining Mongonucleosis is a much more enjoyable, party like song, everything but serious. Later comes Kath's two compositions in the album, Song Of The Evergreen and Byblos, Song Of The Evergreen is a very beautiful, sentimental and emotional song still with a powerful performance, is there such a sensitive theme as singing about evergreens? I don't think so..., while Byblos is a reference to a jazz club in Tokyo where Chicago played for a long while, its a very jazzy song with Kath on lead vocals, but is his dextrous acoustic guitar what makes the song a delight. Wishing You Were Here is another Cetera's composition, he wrote it while driving a motorcycle (?), and as Cetera's compositions are a commercial magnet, this beautifuly melodic and melancholic balladry went off as being another hit, while also having Beach Boys' Al Jardine, Dennis Wilson and Carl Wilson on the backing vocals, while being two straight ahead enemy bands, they were pretty close with significant collaborations, the perfect harmony between these two giants, and the following Call On Me was Loughnane first composition with Chicago, it went lucky as being a great hit, although I compare it a lot with the later Hot Streets' song No Tell Lover. The last two songs are both Lamm's compositions, Women Don't Want To Love Me and Skinny Boy, I really like Women Don't Want To Love Me undertaking, uncompromising and hopeful but joyful style even refering to dramatic theme, while Skinny Boy is very good song but its disco style The Pointer Systers' chorus really hits off my nerves. Anyway, Chicago VII is a very personal and experimental jazzy album, but don't get freaked out, this was their only one like this, later they followed their pop style, and it still possesses a bunch of very famous songs, which are the ones wich I recommend most, because that's how pop is, the most famous ones are the best ones (at least on this album), isn't it?eference to a jazz club in Tokyo where Chicago played for a long while, its a very jazzy song with Kath on lead vocals, but is his dextrous acoustic guitar what makes the song a delight.

B000RG1DD0|4.0|I know a lot of people love this as Simon & Garfunkel's best album but I have to say after listening to it a few times, I still can't see how this is better than \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\"  As far as this being a concept album with aging as a theme goes, this is pretty good but I can't shake the feeling off that this sounds very uncohesive as the tracks don't flow very well like I'd expect classic albums to with the exception of perhaps The Beatles' \\"White Album\\".  As a guitarist myself, I'll admit that the Bookends Theme is a nice piece to play but otherwise, this sounds like they were frantically looking at throwing an album together and to make it at least 30 minutes long.<br /><br />The \\"Bookends\\" theme comes up twice and \\"Old Friends\\" although a great track is just an expansion upon the \\"Bookends\\" theme.  \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", \\"A Hazy Shade of Winter\\" and \\"At the Zoo\\" while all great individual hits just don't seem to fit here too and sound like they would be better suited to the \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" album.  There are two bonus tracks here: \\"You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies\\" and yet another version of \\"Old Friends\\" and yet the album still feels very short.  That said, all the tracks are very good to listen to and there are really no fillers here and so in that regard i.e. every track is good, I'll admit that this is S&G's best album as even \\"Bridge ...\\" had a couple of fillers like \\"Bye Bye Love.\\"<br /><br />The remastering job is well done though which means the sound quality is very good considering the original master must be almost 40 years old by now.  Now this version of the album comes in a very well designed mini-lp sleeve replica with good quality cardboard and fine detailed representation of the original lp sleeve right down to the inner sleeve. It also includes a 16-page booklet printed on glossy paper with all the lyrics. There is also a very nice colour poster that opens up about 1 foot by half foot in measurement.  There is also another 14-page booklet of all the lyrics in Japanese.  As far as mlps designs go, this one ranks among the best and I wish all mlps releases can be this good.

B000069KE0|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Chicago early starts are mainly defined into the boundaries of meaningful, powerful and significant compositions, were their musical aproach is best defined by their popular interest, strongly meaningful songs defined by their way of protest against war and other abussive facts, so their music directions were build upon their earliest powerful and revolutionary spirit. Chicago Transit Authority represented great part of this reality, while having a nowadays unrecognizeable style and way of playing music, while in their marvelous debut album they were trying a unique approach and mainly waiting for the people to comprehend this message throughout music. Chicago II represented a great part of this musical displays, and as their early message was captured, in Chicago II they stand in their highest musical approach, already defined as a recognized band, and this album is the result of such an extremely interested band, as they has stated, at this point of their career they were working 300 days a year, but their still unbreakable spirit lead them to compose, even in the hardest conditions, their greatest masterpiece ever released, Chicago II, as most of the music in the album was composed while flying in airplanes or in road aside motels, and just because of their commitment for their music and their message, this album is just a perfect masterpiece. But Chicago was much more than a bunch of hippies singing anti-war rock songs, oh no, they were a musicaly interested band, which, apart from expressing their own messages through their songs, they could apply at the same time their best and most acclaimed way of playing music, still their messages can be clearly heard in actual times. Anyway, entering more into the album's music, this is certainly their most acclaimed, fantastic, profound and beautiful release of all times, its flawless, meaningful and significant compositions can be clearly recognized, plus the fact that everyone in the band who wanted to write a fragment could do it, so they were no actual tensions in terms of who was going to write the songs, as it can be seen compositions from Pankow, Kath, Lamm, Parazaider and Cetera. The album's first 5 songs are uncompromising introductions to the album's intention, they're very alike with Chicago Transit Authority style, best reflected in the opening Movin' In, later going to the more melodic The Road, and the dramatic, profound but comprehensible Lamm' composition Poem For The People, while In The Country has a certain level of patriotism in its words, but its vocal surprises are the ones which are really valuable, and Wake Up Sunshine stands as a more melodic, uncompromising and joyful composition. All in all, obviously the best composition Chicago ever wrote is Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon, while being a song mainly composed by virtuos trombone player James Pankow, its a 15 minutes long composition. The song was actually not intended to be divided in different fragments or singles, as this fact was a commercial idea of producer James William Guercio, and in commercial terms, this really worked, as some of its singles were extremely \\"radio friendly\\", just as singles Make Me Smile, Colour My World and 25 Or 6 To 4, but anyway, this song is much more enjoyable when its heard completely without fragments, although the main problem that it presents is the some times dissonant cohersion between its fragments. Dividing Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon, the first 6 fragments are all composed by James Pankow, when it all starts with the major hit Make Me Smile, an emotional and recognizeable composition with still such a sixties flavour, while the following So Much To Say, So Much To Give starts very good, and just when it seems its about to really start, it starts Anxiety Moment, just as the title expresses it, its anxious atmosphere and chilly instrumentation is fantastic, and after its one minute and a half long, it enters the catchy and relaxing instrumentalfragment Virginia Fantasies. The famous Colour My World stays as one of their best and most influenced compositions, with its arpeggio inspired in Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, its one of their deepest, most dramatic song, with Parazaider perfect flute interlude cooling off the song's deep moods, while To Be Free is an uncompromising, light instrumental break, connecting to the recalling instrumental Now More Than Ever, recalling little fragments from Make Me Smile. Later on, Lamm's two compositions come into Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon, being both Fancy Colours, which is a very virtuos but underrated song, starting with an intricate instrumental prelude, later going through the vocal duties, and ending with a total turn into a joyful, enjoyable and moody fragment, best expressed in Paradaizer marvelous flute, and the super hit 25 Or 6 To 4, is a moody, fast paced and rocker song sang by Peter Cetera, but don't make yourself rumors, just as Lamm states \\"25 Or 6 To 4 is what it is, a song! People trying to find out any type of secret meaning is just funny to me\\". Ending the masterpiece, it comes the last four fragments composed by Terry Kath, the four of them are serious fully orchestrated instrumentals, while the last fragment, Memories Of Love, is the one with the most potential, specially its dextrous, non electric guitar fancy touches among the song. Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon comes to an end, and while it wasn't any serious meaning in 25 Or 6 To 4, its difficult to ignore the anti Vietnam war hidden lines in It Better End Soon, in which all the four movements are meaningful and potential songs, while the last song, Where Do We Go From Here, is their greatest pop inclinnation, as composed by Peter Cetera, its notorious that Chicago later pop basis was obviously the result of Cetera's compositions, as he later became the front man, in this album he is everything but the frontman. All the seven musicians were at the top of their game in this album, and its musical performance is difficult to find in later Chicago albums. Chicago II is certainly their greatest masterpiece, while its cohersion is still a little bit awkward, its still a difficult album, Chicago pop era fans I'm not sure if they'll like this one, although its such a perfect and beautiful album that it must be in every Chicago fan's collection, still a meaningful release, and their most acclaimed one.fragment Virginia Fantasies.

B000002LEE|5.0|Jane's Addiction is good at writing epic pieces of music. Long, with multiple parts, and a lot of dynamic shifts. Which is exactly what makes \\"Ted, Just Admit It...\\" one of my favorite JA tracks. About serial killer Ted Bundy, it's pretty much everything a song of similar length and stature should be: dramatic, thought provoking, and unpredictable. And ambiguous - I'm not sure if Ferrel is endorsing or damming his actions. But I do like the song. That much I know. \\"Summertime Rolls\\" also has that mythic sweep, building from near silence to a Zep-like ballad - I can certainly hear the \\"Rain Song\\" influence in it. It's just majestic. Seems like hyperbole, but I don't know what else to say.  If you're not into epic songs, don't worry, because there's a lot of just plain rock `n' roll: \\"Ocean Sized\\"; \\"Had a Dad\\" and \\"Mountain Song\\" are like Led Zeppelin for the alt-rock era. Only I think the guitar solo on \\"Mountain Song\\" is better than anything Jimmy Page ever played, because I'm probably the only fan of both Jane's Addiction and Led Zeppelin that prefers Jane's Addiction greatly. They even involve a sax section on \\"Idiots Rule\\", which is otherwise just another great heavy rocker. One of my favorites, in fact. Not as good as \\"Jane Says\\", though. An acoustic ballad with a steel drum and a brutally honest, but sympathetic, portrayal of a struggling junkie. And it really resonates. It's locked in an endless deathmatch with \\"Three Days\\" as my favorite Jane's Addiction song. Now I don't like \\"Pig's in Zen\\" much. It's massively popular, but I think it's rather stupid. The jokey, ragtime novelty \\"Thank You Boys\\" isn't much better, and \\"Standing in the Shower... Thinking\\" overdoses on wah-wah. Still, this is an amazing album. Only Ritual de lo Habitual is better in the Jane's Addiction catalogue.

God bless the friend that gave this album to me for my birthday, else I probably would've never bought this album and delved into all of its wonderfully melodic genius. Not a single track on this album is guilty of being boring, monotonous, or half-baked, and consequently I am enamored by it. The mood, the grooves, the lyrics --- it all meshes very well to form a very enjoyable musical trek. High & Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, (Nice Dream) -- these songs are absolutely beautiful. Although they are obviously in two different leagues, if you consider yourself a fan of one the day's most  pretentious of British bands like, uhm, let's see --- Coldplay, then you will no doubt love this. Chris Martin and Co. can't hold a candle to it, even if they ARE guilty of ripping off their style and sound.

B000055YG6|4.0|American Beauty is a spectacular movie of hope and life that has captured the hearts of so many people. Sam Mendes, the director, and Alan Ball, the screenwriter, both succeed in displaying the lonely life of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man who takes a closer look at the world he lives in, and progresses on a journey to get his life back. The beginning tone of the movie is dull and uninspiring as Lester Burnham embarks on another boring day. He is seen as a prisoner looking out onto a world of beauty, a world that he once knew. He seems to be trapped behind bars everywhere he goes.       Sam Mendes was born in Reading, England in 1965. American Beauty was his first feature film in 1999 and it won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. He is now happily married to actress Kate Winslet. They have one child.      In the beginning of the movie during Lester's monologue, the audience finds out he is going to die, but at this point he seems already dead. His life is lonely and he has a low and tense relationship with his wife and daughter. Every aspect of this broken family is distant and isolated. Colors are dark and dull except for the red roses that so regularly appear throughout the course of the movie. The roses in the movie represent fantasy and life. The life of a rose depicts the direction of the movie and also the life of Lester. A rose begins as only a seed, waiting to be nurtured and cared for. It then transforms into a bud after it has grown and grown, and is only seconds away from blooming into the next phase - the American beauty. After the rose has had its beauty, it dies, satisfied and fulfilled because not only did it live, it lived a life of beauty.       Throughout the course of the movie and the introduction of all the characters, one specific character stands out more than any. Ricky, a teenage kid and the Burnham's new neighbor, brings light and beauty to the suburban family. He influences every character, directly and/or indirectly, and shows them how beautiful life really is. Lester begins to break free from his life of imprisonment and manages to live life without a care in the world. At one point Lester states, \\"I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.\\" This movie illustrates that there are always preconceived notions about people and life, but in reality, there is usually a lot more going on. People are always searching for meaning in their lives, and Lester Burnham finds that meaning... that beauty.       American Beauty is a movie that will surely touch the lives of anyone who should watch it. It is a film that can be viewed by both young and old and never cease to send a beautiful message.

It presents material in just the way it says it will, not a lot of techno babble, just to the point hints, explained in easy to understand language.  It's an easy read and well indexed for when you  return looking for a specific point.    I could do with a little less gratuitous humor, but skimmed past it for the nuggets Scott has to offer.    I was concerned whether it would be useful since I have a Nikon 8800 which is an all in one camera with many features but no interchangeable lenses.  It was call a prosumer Digital SLR when I bought it, but that designation, along with the model, is no longer being promoted.  Scott's advice related just as much to the 8800 as to more sophisticated models.

0141182601|5.0|If you are looking for a simple and straightforward novel, then this is not it.<br /><br />This is a piece of literature as art by the talented British writer Anthony Burgess (1917 to 1993).  I got interested in Burgess from his non-fiction works on Shakespeare and Joyce.<br /><br />Even the title here is complex, and According to Burgess himself, the title is from an old Cockney expression \\"as queer as a clockwork orange. Burgess wrote in his later that a creature who can only perform good or evil is \\"a clockwork orange -- meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with color and juice, but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil; or the almighty state.\\"<br /><br />So, the novel is about good and evil and as a vehicle he uses a young man Alex, who leads a life of crime and random violence including rape. He sets the story in the future but using realism. Alex narrates the tale and does so in a language called \\"Nadstat\\" which is not English but a sort of street slang. That adds to the ambiance or flavour or  setting of the story.<br /><br />The novel contains three parts: the narrative on Alex and his illegal activity or street crimes,  the imprisonment and attempted rehabilitaion of Alex, and finally the retribution of his victims.<br /><br />What does it all mean? First and foremost it is a work of art so keep that in mind. It includes various themes such as the power struggles between old and young generations, the corruption of social institutions, and  politics. It is supposed to make us think about the direction of society as a whole.

0385333846|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (1922 to 2007) was an American novelist known for works blending satire, black comedy, and science fiction, all intertwined. He was larger than life and very unconventional. He is recognised for three important novels: the present work, Cat's Cradle, and Breakfast of Champions. His main attribute as a novelist involved the ability to cross lines melding reality with science fiction and still have works that were considered important works of literature.<br /><br />As a reader the most startling thing for myself was that he spends chapter one talking directly to the reader giving a background introduction to the novel, and then he uses an imaginative plot to make his point.

When I got home from the Second World War twenty-three years ago, I thought it would be easy for me to write about the destruction of Dresden, since all I would have to do would be to report what I had seen.

0800141660|5.0|The worst thing a person can do is underestimate Jane Austen.  Though it is true that her stories center on young women and their romantic struggles, her works are not mere romance novels.  This film does a wonderful job of demonstrating that.    Emma Thompson is a wonderful actress and she really brings Elinor to life.  At times she seems almost cold and unfeeling but she is actually a woman who keeps her own counsel and who is very aware of how society views young women.  Better to be thought a cold woman than to make a mockery of herself in the eyes of others.  Thompson is at her best in those brief moments when Elinor is alone, when she is gazing sadly at her sister while she plays pianoforte, when she is alone in her room and running her fingers over the monogram embroidered on a handkerchief.  Elinor is actually quite a complex character, a woman who loves deeply and wholly but who is also very self and socially aware.    Her polar opposite is her sister Marianne and Kate Winslet is simply perfect in the role.  She captures Marianne's youthful exuberance and the blissful lack of awareness that she has for what others think of her.  In this day and age, such individuality would be encouraged but in Marianne's time it is seen as a fatal flaw, one that risks making her the target of ridicule of others.  She follows her heart over her head, unlike Elinor.  As the title indicate, Marianne is all sensibility while her sister is all sense.    Hugh Grant does a nice job of portraying the somewhat socially awkward and very shy Edward.  He always looks uncomfortable in his skin and only seems to relax when he is with Elinor or when he is brushing up on his sword wielding skills with Margaret.  Edward exemplifies the plight of the younger sons of the era, the need to please the family in order to maintain his position.  This was not a time when going it alone was encouraged or even feasible.  It is Edward's sense of honor and duty that are almost his undoing and, in someways, his situation is no better than that of the women.  Though he is ostensibly free to choose his profession, he is actually quite subject to the whims of his mother and his vicious social-climbing sister.    The most surprising and rewarding bits of casting lie with Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon.  His world weariness and deep sadness are visible in every line of Rickman's face.  He has seen what society can do to a young woman determined to follow her passions as Marianne is and it has left a deep impression upon him.  Though Elinor has a good grasp of the world, Brandon understands it even better and one of the finest scenes of the movie is the one in which he chides Elinor not to wish for her sister to become acquainted with the ways of the world.    Emma Thompson did a fine job of writing the screenplay for this movie, cutting out some of the less essential bits and lifting quite a bit of the dialogue directly from the text.  Ang Lee's direction is lovely and his shots are framed with such care.  Often his cast doesn't even need to speak, they simply need to observe and Lee does a wonderful job of capturing the characters' emotions in their quieter moments.
0780622650|4.0|You have to judge this movie purely on it's own merits. Forget about what it's based on. I liked the actors but not the childish dialogue or the Mimi Rogers speeches. I liked the ambitious tone and look of the movie. The science is plausible tho highly improbable. Hyper space(higher dimensional space) and time travel(to the future) are theoretical concepts and most likely where they'll forever stay. Dr. Smith is an excellent scoundrel given contradictory lines. At first it's political belief and then it's 'evil knows evil'. Like I said, the dialogue in this film is very 'Hollywood'(catch phrases substituting for substance). The movie is too short. It never gives you a chance to savor. The cute little alien is never explained. Where did it come from ? How the heck did it get there ? The primary demographic is the 10 year old suburban kid but in targeting that demographic you also get the rest of the family because the kids can't drive themselves to the theatre. Ofcourse but through all it's obvious flaws, I still kind of like this movie. I also like the way the theme song was remade. Call it a visceral thing if you will but I won't be giving this one away anytime soon.
B0001I55OC|4.0|\\"Timeline\\" by Michael Crichton is one of my favorite books! The movie is just slightly different (due to time constraints), but it is a well done and fun movie. The costumes are awesome, and finding out they used a real castle and real trebuchets made the movie even more interesting for me. The acting, for the most part was good, but could have been better. I would like to see this movie done with a better cast...Brad Pitt as Chris, Sean Connery as the Professor, Cameron Diaz as Kate, Antonio Banderas as Andre Marek, and Seth Green as David Stern, would be my top picks to star in a remake!    I thought the effects were great! This is just a fun to watch movie, with a great story and I could watch it many times without losing interest. Great movie for teens to pique their interest in history and/or science fiction too.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I don't know what film others saw, but the one I saw four times is at least as good as the previous two in the series, and a very satisfying wrap up to the entire trilogy story line.  No Action?  Hunh?  It has just as much edge-of-your-seat action as you could hope for.  Too many villians?  That's just plain stupid (especially considering how one of the \\"villians\\" is redeemed.)  In fact, as best as I can determine, folks who voice disatisfaction in this film do so because it is truly a story of redemption and forgiveness, and apparently people would have preferred murder and mayhem (there's plenty of that out there, so if that's what you want, then I agree that Spidey 3 isn't for thee.)  And with regard to the person who said that this film was all about \\"revenge\\" getting \\"shoved in our faces\\" -- well, actually it's about the \\"danger of revenge\\" and turns the table on that attitude in a great conclusion that brings tears to your eyes (or ought to, anyway.)  I've never bothered to write a review before, but it really has gotten under my skin how many critical pans this film has received that are just plain senseless and, frankly, ignorant.  Let this set the record straight.  Watch all three together and you've got one great story set:  1, 2 AND 3 -- without exception.
B00065MDSG|5.0|I don't want to go into detail about about this album suffice it to say that it is brilliant and has lost nothing of its impact over the years since I first heard it.

B00005JPFH|3.0|The sad facts: 1 too many villains, 2 Tobey Maguire's dark side was comical, 3 what happened to the magic from the second film? 4 The ending sucked so hard the devil wept, 5 came real close to Batman and robin

1582701709|5.0|I really enjoyed reading \\"The Secret\\" and also viewing the dvd.  I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews out there.  This is a wonderful concept(the law of attraction...) that I have been interested in long before this book was published.  I have read many of the books out there, and find this to be amongst my favorites.  I have personally found this book to be life changing.  Don't take my word for it.  Pick up a copy and find out for yourself.  Happy reading and happy living!
B0002IQJUK|4.0|Great CD. I purchased this CD because I love the popular tracks on it (Follow through...), after listening to it a few times I found that even the other songs, that were not as popular, are extraordinary!
B000ROALCG|5.0|Ever since i purchased this cd i haven't stop listening to it. I recommend this cd to anyone who is a big fan of Marc & jennifer. I don't regret buying it.
B0006N2EZ0|3.0|I still love this movie no matter how many times I watch it.  However on the QUALITY of this dvd; I am a bit dissapointed - it froze on a particular sceen - that one where Whitney Houston performed on stage in front of a rowdy crowd.  The scene kept on freezing no matter what I did.  I had to skip the entire scene to finish the rest of the movie.
B0000042H4|4.0|Great performances by all, unsurpassed by any other I've heard, plus wonderful sound effects, but the original sound has been somewhat degraded by a \\"de-hissing\\" process, compared with the original CD of excerpts. Too bad.
B0000071GA|5.0|Krokus, for some reason, seem to be a band you either love or hate. I enjoy a lot of their music but this CD is their finest hour. From the moment you put this music on you are surrounded by great song writing and excellent melodies. The guitars are clear and crisp and the music is heavy. \\"Stayed Awake All Night\\",\\"Night Wolf\\",and \\"Russian Winter\\" all pound it out and they aren't even the biggest hits on this gem. This CD is a must for every classic metal fan. If you don't already own this go buy it. If you're a Krokus hater you'll still appreciate what these guys accomplished here.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|i did not understand, and possibly it was naive on my part, that the hd/dvd will not play on most dvd players. i tried it on 5 different dvd players before i investigated further and found only a couple of manufacurers of these machines. i was able to return the dvd to amazon though without any problems for credit.
0307155102|5.0|My son loves this book.  He leafs through the pages, studying the pictures, and he loves to point at items and say the name.  He loves this book so much that we also purchased Scarry's \\"Things That Go\\" which he loves even more!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|The Straight Story is an Indy film worthy of giving as a gift to a special adult brother or sister who may not have always gotten along.  it is an inspiration and a testimonial to the importance of family.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is absolutely wonderful. My 5 year old son learned how to play in practically no time, and he is willing to play again and again, practically every day. The game helps in developing logical and strategy skills, as well as \\"dimensional vision\\" which I believe is very important. And by the way, did I mention, it is fun to play? Not only for kids, but for adults too. A+++.
0743267478|4.0|In his debut novel, Vikas Swarup, an Indian diplomat, tells about life in modern India from the viewpoint of an orphan who changes several places of residence and jobs during his teen years.    The story is not told in a conventional way, however. The presentation is very original - in the beginning we find out that Ram Muhammad Thomas was arrested after having won the biggest television Q & A show in India (and the world), winning 1 billion rupees (24 million US dollars, by today's rate). He was arrested because being just a poor 18-year old orphan working as a waiter who won a difficult quiz show, the show organizers suspected he was cheating.    However, and this is how the plot unfolds, Ram wasn't cheating. Rather, by a sheer coincidence, all the questions touched on topics he knew about from discrete incidents in the past few years of his life. As he sits in the police department with a lawyer, he tells her about each episode, after which they see the recording of the relevant question of the show.    If the original way of presentation was the only good thing about the book, it would only be average. However, the book also provides an exciting and fascinating glimpse into the life in modern India. Well written and full of both common day-life and historical facts about the densely populated peninsula, it is both pleasant to read and provides lots of interesting information. Recommended.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I just love this show! The only thing that bothers me is that not only did they cancel show only after 19 episodes but they left you with one major unanswered question.... What did Angela do after she found out Brian was writing the love letters for Jordan? When it was finally revealed to her that Brian was in love with her?! That is so wrong to leave you with a cliffhanger and no next season to resolve it. We deserve to know, if only in writing what happened with that. Other than that the show was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to own it!
B0000634EV|4.0|This is really a great album that I believe surpasses its predecessor.  As a Mississippi native that has spent a great deal of time traversing Highway 49  and I-59, I have heard few albums that encompass the feel of the area like this album.  I think that is something that a lot of people miss who gripe about the stylistic twists and turn on this set.  This is a snap shot of not just Southern rock, but more particularly everything that is the swamp and the coast metal scene.  I love it for that reason.    Songs like Stained Glass Cross and Lies just drip with the groove/jazz vibe of New Orleans.  Other songs like Beautifully Depressed and the stripped down Where I'm going reveal a deep blues sensibility (I think the latter is a very well done bit of delta music really).  Other songs like New Orleans is a Dying Whore and There's Something on My Side are classic dirty coast metal.  I can understand how to someone unfamiliar with the area might think none of this makes sense together, but to me it does perfectly.  It's all little jewels formed from the influences that one is absolutely steeped in if you grow in the area.  Landing On The Mountains Of Meggido is a nice psychedelic send off for a good album.    The only reason I would shave a half of a star is that the songs do occasionally wander promising something they never quite deliver.  All and all it is a great album, and an interesting progression from NOLA.  I am excited to see what they third will bring.
0316067598|5.0|Simply the best, most inspirational book i have ever read. Makes you realize how tough these guys really are, and how much our media makes them out to be heroes only when it's convinient for them or their story, and are quick to place blame at the first drop of a \\"civilian\\" casualty. I think all the leftest anti-war, who say treat the enemy as you would treat your own, need to read this book and study every line. Maybe then they will realize that in order to conquer the enemy we cannot play by rules that don't apply to them. Makes you want to waterboard more people than just Khaled Sheik Mohammad.
B0001DMPVI|5.0|When this album came out (It had a different cover; a line drawing of Eric in a \\"through the looking glass\\" style) I wondered if it would be any good. I took a chance and bought it. I was not disappointed. Every cut was good, but some were GREAT. Everyone I know loves Sky Pilot, and Monterey was an instant hit, but the mood evoked by We Love You Lil and Orange and Red Beams is amazing. Don't get me wrong, The Animals did a slew of excellent songs over the years but I am particularly fond of this album. Maybe because of the era in which it was recorded and released to its fans. In a time of great confusion in our lives, or maybe it was something deeper than even that. No matter, it was great and I am grateful for it. If you want to hear Burdon in a not-so-mainstream vein and still enjoy his music, buy this album. You won't be disappointed.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|Superman-The Movie is a one of a kind film that isn't hardly made anymore. The movie is a classic, it hasn't aged at all and it is never boring (no matter how many times I watch it). The cast is perfect for the story and the story itself is excellent. There is just a really great scene towards the end of the movie when Superman gets really angry. You can literally feel the rage coming off the screen.<br /><br />There are just so many special effects in this movie that are simply breath-taking, especially if you compare it to the films of the same year and decade. Just the ability to make Superman fly was an amazing stunt, but there are so many other things in the film that are equally cool. Some of my favorite scenes of the film are the helicopter scene, then there is the scene when Superman goes through the Earth's core and just the special effects used during Lex Luthor's test of Superman. It is just cool to see the bullets bounce off of the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Overall, this is just a beautiful film that is totally worth buying, especially with all of the extras this DVD has.
B00008BRBG|5.0|You can't discredit ANY Police album, even their weakest effort Ghost in the Machine which, aside from having the three worst Police songs in a row (Hungry For You, Demolition Man, Too Much Information), is chock full of signature classics and solid material that, like the best material on all of their albums, wouldn't quite sound at home on any of the other four albums. The worst thing you could say about any Police album is that it doesn't have a classic song from another Police album. The songs themselves are just that great. And although my absolute favourite Police songs come later, and I consider every Police album solid through and through, the first one, I think, really was the most impressive in using every minute available to create a truly unique listening experience. Every single track is a winner.    You got the great rockers Next To You, Hole in My Life and Truth Hits Everybody. Next To You and Hole in My Life both showcase Stewart Copeland's versatility at the kit. In the former's case, his ability to play around with a simple song and experiment creatively. In the latter's case, he plays a truly original drum beat that really rocks and makes the song what it is.    You have the three Police-iest songs ever, all on the same album, Roxanne, Can't Stand Losing You and the sublime So Lonely. Not every signature Police classic can be on the same album, but with all three of these winners on the same album, who could ask for anything more?    And the more quirky Peanuts and Be My Girl - Sally showing that The Police's songwriting wins; quirky or serious. Peanuts, like Synchronicity II later, is compositionally very complex with a lot of interweaving sections but still manages to succeed as a good, solid pop song. The Be My Girl section of By My Girl - Sally (the Sting penned section) on the other hand, is as simple as a song can be, and is every bit as solid.    Born in the 50's is the furthest thing from filler. On many other albums it'd probably be the standout track, but here it's just one more among nine other gems. The whole album never lets up. Nothing on it is anything short of amazing, and that's what sets Outlandos d'Amour apart. They don't waste a single second, giving you a listening experience unlike any other on the planet earth.    Rounding the whole thing out is the bizarre Masoko Tanga, a landmark Police track unlike anything else they've ever done, or anybody's ever done really. To hear it is to believe it, it's an utterly unique piece of music. It's well-crafted and grooves in an unearthly way, with those signature Andy Summers block chords on beat 2 and 4 forcing me to bop my head in time every time I hear it. Where Don't Stand So Close to Me, Message in a Bottle or Every Breath You Take are Police classics, Masoko Tanga is a Police masterpiece.    This is the place to start with The Police for sure. An amazing listening experience that always seems too short.
0679746323|2.0|Before I started reading this book I had great expectations. I knew nothing about Mao at the time and this book seemed like a good place to start. This was a mistake. To make it short, the author's aim is not to tell the story of Mao, but to break his reputation. According to the author, Mao did not believe in communism, he just happened to join the communist party (although when he did join there were very few members and nothing really worth to take advantage of), he was not a great military commander (the writer explains that in all the battles that Mao won, he won because those that were against him were either spies or idiots, or because he was lucky, or because someone from the communist party did all the work and Mao took credit). The author also tried to tell us that Mao was lucky to acquire the nuclear bomb and he actually miscalculated but as in most cases luck was by his side. The issue that the writer really failed to tackle was that when Mao came to power China was in a terrible mess and no one really ruled it. The Russians and the Japanese attacked when they wished and no one could stop them. By the time Mao died China was one of the strongest countries in the world and was united under a single leadership. Yes Mao was a mass murderer, but that doesnt mean he cant be smart or calculating.
B00005JMK0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and the soundtrack (Culture Club Love is Love) Awesome!!!
B000024D4R|5.0|This is another great album. Not quite in the same league as Dark Side or Wish You Were Here. Those I can (and have) listen to all day. This one gets boring after 5 or 6 plays in a row (yes, I do like Pink Floyd!).
B000P0J024|3.0|When i get this item i was very sad. Quality of videos low like mp4. I don't understand why this great band maded clips in so low quality. I have many videos 1988-1990 much better quality. I have TV 31 widescreen and i can wath this without tears. I'm very sorry that one of my favorit bands made so low quality product.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|Obviously badly dated, but a fine example of what a good filmmaker is able to do with an unusual (hey, it was the first of its kind) story, and the support of a talented cast.  At almost every level, very little weakness to be found.
0761129235|5.0|I love this book for its succinct nature, great examples, and thought-provoking content.  It offers a fresh perspective on how to set the stage for not only more success, but also a more pleasant journey toward success.  Filled with both good principles and good examples, this is a lightening-quick read that holds lots of gems for self-improvement.  It's a great tool for professionals to learn new techniques for helping their clients.  Highly recommended.
B00004SU5J|4.0|Mainly the reason that this often referenced House/Jazz fusion project continues to be so widely regarded even seven years after release remains the fantastic programming to be found throughout. It seems like such an obvious, simple concept..to mix live experienced studio players and vocalists with the deceptively simple and elegant beats, though Tourist still holds some of the highest standards when mixing these two elements, despite an onslaught of so much lesser inspired, similar themed music. Having hardly dated in what is in electro-years a long time, the graceful and classy take on electronic music has stood the test of time simply for the musical quality ingrained in the extended samples which play front and center to Tourist's sleek backgrounds. Although not all tracks can conjure up the magic that lies in say, track 6, even on autopilot Tourist stands as a high water mark for house-styled electronica.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is one of my favorite animated pictures I've ever seen and I've seen it over a hundred times. There was a time when all my kids ever wanted to watch was NEMO! The animation is riveting, the characters are unforgettable, the story is beautiful and the humor is marvelous for kids and adults and never crosses the line. What I loved about this was it fell into line with what you would expect from fish and all the other creatures that you come across and never crossed a line into absurd or in tongue, sarcastic humor like some other fish movies I've seen. A fathers love is so strong for his son drives this film and in what has to be the funniest supporting fish, um..actress in an animated film I've ever seen. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory is amazing.
B0002858YS|5.0|Awsome music, every song is great, is a must have for every rock fan. They are not a small band anymore, but sure I supported them  since the beginning
B00003CXB2|5.0|what more can be said about one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces in film history. The kind of film that could never be made today. Peter O'Toole is astonishing, Omar Shariff is mesmerising, Anthony Quinn amazing. The score by Maurice Jarre is legendary. The bigger the screen the better the viewing. There are some cinematic shots here that will literally take your breath away.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|perfect quality for best price...it even comes packaged better as the normal 10 season series...its worth it
0385338902|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed with any of Jonathan Tropper's novels.  I love his wit and his emotion.  In this novel, Tropper again created an interesting cast of a characters, and a soulful narrator to put it all in perspective.  Doug Parker is up there on par with Joe Goffman.  I wish they were real men so I could meet them!!!  Great book, keep writing Jonathan, I need more!!!
0060763892|4.0|No spoilers    I'm a huge James Rollins fan and as is the case with all of his recent novels, I eagerly awaited the release of The Judas Strain. After having it since it came out, I finally got the time to sit down and devour it and now I'm able to give a review.    To keep it short, I'll give some direct advice. If you've read Rollins before, you know what to expect and if you liked anything of his from the past then you'll enjoy this one too. The only complaint I can really lodge is that (as was the case at points in Map of Bones) he overdoes it on the scientific end to the point where you have to re-read a few passages to glean what it means. Besides that though, it's still a great read (Amazonia is still my favorite) so you should pick it up.    On the other hand, if you're new to Rollins, first you should pick up some of his older books, if for no other reasons so you can appreciate the development of the author. If you're going to ignore that and still read this first anyway and are wondering what kind of read it is, the description that is both most fitting and succinct is Dan Brown-esque adventure/thrills/mystery with a healthy dose of both fully realistic and quasi-realistic science.    Bottom line for fans both new and old is pick it up.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|How far can a person go down the rabbit hole?  Well . . . so far that all perspective and all thought of selfhood are either blurred or destroyed.  I loved this movie and haven't finished decoding its messages.  Although there are multiple stories going on (the polish folk tale, the unfinished movie, Nikki's role and Nikki's real life) they all converge at the bottom of the hole only to to be reborn back in the real world at the end of the movie.  For those who haven't seen the bonus disk, check out the deleted scenes.  There is one scene that lasts about 45 minutes that is critical to understanding the characters and the sub-plot concerning the unfinished '4-7'
0060833459|4.0|The breadth of Drucker's knowledge and insights never cease to amaze me, and goes to reinforce my perception - as well as that of many others - that he is, in fact, \\"the founding father of the science of management.\\" That's the reason I quoted him seven times - on seven different management topics - in by book, The Three Pillars of Sustainable Profit & Growth [[ASIN:0977802302 The Three Pillars of Sustainable Profit and Growth]].<br /><br />The essence of The Effective Executive is this: not too long ago, the business community was essentially engaged in manufacturing where the need was for efficiency - the ability to do things right.<br /><br />As our business world evolved into service and science-oriented enterprises, employees became \\"knowledge workers\\" as opposed to \\"manual workers.\\"  Thus, a whole new set of executive qualifications were required - the key one being effectiveness - the ability to get the right things done.<br /><br />He goes on to point out that intelligence, knowledge and imagination are common in most executives, and they were the primary qualities needed when our business world was engaged in manufacturing and manual workers. However, with the emergence of the service/science-oriented business world and the knowledge worker, these same qualities appear to have little correlation with an executive's effectiveness. Today's business world needs executives who can get the right things done.
0977326403|5.0|A friend mentioned Good to Great in a sermon and I thought it might be a worthwhile read for me as the executive director of a non-profit association facing the challenge of how take the organization to the next level.<br /><br />I found the book fascinating and will share it with my Board of Directors as a roadmap for how we will move our organization from good to great.<br /><br />The monograph provides a great overview of the concepts developed in the book and is of a very manageable length.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend it to leaders of non-profits as a basis for a conversation about their organization making the great leap forward.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I recently bought this for my dad for his birthday.  I remember watching it when I was younger and I always liked it, but the version we had was recorded from TV and was terrible quality, especially because it is now almost 20 years old.  It is an excellent series, but you can decide that for yourself if you choose to buy it.<br /><br />My decision to write this review is designed to help the potential buyer who doesn't want to get ripped off.  I read most of the reviews before buying this product, and time and time again I came accross people who complained about purchasing an edited version with much of the content removed.  Many of those reviews were old, so I didn't know if I was getting a newer version with the whole story of some other version that was edited.  Hopefully this will help.<br /><br />It appears that Amazon sells 2 versions of the DVD (I know nothing about the VHS versions so this review does not apply to them).  The version I bought (ASIN B00005Y6YB) is listed as 360 minutes in length and is ranked in the top 500 in Amazon's top sellers.  It was released by Hallmark.  The DVD box lists the run time as 6 hours, which is what you would expect after removing commercials an 8 hour TV miniseries that is split into 4 parts.  Amazon's price is listed as $8.49.<br /><br />Another version of the series (ASIN B00003IPFK) is listed as 360 minutes as well, but is listed at about #48,000 in the top sellers and is priced at $13.75 (only available from independent vendors).  Seeing how few people bought this version and how much more it costs, I would avoid it.<br /><br />The version I bought is ASIN B00005Y6YB and it is complete.  Perhaps the people who gave bad reviews did not receive the same version I bought.  Amazon lists the same reviews for both, so it's possible that people gave poor reviews to a different version and those reviews got mixed in with the complete version's reviews.  If you want to be sure you are getting the complete series without editing, I would recommend searching the ASIN so that you don't have to pick and choose between versions.  Be sure you check when you get the product that you have the full 6 hour version.  I hope this helps!
B000QQFKYE|5.0|The first time I watched INLAND EMPIRE, there would be times during the nearly 3-hour running time that I would have to get up to go pee or grab a beer or something. So I would stop the film ... and find myself unwilling to move. Instead I would gaze up at the mysterious TV lamp casting its glow on the wall, the ominous folding doors concealing the den next to the living room ... and suddenly my comfortable home environment felt vaguely threatening.<br /><br />Last night I began watching INLAND EMPIRE again, getting about halfway through the film before it was time to go to bed. Having plunged through it once already, I found myself free to simply watch rather than analyze, to simply listen to the exquisitely written dialogue rather than trying to puzzle out every nuance. And I found the film moving along a lot more quickly than the first time around.<br /><br />And make no mistake: INLAND EMPIRE is a lot to digest. I'm still working on it. But after two days and some additional viewing, I find myself appreciating the film much, MUCH more. The first time I watched it, I thought to myself, \\"There is a story here, but it is told in extremely unconventional terms.\\" And now I think there are several stories here that exist in a kind of orbital resonance and sharing themes of loss, guilt, and regret.<br /><br />Oddly enough, spinning like a neutron star (or perhaps an old acetate record) at the core of this film is a Polish gypsy folk tale cum movie script so cursed that it has the ability to suck its actors and characters into other realities and identities, shuffling them around mercilessly, and in the process causing us, as members of the audience, to question our own grip on what is real and what is fiction.<br /><br />There is the story of Nikki Grace, a veteran Hollywood actress with a chance to reclaim the limelight with the role of a lifetime. She ultimately falls victim to the aforementioned curse, losing both her identify and her marital fidelity. But how real is Nikki herself? She might in fact be nothing more than a DREAM of stardom, a fantasy concocted by a doomed Hollywood prostitute. In this regard INLAND EMPIRE shares some of the themes previously explored in David Lynch's previous film, \\"Mulholland Drive.\\"<br /><br />(Bill Macy, in a VERY brief appearance as a television announcer, utters what could possibly be the most telling line in the film, saying that Hollywood is \\"where DREAMS become STARS, and STARS become DREAMS!\\")<br /><br />There are other stories at work here: The prostitution ring in Hollywood may parallel a similar racket in Poland. We are teased with scenes from a Polish film that ultimately went uncompleted, the same film being remade with Nikki Grace (played brilliantly by Laura Dern) and Devon Burke (Justin Theroux). There are cryptic references throughout the film to something called \\"axonn.n\\" ... which, according to the first spoken words in INLAND EMPIRE, is the longest radio play in history. And then there are the rabbits (Trapped? Caged?) used as the films most surreal device.<br /><br />But to hell with all that. Ultimately what's really most important about INLAND EMPIRE is the art of filmmaking. Cinema is most often used to tell stories in the simplest, most conventional terms, just as oil paint on canvas is most often used to portray people, landscapes, and bowls of fruit. But both painting and cinema can be used in far more adventurous and experimental ways, even if such efforts are not commercially viable. I doubt that Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel made \\"Un Chien Andalou\\" in hopes that it would be a big box office smash; they were more interested in expanding the artistic potential of film, and if they challenged and confounded the viewer in the process, so much the better. And throughout the history of filmmaking there have been a great many other directors that have pushed the envelope of the medium in their own ways, whether through storytelling or visual imagery.<br /><br />With INLAND EMPIRE, I think David Lynch has gone back to his roots, forsaking the interference of big studio executives and marketing his film on his terms. As everyone knows by know, he is notoriously reticent to discuss the film's \\"meaning.\\" But if all he really wanted to do was blur the distinction between fantasy and reality, and in the process make his viewers become just a little unhinged ... well, I think he succeeded in spades. Few films that I can think of have crept into my mind so tenaciously. And when some reviewers dismiss INLAND EMPIRE as pretentious nonsense, all I can think of is the old curmudgeon who looks at a Jackson Pollock painting and sneers, \\"My four-year-old granddaughter could do better than that!\\"aking the interference of big studio executives and marketing his film on his terms. As everyone knows by know, he is notoriously reticent to discuss the film's \\"meaning.\\" But if all he really wanted to do was blur the distinction between fantasy and reality, and in the process make his viewers become just a little unhinged ... well, I think he succeeded in spades.

B000QXDEDG|4.0|As the title for this review suggests, this movie is high on hype. However that makes it far from being a poor cinematic piece. The Spartans have been fabled as some of the best strategic and well trained soldiers in all of Greek history.    To bottom-line it, this really brings you into their way of life. They live to die essentially, you will see how brutal Spartans are and how even against enormous odds their life-training is really what helps them fight against a massive force of Persians.    Anyways should you get this movie?    - If you like to watch dramatized historic events captured on screen. Then Yes.  - If you don't like mild to moderate gore. Then no.  - If you're expecting something that will just blow you away with superb acting, deep characters and a thick and juicy plot. Look else-where.    In short, this is a very energetic revival of the fabled Spartans with a lot of help from 21st century technology.
B000G73UEU|3.0|It is difficult to separate the CD from the DVD, as the DVD was simply horrific to watch - too many artists utterly dependent upon the words, destroying their own performances and messing up what should have been a brilliant project.  Sadly, the one track that is so tremendously good on the DVD and so obviously missing on the CD is Rufus Wainwright's rendition of Hallelujah.  This could easily have replaced the out-of-place and all together uninspiring Tower of Song by U2.  Teddy Thompson's version of Tonight Will Be Fine is spinetingling and possibly worth the purchase alone.  Anthony and Rufus Wainwright are equally good.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Before you touchy Brit's go hitting off on the \\"not helpful\\" button. The World At War is the BEST!!!! OK???? Ok now that I have said that, I am not going to reminisce about every episode, I watched the whole series in pieces on PBS during the 70's and 80's and later, and now on DVD (it's wonderful).  However, one must admit that it is heavily biased in the UK's view, and it's abhorrent that in a 30th anniversary edition, that there are no CLOSED CAPTIONS!!!!!! I think you Brit's take it too personal dislike that others cannot understand you but you must remember, there are many Americans, Germans, Poles, French, Asians, and many more speaking in English. Is that not enough to offer in a 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, plain old closed captioning??????? How about this one, are there no deaf people who live in the UK?????? Give me a break A&E. I can only understand about 75% of the narrative in this series (including our esteemed narrator!), I also am no back woods hick from America, I have traveled the world and have to focus to understand a lot of the narrative, it makes for good repeat viewing I guess but c'mon, other Americans may get less than half, honestly. If you want to call me lazy so be it but I want to be entertained and whats more important, I want to have my children draw an interest, I wonder if they will fully (?), not really understanding what is being said with the thick Cockney accents?  OK its still great, I guess for the price you cant beat it since it's much lower now than 5 years ago, and I absolutely was riveted seeing Karl Doenitz (who I understood better than many of the Brits interviewed! Still the CC would have been nice.) interviewed; that footage along with all the other aides and Generals and Admirals and Minister's was priceless! The last of the BBC's glory days to me.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|So the big Smashing Pumpkins reunion wasn't the big bang many expected. Some people criticized this immensely and I am one of the people included in that group. But anything that has Billy Corgan doing something other than Zwan or another solo album is a good thing. I say this because Siamese dreams to me is the epitome of what the pumpkins could be at their best. I want to focus on that specific album though because not many people know that most of the instrumentation in that album was performed by Corgan alone, obviously drumming was work of Jimmy Chamberlain. So that means that this effort should work, and it does, it does so very well but apart from putting it ahead of Machina, I think the album comes short in regards to most other pumpkins' material in general. That's not to say this album is bad. It really isn't and quite the contrary, it's quite good. But Billy Corgan has seemed a bit lazy with his voice ever since Mellon Collie and what he could do with it, he doesn't. Instrumentation wise, look for heavier tracks like United States, Doomsday Clock, Tarantula and some other solid tracks that showcase why Jimmy Chamberlain is such a great rock drummer. As for the quasi concept within the album, this is no Year Zero, but it's not a bad fairing either. Giving it 3 and a half or even 4 stars is totally acceptable but I limited it to 3 since the massive comeback we were sold wasn't in this album. Instead we got a solid cd with some great tracks, some filler and the hopes that The Smashing Pumpkins stay \\"united\\" to see what will happen next.
0205313426|5.0|This itsy bitsy tome is an ageless classic. I read it for the first time 20 years ago. Despite having never found grammar interesting before, I became hooked on the sharp little lessons. I read it again, to both delight and edification. And I'll read it once more, to remind myself of the rules that make English what it is and to smile at Prof. Strunk, long gone but very much alive in these pugnacious 80 pages. He's somehow managed to boil down the bones of the language and give you the absolute essentials. If you haven't read it, you're in for a treat and a pleasant surprise, especially if you don't care for grammar. This is truly short and sweet.
1563890119|5.0|The Sandman series is largely responsible for rekindling my desire to write. It is a beautiful work of art both visually and regarding its unique plot. This series won Neil Gaiman numerous awards and critical acclaim and it is well deserved. It's a delight to pick up these graphic novels and just see how dreams and reality are interwoven to dizzying heights with surprise twists, unique endings, plot branching and zero commitment from Gaiman to cater to typical comic lovers. I'm not saying the world of Marvel has nothing to offer, but I am saying that if you're an adult and want something intellectually stimulating and challenging that dares you to dream and invites you to respect the eternal energies that govern the unconscious, the parallel and the trans dimensional. Five stars shouldn't be given lightly as neither should one star ratings. But when something comes along that shatters your preconceived notions of certain aspects of your reality, then I think this easily counts as one of those instances where I'd put a six star rating if it were allowed. Simply put, mesmerizing and marvelous.
B000P2A24W|1.0|Back in 1984 I discovered a little single called &#34;Runaway&#34; by some unknown American band called &#34;Bon Jovi&#34;. Here in Australia I believe it was actually the second single but I liked it enough to grab the debut album. I was blown away and have been a huge fan ever since, even getting backstage on the &#34;These Days&#34; tour. Since &#34;Blaze of Glory&#34; however there have been warning signs over Jon's use of acoustic guitars and the influence of country music (&#34;Saturday Night&#34; for example), but Richie,Dave and Tico have been able to keep things in check long enough to continue producing great music even if we have to occasionally listen to garbage like &#34;Bitter Wine&#34;, &#34;Diamond Ring&#34; or most of the &#34;This Left Feels Right&#34; album. With this album however Jon has gone too far. Given that &#34;Bounce&#34; and &#34;Have a Nice Day&#34; were both brilliant rock albums and equal to or superior to &#34;Faith&#34;,&#34;Jersey&#34; or &#34;Slippery&#34;, to come up with an album of mostly crap like this is beyond disappointing. Dave and Tico have no input at all and while Dave's personal problems led to some of the best stuff Jon's ever written on &#34;HAND&#34; Richie's baggage sees our two heroes wallowing in creative mud. If our duo wanted to experiment (or cash in on the unexpected success of &#34;Who Says&#34;) they should have done it as a Jon Bon Jovi/Richie Sambora side project and not as a band project. Outside of the excellent &#34;On Any Other Day&#34;, the title track  and &#34;Memory&#34; the rest is forgettable and the lyrics on &#34;We Got it Going On&#34; are the stuff a 15 year old comes up with while he's still trying to learn how to write. I wasn't going to buy this album, did anyway then wished I hadn't. You can do much better boys. Let's hope next time you do.
0800141660|5.0|I love Jane Austen, I love well-done 19th Century Brit Lit classic productions. The actors are fun...Emma Thompson, as always, is superb and Hugh Grant, of course, is the bad boy one just loves to hate. This movie is really multi-purpose: a great way to spend some time if you are home with the sniffles, a great escape on what might be the end of an all too modern day, or just cozy to watch curled up by the fire.     Definitely worth owning...sort of a \\"little black dress\\" DVD. ENJOY!

0451450523|5.0|while I have not read this amazing work of fiction, i have seen the movie! and let me say....WOW!   this compelling drama is about a young unicorn coming to terms about her magic pals, who in the words of the eccentric butterfly (has anybody here seen Kelly?? Red rover red rover send Charlie on over!!) \\"passed down the old roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close behind him and covered their footprints.\\" This journey takes us through the mind of a troubled young mythic beast who goes through a wide range of emotions including love, curiosity, loss and ......REGRET!!!! After crossing paths with a befuddled young magician, Schmendrick, she starts her journey to recover the lost unicorns and solve the mystery of the Red Bull! Now I don't want to give away the ending, so you just go buy that book/movie and read/watch it!!!  I'm serious. I was genuinely touched by this book/movie and hope that it will change your life as it has changed mine.   Thank you for your time.   P.S. Now that I'M A WOMAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN!!   and I'm a UNIIICORRRNNN!!!   (man is she confused).
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I'm very excited to own the original Star Wars series on DVD.  I'm a huge fan of the series, but I'm also a purist who prefers the un-tweaked versions of episodes IV, V, and VI.  So I am tickled that Lucas finally released them on DVD, and I'm excited to own them at last.

1400063515|3.0|The \\"black swan\\" is something I've intuitively understood for a while living on internet time. 5-year plan? Who knows what will happen in 5 years, show me what you are doing right now. Beyond internet, I've noticed the spread of unpredictability into my friend's lives, with everyone moving, scheming, doing something completely different every few years.<br /><br />So, I was looking forward to reading this book. It took persistence to finish it. Every time he'd go off on a tangent, talking about Lebanon, how people are wrong, wrong, wrong, and his own very thoughtful life, I found myself skipping. If this stuff hold your attention, you'll have no problem getting through it. He bragged about lack of an editor, and I found myself thinking \\"Your book is exactly why we need them\\". Personally, he bored me most of the time. Where was the good stuff, the deep look at emergence of black swans in the modern society? Never got to it. NYTimes review had it right.<br /><br />3 stars for ambitious subject, and making me weary of the Gaussian.
B00006JDVV|4.0|1. Matthew McConaughey; 2. Christian Bale; 3. Originality; and 4. The Production Aspects - special effects, light, direction, sets, et. al.<br /><br />Two of the stars I gave are for McConaughey's performance.  He takes the character of Van Zan and breathes life, and yes fire, into him, without crossing into pardody or cliche.  The movie's title could refer to Van Zan, as easily as it refers to the dragons' destruction of human civilization.  Christian Bale gives a fine performance as Quinn, steely resolve tempered with overwhelming concern for the welfare of those he leads.  The two characters make an interesting pair.  Van Zan is all about killing the dragons.  Quinn is all about protecting the few remaining humans in the area.  When Quinn and Van Zan are at loggerheads, they inadvertantly tear apart the resolve of the remaining humans in the area. When Van Zan and Quinn act together, the dragons truly have something to fear.<br /><br />There are lots of movies with, and/or, about dragons.  The take on dragons in this movie isn't new - dragons during modern times - but the strength of the characters, writing, and sets put this movie into the realm of \\"well done\\" (something about the movie's title has my pun gland working overtime).  The movie avoids a lot of in depth explanations about the dragons origins.  I think this is a wise decision.  The viewer, like the characters, are torn from the every day normality of modern life, into a world where dragons are real.  Go with the flow, and enjoy the movie.  The sets are amazingly well done - pun intended.  The remnants of modern human civilization left after the firestorm of the dragons are vividly portrayed.  The dragons are magnificent - simultaneously majestic and loathesome; as well as immortal and vulnerable.  Kudo to all who worked on the movie's special effects.<br /><br />I didn't give the movie five stars because there are some faults.  With the exception of the character Creedy (who single-handedly keeps the movie from being 100% grim), the supporting characters, while necessary, are not well introduced.  My impression is that some of the supporting characters, especially Alex and Jared, while essential, had a lot of their scenes end up on the \\"cutting room floor\\".  This left a disjointed feel to Alex and Jared's screen time.  I also think that the flow of the movie was interrupted too often with scenes of vehicles traveling on roads.  During such scenes I kept thinking, \\"I get it, I get it!  Grim world.  Grimy world.  Tough world.  Technically, a nice shot.  Now, get back to the movie!\\"  The traveling vehicle scenes went on just a little too long, losing the momentum of the action.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this movie for a great viewing experience.im), the supporting characters, while necessary, are not well introduced.

B0000640VO|2.0|If this was a US movie it would have been lost among the other chick flicks but because its French we are supposed to act like its above the rest. I thought they tried too hard to make Amelie likable so it ended up making her really annoying. The love story was totally Hollywood style pipe dream take on love but based on two freaks finding each other, both of whom I couldn't care less about.    On the other hand, the supporting characters were interesting and provided some funny scenes so I'm giving it two stars for that. But otherwise this was rubbish.
0451174291|3.0|This book is a confused woman's rights saga.<br />Personally, it is somewhat repulsive in<br />it's Victorian and anachronistic point of view.<br />It most reminds me of Jane Austin in it's treatment<br />of social situations and romance.<br />I don't think it is a good idea to encourage<br />either this or August Strindberg's attitudes toward women.<br />We need a better approach.

1591841666|3.0|Much of Godin's advice makes sense, although it's not especially original. Know when you're going to quit and have an exit strategy. Don't get stuck in a cul-de-sac: a dead end.<br /><br />Those who focus on a market or skill do reap greater rewards than those who generalize. Among scholars, picking a tiny slice and expanding will reap big rewards. Remove distractions from your life.<br /><br />Godin's power curves are very convincing. There is a huge difference between Number 1 and Number 2 when you look at ice cream flavors and box office sales. But sometimes a decision to rank lower can be strategic. Some gurus advise against aiming to be Number 1 or 2 on a search engine, because you'll get more tire-kicking clicks.<br /><br />Much of Godin's advice makes sense for individual as well as corporate career planning. Most careers have dips. Many people find themselves in cul de sacs.  What he calls \\"the cliff\\" resembles a comfort zone: \\"The longer you do it, the harder to quit.\\" As a career consultant, I think the cliff is far more common than Godin suggests.<br /><br />Two problems with this book:<br />(1) In real life, it's often hard to distinguish between a cul de sac and a dip and careers often morph from one to the other without warning.<br /><br />In fact, the book's examples inadvertently demonstrate this ambiguity. On page 38, Godin suggests that the helpful mailroom clerk might rise to CEO. On page 62, Doug gets branded because he's been with the company too long: everyone remembers when he started.<br /><br />We should note that Jeffrey Pfeffer's book, What Were They Thinking, actually contradicts Godin's tips on pages 38-39: Pfeffer suggests that CEO wannabes *not* suck it up but instead stand out. He argues that the behaviors needed to climb to the top are not those needed to succeed once you've arrived, specifically adding that climbers tend to be disliked by their peers along the way.<br /><br />(2) I almost stopped reading when I read about Hannah, the law student who became a Supreme Court justice presumably because she worked hard and stayed focused. On page 8, Godin writes that any of 42,000 law graduates could have become Supreme Court justices. Hannah worked hard and made sacrifices to reach this goal.<br /><br />This statement is simply not accurate. A simple Internet search would have revealed the fact that nearly all Supreme Court clerks tend to come from the top 5 or 6 law schools. As recently as 1998, journalists reported that few women and even fewer minorities were chosen. I suspect age makes a difference as well.<br /><br />(3) This book is a pithy prescription, deliberately simple so as not to obscure the message. But are we better off when those who want to succeed have to jump through artificial hoops? Do the hoops really encourage the best and the brightest? For example, many experts suggest that education courses discourage many potential teachers, who turn to other fields.<br /><br />Finally, there really is no happily ever after.

0399226907|5.0|My 11 month old will sit and \\"read\\" this book for minutes at a time (that's a long time for toddlers)! She loves the different sized pages and tries to stick her fingers through the holes. Eric Carle is a brilliant author/illustrator. You're safe buying ANY of his books.
0684803356|2.0|The Spanish Civil War was surely the most brutal and tragic civil war of the twentieth century. It not only pitted Spaniard against Spaniard, but became a kind of bloody curtain-raiser for World War II, with Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy lining up on the side of Franco's insurgents and the USSR backing the embattled left-leaning Republic. (The Western democracies - who might have prevented Spain from going fascist - followed a pusillanimous \\"hands off\\" policy which only emboldened the insurgents and their supporters.) Into this vortex came many writers and intellectuals. They were to witness brutality, betrayals, great valour, the corruption of ideals, and the consequences of ruthless Realpolitik.    So with all that in mind, here's an interesting question. If you were an author trying to write the great Spanish Civil War novel, would you choose to (1) sequester your handful of characters up in the mountains away from the main action; (2) write 500 pages covering a mere three days during which time nobody has anything to do; and (3) make the central character non-Spanish?    500 pages about three days of waiting is the book's central problem. It turns the novel into the opposite of an epic. To have taken a canvas as sweeping as the three years of the Spanish Civil War and shrink it down to such a compass-point was an unfathomable decision on the author's part. From this self-inflicted literary ambush there is no escape for Hemingway: you either need excellent descriptive prose or superb psychological insight to carve a good story from such crooked timber, for, after all, what else is left to describe in such a situation save inner musings and the outer landscape?     The prose is the next problem. Much has been made of Hemingway's 'deceptively simple' writing style. However, I found it impossible to read \\"For Whom the Bells Tolls\\" without forming the impression that that his reputation for putatively well-masked complexity is itself the deception. Consider thefollowing extracts [from the Vintage edition]:    A hole in a hillside is described as:    \\"both deep and profound\\"  [p. 444]    Characters exchange such dialogue as:    'Well, then. Oh, then. Oh, then. Oh.'  [p. 166]      'Maria.'  'Yes.'  'Maria.'  'Yes.'  'Maria.'  'Oh, yes. Please.'  [p. 272]    'But use thy head. Thou hast much head. Use it.'  [p. 444]    Which brings us to the Hemingway penchant for meaningless repetition:    \\"In an impossible situation you hang on until night to get away. You try to last out until night to get back in. You are all right, maybe, if you can stick it out until dark and then get back in.\\"  [p.  174]    \\"So a woman like that Pilar practically pushed this girl into your sleeping bag and what happens? Yes, what happens? What happens? You tell me what happens, please. That is just what happens. That is exactly what happens.\\"  [p.  175]    Followed by some impressive run-on rants as the author becomes completely carried away describing love scenes (How many women - even in the thirties - were seduced by being repeatedly called 'rabbit'?)    My favourite passage is when one of the characters reveals to Joaquín that la Pasionara has a son in Russia. Instead of naming the character, Hemingway chooses to write the following clanking line:  \\"'If we insult them a little?' the man who had spoken to Joaquín about la Pasionara's son in Russia asked.\\"  [p. 324]      On and on it goes like this. For three days. In a cave. This book has now gone into the umpteenth printing and neither the spelling nor grammar have been corrected (\\"... the flakes was dropping diagonally ...\\" [p. 185]; \\"... and then brining it down ...\\" [p. 213]; \\"... the felling when the Inglés gave the order ...\\" [p. 380]; at one point André Marty is referred to as \\"Mary\\" [p. 437]).    So it needs to be said openly. Hemingway pundits who make excuses for this sort of thing have a lot of explaining to do: otherwise they are obliged to defend similarly poor writing when they find it outside the world of Nobel laureates.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|This is colourful but lightweight satire on the inanity of the fashion industry and male models in particular. Unfortunatley the makers apparently regard the film's audience as itself lacking critical faculties and intelligence, so the satire is obvious and inane rather like, um.... the notional male model.
0316067598|5.0|You will probably make it through Navy boot camp. You probably won't be selected for SEAL training. You have a very remote chance of finishing that. Then the fun begins. Unless political correctness kills you. This book covers all of the above through the eyes of the man who survived it. It is rough, tough, hard to put down. It is probably the best book you will read in a long time. There is no excuse to miss it.
0307383415|4.0|Due to its multi-section arrangement, falling into three precise stages, this book feels like a well-paced coming-of-age novel, an impression buoyed by the fact that, to a degree that is unusual for politicians, Obama can actually write well. If you are looking for information on what policies Obama would support as a presidential candidate, you should look elsewhere. However, the book does give the impression that the writer is unusually forthright, both about himself and his beliefs.<br /><br />Watching Obama's attitudes on race evolve is one of the key points of interest in the book, and the reader comes away with a picture of a man who is both reflective and self-critical. It is somewhat apparent that the author was not running for office at the time the book was written, and yes, it (very briefly) mentions his now infamous flirtation with cocaine use. However, if you want to read a portrait of the man, if not his political platform, and interested in the struggles of someone growing up in between two different cultures, this book is well worth reading.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|The HD-DVD is packed with features I actually wanted to view - most times I never get to the \\"Bonus Material\\". In this respect the HD-DVD version is much better than the BluRay equivalent. In picture quality, the two formats are bit-for-bit equivalent and I can't pick any discernible difference in the audio. I haven't tried the \\"DVD\\" version on the other side of the disk - I view this as a particularly useless feature.<br /><br />The film itself is excellent and deserves the big screen treatment. This is a hi-def DVD that showcases the technology. Highly recommended.
B000001FI7|4.0|First, this is a phenomenal album, it creates an amazing atmosphere that feels both new and familiar.  However, I gotta say that I prefer the live album PNYC(the dvd is even better.)  Aside from the wonder of seeing the band and orchestra deliver an amazingly on-point performance, the interplay between the musicians (as opposed to the loops on the album) makes the songs really come alive.  Anyway, Dummy is a great album nonetheless, and if you are coming at Portishead from an electronic, hip-hop or dance angle, then you will probably prefer this to PNYC.  But if you're more into jazz, rock or classical than I advise to check out PNYC first.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I loved this movie!  SO thought provoking and such insight into 1980's East Germany.  As everybody has said...great acting/strong story.  I cannot say much more than saying this is an unforgettable movie that is so entertaining and tense at times!
6305428557|5.0|I love Hugh Grant and the English sense of humor which is why I purchased this DVD.  I was not disappointed.  While it is not quite what I expected on the romantic comedy end it is well worth watching and ranks up there with \\"Waking Ned Divine\\" in terms of the comedy and how it all plays out. A great movie I'd recommend to anyone who is a Hugh Grant and/or English film fan.  Totally enjoyable.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is the beginning of their journey into musical places no one else had been before. Can you imagine the first time Norwegian Wood was heard (what is that sound, a sitar?)? So many songs of creativity, reaching levels of beauty and talent never reached by a rock and roll band until this album. Great lyrics, a sophistication of sounds and songs far beyond \\"Hard Day's Night and \\"Love Me Do\\". Still only 22-25 years old, they made a collection of songs that still blows people away over 40 years later. A essential part of any rock or pop collection. I brought up my daughters (21 and 23 years old)  on the Beatles, and they love this CD. 20 or 65, people of all ages and cultures recognize the quality of this recording. George Martin (the engineer of their music) is the best in the business, too.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|From totally original albums like The Freedom Suite to the more standard and lyrical The Bridge, Sonny has always convinced me that he is as good as the best. Even with high expectations Saxophone Colossus just blew me away. Definitely one of the greatest jazz albums ever.
0061153923|5.0|I listened to the audio CD of the book Stardust after I had seen the movie and I found both to be delightfully charming in their own ways. The fact that Neil Gaiman was the narrator made it even more entertaining because he is such a talented reader. The CD includes a little surprise at the end with an interview with Neil Gaiman. I highly recommend the CD as light, funny entertainment; I listened to the CD while commuting to work and both the narrator and the story kept me laughing, snickering, chortling, and giggling to the amazement of passing drivers.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It's far from being just another nature show.  It's THE nature show.     Too bad the DVD version isn't narrated by Sigourney Weaver like the TV version.    A MUST!  Fast delivery, nice package.
0321344758|5.0|I am new to web page design.  Krug's book is succinct and humorous.  He holds to his goal of being readable in a long plane trip!
B000GG4KTU|4.0|I would not rate this album as my favorite. Diana Krall Live in Paris is still at the top of my list, while this album, in my opinion, is not a must have.
1594489505|5.0|I loved Khaled Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner,\\" and I knew I would enjoy \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\" However, I had no idea how amazing this book was, and it is now one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" covers several decades of turmoil in Afghanistan. The story focuses on two women whose lives are intertwined as a result of their tragic circumstances. Mariam, the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman, is rejected by her father after her mother commits suicide. Instead of being welcomed into her father's home, 15-year-old Mariam is forced to marry Rasheed, a man 30 years her senior who becomes increasingly violent over the years when his new bride is unable to produce a child. Years later, Rasheed takes in 14-year-old Laila, whose parents died from rocket fire during wartime and whose true love, Tariq, is presumed dead. Secretly pregnant with Tariq's baby, Laila agrees to become Rasheed's second wife rather than face almost certain death by trying to make her own way in the world. Trapped in a hopeless situation with their evil husband, Mariam and Laila eventually realize that they have led very parallel lives, and come to rely on each other for support and survival.<br /><br />Hosseini has succeeded in writing a novel that depicts the horrors of a war-torn country and the realities of what it meant to be a woman in the days of Taliban rule. More than that, though, this book features two amazingly strong female characters who demonstrate bravery and resilience at every turn. It's an incredibly moving and emotional story, one that should be read by everyone.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|There are many who don't like to read or who don't have the time. So this Dvd is great for those who are on a spiritual path with one foot still stuck in the rat race.  This dvd gives excellent examples of synchronicity, and a wonderful visual example of energy fields and how we can amplify our energy with others. It is good for parents who are introducing their children to the world of spirituality.
0066620996|4.0|an excellent book with great examples of successful corporate behavior.  a must read for any entrepreneur or corporate manager.
006123205X|5.0|Great advice for understanding how to relate to women.  Give no advise.  Just listen and be compasionate....
034544678X|5.0|Reading other peoples' reviews, I noticed that a common complaint is that this book talks too much about primates. Hey, humans are primates too! It's important to understand our own behaviors - why we do the things we do - just as it is important to understand our dogs' behaviors. This book made me hyper-aware of how I was acting around my dogs, how my good intentions were being misunderstood, and what we CAN do to communicate effectively with our four-legged friends.     This is not exactly a how-to reference manual, but McConnell does give some great suggestions for dealing with certain behaviors which I have used on my own dogs. I found this book to be engaging from cover to cover and recommend it to anyone who has a dog, is thinking about getting a dog, or knows someone who has a dog. In fact, I wish everyone who will come into contact with my dogs could read this book first :)
0385520298|5.0|I ordered this book after seeing a review in an Australian women's site. It is just shipping in the US now. I'm also amazed that there are only two (male) reviewers!    It's a great book. Funny, sad, touching. A very Chinese take on romance.    I personally also love novels that play with language such as Clockwork Orange and Riddley Walker. To me, this novel is in that category.
0671646788|4.0|This is an all time classic.  But if you buy this book you better not be looking for a contemporary book on cutting edge material.  This is a classic like \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\", with solid moral and ethical principles of business and how to live your life.      I would say that this is a must read, except for the fact that you have to get past some pretty dated anecdotes and the fact that the writer does not reference who these anecdotes are about. I can't imagine a contemporary writer getting away with what was polite and respectful writing in 1959 & 1965 when Schwartz uses anonymous examples to make his point.  If a writer does that today they would seem to be writing fiction.    I may have offended some and I apologize.  This is a great book and I don't mean to take away from the very sound principles in it.  My only warning is that it was originally written in 1959 and that doesn't make it any less than excellent.
B00005JLXE|4.0|This was a pretty good comic adaption.  I was very satisfied with the story line.  Ben Affleck did a good job playing Matt Murdock.  Duncan was also a good pick for the Kingpin.  Only part I didn't like was the Character Bullseye.  Ferrel was a good choice of an actor to play him, but they made his character to dumb and nothing like the comic book character.  The Bullseye branded on his forehead looked retarded. Besides that and Daredevil's super healing factor, the movie was pretty awesome.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|I think the previous reviews did a great job of explaining and describing this album. It is so well worth listening. I grew up with Mano Negra, but this is a whole new level.
B00004XPPE|5.0|This film is truly a masterpiece of suspense with an all-too-real twist. Very much in line with the issues and fears of the 1950s and 1960s, but still a gripping story today. Henry Fonda's performance is incredible. The plot moves along very quickly but is not overly complex. The cinematography is beautiful and dramatic. Sidney Lumet's commentary is also very good and insightful. I agree with other reviewers that this film is in need of restoration due to very coarse grain, dirt on the print, etc. which could probably be solved with some combination of optical and digital techniques.
B000RJO58M|5.0|I'll keep it brief:<br /><br />This HD-DVD has a fantastic picture. Very, very pristine looking. The sound is really loud and will beat your surround speakers and subwoofer up something awful. Seriously. it rivals the most ridiculous sounding action movie you've seen. A simple scene like a purchase of an ice cream cone sounds almost like a multiple car crash. And the whole movie is like that. But I'm not complaining!<br /><br />And there's more extras here than you'll be able to watch in one sitting. One of the extras is the second flip book drawing that Nick Frost's character shows off to Simon Pegg that we don't get to see in the film. Just that in itself is worth the price of admission!<br /><br />Seriously though, this is (and I'm almost surprised to say it) an HD-DVD more than up to the task of being a demo for your home theater system.
B00005MM67|5.0|This came on television late one night. It has what few movies do - a great story. Everything supported the plot, which is dynamite. Parts are perfectly cast. Acting is transparent. Well-drawn characters. Jaw-dropping conflict. Everyone I know who has seen it reacts the same way - astonished that it isn't more well-known.
6305546789|2.0|\\"What??? He gave this classic masterpiece 2 stars?!?\\"<br /><br />Is that whats racing through your so called brain?<br /><br />This film has been heralded as great horror, but its nearly as stupid, boring, and insulting to one's intelligence as some of todays worse slasher movies.<br /><br />This original version of the movie, unlike the Excorcist, does not stand the test of time.<br /><br />And why is that? Well, i hear time and time again, that this movie is a such a great essential classic. Being essential and classic doesnt apparently mean its truly great, becouse the acting is very bad in this movie. The script is dumb and the characters arent interesting or likeable.<br /><br />Its not as annoying and insulting as something like Halloween:Ressurection. ( a zero star movie) but its certainly NOT the great film its touted to be.<br /><br />And we hear \\"CLASSIC MASTERPIECE\\" over and over again in the same sentence as the title. But i honestly feel the people caling it that are just stuck on the fact that its suppost to be this \\"great classic\\" and dont or refuse to see it for what it is...a B-movie.<br /><br />Maybe it got popular becouse of the fact that in the late 70s, a movie with a killer in a mask like that, killing kids and people with a butcher knife was kind of a fresh idea. But as a movie, you cant deny how poor it is.<br /><br />It might be a classic old horror movie that sparked lots of trends, but this is NOT deserving of the word \\" MASTERPIECE \\". Thats a complete lie.<br />But people and critics keep saying it and saying it, but their words dont have meaning becouse it doesnt match up with the movie.<br /><br />The genre of \\"HORROR/SLASHER\\" movies hasnt been the most respected or acclaimed genres out there, to say the least. And i suppose within the relm of the endless sea of stupid gore fest slasher films, this must be the Father of them all and so its reveared as such a 'great' thing. But if you see it as a film, its not very good, and you dont even have to be some purist film critic snob. Anyone can see that fact.<br /><br /> The music, the resounding piano theme is memorable and is classic.<br />The legend that has become Michael Myers through out the years has grown beyond the depiction found in the original film. Michael Myers is not very impressive at all in this movie. He sounds allmost like an ape, how he breathes through the mask. And he just seems like he is mentally handicapped more than he is psychotic.<br /><br /> And the 'teenagers' in this movie all look like they are allmost 30, like they should be outta college or something. Not convincing AT ALL as highschool kids.<br /><br />But all that is just side complaints. The movie itself is just boring, and i had to force myself almost to watch it in its entirity and give it a proper chance before i made final judgment of it.<br /><br /> The image of Michael Myers and his theme music is what is truly legendary and haunting to this day....Not this film.<br /><br />Despite the 'popular critics' view, the recently re-telling of the film,<br />directed by Rob Zombie, titled \\"HALLOWEEN\\". is far more superior film,<br />that brings actual weight and respect to that legendary killer...MICHAEL MYERS.<br /><br /> Out of respect for John Carpenter and his original film, watch this original movie made in 1978.<br /><br />But FIRST, if you have a choice for which to see first, id say<br />see the Rob Zombie re-telling of \\"HALLOWEEN\\", first, that is a deep, emotional, and truly horrific piece of work, that captures the sheer intensity of what became the legend of Michael Myers that rises above and beyond the original, while stil giving it much respect. Rob Zombie delivers something awesome that truly and finally lives up to such a haunting legend...something neither the orginal or ANY of the sequals have EVER done, nor could do.<br /><br />Im no fancy critic, but im giving this 2 and half stars...the half is for its originality at the time, with its theme and character.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|Manu Chao's mixture of influences has long been marked him down as world music but this album is likely to be changing the face of the mainstream.  He's come a long way from Mano Nagra who started off by emulating the cross cultural experiments of English groups like The Clash and The Specials who loved to add Reggae and Ska to punk spirit.  He's added other influences like Latin and African and an element of classic French and Spanish song writing.  He's also learned to use simple lyrics backed with the feel of music to provide social commentary.  The real development on this album is the re-introduction of electric guitars, played by sidekick Majid, which add to Manu's rustique strumming style.  It's all been in the melting pot a long while and now he has a 'Mestizo' style all of his own that has already influenced many French and Spanish acts like Amparanoia, Fermin Muguruza and Sergent Garcia.  It's not surprising as he's obviously a sincere guy who lives for music. Possibly acts in the Englsih speaking world will be looking up to him soon, this album could really cause a stir in the USA and the UK.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Most ppl seem to only review the films when it comes HD/Blu-ray but you can find those anywhere, its what it looks/sounds like in HD that is important.    300 looks amazing on Blu-ray everything is gorgeous, the cinematography really comes alive in HD. The bristles of the spartan helemts, the sun gleaming off their shields. Watch the scene where the greeks are captured in the storm and you'll swear you are there on the cliff with Leonidas. All i can say is vivid.    I don't yet have an amp capable of True HD sound but i've read elsewhere that the LPCM mix is actually better on this version. Listening to LCPM it is incredible. Listen to this loud and you will be awestruck. The musical score sets everything up, sweeping across the room setting the tone. Turn that bass up for when the Persians march towards the spartans your room will shake, you will hear every taunt from the spartans towards the persians and the grind of the sand as they halt the persians at pass. The mix is excellent, you will hear everything from individual voices, to arrows, swords clashing to men screaming. This movie is loud.    Forgive the poor qaulity in trying to describe what this film looks/sounds like in HD. Pick this up, not only is 300 a great movie but it deserves to be seen and watched in HD. You deserve to watch it too.
B000P2A256|4.0|Ok, well, I guess I am stupid for thinking that Maroon 5 would keep with the same sort of genre, music style, as their first CD.  Mainly, at first it was just shock after hearing this CD, it is very different than the first. However, giving it a couple months time and more than a few listens, I have decided that I DO like the CD, more than I originally thought.<br /><br />You have to hand it to them- keeping their songs fresh and possibly finding a way to reach new fans with their music.  Some of my favorites on the album are: Makes Me Wonder (duh), Wake Up Call, Not Falling Apart; which are examples of their new \\"style\\". And the following that are \\"original M5 sound\\": Won't go Home Without You, Nothing Lasts Forever & Goodnight Goodnight.  So, happily, there is a bit of both sounds on this CD- pop and also softer pop.<br /><br />I would recommend to M5 to give this CD a chance, but do be warned that more than half of the CD is very different that what you might expect, but it might be happily so.......

I have been slow catching on to Josh Groban's music but plan to add several CD's after hearing this one.  There is one word that describes this young mans vocals, WOW.  I am so glad he knew the gift God gave him and is sharing it.    You can't lose with this CD!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I was nervous about getting this cd until I heard someone playing it so I took a chance. The very first song stayed in my head for weeks. This cd is a must buy if you like Sade and or a Jill Scott fan.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I guess I disagree with all of the people who wrote bad reviews. Yes, some parts of the movie are not quite realistic. It's a movie!! Movie does not equal reality. I think it provides a good look into the underworld that exists in many middle class American high schools. So if you grew up sheltered from the drug world in your high school it may be difficult to relate. However if you grew up in a high school with drug prevalence it will really resonate with you.     The movie deals heavily with drugs and their presence in American high schools. I felt that I could really relate to the movie. A guy in my high school got a bullet in the head when he didn't come up the money from a brick of coke that was fronted to him. Another guy got a gunshot wound to the leg when he knew too much about something with the message that the next one would be in his head. Four guys beat a guy to death for his wallet. I'm sorry if the movie and the plot seems unrealistic to some, perhaps if you hadn't led such a sheltered life it would seem more real to you.     The fact that the characters seem a bit too intelligent is again a product of perception. My high school group of friend's was very Dawson's Creek, our conversations seemed to be beyond our years. The main character brilliantly brings down everyone who was involved in his ex-girlfriend's death. The best revenge I've ever seen in a movie.
B00063F8B2|4.0|Alan Silvestri creates a great score, however the extra Christmas songs did not need to be included.
B000QQFKYE|4.0|Even seeing some of his other movies, and hearing about this beforehand didn't prepare me for the craziness that was in store after popping this DVD in.  I'd have to say I enjoyed the first hour the most, as it was the most linear and easiest to follow.  And then the movie suddenly gets really bizarre and somewhat incomprehensible.  I really wasn't sure how I was supposed to decipher what I was viewing, was this actually the curse being played out?  Was it some kind of metaphoric dream interlaced with random scenes of the past, present, and future?  Lol after watching it there's plenty of discussions online if you want to try and screw your head on straight afterwards.  I enjoyed the movie, but don't wish to spend another 3 hours with it in order to watch with an experienced perspective.  I don't mind that he made this movie, but hope his next one returns to his previous style with a less surreal narration.  I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Zodiac is one these movies that from the very beginning one presents its enormous artistic ambition. Zealously narrated, with a visible documentary style and photographed in sepia and autumnal colors as obsessive frame that reaffirm and accent the puzzled, intriguing and mysterious set of events since 1966 of a compulsive but very smart murderer, who acted according patterns based on solar cycles, that literally commoved and made a true scandal, because of the effrontery and unexpected logic around their next victims.<br /><br />A hunter caricaturist - Robert Graysmith - and a scrupulous journalist - Paul Avery- decide by themselves to intend reconstruct step by step each one of the crimes, and investigate by themselves with an ethereal support of the assigned investigators for this entangled and complex puzzle.<br /><br />Leaving aside all the efforts displayed by this ceaseless caricaturist trying by all his means to find out any striking evidence that be considered as relevant and irrefutable to discover the identity of this vanishing and disturbed-mind assassin, the movie makes us to reflect around the multiple bureaucratic  barriers between the different counties in which the different massacres were made, as well as the smart legal strategies that froze and so many untied clues, that joined with such perverse and astute criminal mind, made of this sounded case a real unsolved enigma during 38 years.<br /><br />David Fincher once more astonished us through his zealous camera handle, the fabulous edition process in order to present us during more than 150 minutes, the most significant details of such case.<br />c entire cast and evidently the employment of the music as allusive reference to emphasize certain insights into the drama, the outdoor stages were carefully made, taking into account with admirable accuracy designs of dress and reconstruction of cars of those ages.<br /><br />Slow-paced film that demands from you your entire attention.
0060594896|5.0|This is one of the most informative books on self help that I have ever read. I have taken Jack's advice and decided to read the book all the way through and then return to the beginning and take notes and complete the exercises. With over 400 pages of how to get from where you are to where you want to be, I imagine I will reread the book many times and also later in the future. The exercises I am going to spend a lot of time on and will return with another review once I put the steps in action.
B000GFRDN6|4.0|..the cd portion of this package is tough.  It sounds even better remastered.<br /><br />..the dvd portion is one of those that gives a brilliant insight into the bluesman that is Steve Miller.  It begins with an interview by Mr. Joel Selvin, that explores the dichotomy of Steve Miller: the downhome personality versus the arena savvy musician.  I found it very informative, despite myself not being a \\"solid\\" Steve Miller fan.<br /><br />..it continues with a stellar performance by Mr.Miller at the Shoreline Amphitheater (Mountain View, CA).  Along with an \\"all-star\\" ensemble, Mr. Miller rocks (and rolls) thru such hits as \\"Swingtown\\", \\"The Joker\\", and an extended version of the title track, \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\".<br /><br />I really enjoyed this, and, honestly, it made me wish I had a time machine, so that i could go back, and not only enjoy the 2005 performance at Shoreline, but go further back and enjoy the Don Kirshner \\"Rock Show\\" outtakes that were briefly shown during Selvin's interview.  The only thing that i wished had been included (in the 2005 performance) was the song \\"Living in the U.S.A.\\", which happens to be one of my all-time Steve Miller Band faves .  But, whatever, this still proved to be an impressive show.<br /><br />..finally, this dvd concludes with a 5.1 surround sound transfer of the \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" cd, in its entirety.<br /><br />Let it take you higher, as the \\"space/wind\\" ambience of this recording collection sounds even more transitive and atmospheric, than in previous versions.
B000NA1OXY|2.0|When I first heard her album \\"Under My Skin\\" I was in love with her new sound and was so glad she sounded like she was finally growing up. That album is her best and probably always will be. Ok, so, now about \\"The Best Damn Thing\\"......Well. When I first heard \\"Girlfriend\\" I was pretty disappointed. It's okay if you're in a goofy or excited kind of mood (OR if you're under the age of 16). So I thought maybe she just made a bad choice when deciding her first single..I bought the album anyway. Wow, what a waste of money. Her mature, deep rock sound is completely GONE!! This album is VEERY Blink-182/Sum 41-ish...very \\"punkish\\" and childish. I gave it 2 stars because there are a few songs..I think I kinda like maybe 3 or 4. But even those aren't worth bragging about. Don't think I'm saying this because i'm an Avril hater, i know there's a lot of those. I like avril..usually. I just am really disappointed with the sound and direction of her new album. She chants like a little 16 year old cheerleader and spits off snobby lame comments about hating boys. WWWWAAAIT, didn't she just get married like a year ago? You would think that would have made her LIKE them or made her MATURE..but it definitely didn't. Yes, she's happy now and everything (which is great) but she doesn't have to be \\"childish\\"...with lines like \\"I hate when a guy doesn't get the tab, I have to pull my money out and that looks bad\\" she's not going to get anywhere, except with pre-teens. My advice to Avril is to mature the music a little...she's 21 right? same age as I am. She sounds about 8 years younger. If you liked \\"under my skin\\" and most of her first album, this album is probably not for u. If you like \\"EVERYTHING AVRIL\\" go for it. but even you will probably be disappointed. The people with the reviews \\"Avril is the best, this album ROCKS\\"...they have to be like 14. There's no way anyone over 18 would say that, unless u dont know what real rock is. So the moral of this story is..I'm waiting for the next passing steam roller...
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother, and we listened to it together this summer while driving in the car. It was an excellent CD, filled with gorgeous harmonies and Celtic themes. My only regret is that I didn't buy the DVD as well.
0807126063|4.0|This book is always recommended for those who liked \\"Handling Sin,\\" a book I read about 15 years ago and continue to reread with great enjoyment.  I've just finished my first reading of Mr. Toole's book and can see only three similarities:    1.  Both books take place in the South  2.  Both are full of kooky characters  3.  The writing style is very lyrically similar.    This was an entertaining book but a short one, taking about 3.5 hours to read.  I do recommend it but it probably won't be a reread for me; none of the characters engaged my sympathy except Jones, and it's not worth rereading for Jones' part.    I do recommend \\"Handling Sin\\" very highly if you haven't read it.  It's a much longer read - maybe 5-6 hours or more if you speed through it - and more intricate, IMHO.
0143038419|5.0|This is one of the best self-exploration books I have ever read.  What a gift to have a writer make herself completely vulnerable.  It allows the rest of us to see that putting it all out there is a good thing.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know and I am awaiting the next book.<br />I was completely baffled by the poor reviews of this one as her subject matter is clearly her journey.  Anyone's self journey is going to focus on them and not the political, social and whatever other issues may be going on as well.  Don't miss the point of what she is offering - it is an authentic and well-written account of her personal path that we can all learn from and be inspired by.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Is this a real \\"reunion?\\" Did Billy do it for the money? Does this album deserve to be titled with the name \\"Smashing Pumpkins?\\" Everyone has their own opinionated answers to these questions, but honestly, who cares! What's important here is the music. That's what Zeitgeist is--an album of music. And the music here is awesome. If you like SP's more rocking numbers, you're going to love Zeitgeist, their heaviest album to date. With Zeitgeist Corgan leaves behind his \\"rock is dead\\" mentality, picks up his detuned axe, and rocks our socks off.     This is definitely a rock album. Though that's not to say a bit of creative diverging room hasn't been carved out for the album. \\"United States\\" clocks in at a noisy 9:53, \\"Neverlost\\" is carried mainly by its Xylophone melody, and \\"For God and Country\\" has the most obscene bass-heavy mix I've ever heard in a rock song. Lots of good music here, from beginning to end. Forget the industry politics, and listen to Zeitgeist for what it is: a killer rock record.     Great lyrics, melodies, and riffs--all come together to make Zeitgeist one of the best releases (if not the best release) of the year.
B000NVT0RU|4.0|This film follows a small group of colonial soldiers from different parts of the old French empire as they make their way through occupied Europe during WWII. It moves quickly from 1943 to 1945 and includes an impressive full-scale battle scene, moments of personal grief and happiness, and an impressive and saddening conclusion. Always present is the tension between the colonial soldiers and the nation whom they are serving.    You'll notice some similarity with Private Ryan, but it's a very different film. It's saying: \\"You made our country part of your empire and, because we resented your presence and tried to do something about it, you killed our families and said it was in the name of peace. When the Germans invaded, your resistance collapsed in 6 weeks. We heard the call and came to fight and die for you; but you wouldn't treat us as equals. You promised us a place in the history of the liberation, but you pushed us aside and gave the victors' laurels to Frenchmen. Then, when it was all over, when those of us who left our homeland and families, who lost friends and saw the terrors of war at first hand needed your help, you paid us a derisory pension which you then froze.\\"      The French behaved towards their colonial fighters no worse than the Brits did towards the Gurkhas. Shame on them both.     The battle scene at the end it first-rate - a realistic piece, not some over-blown load of bollocks. It's a sad end to a good film.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|So I deffinately like the CD after hearing it a few times, but it did take a few times. My first reaction wasn't so good because it didn't sound like anything from Kelly's last CD so I guess I was a little off guard by the different music styles. They weren't bad, just not what I expect from her. I would say that her last CD was better, but this one isn't bad once you give it a try and forget about the songs from her last CD.
B00030590I|5.0|HERO is a cinematic Martia Arts masterpiece comparable to \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"House of Flying Daggers.\\"  With great actors such as Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Zhang Ziyi, Tony Leung, and Maggie Cheung how can this movie not miss!    The plot takes place 2000 years ago, with 7 warring states in the Chinese region.  The ruler of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) wants to conquer his fellow states, and unite China.  Assassins are after him, and thus he shields himself in the palace to keep all but his most loyal followers away from him.    A prefect from Qin is summoned to the King, as he has killed 3 assassins who have been attempting to take the King's life for some years!  Nameless (Jet Li) comes to the King, and then relates his story on how he killed each of the 3 assassins.    The first battle is between Nameless and Sky (played by Donnie Yen).  For those waiting for the sequel battle to \\"Once Upon a Time in China II\\", you will not be disappointed.  The scene is intense: as they battle in a rainy courtyard, with a music player providing background music.  So intense in fact, that eventually the battle is fought within their minds!   Next, Nameless tells the King he travels to a small calligraphy school to encounter the assassins Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung) who are currently lovers at odds.  There is a beautiful scene where the King's army lays assault to the school with arrows, as the students and teacher perform calligraphy.  Eventually, Nameless challenges them to a duel, but they cannot decide who goes.  Flying Snow stabs Sword, but then has to first fight Moon, (Zhang Ziyi), who is Sword's apprentice.  When Snow kills Moon, she goes to battle Nameless, who defeats and kills her!  Following all of this?  When Nameless finishes his story, the King does not believe him.  And thus enfolds, the rest of the story from the King's viewpoint, and then what really happened!  I was impressed by the depth of the characters and story, that eventually leads to the sad climax, and the true meaning of \\"Our Land\\" !    The movie is visually stunning!  The background, the remote locations, the costumes, and the use of colors are awesome.  The director uses coloring to influence the characters and the scenes!  From the brightness of the yellow leaves, to the blue lake, to the green sheets in the palace, all the coloring is an explosion on your eyesight.    There are some extras on the DVD:  * Hero Defined: is basically an overview on what Director Zhang Yimou thought of the movie as he began production of the script, and how he wanted to make a \\"Swordsman\\" movie and what it takes to make a \\"Hero\\".  I am still amazed that this was his first action film!  Impressive!  Also, for the lake scene, it took them 20 days to film the scene, as they could only shoot from 10am to 12Noon, because of the calmness of the lake at that particular period.  * Storyboards  * Conversation with Quentin Tarantino and Jet Li:  An informational talk about martial arts films, and Jet Li's various performances in them.  * Soundtrack Spot      If you love action and martial arts films, you will love \\"Hero\\".  Jet Li is awesome, as are the rest of the cast.  The movie is visually stunning, and the martial arts and swordplay are intense and exciting!  A definite must add for any DVD collection !
B00079FUI6|5.0|This set includes all of season 1. If you have never seen the show and want to get into it I suggest this product because it is fun to watch and laugh along with, and it will give you the basis for all the other seasons and who all the characters are.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|I'm not going to address the Weinsteins' decision to release Grindhouse in two installments. Sure, I'm disappointed that the fake trailers are not going to be included. But what really gets me is how meandering and poorly paced Death Proof is. Gone is the memorable, quirky dialog of Tarantino's earlier films. Gone is the ratcheting tention of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Gone is the style and intensity of Kill Bill.<br /><br />What remains is incredibly long and unrewarding dialog scenes, a choice soundtrack, and B-movie production values mixed jarringly with expertly put-together tracking shots and cinematographic framing. While the climactic car chase is exciting, the actual end of the film kind of leaves the viewer holding the bag. And the protagonists are not only uninteresting, but several of them are downright unlikeable.<br /><br />I think Rose McGowan, Kurt Russel, and Rosario Dawson manage to rise above the material -- I could watch them read phone books. But the rest of them are pretty replaceable, and Nicky Katt is completely wasted in a near-cameo role as a convenience store clerk. Check out \\"The Limey\\" sometime, and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />I guess it's a common mistake for people to defer to an artist's \\"vision\\" when he's previously worked some cinematic voodoo. They don't tell him that his dialog is meandering and pointless, that his characters are uninteresting, or that there's no real story going on. He must know what he's doing, because he's Quentin Tarantino, right? We should just stand back and let him work his magic. It'll all come together in the end, right? Well, it didn't. Rent it if you like, but I wouldn't rush out to buy the DVD.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|I wish I could write a review of \\"Stranger Than Fiction.\\" I really do. But I can't. You see, after going back and forth to my local video rental store THREE times and renting THREE different copies of this film, I was shocked and disappointed to discover that NONE will play in my dvd player. My dvd machine is less than 6 months old AND PLAYS EVERYTHING -- JUST NOT THIS MOVIE! What's going on? After doing a Google search, I've noticed countless people posting the same message: THE DVD WON'T PLAY ON THEIR MACHINES! Sony has, supposedly, come out with a new copy-protection program and decided in its infinite corporate wisdom to incorporate it in this movie. It interferes with the dvd's playing capability in MOST dvd players. I WILL NEVER AGAIN RENT A SONY DVD. AND JUST BECAUSE OF THE INCONVENIENCE INVOLVED HERE, I WILL NEVER AGAIN PURCHASE A SONY/BMG CD. The corporate bigwigs are sticking it to the working class once more! Well, they lost my business forever. I'll survive, but will Sony???
1891252089|5.0|I've been doing Ashtanga for 2 years and am really enjoying David's manual.  It explains each posture in detail, it has the sanscrit translation, and many variations in postrues for those of us that are not quite up to David's skill level (that's most of us).    I would hightly recommend this book and I would also recommend taking a class from David if you have the opportunity - he is serious about his practice but very light hearted and funny in the lesson.    He very assertively recommended that we do not push ourselves too much just to be 'good yogis', which has helped me become less of a perfectionist and has enabled me to relax, enjoy, and breathe.    Namaste.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|My wife and I watched this series when it was aired on TV and fell in love with it.  After purchasing a PS3 with Blu-ray capabilities, we knew that this was to be our 1st purchase to show off it's capabilities.  Wow is it beautiful.  The episode about the deep oceans is incredible.  If you've not seen this series yet, and you enjoy documentaries, you have to get this series.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|From the brilliant mind of Joss, the creator of Buffy and Angel, comes un interesting mix of Sci-Fi with a Western theme.  At first glance I'd never have watched this show, but after the first episode or two I was hooked.  I'm guessing that the western twist probable kept many would be fans from even giving it a try, but I assure you, this show is a blast.  I really hope that it is not too late for the networks to get a clue and pick the series back up.
B000OP1M6M|4.0|was a good price on amazon $ 140, bought it here rather than on the bay for the box. the box is cheap plastic and not like the other boxes watches are supposed to come in.      it has a tough automatic movement, hardex crystal, detailed case back, decent band. the lume is very bight and is a lot easier on the eyes at night than other watches. has a rotating bezel with the red and blue \\"Pepsi\\" styled scheme. date with english/spanish day at 3. smooth rotating at 6 beats a sec, second hand. 40hr reserve    but...  i will never buy another watch on amazon. bought 2 watches both had problems. first was used with minor scratches and no official back seal tape which is a blue circle. this watch had problems with reserve power it was only giving me around 4-5 hours when it should go for 40 after a full days use. got it fixed myself, amazon had no other watches to send me a replacement with.    if you are thinking about buying this watch on amazon dont, get it on the bay. the only watch you should ever buy on amazon is the invicta 200m professional automatic diver in black priced at under 100.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|Certainly not her best work. I was surprised this was the music style she had longed to do and was warned against. For those who want more rock it probably would be a good choice. I just don't see Kelly in chains & tattoos. She can sing anything well, and I understand her desire to change things up to break away from the hometown girl image. She can change, but must keep the solid pop coming or risk losing those fans who voted for her and the great style music we picked her for.
0375831002|5.0|We read this for our book club. It is one of the most heartwarming stories that I have ever read. I highly recommend this book for all ages, especially for those who take interest in the Holocaust. You get the events from a total different perspective.   I'm not going to give away the plot, but if you pass up on reading this book because it looks too long, or boring (which it is not!) etc. etc. you are missing reading a great book.  It brings laughter, even some tears. My book club and I were egging the characters on while we read.   This book is a great piece of literature, read it! It is the best book ever!
0738702994|5.0|I have been searching for years for the \\"right\\" tarot deck - wanting to find just the right set before I made one my own.  As soon as a friend showed me this deck, I knew it was The One.  The art is simply beautiful, and I love the fact that the deck is centered around Welsh mythology.  The book is clear and well-written, and having the reverse readings available is great for those of us who use that method.  Definitely a lovely deck!
B000PMGS8G|4.0|I remember watching this movie when I was 8 years old on HBO and to me it is still one of the coolest films ever made. Flash Gordon had very colorful special effects that made it stand out.Though they were not  of the Star Wars quality they did make the picture viual. Ulike the Ming in the new Flash Gordon this Ming is the true Ming.With the attitude, the costume, and the head gear and berd that is what Ming is all about it think.And finally the women are more exotic in this version such as Aura and Dale which were so hot that they lid up the picture.I  reconmend this film for those who have never heard of Flash or are wanting to see it for the first time.
B00000255O|5.0|Geez.  It's 2007, and this album STILL rocks heavy weight.  These tracks burn just as bright as when they were realeased; the solo's, the arrangements, the grooves, the songs, everything is slammin'.  This is definately a \\"Desert\\" album.
B000002OX5|5.0|Having read through a lot of reviews/comments about this album, I find the accepted view is, that it is a great album, comparable to their best and that this 'version' comes with some good, but not necessarily essential, bonus material.   Oh, and there are even some people who don't like it!     Well I actually count myself lucky that I only got this album recently, because it means my view of it wasn't skewed by familiarity with its much shorter former incarnation. I actually played it as is, unaware that the additional tracks had not been part of the original release.     My impression was one astonishment. Why was this album not widely trumpeted as one of the greatest works of the sixties? Why was \\"Tommy\\" considered a better album? I was mystified. A double album(as it must have been judging by its length)of this quality would surely be included in all those 'Best Album...' lists.   The truly amazing thing is the way that, although it is not a 'concept album' the music fits together to create an incredible barrage of striking imagery that all coalesces perfectly to create a 'whole' that really is greater than the sum of its parts. One of the strengths of the album is the lack(!) of well known tracks(the only one I knew beforehand was 'I Can See For Miles') this gives the record a lovely 'balanced feel'.     I find it very strange, now that I am aware of the original track listing, to think that the album was ever released without 'Early Morning Cold Taxi', the stunning instrumental showcase 'Hall of the Mountain King' and perhaps the gem of the whole album 'Girl's Eyes'(a perfect and sympathetic depiction of the fixated fan/band relationship).     It isn't the easiest \\"Who\\" album to like(it took me a few plays before it started to 'click'), and in this form there is so much more to digest than before, but I would suggest it has the potential to be the most rewarding long term listen of all their albums.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is a classic recording. One of the best Beatles recordings. Is it the greatest? I am not sure. I have all the original 13 CD's and some of the other stuff. If I was to choose three recordings of the fab four, I would take Rubber Soul, The White Album and well here is the problem.

B000P0J024|4.0|George was the catalyst for this all star group. If you did not buy the original discs, consider this one. I do not think the videos are that great. I did not buy it for the DVD. Add this to your collection because we are all heading to the light.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|Come Taste the Band was the last studio record Purple did in the 70's. And it is a great example of how a million people (and maybe a few more...) CAN be wrong... all those fans who ignored it because it didn't feature Ritchie Blackmore don't know what they're missing. You, my friends, on the other hand, if you are reading this, is because you're interested, and I can promise you that if you keep reading and ultimately decide to purchase this record, that interest will be duly rewarded!<br /><br />In 1975, shortly after completing an european tour in support of \\"Stormbringer\\", founding member, guitarist and resident tyrant (don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of his music, but the guy has serious issues...) Ritchie Blackmore left the band. An established act like Purple has 2 choices in such a situation: call it a day, or soldier on with a replacement. Purple chose the latter, and faced with that, they had 2 ways to go too: either choose an imitator and try to recapture the original sound and glory of the band, or forge ahead in a new direction. Again, they chose the latter, bravely enough. Rumor has it they originally set their sights on Jeff Beck, but unable to get him, went with a rather \\"risky\\" choice: a young yank named Tommy Bolin, with more of a background in Jazz/blues/funk/fusion than (hard) rock.<br /><br />What did they come up with? Instead of telling you first what you're gonna find here, i'm gonna tell you what you are NOT gonna find here: you're not gonna find \\"Highway Star\\", or \\"Space Trucking\\", or \\"Burn\\" or even \\"Stormbringer\\" for that matter. Meaning that those songs driven by a big, nasty guitar riff are gone. That's not a bad thing, it just IS. With the departure of Blackmore, the remaining members were given ample space to unfold their talents, and they certainly show it here: Paice never drummed better, Lord is there filling in for Ritchie with his ever immortal Hammond B3, Hughes is in fine shape both as a bassist and singer, Coverdale sings his lungs off and Bolin, while not sounding like Ritchie Blackmore (he didn't even try, which was a bold decision...) makes a strong impresion throughout.<br /><br />The band was, at least at the moment of the writing and recording of this album, rejuvenated and reinvigorated, and it really shows. My only observation would be about the vocals: how come there are only a few tandem vocals here? Coverdale sings the lion's share while Hughes sings two solo numbers (\\"Getting Tighter\\" and \\"This Time Around\\"), but the only song where they truly sing together is \\"You Keep on Moving\\". The tandem vocals are one of the features that originally fascinated me about Mk III, so I was hoping to get some more of those here. Still, their individual performances are consistently top-notch.<br /><br />Try to imagine a cross between \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" and \\"Might Just Take your Life\\" and you are halfway there! Most of the songs are rather carried through by the monster grooves that the band creates: \\"Coming Home\\", \\"Lady Luck\\", \\"Getting Tighter\\" and \\"I need love\\" (the latter being one of my favorites) are the best examples of this. Then you have a few songs that are a little more guitar driven, but here again they are different: instead of big classical scales (a trademark of Blackmore), the guitar riffs have a bluesier, \\"Hendrix-ier\\" feel to them, like the case of \\"Dealer\\", \\"Drifter\\" and \\"Love Child\\" (which is a bit reminiscent of Zeppelin's \\"Heartbreaker\\"). And then you have 2 succesive HUGE songs to top it all: \\"This time around/owed to G\\" , which is a two part song, the latter being an awesome instrumental that takes us back to those jams the band became famous for, and \\"You Keep on Moving\\", a song that can remind you a bit to \\"Child in Time\\" by its atmosphere, with the harmonies of Coverdale and Hughes being a high point. This album is awesome!!!<br /><br />So what was the problem, then? Was it too funky? Nope, actually Stormbringer is way funkier than this. Was it too soft? Nope,the record rocks big time. Was it \\"less good\\" than previous records? Most definitely not! The reason is very simple: any band that experiences that many lineup changes is bound to lose (at least some of...) its identity, whether they realise it or not. And that's what happened here. Add to that the substance abuse issues that both Bolin and Hughes had, that would end up causing the implosion of the band and the death of Bolin shortly thereafter, and you realise that it just wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />The bottom line: if you liked Stormbringer, you will LOVE this record! So if you don't have Stormbringer, i would recommend you to get that first. If your favorites are albums such as Burn and Machine Head, this may be a little odd for you. But i honestly recommend you to get it either way. If you like good, groovy rock, you should love this one too! Great music is great music, and you should give it a try! And the timing for you all to get this CD couldn't be better, either: thanks to this Friday Music release, you won't have to shell out any extra money to get the import version(s). I'm a diehard, and this is without a doubt one of my favorites. Go ahead and give this band a taste...the record rocks big time. Was it \\"less good\\" than previous records? Most definitely not!

B000002UA2|4.0|This album preceded Dark Side of the Moon, and I think has more shades of what was to come than the other early albums (Meddle, Saucerful, More...), although Meddle shows bits too.<br /><br />One of my favorites ever since the 70's.

This movie is glorious fun. Definitely not for the squeamish, however.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|First of all, it doesn't say anywhere on this release that it's a Special Edition. Second, if you know anything about the history of this film, you'd know about all of the rights issues that have made it extremely difficult to re-release the film, let alone release extra material. Why does a release always have to have a bunch of semi-interesting extra stuff anyway? I would be more concerned with the quality of the restoration of the film that I would watch many times as opposed to a bunch of extra garbage that you'll watch only once in your life.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers at their upbeat best. Can lift the suicidal out of their depressions.
B00005JPLW|1.0|This film would be laughable if it were not trying to take itself so seriously.  Easily one of the most pretencious and grossly inaccurate film on any historical event ever conceived!  From the costumes of the Spartans down to the Middle Earth looking army of the Persians this is total and complete fantasy.<br /><br />As a comic book for teens and adults that have never grown out of that genre I suppose it may have some value, but to regard this as any kind of serious history is truly mistaken.  Most people seem to be impressed by all the PC graphics used for this distorted epic.  Is this how we judge the quality of films now?  By their high-tech gimmicks?  Where is a decent storyline, some attention to the actual events, etc.  If this is where we are going with quasi-historical epics I certainly won't be going to the movies much anymore.<br /><br />If the reader is seeking a film that pays some attention to the actual events I recommend the 1962 \\"300 Spartans\\".  While a classic sword and sandal flick, at least it does not have Xerses as some over-blown drag-queen!  The Persians look as they should, and you don't have all these mutants and ugly wretches floating aronnd onscreen.  Why is this kind of thing approved of now?  Again, this is for kids, and adults who read comics (graphic novels, but just a fancy word for the same.) If you like  over the top entertainment without any thought process then this is the film for you.  All others beware of the excessive gore and mindless violence.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|When you are looking for music with great musicans, you really have to dig deep into Indie, Jazz, and Death Metal (and some but very few NU metal)because todays pop scene is mostly a bunch of no talent bands and singers that will be on the 99cent rack quicker then you can blink an eye. Most that call Death Metal \\"Noise\\" just dont get it. People didnt understand Morrison or Hendrix either, and today they are legends that redefined Rock. \\"Cryptopsy\\" is the Mozart of Death Metal. I have never heard anything like them in the genre. Sure there are tons of talented Death Bands, but Cryptopsy is on another planet. What they do seems un-human. When I first purchased this album, I just kind of listened in awe. I cant imagine seeing them in concert. Are we supposed to head band and mosh, or sit back on lawn chairs with our feet on the floor and with a program in our hands. It almost seems that way. This is really an amazing effort, and I still havent even absorbed the entire album yet. Flo could be the best drummer in the world. Not only is he amazing with Cryptopsy, he is trained with a jazz background which you can clearly hear on his solos. Check out his website to see some of this. I hope every fan of Death pick this up. Even jazz fans might appricate it, they might not like Lord Worms Vocal, but I am sure they will appricate the drumming and the guitar breaks which are so jazz and classical inspired, it is beyond belief. Give it a try. You will be in shock the first time you hear it.

B000PKG7TI|4.0|I am a fan of this excellent band. Music is great in both performance and quality of audio.   Compared to the previous DVD \\"From Wishes to Eternity\\" in this one they did a better job in synchronizing audio to video, now it looks like Tarja is really singing.  However, I give the worst rating to the video editing because on fast songs they change the camera angle/image every 2 seconds which becomes very annoying. They tried to do something fun or creative but maybe they were on drugs or just had too much caffeine. The fast change in images gets your eyes tired so you might as well turn off the TV and just listen to the audio.
B000MQ54OO|1.0|I wanted to share this with my daughter when she got home and we were greatly disappointed to find the DVD HD side was completely defective. Our HD player refused to read it saying it was blank (other HD products have played just fine). The regular side played fine.     Since we were past the 30 days return time (my daughter was away from home for the summer), Amazon refused to replace the defective disc - turning a fun movie choice into a dissatisfaction with Amazon as a whole.    I recommend the movie but be leery of defective burns.
B000068IEU|4.0|Last House on the Left is exploitative.  That's one way to put it.  It's a bit informative, definitely shocking, and definitely one that needs to be watched.    The movie itself takes a backseat to the content in a couple of its scenes.  It's hard to give an accurate review of this movie while still withholding much of what makes this movie a must see.    It's definitely shocking and definitely exploitative to a certian degree, but what really makes this movie is the questions you're left with at the end.  It's an intelligent (if that's even the right choice of wording) 70's exploitation flick.  The exploitation isn't there to arouse, it's there to cringe, disgust, and move to viewers to an uncomfortable feeling.  Most people don't consider this movie to be a masterpiece, or even a good movie.  While no masterpiece, the acting is wooden at times, the direction is a little lagging, and the comedy is forced, this is one of the better movies of the wildly entertaining cinema heaven known as trhe 70's.    Last House on the Left packs a whollop that no movies today, not [[ASIN:B00009W0U4 Irreversible]] or [[ASIN:B00005U12T Baise-Moi]] can ever grasp.  And one that [[ASIN:B0002CHIJW I Spit On Your Grave (Millennium Edition)]] can't certainly get.  It's different.  It's thought provoking.  It's shocking and downright terror inducing, but it's viseral yet intellectual, and dangerously effective.  An exploitation with a conscience.    Now, the DVD features a commentary with Wes Craven and Sean Cunnigham.  It also includes a 30 minute \\"Making Of\\" feauturette's that nearly as must see as the movie itself, and a number of never-before-seen scenes.    Definitely recommeded.
0060887966|5.0|The Alchemist is an amazing book for anyone \\"searching for answers\\". It really reinforces the notion that it's all about the journey - not the destination. Well written and far more complex than the simple writing style might lead you to believe. This edition was a gift for a friend - it's beautiful to look at, as well.
6305922756|5.0|This is a great movie.  Not only is it a great mockumentary, but also a great movie too.  It's perfect.  It strikes perfectly with everything it's parodying.    I heard a lot of music artists were upset because they didn't see the humor in oit.  To me, that makes it even funnier, it's as a good as real life.    The DVD is somewhat of an upgrade from the earlier Criterion edition.  It includes a new commentary with McKean, Guest, and Shearer in character, a new interview with director Rob Reiner, over an hour of delted scenes/never-before=seen footage, 4 music videos, and plenty of other extras to love.    This is a definitely recommended DVD.
0307387178|5.0|If you're anything like me, you can't get enough of Jon Krakauer, and his absorbing study of the strange and ultimately fatal adventure of Christopher Johnson McCandless as he walked alone into the vast Alaskan wilderness, \\"Into the Wild,\\" scores another bull's-eye.    Initially assigned by the editor of \\"Outside\\" magazine to report on the unusual circumstances of the young man's death, Krakauer was captivated and puzzled by the tragedy.  He produced a nine-thousand-word article, which ran in the January 1993 issue of the magazine, but he was haunted by the boy's starvation, and, recognizing \\"unsettling parallels\\" between events in McCandless' life and his own, he spent a year unraveling the mystery of the young man's death.    The book takes us to the northern margin of the Alaska Range and a remote track called the Stampede Trail.  This is where hikers came upon the frozen corpse of Chris McCandless, dead for two and a half weeks after a solitary survival adventure of four months duration in the frozen wilderness, living on berries, small game, and a moose he managed to shoot.    Krakauer traces the boy's life, his fascination with Jack London's writings, and his insurmountable urge to meet life at its harshest, on his own with the barest minimum of survival gear.  Krakauer recounts similar exploits by other adventurers and his own youthful attempt to climb the Devil's Thumb on Alaska's Stikine Ice Cap, but the reader is never far from that lonely bus in the frozen north where Chris McCandless spent the last four months of his young life.  The story is gripping, disturbing, and ultimately baffling, which in some measure explains Krakauer's fascination with the brief life and death of Christopher McCandless.

This movie is so incredible.  It's moody, heartfelt, and tragic.  One of the best movies of all time.    The DVD doesn't have much in the way of extras but the movie itself is one to definitely have.    This is a Must Have.

Pete Townshend's guitar is just cranked and he's rocking like crazy, John Entwhistle's bass work is so cool on this thing, he's chunking out chords and playing all these great lines, Keith Moon is drumming the way only Keith Moon drums, and Roger Daltrey is singing just fine.<br /><br />Its loud, its rockin' its the Who before they got to pretentious and bombastic.<br /><br />You gotta love it.
0743517849|5.0|I was very impressed with the book on CD. Hearing the book kept the words running through my mind. The principles outlined in the book underscore the importance of budgeting, living within your means, and investing for the future. It also distinguished between affluent living (foreign luxury cars, country club memberships, expensive homes, etc.) and a wealth building lifestyle. Must reading for those serious about attaining financial independence and responsible financial management.

B000Q6GXW2|5.0|I went to see this expecting the wild and cartoonish scenes you saw in Sin City - expecting -and- hoping in fact. But what I saw instead was such a vastly improved upon style. Yes some flavors were there, but so much more mature and broad and - at least expensive looking- effects. Sin City was done on an amazing budget with un-paralled styles of film making in many years, but awesome and grusome too. This lives up to and exceeds my expectations many fold. Obviously lots of digital effects, but wow what a story!!! True to life \\"He** no\\", but the message conveyed had flavors of style from Gladiator to Sparticus. I loved it in the theatre and will watch dozens of times again.  Take a look at the Wikipedia definition of 300 and read the story before you see the movie or even to reflect on what you saw. Very cool story of bravery - that part was definitely true to form.
0060763892|5.0|James Rollins is getting better with every novel he writes.  Unlike other popular novelists with a series, he hasn't fallen into formula or stock characters.  He reaches and stretches in every novel, both in plot and idea and character development.<br /><br />The Judas Strain doesn't disappoint.  Rollins has endearing characters that you really care about, a very interesting premise, and non-stop action.<br /><br />He moved up to hardcover with Black Order, and is now on my \\"pre-order\\" list.  To see an author get better and better with every novel is a real treat.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|The James Bond series always seemed to me to have a bit more potential than it delivered.  The world's best secret agent going up against an array of colorful, dastardly evil-doers in exciting locations all over the world, beautiful women abounding as both allies and enemies, creative deathtraps, stunt-filled adventure on a massive scale...  But, although I haven't seen all the previous Bond movies (and maybe the only problem is that I've missed the really good ones and seen mostly the 'lesser' entries) it seems to me that there's always been one problem or another getting in the way.  A couple of the chapters where they attempted to make it more humorous, they missed the mark and ended up getting campy.  During a number of the movies, the Bond character himself seemed way too cold and arrogant, less the hero that I figured a 007-type character should be, than a guy who mows down whoever his government tells him to and doesn't really have feelings one way or the other about it.       In \\"Casino Royale\\", ironically, it's not by launching Bond as a more heroic figure but by making him - at the start - colder, meaner and more emotionless than ever, that sets the film off on becoming the best of the series (based on the ten or so I've seen) and among the greatest action/espionage movies ever.  This prequel/remake, starting before James Bond even makes it to Britain's elite 007-status, depicts him in its early stages as a killer without conscience or emotional connections, lethally efficient and ice cold.  As it moves along \\"Casino Royale\\" neither ignores this seemingly non-heroic status or goes into a detailed backstory, but drops a few hints as to the origins of Bond's persona and what it is that really drives him, under the surface.  The plot of the show has Bond and the UK's intelligence service trailing a group of arms dealers who supply numerous dictators and terrorists worldwide, eventually leading to the world's premiere gambling event.  There, the central mastermind of the arms cartel is trying a last-ditch effort to gather the funds to cover a slew of deals gone bad because of Bond's interference, before his clients, disgruntled over not receiving their merchandise, come looking for him.      The relationship that develops between Bond and the female government agent, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), assigned to him, is totally atypical of the usual agent/girl pair-ups in the Bond series, and it's the story between Bond and Lynd as much as the spy thriller story that makes \\"Casino Royale\\".  It's done totally convincingly; so are the other aspects of the movie.  The action and stuntwork are fantastic and believable, and I doubt any other movie has ever devoted so much time to a black-tie poker tournament and managed to make it so riveting and entertaining.  Bond is a more nuts-and-bolts fighter here, tending to just beat the living daylights out of the bad guys with his fists instead of using remote-controlled cars with rocket launchers under the hoods.  Daniel Craig brings the character to life with a career-making performance.    \\"Casino Royale\\" starts James Bond off seeming to be little more than a cold assassin, develops the character, bringing out hidden aspects of him, and changing him into a more likable figure, then crashes him down to rock bottom psychologically before the final act.  It really remains to be seen which side of the fence he'll have ultimately landed on for future movies, but I hope they continue progressing Bond, and any other returning players, in the future movies rather than just letting \\"Casino Royale\\" be a stand-alone.  I also hope they'll return as many performers in their Casino roles (such as Judi Dench as M) as possible rather than doing a lot of recasting.  I think the future of the movies could see much more of a focus on a recurring or semi-recurring ensemble, with James Bond still at the center of course.  The best era for the 007 series may have only begun.
B000000W5L|4.0|My original review (and three-star rating) read as follows: &#34; The production is muddy, and most of the songs are forgettable. The entire album sounds like it was recorded in one afternoon, in a basement with very bad acoustics. The flat production was considered somewhat ballsy at the time: in an era when more and more albums were becoming &#34;artistic&#34; productions taking months or years, Exile on Main Street and its sort of...well...BAD sound was considered to be a deliberate rebellion against this. Or was it just bad sound? Hmmmm....&#34;<br /><br />That review was based on an earlier release.  I eventually was talked into buying the 2010 remaster, and to me, there IS  a world of difference.  The remastering has caused the instruments to be more individually audible, although the sound is still muddy compared to other Stones' albums.<br /><br />I still say the album is over-rated, but I've added a fourth star to my rating.  Since some of the muddy production was corrected (at least in my ears) with the 2010 remaster, the album is more listenable and accessible.  It's not an album to recommend to casual Stones fans or as an introduction to the group.  It IS an album that needs time to work its spell, and is best listened to from start to finish rather than trying to sample individual songs.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, if  your experience with the Rolling Stones has been through their fantastic career of singles hits as on the Hot Rocks CD's, then you may be put off by this.<br /><br />If you approach it as an overall work, i.e., not to be cut up into individual songs, then you may like it.  With repeated listenings it comes across as a kind of gritty roots-rock concept album:  as if it was deliberately made to sound like some guys banging out tunes in some grungy brick building in the Deep South or something.  It's best judged as an overall presentation, and not as a collection of songs.  Just like it's hard to look at Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon as anything but an overall, seamless, work, so it's best to view Exile on Main Street the same way.  Although I doubt seriously the Rolling Stones consciously conceived this as a &#34;concept album&#34;, it's kind of a happy accident that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  If no individual song stands out as being a hit on the level of some of the Stones' biggest hits, the overall album gives the impression that it does indeed deserve to be called a classic.<br /><br />Just don't make this your first introduction to the Rolling Stones.work, so it's best to view Exile on Main Street the same way.

1400034205|3.0|I came to this novel looking forward to reading about the spiritual journeying of its main character, Larry Darrell.  Although Larry does occupy a central role, that role is far from being the starring one.  Various other characters populate the pages, each taking nearly as much space as Larry.  Perhaps Maugham intended the others to act as a foil for Larry--to contrast their materialistic pursuits against Larry's spiritual ones.  But I never cared for the others (most of whom Maugham portrays as being quite shallow), and for me they became distractions.  In many scenes, the highlight would be some words from Larry. But then Larry would sit quietly in the corner and listen to the inane chatter of the others.  I diligently kept reading only because Maugham would throw out a crumb or two about Larry.<br /><br />But the story of Larry's spiritual quest comes front and center in Chapter Six, the penultimate.  Here we are treated to a long, revealing account of Larry's experience in India.  This is the heart of the book and by far the most interesting.  Strangely, in opening the chapter, Maugham warns the reader that he \\"very well skip this chapter without losing the thread of such story as I have to tell.\\"  But my own warning is this: read Chapter Six and nothing else!  And this chapter can be read without any knowledge of the earlier chapters.<br /><br />Earlier, I read a commentary comparing Razor's Edge with Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha, and there are similarities.  Foremost is both authors' writing about Indian spiritualism far ahead of its becoming popular in the West.  But, in my estimation, while Siddhartha grapples with some of the core issues of such spiritualism, Razor's Edge treats it as an interesting spotlight to contrast with Western society.  Moreover, Hesse approaches the spiritualism whole-heartedly, as if his salvation depended on understanding it.  But Maugham seems to treat the spiritualism as mere fodder for one of his many books, as if he might forget the material as soon as he started his next book.<br /><br />Still, Maugham is an excellent writer, and at times his prose succinctly captures salient aspects of Indian spiritualism (at least to the extent that I understand it).  At one point, claiming some modesty, Maugham writes: \\"I am not attempting here to give anything in the nature of a description of the philosophical system of the Vedanta.\\"  That may be true, but some of Maugham's crisp sentences convey significant insight:<br /><br />\\"But that poor little drop of water, when it has once more become one with the sea, has surely lost its individuality.\\"  Larry's response: \\"What is individuality but the expression of our egoism?  Until the soul has shed the last trace of that it cannot become one with the Absolute.\\"<br /><br />\\"I have always felt that there was something pathetic in the founders of religion who made it a condition of salvation that you should believe in them.  It's as though they needed your faith to have faith in themselves.\\"l as soon as he started his next book.

B00005MNP8|5.0|Frankly, it's not my favorite Blondie album.  That honor belongs to Plastic Letters, followed by Eat to the Beat.<br /><br />Still, most objective critics consider this to be THE definitive classic Blondie album, and it's hard to argue.<br /><br />With classic songs like Heart of Glass and One Way or Another, THIS is the album that put Blondie on the charts.<br /><br />For those who might have been confused about all the various \\"versions\\" of Heart of Glass that seem to be floating around, the version on this album IS the best one, with the best ending.

B00005Q4CS|1.0|I heard a lot of critical praise for Darren Aronofsky's latest work which was at the time \\"Requiem for a dream\\". I was familiar with Ellen Burstyn and I recognized her in the classic blockbuster \\"The Exorcist\\". I loved Jennifer Connelly's performance in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". I have seen several of Jared Leto's work, so I was lookin foreword to seeing this film. I saw \\"Pi\\" a surreal drama by Aronofsky. I liked it, although it kind of freaked me out. I knew that the premise of the film was about drug use and addiction. When I brought the movie home I made sure that I rented the \\"R\\" rated version. I watched it and by the end I was speechless. The frequent graphic depiction of drug use, mainly use of heroin is seen throughout the film. The disturbing nasty addiction of diet pills is seen as well, as well as nightmarish flashbacks. I was so disturbed and distraught.     The film depicts the lives of four individuals, whose drug problems ulitmately lead them into a down-ward spiral into hell. Literally I mean that. I got so upset watching the film, that I had to skip some scenes. I almost vomitted. This movie is not for the faint of heart. I am a strong minded person who until know, thought could handle any movie hollywood throws at them. I couldn't see it. All of the performances are excellent, but this is clearly a terrible film.
B000001ES9|5.0|If there were any justice in the world, this would rank in the same class as Led Zeppelin IV, Deep Purple's Machine Head, and other classic hard rock albums of the era.<br /><br />True Rush fans usually completely ignore the first album, before drummer Neil Peart joined the band. True, John Rutsey was just a drummer and not a huge influence on the band, but to my mind Rush's first album remains a virtually ignored classic. Called the \\"poor man's Led Zeppelin\\" when it was released, it nonetheless remains a gold standard in bone-crunching heavy metal music. Several tracks showcase the virtuoso playing ability of the band, and the album did manage to produce one classic song: \\"Working Man.\\"

It's also been called the first \\"concept album.\\" But if you take away all the \\"hippie zeitgeist\\" that accompanied its release, then it, like other Beatles albums, is just another collection of songs. John Lennon even admitted as much, saying that, other than the \\"theme\\" song and the reprise of same toward the end, the album's songs could have ended up on just about any other Beatles album. No \\"concept album\\" here.

0307341550|2.0|A well-written fake.<br />None of the characters (or the crimes, for that matter) are believable, especially Amma, protagonist's 13-yr old half-sister. The teen culture described by Flynn is especially laughable. Kids don't feel like that, don't behave like that, and don't talk like that.<br />Camille, the seriously messed-up narrator, is tremendously irritating and unpleasant. I have little sympathy for psychotics, and her character, the way it was developed by Flynn, does not have a lot of depth. Camille is tediously dull, monotone, and inept as a reporter. Basically, she takes baths, drinks burbon, throws up and cries A LOT throughout the story. It is unclear to me why she keeps staying at her monster-of-a-mother's house, while her Chicago boss keeps reminding her that she could go home at any time if she feels uncomfortable. But no - Camille passively chooses to wallow in self-pity and misery. She is clearly a masochist.<br />It is equally unclear what exactly makes her so attractive to the \\"chicklet-toothed\\" detective Richard (another unlikable character who has no substance).<br />Camille's sexual promiscuity does not make me like her more, though I am no prude. I guess that has to do with how cold and detached she is. Maybe she is supposed to be \\"tough\\" in the face of evil, and I am supposed to feel sorry for her, but somehow I just don't. IMHO, Camille is simply morose.<br />The story comes to this: a freak girl comes to freak town and deals with a lot of freaks, headed by her freak immediate family members.<br />I am not debating that the novel is well-written. It is rich in detail, very visual, and has better parts. However, upon reading it, I was left with sort of a bad taste in my mouth. The book is really nasty and revolting, and when a female writer comes up with something like this, I think that there is something really wrong with her.<br />This view of life is depressing and dark, and I really don't appreciate writers whose flair comes to naturalistically describing their character's vomit and other bodily secretions in detail.

Yes, it is very dark, but brilliant, and I could re-read it again and again.   \\"Sharp Objects\\" somehow resembles \\"In the Cut\\" by Susanna Moore. I threw it out of my house immediately upon reading it, I disliked it so much.   Something is missing in Flynn's novel. It is too cold and unpleasant on every level - if you enjoy these emotions, read it.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig did a fantastic job as the new 007, and in no way did he disappoint by trying to change the original James Bond persona.  Hard edge, direct, interestingly cool, and sexy as hell- yes, Bond is back! I enjoyed his love-hate relationship with M (a welcome return by superb Judi Dench), and thought the scene where Bond breaks into M's house (to search her computer for some valuable information) and is caught by M, who reprimands Bond as he's about to leave with, \\"Don't ever break into my house again,\\" a very nice touch. This scene is a primary example of the love-hate relationship between Bond and his superior, M.  \\"Casino Royale\\" opens with a great scene of Craig doing the famous \\"gun barrel\\" shot which phases into an artistic title sequence while the \\"theme song\\" plays.  Bond fans will appreciate the chase scenes with Bond and terrorist plotters, both at a high rise construction sight and at an airport. Thrilling jumps and leaps from the high rise are awesome and the fight between Bond and a terrorist attempting to blow up a plane with a fuel truck is excitingly played out.  And let's not forget about the Bond girls!  Exotic beauty Caterina Murino who first captivates Bond with her beauty, and later pays for her involvement with him with her life.  The movie locales are sumptuous and give the film that \\"Bond\\" movie look and feel that Bond fans have grown to know and expect.<br /><br />Giving the fine performance that Pierce Brosnan gave as the ultimate suave and debonair Bond, it was difficult to imagine anyone else taking on the role.  When Daniel Craig was named as the \\"new James Bond,\\" many fans felt as I did- \\"who is this guy?\\"  I'm glad to be able to say that Craig not only succeeded in the role, but also took it to new heights!  I'm eager now to see what the next \\"James Bond\\" movie will comprise of.  Will there be a \\"new\\" Moneypenny?  And will we see a new \\"Q\\" introducing all kinds of high-tech gadgets for Bond to use while on Her Majesty's Secret Service?  After having just seen \\"Casino Royale,\\" it makes me want to return to the very beginning of the Bond films and start with \\"Dr. No\\" and watch each of the \\"Bond\\" films, one per night, until I have seen them all.  The \\"Casino Royale\\" 2-disc Special Edition DVD is a total blast and is highly recommended for unabashed high rise thrills, airport chases, and attempted murders at Casino tables. And I believe all my fellow James Bond fans will join me in joyously proclaiming BOND IS BACK!!After having just seen \\"Casino Royale,\\" it makes me want to return to the very beginning of the Bond films and start with \\"Dr. No\\" and watch each of the \\"Bond\\" films, one per night, until I have seen them all.

B000T05R90|5.0|As good a song as See Emily Play is-----[ and it isn't on this cd ] it is still only a \\"pop\\" song. I listen to Pink Floyd for the ACID ROCK music they made such as Astronomy Domine and Interstellar Overdrive. This is still a great album but nowhere near as great as More. Many people thought that all More was.... was a sound track. Too bad they never took the time to really listen to it. Pink Floyd actually has more of a jazz influence than many people realize. All of the early Pink Floyd albums are fantastic....up until The Wall when they became waaaay toooo political for my taste. That isn't to say they didn't create great music because everything they have ever done is great. I have been listening to them since 1969 and even saw them in Seattle at the Moore Theatre in 1970 [among at least 6 other times at various venues {including San Diego in 1975} until about 1978]and I never,ever tire of listening to their music. Buy all of their early music and experience many aural wonders!!!!
B000P2A256|5.0|I walk to this CD daily, I am just playing the heck out of it, just like I did with SAJ. The only thing is Adam can push the envelope with the lyrics/songs and you got to watch the kiddies. My favorites: 'I'm not falling apart\\" and \\"Nothing lasts forever\\". \\"Kiwi\\" is nasty, and I'm no prude ;)
B000093BDX|5.0|Fantastic album. All my old time favorites.  Such great music to relax and share.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Schwartz is intelligent and witty and he uses the words and the music to create an amazing blend of song.  This is without doubt the best musical I have ever heard, and I have heard a lot of musicals!!!
B00003XACV|4.0|Thomas Newman has a style all his own.  I liked the soundtrack for the Series of Unfortunate Events and American Beauty is right up there!  It is light, refreshing, and mellow.  I only wish the soundtrack had more tracks and had a longer run time.
B000HOMU98|3.0|Great move but the transfer to blu-ray DVD wasn't vary good.  Most parts of the movie are grainy.  I expected a better quality transfer for a landmark movie such as this one.  They could have at least remastered the movie but instead it looks like they made a DVD copy with slightly higher resolution.  If you have the DVD version of this movie stick with it.  It's probably looks the same.
0312330537|5.0|FINALLY, a gut-wrenching, harrowing, well-penned novel, whose author suffers not from the literary constipation of most current \\"highbrow\\" authors (He's faced down far more deadly things, chronicled herein, to be affrighted by sharp penned editors.) - A book, in short, that will make your heart bleed with the depths to which the human soul can sink and the glories to which it can rise. ----I read so many books, but this is the first true work of art and genius published in this new century that I've managed to discover.  It is a book from which I'm still recovering from having read.  Like all great art, it leaves one with a new perspective on the world and causes one to reconnoitre the heart's bearings.  The book strips away the lies we tell ourselves and leaves the heartstrings bare for the reader to see, where he/ she will recognise his/her own.<br /><br />Let's get something straight here:  This is not a book of \\"purple prose\\" or any form of sentimentality.  Each tear shed is wrung from harrowing experience.  As Roberts writes, \\"One of the reasons we crave love, and seek it so desperately, is that love is the only cure for loneliness, and shame, and sorrow.  But some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them again.  Some truths about yourself are so painful that only shame can help you live with them.  And some things are just so sad that only your soul can do the crying for you.\\"--Your soul will have cried with Roberts's many times before the end of the book.<br /><br />This is truly a book for lovers of great literature.  Roberts writes, \\"I never found a club or a clan or idea that was more important to me than the men and women who believed in it.\\"--This book is one that values the mystery of people and the mystery of human existence above all else. ----Including yours, reader.
B000RJO578|5.0|This was a GREAT movie.  Much more than I expected.  It was funny, captivating and full of suspense.  I can safely say that I will watch the next movie these guys are in.  I wish more movies were this original and entertaining.
B000N7FF0A|5.0|I read this book over a year ago and still it is my number one best book!  Jodi Picoult keeps you on the edge until you have the whole thing figured out and then hits you with an amazing ending.  Actually took my breath away- this book!  It is a must read!!!!!!!!!! You will not regret it!
B000F3T7X8|5.0|I bought this album on Lp many years ago when it was first released. I enjoyed it then. Some of the tracks never made a big impression on me, but I generally liked the entire album. GTP is a development from \\"Quiet Life\\" and probably represents, for some, Japan's finest album - \\"Tin Drum\\", several years later, saw Japan going in quite a different direction.<br /><br />The good tracks far outweigh the \\"filler\\" here and some of the music is sublime - \\"Swing\\" and \\"Taking Islands in Africa\\" still intrigue me. The use of the Roland Compu-rhythm drum machine with Steve Jansen's drumming is very effective. Jansen is a very fine musician indeed. The synthesizer playing is imaginative and very impressive.<br /><br />The measure of this album is that much of it still sounds fresh today and it still suggests pathways of music and ideas that may be explored.
0312954468|4.0|A most egaging novel.  I have just ordered the next two books in the series.  I couldn't get enough.  Taita, the eunich, a genius in arts, mechinations, life and the other world beyond ours guards and influences Lostris and Tannis a couple destined to be together but seems to be at odds with what the \\"Gods have planned\\".  Linked with the evil Lord Intef and the Immortal Pharoah, their lives are filled with war and love.  The author brings us into the life of ancient Egypt as if we have actually been there.  The descriptions of everyday life and death are startling lifelike.  I was unexpectedly impressed and hooked.
0671042858|2.0|\\"The girl who loved Tom Gordon\\" By Stephen King.<br /><br />In June of 1998 Trisha McFarland has gone on a hike on the Maine branch of the Appalachian Trail with her brother and recently divorced Mother. As usual her mother and brother are arguing. Trisha has to pee so she leaves the trail and low and behold becomes lost in the woods......<br /><br />This has to be one of the worst books Kings has written and I have read quite a few of them. The story as mentioned revolves around Trisha over a period of 9 days as she tries to find her way out of the woods. There are no other immediate characters and therefore no interaction, almost no dialogue, and almost nothing interesting happening for 260+ pages.<br /><br />The Good: Nothing really comes to mind<br /><br />The bad: As mentioned this story is completely boring. You are essentially reading the daily goings on of a 9 year old girl lost in the woods which is not interesting in the least. To make a bad story worse the main character Trisha is not believable as a 9 year old and hence doesn't work. I noticed that she constantly thinks and talks (to herself of course) about things I don't think most 9 year olds in 1998 would know about or think about. She mentions \\"MASH\\" the TV show, she mentions \\"I love Lucy\\". How many 9 year olds have seen these shows? She mentions V.C. Andrews. How many 9 year olds in 1998 have viewed \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" or read the book? She makes reference to a \\"Serta Perfect Sleeper\\" mattress and also to receiving junk mail. I just didn't get the since that this was a 9 year old girl. It seemed more like the memories of a 50-60 something writer were slipping into the story.<br /><br />Overall: Skip this at all cost. If the Author's name wasn't \\"Stephen King\\" I don't think this would have ever been published. Try something else.

B000N3SS80|5.0|I have a lot of albums by latin pop artists from many countries, but I've never so much as listened to another album by Jennifer Lopez. I bought this because I know Marc Anthony collaborated on it, so I thought I'd see how it went. All I knew of JLo is that she is constantly in the tabloids, and I'd seen some music videos at the gym that didn't impress me. I'm pleased to say this is an excellent album. I love lavishly produced pop music; what I like in general about latin pop is that it has resisted to a certain extent the \\"gangsta\\" sound that seems to have infiltrated a lot  of American pop. This album really showcases her as a romantic latin singer firmly within the traditions of latin pop, not American English-language pop. That is part of what makes it so special. I highly recommend it. I can't wait for another album in Spanish from her. Felicitaciones, JLo, por un excelente trabajo que muestra tu madurez y tu arte.
B0009MDPYW|4.0|good against evil. the two come together in this movie, through the oldest form in the book. excorsisms and demons. keanu was a great constantine. you know there's just some people who were made for their roles, and this man is it. great actor, really gives it his all. from speed, the devils advocate, the lake house, and now this. flawless performance, no complaints all compliments. and his costar rachel weisz worked excellent as well. she was great in the mummy part one and two, she had me applauding her in the jury, and now here, i was impressed. nicely done, great actress. constantine is one of my favorites, it's a pleaser. the man fights demons, he has a ticket strait to hell, but he's not going without taking with him a few freaks. he meets this psychic and they battle the forces of evil side by side. and in the end, as always good triumphs over evil. constantine's debt is repaid, and he must go on doing what he does best. splendid movie certainly deserves some great props.

B000002OX7|5.0|This is about as good as it gets.  So much praise has been heaped on this record, and it's not hype at all.

B0007MAO0M|4.0|A good western, and yet. For one it is slightly too slow at times. That makes the film a little bit lengthy and that is not good in a western that must have a constant rhythm and when it slows down it is to create suspense in a situation that requires it. Here we have slow scenes that are not in anyway suspenseful. The second reason is that this film has little originality. It is a clear assemblage or patchwork of many references and borrowings from all the previous westerns ever made. And it is very difficult to invent anything in 1985 after also the Morricone and Clint Eastwood films, not to speak of the black and white TV series mile Dead or Alive. It is entertaining because of the way things are assembled and that is nearly all. Two elements create some perspective. First the presence of black settlers that reveal the strong racist trend in the West. Then the character of Stella, a midget saloon manageress. But apart from these two elements the rest is pretty standard. But I must admit the setting, the scenery is particularly beautiful. Some of the mountain and desert scenes are in gorgeous natural surroundings. Then the theme of the rotten sheriff (two in the film mind you, one rotten by authority and the other rotten by the local rancher) and the theme of the rancher who decides to push away, and kill if necessary, the farmers are very ordinary and common place, and once again nothing new is really added to the theme. All these borrowing, even in 1985, make the film systematically anaphoric and that is a shortcoming. Even the street duel is banal: check in Back to the Future III, the \\"character\\" of Clint Eastwood makes that anaphoric reference a lot more creative. Not here.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|This is a well conceived and executed death metal album from the Polish masters. As a whole, this album incorporates fewer eastern influenced scales than Behemoth's newest offering, The Apostasy, and stays closer to more traditional (if I can use the word) death and black metal scales. Though there are still traces of black metal on this album, they are relatively buried beneath an assault of crushing death metal. The intro to the title track is evidence of this residual black metal influence, with the horns paying the root to an augmented cord sequence, while the second guitar borrows notes from two different scales. This shouldn't work at all from any theoretical standpoint, but it totally works sonically. While black metal musicians use techniques like this all the time, it's rare to hear it in death metal.    Another important difference between this album and Behemoth's newest is the individuality of each song. This album can be taken as a whole or as a collection of songs. At least for me, The Apostasy is best experienced as a single entity. From this perspective, Demigod is stronger because of this.    From a lyrical perspective, Behemoth breaks no new ground with Demigod, but uses themes very much within the \\"orthodox\\" satanic worldview: \\"I worship the god in me, and I hate all the foolish sheep who lack the power to become gods themselves.\\" The actual words and syllabication employed on this album, however, are masterful. \\"Slaves Shall Serve\\" puts this band's view perfectly.    Overall, this is an album well worth the money, assuming you like aggressive death metal. Each song is well crafted, and the band has enough sense not to let their musicianship turn to self-indulgence, with \\"Demigod\\" and \\"Conquer All\\" serving as prime examples.
B000V39KDO|1.0|I rented it, paid for it and now I can't watch it. Since I can't watch it, I give this movie 1 star. I called for help, but the people that can help me are not working now. What a rip-off. I guess I'll have to go to Walmart. It's no wonder the Walton family are so rich.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I had never heard of Serenity but when I bought by HD-DVD player wanted a sci-fi film to try out.  I bought Serenity and watched it.  Then I watched it again.  Every time I watched it I loved it more and more.  This film is amazing!  The cast is great, the story is great!  I then discovered there was an original series called Firefly so I just had to have it.  Gotta say I love the series more than the film and can't understand why it was cancelled.  Once again those morons at the Sci-fi channel have killed off what is a superb program (just like they did with SG-1).  I really hope that in the near future Joss Whedon (a genius) will find a backer that wants to bring back Firefly.  It has the fans, it has the demand.  It's a winner!!
6305907145|1.0|This would have been an interesting movie if the film makers had titled it something other than \\"Mansfield Park.\\"  However, since they chose to present it as a rendition of the Jane Austen novel, I think they took far too many liberties with the story.    The biggest difference was in the character of Fanny Price.  No matter how badly we in the twenty-first century want to believe it, she was *not* a modern, outspoken, independent woman.  She was deeply conservative.  If the film makers disliked that aspect, why choose this book to film at all?      No film can completely capture the spirit of a novel.  But when I watch an adaptation I want to feel that it was created with a fundamental level of understanding of the book, and appreciation for it.  This film fails.

If you've read the first nine and loved the character and what he stood for you'll be disappointed with ten and eleven.  I think I'll pass on number twelve altogether.

B0002S947K|4.0|At the 2005 Newport Folk Festival, an artist I'd never heard before took the stage and began to play a midday set. I'd not heard the name Ray LaMontagne before, but once he played his set (concluding with \\"All The Wild Horses\\" and a rocking blues number that is not on either of his studio albums), I was hooked. Fortunately, it was announced from the stage that Ray would be signing CD's from a booth on the fairway, I was there. He and his guitarist signed my copy of \\"Trouble\\" and - on the long drive home - this CD played and I became a fan.<br /><br />With an airy yet husky voice and spacious accompaniment, LaMontagne recalls many of the folksingers of the 70's (James Taylor and Gordon Lightfoot) as well as the spiritual heft of Van Morrison. (Or perhaps \\"[[ASIN:B000001EG4 Tumbleweed Connection]]\\" Elton John.) For contemporary peers, there are David Gray or a richer Sam Beam. There is a wealth of emotion to be found here, be it the joy of the title song or the wistful \\"All The Wild Horses,\\" Ray LaMontagne's debut is a charmer. If you enjoy this, his follow-up, \\"[[ASIN:B000GPIPVU Till the Sun Turns Black]],\\" is just as rich but a darker and more complex record, maybe even better than this one.
630460288X|4.0|This movie is quite the futuristic hoot.  Taco Bell has won the fast food wars and is now a fine restaurant.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was once president of America.  If you curse, you get a ticket violation, no matter where you are.  The outfits that people wear on a typical occasion are more like costume robes.  Physical touch is no longer allowed between partners, and is only done by virtual means instead.  And lastly, the Los Angeles area is now clean and all the suburbs have formed a new city known as San Angeles.  Well, its all just a part of the humor added to this film, which surprisingly is a highly entertaining B action movie, with some of today's above average B movie stars.<br /><br />While Sly Stallone is our main man and cop hero, Wesley Snipes and Sandra Bullock steal the show too with their abundant screen time.  Snipes is the villain in this movie, and his character is completely opposite than want you would typically see in his most popular films, the Blade series.  Though he is the hero in Blade, it is obvious he has a very dark, villainous side in those films.  But in Demolition Man, he is more like a Dennis Rodman charcater (and looks like him too), who jokes at everything and everyone while either killing them or blowing up the place.  Sandra Bullock is the young cop, who's passion is for nostalgia L.A.  She is the cop who wants something to actually go wrong in this perfect future, and her wish comes true when Simon Phoenix (Snipes) is brought back after about 30 years of cryo-freeze, once again wreaking havoc on the city.  John Spartan (Sly) is brought back to catch him, since he is the only one who knows how to tame a criminal of the past.<br /><br />This movie has quite a bit of action, and just about everything you could ask for - guns, explosions, car chases, and fist fights.  Its basically Stallone vs Snipes throughout this film, and their presence alone in the action scenes kicks it up a notch compared to most action actors.  Their final fight in the film is less than 2 minutes, but it is fast and hard-hitting and I still enjoyed it quite a bit.  In addition to the action, there is plenty of humor in the film too.  The plot is not extensive, but this kind of movie just doesn't need it.<br /><br />Demolition Man comes off as very silly at first, but it does have a way of engaging you.

0316010669|4.0|Good book.      Go with the gut.  If you feel you should read it, read it.    If you feel it isnt for you, you are probably right.    That is pretty much the book's premise.  Your first instinct is right.  We spend our time \\"deciding\\", but really it is just following through and supporting the decision we have already made.    I have talked to people about this book and shared some of the concepts.    What I wish we could do is have the marital prediction folks he writes about available to everyone.  If people headed their predictions, the countries divorce rate would be at like 10%.  Imagine that!  What I am talking about is a section where he discusses someone's ability to observe a couple and predict within like 90%+ who will get divorced.     Some spiritual elements to this book if you ask me.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Note: This review contains Spoilers.  I have to admit, I was a little concerned when the second season began.  I mean, having Marshall and Lily break up was kind of a downer.  But I'm glad I decided to keep watching, because this year easily contains some of the show's funniest episodes.  My wife and I put on \\"Slap Bet\\" anytime we need a little pick-me-up.  And of course, there's the \\"Robin Sparkles\\" episode, in which Cobie Smulders (like the show itself, a criminally-underrated comic actress) really gets a chance to shine.  \\"Swarley\\" is a Barney Stinson classic.  And \\"Arrivederci, Fiero\\" may be the biggest laugh-getter of the season.<br /><br />How I Met Your Mother may never quite achieve Classic Sitcom status.  And you know, that's really fine with me.  I wouldn't want too much success to go to their heads.  But I'll keep watching and laughing myself silly.
0345457692|5.0|If you like hardboiled SF as much as I do, you've got to put this one on your Must Read list. If Dashiell Hammett had written SF (and knew something about 21st Century science) this is what he would have written. It has all the elements of the classic hardboiled detective story---the tough as nails PI, Takeshi Kovacs, whose personality was \\"needlecast\\" to Earth from Harlan's World where it had been sentenced to 100 years in storage for an unspecified crime, the client's sexy wife who happens to be 300 years old but inhabits the body of a teenager, the love/hate relationship with a police lieutenant whose ex-lover's body Kovacs is currently using, the doublecross, the beatdowns including virtual reality torture---it's got it all. It's good in terms of SF as well. The author has fun exploring the permutations that arise from the ability to download personalities into vacant bodies as well as its effect on society. It's a first novel but you'd never know it from the quality of the writing. There have been 2 other Takeshi Kovacs novel since this one. It's a keeper.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|This film is really under-rated and overlooked. I rented it first on a friend's recommendation and promply went to Amazon and bought it. I've watched it 4 times already and lent it out to several friends who also bought it. I understand that this has become a cult favorite especially in England and am not surprised. It's an interestingly presented story that appears to be just another teenage angst piece at first glance but the further you get into the movie, the more you realize that there is a whole lot more going on. I strongly recommend this for anyone who enjoys movies that are not only out of the mainstream but cut a whole new river of their own.

0385522401|3.0|Before starting this review - I skimmed a few other reviews of \\"On Chesil Beach\\". It's a rare moment when I do not have a strong opinion on a book - but this is one of those times.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed McEwan's books - though I wouldn't go as far as to say that I loved any one of them (although I am still determined to reread \\"Atonement\\" again now that I've read the ending). But this one...this one...<br /><br />This book hinges on on small but hugely pivotal moment in the lives of two people. McEwan develops the characters well and gives the reader enough information to prepare us for and involve us in that moment. The reader is there, along with Florence and Edward, on their wedding night, knowing, as they do, that something monumental is going to happen, yet unsure just what that might be. The tension mounts, the anticipation increases...<br /><br />Following the turning point of the book - we are only given the point of view of Edward. With only a few token references to Florence - the book is then a one-sided affair - leaving the reader with MANY unanswered questions... \\"What happened THEN?\\" being my major one.<br /><br />In today's world of much too much information about sex and relationships - the inability of Florence and Edward to talk about sex seems almost unreal. In many ways - McEwan conveys the idea that in those times, for these characters - \\"There were no words\\". Though I was not there to experience the world before the sexual revolution - this book seems to give a good representation of it. The unspoken feelings, questions, desires...the terror and mystery... The reader can feel the tension between the characters, smell the poorly cooked food, hear the creak of the honeymoon suite bed...so many vividly drawn details...until it was time for the details I really wanted.<br /><br />I am a sucker for the \\"what if?\\" aspect of books...and with this one - I was disappointed.<br /><br />Doesn't mean I won't be early in line to pick up his next book, though...
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I don't care about Grindhouse not being packaged with Planet Terror.  True, in order for the whole grindhouse concept to be fully experienced as intended, you really have to see both movies jointed together.  Otherwise it's kinda like getting a cheeseburger without the fries.  And I don't care about the trailers not being included either which--I'm sorry--except for Machete, were really overrated and much ado about nothing.<br /><br />The real problem with the release of Death Proof is that it is a terrible movie that will cause more than a few people who skipped it at the theaters to be nearly bored to death and ultimately disappointed in the comfort of their homes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I'm a Tarantino fan from back when Reservoir Dogs was first released.  Of the films he's directed; I absolutely loved Reservoir Dogs.  Pulp Fiction is a timeless classic that will be on t.v. forty years from now.  Jackie Brown is the closest he's come to making a serious, grown-up film and it's one of my favorite films of all time.  Kill Bill?  C'mon... that movie rocked too hard, I consider it in the pantheon of some of the greatest action/drama/homage flicks of all time.<br /><br />So after a long wait for the next piece of genius, we get Death Proof.<br /><br />- The story:  The story had potential.  It had a lot of potential.  A stunt man serial killer who uses his car to take people out.  Great idea.  Tarantino does nothing with it.  Compare how much screen time the women get compared to Stunt man Mike and his car.  Douglas is on screen for scant minutes while the rest of the film follows around a bunch of characters who talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, and talk....<br /><br />- The film making:  The movie looks good and is shot well.  But that's like taking a great high-def picture of a really ugly person.<br /><br />- The action:  He should have called it Action Proof.  A little truth in advertising.  Frankly, the car chase at the end, I guess since itwas hyped so much, was okay.  But I couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to say, \\"Hey, why don't you just brake to a stop and let the woman climb off the freakin' hood already?\\"  You want to see a great car chase, watch The Matrix Reloaded.  You want to go to sleep and you're out of Ambien, watch Death Proof without the surround sound on.<br /><br />- The characters:  Again, Kurt Russel was awesome and his character could have been become the next Jules or Mr. White.  Instead, he does nothing with it.  The women could not be more forgettable.<br /><br />- That famous QT dialouge:  The is the movie's fatal flaw.  And it's all those numbskull media types and film reviewers who can't stop fawning over the dialouge in QT's movies.  Tarantino read too much of his own good press.  At some point he decided that if a little was good, alot more was better.  Wrong.  Put too much fertilyzer in your grass and you kill it.  Watching this film and listening to these characters talk at some points seemed like a Saturday Night Live parody of a Tarantino film.  Not the reaction you want the audience to have.  Note to QT, when they start giving out Oscars for dialouge, I'd be this indulgent.  Until then, just shoot the movie.<br /><br />- Bottom line:  The film is ultimately very self-indulgent.  I believe he sat in an editing room, watching the final cut of this mess thinking he'd knocked it out the park; hopelessly in love with every syllable of his trade-mark dialog that starts off boring, becomes ridiculous at points, then meaders along until it becomes so tedious and annoying that it takes you right out the film.  Someone else on this site wrote that when you're QT, no studio is going to try and edit you and I agree.  That's a gamble a studio takes.  This studio gambled and lost (several tens of millions of dollars).  More likely, he felt confident that his vision would be commercially accepted because everything he'd touched before had turned to gold.  Well this one is big lump of mud.  Did I mention I did not like this film?
B000I9YX06|5.0|I've read some reviews where people have commented that Wil Smith's was awkward, bad acting, goofy, Big Bird etc and obviously everyone is entitled to their opnion (hence this site ) but I totally disagree. I feel that his acting skills improved in this movie. Also, the story was said to have too many implausible themes but most movies do. If I wanted to watch a movie based on a true story I would and if I did then maybe I would comment on what was and was not plausible. I think the movie was thought provoking, action filled, good acting and a nice story line. Kept me entertained..
B000V4NX04|5.0|Having heard that this movie won the oscar for best foreign language film in 2006, I was dubious about how much I would like it, since I had wanted \\"Water\\" to win the oscar.  However, I was pleasantly surprised about this movie.  The ending is phenomenal.  It is truly a Sonata for a Good Man.  Very powerful, it is also a reminder about what an oppresive government can do to a society.

0143038419|5.0|For me, this book was inspiring and fun.  The writing was snappy and the author amusing and very human.  I have loaned my copy to a couple of friends because it just seems like the \\"pass it along\\" type of book for women.  I honestly felt a little sad when I finished reading it, because I wanted it to keep on going.  For me, that's the sign of a good read.
B00005JPQQ|3.0|\\"Oceans 13\\" starts with the 70-ish music and slick opening credit, both making me anticipate something thrilling and entertaining is coming in the next two hours. The film's opening sequence (after Rusty's funny ringtone) quickly moves, setting up the initial part of the story. In short in \\"Oceans 13\\" Danny Ocean and the boys come back to Las Vegas, not for money but for revenge or for too trusting Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) who was deceived and suffered heart attack.    So far the film is great. Then always reliable Eddie Izzard arrives and I thought Ocean's plans for the casino robbery would begin immediately. However, more than one hour in, the guys are still preparing for their robbery and their plans get more and more complicated and it becomes clear that more than one big contraption is needed to do what they are supposed to do. By the time they put into practice their elaborate plans, sorry, but I lost interest.    Not that \\"Oceans 13\\" is waste of time. George Clooney as Danny Ocean and some of his friends, especially Brad Pitt as Rusty shine with charisma, but considering their talent, that is not a surprise. Al Pacino's \\"villainous\\" casino owner is more interesting as character (with possible references to real-life persons), and so are the amusing turns from veterans like Carl Reiner and David Paymer as \\"V. U. P.\\"    Still female roles are sadly disappointing (even though I am aware the film is about \\"Ocean's 13\\"), and the scene where Ellen Barkin is seduced by Matt Damon (with a false nose) with a help of \\"Gilroy\\" is embarrassing to see. Some actors like Julian Sands and Vincent Cassel are called in, but they are not given chance to show their talent.    In spite of its great \\"all-star\\" cast, the real star of \\"Oceans 13\\" is Steven Soderbergh's camera work and the city of Las Vegas. Soderbergh fills the screen with colors like red and gold and even uses techniques like split screen.     \\"Oceans 13\\" is much better than its predecessor \\"12\\" but shares the same weakness as \\"Shrek 3,\\"\\"Spider-Man 3\\"and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" other third installments of popular series released this year: lots of things going on but not enough story in it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I've never liked the old Spector-produced LET IT BE.  It's an absurdity: some of the best material The Beatles ever recorded presented alongside... some of the worst.       LET IT BE failed in many ways, and not least because it highlighted the central problem in the band at the time - that John was in a creative tailspin while Paul was reaching his peak.  What Spector desperately needed to do, he couldn't do.  Given a long recording of the horrendous and embarrassing \\"Dig It\\", he thought he could minimize its damage to the album by cutting it shorter.  No way.  He should have dumped it into the nearest wastebasket and told John the truth - that it stank.  He also thought he could lighten the mood with a bit of charming pub-song.  Not!  Before this project could work, both \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" would have to go.  Now they're gone.      LET IT BE... NAKED is essentially three successive groups of songs:    1) Paul, John and George blues-rock (\\"Get Back\\", \\"Dig a Pony\\", \\"For You Blue\\")  2) Lennon-McCartney retro numbers (\\"Two of Us\\", \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", \\"One After 909\\")  3) George, John and Paul \\"spirituals\\" (\\"I Me Mine\\", \\"Across the Universe\\", \\"Let It Be\\")    The sequencing of these songs by composer is palindromic - P  J  G   /   JP  JP  JP   /   G  J  P - a subtle tribute to John, who early on did some notable numbers utilizing harmonic (\\"Ask Me Why\\") or structural (\\"I'll Be Back\\") palindromes.  Also, in that the playlist both begins and ends with Paul McCartney (\\"Get Back\\" and \\"Let It Be\\") the new album acknowledges Paul as the driving force behind the project and the principal composer in the Beatles at that time.  Filling out the list and separating groups one from two and two from three are the two love songs - Paul's \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and the newly added alternate take of John's \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" (nice move!).     There are also some revelations in the newly scrubbed sound.  \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", for one.  Prior to the release of this disc I had never enjoyed it at all, thinking it crude and uninspired and the enthusiasm contrived and unconvincing.  Now however, with George and John's guitar interplay evident, we have a window into what it was that the guys were responding to.    I'll admit I would have been happier with the girls' voices restored to \\"Across the Universe\\".  I also wonder about the decision to keep the Spector extension of \\"I Me Mine\\", but now I'm just quibbling.      To those who might say that LET IT BE, as soundtrack to the film, shouldn't be tampered with, I'd ask whether there is not something oddly circular in that reasoning.  LET IT BE is not A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  The guys didn't set out to do a film; they merely filmed themselves rehearsing in the studio.  In 1970, the band, frustrated and out of patience with one another, tossed this stuff onto Spector and allowed it to be released as a \\"soundtrack\\".  This new disc is the welcome result of the survivors having given up that pretense, and now we have a beautifully edited album which can stand with their others.
1594489505|5.0|It seems, at least for me, that I hear about the news in other countries; and, for a moment, I stop and think, \\"How sad.\\"  This book tells the real story and is an eye opener for all who read it.  I enjoyed this book thoroughly.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best war movies ever...they avoided unnecessary romance, kept the characters in balance (i.e. no one \\"john wayne\\" hero, but a realistic cast).    The movie correctly shows the surprise attack in terms of American naivete' and leadership blunders rather than as a conspiracy by the Roosevelt administration to get America into the war. This probably bugs conspiracy theorists, but thats fine by me...    There was very good attention to detail in many aspects of the movie. The Zeros are believable, and the scene where they take off at dawn is wonderful, right down to the sunrise and the smoke pot at the end of the carrier deck. I also noticed at the scene early on where Yamamoto boards the ship, there is a detachment of Japanese \\"marines\\" as honor guard, in slightly different uniforms from the Navy men, as they would indeed have been. Don't know if it actually happened that way, but the effect is believable.  Theres a couple of scenes where the torpedo bombers (Jap) in the distance have a pilot but the other 2 crewmen appear to be missing - but you have to look to notice. There is also the scene where LT Kaminsky reports the submarine contact to his superior who is shaving at home. He wipes away the shaving cream to answer the phone and he's already smooth-shaven! Ah, well:)...    The effects are EXCELLENT, esp. considering this was a 1970 film....  Army Air Corps aviators Taylor and Welch were portrayed, but were a bit goofy acting. Maybe thats to be expected, as young military pilots are wont to be!  The scene where the band starts playing right as the attack commences is almost funny - the conductor has them playing fast halfway through it as though he wants to finish before they bolt away...kinda humorous:)    This is so much better than the movie \\"Midway\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\" with their romances and dramas, theres really no comparison. Those two were terrible in comparison. Midway especially had a lot of over-acting.    The Japanese actors playing Yamamoto and Nagumo were especially credible. So were Bratton and Kramer. The true inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy intelligence and de-coding teams was not heavily emphasized, but it does not take away from the movie.      I highly recommend this flick - its one of the better war movies of all time in my opinion.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|A must have for any 90210 fan. Takes you way back to the early 90s and teen drama. And no matter how many times you've already seen the episodes you have to have them on DVD! A great trip down memory lane!
B00003CXTG|1.0|No wonder almost half the reviewers here gave this flick 3 stars or less...  Shallow plot, way over romanced, and farfetched (how on earth could the fighter pilots have gone to bombers - carrier bombers at that - in that kind of timeframe is beyond me. This includes a stint fighting alongside the RAF in England).  This movie rates with \\"U-571\\" on an accuracy level.  It also does no justice to the two pilots Taylor and Welch (real guys who fought at Pearl Harbor) which is a real shame.
0143036742|5.0|An amazing novel. Starts off light and fun but really has a deep message. She is a great author and it's one of those novels you just don't want to put down.

B000002UAU|5.0|This album is nothing short of special. And one of its best qualities is how it sounds better every time you hear it. When I first bought it, I was rather disappointed. But after each listen, one just picks up more of the genius and fantastic song writing. I used to dislike A Day In the Life, but know its lyrics mesmerize me beyond belief. And the orchestral climax used to scare the crap out of me. It's simply amaizing!!! There is so much emotion in this album, that everyone should be able to relate to at least one song on this. My favorite changes from day to day depending on my mood. Even while I personally prefer Rvolver and Rubber Soul this is still the Beatles at their best.
0385338600|5.0|John Grisham is one of my all-time favorite authors. I can't believe how good his first novel actually was. I've seen the movie a dozen times, but I'm just now getting to the book, which was way better, if that's possible. The plot is so controversial, it's a wonder no one's written this kind of story before. Great job.  --from the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow.

B0002XMF5S|5.0|After the \\"Born Again\\" tour ended, Ian Gillan and Bev Bevan took off, leaving Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler yet again in a bad spot, needing to rebuild their band, Black Sabbath. An attemp was made in 84 with the return of Bill Ward, and new-comer vocalist David Donato, but that lasted only for a few photo shoots, and maybe a couple of rehearsals before falling apart. Then in 85 the original Black Sabbath reunited for \\"Live Aid\\", and there were rumors of them reuniting for good. Thank God that didn't happen!<br />Iommi and Butler branched off (or one could say that Butler left Sabbath, and that's the way I see it) to do solo projects. However, Sabbath still owed WB Records a 'Black Sabbath' record, plus WB execs, after hearing what Iommi had recorded with bassist Dave \\"The Beast\\" Spitz, drummer Eric Singer, and vocalist Glenn Hughes (one-time bassist/vocalist for Deep Purple), they urged Iommi to release it under the Black Sabbath name. Something that he would have been a fool not to have done! I've just always hated the 'featuring Tony Iommi' part under the Sabbath name. I really wish that could be blackened out. Plus, the cover could have been a LOT better by simply showing the desert and taking Iommi out of the cover photo. It was (and still is) a 'catch-22' situation: If it would have been released as a Tony Iommi solo album, critics and fans alike would have bashed it, calling it a Sabbath knock-off, and released as a Sabbath album, it was bashed as a solo album.<br />However, the album did pretty well, and Sabbath were born again yet again! Opeing with the fierce and heavy and fast \\"In For the Kill\\", they let you know from the get go they are back with a vengeance. The ballad \\"No Stranger To Love\\" reminds me a LOT of earlier Sabbath 'ballads' like \\"You Won't Change Me\\", \\"Changes\\", \\"Solitude\\", et al. Drummer Eric Singer should not only be credited for being one of the greatest drummers in rock (then unknown, stolen from the Lita Ford band, but to go on to working with the likes of Alice Cooper and KISS), but for introducing Sabbath fans to the double bass drum kit sound in the confines of Sabbath. Yes, Bill Ward had a double bass kit, but he was (and still is) a King of the Single Bass, as is Vinnie Appice. The already mentioned IFTK and \\"Turn To Stone\\" are solid rockers that are furthered along with Eric's mean kick a** drumming.<br />But, the real treat on this album (if those weren't good enough) are the very bluesy numbers \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\", \\"Angry Heart\\", \\"Danger Zone\\", and \\"In Memory\\" (and the already mentioned NSTL). This is the blues like only Iommi and Sabbath could play it (and remember, BS were a blues group from the outset). Very haunting riffs blended with Hughes' unique soulful blues voice just brings this album to life like never before.<br />And, if that's all NOT good enough, there is a real great mystic treat track on here! An instrumental called \\"Sphinx (The Guardian)\\" blends into the title track for the best Black Sabbath song since H&H and/or \\"Lonely Is the Word\\" from \\"Heaven And Hell\\".<br />Personally, I am SO glad that this was released as a Black Sabbath cd instead of an Iommi solo project, for if it had been released back then as an Iommi solo project, not only would it have been slammed for already said reasons, but it would have ended up in the same cut-out bins with Jimmy Page's \\"Outrider\\". Does anyone remember that one??? It was actually pretty good. Page should have taken a cue from Iommi and tried calling that a Zep record, and maybe it would still be talked about to this day like \\"Seventh Star\\" is...Then again, maybe not, because this has withstood the test of time because it is great music from a great band. And, this set live was phenominal! Even though Glenn was fired after only 5 days on the road and the AWESOME Ray Gillen was brought in to replace him, it was a great year for Sabbath live! So, if for only that, I am so glad this was released as a Sabbath album, for it helped keep them going on through the 90's. Thank you.the 90's. Thank you.

B000VBJEEG|3.0|Maintaining the status quo can be damaging to films, especially thanks to the highly popular animations that have graced the silver screen ([[ASIN:B00009ZYC1 SHREK]], [[ASIN:B00005JN4W THE INCREDIBLES]], [[ASIN:B000EQ5UHS HOODWINKED!]])Audiences get bored if all you show us is the same ol' same ol'. And this is where RATATOUILLE runs into trouble.<br /><br />Written and directed by Brad Bird (who also did The Incredibles and [[ASIN:B00009M9BK THE IRON GIANT]]), Mr. Bird has fallen into a small rut; one that I hope he doesn't remain in. Yes, the animation was great. Yes, the voices were wonderful. Yes, the story was cute and funny. But there was nothing new. We've seen these themes over and over and over again, and it's becoming a bit tiresome.<br /><br />Instead of a superhero family or a misunderstood ogre, this time we've got an English speaking French rat (don't ask) who's taste for expensive foods -- and not garbage -- gets him into trouble. Living the life of the dull and mundane with the rest of his extended family, Remy (Patton Oswalt, [[ASIN:B000TUL01E RENO 911!: MIAMI]]) soon has buckshot whizzing by all of his furry brethren. Removed from his familial upbringing, Remy turns quickly toward his love for rich foods. His astutely attuned nose leads him to Paris (as does a ghostly visitation from a world famous chef known as Gusteau voiced by Brad Garrett, [[ASIN:B00005JPE3 MUSIC AND LYRICS]]), where he finds a now corrupted and dying restaurant named after its formerly famous cook (the aforementioned Gusteau). He also runs into the newly hired garbage boy named (not funnily) Linguini (Lou Romano, [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 CARS]]). After being captured in the kitchen, Remy is caged and taken to the river by Linguini where he's told to dispose of the rodent in the nearby river. But Remy and Linguini soon realize they can understand one another, and Linguini can't bring himself to the kill the little fella. What does happen, though, is that a bizarre relationship builds and Linguini quickly becomes the soup chef thanks to Remy's ability to identify delectable food. Hidden under Linguini's hat (literally), rat and human become the master-blaster ([[ASIN:0790729342 ROAD WARRIOR]] reference) of Gusteau's restaurant.<br /><br />Swirling around this story is also a love interest between another chef named Collette (Janeane Garofalo) and Linguini, the battle between thievery and survival that Remy must address when his extended rat family pops in, and, of course, the battle that Linguini must do with a very Tim Burtonesque looking food critic named Anton Ego (the estimable Peter O'Toole, [[ASIN:B000EDWKXI CASANOVA]]).<br /><br />Not surprisingly, everything works out in the end thanks to human ingenuity and rodent accompaniment.<br /><br />But, again, this isn't something we haven't seen before. It's old terrain covered many times, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars. Had it not been for the awesome voice of Mr. O'Toole as the food critic, it may not have gotten even that.<br /><br />Kids will enjoy the action. Parents will like the familiar territory.

B00081U6EG|4.0|I bought this DVD only because of David Gilmour.  His live-performance of Marooned is completely outstanding!  I'll promise you, if you buy this, you will found yourself (just like I did) shaking your head thinking; is it possible to play like this? Well, it is for Mr David Gilmour anyway!  After Marooned, he played \\"Coming back to life\\"...played it good, although his voice in my opinion was a few percent below his usual standard.  Last song, Sorrow....also outstanding as usual!  Hank Marvin from The Shadows, also did a great job...especially Sleepwalk and Apache, Apache is just an incredible song!  And what can I say about Gary Moore? Well I think we all can agree that he knows how to play the guitar, and that he shows on Jimi Hendrix \\"Red House\\"!      Enjoy!
B00000GAIW|5.0|Jethro Tull's Aqualung album is a masterpiece in my opinion. Without a doubt. This was the first Tull record I ever had back in the 70s, and while Stand Up, Living in the Past, and also This Was are all very good albums, I don't think any other Tull (even Thick As A Brick) can top the 1971 Aqualung LP. The lyrics, the vocals, the guitar, the songs overall - the Aqualung album is outstanding in every way. Some of classic rock's best music period is found here. If you like hard rock, prog rock, the 1970s, lavish soundscapes, folk music, or lyrics with biting social commentary, this is a must-have CD. The way they match the uncomfortable riffs of the title track with the just outright ugly vocals and lyrics is amazing. The flute intro that builds to the main verse riff of Cross Eyed Mary blows me away every time. Mother Goose is one of the best \\"acoustic\\" rock songs ever recorded. The songs \\"Hym 43\\" and \\"Locomotive Breath\\" are as heavy as anything Black Sabbath ever did in their prime. I own one of the reissue versions that contains the 14+ minute interview with Ian, which is very interesting, and one of my favorite Tull songs not on the original Aqualung release, Song For Jeffery (the version on Living in the Past is better though). The sound quality on the Aqualung CD is very low - while with most CDs if my stereo is on \\"10\\" they're quite loud, I need to turn this one up to about 18 to reach the same volume levels, and the quietness is also due to a lot of dynamics in the music itself- light acoustic guitar into distortion-laden heavy guitar tones and back to soft flute, etc.    Jethro Tull's Aqualung is the only release in their discography I give 5 out of 5 stars to. Standout tracks: Aqualung, Cross Eyed Mary, Mother Goose, Up To Me, Hym 43, Locomotive Breath

So you can compare the situation and check if the director / actors create the scene as it was drown.<br />Story is quite simple, but it is simple as Batman or Spiderman or any other comics. It is the basics of comics, so focus on the creativity of the creators of the movie.
B000002UAR|5.0|I had never listened to a Beatle's album. I never chose to buy any and I never heard any songs (hits) that grabbed my attention enough to warrant my buying an album. I grew up to '70s music listening to Beatles' hits covered by artist after artist. As a result, they were almost cartoon-like, bubblegum in my mind. But I had a music theory teacher in college who extolled their virtues. I never paid attention. I was too busy listening and digging Bach, Schumann, Mozart, Stravinksy, Hindemith to care. I also had my small selection of '70s and '80s groups to adore. I am a major Elton John, Rickie Lee Jones, Dixie Dregs fan, so I never needed the Beatles music, nor understood their impact.    Since my brother got his iPod, he dispensed with a great deal of his CD collection which I inherited. And that is how I became aquainted with \\"Revolver.\\"     I knew that this was rated by some as the all-time greatest album. Since I am convinced that Beach Boys'\\"Pet Sounds\\" is the all-time greatest \\"rock\\" album, I wanted to prove myself right.     I began listening to \\"Revolver\\" these past few days. All I can say that after listening to the album 3 times, my eyes (ears) are opened.      This is nothing new to you Beatles fans. But now I do get what all the fuss is about. Absolutely brilliant songwriting, rhythms, playing, arrangements. It's amazing but when you actually listen to each song in the context of the entire album, it changes the listening experience entirely.    I can't say that it is better than \\"Pet Sounds\\" but I can now understand how it absolutely competes. I can't say enough and can't wait to listen to all the other albums now. \\"Tomorrow never knows\\" is an experience in itself and definitely scores with serious songwriting at any time any genre.

B000002UB3|3.0|As a child of the '70s, I am no expert on Beatle's music. I have only listened to two complete Beatles' albums ever. \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" and that is only 4-5 listens each in the last week - I am totally blown away. I can't get enough of either album.     This is my take as a newcomer into the world of Beatles' albums.    To me \\"Revolver\\" is razor sharp and a \\"thinking\\" album. Every track on \\"Revolver\\" is brilliantly conceived and executed.    Not so with \\"Abbey Road.\\" It is a free and \\"feeling\\" album. This album carries the listener on a journey. The listener gets immersed in the vibes - feelings created. The conception/execution is equally amazing; however it doesn't appear to be the focus - the result is that it is not as focused, condensed or and as sharp. But, it is soooo fun to listen to.    It is difficult to express, but even on first listen to \\"Abbey Road\\" I got the feeling that I became privy to some sacred discovery.     I love \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" \\"Polythene Pam\\" - the harmonies just take you wherever and I love that free-wheeling experience. Where is this going to go next?    \\"You never give your money/and Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight\\" all thematically alike are melodic, sensitive - yet never boring.    \\"I Want You\\" is a bit too long, but I love the bluesy passage in the middle.    \\"Because\\" is gorgeous.     \\"The End\\" is pure fun. Most of the rest is standard classic material we've all heard thousands of times.    Anyway I have heard so much about Sgt. Pepper and that is my next venture.    P.S. The 3 stars is a mistake. But system won't let me fix. I meant to give this 5 stars.
B000QXDEDG|1.0|I ordered 300 widescreen edition.  I didn't realize they sent me full screen until I started to watch the movie.  By then it's too late, I already opened it.  I really wanted to see the movie as soon as it arrived so I probably would've opened it anyway.  Sure wish I would have got what I ordered.  No more online movie shopping for me, i'll go to the store so I get what I want.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|The Firefly series and Serenity Movie really showed me what good sci-fi/fantasy can be. I used to be a real trek fan, but know i definitely think of myself as a browncoat. This is a show that deserves to be brought back! If you've heard about Firefly/Serenity, give it try. Buy the series first [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]], then this movie [[ASIN:B000Q9IZ5C Serenity (Collector's Edition)]], , you won't be disappointed!
0393316041|5.0|I find myself in the funny position of reviewing a book that I never thought enough of to list as a \\"favorite\\" or as \\"deep\\".  It's not a book I would normally bring up in a discussion of \\"life-changing\\" books.<br /><br />That's partly because this book defies categorization.  It's not a profound look at a genius; indeed we are given only glimpses into certain facets of Feynman's personality, with only hints of his darker sides.  It's not just a book of anecdotes.  There is an underlying message, as exemplified by the closing \\"Cargo Cult Science\\".  On the other hand, it's not trying to be a book with a lesson or moral.<br /><br />However, over time, this is a book I've read over and over again.  And it always seems fresh, as if I was reading it for the first time.  His exploits make me laugh, pause in thought, and inspire me to be curious about the world.  That's what draws me again and again to reread it.  I honestly think I've read it as many times as all my favorite books put together.  And I can't figure it out.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Wow, this was not what I was expecting!    The story was a lot slower than any Rocky film since the first one in the mid '70s, but I'm not complaining. When it was all over, I thought this was probably the best-made Rocky film of them all. I never thought I would describe a Rocky movie as \\"classy,\\" but this one deserves that adjective. It may be the least entertaining, as far as a lot of action goes, but it is the most classy.    I say this mainly for the wonderful, sweet tone to this story: a story of aging boxer who is long past his glory and is still mourning the loss of his wife. (Apparently \\"Adrian\\" died some time after the last Rocky film.) His wife's death is haunting him, which makes this a very sad film in the first 45 minutes. However, interspersed in Rocky's reflective period is the still the same upbeat, look-at-the-positive side-of-people attitude. It's obvious Rock still loves people. With that attitude, it's impossible to dislike the man.    For those who might be leery about watching yet another Rocky movie filled with over-the- top villains and way overdone ring action, rest easy: you won't see that here. Balboa's training scenes last only a few minutes and the fight doesn't begin until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. Preceding that are melodramatic moments with Rocky's friends, family, and new female friend and her son.....all handled with dignity and class.    The cinematography is just beautiful in parts and if you're a student of photography, you'll enjoy viewing this.    Sad, nostalgic, yet inspiring and optimistic, I can't recall ever being so impressed with a \\"Rocky\\" film. Highly recommended.

He must sort out his oedipal destiny.  Meanwhile, a Japanese oldster makes a parallel journey from Tokyo to the same town.  A mysterious incident during WWII left him scatterbrained, but with the ability to speak with cats.<br /><br />It just gets weirder and weirder from there.  I enjoyed the old guy's story especially.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|I had a huge advantage before watching this on DVD. I was told by a good friend that it was extremely slow, and be prepared to be bored out of \\"my mind.\\" Well, I wasn't bored, maybe because I now expected a slower, non-action-packed CIA-type film....and I wasn't disappointed. Actually, I liked it, mainly because of the cinematography. This is stunning in its photography. Kudos to Director Robert De Niro and Director of Photography Robert Richardson for their work in here.    I also appreciated the low profanity in here. After watching \\"The Departed,\\" this far-cleaner film was a treat for the ears, too. Yes, there are a handful of 'f-words,\\" but not much else including no blasphemy.    The story winds up presenting an interesting question which is posed to Matt Damon's character, \\"Edward Wilson.\\" He plays an extremely loyal CIA man, a guy who is straight-arrow and one whose priority is country-first. The dilemma occurs at the end when he must choose between what's best for his son or his country.     It's a thought-out, interesting story that takes a few sides to the left of center more than the right, but is not really a movie with any heavy-handed political agenda, mainly pointing out what it takes to be a successful \\"spy\\" and that this unemotional detachment can be rough on some people and their families.    This movie, I suspect, will either put you to sleep or fascinate you.

B00028HBKM|3.0|GOOD - Kudos for someone finally presenting an accurate account of Christ's sufferings, as gruesome and horrible as they were, although, if you read the Gospel accounts in the Bible, it was even worse than shown on this film. Jesus' face was beaten to a pulp and \\"unrecognizable\\" so keep that in mind if you think the film overdid the beatings. However, the overall effect is that there isn't anything sanitized in this film; it's an according-to-the-Book account and after you see this on film, it shakes you up.    I heard that people were so stunned they couldn't speak for about a half hour after coming out of the theaters. I thought that was probably exaggerated, but it wasn't. I felt the same way, just stunned at what I had witnessed. As a Believer, it was something I needed to see to remind me of what this God-in the flesh human voluntarily went through. For non-Believers, scoffers or whatever, I don't know what your reaction was to the film but for me, it was a humbling, sobering experience.    THE BAD - The unrelenting brutality against Jesus the last three-quarters of this film is so bad that, frankly, I would hesitate before ever watching this again. One viewing is enough. I am amazed so many people sat through this, including Christians. I wish director/producer Mel Gibson had shown more of Christ's resurrection instead of centering 99 percent of this movie on his suffering, although I understand Mel's point. However, all of Jesus' claims and sufferings are meaningless without the resurrection, so why not emphasize that instead of just tacking it on for the last minute or two? Just asking.    It's a cliché, but this is a film you won't soon forget, but I would add to that, one you probably won't want to watch multiple times.
B0000508U6|5.0|This album by Coldplay will go down in history as one of the greatest albums ever released.  Every song is beautiful, well written, meaningful and timeless. If you can only own one Coldplay album, this is it!    My favorite song is Everything's Not Lost.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This movie is a lot better than I had heard when it was first playing in the theaters.  National film critics weren't kind to it, but the public liked it. That's usually a good sign and it was in this case.  The movie is not only entertaining, it's one of the all-time great visual treats.      On Blu-Ray, it looks even more magnificent. It is just  stunning to look at from start-to-finish, on a regular DVD, too. That's what held my attention. Sure, I could tell the obvious computer-generated effects, but so what? This movie simply was fun to ogle, with all it's incredible scenery, outrageous monster-like characters and dramatic colors.    As for the story, I head read \\"it's just moronic mayhem, nothing but blood and guts and way overdone action.\\"    Not really.    I've seen a number of films with a lot more action than in here. When they did have it, unlike a lot of other films, the carnage didn't go on and on. It lasted a few minutes at most and broke for a lull. The only aspect I thought was sub-par was some of the dialog.    Whatever, this movie is worth seeing.
184195425X|4.0|I'm in the camp of those who loved this original, whimsical, memorable novel. The writing is beautiful, the main character endearing, the drama instense, the magical realism totally original, and play of ideas will keep me thinking for a long time.    (Caution, spoilers below)    But the \\"alternate ending\\" didn't work for me. It struck me as a TV soap-opera style gimmick that cheapened a lovely peice of magical realism. And it was so absurdly gruesome it seemed at least as unlikely as the animal story.     Other readers have told me they thought the author was giving us a choice between fantasy and realism. Doesn't work. The second story was as preposterous as the first (psychotic cooks, peeled faces, flying maternal heads? C'mon!) -- just less pleasant.     If the second story had seemed like a \\"real life\\" survival with humans, it would have worked wonderfully.      Oh well. Most of the book was brilliant.
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|THE GOOD - What a great start! The first half of this film is very good. It looks like, as advertised, that if you enjoyed the \\"Bourne\\" movies (\\"The Bourne Identity\\" and \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\") you should like this and that was the case with me.  Mark Walhber's \\"Bob Lee Swagger\\" is a likable hero, a good guy in every sense. The first half included an interesting study on what it takes to be a good \\"sniper.\\" It also had good photography.    The second half of this made me wonder, \\"Who wrote this script? Oliver Stone? Michael Moore? The DNC? I couldn't believe all the politics - all the Liberal conspiracies and the anti-Bush Administration comments - in the last hour of this movie. First, this extreme paranoid view that everyone in the government is corrupt is vastly overworked by Hollywood and this movie is the topper where they aren't even subtle about these theories.  They turn a decent action thriller into one big Left Wing propaganda piece. What a shame. And how about those action scenes? Fifty trained guys and an armed helicopter against \\"Rambo\\" in here and guess who wins?  Stupid......really stupid.    How a film can be so entertaining and somewhat intelligent and go down the dumper so fast and be so stupid in the second half is staggering.
0446528056|5.0|I loved this book! It was so much like my life that it was scary! I had to stop reading it when my boyfriend was shipped to Iraq because the first section of the book just hit home too much! but once I picked it up and read it again, it was the best book I have read in years! and I just love Nicholas Sparks! job well done! It did however, make me cry but it was still great! I highly reccomended for those who have ever been in a reltionship or are in a reltionship with someone in the military because you can feel it in your life! well at least I did!
B00005JPRT|5.0|Where to begin.  If this isn't the best movie of the summer, let alone the whole year, I don't know what movie is.  Please go see this movie so they will make more just like this.  The music is incredible, a little folk/pop that is just sensational.  The acting is perfect and the story is beautiful.  This should do wonderfully at the Oscars this year in the music catagories.  Unfortunately the movie will probably not get a bid for best movie or the actors either.  Too bad because it is truly a beautiful movie that deserves to be seen, and a soundtrack that deserves to be heard.  It's rare that a movie like this comes along, don't let it get away without seeing this gem.  I personally would like to thank the film makers and the actors for such an amazing gift to all of us, a job very very well done.  If I could, I'd give this movie 10 stars.  I LOVE THIS MOVIE.

B000VAPZM2|2.0|I loved the music and story from the first one so I was very excited to watch this one.     The story was good in the second one. It seemed to hold together, but I was very disappointed in the music. The songs were okay, but my problem was all the extra stuff they added to them.     In the first one if there was a solo, it was actually a solo, like when Vanessa was singing in the hallway, but in this one when Zac was singing on the golf course there was backup singers. There should not be backup singing when you are obviously standing by yourself in the middle of a golf course. Also there seeming to be a lot of computerized stuff added into all the songs which I hated. the first one was the cast using there voices to make the songs. this one you couldn't even hear them most of the time over all the other stuff.     I do not recommend this one if you want the music to be as good as the first one. If you don't care about the music and just want the story, then you'll probably be happy with it.
B0002XMF5S|4.0|Over the years, Seventh Star has, unfortunately, become an underrated album. I think the main reason being that it's not kind of a genuine Black Sabbath-sounding album. Yet, I remember how massively attracted to it I've become after the first listening. With Iommi's amazing riffs and Hughes' vocals, this album offers new listening pleasure and emphasizes Iommi's mastery and his ability to ride out difficult re-grouping conditions.
B000RG1DE4|5.0|Few albums truly live up to their titles and this one is truly full of rawness and power!  Think of the Ramones and the Sex Pistols but only much more raw and much, much more loud!  If you can even think further back, in tracks like \\"Shake Appeal\\" you'll hear heavy influences of Little Richard too.  It's a shame the man is so under-rated as if anyone is responsible for rock, punk and even metal music at least in influencing the genres from the very start, both Little Richard and Chuck Berry have got to be ranked number one and two respectively.  The album's not too long time-wise but I suppose that's okay because there's only so much raw power the average guy, myself included, can take at one sitting without wanting to go break something.  \\"Penetration\\" is the only track that sounds remotely like you could play it to your parents without them thinking you were completely flipped but overall, this is one great punk rock album that ranks up there with \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" as classics and standards of the genre.  Iggy's remastering has made it sound a lot more palatable without sacrificing any of the menace and edge of the original sound enough for anyone to seriously complain about it.  In my mind, this is the better-sounding version anyways.<br /><br />The remastering job is well done though which means the sound quality is very good considering the job was supervised by Iggy himself, we have the assurance that this is what the man himself would want us to hear. Now this version of the album comes in a very well designed mini-lp sleeve replica with good quality cardboard and fine detailed representation of the original lp sleeve down to the inner sleeve design too. It also includes a 16-page booklet printed on glossy paper which contains an excellent interview with Iggy himself done by Arthur Levy.  There is also a tiny square \\"Iggy Raw Power\\" sticker as well as an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  As far as mlps designs go, this one ranks among the best and I wish all mlps releases can be this good. Great packaging, great sound quality makes this great value as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of in-your-face punk and definitely worth the \\"upgrade\\"!g the best and I wish all mlps releases can be this good.

The words of Jodi Picoult were so accurate and they made me cry.  I think this book should be mandatory reading for teachers and parents at all levels. The mentality of \\"Kids will be kids\\" or \\"It has always been this way\\" is not acceptable.  People say, \\"There should be a manual when you become a parent.\\".

1582701709|1.0|This whole secret business is not a secret and it isn't new.  It reminds me of Calvinism and other religious notions like karma making one born into a lower caste of even the idea of original sin.  If it is true that we attract everything that comes to us, then not only did six million jews attract the holocaust to them but hundreds of millions of native americans--north and south, africans, asians, and polynesians sent an attraction out to europe and attracted white caucasians to come to their countries to rape them, give them diseases, kill them, steal their land and in some cases cause their whole tribe to die, every last member. Manifest Destiny?  So that means even the little babies were attracting this to themselves.  For what end?  Spiritual growth?  A spiritual shift--Yes, God wanted them to die so we could have their land, their riches, their future.  It had nothing to do with us.  We were simply acting according to what they and we attracted.  The secret is primarily a way for people (many of them white) to not have compassion, to feel smug and justified in their lives, because then they don't have to help anyone else.  Why bother?  If that person chose that experience, don't rob them of it and the lesson they \\"chose to learn\\" by feeding or clothing them or by helping them in any damn way.  They chose it.  The end. I actually heard new age women having a discussion once about why a woman they knew chose to be raped.  They were serious.  No compassion there.  They could have been holding her, supporting her, loving her, but instead they chose to wonder why she chose to be raped.  Shame on anyone who falls for this old age darkness.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I choose to love, to shine brightly, to attract good to myself but I know that someone else could overpower me and harm me and then I can choose how to react to that.  It has happened to me and I have chosen to confront those who harmed me and then to forgive, move on, and love myself no matter what.  It does not mean I chose that crap to happen.  It means I chose how to react and deal with it in a way that was best for me and others.  This secret may make you feel okay about being self-absorbed but it isn't going to heal the world.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I attended the Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA show (my 11th) which was held in the smallest venue on her tour, capacity 12,000.  This DVD + CD combo takes you there even more intimately without the $381 ticket.  This tour is Madonna's most ambitious one to date, which is saying a lot.  She hangs from a mirrored cross for Live to Tell, a 1986 classic.  She straddles and does sexy bad things to a carosel horse for Like A Virgin, perhaps her biggest hit of all time.  She takes us back to 1984-and takes it back to 1980-for Lucky Star, another early classic hit.  But it's her most recent record, Confessions on a Dance Floor, that get's most of Madonna's attention.  And she wants you to be with her on her current quest for global domination of the pop kingdom.  Therefore we are treated to instant classics such as the Hung Up closer of the show and see her humping a boom box.  What should have been a hit single Jump with its frenetic dancers.  And Sorry with its roller boogie influences.  For me, the best moment in the show, this DVD and the CD however is EROTICA / YOU THRILL ME.  She takes her hit from 1992 (backlash and all) and re-invents it into a haunting, melancholy, danceable version.      I would enthusiastically recommend this.  Eventhough Madonna doesn't hit the charts in the US like she used to, and should still, her \\"art\\" or \\"product\\" if you will (herself), she has never be better.  She is in tip top shape and at the top of her game with excellent songs and yet ANOTHER INCREDIBLE WORLD TOUR........Next tour Madonna should go to cities she hasn't been to ever or at least in a while....Atlanta, DC, Charlotte, Greensboro.....

1400063515|5.0|2007 Random House, 396 pages (of which 305 pages for main body of book)    The Black Swan is a very unusual book. A couple of days after finishing it I still feel like I'm struggling to integrate its message with life. It reminds me a little of Richard Dawkins' Selfish Gene in that respect: its central thesis, which appears to be unassailably argued, indicates that the standard view of the world is wrong. In Dawkins' case, the primacy of the individual (as opposed to the gene) and in Taleb's case, the view that the world is essentially driven by normal, day-to-day events.    The subtitle of Taleb's book tells you what it is about: The Impact of the Highly Improbable. According to Taleb, high-impact rare events ('Black Swans') are not anything like as rare as we think they are and their effect is so disproportionately large that they effectively drive events in the world.    This may not sound all that provocative, but Taleb's argument is that virtually everybody's view of the world as essentially linear and step-by-step is just an illusion that protects us from understanding that our progress through life is much more random and fragile than we think.    Taleb's outstanding first book, Fooled by Randomness, is about the much greater role of luck in life than is commonly understood. The Black Swan develops this thesis further and shows that rare and unexpected events (what you might think of as a subdivision of luck) drive much of the results in the world.     Since reading Richard Koch's The 80/20 Principle eight or so years ago - after which I began to look at the world through the lens of unequal cause and effect - I have been coming gradually around to Taleb's views. Even so, The Black Swan is difficult to assimilate - and it must seem extremely odd (and itself most improbable) to those who have not had some preparation.    One can see this difficulty in the absolute refusal of modern academic finance to give up theories of how the world works (the bell curve orpattern of 'normal' distribution) that allow them to use complicated mathematics and which are just plain wrong. Taleb thought the Long Term Capital Management debacle in 1998 - in which various Nobel-winning economists proved their (Nobel-winning) ideas did not apply in the real world - would be the end of these dangerously wrong beliefs.     However, it was Taleb who was wrong about that: a whole gang of academics who have invested a good chunk of their lives in an idea that turns out to be worthless (actually significantly negative) won't give it up easily (and perhaps not until they are all dead). The sub-prime mess, with accompanying cries of surprise and of '25-standard deviation events' from various hog-greedy financiers and hedge fund managers, shows the continued prevalence of these appalling ideas.    After the success of Fooled by Randomness, it would appear that Taleb had more freedom to write (and be published) however he wanted. It makes The Black Swan more idiosyncratic and aggressive than Fooled by Randomness. I imagine this will act as a polariser and some people who would otherwise appreciate the content may not like the delivery. Personally, though, I loved it.     As someone who has tried working in various jobs in the City of London (the UK equivalent of Wall Street) I feel in some ways that Taleb is a kindred spirit: I can't stand arrogant, ignorant 'empty suits' either. I thought his \\"Get Another Job\\" section (p. 163) was perfect:    \\"There are those people who produce forecasts uncritically. When asked why they forecast, they answer, \\"Well, that's what we're paid to do here.\\"  My suggestion: get another job.  This suggestion is not too demanding: unless you are a slave, I assume you have some amount of control over your job selection. Otherwise this becomes a problem of ethics, and a grave one at that. People who are trapped in their jobs who forecast simply because \\"that's my job,\\" knowing pretty well that their forecast is ineffectual, arenot what I would call ethical. What they do is no different from repeating lies simply because \\"it's my job.\\"\\"    Taleb's very severe and aggressive criticism of risk measurement techniques in modern finance could be interpreted as an intemperate rant. I don't subscribe to this view and suspect Taleb chose this approach deliberately in order to make it clear that the prevalent financial risk management techniques and his ideas cannot in any way coexist: they are absolutely and totally mutually exclusive. (Taleb mentions that after finding it impossible to refute his ideas some people then try to combine them with their old ways of operating.)     I also liked the way Taleb approached and structured his book: he uses stories to get ideas across (as with Nero Tulip in Fooled by Randomness) and has separated his book into sections that allow one to understand his ideas with or without the scientific underlay (I think this is a great idea).     Some people (whether wilfully or not) confused the central theme of Fooled by Randomness, that much of life is driven by luck, with the superficially similar but totally different 'all of life is driven by luck'. In a similar way, I believe some people think that Taleb's message in The Black Swan is unremittingly negative: that we are all permanently exposed to large unexpected events that can wreck all our plans in an instant, and which we can do nothing about.    Taleb's point is rather that most specific forecasting is pointless, as large, rare and unexpected events (which by definition could not have been included in the forecast) will render the forecast useless. However, as Black Swans can be both negative and positive, we can try to structure our lives in order to minimise the effect of the negative Black Swans and maximise the impact of the positive ones.     I think this is excellent advice on how to live one's life and seems to be equivalent, for example, to the focus on downside protection (rather than upside potential) that has led to the success of the 'value' approach to investing. Highly recommended.
B000069KGM|5.0|THE BAND: Terry Kath (guitar, vocals), Peter Cetera (bass, vocals), Robert Lamm (keyboards, vocals), Lee Loughnane (trumpet, background vocals), James Pankow (trombone), Walter Parazaider (saxophone, woodwinds, background vocals), Danny Seraphine (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1969) 12 tracks clocking in at approximately 76 minutes. Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet containing song titles/credits, a 6-page intro from Rolling Stone editor Dave Wild, album artwork and photos. Originally on the Columbia Records label, this 2002 remastered edition is on Rhino/Warner.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Chicago's first album is still an amazing piece of work to me. So much so, that I put it in the same ranks as Jimi Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced\\" and The Beatles \\"Sgt Pepper\\" - in that the sound of the album was completely original and something the listener had never quite heard before. Rock, with an amazing horn section. At the time, guitars were always at the forefront in the world of rock music. Chicago had some great guitars (thanks to the underrated Kath, R.I.P.), but on many of the songs, the guitars took a back seat to the tremendous brass horns. For me, Kath's brilliance really shines on the non-hits \\"Poem 58\\", \\"Listen\\", \\"Free Form Guitar\\" and \\"South California Purples\\". Three major hits (all written by Lamm) would make it to most future Chicago compilations - one of their best ever tunes \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", \\"Beginnings\\" and \\"Questions 67 & 68\\". Chicago fused rock with pop, jazz and free-form play. Chicago also boasted 3 competent singers in Lamm, Kath and Cetera. A great album - outstanding songs and extremely polished for a band's debut (not to mention this was originally a double album on vinyl - a gutsy introduction). Though the sound production is somewhat dated (1960's technology), the remastering absolutely helps. Cetera's bass guitar thunders on \\"Beginnings\\", and the horn section throughout sounds crisp. *Bits & Pieces: Legal action by the actual Chicago Transit Authority made the band change the name to \\"Chicago\\" after this album was released. The album reached #17 on the Billboard charts (though no hits were released at the time... 3 tracks released belated in '70 and '71) and stayed on the charts for 171 weeks. A timeless classic.

B000Q79HS8|5.0|If you like action then this is a great movie. You should watch the Bourne Idenity first for context.
B000IJ79V6|4.0|Superman does it again with this sequel, which truly is a great sequel indeed. What makes the movie is the three villains, especially Zod. In this movie, Superman almost meets his match when three fellow Kryptonians arrive on Earth bent on conquest. There are a lot of scenes in this movie that are very memorable. From the big battle in Metropolis to the strange plastic \\"S\\" that Superman uses from his chest.<br /><br />I give this movie four stars, probably more like four and a half. I just don't think that this film had as much emotion as the original movie. In the first movie, you felt for Superman when he has to go back in time (which I won't give away why). This movie is way different than the Donner version of the film, so buy both if you want to see the difference. This movie is the canon version, especially with the new \\"Superman Returns\\" storyline. Overall great film, but a little less than the first movie
B000R7GKQE|5.0|id like to 1st start off by saying the obvious; the negative feedback for the show: for those of you that might look at the show & think: ooohhhkay its a modern day revised made for adolescence tv show, ghostbusters. this is what some people would think, c'mon lets get real how good can it be & how long can it last. not looking to give it a shot. & given the synopsis of the series, the competition, on all networks, so many questions where is the show going?? there are so many movies that were made before this series came out that it just looks like they had the expressed written permission to remake them for tv. that alone is probably what turned alot of people off to the show. but this is where all the positive feedback: out weighs the bad.  2 main characters dean & sam, 3 if you count the '67 395 chevy impala, AWESOME CAR!! this show delivers everything you cant simply catagorize it under horror/sci-fi/paranormal- thats 3 not one...& dont forget it has story lines, twists, comedy, action, adventure, something for the women 2 guys i know would never kick out of bed, theyre eye candy for the ladies, where theyd fall heavy for sam the sensitive of the 2, dean the strong silent type. but both strong enough characters for guys to be like these characters remind me of my closest of friends. if not feel compelled both characters remind them of themselves. the person who you are & the person you wish youd want to be. its a great show great cast great writers & jensen & jared work so well together that if this show ever got cancelled they oughtta create a new series where theyre both in it these 2 actors MAKE THE SCRIPT, the script doesnt make the actors. JENSEN & JARED JUUUUST J-ELLLL SO WELL. THEIR ACTING JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER & BETTER. i just wish i could get a chance at writing for the show. an episode at least, & hope to get to see my name in the credits.  Lou ~ from the Bronx New York
B00004YZFR|5.0|There are two distinct parts to this great film, the first  a standard rockumentary (and a good one at that) that focuses on the Rolling Stones and their recording and performing in the U.S in late 1969.    Fans of the Stones will love to see this band  at the peak of their youth,influence and talent. Mick Taylor had just replaced the deceased Brian Jones bringing a far more professional guitar sound to the band. Taylor was a true musician, arguably the best axeman the Stones ever had. Mick Taylor's lead guitar runs brought so much to the band as their most acclaimed albums \\"Let it Bleed\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street\\" followed.The Stones are featured here live at Madison Square Garden with opening act Ike and (a very young and sexy) Tina Turner.    The second (and much more important) part of this film focuses on the Stones disasterous free concert at the Altamont Motor Speedway in Northern California. The real life crowd footage of this show is a fascinating look into the naivetee, the mind pollution of hard drugs and the loss of innocence and direction of the 60's Generation. The hippies at this show make \\"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\\" look like a Mensa festival- stoned on acid, irrational- these are the folks who think war machines can be stopped with peaceful vibes and flowers. And when minor situations erupt that could be handled more tactfully, the Hell's Angels security detail began to get rough with the overintoxicated and clueless concert goers.Very interesting is the interaction within the crowd as the mood starts to go bad.     Opening act the Flying Burrito Brothers attempt the old classic \\"6 Days on the Road\\" and have to deal with crowd violence. The Jefferson Airplane, also in their musical prime suffer the same fate.But headliners the Rolling Stones insist on going on with the show.    It's very interesting to see human weakness from all sides, the Hell's Angels clearly overreacting with fists and clubs to annoying stoned out fans is a lackof judgement with brutal consequence. More interesting is the impotence of the performers- a scared Keith Richard patting the back of the biggest nearby bodyguard, Paul Kantner shivering behind a microphone and attempting to use the crowd to shame the outlaw bikers, Mick Jagger trying to dance and ignore the mayhem around him while fans look on disgustedly. These are the ROCK STARS who thought they could preach peace and all would accept their gospel.  To see these revered musicians appear so human and vulernable is worth the price of admission.The images that are captured are incredible, thousands of words cannot describe what cameras were lucky enough to catch.    There is debate on what happened to Meredith Hunter, an 18 year old who is seen with a handgun at the concert and then stabbed to death by the Hell's Angels. After watching fat naked hippies battered with pool cues, it is hard to defend anything the Angels did that day, but a jury acquitted several of the bikers of murder and YES  unfortunately this young man did brandish a pistol at a rock concert, hardly a \\"peace and love\\" thing to do. The only thing undebatable is that this was a tragedy and a waste of life. Watch the movie and decide for yourself.    Great music, tense and chilling, It is sad that this was a real event but very fascinating viewing for most anyone, rock fans or those with historical interest for the era.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I smiled, I laughed and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! (I must be a closet romantic.) \\"Love Actually\\" runs the gamut of love stories by having several different love stories running at the same time. Each one is enjoyable. What I enjoyed the most was spotting each plot in the other stories and how they each were woven into the whole.    The DVD extras and commentary are also entertaining if you're interested in seeing how the director thinks and how each story line develops.    I won't spoil it for you, but it you're looking for a fun movie that you can watch again and again, this is it.
B000BI0WOA|4.0|A great first disc, the second is junked up with a bunch of Mark Knopfler duds, and there's some songs omitted that I would have considered mandatory Dire Straits inclusions (\\"Water of Love\\", \\"Expresso Love\\", \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\", \\"Industrial Disease\\", and \\"Lady Writer\\") It's not that many original Dire Straits albums - while you're sure to be happy with disc one, wouldn't you be happier with a complete set of Dire Straits original albums instead?
B000GPIPSS|5.0|The 75th Edition has two movies.  The English version with Bela Lugosi that we all know about. And the Spanish version.  While the 2 disc set has tons of extras I wish to focus on the films.<br />The English version and the Spanish version were both made using the same script and props and setting but after that they seem to go their own ways.  You see, the English movie was made during the day and than the Spanish crew and actors came in, and filmed theirs in the evening. But they were able to watch the dailies from the English version and say to themselves, we can do better than that.<br />I am going to go out on a limb and say the Spanish movie is slightly better.  The acting and camera work has more energy.  The Spanish actresses are sexier, which is important when you're dealing with a vampire story, and the English version feels like a silent film much of the time.<br />While I think Bela Lugosi did a great job I feel that the rest of the crew, the director and the caste of the English version were not up to the mission of bringing Dracula to the big screen.  I have to declare the Spanish one the best Dracula film brought to the big screen so far.
B00004Z459|5.0|Dynamite of the kind played with by Blood, Sweat, and Tears, Chicago, and Earth, Wind, and Fire, only using a more modern genre (Rap? Hip Hop?) mixed with Rock.  I see it as Rap from a Rock direction, as opposed to Rage Against the Machine, which is Rock from Rap direction.      It just goes to show that some of the best music ever made is being made today, albeit in smaller quantities that the '70's.  With original albuns this great, there will be no need for a \\"Greatest Hits\\".  More consistent highest quality from start to finish than nearly any album I have before it.  You know, stuff like Boston's \\"Boston\\", Queen's \\"A Day at the Races\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"III\\".
1573301183|5.0|MTV Unplugged (1996.), an Alice In Chains concert DVD<br /><br />Alice In Chains' relatively short career (in terms of album releases) was a fantastically productive one. For me, they were much more than just a metal band or indeed a band that was pulled under the `grunge' moniker. Their three album releases and two EPs displayed both the bands ability as a heavy metal outfit but also one who added lots of acoustics and atmospherics to their music. Following the band's self-titled and final album release in 1995, they remained pretty low-key and out of the public eye. Then, a year later came along a concert to be remembered down as Alice In Chains took their turn to do an MTV unplugged set.<br /><br />Theres something very unique about Alice In Chains' performance on this CD/DVD. The concert conveys so much. There's excellent musicianship and great chemistry between the band and there is also Layne Staley's performance, a voice sounding so tortured yet powerful. The band's performance is inspirational, yet there is an underlying feeling of tragedy and uncertainty to it. Layne Staley is clearly high on drugs during the performance, an addiction which would sadly lead to his unfortunate death in 2002. His performance is excellent, give or take the amusing moment where he forgets the lyrics during `Sludge Factory' but as many have said it is a tragic thing to see, especially now as we know how much more Layne would deteriorate in the following five years. The atmosphere is perfect on this concert DVD; a slightly gloomy but candle-lit setting and a great audience who are all clearly relishing this timeless gig. The band play a killer 13 song set that acts as a great snapshot of their overall career. There's a good mix of the acoustic stuff as seen on `Jar Of Flies' but there is also plenty of the heavier stuff masterfully set to an acoustic set. Theres sadly no tracks from Facelift (an acoustic take on `Man In The Box' would have been interesting) but it doesn't detract from the overall set.<br /><br />The emotive and powerful `Nutshell' makes an excellent opener and follow ups `Brother' and `No Excuses' fully display AIC's acoustic set ability to the full. `Sludge Factory', a track that sounds heavy and warped on the original album release is an concert highlight. It always amazes me how good this song sounds acoustically. True, the band cut the song to 4 minutes as the weird outro to the song would be too difficult to carry out on an acoustic. The meat of the song sounds great however and just as crunching acoustically as it does on electric. Cantrell's chorus guitar melody sounds especially awesome. `Down In A Hole' and `Angry Chair' both translate brilliantly into this set a lead us up to the band's definitive `Rooster' which is a purely heart wrenching and powerful song. `Got Me Wrong' keeps that uncertain AIC musical feel to the music before another one of their semi-acoustic classics `Heaven Beside You' adds more great melody to the performance. `Would?', always a powerful yet ambiguous song keeps the band in full flow; the bass sounds great here. `Frogs' and `Over Now' are two atmospheric follow ups that do the album versions true justice live. `Frogs' is a chilling listen as usual. `The Killer Is Me' is a classic way for AIC to finish in true off-kilter, warped and unnerving fashion.<br /><br />The MTV Unplugged DVD for Alice In Chains captures the band as their true selves, giving a timeless performance. This is a concert of pure emotion, atmosphere and heartache with many classic Alice In Chains songs to hear. It is also a sad yet fitting finale for Layne Staley. He is clearly in a bad state by the stage of this concert but it doesn't stop him giving one of his great performances and one which will be remembered for many years to come. This DVD (I recommend the DVD version over the CD for all of you who are viewing the CD product page) is a must for any AIC fan or anyone who appreciates grunge in general. This is one ofthe great concert DVD's, highly recommended!<br /><br />R.I.P. Layne Staley<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10y recommended!    R.I.P. Layne Staley    MY RATING: 9/10
0515141429|3.0|While on a cruise recently I started talking books and authors (especially mysteries) with an Englishwoman who I met one day at the breakfast table. When I mentioned I am a Michael Connelly fan, she suggested Lee Childs. Having heard his name before, I gave him a try. Always on the lookout for a new series, I picked The Killing Floor, the first installment of the Jack Reacher books.<br /><br />Having finished this book, I am impressed with Lee Childs' writing ability potential. It hits the ground running with Jack Reacher, a military police officer, who recently left the service to wander about the country in a hobo-like existence. When a brutal murder is committed in a small Southern town, Reacher finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, hauled into the police station, and then thrown into jail despite what (as the reader knows) his obvious innocence. Things are harrowing there for a while, but he does get out and then puts his experience into action as he joins in on the investigation,  finds a romantic interest too and continues his adventures. Jack Reacher is a very unique, interesting, and promising character with a macho, loner, wise-guy, and cerebral persona that always does well in the mystery genre. Terrible things are happening in this town and who is on the good or bad side keeps the reader guessing.<br /><br />At this point, Childs was off to a great start and I was excited to have found a winner. Unfortunately, this five-star setup does not live up to its promise. As many others reviews have stated, The Killing Floor is full of plot holes, situations, relationships that are not credible, and incomplete character development. These flaws multiply and accelerate as the plot moves on to its conclusion and I felt as if I was being led by the nose and manipulated.  However, my time with The Killing Floor was not wasted. Despite all my criticism, I did enjoy it and intend to read the next installment of the Jack Reacher series. Although full of annoyances, The Killing Floor has a spark that may turn into a great series for me. This review has gone on far longer than I originally intended and I find it difficult to find concluding words. I will simply leave it by stating that The Killing Floor was a book that I could not stop enjoying despite its many flaws.lling Floor has a spark that may turn into a great series for me.

B0000CFW87|5.0|Amazing album, mixing the pop hits we've grown to know and love with the songs song in foreign languages which bring you tears without even knowing why.  His voice is straight from the heavens.
B0000667RO|3.0|Bryan Adams is everything you would expect but I learned, once again, that buying a used CD can be risky.  In three out of four players, only the first two tracks play.  That is less than ideal but that is what happens when you try to save a few bucks.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Well, I finally broke down and decided that I'd better see this movie so that I could at least discuss the movie, if not global warming in general, with people I come in contact with on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />It was certainly more watchable than I thought it would be.  Not bad for a lecture and a slide show converted into a move.<br /><br />Still, there was something unsettling about the overall ambience or style of the movie, and that is this continual alteration between Gore at his slideshow in front of enrapt college students and these sentimental and emotionally manipulative cut away scenes where Gore is speaking in his soft and low voice, as if to me personally, about some experience in his life where he had an epiphany of some sort.  The most egregious being the incident where his son almost died in a traffic accident.<br /><br />Now, as a parent of two small boys I can understand how this would feel, and I sure wouln't wish something like this on anyone, but it seemed an over-the-top appeal to emotions in a movie that I thought was going to be a documentary with an emphasis on science and evidence.<br /><br />In fact, so much of this movie was like a campaign commercial for Al Gore.  Was the purpose of the movie to convince me to do something about global warming, or was it to make me unquestioningly loyal to Al Gore?  It seemed a little of each.<br /><br />Now for some particulars I found myself wondering about:<br /><br />1.  Al Gore's teacher who was ignorant of contenantal drift when Al was in sixth grade.  Wouldn't that be about 1959?  Gore said something to the effect that this is where science was at the time, but actually continal drift had been researched and vigerous debates had occured in the scientific community back in the 1920's.  I'm very sure the scientific community, if not Gore's ignorant teacher, accepted continental movement by the time Gore was in the sixth grade.<br /><br />2.  People who believe that the Earth is so big that man cannot possibly have an impact on the environment?  The only person I've ever heard say something like that was Rush Limbaugh.  I was around for the first Earth Day and I remember the \\"deposit litter\\" campaigns of the 60's.  This seemed like a straw man just for the purpose of knocking down.<br /><br />3.  \\"It's not political; it's moral\\"  Well, I guess you can legislate morality after all.  Ha ha.<br /><br />4.  Too much capitalizing on hurricane Katrina.  That was cheap and too easy and intended to appeal to emotions.  Big storms have been happening for a long time, as the quote from Winston Churchill proved.<br /><br />5.  Al Gore walking through the airport with his luggage.  Yup, he flies coach just like the rest of us.  Of course, we don't see him actually sit down on the plane.<br /><br />6.  This whole idea that every real scientist agrees that man is responsible for global warming.  A search on this site in books will disprove that quick enough.<br /><br />7.  The only way Al Gore knows how to get his message across is city by city, person by person.  Savor the irony of hearing that in a massively hyped movie.<br /><br />8.  \\"We worked together in a completely bipartisan way to bring down communism\\".  I lived through much of the cold war, and I missed the bipartisan part.  Shoud've payed more attention I guess.<br /><br />9.  I can bring my individual carbon emmissions to zero?  When?  When I'm dead!  I'll stop breathing!  It's comforting to know that someday I, and all you reading this, will bring our carbon emmissions to zero.<br /><br />Well, I believe in global warming, but I'm not totally convinced as to what should be done about it.  I think we need an approach to spreading the message that's a little more inclusive than the old cliche of demonizing republicans and oil companies, but I'm sure that with millions of twenty-something non-conformists all thinking and talking the same way about the issue it's sure to be solved in my lifetime anyway.<br /><br />Or, maybe I should just move to higher ground.
B000SMWUPS|3.0|I have a Maclaren Triumph that I really like but wished it had cupholders... this organizer does the trick.  You do have to put it on and take it off each time you use it since the stroller won't fold with it attached but its worth it to have somewhere to throw your keys and cell phone.  I will say this... since its not attached permanently it does move a bit so bottled water with the cap on is your best bet as far as a beverage goes, or a soda bottle with a cap.  An open can of soda sloshed around a bit while walking.
B00000JY1X|5.0|i am the 129th person to review this, or at least i'm pretty sure i'm #129, and the 3 disc set is already approaching 100% approval.  Here is all i have to say.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.   Stephin's music is beautiful and the lyrics are untouchable as well.  if you've never heard it, i highly suggest buying it sight unheard and blindly accepting you made a good decision.  it may take a few listens to get the full grasp of what it's all about, but when you do you will be hooked.  welcome to stephin's world...you won't regret it.

1594489505|5.0|I am always a tiny bit leery of books written by men that attempt to fully express a woman's perspective (or vice versa), but Hosseini has written a beautiful, upsetting, frustrating, touching, and on and on novel that captures much complexity.  Much like the Kite Runner, I was fascinated with the depictions of living in Afghanistan before and after the Taliban.  I was also interested in how the women's different perspectives impacted their experiences, expectations, and ultimately, their destinies.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|This movie doesnt even closely resemble reality in the Marine Corps.   It brings dishonor to his service as a MARINE.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|The sweeping shots of mountains are at first awe-inspiring, then soon start to resemble something from a National Geographic special.     There's a lot of \\"The Ugly American\\" message in the story (as if there aren't any poor people in America), and the message is delivered in a very heavy-handed, bludgeoning way.     Brad Pitt phones this one in. There's nothing really memorable here; there's no humor to lighten the heavy plot.    \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a much better film. Rent that instead.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|This would be a good movie IF it were not called X-Men. They have completely sabotaged the X-Men storyline from the comics. They came up with new stories, which is sometimes ok, but not here. Jean Grey is barely used, Storm looks weak and undecisive, and Scott, why did they even have him there? THe movie left too many things unexplained, changed the X-men Universe and forgot to give some depth to the characters. This is just an action film and only that. Only Wolverine saves the day and the movie.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Celebrity Skin. For me, (and most people who know me would never suspect that I ever listened to this much less own it, but I do,) is a very good commercial Rock Album, with songs from a woman who had finally grown up, but still alienated.<br /><br />The tunesmithing, vocals and musicianship, all show a huge amount of maturity over earlier outings for Hole, and this remains my favorite, as I have to be in the right mood to appreciate the older stuff, but I still do, albeit rarely.<br /><br />It is too bad (to me) that the flack Ms. Love received as being a sell out for making a more mature and more commercial CD resulted in her going back to the teen-age anger by the time \\"America's Sweetheart\\" came out, which just comes across as an angry middle aged woman who doesn't get it. But here in \\"Celebrity Skin\\" the raw emotions are tempered with well crafted music, and ironically pretty vocals.<br /><br />I hope that one day Ms. Love may grow up for good and all and make this kind of album again.<br /><br />But that's just me
B000N3T0DW|4.0|Memorable lines, memorable characters and a certain magic only Almod&oacute;var can bring...This is a great movie in the true style of Almod&oacute;var films. Pen&eacute;lope Cruz powerfully acts the character of Raimunda and shines doing so. This powerful cast of women act with the poignant entonation that is reminiscent of theater (with their strong and paused acting perfectly queued to deliver the perfect lines) but with the allure and aesthetics of film. The actress that played the daughter is not as good though: a little bland or jaded. This is defiantely a movie to see.
B000TSIK14|5.0|I can't stop listening. Sure, I'm biased. The Scorps are my favorite band, without question. That said, I thought the \\"return to our roots\\" Unbreakable album fell a little short. Hour 1 hits the mark. I can respect the Desmond Child haters, but I think some of them are discounting this album just because his name is attached to it. A band like the Scorpions isn't going to let Desmond Child, or anyone else, change their sound or overproduce their songs. That said, you can tell someone (Child) was behind the glass working these songs. But that's not a bad thing. Everything you expect from a 2007 Scorps album is here. Sure, it's not Lovedrive or Blackout or LAFS, but it is great new material. Klaus is at the top of his game as usual. Matthias shreds, something he hasn't done since Face the Heat (with the exception of the Borderline solo on Unbreakable). Rudolph's rhythm sections draw you in. And Kottak's drumming has become a real strength in the post-Rarebell era. And the love songs get a little sappy ... in an appealing way that only these guys can pull off. If you're thinking about buying this album, think no more.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Absolutely great series of videos.  I purchased it initially for my wife and I and then another copy for my grand children. The videos are unquestionably good enough for use in schools at virtually any level from elementary to college.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|What a great partnership these two have.  He sounds like Cat Stevens and she sounds like an Angel.  I bought the soundtrack to \\"Once\\" as well.
B00062ZE3U|2.0|I'm a big fan of WT's \\"Mother Earth\\" era. Some of it might be considered outlandish, but if the music doesn't appeal to you it doesn't mean it is worse quality than Silent Force, their more well-known album. We can see this evident in trends; popularity doesn't have anything to do with quality.     Sharon and the band carried their style with eccentricity and originality, so much so that when Evanescence first appeared on the American music scene... some years after Within Temptain had been rockin' the dutch metal scene, I thought -they- were ripping on Sharon and WT's style visually. At least their singing was watered down and predictable enough not to be comparable to Sharon's originality in the vocal department.    Then, ironically, Within Temptation began sounding eerily like Evanescence. I was disappointed.     Silent Force and the subsequent releases are more pop oriented and aimed at an American fan base. It is a product, designed to be more accessible to the masses in order to generate more record sales.     Excuse the references if they are over done, but I find that Within Temptation's more-accessible albums like The Silent Force and The Heart of Everything lack the creativity and originality once present in their music. If you want music that is very melodic, easy to listen to, and can still somehow be called 'metal' in any way, choke down this angst-ridden copy cat of a copy cat CD.    If you want power and quirky uniqueness with an eco-spin, try for Mother Earth.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|This CD could have been much better (i believe). It is pretty raw and heavy, but lacks hooks that stick and some melodic moments.<br />I like it, but dont see myself playing it a lot. Siamease Dream 2 it is NOT! But it is a decent rock CD. Just not what you would expect after such a long hiatus. The songs just dont sound finished.
032147404X|1.0|The writing style in this book is incredibly distracting and irritating, especially for non-american readers. It begins with 2 pages of gushing thanks to God, Jesus, the author's lovely wife, the author's lovely children, etc, then continues with about 5 pages of absolute drivel in a failed attempt to establish a jokey rapport with the reader. Then finally we get a couple of pages of technical photographic advice, then that's Chapter 1. Chapter 2 starts with more jokey stuff, and so on. I was ready to burn the book by Chapter 3.    The plan for the book is a nice concept: one photographic tip per page. While this makes it very digestible, unfortunately the small page size and the large font mean that each page carries very little information, so the text is superficial and disjointed.    I have read a lot of photography how-to books, and this one did not contain anything new to me. I found most of the technical tips far too basic, too general and sometimes incorrect or oversimplified.  On the other hand, I think a beginner in photography would find this book bewildering because there is insufficient detail.     I would recommend [[ASIN:0789496372 The New Manual of Photography]] over this book in all respects.
B000069HJL|3.0|Personally I like when a band uses the live version to make variations on the theme. But listening to PARIS is like listen to the studio recording versions. No jamming no variation. I am a little bit disappoint it about the album. Great songs like School are a perfect replica of the studio version I was expecting that the solo piano will fly a little bit more but no.<br />For those who don't like variations in songs this is a great CD.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This has been a year for pausing at the passing of too many fine artists and now the world weeps for the Big Man Luciano Pavarotti.  Many eulogies have been written in the media about the life and career of the King of High Cs, but not seeing one on [...] prompts this comment on one of the finer opera recordings of the past century, a recording that captured Pavarotti at his finest in his special moment with the aria he has made famous - 'Nessun dorma'.  Assuming the role of the Calaf in TURANDOT seemed a natural for Pavarotti, a man of large dimensions not only in girth but also in his reciprocal love for his adoring audience.  He is joined by Dame Joan Sutherland in the title role, Montserrat Caball&eacute; as Liu, and such fine artists as Pier Francesco Poli, Tom Krause, Nicolai Ghiaurov, and Peter Pears in this dream cast.  Confining the experience to simply an aural one in this case works for the better: the acting on a real stage with this cast would likely be minimal.<br />Zubin Mehta conducts the London Philharmonic Orchestra with both propulsive energy and the gentlest of mysterious backgrounds.  He obviously understands the gifts of each of the stars and serves as the model accompanist.  Each of the three main roles is sung well, but the recording has the highlight of Pavarotti's signature song to carry it into posterity.  Although his later years were often marred by vocal decline and 'celebrityitis', he continued to be one of those special people like Beverly Sills who brought opera to a larger public.  He was and will remain a star and for those who had the joy of hearing him at his peak, few thrills in the opera house will match.  He will be missed.  Grady Harp, September 07
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Not a deep, thought provoking artistic masterpiece but a very good action movie that delivered more than I expected.  Wahlberg did a far better job than I thought he was capable of.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|When I saw the announcement for this, I was skeptical.   The HD concept was created to display movies at home -- large and widescreen with good enough resolution to avoid distraction.    This is a TV show.  Even though paramount says it was remastered, it must have been shot in 4:3 format.   This HD version is still 4:3.   Why pay a bunch of money for improved resolution?   So, you can use the zoom feature and fill the black, side-bar area?   I don't think so.    I LOVE Star Trek and have watched all the series for years.  But, I would never pay money to get the original series UN-formated for high-def, widescreen.       Stop playing around and get back to putting widescreen material on HD-DVD!!!!!!!!!!
0440419514|5.0|Could not put this book down, as soon as finished #1 had to read #2.  Spouse was reading also so i had to read as fast as I could. Was sorry when had finished the trilogy.  Great book, now daughter and granddaughter are enthrawled. Will keep this and read it again.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|let me at first say that this is a fantastic movie.  i had the pleasure of being one of the few who willingly saw this in the theaters and got to enjoy the spectacle of two films being put together in such a presentation that makes one wish that they could experience it a million times over.  that is the true experience of an amazing live performance and something that can only be done a handful of times.  the two films fit together and complemented each other so well, it was like seeing two incredible bands play one show together and just fed off each other that it just blew your socks off.      this is the part where we get to buy the album.  we get to sit in the privacy of our own homes and remember all the parts that we saw with our friends that just exploded when we saw them live; and just like each band needs to put out their own album to be able to support themselves, so must these movies.      yes, seeing the movies together in a theater with hillarious fake trailers and missing scenes; laughing hysterically and being glued to your seat while trying to see if you could hold off the bathroom break for three plus hours was an incredible experience.  i wish i could see this movie like that over and over, but that's the telling of a truly incredible live experience --you will never see those two performances the same again and if you missed the experience you have no one to blame but yourself, and you can't be upset because you can't experience that at home.      as for me, i'm going to enjoy deathproof at home, maybe pause it a few times so i can go to the bathroom or make a sandwich, and remember the time i saw this movie in the theaters with friends and tell everyone i almost wet myself durring the last scene.
0783240236|5.0|I had not seen this movie in many years and I must say it was better than I remembered. As a kid it seemed very slow moving without enough shock to make up for it. Viewing it now I see many reasons for the slow ordinary first half of the film. To me it was to show that every day life is rather ordinary until something extraordinary happens! This is an amazing and ingenious film because it doesn't attempt to explain why the birds are attacking.....they just are! I always remembered the special effects looking unrealistic, but I thought they looked very good this time around. The DVD transfer looks crisp and clean, which may have helped FX. I am watching the master piece collection and I started with Psycho and the Birds......so far so good! Both are classic horror films and should be in every movie lovers collection.
B000PY52EU|3.0|Jackson was very good, as usual, but the plot was pretty contrived.  I found I was paying more attention to the sound track (which is outstanding) than the story line.
B000089RV6|5.0|Back in 1980, all the kids at my high school were anticipating the release of the new AC/DC album with Bon Scott's replacement. \\"It's gonna suck without Bon!\\" was the general consensus. Of course, everyone was blown away as soon as the album hit the turntable, with the 4 ticks of Track 1 Side 1 leading up to the revelation that, yes, indeed, AC/DC was back, in black, and they weren't going away. The way the tracks are recorded on both this version of the CD and the earlier one totally screws up the impact that this seminal album was intended to make.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|It's Dream Theater, what can I say? It's epic, hands down.    Systematic Chaos was actually the very first purchase I've made of Dream Theater. I'm fairly new still to the band, being that I started listening to them about over a year ago. But I have to say, it instantly became my favorite band once I heard their older songs.    Despite the CD being a bit pricier on my bit of the edge, it was damn well worth it.     The CD once again proves that DT cannot rust even with age growing on them. Honestly, they continue adding in over 10 minutes to each of their songs. But each of those minutes are beautiful and used extremely well towards making true music and art.     Absolutely beautiful to listen to, and I enjoyed my journey throughout the entire song. Thank you DT.

B000002KDG|5.0|This is a gem that was very much needed at the time of release. Disco was still squirming around the floor and Punk had not quite made it to the masses yet. I was at the Chicago Stadium for the Rust Never Sleeps Tour. I was and still am a huge Neil Young fan! The other reviews cover the bases on how all these songs are keepers. I have seen Neil Young solo and with every other configuration of bands including CSNY. That wonderfull night in Chicago I paid $8.50 for my seat is still fresh in my mind. I have another ticket stub for Neil with Crazy Horse twenty years later with the price at $85.00...For the Turnstyles... Every single time I listen to Live Rust I am back at The Stadium in my mind. If you were at one of the shows you know what I am talking about! I have seen Neil with Crazy Horse many more times through the years and many were great shows....but this was tops. If you think I am going on about the concert more than the CD thats because if you were there it will never be just a CD...It was a part of your life, If you were not there listen to the CD and close your eyes. You will be there soon! Of course the DVD is available as well. All in all this is Neil and Crazy Horse at their best. Every damn song!
0930289234|5.0|After hearing that the book THE WATCHMEN is at last being made into a movie, I thought now was a good time to reread it and see how it would stand up today.

OUTSTANDING!

1582701709|1.0|Please don't waste your money on this book. This book asks you to use the thought process to employ the laws of attraction. This concept dates back to neo-cognitive thinking and even catharsis. It asks you to change negative thinking into something positive. As anyone knows about meditation, all thoughts are valid. The key is to not invite them or to chase them away. Alternatively, all thoughts are welcomed, until a person can achieve the state of no thought. This book also mentions the creation of material wealth many times, simply by thinking it's so. All the great masters and philosophers, from Jesus, The Buddha, Lao Tsu, Joel Goldsmith, to name just a few, will agree that only through meditation will an individual eventually experience a state of bliss and what is needed in your life will follow. (Most will realize that we already have everything we need.) But most importantly, this book is associated with a pyramid program called The Freedom Plan or Liberty League International. Don't bite. Get Rich Schemes are few, and most don't include you.
B000VECAEO|5.0|Cant you people wait for the item to come out before you post negative reviews. Amazon always lowers the prices in the weeks after it is announced when its coming out. No you people go ahead start your crying about the prices. I mean its still 2 months away from release. And nobody is making you buy the set anyways. Anyways this by far one of Seinfelds best seasons because of its goofyness. The Dealership is one of my favorite episodes because of the truthfulness that it brings. I mean who hasn't bought a candy bar in a vending machine and have it get hung up and we start slamming and banging the machine. Of course George takes it to the limit with his candy lineup and then Kramer stretching the gas mileage. Then of course dealing with a car dealership. So anybody reading the comments for this set ignore all negative remarks. I'm sure by October the set will be 40 dollars.
0143038419|2.0|I found this book to be very disappointing.  It dwells far too much on the author's divorce and her issues with depression and loneliness.  If you're looking for a self help book on how to recover from a painful divorce and/or get past issues of depression, perhaps you'd enjoy this book.  However, if you're looking for an enjoyable tale about world travel, this isn't it.  The brief details included about the three countries Ms. Gilbert visited are not enough to make up for the overall dreary tone of the rest of the book.

0679736646|4.0|As usual, Dick tests the boundaries between reality, and . . . something else. One reason I was really interested in this book is a research paper I was working on. The data came from my psychological interviews, using the ZMET method. In this type of consumer behavior study, we find that what people say and what they actually do are often very different. People even make up elaborate descriptions and explanations to justify their imaginary behaviors. Ubik really fits this context well, because here Dick references a consumer product called Ubik, that is everywhere. Everyone wants Ubik, but no one seems actually to obtain it.

B000JVT09C|4.0|After a nearly two-decades-long absence, the Man of Steel returns to the big screen in this superb fifth installment in the Superman series. But this belated movie is actually more of a sequel to the first two Superman films, the second released a quarter century ago in 1981.     Director Richard Donner, novelist Mario Puzo, and uncredited screenwriter Tom Manckiewicz (listed as \\"creative consultant\\" in credits) conceived the initial outing, Superman: The Movie (1978), as a legendary epic of almost Shakespearian dimensions, a saga pitting good versus evil. Unfortunately, their lofty vision was not shared by producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind. Uncomfortable with a serious treatment of the Superman story, they brought in the husband/wife screenwriting team David and Leslie Newman to make the script more \\"campy,\\" à la the 1960s \\"Batman\\" TV series.     As a result of creative differences, and the Salkinds' refusal to pay Marlon Brando's steep royalties, Donner was replaced with director Richard Lester on the next installment, Superman II, and much of Donner's original footage was left on the proverbial cutting room floor. Fortunately, cinematic history has been kind to Richard Donner. On November 28, Warner Home Video finally releases his authorized version of Superman II, not only restoring scenes with Brando back into the film, but also restoring Donner to his rightful place as director.     To understand the downward spiral of the Superman franchise, consider 1983's Superman III, written solely by the Newmans and directed by Lester. An appalling collection of poorly timed slapstick gags, it has earned the dubious distinction of being the only movie in which comedian Richard Pryor can't buy a laugh. Superman IV in 1987 was even more unwatchable, suffering from bargain-basement production values and a PC script that reduced Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's classic superhero to a \\"No Nukes,\\" Bleeding-Heart of Steel.     Now, years after lesser filmmakers left the Man of Steel in rust, director Bryan Singer finally restores the untarnished, larger-than-life superhero to his pedestal.     Comparisons between Superman Returns and Superman: The Movie are inevitable, especially because Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris consciously planned this film to have the same look, feel, and sound of the original. The most obvious similarity is in casting relative newcomer Brandon Routh in the role of Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent. Routh bears an uncanny resemblance to the young Christopher Reeve; indeed, he looks as though he could be Reeve's younger brother.     Superman Returns builds upon the plot of the first Reeve movie, and part of the second. To explain Superman's absence from the screen during the past nineteen years, Singer brings him back to Earth after a five-year self-imposed exile, during which time he trekked among the stars searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton.     The movie opens with an amazing special-effects sequence as Superman's spaceborne ship hurtles through the galaxies back to Earth, returning to his family farm outside Smallville, USA. Voiceover monologue from his father, Jor-El--taken from Marlon Brando's unused footage for Superman II--sets the tone for the drama that follows. \\"Because of their [Earthlings'] capacity for good, I send them you, my only son.\\" Using Christ-like visual imagery, Superman is cast as Earth's savior, rescuing the planet time and again from those who wield the capacity for evil.     After a brief reunion with earthly mother Martha Kent, played by Eva Marie Saint, Superman reclaims his alter ego, Clark Kent, and his job in Metropolis as reporter for the Daily Planet. Things haven't changed much at the paper, except that cell phones have replaced desk sets and typewriters have been retired in favor of personal computers. Otherwise, editor Perry White (Frank Langella) is just as gruff as ever. Shutterbug Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is still the same earnestgreenhorn, and the only reporter in the MSM, aside from Tucker Carlson, still sporting a tacky bow tie.     But one important thing has changed. When Superman left on his intergalactic quest for his roots, former lover Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the Planet's ace reporter, believed she'd been ditched. Feeling betrayed, Lois won a Pulitzer Prize for an article, \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\\" \\"The world doesn't need a savior,\\" she tells Clark, \\"and neither do I.\\" He is devastated to learn that, on the rebound, she has given her heart to Richard White (James Marsden), the boss's nephew. What's worse, Lois and Richard now have a son, Jason.     Meanwhile, having discovered Superman's secret hideaway, the Fortress of Solitude, arch-enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) launches a diabolical scheme using crystals laced with Kryptonite--the radioactive remains of Superman's planet that render him powerless. Placed in the Atlantic Ocean, the crystals multiply, creating a huge, artificial island that displaces enough ocean water to threaten much of North America with flooding. It's an ecological disaster right out of Al Gore's most fanciful nightmares, one that will force millions to turn to Luthor if they want to stay dry. Cha-ching!     Brandon Routh more than fills Chris Reeve's boots, and also those of George Reeves, the square-jawed actor who portrayed Superman in serial movies and on television during the 1950s. Like Reeve, Routh convincingly projects the superheroic qualities of Herculean strength and speed, as well as honor, chivalry, and courage. However, this loner-hero is cast in a more human, vulnerable light, though without ever mocking his dignity and heroic stature. This is a nobler Superman: all the annoying touches that in previous movies were meant to undermine the character are absent here.     Every superhero needs a supervillain in order to bring out his best virtues, and the movie delivers by casting Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Although Gene Hackman is a great actor, he underplayed in the Luthor role a generation ago, almost to the point of nonchalance. Part of his failure to portray a true supervillain was due to his goofy wardrobe and even goofier sidekick (Ned Beatty). The sheer silliness undercut his credibility as a viable threat to Superman.     By contrast, Spacey's Luthor is a plausible adversary for the Man of Steel. \\"Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes and don't share their powers with anyone else,\\" Luthor snarls. Spacey's characterization conveys that, for little men with big ambitions, envy of the good can be the most corrupting motive. When I first saw Spacey in American Beauty (1999), his smarminess as anti-hero Lester Burnham really rubbed me the wrong way. But after seeing him as Jack Lemmon's duplicitous boss in Glengarry Glen Ross and as the deliciously sociopathic Luthor here, I find him uniquely suited to playing cads and villains--not unlike George Sanders (Rebecca, All About Eve) a couple generations ago.     Kate Bosworth is somewhat less successful as Lois Lane. Undoubtedly a better actress than the previous Lois (Margot Kidder), Bosworth's waifish looks and spiral curls aren't what come to mind when you think of the spunky journalist from the DC comic books. A stronger, more alluring actress, such as Hilary Swank, would have been perfect to play the female lead in Superman's life.    All in all, however, Superman Returns is a widescreen extravaganza with something for everyone.     For the guys, it has street cred as an action flick, with its shoot-'em-up pyrotechnics and computer-generated images. These are truly spectacular, because they don't look so much like special effects as like natural camerawork. In fact, this film comes off as even more realistic than another visually impressive superhero flick, Spiderman II.     For the women in the audience, the movie offers a heart-rending story of unrequited love, though hinting at the possible reconciliation of the(literally) star-crossed lovers in the next film in the franchise, planned for release in 2009.     For fans of John Williams's soaring score in the 1978 film, there is composer John Ottman's skillful weaving of Williams's brassy fanfare into the new soundtrack, and conductor Damon Intrabartolo's lush interpretation.     For older movie buffs, Superman Returns also boasts the first reunion (in dialogue, thanks to the sound editors) of the late Marlon Brando and actress Eva Marie Saint since they appeared as working-class lovers in Elia Kazan's 1954 classic, On the Waterfront.     And for the kids, the picture provides not just grand entertainment but also some wonderful lessons. Its themes of gallantry, honor, and bravery will cause even many adults to revert to the child's uncorrupted and innocent point of view. In fact, when we saw this movie at an advance critics' screening--in midtown Manhattan, no less--that was exactly how that normally blasé audience reacted.     If a bunch of aging, cynical critics can \\"Wow!\\" aloud at the implausible actions of their childhood hero, boo and jeer at the soulless villain, and rise to a raucous standing ovation at the end, then Superman Returns may just be the savior that Hollywood has needed during all the years that he's been gone.
B000244EMO|5.0|We, Sid the Elf, wanted a real nice B to kick the weekend off perfectly, so we picked up Predator. Well, Sid was stunned. Predator was a perfectly done action flick. Don't take us wrong, anytime Arnold is teamed with Jesse the body Ventura, Apollo Creed, and the immortal Chink Webber from Lockup the B will be flowing like wine. There was an ample ammount of explosions, totally awsome guns, and the toughest lines around.(We're not even going to mention anymore that anytime Arnold talks the possibility for hillarity is there) With that said, Predator was the perfect guy movie, the only thing that was missing was smokin hot chicks. But, we found ourselves saying no less than 10 times during the screening, \\"This movie is killer!\\" or something comperable.<br /><br />Arnold plays Dutch, a CIA operative who has the rep of being the baddest of the bad. Dutch and his team, all of whom are extremely close to one another, are sent into the jungles of Central America to find a missing group of soldiers. The guy responsible for bringing them in? That's right, Appolo Creed. Or, Dillon! Him and Arnold go way back, and appear to be tight as we see in the famous \\"Whasa matta? FBI's made you gone soft?\\" scene. When they get to the jungle, things are definately strange. Dillon and Arnold's team are not gelling, and there is a strange presence in the air. That would be Predator, who is responsible for the missing soldiers. Sid is going to go out on a limb and say Predator might be the coolest villan in action movie history. He is a man-eating robot alien with an almost inperceptable cloaking device. Almost. Arnold and the team, with the help of the sweetest gun in action movie history, figure out how to track Predator. But, before they can do any damage to him, the Predator picks off everyone but Arnold, including the legendary Chink Webber. It got dusty in the North Pole when Predator finally got Chink. You knew the whole time that it was going to come down to Arnold vs. Predator. Arnold figures out a way to protect himself from Predator's tracking capabilities, levels the playing field, and takes him on. Sid won't spoil the ending, but it's awesome.<br /><br />So, Sid would have to say, if you're looking for a B action to laugh at stay away from Predator. However, if you want to get totally pumped and watch an all-time killer action flick, Predator is your Vehicle baby. And if you haven't seen Predator yet, Sid doesn't know what to tell you. Actually, yeah he does. Get a copy ASAP.res out a way to protect himself from Predator's tracking capabilities, levels the playing field, and takes him on.

B000QXDED6|5.0|300--director Zack Snyder's faithful, if controversial, adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel--is a visually striking, though loosely interpreted, telling of the now-immortal Battle of Thermopylae.    Over a three-day period in 480 BC, King Leonidas and his three hundred Spartan bodyguards--with the assistance of about seven hundred Thespians and few thousand volunteers from other Greek city-states--fought the massive armies (estimated in most ancient accounts to have exceeded one million) of Persian Emperor Xerxes I at the Pass of Thermopylae on the Gulf of Malis. Through martial skill, fearlessness, and sheer audacity, Leonidas and his warriors held off the Persians long enough for the Athenians to prepare their navy to defeat the Persians at the Battle of Salamis, and thus save Greece.    The Battle of Thermopylae is a timeless tale of valor and honor. It takes its place in history with other legendary military standoffs--such as the Battle of the Alamo in 1836, where a few hundred Texans held off the Mexican army for thirteen days, and the 1939 \\"Winter War,\\" the World War II battle in which Finnish forces repelled over one million Russian invaders. Why, then, would a cinematic retelling of this remarkable event of so long ago prompt argument and debate today?    Historical film epics are rarely contentious enterprises nowadays, precisely because they portray events long since past. The ones that do spark heated debate tend to have religious themes, such as The Passion of the Christ and The DaVinci Code. If there's any blasphemy to be found in 300, it's against oracles and deities long since relegated to the dustbin of piety. Certainly there was little controversy in 1962 when Miller's original inspiration, director Rudolph Maté's The 300 Spartans, was released. So what's happened in the forty-five intervening years to make Snyder's remake-of-sorts so controversial?    In a word: multiculturalism.    Just as in the days of the ancient Greeks, the theme of saving the civilized West from barbaric Asiatic hordes is made quite explicit in 300, and given voice by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler): \\"A new age has begun, an age of freedom. And all will know that three hundred Spartans gave their last breath to defend it . . .The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many.\\"    But unlike the days of the ancient Greeks, it's now verboten to suggest the superiority, let alone the preferability, of Western culture to any other--including, presumably, Persian culture. And therein lies the controversy over this film. As \\"civilized people,\\" we're not supposed to like war, much less relish military victory or the enemy's demise. Hell, we can't even use the word \\"enemy\\" anymore to describe the enemy. These days, when Hollywood goes to war, our fighting men are represented--at best--by that ubiquitous fixture of modern cinema, the \\"reluctant warrior.\\"    In contrast, Leonidas's Spartans are hardly reluctant: Born and bred since childhood to fight for their military city-state, they're professional soldiers who revel in the sting of battle. Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) sends an officer to present an ultimatum to his vastly outnumbered foe: \\"Spartans, lay down your weapons!\\" Rather than accommodating the Persians (as, say, the British Navy did circa 2007 AD), Leonidas roars back: \\"Persians, come and get them!\\"    In all of battle lore, Thermopylae stands as the ultimate \\"David versus Goliath\\" confrontation of civilizations. To most people familiar with Italian Renaissance art, this legend conjures in their minds the great statues by Donatello and Michelangelo. Both are nude figures of the young Hebrew warrior. Donatello's David is but a boy. Without a care in the world, he leans on his sword with one hand, his other hand resting effeminately against his hip. Think of the eternally boyish Leonardo DiCaprio or Elijah Wood. More famous is Michelangelo's manlier David. He's muscular and stands erect, gazing off in serene contemplation. But, while Michelangelo captures David's physical beauty and agility, his is a static, motionless fighter; the sculpture merely hints at the decisive moment ahead. Think Brad Pitt in Troy.    Any David who would have a chance of felling the monstrous Philistine had better be credible--one tough s.o.b. Baroque-era sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini depicts just that kind of David--not naked, but clothed in soldier's tunic, coiled back to fling the rock at Goliath. Bernini freezes his hero in motion: Taut, fierce, and grimacing, Bernini's magnificent figure conveys both the intent and the execution of his bold, violent act.    The genius of 300 lies in Snyder's and cinematographer Larry Fong's ability to dramatize that same highly stylized sense of kinetic energy and unfreeze it. In particular, as Leonidas, the burly, bearded Scottish actor Gerard Butler is Bernini's David brought to life.    Many reviewers have touted 300's \\"comic book\\" visual sensibility. To me, it doesn't look like a comic book at all, but rather like an oil painting set in motion. In fact, anyone familiar with Frank Miller's striking illustrations will note the same qualities in those works. Using a color scheme of burnished tones, 300 manifests a sophisticated visual unity that owes much more to Jacques-Louis David's painting The Oath of the Horatii (1785) and Akira Kurosawa's film Ran (1985) than it does to Spider-Man or The Fantastic Four. The rich, gorgeous Technicolor prints further intensify the viewing experience.    This visual stylization is one reason why 300 seems more real than the more historically accurate The 300 Spartans--even though the original was shot on location in Greece, while Snyder filmed his entirely on soundstages in Quebec. For example, the new, stylized Spartan is divested of his breastplate in favor of a uniform that makes him look like a cross between Kirk Douglas in his Spartacus get-up and wrestler Hulk Hogan in leather briefs. But the 1962 movie was filmed mostly from a distance, and the actors' stiff performances were even more distant. The battle scenes looked like re-enactments; you could tell those Spartans were just a bunch of extras holding spears and shields.    Not so with this crew: While the scenery in 300 may have been rendered by CGI artists, the six-pack abs and bulging biceps on these Spartans are real, the product of a grueling five-month-long exercise regimen in which the actors also got Marine Corps \\"Oorah!\\" attitude training. And instead of remote, set-piece battle scenes, Snyder gives us relentless, in-your-face combat--beautifully choreographed bloodletting. He conveys with blinding clarity how the Spartans could pull off such a sustained, concerted defense against a numerically superior force. When they go into their phalanx battle formation, you immediately realize why individual soldiers became such a deadly weapon when they fought in unison, something the 1962 film barely depicted.    I could tell 300 was going to be a smash hit when the intelligentsia descended upon this movie, unleashing all the sneering invective their vocabularies could muster--from \\"militaristic\\" and \\"fascistic\\" to \\"testosterone-laden\\" and \\"jingoistic.\\" Typical was Andrew Sarris, reigning \\"dean\\" of American film critics, writing in the New York Observer:        \\"300 was as pathetically puerile as I had expected. Yet I can't say that it wasn't at least minimally entertaining. Indeed, there was a subtextual strangeness about the spectacle that would have made the ghost of Leni Riefenstahl nod in recognition.\\"    Fortunately, the attempt to cut this superb picture down to size is more of an uphill battle than the one that Leonidas and his men fought. What repelled so many of our literati is also the source of its unexpected devotion among mainstream movie fans, (to the tune of $421 million in gross receipts, as of this writing): Miller and Snyder invest 300 with the stuff of mythical legend.    Butler's Leonidas is a defiant figure with a bit of Phaeton and Sisyphus in him. He ignores the counsel of the Oracle (Kelly Craig), who orders him not to confront the Persians. \\"Trust the gods, Leonidas,\\" the governing council cautions him. Leonidas counters, \\"I would prefer you trust your reason.\\" Well aware that the very future of reason and democracy lies with his Spartans, the ascetic Leonidas faces down the decadent god-king Xerxes, proclaiming, \\"We wrest the world from your mysticism and tyranny!\\"    The epic tone of the story is further realized through the narration of Dilios (David Wenham), the one-eyed warrior who returns to Sparta to relate Leonidas's story of courage and bravado to his own soldiers, firing them up to do battle again with the invading Persians. Mere days after his death, Leonidas is already elevated to the status of Epic Hero.    As Leonidas's wife, Queen Gorgo, Lena Headey gives a stirring performance. When the movie opens, a Persian messenger (Peter Mensah) rebukes Leonidas: \\"Why does this woman think she can speak amongst men?\\" The queen fires back, \\"Because only Spartan women give birth to real men!\\" In a quiet scene before Leonidas heads off to war, she bolsters her king's confidence: \\"Spartan: Come back with your shield--or on it.\\" It's a lesson in honoring the spirit of a fallen loved one that's completely lost on the Cindy Sheehans of our age.    History buffs and armchair philosophers have come out of the woodwork to chide viewers for buying into the movie's inaccuracies. Just as common are complaints that the Greeks had slavery, that Sparta practiced infanticide, that the Spartan army was filled with conscripts, and that they--by gladly laying down their lives in a suicide mission--were hardly rational exemplars of  individualism.    With all due respect to the Borg, however, resistance to 300 is futile. Its grand sweep and awesome storytelling had me cheering Leonidas's fearless warriors. What can't be denied is the movie's premise that the seeds of individualism (which is a later, Enlightenment notion, anyhow) were planted in the Greek soil they so gallantly defended.    And, to anyone laboring under the misconception that soldiers are the opposite of individualists, I beg to differ. Over my years of military service, I've come to know many Airborne Rangers, Special Forces Green Berets, infantry grunts, Marines, and psychological operations specialists. To a man, these hardcore warriors personify the qualities of character exemplified by Leonidas and his hoplites: heads held high, rigorous discipline, physical prowess, intransigent certainty, moral courage, the ability to face reality at its most grim--and the willingness to think. When it comes to individualism, these guys walk the walk; everything else is just talk.    Through its images of crushing brutality, 300 reminds us that the bounties of civilization that we take for granted are a gift passed down through time from men like Leonidas. Or, in words famously (though perhaps mistakenly) attributed to George Orwell: \\"We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.\\"    With 300, Frank Miller and Zack Snyder have concocted an antidote to the steady diet of cynicism and derisive irony that Hollywood has been feeding our youth for decades. If you thirst for a tale that extols honor and reveres gallantry, in which the good guys are great and the bad guys are evil, then look no further than this stupendous cinematic achievement.
B000001EL7|5.0|Love Gun saw the original KISS line-up firing on all four cylinders and was in my opinion the group at the height of their powers. It was their second studio album in a row with producer/engineer Eddie Kramer, who I think got the best ever sound out of them. He certainly knew how to record drums..Peter's drumming has (had) never sounded better. And, as with most hard rock/metal albums, it sounds best when you crank it up REAL REAL LOUD!!<br /><br />I had just gotten into Kiss a month or two before this album came out (I was nine, very soon to be 10) and I can't forget how excited me and my music loving brothers were when we first got this album, which was not a disappointment. As with most KISS albums, things get off to a tremendous start with a great Paul Stanley song, in this case 'I Stole Your Love', which Paul says was partially inspired by the guitar riff to 'Burn', by Deep Purple. Powerful vocal from Paul, heavy and catchy as all hell guitar riff, great solo, solid drumming, etc...a real classic. After this, we get two Gene songs, 'Christine Sixteen', featuring Eddie Kramer on piano and a spoken word part by it's author, and the highly underrated hard rocker 'Got Love For Sale', a song that the band has never, to my knowledge, performed live (a shame). I particular love the bass playing on it and if you listen close enough, you can hear just a dash of acoustic guitar and a piano here and there. Great drumming again, and I love the guitar solo as well, which is, like most of Frehley's solos, very melodic and right to the point.<br /><br />'Shock Me' was guitarist Ace Frehley's vocal debut on a Kiss record and it really is one heck of a song. I think Ace's songs got worse after he started to sing them, but this song (and 'Into The Void', which is like 'Shock Me, Part 2') are the highly notable exceptions. After this, we get what is practically a re-write of 'Rock and Roll All Nite' in Paul's catchy rock and roller 'Tomorrow and Tonight'. For one of Paul's lesser songs, this is still pretty good.<br /><br />The second half gets off to a great start with Paul's dangerous sounding hard rocker 'Love Gun', with it's author once again in top vocal form. After this, we get what I think it's the album's low point, Peter's 'Hooligan'. Like 'Baby Driver' from the previous album, this is my least favorite track on the album, showing that Kiss should never have allowed any of Peter's tunes after 'Beth' to appear on an album. For the album's worst song, it's still not completely horrible, though and at least it's better than 'Baby Driver' and 'Dirty Living', which I wish was saying more.<br /><br />Things pick right back up, however (and stay up) with two more Gene songs, the unusual, but great jungle gym hard rocker 'Almost Human', which once again features some very cool bass playing, and 'Plaster Caster'. I had no idea when I first heard it what the song was about.... remember, I was a young lad of nine who had just gotten exposed to hard rock just a few months ago and didn't even know what a groupie was. I think this is a catchy, lovable song that can be enjoyed even if you don't know what it's about.<br /><br />I am huge fan of the album's closing number, the cover of 'And Then He Kissed Me', which Kiss wisely changed to 'And Then SHE Kissed Me' (even though imagine how daring and bold it would have been if they didn't change the gender!). Awesome rhythm track to this, especially all of the percussion. I love how the bass supports the melody by playing along with it. And, another strong vocal by Paul, who really sings the dung out of this song. A more than satisfying ending to this album, which in some ways would mark the end of an era for KISS. I don't think they have put out another album like it since. Buy this album!!still pretty good.

B000Q6GXW2|5.0|300--director Zack Snyder's faithful, if controversial, adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel--is a visually striking, though loosely interpreted, telling of the now-immortal Battle of Thermopylae.    Over a three-day period in 480 BC, King Leonidas and his three hundred Spartan bodyguards--with the assistance of about seven hundred Thespians and few thousand volunteers from other Greek city-states--fought the massive armies (estimated in most ancient accounts to have exceeded one million) of Persian Emperor Xerxes I at the Pass of Thermopylae on the Gulf of Malis. Through martial skill, fearlessness, and sheer audacity, Leonidas and his warriors held off the Persians long enough for the Athenians to prepare their navy to defeat the Persians at the Battle of Salamis, and thus save Greece.    The Battle of Thermopylae is a timeless tale of valor and honor. It takes its place in history with other legendary military standoffs--such as the Battle of the Alamo in 1836, where a few hundred Texans held off the Mexican army for thirteen days, and the 1939 \\"Winter War,\\" the World War II battle in which Finnish forces repelled over one million Russian invaders. Why, then, would a cinematic retelling of this remarkable event of so long ago prompt argument and debate today?    Historical film epics are rarely contentious enterprises nowadays, precisely because they portray events long since past. The ones that do spark heated debate tend to have religious themes, such as The Passion of the Christ and The DaVinci Code. If there's any blasphemy to be found in 300, it's against oracles and deities long since relegated to the dustbin of piety. Certainly there was little controversy in 1962 when Miller's original inspiration, director Rudolph Maté's The 300 Spartans, was released. So what's happened in the forty-five intervening years to make Snyder's remake-of-sorts so controversial?    In a word: multiculturalism.    Just as in the days of the ancient Greeks, the theme of saving the civilized West from barbaric Asiatic hordes is made quite explicit in 300, and given voice by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler): \\"A new age has begun, an age of freedom. And all will know that three hundred Spartans gave their last breath to defend it . . .The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many.\\"    But unlike the days of the ancient Greeks, it's now verboten to suggest the superiority, let alone the preferability, of Western culture to any other--including, presumably, Persian culture. And therein lies the controversy over this film. As \\"civilized people,\\" we're not supposed to like war, much less relish military victory or the enemy's demise. Hell, we can't even use the word \\"enemy\\" anymore to describe the enemy. These days, when Hollywood goes to war, our fighting men are represented--at best--by that ubiquitous fixture of modern cinema, the \\"reluctant warrior.\\"    In contrast, Leonidas's Spartans are hardly reluctant: Born and bred since childhood to fight for their military city-state, they're professional soldiers who revel in the sting of battle.

1857026691|5.0|I generally don't love reading books in long air flights and last time I read one of the grisham books which was so terrible that I thought I have been permanently scarred from reading books ever.  Then I just took this book from library and believe me I did not realize when the last 5 hours of my flights was over (It was 12 hour cross Pacific ocean flight) .  The book is simple and a pleasure to read, gives good historical perspective as to how Maths progressed . Also I got a feeling of how maths is different from Science . The strength of the book is the its historical perspective as to how Maths developed and not just getting stuck in Fermat's Theorem . I will call this book as \\"Evolution of Maths and Mathematicians\\" .  As an example, while starting I followed the author and understood that one of the difference between Math and Science is that Maths is exact, absolute (based on some very simple building blocks). Then he gives some great proofs of Pythagoras theorem , proofs that Sqrt(2) is irrational and  so on. (thees are in appendix if you want to skip them.) As we move to 2o century, he cleverly introduces another Mathematicians who proves that not all mathematical  theorems can be proved right or wrong. Such theorems can not be proven at all. He gave a very famous simple philosophical example to prove this point.Its a paradox with something on the line of \\"Find out if he is liar by asking just one question\\" .      Anyway, I loved the book a lot and I will strongly recommend it. Its filled with anecdotes and stories and it kept me spell binding to the end.

Not so with this crew: While the scenery in 300 may have been rendered by CGI artists, the six-pack abs and bulging biceps on these Spartans are real, the product of a grueling five-month-long exercise regimen in which the actors also got Marine Corps \\"Oorah!\\" attitude training. And instead of remote, set-piece battle scenes, Snyder gives us relentless, in-your-face combat--beautifully choreographed bloodletting. He conveys with blinding clarity how the Spartans could pull off such a sustained, concerted defense against a numerically superior force. When they go into their phalanx battle formation, you immediately realize why individual soldiers became such a deadly weapon when they fought in unison, something the 1962 film barely depicted.    I could tell 300 was going to be a smash hit when the intelligentsia descended upon this movie, unleashing all the sneering invective their vocabularies could muster--from \\"militaristic\\" and \\"fascistic\\" to \\"testosterone-laden\\" and \\"jingoistic.\\" Typical was Andrew Sarris, reigning \\"dean\\" of American film critics, writing in the New York Observer:        \\"300 was as pathetically puerile as I had expected. Yet I can't say that it wasn't at least minimally entertaining. Indeed, there was a subtextual strangeness about the spectacle that would have made the ghost of Leni Riefenstahl nod in recognition.\\"    Fortunately, the attempt to cut this superb picture down to size is more of an uphill battle than the one that Leonidas and his men fought. What repelled so many of our literati is also the source of its unexpected devotion among mainstream movie fans, (to the tune of $421 million in gross receipts, as of this writing): Miller and Snyder invest 300 with the stuff of mythical legend.    Butler's Leonidas is a defiant figure with a bit of Phaeton and Sisyphus in him. He ignores the counsel of the Oracle (Kelly Craig), who orders him not to confront the Persians. \\"Trust the gods, Leonidas,\\" the governing council cautions him. Leonidas counters, \\"I would prefer you trust your reason.\\" Well aware that the very future of reason and democracy lies with his Spartans, the ascetic Leonidas faces down the decadent god-king Xerxes, proclaiming, \\"We wrest the world from your mysticism and tyranny!\\"    The epic tone of the story is further realized through the narration of Dilios (David Wenham), the one-eyed warrior who returns to Sparta to relate Leonidas's story of courage and bravado to his own soldiers, firing them up to do battle again with the invading Persians. Mere days after his death, Leonidas is already elevated to the status of Epic Hero.    As Leonidas's wife, Queen Gorgo, Lena Headey gives a stirring performance. When the movie opens, a Persian messenger (Peter Mensah) rebukes Leonidas: \\"Why does this woman think she can speak amongst men?\\" The queen fires back, \\"Because only Spartan women give birth to real men!\\" In a quiet scene before Leonidas heads off to war, she bolsters her king's confidence: \\"Spartan: Come back with your shield--or on it.\\" It's a lesson in honoring the spirit of a fallen loved one that's completely lost on the Cindy Sheehans of our age.    History buffs and armchair philosophers have come out of the woodwork to chide viewers for buying into the movie's inaccuracies. Just as common are complaints that the Greeks had slavery, that Sparta practiced infanticide, that the Spartan army was filled with conscripts, and that they--by gladly laying down their lives in a suicide mission--were hardly rational exemplars of  individualism.    With all due respect to the Borg, however, resistance to 300 is futile. Its grand sweep and awesome storytelling had me cheering Leonidas's fearless warriors. What can't be denied is the movie's premise that the seeds of individualism (which is a later, Enlightenment notion, anyhow) were planted in the Greek soil they so gallantly defended.    And, to anyone laboring under the misconception that soldiers are the opposite of individualists, I beg to differ. Over my years of military service, I've come to know many Airborne Rangers, Special Forces Green Berets, infantry grunts, Marines, and psychological operations specialists. To a man, these hardcore warriors personify the qualities of character exemplified by Leonidas and his hoplites: heads held high, rigorous discipline, physical prowess, intransigent certainty, moral courage, the ability to face reality at its most grim--and the willingness to think. When it comes to individualism, these guys walk the walk; everything else is just talk.    Through its images of crushing brutality, 300 reminds us that the bounties of civilization that we take for granted are a gift passed down through time from men like Leonidas. Or, in words famously (though perhaps mistakenly) attributed to George Orwell: \\"We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.\\"    With 300, Frank Miller and Zack Snyder have concocted an antidote to the steady diet of cynicism and derisive irony that Hollywood has been feeding our youth for decades. If you thirst for a tale that extols honor and reveres gallantry, in which the good guys are great and the bad guys are evil, then look no further than this stupendous cinematic achievement.

B000N4SHOE|4.0|This biopic, starring Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as famed children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter, is director Chris Noonan's first feature film since the enchanting Babe, released eleven years ago. Even though Zellweger's goofy brand of charm swept me off my feet in movies like Nurse Betty and Bridget Jones's Diary, I prepared to go on auto-pilot while I watched what I thought would be a benign but sappy \\"chick flick.\\"<br /><br />Yet, when the opening credits rolled, I sat straight up as Zellweger dipped her painbrush into a water glass. In the close-up of the stirring brush, the water turns from translucent to a deep royal blue. I was struck with the sense of instant recognition upon seeing the work of a great but forgotten artisan materialize before my eyes.<br /><br />No, I'm not referring to Beatrix Potter, but to another woman from the early twentieth century, Natalie Kalmus. From the 1930s through 1950, she was color consultant for Technicolor, the company behind the opulent film process invented by her husband, Herbert Kalmus. For without Technicolor--a process Natalie Kalmus supervised down to the choice of paint and wardrobe fabric colors for such movies as Gone With the Wind, Duel In the Sun, and The Red Shoes--Miss Potter's director of photography Andrew Dunn would have had difficulty capturing that particularly saturated hue of royal blue.<br /><br />This is no small detail. While there have been great advances in multi-channel digital sound, nothing on the visual side has ever topped the warmth and feel of Technicolor's dye-transfer prints, which the company reintroduced to the screen in 1998 after a twenty-year absence. Although they discontinued that process in 2002, they've been able to maintain that trademark \\"look,\\" working with filmmakers at every step of production to create lush, vivid final prints with a new proprietary photochemical process. How fitting that this movie chose to honor the work of an artist whose exacting attention and mania for color detail in the printing of her work matched that of another.<br /><br />Miss Potter opens as thirty-two-year-old spinster Beatrix Potter occupies an upstairs bedroom of her upper-crust parents' London home. While it would seem she leads a charmed life of comfort and security, Beatrix is a veritable child-woman, bereft of both connubial bliss and human companionship outside her family, her life dominated by her snobbish, uptight mother (Barbara Flynn). Having rejected one unsuitable suitor after another (products of her mother's matchmaking), she has sworn off marriage. It appears that this poor little rich girl is fated to grow old, gray, and barren--as though she'd never lived at all.<br /><br />Beatrix's predicament is that she's a decidedly eccentric personality trapped in a period when the social circles prescribed and proscribed by rigid British formality allow for very little behavioral deviation, particularly from women. She has no friends to speak of, save for the cheeky farm animals that she sketches and paints. In fact, the lonely woman carries on imaginary, though serious, conversations with Peter Rabbit, Hunca Munca, Jemima Puddle-Duck, and Benjamin Bunny. In mid-drawing, she stops to scold them for their mischievousness, scrunching her nose, dimpling her cheeks, and squinting at them. In delightful, colorfully animated watercolor sequences, they wink back, oink, and shake their tail feathers. If another American actress affecting an English accent (such as Gwyneth Paltrow) had been cast in this silly role, I'd probably have left the theater straightaway. But Zellweger has such an irrepressible ebullience that her dotty prattle seems whimsical and endearing.<br /><br />Little does Beatrix realize that her miniature, imaginary world holds the key that will let her escape the lonely house and make her way in the real world. When she calls upon a publisher, portfolio in hand, the Warne Pothers (Anton Lesser and David Bamber) at first dismiss herchildren's book as unprofitable nonsense. But they decide to publish The Tale of Peter Rabbit anyhow, as a sop to their younger Pother, Norman. Acted with spirited resolve by Ewan McGregor, the sissified Norman has tired of \\"playing nursemaid\\" to his elderly mother and finally put his foot down, demanding a position in the family business. He takes Beatrix's \\"bunny book\\" quite seriously and throws himself into its publication.<br /><br />Now, movies with mama's boys named Norman usually wind up with female corpses in the bathtub, but this tale's passions are far more sensible. Norman's inexperience winds up being a boon to Beatrix, who's initially skeptical about his business acumen. He allows her to carefully supervise the book's presentation and printing. Soon, their business partnership blossoms into romance, although Beatrix's mother disapproves of her whirlwind courtship (as she intones, aghast) \\"with a tradesman.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, in order to give us a glimpse into her furry characters' origins, the film takes side excursions into Potter's childhood that almost undermine the movie. Child actress Lucy Boynton's portrayal of young Beatrix comes off as snotty and petulant. If the movie were merely about Beatrix Potter's quirky little \\"drawrings,\\" then it would appear that she hasn't matured at all since childhood, except by no longer being annoying.<br /><br />However, the movie's true drama is about Beatrix's maturing into a level-headed, business-savvy woman, and the main story arc, as old as Romeo and Juliet, redeems the picture. Norman's marriage proposal forces Beatrix, for the first time in her life, to make a decision against her parents' wishes. Upon visiting her banker, she discovers that her books have made her wealthy beyond her wildest dreams. Now having the means to strike out on her own, Beatrix finally chooses independence.<br /><br />Richard Maltby's script also touches upon Potter's tireless efforts as a conservationist. Here, the Technicolor effect is felt most strongly, conveying breathtaking mountain and waterfront vistas filmed on location in the Isle of Man and Scotland. Another nice touch, I thought, was how the script related Potter's efforts to preserve her beloved Cumbria from land development and possible ecological despoilment. Although shown silently attending a meeting of local agitators, our Miss Potter's solution is to attend a real-estate auction and to bid on a foreclosed farm. It's an uncomplicated (though perhaps unintentional) demonstration of how the free market can provide non-governmental solutions to its own perceived failings. By the time she died, in fact, Beatrix Potter had bequeathed to the National Trust for preservation thousands of acres in England's scenic Lake District.<br /><br />Complementing quietly heart-rending portrayals by Zellweger and McGregor is a poignant one from Bill Paterson, playing Beatrix's enthusiastically supportive father.  When he makes a point of purchasing one of her books, she protests that she could have simply given him a copy. \\"But I wanted to buy one, like everyone else,\\" he replies, beaming with a parent's pride. Emily Watson also turns in a quirky performance as Norman's sister, Millie, a proto-feminist who wears neckties and encourages Beatrix's nonconformist aspirations.<br /><br />While composer Nigel Westlake's score is treacly during the film's \\"fairy tale\\" moments, he does what any sensible British film composer ought to during scenes depicting Beatrix's and Norman's ardor and sorrows: he lifts heavily from Elgar and Vaughan Williams, which is always welcome to my ears.<br /><br />And though the story is uneven in its exposition, I nonetheless found a soft spot in my heart for Miss Potter. It's a tender film that transforms the screen into a stunning Technicolor storybook, as is appropriate for this hugely popular children's author. Projecting a quirky, benevolent sense of life, Miss Potter carries itself with quiet dignity and shows how one woman gained the world by keeping her soul.

B00005JPLW|5.0|300--director Zack Snyder's faithful, if controversial, adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel--is a visually striking, though loosely interpreted, telling of the now-immortal Battle of Thermopylae.    Over a three-day period in 480 BC, King Leonidas and his three hundred Spartan bodyguards--with the assistance of about seven hundred Thespians and few thousand volunteers from other Greek city-states--fought the massive armies (estimated in most ancient accounts to have exceeded one million) of Persian Emperor Xerxes I at the Pass of Thermopylae on the Gulf of Malis. Through martial skill, fearlessness, and sheer audacity, Leonidas and his warriors held off the Persians long enough for the Athenians to prepare their navy to defeat the Persians at the Battle of Salamis, and thus save Greece.    The Battle of Thermopylae is a timeless tale of valor and honor. It takes its place in history with other legendary military standoffs--such as the Battle of the Alamo in 1836, where a few hundred Texans held off the Mexican army for thirteen days, and the 1939 \\"Winter War,\\" the World War II battle in which Finnish forces repelled over one million Russian invaders. Why, then, would a cinematic retelling of this remarkable event of so long ago prompt argument and debate today?    Historical film epics are rarely contentious enterprises nowadays, precisely because they portray events long since past. The ones that do spark heated debate tend to have religious themes, such as The Passion of the Christ and The DaVinci Code. If there's any blasphemy to be found in 300, it's against oracles and deities long since relegated to the dustbin of piety. Certainly there was little controversy in 1962 when Miller's original inspiration, director Rudolph Maté's The 300 Spartans, was released. So what's happened in the forty-five intervening years to make Snyder's remake-of-sorts so controversial?    In a word: multiculturalism.    Just as in the days of the ancient Greeks, the theme of saving the civilized West from barbaric Asiatic hordes is made quite explicit in 300, and given voice by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler): \\"A new age has begun, an age of freedom. And all will know that three hundred Spartans gave their last breath to defend it . . .The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many.\\"    But unlike the days of the ancient Greeks, it's now verboten to suggest the superiority, let alone the preferability, of Western culture to any other--including, presumably, Persian culture. And therein lies the controversy over this film. As \\"civilized people,\\" we're not supposed to like war, much less relish military victory or the enemy's demise. Hell, we can't even use the word \\"enemy\\" anymore to describe the enemy. These days, when Hollywood goes to war, our fighting men are represented--at best--by that ubiquitous fixture of modern cinema, the \\"reluctant warrior.\\"    In contrast, Leonidas's Spartans are hardly reluctant: Born and bred since childhood to fight for their military city-state, they're professional soldiers who revel in the sting of battle. Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) sends an officer to present an ultimatum to his vastly outnumbered foe: \\"Spartans, lay down your weapons!\\" Rather than accommodating the Persians (as, say, the British Navy did circa 2007 AD), Leonidas roars back: \\"Persians, come and get them!\\"    In all of battle lore, Thermopylae stands as the ultimate \\"David versus Goliath\\" confrontation of civilizations. To most people familiar with Italian Renaissance art, this legend conjures in their minds the great statues by Donatello and Michelangelo. Both are nude figures of the young Hebrew warrior. Donatello's David is but a boy. Without a care in the world, he leans on his sword with one hand, his other hand resting effeminately against his hip. Think of the eternally boyish Leonardo DiCaprio or Elijah Wood. More famous is Michelangelo's manlier David. He's muscular and stands erect, gazing off in serene contemplation. But, while Michelangelo captures David's physical beauty and agility, his is a static, motionless fighter; the sculpture merely hints at the decisive moment ahead. Think Brad Pitt in Troy.    Any David who would have a chance of felling the monstrous Philistine had better be credible--one tough s.o.b. Baroque-era sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini depicts just that kind of David--not naked, but clothed in soldier's tunic, coiled back to fling the rock at Goliath. Bernini freezes his hero in motion: Taut, fierce, and grimacing, Bernini's magnificent figure conveys both the intent and the execution of his bold, violent act.    The genius of 300 lies in Snyder's and cinematographer Larry Fong's ability to dramatize that same highly stylized sense of kinetic energy and unfreeze it. In particular, as Leonidas, the burly, bearded Scottish actor Gerard Butler is Bernini's David brought to life.    Many reviewers have touted 300's \\"comic book\\" visual sensibility. To me, it doesn't look like a comic book at all, but rather like an oil painting set in motion. In fact, anyone familiar with Frank Miller's striking illustrations will note the same qualities in those works. Using a color scheme of burnished tones, 300 manifests a sophisticated visual unity that owes much more to Jacques-Louis David's painting The Oath of the Horatii (1785) and Akira Kurosawa's film Ran (1985) than it does to Spider-Man or The Fantastic Four. The rich, gorgeous Technicolor prints further intensify the viewing experience.    This visual stylization is one reason why 300 seems more real than the more historically accurate The 300 Spartans--even though the original was shot on location in Greece, while Snyder filmed his entirely on soundstages in Quebec. For example, the new, stylized Spartan is divested of his breastplate in favor of a uniform that makes him look like a cross between Kirk Douglas in his Spartacus get-up and wrestler Hulk Hogan in leather briefs. But the 1962 movie was filmed mostly from a distance, and the actors' stiff performances were even more distant. The battle scenes looked like re-enactments; you could tell those Spartans were just a bunch of extras holding spears and shields.    Not so with this crew: While the scenery in 300 may have been rendered by CGI artists, the six-pack abs and bulging biceps on these Spartans are real, the product of a grueling five-month-long exercise regimen in which the actors also got Marine Corps \\"Oorah!\\" attitude training.

It's not only one of the most original movies in a long time.  It's one of the best movies of the 2000's.<br /><br />Memento is the story of a man trying to find out who killed his wife, although he has more obstacles to face than your average revenge character does.  He has a problem with his memory.  He can't make new memories and can't retain anything for too long of a time.<br /><br />This movie is extremely engaging.  You don't want to miss a single moment of this film.  It's quite good too.  The story, although it seems to be told backwards, is actually told in a different non-linear way.  It jumps from place to place, although it's still easy to follow.  This isn't your normal blockbuster entertainment flick.  It's deep.<br /><br />The Limited Edition DVD release is one of the best releases of all time.  It is loaded to the brim with special features.  Includind an excellent audio commentary from Christopher Nolan, plenty of features, a trailer, making of featurettes, and some amazing hidden features including a chance to watch the movie chronologically.  I haven't yet tried this but it's definitely worth it to better understand the entire movie.<br /><br />This is a definite Must Have.  A thoroughly engaging movie and a DVD that gives it due respect.

It's hard not to be in awe of the guy's drive and talent, though I was still left with a lingering bad taste of him being a little too taken with himself. Given his huge talent and success from such an early age, who can blame him for some self-absorption, but it still took away a bit from the book.

0689865384|5.0|This a review for the audio book version of \\"Uglies\\" performed by Carine Montbertrand.<br /><br />  This is geared towards young adults, but believe me it's a book for any age. Scott Westerfeld is one of the few male authors out there who can successfully tell a story through young girl's eyes and get it right. This book is about a world divided into two parts, just as humanity is, ugly and pretty. Up until your 16th birthday you are considered an Ugly, you go to ugly schools, live in ugly dorms, reside in ugly city all the while dreaming of that one day when you will become pretty and get to live the good life in pretty town. Young girls and boys are told they are ugly by their parents and the government, they think they are too fat or skinny; they have big noses and squinty eyes. All they have to look forward too is that day when they turn sweet sixteen and get to shed their Ugly skins to be \\"normal\\" and pretty. The Pretties live in gorgeous buildings, throw parties all day; they seemingly have no worries and are always happy.<br /><br /> I know it seems just too literal, okay young people think they are ugly and when they \\"grow up\\" they will be able to do whatever they want, and pretty people always seem happier. It goes beyond that. Tally Youngblood is our heroine, her best friend Paris has been turned and she cannot wait to join him. She meets Shay and thus begins a quick friendship. Shay soon shows Tally another world, taking her to the \\"rusting ruins\\" on their hover boards (yes I said hover boards you back to the future freaks!) The ruins, are what is left of the \\"rusties\\" which you figure out are basically us, but so far gone and abandoned now its all being taken back into the earth, rusting. That world, the Uglies are told, had wars and famine and everyone was unhappy, so the scientist \\"cured\\" all that by mandating the surgery and therefore \\"saving\\" society.<br /><br /> Shay doesn't believe this is right, and tells Tally of another society, a secret one called the \\"Smokies\\" and she is joining them before turning 16. Tally is shocked! How could Shay WANT to stay ugly forever? Shay leaves, but not before asking Tally to go with her, but Tally doesn't want to be an ugly anymore...she wants to be happy so she stays, Shay does give her a map just in case she changes her mind. The government on the other hand connects Tally to the Smokies and blackmails her into finding Shay, if she doesn't she will stay Ugly forever.<br /><br /> I won't give everything away, but I will say that the rest involves Tally finding out who she truly is, and what she is capable of. You get to find out what the Pretties actually are, and why, and what exactly lies outside of Ugly and Pretty town. You also get to hear about the \\"Specials\\" which are Pretties but with deadly skills.<br /><br /> I cannot recommend this book enough, it's a quick read, its not Kierkegaard but its pretty darn fascinating nevertheless. The reader of this audiobook does an excellent job! I cannot wait to read the second in the series \\"Pretties\\".\\" and she is joining them before turning 16. Tally is shocked! How could Shay WANT to stay ugly forever? Shay leaves, but not before asking Tally to go with her, but Tally doesn't want to be an ugly anymore...she wants to be happy so she stays, Shay does give her a map just in case she changes her mind.

I cannot wait to read the second in the series \\"Pretties\\".

0783229526|5.0|I think the best way to describe this film as ON THE ROAD meets THE NAKED LUNCH on 'shrooms...  Road trip films, of course are a dime a dozen... this one, however, in my book holds its ground -- but its not for everybody.<br /><br />I feel what's great about it is that it seems to accomplish the near impossible:<br />In the past films have been made about people messed up on drugs...<br />In all honesty, watching people tripping on acid is only amusing for so long... virtually anytime you see someone on acid do in a film eventually comes across as an exploitational cliche you've seen millions of times before... the big come down's and bad trips... the flashbacks, a good vomit... then Jack Webb comes out and lectures you on the dangers of reefer and dope...<br />Or how about when film let the viewer experience the trip by doing funny things with the color and sound of the film, or even suddenly having a reverse negative shot with a guy in a monster mask, and zooming to the horrified druggie screaming, \\"My face! My face!  Some one's eaten my face!\\" - - that too is only interesting for so long...<br /><br />But this film does something very different... It is a COHERENT road trip story as told through the eyes of a guy who's - - well very messed up on acid....  We take the trip with him literally - - and yes, the psychedelic imagery is there, but along with it are the people and places and the narrative...  Amidst all the weirdness, the film is a delight to follow...  and classic Gilliam (sick, bizarre and funny.)  And yes, as the acid kicks in and out, things get strange... however, the narrative observations make the special effects more than special effects and guide you through the journey...<br /><br />Ultimately, let's face it, Vegas may very well be a good symbol of all that is loathsome, cheap and sleazy in America - - and it is a place where often the real does meet the surreal in bad taste, but via the film and novel, the surrealism of \\"American Kiche\\", and the mundane and ridiculous are taken to an extreme that is well worth the watch...<br /><br />In conclusion: A film NOT for everybody, but if you're like me, an amateur social anthropologist with a love from \\"schlockus americanus\\" as well as the 60's and 70's, and both fascination with and disdain for American popular culture, this is a film that is visually as well as intellectually entertaining... dare I even say funny.  - - If however, you don't share this bizarre little fetish of mine and can't appreciate the film's cynical tongue in cheek humor... then I'll be honest: you won't like it very much.<br /><br />P.S. If you like this film, I strongly suggest getting your hands on Zappa's 200 MOTELS if it ever gets reissued again.  I also dare say if you liked it, you'd probably dig the FIRESIGN THEATRE as well...taken to an extreme that is well worth the watch...

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's debut(?) album Hybrid Theory really took the world by storm.  And all the praise it received is well worth it.  It's a great CD.

B000CCD0HQ|5.0|This was the first ZZ Top album I bought back in 1974. I own several ZZ Top albums and although I enjoy them all, this one still remains my all-time favorite. Even back then what seperated them from other bands was their tightness and their driving beat. They also had an eerie and humorous touch on some of their great songs. Billy Gibbons is a magician with the guitar and Dusty Hill on his throbbing bass and Frank Beard on drums are both naturals. I honestly believe this group is a world-class band.  In the 90's, this CD was released in an ultra slick sound of heavy reverb and punchy echo drums and to me it sounded SANITIZED. I still like it because the music was so good, but now it has been re-released with the original up front and natural sound and it seems to carry a big beat punch. It sounds a lot more authenic and like a real bar band on a moonbeamed Texas night. Tres Hombres in its original form is pure heaven for any guitar junkie. My Favorites: La Grange, Precious & Grace, Master of Sparks, Waitin for the Bus..oh well..the whole album is great! On My All Time Top 10.

B000E97HIA|5.0|During the 80's and early 90's Prince was THE superstar.  The late 90's and early 00's weren't as nice to him but he returned to form with two stellar releases (this and the previous album [[ASIN:B0001XTRCI Musicology]]).    This is a great CD.  Prince is one of the best artists for many reasons.  It's quite a good release I suggest all Prince fans check out.    Highly recommended.
B000RJO578|4.0|Dvd case arrived broken and dented so unable to close it, but dvd is fine.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I give this CD five stars because it deserves it.  It's not as good as the first two becuase of a couple reasons.  Mike Shinoda's rap is minimal at best, and the songs are politic heavy, and there's swearing, but there's something brewing here that makes me give this CD a five.    It's brilliant.  It's different and it's interesting.  Although the songs are less satisfying than their other releases, it's the nature of these songs that makes this a 5 star release for me.    Wake  Given Up 4/5  Leave Out All the Rest 3.5/5  Bleed It Out 4.5/5  Shadow of the Day 4/5  What I've Done 5/5  Hands Held High 5/5  No More Sorrow 5/5  Valentine's Day 4/5  In Between 5/5  In Pieces 3.5/5  The Little Things That Give You Away 5/5 *Personal favorite    It's not for everybody and may even alienate most Linkin Park fans, but it still gets a definite recommendation from me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As for me, Firefly/Serenity world is just the best Sci-Fi movie universe for this moment. When I critically need to feel myself alive I just dive for about hour into this world. No extreme sports, no adrenaline.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin' in the Rain is considered one of the greatest films of all time and I can definitely see why.  No, it's not an intellectual deep thinking man's movie.  No it isn't one known for the breathtaking camera angles and visuals, and no it doesn't have a plot that's so rich that you're bound to lose focuse halfway through.  It has heart, and that makes up for it.    It's one of the most perfectly executed, and brilliantly scripted movies of all time.  It's fun, exciting, and the perfect family movie.  It doesn't try to be something it's not.  I could go on and on about what makes this movie great but I'm going to stop and actually spend some time reviewing the movie.    As silent films are fading and being replaced by talkies (films with sound) two silent actors struggle to find their way in the ever chaging world of Hollywood.  Without going too deep into the plot I do have to say that this movie is one that people may see as overrated simply because every magazine or poll ranks it in the Top 10 greatest list.  Coupled with the fact that 70% of fans love it I don't see how it's overrated.    The DVD is a definite must have.  A commentary featuring every person who was alive at that time that worked on the movie.  PLenty of featurettes and even an outtake from the film.  This is a definite must have.    Definitely Must Have.
0060764864|4.0|I thought I would be bored listening to an audio book and not pay attention. I listened to this while driving 1200 miles in one weekend. It was the nicest, incredibly long drive I've ever had. The book is a little dark but I was impressed with the writing, especially since Carson McCullers was only 23 when she wrote it. My book club had selected this book and I don't think I would have listened to it otherwise. Although, I like lighter Southern Genre books. Still, having grown up in the South, I thought it was a pretty realistic portrayal of the times and the people. But just one tragedy after another and from what I have read about McCullers, somewhat autobiographical.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvana's In Utero is kind of follow up album everyone hopes for.  It's totally different from the light hearted [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]].

B0002NRRAG|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux's voice is just perfect. It's the kind of voice you just desperately want to listen to--she could be singing the dictionary and I'd be enthralled. But of course, she's working from a brilliant and interesting combination of songs here so it really is a wonderful CD.<br /><br />\\"Dance Me To the End of Love,\\" \\"Between the Bars,\\" and \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" are my absolute favorites. In each, Peyroux brings the song to her--you temporarily forget that anyone else has ever sung it. \\"Lonesome\\" is particularly good; just a subtle change in her voice and it all comes together amazingly. A lot of the time I wonder what some wonderful song would sound like in a female singer's voice. Now I ponder more specifically: what would it sound like if Peyroux sang it?<br /><br />Her French is wonderful and so CLEAR which is a blessing for those of us with high school French, who nevertheless want to understand the words.<br /><br />A necessary CD. If only to put you to bed with sweet dreams every night. ;)
B00005JKCH|5.0|When Spider-Man came out people were finally happy to see a comic book movie do justice.  The X-Men movie also came out around this time but before this, Superman: The Movie reigned as the best example of a comic book movie, and this is in no way to say that Superman: The Movie or the first Batman are done badly.  They could have been even better.    Spider-Man gives you a great character, plenty of action, and a great storyline.  It's what action movies strive to do.  And Sam Raimi was the perfect director for this one.  With [[ASIN:B00005RYLE The Evil Dead (Book Of The Dead Limited Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000A3XY9Q The Evil Dead 2 (Book Of The Dead Limited Edition)]] people knoew he could give these films justice...and did he ever.    These are two of the most packed DVD's in history.  It disects the movie from every angle.  Two commentaries, a trivia track, plenty of featirettes, and who knows what else are included on these discs.  A Must Have for all comic book fans.    Highly recommended.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I found this series to be very entertaining and worth the price. I only gave it four stars due to the last disk being almost entirely filled with global warming propaganda. Other than that I was very impressed with the quality and considerable effort the creators put in to this product.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of the Megadeth remasters. I prefer the sound of the originals, since they're the true sonic snapshots of whatever Dave and Co. sounded like at the time.    Having said that... \\"So Far, So Good... So What!\\" has always sounded like it was recorded inside of an empty Campbell's soup can. It's a 35-minute soundtrack to a headache.     This remaster rescues some of Megadeth's greatest tunes (\\"Set The World Afire\\", \\"In My Darkest Hour\\") putting some muscle on those tinny-sounding musical bones. It's well worth the upgrade if you own the original, but if you are nostalgically tied to the sound of the original (as I am to  \\"Rust In Peace\\") then stay away... this SFSGSW sounds very different.
031236198X|5.0|Excellent and fast read.  Anyone in a leadership position will love this book.  All of the key characters in your organization are exemplified on the \\"ice\\".
B000001Y42|5.0|This album may have followed suit in the post grunge craze of the mid 90's..  . but in retrospect its musical quality and overall originality make it essential to any grunge/metal/hard rock fan.  Fred Durst may have ruined the image/ego of the band with his superfluous lyrics but that does not tamper with the quality of the sound.  You can really hear the pain in his voice throughout the album.  Wes Borland wrote some of the most high flying and complex riffs for this album... much more variety than almost anything you can pick up on the radio.  It's a shame he left the band.  John Otto... my goodness that man is made of rhythm.  His jazzy beats along with DJ Lethal's samples really add a unique blend of rhythm to this album.  Overall I believe despite the \\"fact\\" Limp Bizkit may have \\"sold out\\" (whatever that means, reference to Tool's 'Hooker with a Penis') this album is worth picking up.  If you have any appreciation for the Nu-metal/Nu-rock genre you are going to have to check this out.
B00005JM20|5.0|One of the things that makes Rowan Atkinson a comic genius is that he's a master at both spoken and physical comedy.  While fans of Mr. Bean will see Atkinson's physical comedy, fans of the Black Adder series know his comic timing is truly a thing of beauty.<br /><br />Johnny English is one of the very few pieces that shows Atkinson giving equal time to both.  The scene at the funeral can go down as a comedy classic.  This film is hilarious.
B00008WT5E|5.0|.....And this is one of them. It's simply astonishing what this band can do with anywhere from 2 to, at absolute most, 4 power chords.  I mean, they take a couple of chords......literally two or so notes.....and create unforgettable, compulsively listenable, great music.       Powerage is one of those albums whose music is almost an 'ah ha' experience. What I mean is, it's as if these riffs, their rhythm and sound, just deserve to exist.  To me, great music is something that is there waiting to be uncovered and exposed to the world.  Obviously the Young Brothers and Bon Scott created this music....but it's as if these are tunes that were meant to be....and through their creation.....they were brought into the world.     I grew up on AC/DC.....my teenage years totally encompassed within the decade of the 80's.  My first of their albums was purchased with a $ 10 bill I found in a K&B Drugs parking lot while going back to the car with my mom.  I was 12.  I used that $ 10 to buy Back in Black ( record of course )      A short time later, my aunt asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I said \\" an AC/DC album\\"  still not knowing enough about the band to be specific.   Well, on Christmas morning at my relative's, I opened up the record for Powerage.  I'd never heard of it and only knew the band with Brian Johnson.  I was a bit confused because the letters 'AC DC' were written in a different way on the album's cover than the 'new' way, which is that angular, geometric presentation with the lightining bolt in the middle that everyone is familiar with. Anyway, once I got home and listened to it, I was blown away.         Only recently, did I start listening to them again. I lost interest for the last 15 or more years.  Now, I realize why I'm so picky about music.  I now realize why I don't really care for 80 percent or so of the junk that passes for music these days.  The reason:  I was brought up on real music.  I listened to actual talented musicians who created serious meaningful riffs as a young person.  Being exposed to AC/DC basically spoiled me and , as a result, music has to really be good for me to like it.  Don't get me wrong - I'm not some kind of snob, I have everything in my CD collection now from Hank Williams, The Beatles, some choice modern pop-rock, 70s and 80s classics, all the way to Mozart.   That being said, I also have AC/DC and they have the most of any to do with the way I look at and enjoy music these days.    Enough for my history, as for the album....it's an incredibe virtuoso of hard rock with tinges of blues intermingled.  From the steady rhythmic cadence of \\"Gone Shootin'\\" to the almost Westernish, yet also hard rock- wailing guitair of \\"What's Next to the Moon\\", this collection of songs represents an iconic band at the peak of their talent.      I'd forgotten how much Bon Scott puts himself into the songs.  I mean, he gives everything he's got into the vocals.  I'm not talking about being loud and screaming.  What I mean, is the emotion and the \\"I've lived what I'm singing about here\\" presentation.   His lyrics are sometimes sarcastic, sometimes humorous, but always the perfect compliment to the hard-edged music that thrums along.  Speaking of humorous, and there are frequent examples on Powerage, Here's one :   \\"  Riff Rafff....it's good for a laugh....(then he adds )   \\"haw haw haw\\" in a kind of sarcastic manner. I was driving around the other day listening to this line, not having heard the song in over a decade, just laughing out loud in my truck.  I'm sure other songs had me smiling stupidly as I made my way to my destination, but that's what quality music does.  It engrosses you and makes you feel good.      I know it's a bit of nostalgia.....but more than that, it's true talent and a special form of musical genius on display.  That's what Powerage is.  It's Hard Rock par excellence
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|One of my all time favourites. I have wathced this more times than I can count, and will continue to do so. The story line may not be the greatest, but the music makes up for any shortcomings.
1594489505|4.0|An easy read, compelling characters, and a tragic story linger long after the book is put down. I count my blessings to live in a free and open society like the United States after reading this book. Two women with very different beginnings (one abused, and one nurtured), share a brutish husband, with no apparent way out of their repressed, bleak lives. Despite the difficult circumstance, their story is not depressing (like Angela's Ashes), but uplifting in the way the characters persevere. I highly recommend it.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|I dont care if they put the movies together or not!! I mean it would be great if they did because thats how i saw it at the theatre but if they want to sell them apart then so be it! What bumms me out is that they arent going to put the fake trailers on either release!!! Not on Death Proof or on Planet Terror!! WHY?? WHY!!!!!! That was the most fun part of the whole experience!!! I loved the trailers and thats what was driving me to buy this on DVD....but now..i am not in a hurry to grab them any more....stupid stupid stupid....
B00000G6NI|4.0|As a budding teenaged music fanatic in the mid-seventies, I often heard the name Rory Gallagher whispered reverently among musicians, critics and fans far-hipper than I.<br /><br />Deciding to find out what all the fuss was about, I found a copy of 'Sinner...and Saint' in a cut-out bin somewhere in Chicago and took it home. Disappointed by its flat production and so-so songs, I filed it away and promptly forgot about it and Rory Gallagher.<br /><br />Four or five years later, while a college student in central Illinois, I happened across 'Photo Finish'. Feeling adventurous, I forked over four or five bucks and took it back to my dorm room.<br /><br />Man. What a revelation. The songs and Rory's playing leapt-off of the vinyl. Rarely had I heard a record lead-off with anything like \\"Shin Kicker\\" and \\"Brute Force and Ignorance\\". I was floored. To make a long story short, I became a Rory Gallagher convert that afternoon. And 'Photo Finish'? I pretty much wore it out.<br /><br />Which is why I was so thrilled to see Buddah's re-issues. The sound is wonderful, allowing Rory's stripped-down, unadorned music to really take wing and fill a room in all its glory.<br /><br />And track-to-track, this is undoubtably his best album. He never sounded so assured. Rarely does 'Photo Finish' falter. Steaming blues, Stax-inspired ballads, full-bore rockers--it's all here. And all good. And all drenched in Rory's sinewy and unflinchingly-honest guitar playing.<br /><br />As shy and unassuming as Rory was in life, 'Photo Finish' remains equally-vivid and attention-grabbing in his passing.<br /><br />Rest in peace, Rory. You were a wonder.

B000TSIK14|5.0|The Scorpions have always incorporated bits and pieces of what has been popular in pop-metal at the time - mostly successfully (conveniently forgetting about \\"To Be Number One\\" and \\"Du Bist So Schmutzig\\" which I have probably misspelled). \\"Humanity - Hour 1\\" is really just the Scorpions doing their thing, and really kicking it up a couple notches.<br /><br />It seems that many Scorps fans considered \\"Unbreakable\\" to be a return-to-form and in many ways it was; the band dropped the experimentation of \\"Eye II Eye\\" and just rocked out like it was 1984. That may have been exactly what the fans needed to hear at that point. I like nearly everything on \\"Unbreakable\\" and consider it to be their most consistent album since \\"Crazy World\\" - but I hardly ever listen to it.<br /><br />\\"Humanity - Hour 1\\" shows the Scorpions making a few stylistic leaps, while sacrificing none of their trademark sound, if that's possible. The hard rockers are here - \\"Hour 1\\", \\"Game of Life\\", \\"321\\", \\"The Cross\\" - and they'll more than satisfy fans of \\"Unbreakable\\" or \\"Blackout\\", even while experimenting a bit. \\"You're Lovin' Me To Death\\", \\"Love is War\\" and especially \\"Humanity\\" (truly a standout) fit that ballad/rocker hybrid model of \\"Rhythm of Love\\" and the remaining tracks, with the possible exception of \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" (think softer version of \\"Where the River Flows\\") should be received well by fans of \\"Winds of Change\\" or \\"Still Loving You\\".<br /><br />Without knocking the Scorps' lyrical \\"legacy\\" too much, I have to mention that the lyrics on \\"Humanity - Hour 1\\" seem to be light years ahead of previous efforts. OK, so there's a \\"321...are you ready to rock?\\" here and something about a \\"deer leaping highest at dawn\\" there...but overall, I've found myself paying attention to the words on this album because they work well in the songs and don't, generally, fall to the level of Herman Rarebell's contributions in the 80s or some of the embarrassing statements made on the \\"Eye II Eye\\" album (which coincidentally holds several of my favorite Scorpions tracks).<br /><br />All the songs on \\"Humanity - Hour 1\\" flow well together, while mixing things up stylistically and keeping an edge. This album may be my favorite by the Scorpions - I hope that fans will get past the fact that it isn't so much of a throwback like \\"Unbreakable\\" and see it for the career-high that it should be.tally holds several of my favorite Scorpions tracks).

032147404X|2.0|The book itself is cheaply made, it fell apart in my hands on the first read.   There are some good tips to be learned if you can stand the author's \\"humour\\", where he's repeatedly provided pages of nonsense followed by \\"I'm just kidding!\\"  I'm certain that the average three year old would find it hilarious, however if you're over that age and not mentally challenged you are more likely to find it distasteful at the least.      It's worth wading through at the library if you're already involved in photography and looking for some extra tips.  Otherwise, there are thousands of books on photography to choose from, have a look at some others and wait for the the re-edit of this one.
B000P2A24W|3.0|Unfortunately, one of those moments is when you hear the familiar voice-box \\"wow-wow\\" fist-pumper that has shown up on each album since \\"It's My Life\\" brought Bon Jovi back to the masses on \\"Crush\\" in 2000 - and then hear Jon, Tico, Ritchie and David join Big & Rich (argh) shouting \\"We Got It Goin' On\\". The track is, for me, the worst Bon Jovi has ever recorded, and nearly derails the entire \\"Lost Highway\\" album.<br /><br />Many of the complaints I've heard about this album revolve around the band \\"going country.\\" Bon Jovi has always had its New Jersey cowboy schtick - though the Southwestern tinges suited me far better than the adult contemporary country bit they've been evolving in recent times. My problem with \\"Lost Highway\\" is that it continues the pattern they've been creating since \\"Crush\\": each album is more predictable and forgettable than the last. The first listen through, I could finish most of Jon's vocal lines for him knowing the first few words. Tico's drumming, while always solid, is not the force that it once was. Ritchie shows more signs of life on this album than the last, but still seems to be missing the passion his licks once lent to each and every song (listen to \\"Something to Believe In\\" or \\"Dry County\\" and then \\"Lost Highway\\" - you'll see what I mean). So I guess, given the lack of musical originality and propensity towards repetitious lyrical clich&eacute;s that has become common over the last 4 albums, aligning the band more closely with Nashville seems only natural.<br /><br />That's not to say it's all bad. Aforementioned issues aside, \\"Lost Highway\\" (the song) nearly rocks, and is instantly likable, \\"(You Want To Make A) Memory\\" is a catchy tune that quietly builds but never fully lets loose, \\"'Til We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\" will hook you with some of the best harmony vocals (provided by LeAnn Rimes) since \\"Never Say Goodbye\\", and \\"One Step Closer\\" is a laid-back, reflective open-road kind of song that goes down easy (and doesn't rise back up like the Big & Rich tune).<br /><br />If you can get past the fact that there's nothing here that even remotely rocks with the conviction of Bon Jovi classics like \\"Keep the Faith\\", \\"Born To Be My Baby\\" or \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" (and the obvious country leaning of the whole thing) there's some good music here, amid quite a bit of pleasant filler and one or two giant missteps. \\"Lost Highway\\" is, at best, an average album - and certainly one of the most forgettable in Bon Jovi's catalog.Rich tune).     If you can get past the fact that there's nothing here that even remotely rocks with the conviction of Bon Jovi classics like \\"Keep the Faith\\", \\"Born To Be My Baby\\" or \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" (and the obvious country leaning of the whole thing) there's some good music here, amid quite a bit of pleasant filler and one or two giant missteps. \\"Lost Highway\\" is, at best, an average album - and certainly one of the most forgettable in Bon Jovi's catalog.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I bought this album having loved his other cd's and only really liked \\"Weeping\\" but I had the opportinity to enjoy it live at his concert in Dublin and I can't stop playing it - especially \\"Un Giorno Per Noi\\"
6305837325|5.0|You might imagine scenes of waves to become monotonous. Instead, it is mesmerizing. Relaxing music invites you into a tranquil existence. Waves are shown from numerous angles and all the locations have a pristine beauty. At times the music stops playing so you can focus more attention on the sound of crashing waves. Moodtapes are perfect for late evening viewing as they put you into a peaceful state of mind.<br /><br />I can also highly recommend:<br /><br />[[ASIN:6305078998 Moodtapes: Serenity]]<br />[[ASIN:6305081018 Moodtapes: Whispering Waters]]<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
0800141601|5.0|I liked this movie.  Some people give me weird looks when I tell them I enjoy adventure stories such as this one.  Maybe it's a childhood fascination with Nintendo and the Legend of Zelda series I was never able to shake off, I don't know.   Kings, queens, sword-fighting, everything you'd want in that kind of thing is right here in this movie, and done well.  The acting overall was very well done, with there being only a couple times when some exaggerated lines occurred.  I tend to think of these kind of movies as more adventure-like and just a little bit of romance on the side.  The action was nice, the story-telling was solid, and it was just a great movie overall.
0618680004|3.0|Given its subject matter this is a book that not surprisingly arouses a lot of fury. It also should be said that Dawkins has a pretty good sense of humor and portions of his argument are quite funny and true.     A particularly amusing aspect of the book is his attempt to either infuriate or flatter American readers by quoting the Founding Fathers. He even quotes Benjamin Franklin's \\"lighthouses are more useful than churches\\" without mentioning Franklin's observation that human beings, as bad as they are with religion, would probably be much worse without it.     But the real meat of the book has to do with critiques of the God concept itself and its here that Dawkins is a bit of a disappointment. Some of the comments, such as his mentioning of a particular model universe as \\"tantalizingly Darwinian\\" just sound \\"tantalizingly\\" stupid. And he doesn't help his case by using obscure language (what does it mean to say that design is \\"ultimately not\\" cumulative?)     To be fair, mainstream theological thinking has shot itself in the foot with some of its propositions, such as that of God being outside space-time. (a clearly absurd conceit when you stop to consider that \\"outside\\" is itself a spatial concept.) Parsimony and the infinite regress are standard criticisms of this concept of God.     Which brings me to an idea that I have yet to see an atheist seriously grapple with: that of a self-aware universe. Such a universe would fix some of the most vexing theological issues nicely: the causal regression problem wouldn't be a problem at all, because mind and matter would be inseparable the universe would be monic rather than dualistic, and parsimony would be achieved since a monic self-aware universe would be a hell of a lot simpler than a dualistic non-self-aware multiverse that brings self-awareness into being, which is Dawkins' favored solution. It's a concept that biophysicist Chris King and philosopher/cosmologist Christopher Langan have dealt with quite seriouslyand any atheist worth his salt should tackle the problem.     Overall a good, though not great, book.
B00005JPLW|1.0|I have never been disappointed with Amazon before.  This was a first.  I ordered the movie 300 for my son as a gift from Amazon.  When we decided to watch the movie and opened the box...No discs...Nothing.  I had to run to Blockbuster to buy it as there were guests at my house waiting to watch it.  I had to return the empty case for a refund.      The movie is GREAT!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I have been a fan of Mark Knopfler for almost three decades now. I am also a fan of Emmylou Harris' blissful voice. How a combination like this go wrong? The answer, of course, is that it couldn't: this is one of the most perfect blendings of vocals and instruments ever recorded. Mark's delightfully subtle guitar work is as good as it's ever been, and the collaboration as songwriters and singers was obviously positive for both.<br /><br />There are several standout tracks on the CD, including \\"Beachcombing,\\" \\"Right Now,\\" \\"Beyond My Wildest Dreams,\\" \\"All The Roadrunning,\\" and the best of the bunch, \\"If This Is Goodbye,\\" a song written in honor of the victims of 9/11. The distinguishing feature of all these songs is the subtly nuanced harmonies between Knopfler and Harris with a background of intelligent writing and superior musicianship.<br /><br />The CD is a celebration of togetherness, love, lifelong commitment, and marriage, all in one brilliant musical package. This CD is highly recommended, and a five star rating was never in doubt.
1400063515|2.0|the writing is witty, overly-educated and researched to the hilt, but what, practically, have i really learned? the point of the whole book is simply: 'what you don't know CAN hurt you' but other than reminding us that we all walk around with blinders on, i really don't get the point.     to be honest, i didn't finish it (half-way through), but if i haven't learned something that i can really apply or know how not to apply, you're asking too much of me.
0316067598|2.0|This is the kind of book I usually enjoy, real life accounts of anti-terror operations.  However this book is fatally flawed because the author avoids personal responsibility by using his narrow ideological blinders to blame liberal politicians and the liberal media for the largest number of SEAL casualties in a single battle.  The author doesn't consider the possibility that the losses could have been prevented had his team carried proper equipment or otherwise improvised a solution.  Furthermore, he expresses indifference to the torture and abuse of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison and doesn't consider the likely increased risk to US military and civilian personnel that resulted.  He obviously doesn't see the connection between killing innocent civilians and increased military opposition to US occupation.  I wonder what he thinks about the Haditha killings or the My Lai massacre.  Finally, this book rejects the idea expressed by Benjamin Franklin (1759): \\"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserves neither liberty nor safety.\\"
B00027JZ3E|3.0|I am a big fan of Joel Schumaccer (sorry about the spelling)and I had seen this film when i was nine and having it scare the hell out of me I couldn't sleep for weeks.A few years later after I became a fan of Joel's work and realized that he directed this I gave it another chance and realized that this film is SO CHESSY but I really enjoyed it. The scare factor was still there but having grown up since my last veiwing I was able to enjoy it and not be completly freaked out.Kiefer Suhterland in my opinion is the jewel of this film as David the leader of the teen vampires he gives an exceptionally creepy preformance and works well opposite of Jason Patrrick who also gives one of his best screen preformances next to Rush of course.This is definaltey cheesy eighties stuff and thats where some of my enjoyment comes from.This edition is loaded with features and a must for any horror fans DVD collection. Peace Out!!

B000059XUO|4.0|The only reason I even know about this film is because of the tragic death of it's star Brandon Lee.I watched for that reason to see Brandon in his last screen role, I was suprised to find that I really enjoyed this film.It has everything a movie could have action,comedy,drama,horror,and a tragic love story.I think that this was a ground breaking film as far as effect go shot reminicent of the first Batman film so the visuals alone are a reason to watch the film not including the stuff I mentioned above so if you are in the mood for a moody superhero movie check this out.
B000GFLE86|2.0|It's a sad thing when the most engaging music on a vocal album comes from the backup musicians. I had heard parts of this singer's first CD and enjoyed it quite a bit. Ms. Peyroux seemed to have a sense of style -- even if most of it was borrowed from you-know-who -- and a retro taste that made her stand out from the current crowd.    But I have been unable to listen to this entire CD in one sitting. In fact I haven't gotten more than three tracks into it without giving up in boredom. The pianist was doing more interesting things than the woman he accompanied.    Unbelievably lackluster performances. And not very well mixed or balanced either, although at least one can say the production is consistent with the flavorless artistry on \\"display\\" here.    Anyone who experiences M. Peyroux for the first time via this album will probably wonder what all the fuss is about. Sorry to be so negative. Even sorrier I spent money on this.
6305897786|5.0|Based on a complex, funny, and ultimately terrifying novel by Arturo Perez-Reverte, \\"The Club Dumas,\\" The 9th Gate has been altered and shaped for the cinema by one of the masters--Roman Polanski. The construction, photography, use of color, as well as the pacing in this film are brilliant, the ebb and flow of terror carefully orchestrated. Like real experience, it lurches toward a startling denouement. The story is disturbing and provocative, and ought to set the viewer thinking about the nature of evil, and the thin line between obsession and madness. It's cross-genre, if this worries you, but I understand this has recently been dubbed \\"high concept\\" by the folks in NYC and Hollywood, so perhaps this movie was a bit before its time, kind of crest of the wave. Consummate actors, Depp and Frank Langella inhabit this nightmare as if they've always been there. Every time I watch The 9th Gate, I see another piece of the underlying mosaic. If you are a fan of Perez-Reverte, never fear! His compromised souls are present here, almost exactly as he created them.
1591840562|4.0|A great checklist and lots of advice for anyone thinking of starting a company.     Nothing revolutionary, perhaps nothing you wouldn't have thought of yourself, but there is great value in having a well thought-out, complete, list like this.    Only 4 stars because the book seems biased towards venture-funded companies.
0606192166|4.0|In a way it's hard to believe this short story is what inspired the iconic movie.  Especially, since Tiffany's plays even a smaller part here than the movie.  It was hard to get Audrey Hepburn out of mind while reading this, because this book takes place twenty years earlier-during the WWII.  All material written in that time was always so serious (The greatest generation-they say.) that it was hard to picture such a flighty and worldly personalty for that time.  Though I have no doubt that it must be true.  It just takes an adjustment.  Overall, it's a good story.  I wish I could say the same for the three additional stories in this book.  To me those, House of Flowers, Diamond Guitar and a Christmas Memory were a waste of time and a disappointment.  But this book is still worth the purchase price for Breakfast at Tiffany's alone.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This film and Ridley's ALIEN inspired countless other Sci-Fi films with their visionary look at a dark future for earth.  These films inspired me to become a special-effects technician and I continue to to be inspired by them to this day.  A former boss of mine at Warner Bros. Studios helped to make the cryogenic chamber that the \\"real\\" Tyrell was found to be frozen in.  I heard that this scene was forever lost, but I hope that this version has that recovered footage.  Most people don't know that this scene existed.
B000P12LWY|3.0|This series is fun IF you forget it's supposed to be about Henry VIII and his court.  (I can't believe one reviewer called this series \\"90% accurate\\"!)  It's more like a historical fantasy only without magic.  The costuming is so Not Tudor -- it's RenFaire Retro.  Others have mentioned some of the more egregious errors, so I'll just list my favorites of what I've dubbed \\"Tudor Moments\\" here (spoiler alert):  Everyone riding in carriages -- carriages with large glass windows.  Cardinal Wolsey committing suicide -- and by slitting his own throat, yet!  No one ages a day although apparently years have gone by.  My absolute favorite:  the portrait of Richard III hanging on the wall in one of Henry's rooms!! That alone makes it worth 3 stars!
B00005JPVN|5.0|Homeless bum Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) winds up getting involved in a bad situation when he helps deliver a baby, but the mother (Ramona Pringle) gets killed in the process by plenty of thugs. These thugs are the followers of Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), a whipped contract killer who has plans for the baby. Smith can only turn to a hooker named \\"DQ\\" (Monica Bellucci), someone he recently had liaisons with, and the only woman who can deliver milk for her customers.    Michael Davis may only be known for his work on various direct-to-DVD features (including the horror comedy \\"Monster Man\\"). But he is making a major debut in silver screens with the bombastic action event of the fall season, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\". At first, it may be hard to top recent non-stop action funfests from this past summer (\\"D.O.A. Dead or Alive\\" and \\"Transformers\\"), but then again, it doesn't have to. And that's why it's such a great ride.    Cribbing from John Woo 101, \\"SEU\\" starts off with guns blazing and over-the-top violence you have to see to believe. As well as using pistols and AK's, Smith also uses carrots to kills his enemies. It may sound silly, but Smith's clever plans allow this trick to achieve its goal, especially with guns in hand. Of course, the carrot gags tend to get old (you can literally start a drinking game and drink whenever Smith eats a carrot, or Hertz making reference to Bugz Bunny and Elmer Fudd or Energizer Bunny), but Davis compensates with fast-paced wall-to-wall action that films like \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" could've used.    Besides, with tracks from AC/DC (\\"If You Want Blood, You Got It\\"), Motorhead (\\"Ace of Spades\\"), and Wolfmother (\\"Joker & the Thief), how could you not resist \\"SEU\\"'s intent to entertain your pants off?    And I'm surprised by the star wattage of a film like this. Especially since Clive Owen appeals more to adults. Owen may tend to overplay his hand and fill any air with corny one-liners that James Bond wouldn't even be caught dead saying, but when handling the action-packed scenes, he's a great Chow Yuen-Fat surrogate. He gets further compliments from Monica Bellucci or Paul Giamatti, two other actors who wouldn't wind up in a film like this, yet they fulfill their duties.    Shoot 'Em Up also had the nasty habit to go south when Davis inserts a scene of drama (this little batch of Kool-Aid was consumed in Robert Rodriguez's \\"Grindhouse\\" feature \\"Planet Terror\\"; frankly, trying to be poignant in a film that's pretty much a cartoon is a red flag) or flat-out explains the twist about why the baby is being targeted. That's all taken care of in the finale, which I dare not spoil.    It's a nice change of scenery when, in the midst of crappy sequels, a director has a set of balls to be unpretentious and deliver what's expected. I've said this concerning recent films from Michael Bay, Corey Yuen, or Edgar Wright, but Michael Davis proudly joins that list. And I hope that there are more well-intentioned filmmakers who can deliver the goods as much as he can. But this is coming from someone who doesn't watch these overrated Oscar-nominated films (which, I'm sure, will include Tom Cruise's next bullcrap project \\"Lions for Lambs\\").
B000O75VSU|4.0|I have been a fan of After Forever for quite a while now. Over the years, Floor Jansen has become one of my favorite female vocalists. She has the range and the power (not to mention the looks) that keep me listening to this band, and she creates some of the best symphonic harmonies of any of the female metal singers out there. This self-titled album is just as heavy as any other by this band. As usual, some death vocals pervade the album, contrasting the operatics, and the keyboards of Joost van der Broek give a little bit of a \\"prog metal\\" trait to the album, but not in an overpowering way. The short but sweet \\"Energize Me\\" is my favorite song on the album, with other high points being \\"Withering Time,\\" \\"Envision,\\" and the strong ballad \\"Cry With a Smile.\\"<br /><br />Let's face it: not everyone likes the whole beauty-and-beast metal thing, or the women-in-general-singing-in-heavy-metal-bands thing. But as far as these bands go, After Forever is a good one to get into. Floor's vocals aren't always completely operatic as say Tarja Turunen's (x-Nightwish), but they're always excellent and on target, and they seem to have improved a lot since the first couple albums. Not that her vocals were bad on those albums; she just seems to have refined her vocal skills more since then. I think the death vocals are generally fine, and probably tolerable even for those who don't like death vocals. The music is heavy, fast-paced, and of course symphonic, and the lyrics are overall inventive and well-written as always. This album is just another strong addition to After Forever's consistently strong catalog, and I hope to hear much more from them in the future.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This movie is RAW.  If you want a feel good, bubble gum and lollipops type of movie, this is not for you.      This is one of the BEST character studies I have seen in a long time. It's ugly, it's raw, but it's REAL and that could be why some felt so ill at ease. To like this movie is to accept that people really are this selfish and ugly-hearted. This could very well happen and that's what turns your stomach.    By far, Clive Owen owns this movie! You are disgusted by him from beginning to end, but find yourself rooting for him on several occasions, then mad at yourself that you are doing so. But then when you look at the alternative for Anna (Julia Roberts) in Dan (Jude Law), you allow yourself the moral misstep. Dan is quietly selfish and insecure. You realize early on there's an invisible bar that he's set that no one can meet or sustain.     At the end of this movie, you'll ask yourself (in regards to family, friends, and intimate relationships) are you the one setting the unrealistic bar, or are you the one trying to meet one? Are you being yourself while also allowing others to be who they are.    \\"Alice\\" was played BRILLIANTLY by Natalie Portman. She had the right balance of tough chick and little-girl-lost. You clearly understood she was someone who wanted to be loved and accepted \\"as is\\" flawed and all. Doesn't everyone?  She was the only innocent one, so to speak, in the entire quadrangle. She gave her body at the end masking her rejection and hurt.  We all know someone whose done this or continues to do this.  Although clearly misguided, Alice is the only one who didn't maliciously or selfishly hurt someone she claimed to love.     What makes Larry so remarkable is that he understood they were all flawed INCLUDING HIMSELF,  but unlike Dan, accepted it. He knew Anna was a depressive. She didn't have to stay \\"up\\" and perfect for him.  Larry allowed her to have her blue funks because he knew exactly what made her function comfortably. He was quite content in lifting and supporting her in her art of \\"photographing sad people beautifully\\" as Alice said, hitting the Anna nail right on the head. Anna was beautiful to the world, but was sad upon closer inspection. Dan never even realized her condition because it was all about him. Larry understood 'you are what you are,' anything better than that was a great moment.  Because he understood this, he knew how to manipulate and orchestrate them all into ultimately getting what he wanted.  Dan never got \\"it\\" in regard to his relationships because again, it was about him and distracting from his own securities. He had lived and supposedly loved Anna, but didn't really know her - same for \\"Alice.\\" Any revelations as to who they really were, came from outside sources.    Alice told Larry hidden truths about herself because he was totally open with her - nothing hidden which in turn made her comfortable enough to talk.     Julia gave a great understated performance. She wasn't overly emotional, she didn't rely on her sexuality, she simply existed from moment-to-moment as a depressive does.      I challenge anyone who hated the ugliness of this movie to rewatch it with new eyes.    GREAT-GREAT film!
0440241030|5.0|Jack Reacher, like John \\"Lilly\\" Lelankevitch [[ASIN:0595220037 Evil, Be Gone]], walks tall amongst other men.  Guys like these are drawn to evildoers and leave dark justice, vengeful mayhem and a certain silencing of evil in their wake.  Lee Child has created a character in Jack Reacher who conveys a very comfortable confidence in his ability to handle almost any dire situation that confronts him. The Hard Way is riveting and yet the author also equips his hero with comic relief capability that gives readers a moment to catch their breath.  This is a fun book to read and the climax is one of the best in the genre, drawing you so completely into the scene that you'll be looking over your shoulder to make sure there are no bad guys sneaking up on you.  Don't worry, with Reacher there...you're covered.  You should also check out [[ASIN:0595220037 Evil, Be Gone]] for another tough guy tale.

These guys are excellent actors and work so well together. It's definitely worth it. They keep the plot moving and know exactly how to give you a jolt! I've jumped out of my chair many times. I love it! I've got the second season pre-ordered.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I first ordered the HD-DVD but found it would not work on my HD TV.  The second non HD worked fine, but I think that a caveat should have been mentioned about checking if the HD would work.   As there is a difference between HD-DVD and BlueRay systems, Bose, which I use, has not decided which to use.   It is another Betamax vs VHS again.  The series is excellent, and even though I like Sigourney, I really prefer David Attenborough as the narrator due to his enthusiasm.   I really value this series.
0345494997|4.0|Good character study of Frank Loyd Wright. The time period covered was about the time when he met Maymah, (married, mother of two) and the years they were together, up until she and her children, and four others were killed by a deranged servant. Even though it was classified as fiction, the author did much research on the life of FLW, and followed his life events faithfully.  The author paints a vivid picture of their love affair, his leaving his wife and 6 children in Chicago, his houses and designs, and their time in Europe.
B000AP04FG|5.0|I thought this movie was very enjoyable from the start.  The on-camera chemistry between Brad and Angelina was evident and lent a lot to the believability of the movie.  Who else could be a decent enough match for Laura Croft herself?  Awesome premise and executed very well.  It is a witty allegory of married life in contemporary America.  I don't own a gun, but could totally relate!  My only complaint is the `all girl' agency Mrs. Smith worked for, it was a bit too \\"Charlie's Angels\\".
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is probably one of the best documentaries with a movie like tempo keeping you glued to your seats. The narration & music are rivetting.    Plus the additional pieces on the \\"behind the scenes\\" shots are excellent and shows the difficulty & patience involved in shooting these marvellous scenes.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|I have a big problem with the Chao. I can listen to his songs forever without getting tired. If they were on the old vinyl, it would have worn out on me a million times.<br />This new album is more acoustical and melodic than previous releases, but his lyrics have also achieved more richness and depth. Clandestino and Esperanza are still the most played of my library, this will get the first spot....and please Manu, let's not wait another 6 years.
630512762X|4.0|who doesn't like this movie. i can't believe people would give it a low rate, what the...? oh well, you can't win them all. back to the important stuff. this movie is truly a movie of greatness. two of the industries GIANTS go head to head in this action packed story. what better reason are you going to need to watch this than having john travolta and nicolas cage together. all the action and super movie was just a bonus. there couldn't have been a better idea than to make this film. travolta is one of the greatest actors ever, and this is just another huge step to achieving success. cage is another, who brings his own to this movie. he is terriffic, and knows what he's doing. this is natural to him. and the ability to change roles is what makes them two of the best in the industry. legends like these are hard to come by. the plot is they both hate each others guts, but in an attempt to save the city travolta must become cage, and vice versa, but...things do not go as planned, and all hell breaks loose. cage takes charge in travoltas' body, and nobody will believe travolta in cages'. someone must come out on top, and may the best man win.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is one of the best bands today - standing high above the dull I IV V repetitive progressions and whiny \\"singers\\", mindless thrash and talentless garbage that clutter the rock/metal genre.  They are a diamond in the ruff.  Always testing limits, always making music like no other.    A number of factors add up to make this band almost perfect.  For one, they have one of the best rhythm sections of any metal/rock band today - Justin Chancellor on bass and Danny Carey on percussion.  These two musicians are outstanding enough on their own, but locking in tight to create not only solid rhythmic structure but also almost melodic sonic texture in the background makes them unstoppable.  Listening to The Pot, Jambi, Rosetta Stoned, or Vicarious makes it clear just how advanced these two are.  Adam Jones, on guitar, is a perfect blend of metal and ambience, melody and rhythm.  His solos, while not the shredding you would expect from a metal band, are emotive and powerful, and his harmonies with Justin are nothing short of brilliant.  Maynard James Keenan, the vocalist, has an incredible vocal range, and his enigmatic lyrics and musical arrangements give a fresh, unique sound to their music.  Another thing that sets them apart is their use of odd time signatures and phrases, which are often quite complex and give a much looser feel to their songs, as they are not afraid to step outside the bounds of strict 4/4 to get the sound they are going for.  The first two songs are mainly in 5/4 and 9/8, respectively, yet they are able to make these odd times feel natural and not forced.    There are several songs on this album that shows their brilliance (I will give commentary on a few that stand out):  -Vicarious: A solid opening piece that carries an important social commentary, with one of the best endings on the album.  -Jambi: Truly incredible, this masterpiece almost entirely takes place in 9/8, and what's more, Danny divides each measure into 3 beats, while Justin and Adamdivide them into four and a half - this creates for some MAD plyrhythms and syncopations, yet it all comes together perfectly with all parts doing their thing.  Most other bands would end up with a trainwreck - not so here.  And the whole arrangement is awe-inspiring, from the bass to the drums to the guitar to the lyrics.  -Wings of Mary (Parts 1 and 2): These two songs have a radically different structure compared to most other songs.  Part 1 is slow and emotive, Part 2 continues this and builds and builds in intensity - the musicianship in this one is outstanding.  Words can't really do it justice; just lay down on the floor in the dark, put on some headphones, and listen to these two songs for an experience you'll never forget.  -The Pot: While this is one of the only songs that takes place mainly in 4/4, it is nonetheless quite technically impressive.  The bassline is pure genius, and Maynard's surreal lyrics make you wonder if the title had anything to do with the song's conception.  -Intension: This isn't a song, but more of a transitional piece and an intro into Rosetta Stoned.  -Rosetta Stoned: Perhaps the most chaotic and diabolical song on the album, this beast goes through several phases, changing time signatures often and switching moods and tones.  Brilliantly executed, Justin and Adam have many off-timed counterparts that seem to float away on their own yet are tethered to the essense of the song by Carey's lines.  Sounding like a dream at some points, and a nightmare at others, this is one surreal-as-hell piece that makes use of every second of its 10-minute-plus length.  The solo section is perhaps the most powerful moment.  Once again, no one element stands out here - it all weaves together to complete the mood.  The diabolical-sounding bassline in the background (locking in with the drums) accentuates the slow, emotive and distorted guitar melody.  As it progresses, the force of Justin's playing increases to match the darkening mood of Adam's playing.  A work of genius.  -Right in Two: I'm out of creative words to describe things right now - suffice to say that this song is brilliant as well.    To sum it all up, if you're looking for a change of pace in music, something to get you away from the repetitive themes of many of today's rock bands, this is an ideal buy.  If you're new to Tool, this is a great album to start off with, and you will not regret it.  Just keep in mind that this is very different from what you normally hear, so don't get put off by its new flavor.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|In my opinion this movie along with Vampire Hunter D are the BEST anime ever done to this day.  A must have for anyone's collection.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|You have to enable the closed caption, it is called \\"CC1\\".<br />Works in WinDVD 8.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Great movie, with great soundtrack, would of liked to of heard it remastered though.  Hot chick, Arnie, whats not to like?!
0066620996|5.0|I've heard it said that Good to Great by Jim Collins is the best-selling business book ever and now I understand why! I was so gripped when I started to read \\"Good To Great\\" that I devoured 150 pp the first night! It's extremely readable and accessible to all. The book is also painstakingly researched but most of all it's inspiring. There are many times I've doubted myself and what I'm trying to achieve in my job, but the book makes it clear that real breakthroughs come through hard work and from pushing that flywheel constantly.   The flywheel is an analogy to instigating change within an organization; at first it's hard to move, but after many small, regular pushes, it gets going and then becomes next to impossible to stop. Collins states: \\"Good to Great comes about by a cumulative process - step by step, action by action, decision by decision, turn by turn of the flywheel that adds up to sustained and spectacular results.\\" Collins' research substantiates this. The media focuses on the spectacular returns of these companies but only after they're well on their way to stardom. All the painstaking work that's gone into their transformation isn't covered by the media.        This book has a lot in common (surprisingly) with one of my favorite books: How to Create a Magical Relationship by Ariel and Shya Kane. The Kanes discuss their Principles of Transformation, which are incredibly useful and potent. In fact, the use of the word 'transformation' by Collins is what caught my eye: \\"Some executives weren't even aware that a major transformation was under way until they were well into it. It was often more obvious to them after the fact than at the time.\\" I've experienced a very similar feeling with the Kanes' Transformational Principles.   Every choice I make just seems to be the next, natural thing I need to do. If I'm truly living my life, I'm not thinking about my life. With transformation, I'm not aware of the choices I've made until I look back. Only then do I seethat transformation had occurred. But it's exactly those moment-by-moment choices, in which I am being there for my life that makes transformation possible. Just like those senior officers at the various companies that are executing on their strategies, day-by-day, spinning their flywheels, the Kanes' revelatory book enables me to start spinning my own personal flywheel.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|First off, the movie is great and it's one of those movies that must be seen in theatres or at least in HD/Blue-Ray to truly appreciate.  It's gorgeous to look at and the action sucks you into the movie.    My comments are more about the Blue-Ray format for this movie and in general.  I feel Sony needs to step up and give us a bit more for the money.  There are two-discs versions and super duper reextended quadruple edited versions of this film and many others.  But when it comes to the Blue-Ray, nothing.  Not even an insert in the case with the chapters, film info, actors, nothing.  For the money we pay for these movies, I think they can put a little more content into the discs and the packaging.  Blue-Ray should be a step up from normal DVD and even HD so, make me feel like I'm stepping up.  Give me the content in the disc and in the case.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|I grew up reading the comics of the Ghost Rider and loved it.  So, when Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes were cast in this, I was less than hopeful.  Didn't even see it in the theatres since I was expecting something along the lines of Daredevil, ie. a horrible adaptation serving as nothing more than a vehicle for the actors in the movie.  I gotta say, I was very surprised.  It was faithful to the comic while giving the story it's own spin.  The casting and the effects was great and they even tipped their hat to the original Ghost Rider comic which was a western.  Nicely done!    Watching this in Blu-Ray was amazing!! The colors, clarity and sound sucked you right into the movie.  I hope they make another and take full advantage of what a great character they have.  Just make him a tad darker in the next one.  I'd like to see the flaming skull head that laughs as he sears the souls of his enemies.      [[ASIN:B000OVLBIU Ghost Rider (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray]]]
006088732X|5.0|This was such a good book! I loved how I could sympathize for the characters, and the element of mystery... What happened to Alison? Who is A? Now I'm hooked, and I think I'm definitely going to enjoy reading this series.
0141182601|5.0|I've been on a little reading binge lately, and I found this book to be quite exilerating.  I have never read anything like it!  I would have to say that this is one of my absolute favorite books.  I am so happy that they decided to publish the last chapter of this book in the States.  It would be completely different without it!!      I would recommend this book to anyone, I checked it out from the library for the first reading.  I am going to have to add it to my collection, that's how good it is!
B000002GJS|4.0|I grew up listening to this cd nonstop. I bought at least five tapes because they'd keep on breaking. I recently pulled the cd out of my collection while ripping some files onto my MP3 player. I still remember all the words to the songs but the cd is a bit cheesey to me now. Its funny how everyone I know hates Bryan Adams but I love him. His early stuff was better. Still though, a great rock album.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Can be viewed with the family.Cute movie about Beatrix Potter. It is the story of her life shortly before she became famous. The hardship of being an unmarried woman and a writer is told in good fashion. It is not a complete story about her though. I think it could be labeled as a mid-section of her life. It is kinda long and slow but worth seeing.
B000002GGU|5.0|While Adams is an after thought these days, he still put out great music in the 80's. I really enjoy this cd and everyone song on it was basically a hit for Adams. If you like rock music then there is no reason why you'd hate this cd.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Saw the first episode and wasn't able to see the rest.Very good writing and actors.
B000RJO578|3.0|I couldnt wait to see this movie. I bought it and watched it right away. I was expecting some great things considering these guys made Shaun of the Dead. The first half hour flew by and I was bored. No real laughs just a typical movie. When he movies to the new town, there are a few laughs scattered thru out by it was disappointed. I love horror movies and I was surprised at how gory this movie was. It kind of reminded me of Broken Lizards. They released an amazing film, Super Troopers, then followed it up with a horror comedy that was bad, Club Dread. While these men did make a horror comedy that is probably one of the best ive ever see, this was suppose to be an action comedy. The ending of the movie was pretty sweet though.
B000PY30JE|5.0|This is the most satisfying and, in many respects, most representative Chet Baker I've come across. No vocals, nothing even approaching bebop. It's truly bicoastal and genre-resistant music. Moreover, it doesn't have the sponginess of some later Baker sessions with electronic synths and reverb assists. These are beautiful deconstructions of familiar pieces, each slowed to a tempo-less, non-insistent, seductively langorous meditation--a sigh, a whisper, a breath of spring (and autumn).<br /><br />The presence of Pepper Adams' slightly abrasive baritone is just enough seasoning to keep it interesting. The tastefulness of Miles Davis' rhythm section (Bill Evans, Chambers and Philly Joe) is, on this date, merely more testimony to Miles' good instincts when it came to picking players.<br /><br />We are living in a milieu that, if not apathetic, is positively hostile to the ballad.  Even the paragons of the form--Sinatra's \\"concept albums\\"--are languishing in a world in which human beings fly about like like carrier pigeons with iPod buds in their ears.  If that's your world, you won't want to have anything to do with Chet's--or the exquisite music on this album.
B00005R1N3|4.0|I thought the movie did a pretty good job. The phone calls always gave me chills and I liked that the killer was rarely seen. I always felt like I was trapped in the house with the killer and tried to get out. The middle does drag a little and I didnt like the ending all to much. There is not alot of gore but it was still well done. I highly recommend it to people who love horror movies.
0060512806|5.0|I have read this book three times and purchased a new (used) copy each time.  I don't currently have a copy because this book is too good not to give away.  S. is a true wordsmith with a wonderful way of showing you the many intricacies (sp?) of english and causing you to think.  A great thing for a book to do!  It is the sort of book you wish would continue long after the final page due to your involvement with the characters.  Truly engaging and a worthwhile read; once, twice or a half dozen times.  For anyone who enjoys english, philosophy, laughing, mathematics, logic, or a well written book.  I can't praise it enough!
B00000K3G8|5.0|Some bands suck live. Some bands sound just like they do on cd. Some bands add a little extra so you know your hearing something speical. Talking Heads add a little extra and more. If you listen to Talking Head cds, you'll notice most songs are calm. This cd takes all there popular songs and makes them rocking. I love the versions of Once in a Lifetime (reason why I bought this cd), Swamp, Burning Down the House, and Take Me to the River. The only down side is the Tom Tom Club's song Genius of Love. It just seems out of place on this cd. I also own the dvd and thats pretty amazing to watch. I highly recommend this concert to any music fans out there who enjoy a band thats a little different.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|Scarface is overlong, excessively vulgar and violent.  I agree that this movie has been influential, but for all the wrong reasons.  Many gangster rap groups, most notably the Geto Boys, used many soundbites from Scarface throughout their career to accentuate their bravado or \\"hardcore attitude toward life.\\"  It's a shame that De Palma convinced so many talented people to waste their time with this gutter trash.  Howard Hawks' Scarface is still superior in every way.
B00000K0DV|5.0|New York Ripper is very different from Fulci's other movies and is kind of a return to his giallo/slasher roots. It is known for being Fulci's most depraved and violent movie, especially towards women. It is a very strange and dark slasher filled with sex and sleaze that takes place in New York and is up there as one of my favorite Fulci flicks.<br /><br />The cinematography and story are excellent in this one, and even though the thought of a killer with a duck voice is kind of cheesy, there is a very good reason for it and I think it's pulled off really well. I really can't understand all the bad reviews for this one, I think it's one of the best giallo/slashers I've ever seen and deserves a way higher rating then 3 stars.<br /><br />Gore includes, but is not limited to......vagina slashing, nipple slashing, eyeball slashing, stomach slashing, booby slashing, slashing, slashing and more slashing.<br /><br />There is also some soft-core thrown in for good measure, full female frontal nudity and one scene (my favorite scene) involving a toe and a womans private area.<br /><br />If your a hard-core Fulci fan like me, I suggest you look past the negative reviews and pick this one up, you will not be dissapointed.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies.  It is a wholesome love story, based on the life of Beatrix Potter and her \\"bunny story\\" plus others. The setting is 1902 with crisp, beautiful city and country scenery. Miss Potter is not happy in settling with a husband selected by her mother and maintains her independence, being happy in her drawing and writing. When her first book is accepted for publication, she meets the love of her life Norman Warne (Ewan McGregor), her publisher. Of course, Miss Potter's mother doesn't view him as acceptable and wishes that her daughter wouldn't bring trades people into their home and the story unfolds.  The actors are great. I recognized some actors from another favorite - Lorna Doone. You won't want to miss the song that Ewan McGregor sings, when he is teaching Renee Zellweger to dance. Beatrix Potter gave 4,000 acres of land to the people of Britain when she died, saving it from developers. The only negative that others who have seen the film have to offer is that some have a problem with Renee Zellweger's facial expressions and find them distracting.  I didn't find this to be a problem for me and loved all of the expressions.
1400063515|2.0|Much of the material is valid and enlightening; things you should really know. Sadly, the maner of presentation was too difficult for me to bear. On nearly every paragraph, the author wants to tell you that he is enlightened and everyone else is foolish. The anectodes about life in Lebanon and jokes about Frenchmen were amusing but distracting. The author's overly frequent references to himself made it hard for me to focus on the topic at hand.
B00000JG41|5.0|Like others have said, this is the most \\"mainstream\\" work by Mr. Bungle.  The songs on this album are infectiously catchy and will stay lodged in your cranium for days on end.  It's hard to describe this album in words, but all I can say is that if you're new to Mike Patton or Mr Bungle, this album is a must-have.
1416500294|5.0|Treasure Island is perhaps THE classic pirate's tale.  Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins.  Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village.  When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge.  I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.      Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart.  Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection.  The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers.  The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.      In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic.  It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well.  I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone.
6304698623|5.0|I have absolutely adored this film since I first saw it at the age of 8, and it thus holds that special place in my mind, as a sort of magical and daydreamy tale. Upon renting it again recently, I was pleased to find that the cinematography still remained impressive and the stylization and story still highly engaging. Though it may be a tad overacted,I think the general message of the story still shines through. I imagine that it's not solely about deserving to be a \\"bratty princess\\", but more about building a sense of personal self-worth and realising that everyone is entitled to be treated as, well, a human being, regardless of form or status.    I personally would not listen to the naysayers, whom are namely book purists, and unable to appreciate the film in and of itself, as opposed to just a \\"butchered\\" extension of the book; as if simply reading a novel entitles you to suddenly become an expert on anything whatsoever. Please look past the minute differences in detail and recognize the film for its worth on its own.
B000OONTFU|5.0|The best movie ever in HIGH DEF! You couldnt ask for more .. well maybe another matrix movie .. hehehe!
B00005MAM2|4.0|Members of a motorcycle gang in the dystopian metropolis of Neo-Tokyo become involved with a powerful psychic force and the governments agents who seek to control and exploit it.  \\"Akira\\" has been hailed as a watershed in the history of anime.  I don't know enough about the genre to evaluate it on that level, but I can certainly testify to its power as spectacle.  Though made in 1988 using traditional animation techniques, it equals or surpasses anything made today, including the current plethora of CGI productions.  The images and backgrounds are detailed, the movements are smooth, and the story is apocalyptic enough to provide a suitable foundation for such incredible visuals.  The script is mostly successful as well, but the resolution that I so eagerly anticipated turned out to be incomprehensible metaphysical gobblety-gook.  Though that prevents it from attaining 5-star status, it remains an impressive achievement and a must-see film for animation fans.
0446364495|5.0|First I would like to say that although this book is fiction that I believe it is based on a true story, which I feel really makes a difference.  If you are looking for a fast paced or even moderately paced book of action you won't find it here.  But the depth of emotions and real to life decisions made within it are packed full. Those who have not encountered this type of emotional confusion or who are looking to be entertained will probably not like the book much and find it slow, unrewarding and frankly boring.  HOWEVER, those who seek meaning in life, who wish to understand love, commitment and their own emotions will likely love it.  This book, to the contrary of some reviewers, does not endorse adultry as evidenced in the final decision made by the characters.  Though those seeking only to look on the surface may disagree with me.  It is true that the book identifies the deep passion of the two main characters with great splendor and erotica.  Nevertheless, it also shows the deep pain the characters contended with as a result.  The main character waxes and wanes through a difficult choice.  If the reader is reading the book quickly to reach the \\"excitement\\" he will fail to catch the real excitement in it.  This book needs to be read like a slow sunday drive or a quiet walk through a park.  Take your time, FEEL the characters emotions, and you will find the book very rewarding.  Bridges of Madison County leaves the moral judgements up to you.  Is this a book endorsing adultry or is this a book about love, commitment and in the end the sanctity of marriage?  I was personally left with the feeling that one should not jump into marriage, but wait until the \\"certainty\\" is there.  That the job of a parent does come before your own wants and needs.  And finally that, although there is adultry displayed here, the truth is, it also makes clear that marriage is what YOU make it, and that no matter how great you think the new relationship would be it could never survive the guilt and betrayal it would take to possess it.  Therefore, we ask ourselves, why go through all that pain for something that really could never be?  Franchesca shows us that it isn't love alone that makes a marriage good. We learn how important and romantic life's details, such as laundry, are. I personally believe it helped me to better understand all the facets of marriage, outside of the romance novels. We are never led to believe that her marriage is a bad one, just that her affair was a paradise turned into an emotional hell (granted one she says saved her life, but that the reader can also clearly see destroyed her life).  In the end we find ourselves yearning to bring the lovers together, yet we also find ourselves feeling admiration for her decision to stay and put her own feelings a side.  In addition it even provides us with what would be a true to life emotion of feeling as if she were a fool to pass it up.  Truely we learn about what absolute commitment is, and how with that, any marriage is solid as a rock.  This book should shout volumes on the seriousness of marriage and family, something all too often taken much to lightly.  It also creates in us a desire to recreate what the lovers share within the confines of our own relationships, hopefully inspiring us to spice up our own marriages.  Those with deep sentimental emotions will find this book awakening, true to life's sins, and morally enlightening! I've read it and seen it many times.  Scenes dealing with their emotional tug of wars still makes my heart race as if it were a car chase. As with everything in life, it's all in what you expect.  Expect little in life and you will usually be pleasantly surprised!the guilt and betrayal it would take to possess it.

B000J4QWMC|3.0|Michael Mann has become the undisputed master of the police procedural/crime film with gritty films like Heat and Collateral. Miami Vice fits well into his catalogue. The resemblence to his 1980's television show is in name only. The show gave us pastel colors and attitude and made stars of Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. The film is gritty and dirty looking and takes us inside the lives of deep undrcover operatives.    The plot has been done many times before: undercover cops must take down drug lord but remain true to themselves. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell manage to do quite well with the material they are given. Some of the dialog is mumbled and the story gets too complicated at times for its own good but this is a surprisingly well made and well thought out film. An excellent commentary track my Mann gets into the nuts and bolts of the filmaking process and the casting choices. Into the usual mix is thrown a romance with one of the drug lord's women expertly played by Gong Li. Her acting is one of the highs of the film.    Bottom line is if you are looking for a standard reprise of the television show this is not the film for you. But if you are looking for a more realistic, gritty crime thriller check it out. You may be pleasantly surprised.
0345404475|5.0|Really I don't know what I can add that hasn't already been said about this fantastic book. A must read for even non-sci-fi fans as it could be the book that converts you to the genre!
B0002I831S|4.0|I grew up with reruns of the original series, in the 1970's and 1980's. It was terrific television. My fondness for this show grew as I got older when I could appreciate the writing and the characters even better. This series was something special. It raised questions and issues that other shows wouldn't even dream of doing. It had moral fiber and decent principles. It explored philosophy, horror, comedy, and psychology. Not since The Twilight Zone had their been a comparable television production.<br /><br />This program is one of the most popular and beloved in American television, so I assumed the dvd sets would be worth getting, naturally. After all, the fans are legion and the show has been, and still is, immensely loved by millions. It is so wonderful to have access to these episodes at my leisure. I don't need to bother anymore with the edited/butchered reruns on cable, with its endless commercials, and stupid pop-ups at the bottom of the screen. That is a sweet, beautiful thing.<br /><br />One drawback: the case and packaging of these sets is a bit ridiculous. Some people will probably like it because it seems fun. But to me the packages look as though they were only designed to look appealing while sitting on the shelves at BestBuy or Walmart. At one's home, they lose their appeal immediately. First there is the silly outer plastic 'shell', revealing a paper sleeve which covers the inner 'book' case. It's all a bit too much. Sometimes simpler is better.<br /><br />Now, I do understand that thousands of these sets had to be manufactured, and economics is an issue. But surely a dvd show that's this beloved (and this expensive considering the suggested retail pricing) was worthy of better, more sturdy packaging. The flimsy, clear plastic disc holders will not last long; unless handled with extremely meticulous care they will fall apart like pages from a book with crumbling binding.<br />The rounded, brightly colored case (which looks cool at first) is highly impractical and really a bit stupid when you consider it. Paramount should have done better by Star Trek.<br /><br />Also, (it's not crucial in the least but) a \\"Play All\\" feature would have been nice on each disc. Sometimes it's nice to have the entire disc play automatically.<br />The episode guide has the smallest print you could ask for.<br /><br />I have no other issues with the dvd's. Image is fine for me. Menus are cute, as I expected.<br /><br />This show is a piece of television history and a big chunk of nostalgia from my youth. Hence the four stars. But the box and disc holders just don't satisfy me. A small issue but I just thought I would mention it.stupid when you consider it. Paramount should have done better by Star Trek.

B000NDI3SK|5.0|Bronowski's passion is obvious in this series and his understanding of \\"the big picture\\" and how mankind's own tenacious spirit propelled us to where we are today.    His narrative is informative and philosophical.  I believe Carl Sagan used Bronowski's own passionate style in making \\"Cosmos\\" a few years later.    I was \\"told\\" to watch this show in my Junior year in high school and I, being a typical 16 year old, watched it as ordered by my English teacher.  I fell in love. It made history a vital part of my own life and perspective.      I've anxiously awaited this series on DVD for years and now it's here.    Thanks!
0451191153|4.0|Having heard that Rand was the poster-child for unrestrained capitalism, I wanted to read The Fountainhead with a mind to hate Rand. When I finally had an opportunity to buy a used copy, a 50th Anniversary Edition, it was shamelessly full of in-my-face self-promotion and Ayn Rand marketing hype. Before I could even begin to read the story, she had two-strikes against her.<br /><br />Inexplicably, I found myself liking the story, and even appreciating what Rand was trying to tell the reader through the voice and actions of her characters. It was also a fun read, a page turner for at least the first 400 pages. And, while there was a lot of tedium in the last 200 pages, the story climaxed fruitfully at the trial. I was climbing walls during Toohey's God-awful monologue in Peter Keating's apartment.<br /><br />At extremes of believability in the four or five main characters, there was Wynand on the believable end of the spectrum, and Toohey on the list of the century's least believable characters of any novel. I felt that Rand had to satirize the Collectivist in order to scapegoat him. Ellsworth Monkton Toohey wasn't just satire, he was a caricature.<br /><br />Keating, Roark and Dominique each had their shining moments, but Roark's didn't come until the end: Once, when Keating sold his dignity (yet again) for the Cortland Homes, and also at the trial. Before those flourishes of verbosity, it was as if Roark was unable to speak in complex sentences. If you had to ask yourself honestly, how was Roark any different from an idiot savant, you wouldn't be able to show that he was.<br /><br />Though her characters wouldn't necessarily behave like people you or I might know, Rand used them effectively to teach her little lesson about where America seemed to her to be going. As for character types, I know Peter Keatings and Ellsworth Tooheys. My disgust for some of these people in my own life actually came into focus after reading The Fountainhead.<br /><br />And, each of us have seen the bad and ugly side of capitalism, but compared with the prospect of losing individuality, creativity and the purity of our own excellence, I guess it is an idea worth defending. This review comes a day after reading that Osama is telling all Americans we must convert to Islam, and only then will he stop terrorizing us. Pause for thought.<br /><br />The Fountainhead was predictable at every step of the way. I found myself saying, \\"Keating will stab this guy in the back and get his job,\\" \\"Keating is going to ask Roark to do his work,\\" etc, from start to finish. There was one event I didn't know how it was going to turn out, and that was what defense Roark was going to use at his trial, and the trial's outcome. But, even Guy Francon, Dominique's father kind of gave that away when she and he were talking over the phone. That defense, by the way, seemed rather brilliant to me. First, it explained satisfactorily why Roark did what he did; second, it was a genius bit of psychology to cause the jurors to think of themselves as Creationists and not Collectivists. Put in those terms, who could refuse?<br /><br />Ironic that the Second-hand Man was so reprehensible to Roark, and yet he ended up marrying a second-hand woman. I conclude the whole dysfunctional relationship with Dominique could only be explained as Rand's sexual fantasy. After all, look at Roark: The strong, silent type. Red hair, sweats a lot, full of testosterone. Look at his antithesis, Toohey: diminutive, doesn't engage in anything physical, 100-percent cerebral.<br /><br />If you can read The Fountainhead as a novel without getting carried away by the Ayn Rand philosophy merchandising, then there is no reason why it should not be an enjoyable, educational read.<br /><br />Incidentally, I recently got to see some of Rand's world played out in real life. Two camps of people were promoting a new town flag, or condemning its artistic merits. The against side were invoking some pretty specious accusations, ones that seemed they couldn't substantiate, when questioned. A third man walked into the conversation from off the street. \\"Very nice,\\" he said, making a statement of his own, without asking anyone what he should think. Later, another woman was asked, and she looked from face to face, unable to form an honest opinion all by herself. \\"I don't know, what am I supposed to think? Am I supposed to like this, or not? I'm  not a history expert.\\"ird man walked into the conversation from off the street. \\"Very nice,\\" he said, making a statement of his own, without asking anyone what he should think.

B000SO7OM0|5.0|A truly remarkable concert! After a very difficult and stressful week, I got this CD/DVD package in the mail, smiled, and, with surprising calmness, walked to the living room, slid the DVD into my MacBook Pro, parked my Sennheiser HD-485 headphones on my ears, and sat back, letting the visceral experience of this incredibly talented woman wash over me, taking the stresses of the week away and reminding me how important smart, beautiful, heart-felt, literate music is to my spirit.    I've long been a fan of Loreena, yet had never seen her in concert. I was blown away by her multi-instrument acumen, her almost effortless singing while reaching those crystalline, soaring notes that reach through me and make my nerves tingle up and down my spine, her rapport with the very talented band, and, most of all, that serene smile that creases her face as her body sways with the rhythm that demonstrates how much the music carries her to a profoundly peaceful, quietly joyful place.    It's a bit embarrassing, me gushing on and on like this, something I so rarely indulge in. Yet this music, this musician (and the talented, delightful band supporting her), this production, the setting... They warrant this kind of effusive praise. Even with all of her CD's in my library, this addition is not superfluous nor extravagant: it is, in fact, essential to see the whole of Loreena's remarkable talent, heart, and unique sound.    I'm not terribly enamored of the happy-happy/bliss-bliss affectations of much that is categorized as \\"new age\\", particularly those individuals who purport to \\"channel\\" ancient spirits, while I can't help but speculate that some artists do indeed channel the vibrations, or whatever you might call it, in a pure and profound way, and often in spite of themselves. Lowell George, Yo Yo Ma, Bobby McFerrin, the band Lo'Jo, and many more, among them the beloved Lorenna: music that is timeless, almost archetypal, imbued with both heart and intellect, and beautiful to listento, over and over.    Thank you, Loreena.

1596912855|4.0|If this book were a movie it would be a PG rated romance/comedy.  It is a quick read, and doesn't take itself too seriously.  I enjoyed it and am suprised at seeing so many poor reviews.  I suspect that many of the reviewers were expecting something more like Hale's previous work, but I found Austenland to be just what it is advertised to be, which is nothing like the author's other novels.  (Although I think they are superb.)  This doesn't make Austenland bad, just different.  Hale displays a quirky sense of humor, and the characters are interesting even if not all that well developed. (It is a short book.)  Unlike most romances it isn't comletely obvious in the first few chapters how things will turn out in the end. So, if you are in the mood for a clever, light, relatively clean modern romance, you'll find this a great read.

0792165020|2.0|A meandering wandering venture that transforms Ms. Highsmith's novel into a homosexual parady.  See Ripley's Game for the proper feel of the character Ms. Highsmith created.  A disappointing movie cursed by a bad screenplay and a waste of so many talented actors.
1582701709|5.0|The \\"secret\\" to The Secret is that we all have the power for potential that is greater than we realize.  What we learn in this wonderful book is how to access that power and unleash our true essence so that we draw into our lives precisely what we want and what is good for us. It makes us look at some important questions: are we destined for a certain life or can we attract it? What role does intention play? What about personal choice? The Secret helps us find the answers to these practical and spiritual questions.  An excellent \\"companion\\" read for those interested in a novel that explores the power of personal choice is [[ASIN:1892343487 Field of Destiny]]
B000QUCNP4|3.0|After years of pondering the Zodiac murders, I thought that this movie was going to bring all the pieces together by placing the final piece into the puzzle. So I was really disappointed that the final piece still leads to the person the law and writers always thought it was....But with no true ending. But it's a good movie.
B000UUF69A|5.0|I think everything in this movie was nicely presented with great editing and moved forward with a lot of grace, just as the live action films had been, but definitely with more allowance for the different scenes and effects. Mostly, I liked the story, and I think that it stands out among other animations. TMNT has all that someone would want from a story. I admit I was a little nostalgic going back to it, but it was a nostalgia I couldn't deny at the sight of this magnificent show of honor. From one scene to the next, there was no pausing to do something else, or anxiety, or any dislike for anything in it. And that's how I remember movies to be. Lately, it's just all going beserk. TMNT was a nice surprise, and it shows there are some dedicated people when it comes to movies like this. And Sarah Michelle Geller was a real surprise...she was right for this one.

B00007KWHG|5.0|Those reviewers who seem to think Frankie Valli basically was the Fours Seasons only show their ignorance. Most of the Seasons' most famous songs were written by some combination of the group's keyboardist and guitarist Bob Gaudio and/or their producer Bob Crewe and/or some of his in-house songwriters. Additionally, Gaudio and Crewe each wrote some songs in solo. Without them, you would not likely have ever heard of either Frankie Valli or what would become the Four Seasons, and even if you did, it would be for some extremely obscure songs Valli recorded in the 1950's. Furthermore, bassist and vocal arranger Nick Massi (from 1960 to 1965) was most responsible for designing the Seasons' unique sound, a fact Valli is quick to note.    That said, listen to this album and be born again. Or discover the Seasons for the first time, and do listen to more than just \\"Sherry,\\" \\"Walk Like a Man,\\" or \\"December 1963,\\" like all the other shallow divers do.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I remember seeing the edited Grindhouse version when I went to go see Grindhouse on the day it came out. Finally, the full cut is being released on DVD! I must say, I loved the film to bits! Whilst not Tarantino's best, I loved it.<br /><br />STORY: While on a night of drinking and partying, a group of sexy chicks are followed around by Stuntman Mike, an insane killer. He offers one of the girls a ride home and mentions that his car is death proof, meaning that It cannot be wrecked. But as he begins to drive fast and agressive, he mentions that it's *100%* death proof, meaning that it deflects death!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: This is a major achievement in the hands of Tarantino. He nods the famous \\"75% dialogue\\" style used in his films, which works well here. And the final chase in the film, amazing!<br /><br />So see this if Grindhouse is still in theaters in your area, or see it when it comes out on DVD!
0694003611|3.0|I have all sorts of books my young one loves.  I've never really gotten her into this book.  Most books she takes right to, but this one, she hasn't really had as strong of a response to.  It's sweet, but not necessarily a necessity to every library.
B000OY8NII|3.0|I wasn't all that crazy about Eureka. This is, after all, a show from the same network that made Mansquito. However much to my surprise, the pilot was a decent start. And the premise, about a town of super-geniuses, has a tremendous amount of potential for some very interesting stories.    Others have commented on the terrific cast, so I won't repeat their praise again here. The first season seems to have been an opportunity for the writers to experiment with different premises. I don't think all the episodes premises work that well within the framework of the show. Although I'm happy to say that the show does get stronger towards the end.    If you didn't completely like the first season of Eureka (like me), then I strongly recommend giving the second season a chance. The cast have really settled into their roles, and the writing and direction are much more confident this season. Here's hoping that Sci-Fi commission a third series,  because I really like this show.

B000QEIORG|5.0|This album, simply put, is one of the pinnacles of alternative rock in the 1990's.  It added dynamics, complexity, and harmony to the raw emotion that was grunge.  And it's interesting that Grohl was a leader in both grunge and its musical evolution.  There really aren't any words or comparisons necessary for this album; it's simply a classic.  It helped set the tone for music to come and that's as powerful a statement as you can make about the influence of an album.      Grohl was famously controlling in the recording and production of TCATS, leading to Will Goldsmith's departure and soon after it's release Pat Smear's as well.  Perhaps it was this clashing that bore so much creativity, as the subsequent releases from Grohl and company are much less inspired and imaginative.  And it could be that the grief, frustration, and angst that fueled the grunge and early alternative bands had run its course.    As for the specifics of the release, it is just a bit cleaner and somewhat brighter.  The original was just a hair dark for my tastes and in comparison this one is just a hair bright.  This could be a result of a better dither algorithm or less analog treble bleed.  I'm not sure it's enough to be noticeable for most people on most playback systems.  There doesn't seem to be any noticeable distortion or compression on top of the original.    The new songs are a nice touch, enough of a reason to go out and grab a new copy if you have wore out the original.  They are better quality than MP3's floating around.  And they don't overshadow the original work, which was something I found with the Grace re-release.    Bottom line, if you don't have this album, you should.  It's at least 13 solid songs and listenable start to finish, unlike some newer albums.  And the moderate price makes this the definitive release.
B0000C16OQ|5.0|I have loved Grease since I was little and I remember singing along with the characters.  I bought the original soundtrack to the movie, but when I saw this special deluxe edition, I knew I had to buy it (I had already purchased the 25th anniversary DVD).<br /><br />I loved the fact that the first disc included songs that were not in the movie such as \\"It's Raining On Prom Night\\" and \\"Freddy My Love.\\"  These were actually two of my favorite songs from the musical, so having them here makes this CD that much better.<br /><br />I liked the Grease Megamix and the Dream Mix from the 2nd disc.  In a strange way the megamix reminded me of the end of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.  Strange, I know but I was somehow reminded of that.  Anyway, this is a great CD to add to your collection, especially if you've loved the movie either since it came out or since you first saw it on VHS.  Grease is the word!
B000R6PKP2|5.0|Based on the Blade Runner discussion panel at the recent San Diego Comic-Con, this edition should be the the last word on the Ridley Scott film, Blade Runner. The panel included the legendary director himself answering fan questions. The material on the five discs should be almost all there is, including all 5 versions like the new \\"Final Cut\\" that has the recent footage of Joanna Cassidy redoing her death scene where she barrels thru the plate class. The fan favorite \\"The Work Print\\" is also included, along with documentaries and 1 disc full of scenes. For the fans of Blade Runner, the film inspired by P.K. Dick's brilliant novel \\"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep\\", the five-disc Ultimate C.E. is a must. And it comes in the neat \\"Deckard Case\\", and Amazon has it listed at $69.99 as a pre-order. And that is the Blu-Ray version for $30 less the list price. At that price it's a steal. I just ordered mine, and I recommend any fan to do the same.
B000VAPZM2|4.0|I absolutely loved the first movie so naturally I was expecting to fall in love with this one as well.  I didn't exactly love it, but I definitely liked it a lot.  What I didn't really like was how much Troy/Gabriella (Troyella) scenes there were.  We all know that the're a couple.  That was made clear at the end of the first movie.  I thought that Sharpay was over the top at times...I liked the way she was in the first one a bit more.<br /><br />All right...now for what I liked about this movie.  I loved the fact that Lucas Grabeel (Ryan) had a storyline in this one.  He did not have enough screen time in the last one; he was basically just following Sharpay around the whole time so seeing him 'break free' (pardon the pun) from Sharpay was great.  I really liked seeing Corbin Bleu (Chad) and Monique Coleman (Taylor) more in this movie.  They actually had solos in this one!  I also liked the fact that they both danced a lot more.  The rest of the supporting cast had much bigger roles as well which I really enjoyed.<br /><br />This movie was also more dramatic than the first.  While some of it was definitely silly, it was also fun.  The dance numbers were the best in my opinion...especially What Time Is It, I Don't Dance and All For One.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good movie for kids, tweens, teens, or anyone that likes Disney...and HSM of course. :)  I recommend it to anyone who saw the first one and loved it.  Who cares how old you are...if you ask me, you're never too old for Disney.
B000RJO578|5.0|Great movie.  I may even like this better that Shaun of the Dead which is another hilarious movie.
0743496728|5.0|This is a brilliant book, one so full of valuable insights into western society.  I have a lot of unread books in this house but this one was so good I wanted to run out and buy another Jodi Picoult book straight away because I wanted to keep reading something of this high standard and quality. Normally I'm a slow reader but I couldn't put this down.  This is the first book I have read by Picoult.  It is the story of an unpopular boy's life, the community he lives in and the effects of a school shooting.  It has a rich cast of characters and we experience all their points of view.  I think the ending was superb and made perfect sense and I don't understand why some of the reviewers here missed the point. However I won't spoil the ending by saying more in this review. I just don't agree with the reviewers who found the ending a disappointment.  I particularly agree with the review who said that this can be a painful book to read if you have children in school.   Picoult does include many many details directly out of the Columbine incident, including for example the mother (of a victim) who shot herself in a gun store and the crosses on the hill, with the shooters cross being taken down again and again.  Obviously Columbine captured her imagination and she is exploring possibilities in this book but this was slightly disconcerting as having read a lot about the case it is clear that Klebold and Harris were not victimised to the extent Harris was. They made that clear in the videos they made. They were not sympathetic characters like Peter. They made it clear they just enjoyed hurting people and thought it was funny. (I'm getting this from having read transcripts of the videos.)  So this \\"explanation\\" or examination of school shootings as being a result of bullying doesn't work for the Columbine scenario but it is none the less a fabulous read.
6305736650|5.0|A great movie must have certain components: (1) great acting, (2) action, (3) humor, (4) a compelling plot, and (5) a memorable song.  This movie has all five and ranks, in my opinion, as the Best American Movie of the 20th Century.

009917961X|4.0|I enjoy reading John Grisham novels and as with his other novels, I really enjoyed the characters in this book.  This was a very good book to read and I loved the story, but didn't love the ending, hence the reason for the 4 stars.  However, if you enjoy Grisham novels, I would recommend this book to read.
B000M343BM|5.0|My husband, an ex-patriot living in Australia, loved this movie. It was worth the expense to get it changed to our format. Wish more baseball dvds were available in zone 4 format. Excellent baseball sequences with an excellent humourous storyline. Just loved it. The casting makes this movie really great.
B00009V7OR|5.0|The existence of life outside of our planet is an idea that has long captured the minds of many people. The thought that maybe their might be some other forms of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is a concept that is both alluring and somewhat frightening at the same time, mostly because no one knows what the aliens (if they exist, which I don't believe they do) would be like. In the movies there are a few instances where aliens are depicted in a benevolent manner; examples would be films like, \\"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\\", \\"Men in Black\\" (the good aliens), and even the 'Star Trek' series at times. However, the majority of the time when aliens are featured in movies they are malevolent creatures bent on our destruction, such as; \\"Men in Black\\" (the bad aliens), \\"War of the Worlds\\", and \\"Mars Attacks\\". One of the most successful entries into the alien invasion sub-genre of science fiction would be the visual effects blockbuster \\"Independence Day\\" starring Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum.    \\"Independence Day\\" begins on a day when all seemed to be normal in the world and another run-of-the-mill 4th of July weekend was upon us. However, when giant saucers begin to fill the skies above numerous big cities across the globe, everything quickly shifts from average to extraordinary. As humanity attempts to contact what is believed to be aliens residing in these giant ships, one former scientist turned cable repairman (Jeff Goldblum) discovers that these aliens are anything but peaceful, and as he warns the President of the United States (Bill Pullman), the aliens strike with deadly force. Now, with the attempted annihilation of the human race in full swing, our last hope rests upon humanity's ability to work together in the face of adversity, and on a daring mission led by a cocky pilot (Will Smith).    Here is a movie that beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely lives up to the term 'summer blockbuster'. What makes \\"Independence Day\\" such a great movieis not the fact that it is one of the best alien invasion movies ever made, of course that helps, but the mass appeal it has to such a wide audience. The film contains something for everyone; there's action, drama, romance, comedy, and of course, what would an alien invasion movie be without the prerequisite element of science fiction. All of those components when mixed together leaves audiences with an out of this world movie experience that they will undoubtedly want to enjoy time and again.    The acting for \\"Independence Day\\" was completely solid throughout, which was a pleasant surprise given the material of the movie and the fact that some of the actors aren't exactly known for their high-quality skills. Two actors that really surprised me by how good they were here were Bill Pullman as the President and Randy Quaid as a former alien abductee who's a little off in the head. Pullman surprised me because I hadn't really seen him do a whole lot of dramatic work, which was primarily his job in this film. All I'd seen of him were comedies, one was the Mel Brooks spoof \\"Spaceballs\\" and the other was \\"Casper\\", neither really tested him as an actor though, so I was surprised with how good he was in the role. And Randy Quaid, well he's done plenty of screwball comedies as wacky characters, so I knew that he could handle that aspect easily enough, but my fear was that he would ruin the movie by taking it too far into the stupid direction. Surprisingly, Randy played things with just the right amount of crazy without going overboard, and he even handled the dramatic aspects of his character, that appear later into the movie, with an earnest sincerity that was refreshing to see. Probably the biggest surprise in the movie was Will Smith's performance, though he was but one part of an ensemble cast, whenever he was on screen he made the movie his own with relative ease. I wasn't convinced that Will could truly handle a somewhat lead actor role for a big blockbuster film, since his previous movie was the highly successful actioner \\"Bad Boys\\" with Martin Lawrence carrying half the load. But once things got going, Will proved that he definitely had what it took to solidify his place among Hollywood's A-list stars, and his continuing success within the film industry is evidence of that.    Now on to the one thing that all reviews of science fiction movies require, the critique on the special effects work within the film. Top-notch special effects work is a key component to making any good science fiction movie, if you don't get the effects right and just wow the crowd, the audiences will turn on you in an instant. But for the folks that worked on \\"Independence Day\\" this turned out to not be a concern for them. The effects in this film were so top-of-the-line at the time the film was made, that most hold up very well to this day, a little over 10 years later. There are a couple of scenes that don't look so hot though, one would be the scene in which Vivica A. Fox's dog must jump into the hallway to avoid being burned alive, when the fire passes behind the dog it's a really obvious green-screen effect, of course there was no other way to do the scene, but I've seen better work done in plenty of other movies. Secondly, the scene where the alien attacks the doctors that are examining it within Area 51, the alien's movements look a little too hokey. Too much like stop-motion animation with all the tendrils whipping around, the movements felt choppy, kind of like when you watch some of the old Christmas TV shows that use stop-motion animation, the movements are fluid for the most part, but there's a slight choppiness that makes them feel somewhat awkward. But, other than those two times, I really can't come up with much else that hasn't held up from the special effects department, which is why this movie is still a favorite for many movie fans, and continues to hold its place as one of the best alien invasion movies ever made.    \\"IndependenceDay\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.
B000RJO578|1.0|I can't believe how many people loved this movie. I had all kinds of great expectations for it. I am both an anglophile, and a lover of action movies. However, I was shocked to sit this plodding and thread-bare disaster at the theatre. The story was all over the place, the \\"humour\\" wasn't funny, and it felt like noone had any idea what the movie was supposed to be about.    I had an inkling about it being a spoof of buddy cop movies, but only because people writing about it and the previews TOLD me it was supposed to be that. In my opinion, however, the filmmakers totally failed in their objective and created an unfunny and stupidly violent mess.    Yuck.
B0006B2A42|5.0|Finally this thing is out on DVD! Would have been nice to have more extras, but guess we all should be glad it's out at all.

B00008HCCF|2.0|Although young and pretty so she's nice to look at, this is another example of a DVD that really is a waste if you already own the CD with the same music. Norah is so young she really isn't much of a performer, nervous when she talks or tries to ad-lib anything.     Thus, after the first viewing, this isn't much more than a glorified CD. Neither her nor the drummer or guitarist in the small jazz combo are flashy enough to bring notice. In other words, none of the musicians are animated nor is there any noteworthy camera-work. It's mainly straight-on shots of Nora singing and playing the piano.    It's nice music and she has a calming, smooth voice but don't waste your money on this. Stick with the CD.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This movie too was wonderful. Full of magic, and excitement through and through. These movies are a must see by all ages. I've read all the books and I have been so enjoying the movies. My grand children love them too. Great work to jk rowlings for a job well done. Hate to see the books come to an end, but so worth every penny to read and see movies.   Thanks to jk rowlings for giving us these great treasures to keep and enjoy over and over.
B000M341QE|3.0|A big collection of well-known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if they will be found out.  The acting is so good it keeps you riveted to the screen.    I did get tired of all the f-words. Usually I could care less, but over 250 of them? Sometimes it seemed like every sentence. It was ludicrous and after awhile, your senses seemed bombarded with it. Every character in here is a scumbag: an untrustworthy person who will sleep with anyone and lie to everyone. Baldwin's character, as an FBI director, was the most ridiculous of them all. Both of these faults are typical for a Martin Scorcese film. Sorry, Marty, but not every person in the world is a low-life. Nonethelss, to be fair, his movies - like this one - are usually interesting, just the sordid stuff done to excess. If you can put up with the latter, you'll like this film a lot.    I do agree with the Amazon reviewers here who think it's a sad comment this won \\"Picture Of The Year.\\"

B00005JL78|5.0|This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long length of almost two- and-a-half hours, keeps ones interest all the way. Being a Steven Spielberg-directed film, it's no surprise that the photography is first-rate. This is nice-looking movie. Tom Cruise also was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).    The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not getting hit when they should, and vice- versa. The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they actually did?    I am of the opinion that this is one of Spielberg's underrated gems.
B00005JNEW|4.0|Based upon the best-selling nonfiction book of the same name, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is the story about Odessa, Texas's high school's bid for a state football championship in the fall of 1988.  The movie follows the lives of key members of the team as they begin their summer training through their season that comes to a dramatic conclusion at the Astrodome.  Odessa is a small town and doesn't offer many future prospects for the students who live there.  Most of them come from troubled backgrounds, for example quarterback Mike Winchell's (Lucas Black) mother is sick and dying and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) lives with an emotionally abusive alcoholic father.  Nevertheless, hopes and expectations are high for the Permian \\"MOJO\\" Panthers and Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton).  The town wants perfection, meaning a perfect season with a state title.  Coach Gaines wants perfection, too, but he defines it differently.  For him, perfection means giving it all; it is a way of life.  The Panthers start off the season strong, lead by Winchell and star tailback Boobie Miles (Derek Luke).  But then tragedy strikes, distilling the peace and threatening to destroy even Coach Gaines' definition of perfection.<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is one of the better team football movies that I have seen.  The action on the field is very realistic.  That is in part due to some actual footage of Permian football games that were sliced in with filmed footage from the movie.  However, much of the realism comes from the attitude of the characters.  If you've never been to Texas or Oklahoma and have never played football or personally known someone who has, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an incredibly depressing movie to watch.  The film has been made that way because FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS isn't really supposed to be about football, but it's supposed to be about the characters in the movie.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is really a movie about the friendships between a group of close high school friends.<br /><br />Yet, it is a football movie.  I never played football myself, but I generally like watching football movies.  RUDY and INVICIBLE are great films to watch.  They aren't as uplifting, but I also enjoyed ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, THE PROGRAM, and VARSITY BLUES as well as comical dramas like THE LONGEST YARD.  However, as much as I enjoy watching these films, they are nothing like real football in a small town.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is.  It's a very realistic film that illustrates how much the game means to many people and if you are connected to the sport at all, it seems a little insane.  For example, in FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS more money is spent on the football team than the rest of a school district's budget combined, the game is followed as a religion, and the biggest moments expected to happen in a person's life are during the Friday night lights of the football season of their senior year.  I realize for many people all of that sounds incredible, but in many parts of the country those things are a way of life.  Priorities might be out of line, the people might be misguided, and living like that seems incredibly depressing, but it's all very real.<br /><br />In short, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is one of the most realistic football movies ever made.  Highly recommended for football fans, citizens of Texas, anyone who read the book, and people who favor dramas scattered with a little sport action.<br /><br />A couple of trivia pieces:  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS features country singer Tim McGraw in his motion picture debut.  Also, Connie Britton who plays Coach Gaines' wife, Sharon, is also the same actress who plays Coach Eric Taylor's (Kyle Chandler) wife Tami on the television series FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.<br /><br />An extra on the DVD is the short documentary \\"The Story of the 1988 Permian Panthers.\\" This featurette is a look back at the 1988 season with some of the real life players from that 1988 team, including Boobie Miles, Mike Winchell, Brian Chavez and Don Billingsley.  Real footage from some of their games as well as television interviews and news pieces about the team are seen.  I really enjoyed this featurette. It's the best extra on the DVD.<br /><br />Other extras include the usual directors commentary, deleted scenes, a brief conversation with Tim McGraw about acting, a behind the scenes personal video entitled \\"Player Cam\\", and a comment from director Peter Berg about the reasoning why he added the scene at the burger joint.as well as television interviews and news pieces about the team are seen.

B000N3ST7A|5.0|I really can't say I am a diehard Stevie Nicks fan but I always have enjoyed a good number of her popular hits (with and without Fleetwood Mac). Her best of collection CRYSTAL VISIONS is perfect for casual listeners like msyelf. The cd contains all of my favorite songs that Stevie has done in the past and present. My personal favorite songs? \\"Room on Fire\\" and \\"Talk to Me\\" (which goth band Diva Destruction does a spectacular cover for the indie film GYPSY 83). I never really was crazy about Fleetwood Mac's music but in this case I really enjoyed songs like \\"Silver Springs\\" and \\"Landslide\\".<br /><br />In this day and age of Hannah Montana, The Pussycat Dolls, and other disposable pop tarts who tries to pass themselves off as singers, it is refreshing to hear Stevie Nicks. In my opinion, Stevie sounds as good as ever with her distinct raspy vocals which I absolutely adore. She can definitely teach the latest pop du jour on a thing or two about singing and maintaining a career that has gone on for more than the proverbial 15 minutes. CRYSTAL VISIONS is a great testament to Stevie's longevity in an industry that is more concerned with the bottom line than creating long-lasting careers for artists.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|RATATOUILLE is a Pixar picture.  That's all that one needs to know.  However, if you want some details about the film and some other (though highly unnecessary) reasons to watch the movie, keep reading.<br /><br />RATATOUILLE is a story about a French country bumpkin, named Remy (Patton Oswalt) who discovers that he not only has a nose and taste for fine food, but that he can cook great meals as well.  The only problem is that Remy is a rat.  Most people don't even like rats and since they carry and spread more diseases than almost any other animal in the world, it's not usually healthy to have one near a kitchen.  Remy finds himself literally swept away from the country to the streets of Paris.  He sneaks into the restaurant that is named and was once owned by a famous cook who Remy used to watch on tv and who believed that \\"anyone can cook\\".  Of course, no one actually believes that and after being caught, the kitchen's new scullery boy, Linguini (Lou Romano), is sent to drown Remy in the river.  Of course, Linguini can't bring himself to do it and when realizing that Remy can understand him and that he can cook, too, he brings Remy home.  A partnership is formed and the duo soon become the talk of Paris.  But the current chef and owner of the restaurant hates Linguini and smells a rat.  He tries to find out if there's someway he can keep the shining star from rising any higher, but his plans are nothing compared to the trouble that a deepening relationship between a rat and a man and the kindness that a rat shows towards his family.<br /><br />The film was written and co-directed by Brad Bird, a former animator of THE SIMPSONS and the guy who wrote and directed THE INCREDIBLES.<br /><br />You really shouldn't need any more reasons to see this movie, but I'll give you some more.  The film is mostly set in Paris and RATATOUILLE presents some of the most authentic animation of Paris ever seen on film.  If you've never been to Paris, you'll actually come away with a feel for the city after seeing the movie.  I know because I've never been to Paris and after the film some friends I know who have been there said, \\"Now you have an idea of what Paris is like.\\"  Besides Patton Oswalt and Lou Romano, the movie also features the vocal talents of Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Will Arnett, and John Ratzenberger.<br /><br />Lastly, the other reason you should see RATATOUILLE is for the water animation sequence.  Remy is separated from his family and taken to Paris by the waterways in the streams and sewers that run from the countryside into the city.  I knew I was watching a cartoon during this sequence.  I kept telling myself that over and over and over. \\"This is animation.\\"  The reason I did that is because the water looks so real.  It looked so real that there were times that it literally looks as if it is splashing off the screen.  Even if this wasn't a Pixar picture or had any of the other fine things going for it, RATATOUILLE would be worth seeing for that one sequence alone.<br /><br />Toddlers and younger kids will probably be enthralled with the colors.  Older children will probably love the physical comedy.  Adults will enjoy the story and the few allusions laid out for them throughout the picture.  RATATOUILLE truly is a picture for the whole family to enjoy and one of the best, if not the best animated film of 2007.seeing the movie.

B000QUCNOK|2.0|And again, everyone loves the emperor's clothes and how pretty all the colors are. Dustin Hoffman's career is circling down the drain much in the same manner that Robert De Niro's is, by showing up in films like this that are so utterly undeserving of his talent. If this is esteemed as a work of vision and depth, then the fix is truly in and the moviegoing public has been broken on the wheel of mediocrity- happily ingesting any substandard, contemptible feed Hollywood wishes to slop into the entertainment trough. Just because someone can recreate the streets of Paris or can CGI color a few fruits and hairdos to convey beauty and richness of experience doesn't mean that we should all clap and be awestruck. This movie is meaningless and unbelievable, a mockery of the period piece, the detective thriller, the psychosexual drama, the tortured genius expose, or any other genre it unintentionally parodies.    In politics, some say we get the government we deserve. By heaping praise on hollow window dressing like \\"Perfume\\", it looks like we will all continue to get the movies we deserve. Giving further life to this box office bomb via rentals or DVD sales is simply irresponsible. I bet the author of the book had to be restrained from going into the lot when this was filming, hoping he could find the screenwriter and sock him(and I say 'him' because I'm having trouble with the idea that an intelligent woman would countenance abetting the creation of such mindless exploitation of the fairer sex) in the jaw.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|I know this will be a great DVD. I've seen an audience tape from one of the New York shows and IT was great. David is without a doubt one of the true rock pioneers and to the fans that keep making Roger/David comments, please remember when you listen to all of the great Floyd albums that the majority of the time DAVID played (uncredited) bass on the studio albums. Listen to the incredible fretless bass work on \\"Hey You\\" from \\"The Wall\\". That is not Roger Waters. Guitar fans may recognize the strap Dave is wearing on this tour. It belonged to Jimi Hendrix, and was a birthday present to Dave from his wife. Can't wait!
0767827694|4.0|Director Sally Potter's fondly embraceable, slightly over-elaborate big screen version of Virginia Woolf's famously psychedelic tale is a moving study in the power of understatement, and a testimony to how even the most justified taking of print-to-screen liberties may sometimes come back to nip its creator. In giving the androgynous-looking Tilda Swinton (probably best known to US audiences as the White Witch in the recent Narnia adaptation) the starring role as a striking young Elizabethan lad who literally carries out his venerable Queen's command that he not age or wither, and thusly lives through the next four centuries first as a man, later after a metamorphosis as a woman, the makers of this motion picture chose well. As Orlando travels through the decades and centuries, he experiences many things. He falls in love with a fickle Russian noblewoman who is visiting the court of King James I during a winter of deadly cold; he tries his hand at poetry-writing under the guidance of a seventeenth-century con-man; the one-time male makes his entrance in the decadent eighteenth-century as a female, and reaps the consequences of this bodily change. She, Orlando, goes on to spill unexpectedly in love again in Victorian times, endures pregnant during the chaos of World War One, and finally faces a tragically unfair legal confrontation in modern times that undermines even the era-spanning authority of England's greatest queen. The film Orlando is as I said fantasy for thinkers. It sketches its story on the canvas of British history, distant and modern, and if to be dubbed unique is the high praise, then it warrants the highest praise that can be given.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Truly enjoyable movie. Thompson creates yet another memorable character. She truly excells at portraying cynical characters. Gyllenhaal's character, although not as memorable, was well portrayed. Huffman was excellent as well. And Ferrell, well, it was good. His expressions' portraying a lost sad man living a completely uneventul life won me over. The movie, as opposed to its characters, refused to fall into cynicism. It is intersting to note that the most cynic of the characters goes outside of her own self involvement to write a \\"good but not great ending\\".

B000KX0IOA|5.0|GANDHI is nothing short of a beautiful work of cinematic art.  Director Lord Richard Attenborough beautifully recounts the life of the late, great Mahatma Ghandi.  His journey as an aspiring young lawyer in South Africa is forever changed when he is thrown off of a train for being a \\"kaffir\\" (a pejorative term for dark-complected South Africans).  It was then that he realized just how biased the laws were against Indians, and, thus, began his life long dedication to non-violent protest as well as working as a proponent of the campaign to emancipate India from the oppressive British rule.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley beautifully portrays the title character and won a well-deserved Academy Award for his performance.  The cinematography is gorgeous, the supporting cast works great together as an ensemble, and the production truly honors Gandhi and his message.  This film is one of the most important historically-based biographical films out there.  See this today.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|At first glance, Taylor Swift seems like just another blonde teen singer who couldn't sell an album if the liner notes didn't include pictures. Those who don't give Swift the second glance, however, are missing out.     At only 17 years old, Swift released her self-titled debut album with a hit single, \\"Tim McGraw,\\" right out of the gate. A reminiscent ode to a past summer love, \\"Tim McGraw\\" certainly has some help from immediate name recognition and a universal theme of young love, but Swift's other tracks prove that she can more than hold her own in the country music industry.     A perky, spicy mélange of songs awaits listeners who pop in the disc. Each track is written at least in part by Swift, and many contain lyrics that showcase a maturity beyond her years. In \\"Tied Together With a Smile,\\" Swift reaches out to a friend who is drowning in her own insecurity and self-doubt. \\"Cold as You\\" lashes out at a former love with brutally honest lines such as \\"and you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.\\"     However, not every track is quite so profound. \\"Picture to Burn\\" is a playfully angry tune that threatens an ex-boyfriend, \\"go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy, that's fine; I'll tell mine you're gay.\\" The upbeat closing track \\"Our Song\\" relates the joys of a carefree young relationship to a tune that listeners won't soon forget.     Granted, Swift's album may not be the music of choice for all country fans. \\"Taylor Swift\\" is in many ways the musical equivalent of a chick flick, clearly targeted toward adolescent females who can identify with many of the messages contained in the songs.     For those who understand the emotions behind the lyrics, though, the album is like reading back through a personal diary. The words, combined with the catchy melodies, are a winning match, perfect for the music library of any country fan who wants an album that feels like a slumber party conversation with a best friend.
B00004T0US|5.0|It is hard to believe that thirty years have passed since Elvis Presley left this earth and yet it seems he is still here.  No musical personality has left such an indelible mark on his fans, on music and society in general as has Elvis.  This is especially remarkable in that I was never an Elvis fan when he first emerged in 1955 but some years later, in 1960, I bought an album by the Johnny Mann Singers entitled BALLADS OF THE KING as I had heard it played endlessly on the radio and loved every interpretation of the \\"king's\\" many beautiful ballads.  I became a fan at that time and although my roots are big band, Sinatra, the Four Freshmen and Count Basie, I do in fact love, respect and admire the King Of Rock N' Roll and what he has contributed to great American pop music.  Being tagged the King Of Rock N' Roll is almost a misnomer for Elvis was a classic balladeer, crooner, blues, ragtime and gospel interpreter.  His voice was as good as Crosby's and Martin's, whom he admired and no other \\"rocker\\" could match his clarity, range and emotion.  The only two who come to mind are Gary Puckett and Roy Orbison.<br /><br />This album, MOODY BLUE, is without a doubt one of my favorites.  It displays the emotive and plaintiff side of Elvis and clearly paints the picture of a man who is sad, somewhat depressed and aware of some mistakes he has made in his personal life.  Except for the \\"live\\" 'LIL DARLIN, the entire contents of the combined \\"twofer\\" of MOODY BLUE and LIVE FROM ELVIS PRESLEY BOULEVARD  is Elvis at his most emotional and vocal best.  His live UNCHAINED MELODY, recorded four months before he died, is classic.  HE'LL HAVE TO GO, SHE STILL THINKS I CARE, IT'S EASY FOR YOU, NEVER AGAIN and BITTER THEY ARE THE HARDER THEY FALL all prove that Elvis sang Country better than any male Country singer with the exception of Jim Reeves.  Elvis' SOLITAIRE is simply the best version out there and I'LL NEVER FALL IN LOVE AGAIN supercedes Tom Jones' version.  All in all I ratethis a strong five stars and highly recommend it to any Elvis fan who may have missed it or just to any lover of great emotional Country singing.
0385338694|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's novel, The Undomestic Goddess, is a formulaic but fun-filled twist on Kinsella's previous stories. Firmly in the chick lit genre but possessing more wit and laugh-out-loud humor than most others in that category, The Undomestic Goddess can most closely be compared to Kinsella's other books, including her first and most well-known novel, Confessions of a Shopaholic.<br /><br /> The story revolves around Samantha Sweeting, a highly driven attorney living the legal dream at one of Britain's most prestigious law firms. In line to become the firm's youngest-ever partner, Samantha is rudely booted from the company when a small filing error costs a client millions of pounds. In a panic-stricken daze, Samantha flees London to get away from the repercussions of her mistake and knocks on the door of a spacious mansion when she gets off the train several cities later.<br /><br />The couple who lives there believes Samantha is an applicant for a full-time housekeeping position and employ her on the spot before she can protest. Unfortunately, Samantha knows nothing about cooking or cleaning after years of slaving to climb the ladder of corporate success. How Samantha finds happiness, love, and the domestic skills to pull off such an undertaking is a hilarious mess of misunderstandings.<br /><br /> A former financial journalist, Kinsella is famous for her Shopaholic series and known for her endearing portrayals of clever yet slightly neurotic women. She also wrote the novel Can You Keep a Secret?, currently her only other non-Shopaholic work.<br /><br /> As always, Kinsella's skill with the written word is unparalleled in her genre. Although, like her other novels, The Undomestic Goddess follows the mishaps of a quirky young woman who digs herself deeper into her lies and cover stories before pulling through in the end, it is no less of a gem to read. Kinsella's ability to convey common thoughts that every woman has in a way that makes the reader laugh out loudnever gets old.<br /><br />While some of Samantha's ploys over the course of the novel are rather ludicrous and nearly cross the line of believability, the funny and touching writing makes up for them. Samantha is lovable as a heroine, and the supporting characters are often humorously endearing. The love plot is subdued but sweet, and Kinsella does an excellent job of weaving humor and romance together for a believable relationship.<br /><br /> Kinsella delivers another winner with The Undomestic Goddess, a predictable but never boring piece of chick lit. Sweet as cotton candy but with enough bite to hook the reader until the very end, The Undomestic Goddess is perfect for anyone who wants to put away the heavy reading and have a purely fun fiction experience.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|The entire cd is amazing. From the haunting opening track X-mas and all the way though it is a journey in itself. What the amazon review says couldn't be more off.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|Simple put...do not waste you money to line the pockets of Paramount Pictures executives...$130 something price tag is absolutely ridiculous! $60 to $70 I'd say okay, a little steep but okay, but not this....not on your life.  Especially knowing how they'll come out with some new version in 8 months time to just pillage your wallet again. No...they can keep it and I'll keep my money....especially with a recession looming.
630521610X|5.0|Scream directed by Wes Craven is still a classic, one of the few horror films that actually work as a whole. You get a few laughs, some screams and at the end you want to watch the film over and over again. Behind the original Halloween, Scream is my second favorite horror flick. Great performances by Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Aqruette and Drew Barrymore. I highly recommend this movie, it's a real scream!
B00000JPH6|2.0|The Dark Crystal is one of the movies I first saw when I was a kid. The movie has lost little of its charm over the years. I bought this version because I couldn't find the 25th anniversary version locally and didn't want to wait on shipping. The box said it had been 'mastered in HD' so I figured that meant it would look good on my 1080p HDTV. Well, I was wrong.<br /><br />The quality of the picture in this version is terrible. It looks like they used a beat up rental VHS tape to make this DVD. Random pinpoint flashes of white marr just about every scene. There are also blemishes in the form of dirt specks and floating black hairs. For a short time near the end there are even faded thin bars that slide across the screen. The credits are even slightly blurry. I had to keep reminding myself that at least this was the first time I've seen the movie in widescreen format.<br /><br />I had previously bought season 1 of the Muppet Show and it looks WONDERFUL on the same TV. So bright and vibrant, with a clear picture. Never in my wildest dreams would I have figured that a TV show from the 70s would look better on an HDTV than a movie that was 'mastered in HD'.<br /><br />Don't waste your $10 like I did... Get the 25th anniversary verison instead. I'm not sure if the picture looks any better, but it sure can't look much worse.
B00005JP5P|2.0|Film is art.  You should want to watch it over and over.  I can't say that for \\"Sunshine.\\"  The visuals are at times spectacular.  I'm amazed what 50 million will buy in cinema these days.  However, the cheaper stuff - the script, the characterizations - fall way short.  I cannot believe this movie was highly rated by professional critics.    There's a good premise, but they never give it to you, not really.  Do they think the audience is too dumb to understand?  Do they think we can't figure out it's too early for the sun to die of natural causes?  And why is this particular group selected to go?  What's their backstory?  Having floated in zero gravity myself, I'll tell you it's pretty cool, but it can also be scary and it's not for everyone.  This wasn't a \\"possible\\" suicide mission, it was a \\"probable\\" suicide mission to begin with.  And there wasn't a Ripley among them.    It would have been nice to see more interpersonal involvement.  Was I the only one who noticed these people might have different plumbing, i.e., some were boys and some were girls?  They think they're going to die and we see no warmth or tenderness among them.  One scene almost had it and it fizzled!    This film was not showing anywhere near me.  I watched a British DVD.  Again, the space visuals are breathtaking.  I questioned some of the scientific accuracy, especially with all the pre-release hype.  Also, I don't know whose idea it was to do the shaky camera thing with the bad guy later in the film, but it was very distracting and made me think the Capa character was growing funny mushrooms in that oxygen garden.  Also, those photo image flashes of the dead crew when our team boards the abandoned ship looked like poorly done subliminals.  That all seemed tacky when compared to the quality of the remaining cinematography.    What's good?  The cinematography, some acting.  What's not good?  We don't know why the sun is dying, we don't see what's happening on earth, we don't know why these people are willing to risk their lives at their young ages, we see sparse interpersonal interaction (except negative,) we never get to know the characters well enough to care about them, and script needs a lot of work.
B00005Y46O|5.0|few bands sound better live than in studio , but free live shows you don't need studio polishing to be talented. It's such a shame great bends like free didn't last but their music will be timeless. Paul Rodgers is truly the best singer ever , back then and especially now. Paul Kossof's playing will always make his spirit live forever.
B00006IRJU|5.0|The first time that i listened to Icehouse was in 1986 with \\"No Promises\\"; immediately that single struck like a lightning.    I remember quite well the first time that I listened to \\"Crazy\\", driving with a friend on a 1987 saturday night. The guitar at the begining rocked me so hard!    Well, as i have said after 20 years \\"Man of Colours\\" remains in my personal top 10. The re-issue is excelent in terms of remastering and bonus tracks. One of the best Icehouse albums without hesitation.
0525476881|3.0|Picture this: You used to be a childhood prodigy. Member of an academic game team. You excelled in school. You were special. You met a girl named Katherine and the two of you started dating.<br /><br />Then she dumps you.<br /><br />Then eighteen more girls named Katherine dump you.<br /><br />Suddenly, you're a teenager with no claim to fame except for your former status as a prodigy. No new ideas. No girl. No plans for the summer excepting wasting away in your room and moping.<br /><br />This is not your life. But it is Colin Singleton's life immediately after his graduation from high school.<br /><br />Given Colin's history with girls, you might not be surprised that John Green chose to name his second novel An Abundance of Katherines--a title that proves itself even more apt as the novel progresses.<br /><br />After sulking for several days after being dumped (again), Colin is dragged out of his room by Hasan, his best friend. Hassan is confident that the only cure for Colin's depression is a road trip. So Colin and his Judge-Judy-loving, overweight, Muslim pal head off for the great beyond that is the United States between the coasts. Their road trip stops in Gutshot, Tennessee. But the adventures don't. Hired by a local bigwig to compile an oral history of Gutshot, Colin and Hassan find themselves staying with Hollis and her daughter, Lindsey. It is in Gutshot that Colin finally has what he has always wanted, a truly original idea. Thus, Colin begins to create a theorem of love in his attempt to understand his own rocky love life.<br /><br />Most of my friends who have read this book and Green's first novel Looking for Alaska agree that his second novel is not as compelling a read. Having only read \\"Katherines,\\" I cannot make a judgment one way or the other. What I can say is that I loved the style of this book. There has been a growing trend to use footnotes in novels--notable examples include The Bartimaeus Trilogy by Johnathan Stroud, Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next novels, and Ibid A Life by Mark Dunn which is a novel written entirely of endnotes. Green continues that tradition here to good effect.<br /><br />The tone throughout is quirky, nerdy, and generally fun. I don't know that reading this novel will change any lives, but it will certainly get a lot of laughs. The best parts are, undoubtedly, the dialogues between Hassan and Colin. The guys are just so likable! In addition, Green's writing is snappy--all the better to keep the laughs coming.<br /><br />Some readers might find the name John Green familiar although they cannot say why. This year John and his brother Hank have earned a good amount of notoriety on the internet for their Brotherhood 2.0 vlog project (available on  YouTube) in which the brothers send videos back and forth each weekday in lieu of text conversation (if you're curious be sure to check out the Feb. 14, 2007 post because it's my favorite). They are really funny and seeing John Green and his brother in these vlogs makes it easy to see how Green came up with the idea for Colin Singleton.<br /><br />Like Nothing but the Truth by Justina Chen Headley, this book includes a bit of math. The \\"real\\" math behind Colin's theorem appears in the back of the book in an appendix and Green even has a website where you can use the theorem for your own relationships (if it doesn't crash your computer). Despite all of that, Green is a self-proclaimed lost cause when it comes to math. (The theorem was drafted by friend (and \\"resident mathematician\\" for Brotherhood 2.0), Daniel Biss.) I  wanted to share this for a couple of reasons. First, because I think it's great that Green is writing outside of what some might call his \\"comfort zone\\" and, second, because it should illustrate that you don't have to like math to enjoy a book that features a lot of math.<br /><br />Anyway, if you need a cheerful book with some fun, lovable characters I don't think you can do better than this book which was recently nominatedfor the LA Times Book Award in addition to being selected as a Printz Award honor book (Looking for Alaska won the actual Printz Award, just to put that into perspective).the actual Printz Award, just to put that into perspective).
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This review specifically concerns the 2 disc special edition which is one of, if not the best dvd's I have yet to see produced for the money!!!<br /><br />Yes...I liked the Broadway show the three times I saw it,but I LOVED the movie.Yes, there were alterations, as there always are, when a stage show hits the big screen.I happened to be one of the viewers who thought that the movie took the live show to another height under the direction of Chris Columbus.What is EXCEPTIONAL is disc 2 of this dvd which features an amazing two hour documentary about the development of RENT and it's composer Jonathan Larson.You will learn about Larson and his incredible journey to turn musical theatre around for the MTV Generation.Also,the characters for RENT are based out of his real life struggle as an artist and the lives of his friends.Though Puccini's LA BOHEME gives RENT it's foundation,it is Larson's life and friends that give RENT it's substance.It contains fascinating and heartfelt interviews with the original cast,family,producers and friends.You will learn about the development of RENT from it's earliest inception up to and through the making of the film.Your viewing of the film will be that much richer after seeing this wonderfully produced and insightful documentary...ABSOLUTELY FIRST RATE.It is every bit as compelling as the movie itself.Not often is there such an amount of material for the money.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This is a well produced story. The dialogue is all improvised and amazingly done. The acting is very good.     The rape scene was a bit disturbing because it seemed a bit exploitive. I also didn't like the treatment of the foreigners or how all the gay guys were portrayed as \\"animals\\" in the Rectum.     I like how the reverse chronology is used to convey a feel of being in each moment of each scene.     Monica Bellucci is brilliant.
B000TSIK14|4.0|The Scorpions put out a winner! I have not enjoyed a full Scorpions Album since \\"Savage Amusement\\". With great rockers like The Game of Life, 321 and The Cross,the album shows very well written songs. Although it is not like classic Scorpions, it does take the better elements of \\"Crazy World\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\" to make very very good album.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I havent listened to anything else since I got this, it is just short of genius, with a little crazy thrown in....perfect!!
B00000IQV7|4.0|Positive or negative audience \\"hype\\" and critical praise or thumbs down have rarely had much of an effect on me.  Audiences can often get it all wrong in my view, or all right, and so it goes as well for \\"professional\\" movie reviewers.  Most of the latter got this one all wrong in blasting it as most have.  To me however, while certainly with flaws, this movie aims straight for the heart, and gets things right more often than not.  It is both a drama and a comedy, and while there are some rather jarring cuts between the two, in the end, this film's heart (and socio-political statement) is certainly in the right spot throughout.  And more true today (unfortunately) than when it was first released or realized and lived out by the real life person upon which this is all based, \\"Patch Adams.\\"<br /><br />The fantastic opening scene and voice-over narrative by Robin Williams, accompanied by simple piano music (which swells to orchestral), introduces us to Patch (as he would later be called), a sad, depressed, self-pitying, aging young man on his way to nowhere, and to the \\"nut house\\" after a failed suicide attempt.  He \\"self-admits\\" himself to a hospital psycho ward, after having tried almost every remedy and \\"prescription drug\\" (evidenced in his bathroom medicine chest), given him by the established medical \\"industry.\\"  What he finds there, and later, and what he discovers about himself and others, remains a searing indictment of that \\"industry\\" and what is and is not considered \\"normal.\\"  Institution-wise...<br /><br />Those institutions are truly a daily, functioning contradiction.  On the one hand, hospitals and doctors have as their guiding principle (or so they say), the noblest of goals.  To treat people in need, to care for the sick and for those without the means to care for themselves, and to acknowledge that we are all basically just human beings living out our lives together in a \\"society\\" where the \\"Golden Rule\\" is actually the only one which matters.  But who, if they've been run through the impersonal, profit-oriented HMO horror that is the state of today's \\"medical care,\\" who, if they've ever spent any amount of time \\"in the hospital,\\" or fighting with cold, impersonal \\"health insurance\\" agencies and agents and unreasonable costs, would agree with the notion that \\"altruistic\\" and \\"loving\\" personal care shouldn't play a large part in any truly civilized health care \\"system?\\"<br /><br />Only but the most cold-hearted cynic about life and the sanctity of that, and those who consider the medical profession as just another \\"business,\\" could deny that increasing the \\"personalizing\\" of the doctor-patient relationship, could do anything but positive things.  Old habits and customs, old traditions and ways of thinking die hard however.  Is and was the \\"philosophy\\" of Dr. Hunter \\"Patch\\" Adams really all that bizarre or unworkable?  Or is and was it an attempt to just return to the \\"good old days\\" when a doctor would actually get his/her butt over to your house and tend to your sick child or you or a loved one, because they gave a damn?  Or \\"take your call.\\"  Or fight against the medical corporate interests that inhibit the very practice and art of medicine and healing itself?  Because it was (and should supposedly remain) their very oath to do so?<br /><br />In an early part of the film, a psychiatrist who is supposed to be \\"helping\\" Patch and at the very least, \\"listening\\" to him, fiddles around with his coffee, avoids eye contact, and eventually doesn't even hear what Patch says.  A bit later, Patch opts to dismiss himself from the institution, for the obvious reason that he's just not getting any true medical help there.  The psychiatrist, ego puffed up, tells Patch that he disagrees with the early release, and that after all, \\"he\\" is the doctor.  In a wonderful, fleeting, but finely powerful moment, Patch replies, \\"Yeah, but you suck at it.\\"  Patch says he thinks he can do better, and at a much later than normal age, applies to and is accepted into a prestigious medical school, and goes about proving that the personal touch is the most sound one a doctor can give to their patients.  He does so with humor, and various more touching serious moments, but is fought every step along the way by the university and medical \\"establishment.\\"  Patch's attempts to fight along the way, and his romantic interests and encouragements, disappointments, and eventual realizations, make up the bulk of the film.  And this real life story is nothing but an inspiration, especially to those who just know in their hearts that there is something dreadfully wrong with the American health care \\"industry, but that there just may be hope, if doctors were only to reach the awareness and enlightenment about the doctor-patient relationship that Patch did.  As both a patient and a doctor.<br /><br />While there are many missteps along the way, particularly in the often too-strident aspects of switching from drama to comedy, as well as turning from a personal story along the way into more of a broader, more philosophical and political denunciation of the university-trained and health-care \\"commerce\\" without needed cinematic transitional techniques, most of this works beautifully, and touchingly.<br /><br />The film reminded me of many of my favorite movies of the past along the general \\"theme\\" celebrating the wisdom and morality of the common, caring individual caught up in a crazy world, including \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next,\\" \\"Forrest Gump,\\" and  \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"  While admittedly over the top and bordering on pretentious at times, \\"Patch Adams\\" remains one of my favorite films of all time, despite drawbacks.  I think this movie should be required viewing for medical school students, who may not, like the critics, \\"get it.\\"  In addition, they should all have to watch it again and again until they do.  And that goes for dental students/dentists as well.<br /><br />A Golden Globe nominee for best picture in its time, and rightly so.restigious medical school, and goes about proving that the personal touch is the most sound one a doctor can give to their patients.

B00005JPQR|5.0|Sequels often run out of ideas and lose the freshness that made the original films so appealing. The Bourne Ultimatum, the third film in a triptych that began in 2002 with The Bourne Identity, bucks sequel redundancy. With the ultra-focused Matt Damon returning as renegade CIA assassin Jason Bourne, the film is an irresistible rush of action and suspense.<br /><br />Effectively building upon the familiar Bourne character, The Bourne Ultimatum borrows real-world news and expands it into an explosive story about a deep-cover CIA program led by one of the summer's great movie villains.<br /><br />David Strathairn, the recipient of an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of courageous newsman Edward R. Murrow in Good Night, and Good Luck, turns to the dark side as the arrogant and amoral boss of a CIA operation dubbed Blackbriar. He's definitely a bad guy who inspires thoughts of revenge.<br /><br />Despite The Bourne Ultimatum's political backdrop, the film is first of all a great action flick. Except for some rare moments of quiet, the action is constant and furiously visceral. The film's three-way battle consists of the CIA vs. Bourne and Bourne vs. both the CIA-sanctioned assassins (euphemistically dubbed assets) and the people pulling the killers' strings.<br /><br />A whistleblower tells a reporter for The Guardian newspaper (Paddy Considine) about Blackbriar, the blackest of the CIA's black-ops programs. Because Bourne, who's still wondering about his identity, wants to know what the reporter knows, he makes contact. A mere reporter, however, is no match for assassins who answer only to Strathairn's deep-cover operation.<br /><br />British director Paul Greengrass masterfully employs the streets of London and its Waterloo tube station as the public-filled set for one of the film's marathon chase and stalking scenes. Here and elsewhere, and without turning heavy-handed about it, the film reveals in bold print that innocent human beings are being hunted.<br /><br />The international action moves to crowded Tangier in Morocco, the site for another virtuosic action sequence involving local policemen, hundreds of extras and auto traffic. In the intimate setting of an empty Moroccan apartment, too, there's an amazingly violent confrontation between Bourne and his unyielding pursuer.<br /><br />All the while, director Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Supremacy) turns the tension high. The jeopardy that returning cast member Julia Stiles finds herself in, for instance, rises to Hitchcockian proportions.<br /><br />One of America's great actresses, Joan Allen, also returns to the series. Allen doesn't have much to do as Pamela Landy, CIA internal investigator, but she makes the best of it and her character is crucial to the plot.<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum shows that a hellacious action movie need not be mindless and only about action, fights and stunts.

B0006SSOHC|4.0|A decade ago I used to watch my fair share of horror movies, but at some point I started to have trouble finding good films in this genre. This resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of horror productions I watched each year. I am happy to say that \\"Saw\\" was reminiscent of the good old times. This is a movie that has an electrifying pace, plenty of gore, thrills galore and a clever plot.<br /><br />It all starts with two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy, rusty and generally disgusting bathroom. Between the two, there is a dead man with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. The two prisoners are clueless as to what is going on, with Dr. Lawrence Gordon being by far the calmer of the two, and Adam freaking out. Of course, at this point we are asking ourselves, what does the kidnapper want? But we do not have to wait long, and soon enough, the games begin. Adam finds a tape in his pocket, and Lawrence finds not only a tape, but also a key and a bullet. You can probably guess, but just in case, let me tell you that the key does not work on the locks that are keeping them chained.<br /><br />The point of the game is that Lawrence has to manage to kill Adam by 6 pm, or the psycho will kill his wife and daughter. At that time, we also find out that Lawrence has been a suspect in previous murders by this killer. We then get a combination of flashbacks to previous events related to this case, and the ordeal the two men are going through.<br /><br />The previous cases show us a very creative and twisted individual, who does not really kill his victims, but makes them kill themselves. In these scenes you will get a high dose of gore, so this movie is not for people that are even a little bit squeamish. If you like horror films though, I guarantee that you will be entertained through the duration of this movie and that your nerves are going to be seriously tested. There is only one reason I did not give this movie five stars; the acting. Both, Whannell and Elwes, deliver sub par performances, with exaggerated facial expressions that do not fit the mood of the film. Everything else on this movie is right on target.b par performances, with exaggerated facial expressions that do not fit the mood of the film. Everything else on this movie is right on target.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|This is a lighthearted comedy portraying the infamous Giaccomo Casanova. The whole movie was shot in Venice and the scenery is just spectacular. The costumes are obsolutely gorgeous and the movie does have some funny scenes. Great entertainment!
B000IZJZLM|5.0|these four gentlemen, are great, the music just put you into a calm place.  thank you
B0000029LG|4.0|HIStory is by all means a high quality album, but I deny it 5 stars because of a few stains.  Michael changes from a family-friendly artist to a bitter, cursing, angry figure.  The album has only one true love song, a great change from Michael's previous albums.  The album also must be purchased with previously recorded material, which drives the price higher.  The quality and sheer contagiousness of the tracks on HIStory makes it a notable album.  The tracks do provide more insight into Michael's thinking and deal with real issues rather than issue the typical love-ballad feel.  Even with it's minor drawbacks, HIStory is a must for the Michael Jackson fan.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I was extremely pleased with almost everything about this performance/DVD.  I thought the Monty Python segment was crude and out of place even though I am a fan of their movies.  McCartney sounded as good as ever, Ringo was fun and put on a good preformance.  Tom Petty was excellent.  Eric Clapton pulled everything together.  Probably my favorite performance was by Sam Brown (female) who has a hell of a voice with lots of power, and whe's pretty too.  I can't figure out why I've never heard of her, I think she prefers the other side of the Atlantic.  All in all, if you liked George Harrison and/or the Beatles, I can't see how you would be disappointed
B000VNMMRA|4.0|I thought this was one of the most enjoyable films of the summer of 2007. It had everything a blockbuster should have, including exploding helicopters, a chase scene involving a jet and an 18 wheeler, (on a non-existent part of 695), and lots of shooting. The only thing this movie lacked was a proper rating. All the previous Die Hard films were R-rated, and for good reason. Those movies were all about crazy action/violence, and loaded with profanity.  In order to attract a wider age range for this film, the producers decided to tone it down a little. Live Free or Die Hard was shot as an R-rated movie, but edited so that it could achieve PG-13. This was made obvious by the terrible visual and film editing throughout the movie. In several scenes there was action heard off screen or strange focus shifts between characters so that their curse words could be erased without seeing their mouths move. Thankfully, there are DVD releases so that the movie can be seen in all of its violent and swear filled glory. I am counting down the days until this comes out. I just hope beyond hope that i get to hear Bruce Willis say his trademark line in its fullest.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I just wanted to say that the only sure way of getting it is to own Season l and 2 and being able to rewatch it before Season 3 comes out in December.   There is so much in this series, so many tales and so many people to love and dislike, so many personalities with proof that no one person is perfect.   The only one of the so-called good characters that I think is a self-centered persons is Michael.   I love my children as much as anyone but I wouldn't kill my friends to save them.   I would trust them to help me.    I like the interaction of these people, one way or another which they wouldn't expect to normally happen, which shows that the world is much smaller than we think, even without modern technology.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie was so original at the time of it's release, but it has been copied so many time we forget this is where it all began. A gritty ingenious taunt thriller/horror/mystery film that is just the best of it's kind! Another golden performance by Freeman and Spacey is at his chilling best! It seems that every horror film I see now has ripped this film off in some way! Forget the phonies and check this one out again and if you haven't seen it......be prepared for an unforgetable journey! The 2 disc set has a great transfer and loads of extras!
B000EGCITG|5.0|One great song after another...I thought I'd just be listening to 2 or 3 of the tracks...but the whole cd is awesome!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I had great seats at the tour when it came back to America and the show is just as I remember it.  The musicianship is great as always, and the video does a good job of putting you in the theater with the group.  Almost every song from the Eagles you would expect is here along with solo hits and Joe Walsh is terrific.  A must buy!
0143034901|2.0|I started this book with high expectations because I had heard many good things about it.  I was warned to \\"stick with it\\" because it was fairly slow at the beginning.  Jeesh I thought it was unbearably slow for nearly 300 pages.  Something about it made me plod through it.  There was something compelling about it that made me finish it.  Having said that I would not recommend it.  It just was not worth the time invested in reading it.
B00005V9IK|4.0|What is with all the one stars?    This doesn't pretend to be a Sundance entry...it's just one heck of a good time.  Lighten up, appreciate it for what it is and is meant to be, and enjoy.
B000CNE092|4.0|I never saw this movie as a kid- since \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was being shown in theaters at the same time this was, I opted for that film.       However, finally watching this movie as a teenager I really wish I had seen it on th widescreen.       We have the tale of Anya- a \\"nobody\\" as she puts it, without a real name, past or family. Her only clue? A necklace with the words \\"Together In Paris\\" enscribed on it.     It's a beautifuly done movie, breathtaking animation- how can you NOT get shivers up and down your spine during the \\"Once Upon A December\\" scene? I know I can't. Rasputin in the cartoon looks rather like his historical counterpart, very, very creepy. I rather enjoyed how they made him \\"Undead\\" as in real life he was VERY hard to kill. (I don't remember HOW many times they attempted to kill Rasputin.)     Other than Rasputins looks, and several smaller details, the movie is largely historically unaccurate, but wonderful nontheless.     My one complaint? Sometimes Don's animation goes.... funny when he's trying to animate humans from a particular point of view. It could be just me, but I think he has that problem in ALL his animated films. (With the possible exception of \\"Titan AE\\")     Either way, add this to your collection. You won't be dissapointed.

B00005JPVN|5.0|This was one nasty, action-packed piece of celluloid. And I loved it. SHOOT 'EM UP feels like Owen, Giamatti, and Belluci, on a whim and during short breaks in between the shooting of a prestigious Ivory Merchant picture, decided to goof around with the cameras and somehow ended up with this bullet-riddled, somber-faced, but tongue-in-cheeked action film. Oh, the three of them play their roles intently and sincerely enough, but there doesn't seem to be a doubt that they had a hellacious hoot cobbling this actioner together. SHOOT 'EM UP is unapologetically, subversively violent and darkly humorous, furiously careening on screen like a Frank Miller graphic novel come to life.<br /><br />The meager plot: Carrot-chomping Mr. Smith (the cool and stoic Clive Owen) comes to the aid of a pregnant woman being pursued by a pack of assailants. In a tone-setting scene, the woman buys a bullet but not before Mr. Smith accesses his inner midwife and delivers the baby, along the way offing a villain with a vegetable. Now, Smith's maternal side surfaces as he's compelled to protect the newborn infant being mysteriously sought by a gang of gunmen, led by the vicious but p-whipped Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti, playing marvelously against type). Smith finds himself turning to one person: a beautiful, golden-hearted prostitute named DQ (Monica Belluci). And that's really all the plot one needs to know.<br /><br />In conceptualizing this film, probably the first thing to get tossed out the window was subtlety. What we're left with is a film with a title that's dead-on descriptive. The film foregoes things like plot nuances and character depth and development in favor of getting to the set pieces A.S.A.P. And, yet, the film does manage to maintain coherence and cohesion. The film opens up with a sequence that'll get your juices flowing, but, then, it sustains the high-octane pace. So, for those who like their flicks narratively fleshed out and fully explored, beware. There comes a time when a fella just gets sick and tired of back stories and elucidative exposition. SHOOT 'EM UP is a guy's flick, thru and thru, and will instantly envelop you in a warm, fuzzy blanket of wanton destruction and carrot abuse. This is a short film (around an hour and a half), but it comes at you in torrents of preposterous, frenetic, but stylish action sequences.<br /><br />And, absolutely, it more than makes up for the latest theater yawnfest that was Jet Li and Jason Statham's WAR. The male leads in SHOOT 'EM UP are two actors who, to go by their past works, are essentially bumming it here. But they do end up lending what credibility there is to lend to a film like this. Clive Owen plays it just right with his antihero character. Owen's Smith, with intense and deadpan panache and an understated one-liner or two, just keeps on wreaking damage of cartoonish proportions. By sheer will power and an overpoweringly composed demeanor, Owen makes you go along with the blistering sequences even as you shake your head at the gross unbelievability of it all. He does things with carrots which I'm quite certain God never intended for carrots to do. Paul Giamatti, whose Mr. Hertz seems to toil in a state of ever increasing aggravation, is again wonderful, this time in a part we're not used to seeing him play. It's a nice touch, by the way, the pestering wife and all. Henpecked and evil, that's Hertz all over. And, while Monica Belluci isn't really given much to work with in her been-there, done-that role, she looks beautiful, as ever.<br /><br />Lastly, keep an eye out for a funky sex scene which further underlines the gratuitous, cartoony feel of the film even as it succeeds in one-upping [[ASIN:B000K7UBSO Crank (Widescreen Edition)]]'s own boisterous display of lewdness.

0312995423|2.0|I will throw this book away as I simply couldn't allow anyone else to suffer through these stupid characters, literally stupid. I cannot believe the same man who wrote The Da Vinci Code has written this ridiculous novel. Susan, a 170 IQ cryptologist, can't think her way out of a paper bag. Her fiancé manages to avoid at least 6 assassination attempts as he repeatedly stumbles upon \\"just the person he was looking for.\\" Not a single character is believable. The climax of the book (will hackers get access to our nation's deepest secrets as the virus eats away at the 5 firewalls???)Is stunningly pathetic. One minute and counting, and Dan Brown has the characters literally reading out loud the text of a web page rather that spitting out the necessary facts. Give me a break. The book has a great setting and premise, but the execution of the plot is so poor, I wanted to scream. My suggestion to Mr. Brown is that he take a break from writing. You have to have a lot of money in the bank; you don't need to write to pay the bills. Don't blow another great idea.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|If you like Roy Orbison, you will love this CD.  He is such a pure talent and his music transcends through decades of time.  There is not a dud song in this entire CD.  Every song wraps you with melodic lyrics and the unbelievable silky smooth voice that was Roy's.  This is now one of my top CDs......also love to listen to it while I'm driving...

B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is not your typical romantic comedy. This movie encompasses the different aspects of love and relationships that we all have and treasure in our lives- the love we have for our romantic partners, for our children, for our friends, and even for people who have taken us completely by surprise when we realize how much they mean to us. It portrays several different relationships all interwoven into one cohesive story, and when you are done watching it you just feel.... warm and fuzzy. It's also wickedly funny. A great story that can be enjoyed by anyone... though I wouldn't show it to children because there is nudity. Still my favorite after all these years!
B000N3ST7K|5.0|This soundtrack is practically perfect.  One can listen to it over and over, without ever getting tired of the songs, specifically because the artists are so varied and heterogeneous.  Tarantino's finely tuned ear is responsible for this flawless collection of songs.  We'd been exposed to the musical style Tarantino favors in his previous films; that is, retro music, from the 50's, 60's, and 70's.  Deathproof was no exception, where Tarantino drew from Jack Nitzsche and T.Rex alike.  DDDBM&T's sixties song \\"Hold Tight\\" is delightfully addicting, while April March's much more recent memorable cover of \\"Chick Habit\\" is instantly identifiable with the film.  All in all, I'd have to recommend this as a perfect soundtrack to an absolutely fabulous film!
B00023B1LC|5.0|Although I am not that much in action movies, I really enjoyed this one, maybe because of Matt Damon who is such a good actor. Also this was the first one so the story hadn't been worn out yet. I just saw #2 and #3 and it really repeats. It reminds me of the TV program \\"The Fugitive\\". But all in all, I give it thumbs up.

B000002UA7|4.0|If you ever catch the video for \\"Experiment IV\\", you'll see a young Hugh Laurie (from \\"House\\") in the video.     This is a similar collection to The Cure \\"Standing On A Beach\\" collection, where it ends in the mid 80s. But their fans wound up with a followup collection.     In 1986, this collection covered the first 5. My opinion is that they're all worth getting, even \\"Lionheart\\", if you can find a copy of \\"This Womans Work\\" box set, you have to get it, unless there are plans to rerelease it to contain everything up to now. In 2007, a year after \\"Aerial\\" was released, we're now wondering when she's going to put out a 2 CD collection of songs from this as well as b-sides, remixes, live cuts (\\"James and the Cold Gun\\" esp) , duets with Midge Ure and Peter Gabriel (\\"Don't Give Up\\" and one she did with him for a TV special in the late 70s that's just as good), and \\"Sensual World\\" and \\"Red Shoes\\".     Comparisons to Tori are ridiculous. The \\"Little Earthquakes\\" cover was seen as a big time KB rip off of the \\"Kick Inside\\" album cover (there's 2 versions of that cover), and there are some influences, but Tori's built her own sound and style.    I think that you could hear a lot of Joni Mitchell's influence with the voice and Del Palmer's bass playing does remind me of the stuff she did around the mid to late 70s with Jaco... but considering Kate was only 18 when she put her first album out, it's pretty mindblowing the stuff she was writing. When she turned 21 she was pretty much self-producing her albums. The musicians on her albums have always been the best, and she seemed to try to go for all sorts of sounds.     But when I hear this, stuff like Wedding List, Moving, Violins, Infant Kiss, Don't Give Up, This Womans Work, Moments of Pleasure, Them Heavy People, James and the Cold Gun, Pull Out the Pin, and I could keep going... but there's a lot that she's done that would fare better on a 2 CD collection that would cover a lot of favorites in 2 1/2 hours.     This does capture the different styles, so no complaints there.

B000002LSV|5.0|All I Can say is do yourself a favour, and if you love one ZZ TOP tune then you will love this entire set.This band is one of the few world bands that work to a formula, for want of a better word, but basically deliver what the fans want. If you  \\"Get it\\" then you will go out and get. ZZ TOP deliver in the same way ACDC delivers, SABBATH, DIO, whatever band you name, these guys work their side of the tracks and they know you will love em. Even the Album I think called XXX or triple X is different, still the same \\"The best Lil ol Band From Texas...\\"... what more can I add. I agree that a Multi disc set is what these guys deserve, but this will come eventually. Anything this iconic... I mean who else  has that ZZ logo that makes the best damn Key Chain in the world for the best and Coolest Car in the World, as well as the Coolest music... Every Girl Crazy bout a ZZ Top Man !!!

B000LPS3B2|5.0|Ringu, the Japanese horror film started it all. Soon the Koreans followed with their films and now here is a contribution from Thailand. And like many of its predecessors \\"Shutter\\" is currently being remade in English.     The first thing that is really striking is the neat production. This is my first Thai film and I was surprised at the total package. The screenplay is good and though there is some blood it cannot be classified under \\"slasher\\" horror. Creepy scenes there are a plenty and the film is really good at it. The movie will grab your attention right from the beginning and have you hooked till the end. The story of revenge is nothing new but with a nice twist.     Two beautiful things that the movie excels at are its lovely theme tune and the beautiful little romance that goes awry. And here's a tip. At the close of the film pay special attention. I knew there was something queer but didn't care to check it out. If not for a friend's advice I would have never taken a second look. You must if you didn't notice anything unusual. Go for the original with English subtitles.
0143038419|5.0|I must admit, it took me a while to get into this book.  I purchased it when it first came out in hard cover. At the time, I just couldn't get into it.  The book sat on my nightstand for nearly a year.  Recently, I opened the book again and gave it another shot.  I've heard so many great things about the book, I was sure that there was something I was missing!  All I can say is that I wish I would have read it sooner.  Gilbert's writing is like reading a letter from a friend.  I found her search for balance easy to relate to.  She has inspired me to search for my own balance in life.  If you need a book to help get you out of a rut, you'll find this book inspiring.  At least I know I did!

I highly recommend it to others.  My family and friends played it this summer and loved it.  We found it hard to stop playing, as we always got new ideas for the next game that we thought would help us win!

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Keira Knightley butchered what could have been a refreshing adaption to a beautiful story. Knightley appears oblivious to whom her character is. Again her constant posing and trying to be sexy by hanging her mouth open, is distracting and obnoxious.  And, once again, it falls to the other actors to carry her and fill in the gaps in her performance.  I dont' know what her agent had to pull to get her this role, but it's a waste of time, talent, and money. Only a miracle worker like Johnny Depp can cover for her like he did in \\"Pirates\\".

This one is a little eery, like the movie, I suppose.  Number one was more fun.<br />As an aspiring sailor, my favorite line from all 3 movies, \\"...what a ship is, what the Black Pearl really is, is freedom.\\"  AAARRGH!
0316067598|5.0|One book that truly everyone should read! Reveals a clearer understanding into the life, the training, the Heart of our American Military Special Operation Teams. So well written with Mr.Luttrell's honesty and spirit, I could not put the book down. (Very insighful in regards to the Middle Eastern culture)  God Bless our Troops!
B000002AT6|5.0|What can I say.  I love the movie and now I can take the soundtrack with me in the car.  I sweeps me away everytime I hear it.  Zimmer is a genius.
B0000047CX|5.0|I listened to this music back when it was first played and it was great. I purchased this CD as a gift for someone who is a fan of \\"Girl From Ipanema.\\" However, I liked it so much I kept the CD.<br /><br />It was first nostalgic but after listening to all of the CD it is classic Brazilian Music interpreted by one of the best American Saxophonist of his time and a wonderful voice. It is great having both renditions Portuguese and the 45rpm.  GREAT ALBUM!!!
B000PFUAO6|4.0|There's no reason to read reviews of this or any other Dream Theater album.  Everybody who's interested KNOWS these guys are technically proficient.  Beyond that, different songs from different albums appeal to different people, and we'll never agree on the best period, the best albums or the best songs of Dream Theater.  Just be happy these guys continue to make new music.    So if you are inclined to like Dream Theater music, then it is worth your while to spend a few hours (or days) listening to every single one of their albums and finding for yourself what moves you and what works for you.  There is no point in reading ANY reviews.  Just find the songs you like, the mood you like, the style you like, whatever.  There's something for everyone in this band.  Simply listen to every album a few times and find what you like and leave it at that.  No need to debate whether one album sounds like another, whether they've lived up to past tendencies, whether they've changed musical styles.  Forget about it.  If you like this type of music, you will find something to like on EVERY SINGLE ALBUM.  So listen to them all, and start your own collection of favorite Dream Theater songs.  That's what I've done.  And I await every new album knowing that I'll be adding to that collection.
B000SM7QUC|2.0|The album has potential musically, but man, the lyrics awful and I can't get past them.  It's fine when music has an explicit story and message, but it could be conveyed in a much more interesting way.  The lyrics here are like the daily news, but good music is more poetic.  The Amazon review seems harsh, but dead-on.
B00062IVKI|5.0|In Martin Scorsese's much-maligned NEW YORK, NEW YORK, the hollow artifice of the 1940s Technicolor musical clashes with the brutal honesty of human emotion, in a story about a doomed relationship between two individuals whose mutual love for music draws them together and pulls them apart.<br /><br />In post-war New York, brash saxophonist Jimmy Doyle (Robert De Niro) meets young singer Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli), and together they join forces to create a new jazz and big-band sound.  In typical \\"Star is Born\\" fashion, Francine is signed to a major record label and later becomes a Hollywood movie star; Jimmy's callous attitude to her wanting to start a family becomes the key for their break-up.  The tempestuous love affair of Francine and Jimmy is the backbone of NEW YORK, NEW YORK, almost two different movies rolled into one: affectionate tribute to the classic Hollywood musical, and dramatic backstage romance.  That duality is the reason why NEW YORK, NEW YORK stands up well to repeat screenings; Scorsese's masterful touch is all over this masterpiece, which is only now beginning to be recognized as a classic of it's time.<br /><br />While the story may seem to be channeling \\"A Star is Born\\" (which starrred Minnelli's mother Judy Garland as an unknown who outgrows her husband's moviestar success); the characters of Francine and Jimmy, and their violent relationship, share a closer kinship to the Doris Day/James Cagney musical drama \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\"; Day's abusive 1941 marriage to jazz musician Al Jordan was also paralleled.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is a rare treat; Laszlo Kovacs' cinematography and the art direction of Boris Leven is flawless.  In one memorable scene, Jimmy and Francine wander into a yellowed barren wood that looks like something from the opening titles of \\"Doctor Zhivago\\".  Veteran M-G-M hair stylist Sydney Guilaroff took care of Ms Minnelli's many elaborate, period-perfect hair creations (and in another lovely twist, Minnelli got to use her mother Judy Garland's original M-G-M dressing room while making this movie).<br /><br />NEW YORK, NEW YORK used many original songs of the period for it's soundtrack (\\"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\\", \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\", \\"The Man I Love\\", \\"Just You, Just Me\\").  Especially-written for the movie by her longtime collaborators John Kander and Freb Ebb were several new songs which became staples of Liza Minnelli's repertoire (\\"But the World Goes 'Round\\", \\"Happy Endings\\", and \\"New York, New York\\").  The extensive production number for \\"Happy Endings\\" was modeled after the \\"Born in a Trunk\\" sequence from Judy Garland's \\"A Star is Born\\".<br /><br />Robert De Niro's saxophone solos were dubbed by Georgie Auld (De Niro does a very convincing job of handling the instrument).  The supporting cast includes Mary Kay Place, Larry Kert, Lionel Stander and Barry Primus.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  NEW YORK, NEW YORK, initially dismissed by audiences and critics upon it's release in 1977, is now slowly being discovered as a masterpiece for the ages, and I for one am thrilled.arland's original M-G-M dressing room while making this movie).

B0000041XX|5.0|I'm not a big fan of opera,I'm mostly a rock and jazz fan,but I ended up really enjoying this great CD by the Three Tenors(Carreras,Domingo,and Pavarotti)!!! \\"The Three Tenors in Concert/Mehta\\" is quite a treat!!! R.I.P. Luciano Pavarotti. Recommended!!! Five stars!!! A+
0316067598|5.0|Good reading from a young man who is doing what he set out to do from a young age. Given his vocation, he has a balanced world view, loves his Country and displays an enviable loyalty. I liked the bits of down to earth advice and am passing the book along to a WW2 Marine.   From the book, \\"A hook nosed Taliban warrior was peering straight at me... the barrel of his AK47 pointed right at my head. Had he seen me? Would he open fire? How did the Liberals feel about my position?\\"
B000KRNCYY|5.0|You would love this cd.  Of course you must appreciate this style of music to enjoy it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I am a huge fan of the History and Discovery Channels and the amazing shows they regularly broadcast. However, BBC's Planet Earth by far takes the cake for wonderful cinematography.  It's amazing how much beauty is still being discovered on our small planet.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves animals, landscapes and eye-opening documentaries.
1594489505|5.0|After reading thousands of books, this tops the list of all time favorite reads.  It is worth every penny and more.  This is the only book that I have ever read twice.  I totally and completely loved it!!!!!  You will too.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|A cd that has the word LOVE written all over it, I have played this in my car about probably more than 5 times non stop and I love it everytime I hear it, never sick of it. Definatly worth the bucks. He is a genious.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|A great action film - could have had a little more love interest involved to balance it out.  But, a must see for anyone who loves sword fighting/action movies.  I liked the scene in particular where they battle the man giant.  Great stuff.
B000002GVO|4.0|I can only rate on the appearance at this time.  I bought it for a Christmas present.  Appearance wise, it looks very good.  pat
0316926345|5.0|Evelyn Waugh himself said that he there were only six people in America who would understand Brideshead Revisited and looking at these customer reviews I find myself forced to agree.
B000Q79HS8|4.0|But over all a great movie. I love the Fights But in this movie the camera shakes so much that its hard to see them.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|First off, the beauty of this film to me was that one could have a both fairly cerebral and emotional reaction to this movie rather easily. I mean that in the best of ways. \\"The lives of others\\" starts out with the decision of the state to monitor a playwrite, for reason's that are not exactly the purest. But soon stasi (secret police) member Gerd takes sympathy with those he is forced to watch, and according to some, seems to fall in love with their lives. The plot thickens as a article written by a secret east german writer appears in the west, who the goverment believe to the character of Georg who is already under watch. Thought the rest of the movie, Gerd takes action to make sure that Georg is protected from the over zealous hammer of authority. One can only wish we met such people more often. Without giving away the rest of the plot, a great deal of drama, wonderful acting, and a amazing background setting(I must find out where this is filmed!). One of the wonderful things I took away from this movie, was seeing the person make the choice of using his ethics and heart, rather than excusing himself with the old failed defense of \\"taking orders\\". Any serious fan of film would be doing themselves a great diservice to miss one of the best films i've seen in quite a long time.<br />Hopefully, things will get together and the DVD will be realised here in the next month. I think this film is worthy of a criterion release as well, hopefully they notice it, although I imagine with a spiffy DVD or not, i'll be buying this movie soon after it is released.
6305754969|5.0|I love John Wayne westerns. My husband loves his war movies. El Dorado is one of my all-time favorite westerns and right behind \\"The Quiet Man\\" for my favorite John Wayne movie.<br /><br />My kids loved the theme song. The younger one used to sing \\"Ride Goldie Ride\\" (instead of Ride Boldly Ride) for days after watching this. I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD as the VHS version was well worn.<br /><br />Sure, it's a remake of Rio Bravo. I love Rio Bravo but think El Dorado is better. Even though I like Dean Martin in Rio Bravo a lot, Robert Michum  portrays a drunken sheriff so much betterand is funnier. \\"I've got a bed in the jail. It's hard and narrow, but he won't get bounced around.\\" Ed Asner is a better bad guy. Claude Akins' character in Rio Bravo is a dumb thug; Asner's intelligence shows into his character in El Dorado. Yeah, no singing in El Dorado and I did like that in Rio Bravo. My husband says Rio Bravo is better just because of the very young, scantily clad Angie Dickinson.<br /><br />John Wayne portrays an honorable gun fighter. He's still tough as nails, fighting on the right side, loyal to his friends, and gets the girl. That part would be a little hard to believe nowadays, or would it? The girl is way young for him and Mitchum, but she is obviously, though it wasn't stated, a cathouse madam, and therefore, a man with money is attractive, regardless of age. John Wayne was one big tall fella, and every time I see this movie, I look for him on his horse, Cochise. Wayne practically dwarfs his horse. Caan and Mitchum were both tall men, but the Duke just towers over everyone.<br /><br />James Caan is young, handsome, and amusing. His character Mississippi, is just the right complement to Wayne's and Mitchum's near-crusty, experienced gunslinging characters. I loved his home remedy for sobering up Mitchum. The bath scene, with many bars of soap is funny, too.<br /><br />No bad language, no sex (you don't even see lips touch during the kissing scenes), no one bleeds when they get shot, and the good guys win at the end.t, and the good guys win at the end.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|At the end of this movie, you'll look up and your first thought will be \\"Thank God, it's all still here.\\" I was a teenager in the 80's when I saw this on TV and it has always stayed with me.    I love just about anything from the 1980's now and regularly pull out movies from that era- but this is one I just can't see again. However, I'd recommend it to everyone anyhow, to see once. It personalizes the results of nuclear conflict in a way no other movie did before or since.    Funny thing is, the world today feels like it was safer back then, when we were fairly sure that nuclear weapons were only in the hands of (relatively) rational human beings instead of lunatic terrorists.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC.... in every sense of the word. I have never seen such an easy transformation from actor to reality.... Glen and Marketa take VERY little effort to make you believe them. Their performances were utterly heart-breaking. Compelling, stunning... gorgeous. That's all there is to it. I RAN to the music store to buy the vinyl and the cd format, I was so ... amazed by the music. Just do it....
0783226063|3.0|Long, weird, and totally overwrought--Dune is mainly worth checking out for the fantastic art direction, cinematography, and bizarre sci-fi vision of David Lynch.
6303234844|5.0|This show still has an almost spiritual meaning/feeling for me. I'm not sure why. All I know is that it moves me. I too laugh, cry, smile and move.    I forgot about it for a while and lost the tape. And now, as I get ready to order it from Amazon, I'm listening to \\"In Your Eyes,\\" and I find my self moving and moved ... again.    This combination of talent may just never be matched again.    .
B000063UR2|3.0|Some films are better left in the recesses of your nostalgic memories.  Legend is one of them.  Great art direction, costumes, cinematography and direction can't save a story with no action and unappealing characters.  Re-watching this after not having seen it for about a decade, all I kept thinking was, \\"What a waste!\\"  The sets, the special effects, everything is very nice for the time but totally squandered on a very loose story with little thought put into creating an authentic or detailed fantasy world.  I think Ridley Scott wanted to make a Lord of the Rings-type epic but didn't bother to investigate why or how successful fantasy stories work.
0064431789|4.0|I like reading this story to my little girl. She loves the unique pictures and the story line makes her giggle. It is something different than the normal fairy tale stories, which I happen to be sick of. I think it is a fun book for both me and my little girl to read.
B000I5X80G|3.0|I loved the live versions of Down by the River and Cowgirl in the Sand but could have skipped the rest of the album by a long shot.
B000QFCD5O|5.0|Wow, this is probably the best live recording I can recall. Treats on this disk for me were \\"Fanfare For The Common Man\\" a great re-worked version, bass solo, and Steve Howe electric guitar input to an originaly trio arranged composition. The other was \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\", again, something from the past played with a renewed sound, the musicianship is outstanding from all players.  The two re-worked acoustic versions are also worth the purchase, \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\", and \\"Ride Easy\\" gives feel and new flavor to the performances of both.  I'm awaiting the DVD in October to see how the songs were performed, and with Wetton's recent illness, is the only Asia we'll see for a little while.  The mix, backbeat and all peformers are done very well for a live recording, 5 stars + from me...  A great CD for any musician, music, or Asia fan.
B000GYHVFC|2.0|The movie is visually stunning, make no mistake.  And there are lots of nice effects.  The background story is solid; it is the execution that is flawed.    Quite often, the plot feels like information was left out.  It never does a good job of transitioning from one moment to the other.  In fact, at times it is outright confusing.    The flow of the story uses recycled elements.  There is the bad guy who really isn't the bad guy, the \\"I am your father\\" type twist (in this case \\"I am your wife\\"), the hero (or heroine) is hunted by the good guys and the bad guys twist, and the real bad guy is trying to gain power twist.  It feels like the director and writers saw several movies and said \\"Hey! Lets put that idea in our movie.\\"    The base story was solid, but it was ruined by bad writing and bad directing.  I just wish a competent director would take this concept and run with it.
B000T05R90|5.0|First lemme say that if you had bought the original US release of PIPER back in the day on the TOWER label, you bought a bastardized version of the album. TOWER dropped ASTRONOMY DOMINE from the original tracking as SEE EMILY PLAY was a hit single in England at the time of its US release. Gotta have them singles on those albums if you wanna sell here in the good ol USA!    The current track listing IS the ORIGINAL EMI track listing as released in England back in 1967.    This kinda reminds me of when EMI/CAPITOL decided to release all the BEATLE albums with the original European track listings.    ...also, you really didn't need to wait for this release to get EMILY on disc. The song also appears on a limited edition release called \\"EARLY SINGLES\\". It was also released in the SHINE ON Boxset on a bouns disc as well as appearing on the release of \\"RELICS\\", which came out a few years back.
B000008B01|5.0|Perfect summer music.  The opposite of annoying jazz.  Beautiful guitar chords, nice rhythm, minimalist accompaniment, low-key voice.  I don't speak Portuguese, but I love it.  It's zen jazz.
B000ROALCG|2.0|Instead of buying this, you could buy \\"El Cantante: The Originals\\", a compilation album that has many of the same songs as this, except that it's really Hector Lavoe that's singing them.  Seriously, if you had the choice between listening to Hector Lavoe and listening to Marc Anthony doing a bad imitation of Hector Lavoe, why would you buy this one?    Anyway, in this album, Marc Anthony does a very bad imitation of Hector Lavoe.  If you like Marc Anthony and you have to have all his albums, then sure, you're going to want this one.  But hopefully after getting the \\"Originals\\" compilation (if not a few of Hector Lavoe's albums--and dont' forget to get Willie Colon's, while you're at it!)
6305388458|5.0|Absolutly my most favorite of the Python films. A completely hysterical movie! One of the best parts is Eric Idle singing \\"Always look on the bright side of life\\" at the end.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|A great tv series worth watching. I was hooked from the first moment. It's scary, suspenseful and funny. I highly recommend this item to anyone who enjoys this type of television genre and they wont be disappointed.    I cant wait until season 2 comes out on DVD and for the 3rd season to begin.
B000FA57RQ|2.0|A better title for Madonna's latest video-nonsense might be, \\"Confessions of a Cabala Infomercial.\\" Madonna had tremendous difficulty getting her mucumentary distributed (probably because no one is interested in watching a nearly 50 y/o grown-woman parading around like a teenager, preaching the Cabala.) ...So what does the queen of commercialism do? She convinces MTV to air it (commercial-free, of course) then releases this the following summer on DVD and separately with a CD of throw-away tracks so she can get the most bang for her buck. In 1990 Madonna made a film that was a huge phenomenon (like herself at the time), called \\"Truth Or Dare\\" that is a modern-day classic. In 2004, she gave little effort, and even less talent to produce another video tour memoir called, \\"I'm Going To Tell You a Secret.\\" Madonna sounds, and appears very sterile in the entire picture. She enjoys telling people about \\"the new Madonna\\" and how their lives will be better if they conform to her beliefs. Like another huge legend once said, Joan Crawford, \\"you take care of your evil, and I'll take care of mine...\\" These are words to live by as far as I'm concerned. The film doesn't give any insight into \\"who Madonna really is.\\" Perhaps, Madonna's 2003 hit (from the commercial bomb \\"American Llife\\") \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" really does describe the 80's white-blonde airhead. Moreover, there once was a time when Madonna could at least play herself; now she can't even do that because she is so shallow and paper-thin. As a singer, dancer and entertainer I love Madonna, but as a movie producer she just doesn't interest me.
0743454537|2.0|While story was engrossing, the characters were stereotypes.  A lot of the plot was therefore not terribly believable.  I actually felt so outraged by the ending, I am writing my first review on Amazon.com.  I will never read another book by this author.
B000M3452Y|5.0|What a unique album. After hearing LCD's single \\"North American Scum\\" I knew that I had to go out and get \\"Sound of Silver\\" and I'm not disappointed. Sound of Silver is not strictly a \\"Electronic\\" album. Songs like \\"North American Scum\\" and \\"All my Friends\\" don't have any electronic elements to them at all and are great indierockesque tracks. With Sound of Silver, LCD shows that they can go between different styles of music effortlessly and still make a great and coherent album. One of the most enjoyable things about LCD is their sense of humor, like in \\"North American Scum\\" \\"and people who still think we're from England we're like...no...\\" that line aways cracks me up. The track that highlighted the album for me was \\"Someone Great\\" a truly beautiful track that shows LCD at the height of their talents. I highly recommend this album to fans of Daft Punk or just good music. Great album.
0307237699|5.0|You would expect that a \\"political\\" book released by a politician in the run-up to a presidential election would be somewhat boring.  However, by using the compelling personal stories of regular Americans to make his points, Obama's book was actually quite entertaining.    Like his now-famous speech at the 2004 DNC, Obama makes the point that it is possible to practice a different type of politics.   Our nation has seemingly lost the capacity, due to partisanship (from both sides), to solve the really big problems.  Obama's book demonstrates that he has the capacity to truly listen to the other side, and to find the common ground necessary to solve the key issues facing our nation.   Obama's book is even hard on some Dems, writing that they are sometimes the \\"party of reaction\\".    The book lays out his policy positions on education, Iraq, health care, and the plight of people struggling in America's inner cities.  The fact that Obama also spent 3 years as a community organizer in the poor area on the Southside of Chicago seems to have had a huge impact on his view of grass-roots activism.   This perspective could be an asset for his presidential bid.

038572179X|5.0|Everything good about this book has already been said by others. The writing is elegant and poetic. The characters are real and memorable, Best of all, they evolve! Isn't that why we read, to experience character development? I have read this book twice and it has stayed with me as few other books have. It was also a big hit with my all guys book club.
0316067598|5.0|Marcus Luttrell's story is inspiring and thought-provoking. His candid, genuine tale of personal growth through an event that could have embittered him and turned him forever vengeful is profoundly moving. Marcus puts a face to the men in combat, and to the people of Afghanistan. In his humanity, his loyalty, his committment, and his devotion to his friends, family, and country he reflects the essence of what it means to be a true servant of God. I have great respect for him, and wish him a long life and peace of mind.
0099771810|1.0|This book was quite impossible for me to finish. I found the writing unbelievably self-indulgent, muddy and abstruse. In a vain effort to be poetic, Philip Roth's style becomes overblown and ego-centric. Many times he expresses a thought in 3 or 4 pages that could have been articulated in a couple of paragraphs. It's like scratching an itch on your right ear with your left hand. I grew up in a neighborhood similar to his setting so I appreciated this but there wasn't enough clarity or dramatic reality to make me continue reading. His characters are cardboard and uninteresting. They didn't mak me care about them.
B000MZHW40|4.0|My job takes me to Africa, and I travel there for pleasure as well, so my B.S.-radar was \\"on\\" throughout the film, watching for Western cliches and the liberal drivel that tainted the book.  But the movie delivered as both entertainment and is a more reasoned presentation of the problems caused by the African diamond trade.       DiCaprio, Connelly, and Hounsou were all excellent in their roles, but it is definitely DiCaprio as the Rhodesian exile that makes this film compelling.  Also, the outrageous chase scenes that many movie-goers are so tired of are well done and more palatable in an African setting where gunfights are a believable occurance.  Being stopped at a checkpoint by ten year-olds armed with AK-47s is not Hollywood fantasy.      There remains an underlying message condemning the world's diamond trade.  It's a political statement that has some merit, but is overblown (as it was in the book) in identifying its true culprits.  DiCaprio's character delivers some lines that give more than lip-service to other reasons for the bloodshed; his dialogue with an American reporter knocks the book's overly-simplistic views back on its heels.
B000N6U0DS|4.0|this film was a reflection of a man's dilemmas in real life. will smith, the wonderful actor that he is, really captured this mans tragedy, his suffering, his will to fight, to achieve what others thought impossible. he gave you that feeling that almost anything can be done. will smith is brilliant, the man is an A+. he put such feeling and emotions into the film that you really felt for him. and his son jaden might just take after his father. nice job. overall this movie was nicely done. there was a lesson to be learned, a life to portray, and so many things to deal with. basically how the average person is living. paycheck to paycheck all the same worries, the rent, the bills, and having to struggle. he was the man and he had to do something. he had to fix the problem, and although it took risk, fight, and everything he had, along side his son he made it happen. it wasn't easy, but nothing ever is that's worth fighting for. great movie, no doubt.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|I was first turned on to Muse by watching High Tension. Good movie by the way. It's a horror movie.  It played portions of the song New Born during the movie and during the credits.  I liked the song so much, I wanted to know who these guys were. There is no soundtrack for the movie, so I bought their album.  I love it. I hate buying whole albums cause I end up only liking that one song. But I thought I would take a chance on this one and I'm glad I did.   New Born, Micro Cuts, Space Dementia, Bliss, Screenager, Hyper Music, Darkshines and Megalomania, Feeling Good are hot.  Don't get me wrong all the songs are good. Those are just the ones I can listen to over and over again. Another reason why I like them so much is the different variations in each song. It's not just one single solid beat throughout the whole song. The beat, melodies, tones, moods, all change within each song which makes it so much more intresting, and likable. Get this album, use your best stereo system, or you best headphones, earphones and crank it up. If your head don't bob to this, then something's wrong. I'm just sayin.  Get this album. Seriously.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|i really liked this movie, it was pretty good. the whole ship going upside down, having to find a way out before the ship sinks, and only a handful survive. i enjoyed it from beginning to end. the jumping, the climbing, and the swimming they did throughout the whole ship to get to their destination was nicely done. i do recommend because it has that good combination of action and suspense to draw you in. josh lucas was is a very good actor and here he just proved it again. something charming about this guy, and they way he just falls into the leadership role, and becomes the hero. kurt russell, the doting father, has to get through it with his daughter. he hasn't lost his touch. the small appearance of fergie was widely viewed as well. it wasn't another big ship sinks movie, but a story of survival, in one of the worst case scenarios. i do recommend.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This cd is worth owening. It is a work of art let me tell you. I strongly recommend it, you wont be dissapointed.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|The movie was a gift for my husband and step-son who both play the guitar.  My Husband has seen it many times but it was the first time my step-son saw it.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has a musician in the family or someone who just loves music.
0743289684|3.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a fascinating and interesting person.  This book goes into a lot of detail about her personnal life.  Some of it is interesting and provides new information on Islam.  However, the majority of this book is too in depth in regards to the details of her life than soemone with a passing interest would want to know.  For example, in the first chapter she goes back through her family tree.  For the first couple of chapters the details are important but after that it becomes a struggle to read.  The last 70 pages - her life in Holland's government, her views on Islam, and the scrutiny over the movie she made - are what I purchased the book and expected to be reading about.  This part was great and if you see this book in a library it is worth the 30 minutes to gloss over what she has to say.  I understand she needed to provide a background on how she came to those views but she took to long to do so.  Also if her views on issues are not reflective of other Islams - which from what else I have read they are not - it distorts her arguments.  Taking her views on Islam as the correct way to view Islam is like taking everything Michael Moore says in his \\"documentary\\" on the US healthcare system as fact as well.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I won't get into the plot or the characters, since so many other people already have.  I just want to say that I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for something \\"real\\" to lose yourself in for a couple hours.  I just got done watching it for the first time and my attention never strayed.  It will be one of the very few movies that make it into my collection.      I know others thought the ending was too long.  Personally, I was happy to see an ending that actually wrapped up the film sufficiently.  I thought it was an appropriate length for the film, and a very good way to end things.       Overall, this movie is very suspenseful and meaningful.  Definitely worth the time spent watching it!
B0002MG9SI|5.0|On the front it had a gold sticker that said \\"recommended movie\\".  I rented Amelie under the suggestion of a friend and was a little skeptic of the front photo that was of a very pale girl.    1 Amelie is not that pale  2 The narration and the acting were just great fun  3 I just really loved the plot and ending    Amelie is not meant to be a gushy drama but romantic in its own way.  It's not meant to be a conventional comedy, but is very funny anyway. It's very light and lifts your heart up with it. The direction, acting and narration are smooth, satisfying and skillfully done.    So, after watching it twice the same day I bought it the next.  Here is five stars to Amelie.
B00005V1B2|5.0|This is one of those albums that kind of sneaks up on you.  After the first listen you'll like it.  After the second or third listen you'll start to think it's great.  Somewhere about the tenth time you've listened to it in a week you'll realize you love it.  A more or less instrumental album it comes from the mellower end of the progressive rock spectrum, but it's never so mellow as to be pop or just down right insipid.  It's a wonderfully melodic and orchestral album for a quartet with a great blend of guitars, analog keys, piano, flute, bass and drums.  This was my introduction to Camel and from the others I've heard I can definitely say this is my favorite.  It probably still gets at least one spin a week.

0440238609|4.0|While I feel this story could have been told in one or two books, they all moved quickly and I was constantly interested.  I greatly suggest this series!
B000QXDED6|3.0|Wow...what a let down. It was good but not awesome like I was expecting it to be. The action scenes were very nice but other than that there was just nothing. I didn't feel connected to any of the characters because we never really get to know a single one of them. When they weren't fighting it was boring. But every frame of the movie is just beautiful. And it really made me wanna get a cape. Everybody looks cool in a cape! You'd think in battle it'd get stepped on by the guy behind you but no... it's just cool looking
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Once Halloween was Samhain, the one night of the year when the dead returned to cause trouble for the living.<br /><br />Well, Michael Myers wasn't dead, but on \\"Halloween\\" he returned to cause trouble for the people of his hometown, with all its dark houses and teenage victims. And John Carpenter's masterpiece lives up to its reputation: creepy, eerie, harrowing, and full of solid acting from Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis.<br /><br />On Halloween, 1963, young Michael Myers lurked outside the house while his sister had sex with her boyfriend. After he left, Michael put on a mask, picked up a knife, and stabbed his sister to death.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is about to take Myers to a legal hearing, when Myers (Nick Castle) breaks open the psych hospital and escapes in Loomis' car. On Halloween, teenage Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) notices a silent, masked figure popping up and disappearing near her school, house, and neighborhood.<br /><br />Despite this, she goes about her babysitting duties, even taking care of another girl's charge overnight. The only problem is, the girl is dead, and so is another pal and her boyfriend. Dr. Loomis is staking out Myers' old home, unaware that Myers is now prowling the house where Laurie is staying -- and there seems to be no way to avoid the knife-wielding \\"evil.\\"<br /><br />It sounds like a thousand knockoff movies made since then, but \\"Halloween\\" formed the original mold. And like any other groundbreaker, it is the most stripped-down, intense example of the genre -- little gore, little graphic violence, but the way it's handled is enough to make your hair stand on end, and make you go to bed with a gun under your pillow.<br /><br />And Carpenter handles the spookiness beautifully -- initially, the story is pleasantly average -- teen gossip, small-town atmosphere, and chatter about boyfriends, dances and babysitting. It has the occasional spooky moment -- such as Myers popping out of a hedge to stare at Laurie -- but isn't really scary just yet. But as Myers starts bumping off teenagers, the plot darkens and twists.<br /><br />Carpenter spins up a claustrophobic, trapped feeling, partly due to a shadowy old house full of windows and doors, any of which could be Myers' way in. You can't help but jump with every shadow. And Carpenter sprinkles the plot with unspeakably creepy moments -- Myers quietly slithering in a window above Laurie, or dressing as a ghost with only his heavy breathing to identify him.<br /><br />Curtis was the original scream queen thanks to this movie, and she does an amazing job -- even when she's racing around pounding on doors and shrieking, she seems realistic. Pleasance is just as good as Loomis, who is determined and full of dread at what his patient is, but also has his moments of humour (like when he frightens some pranksters at the Myers house). And though we only see Myers' face a few times, his masked face, silent movements and heavy breathing are the stuff of nightmare.<br /><br />\\"Halloween\\" was a more psychological, atmospheric kind of horror, and it did its job almost too well.

B00005JPMZ|5.0|LOVED IT!!! From the previews I thought it was gonna suck because it was animated instead of live action like the previous movies were but this movie totally rocked! I thought the animation was fast, colorful, and it made the turtles look really cool! I still love Mikey! He's been my favorite since I was like 7 years old. This movie was a little dark, which I loved, and the fight between Leo and Raf was the best part! I hope there's a sequel!!!
074325144X|4.0|I have now read both Danny Dreyer's Chi Running and Nicholas Romanov's POSE Method of Running several times and if you're thinking of picking one or the other I'd say you can learn a lot by reading both    POSE is a little more mechanical, in its approach... chi a little more, well, Zen but the core messages are very similar and there are enough differences in approach to make them both worthwhile
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I will not share my impressions of this brilliant film, because so many other reviews have pointed out its excellence in regard to plot, cinematography, acting etc. and I agree completely. But I do want to urge everyone who watches it to watch it straight through and then go into the special features and set it up so you can watch it again with the director's commentary. This dvd is loaded with extras (including deleted scenes, none of which are outstanding or necessary) but I was most impressed with the honest heartfelt commentary by the writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck that I highly recommend everyone buy the film - even if you watched it on the big screen - just for this very reason. The Lives of Others is indeed one of the best films of the decade.
6305882592|5.0|I've loved this movie ever since I was first introduced to it in college 15 years ago.  It's filled with very funny scenes, terrific acting, and the most PERFECT movie soundtrack.  Buy it!  Watch it until you have every line and musical note memorized!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Another job well done!  I loved this movie but the movie cover stinks.  Where in the movie does anything on the front cover happen?  I'm glad that the movie came out and it was an awesome movie.  It really tied up loose ends!  Thank you Joss Whedon!    As for the people mad about the preacher dying and Wash dying, they wanted to be written out of the script in case they brought the show back.  It wasn't Joss' call.
0385486804|5.0|One of my favorite of favorites. It should be a five star in every rating.  I have read it alteast 20 times and in my youth opened my eyes to the literary masters, such as Tolstoy and Thureau, both of which are quoted extensivly from the man himself.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox was so unfair to Firefly.  They didn't air the episode in order, they played the third episode first...How dumb is that?  People were very confused and they did a horrible job of advertising it.  Fox really screwed the pooch on this one.  It was an awesome show.  I'm just sad that it got canned before they showed several of the episodes.  I am glad that Joss got to make the movie \\"Serenity\\" which is a continuation of the TV show but I would have like the show brought back!  This is an awesome show!
B000P0J024|5.0|I think I saw one of the videos on YouTube -- maybe \\"Handle With Care\\" -- and I was sold.  I already had Vol I and Vol 3 -- bought years ago.  For some reason, I thought I had tired of the Wilburys some years ago, but somehow these tracks seem better.  Maybe I'm just getting older and more sentimental.  Seeing the documentary certainly enhances the enjoyment of hearing these songs even without the video -- truly priceless.  Not often do we get a chance to see Orbison laughing and singing.  And Dylan!  Wow, such a gentleman to do this, with all the commitments he has to fulfill -- if you want to enjoy these superstars on video, enjoying each other's company, this is a must buy.  It amazes me how good the extra tracks are.  Jeff Lynne is a genius.  And so are the rest.
B000IHY9SE|2.0|Hardest hitting songs are Jimmy Crack Corn, Pistol Pistol, and Public Enemy #1. The rest are either decent or below par really. Just download those 3 on  I-TUnes and you have the highlights of the CD.
B000RZIGZ4|5.0|A great movie being made available in it's finest presentation.     Surround sound effects are amazing, and the picture quality is awesome, even for a movie this old. Combat scenes really come to life, and you can see things in the background super clearly. For example papers on the board when the guys are waiting around to take a shower.     Shame people gotta vote bad for the movie just cause it's HD DVD exclusive.    I am a high def enthusiast and love watching everything I can in HD. I chose the HD DVD format for it's price, picture, interactivity, and the fact that players can be upgraded via the ethernet port.    All these Blu Ray babies crying, really need to get a life. Paramount, Dreamworks seen the light and seen that there are 3 to 1 HD DVD players over Blu Ray players in American households. Consumers are going to buy what is affordable and movie studios are going to go where they can make the most profit. Also, it is more profitable to make an HD DVD disc over a Blu Ray disc, as HD DVD uses similar technolgy shared with DVD.     It's been noted that the BD Java code needed to write Blu Ray disc is alot more complicated than the Microsoft HDi code used to writing HD DVD. In turn it makes HD DVD have much more features and come out with less bugs than Blu Ray. This makes HD DVD more profitable for the simple reason that studios don't have to pay programers to learn a new code for making movies.    Plus do you really think that Sony didn't grease Disney's pocket to go exclusive with Blu Ray?    Bottom line is technology is made for consumers and Sony has always tried to make it proprietary for them. Examples, mini disc, umd, memory stick, betamax, atrac3 (music format) and blu ray. Look at all the failed formats Sony has tried to push onto consumers that have all failed. Did you really think it would be different with Blu Ray?
B000EGCITG|5.0|I have to admit this is my very first P!NK CD. I was actually looking for Gwen Stefani's latest CD and happend upon P!NK's I'm Not Dead album/CD. And it was the last one left (and the edited version).  And I have to say I play Pink's CD WAAAAAAYYY more than I do Gwen Stefani's. There's just 2 songs on the CD that I really didn't like as much as the rest.  I am just blown away by her powerful songs and voice! I like a gal who speaks her mind and don't give a d*** what other people think! My top 3 Faves on this CD: Who Knew, Leave Me Alone, U + UR Hand<br /><br />Can't wait for her Next CD!!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|An excellent movie I think.<br />I believe in love and I believe that what you are watching here happens all the time all over the world.<br />I think it's important that our world gives more importance to this four letters RAVE (respect appreciate value everyone) Because this movie is acctualy telling us the possible results of someone who is not ready to be trully himself because of the fears of the society.<br />Hope you like it as much as I do.<br />It's kindda sad at the end but very good movie though.
0790729369|5.0|When I went to see this movie in the theatre years ago, I was so sure that I wasn't going to like this film.  There was a loud rumbling in the romance community about this story being written by a man.  At the time there were a lot of them.  This one, Message in a Bottle and a Walk to Remember shortly after.  So there I was in all my huffy glory, glaring at the screen. But all that nonesense was forgotten as this wonderful story started to unfold.  Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep had me smiling and melting in this forbidden love story in no time flat.  By the time we reach the scene where Eastwood is standing in the middle of the street during a rain down pour, I was begging her to get out the car.  Run, girl.  Run to your true soul mate!  Ah, amour.  So despite my prejudices I fell helplessly in love with this story--and you will too.  Highly recommended.
081541028X|5.0|I read this when it was first published, and read it again twice. It's wonderful - it gives you a sense of what the astronaut program was like, what it was intended to do, and what it did. And above all, a great appreciation for pioneers - anyone who's willing to go into the unknown.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|I have to say that I am not familiar with any Ghost Rider comics, games or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not \\"know\\" Johnny Blaze prior to the film I have to say that the movie was pretty good!  Ghost Rider brings to the screen the story of a young man who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for curing his father's cancer.  There are slight hints of the X-Files, and strong/obvious elements of the Ninth Gate (starring Johnny Depp), Constantine (starring Keanu Reeves), and the Prophecy trilogy (starring Christopher Walkin), so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.   Nicolas Cage and most of the rest of the cast carry out their performances well (Blackheart and Mephistopheles could have been played much better).   The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the music, and the special effects, are all good.  Ghost Rider is a movie guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In short, I would definitely line up to watch a sequel!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Just finished watching this movie and was not sure what to expect.  Would it be good or just a POC?  It is FABULOUS!!  Paul Mercurio is HOT!  Yeah, the plot is kinda cliche, but who cares when you get to see some authentic Spanish dancing.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This particular version of Hamlet on film is one of the best adaptations out there.  True in all forms to the original dialog, the filmmaker takes very little creative license in recreating this theatrical masterpiece.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I am not new to the TV Shows on DVD galaxy.  Besides Survivor I watch every show on DVD.  I hardly ever watch TV.  Supernatural has become a very rare wonder of a TV show.  I saw season one a year ago and am highly anticipating the arrival of season two.  It is very rare to find a show as good as this one.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Pixar has a knack for churning out movies that are great for kids, but also amusing enough that adults can enjoy them too.  Cars is another great example of this.<br /><br />As well, I recommend that you check out the special features and the mini documentary on Route 66.  Fascinating tale of a bygone era that inspired a lot of the art of the movie.
B000VAPZM2|4.0|I was excited to see this sequel production of High School Musical 2.  I am a Mom and teacher who really enjoys these \\"innocent-like\\" shows.  I actually liked it better than my 17 yr old daughter.  She said it was corny and untrue to life.  However, I really liked the resort they filmed this at, and the storyline.  It is true to life on Troy's struggle for his identity, as with all teens.  I really like Lucas, who played Sharpay's brother.  He is sooooooo talented.  I really liked him in the baseball musical number. He is an excellent singer and a wonderful dancer.  I wish him a lot more success.  I would have liked to have seen the heavy-set girl do more.  She is a very talented dancer and singer.  She was always in the background.  It is also good to have non-skinny actors in these movies, because everyone is not 104lbs.  I, also, thought that the pool song number with sharpay was very clever.  It shows a lot of work was put into it.    I ,also, like these characters and these movies because the characters of Troy and Gabriella are very much like the Beach Blanket Bingo set of the 50's & 60's with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello.  As a matter of fact, Vannessa, who plays Gabriella, is just like Annette! America needs simpler and sweeter shows like these!
B00003CXAY|1.0|...    These movies don't even come close to 'Baraka'. The images are of less quality and do not draw you in. The 'background music' has become a barrier between the images you see and the feelings they could have created. Instead of showing the images with the natural sounds that go with them, there's a feeling of disconnect as the eyes see one thing, but the ears hear other, unrelated, audio 'clues'.   Even though the director is Francis Ford Coppola, do not be fooled in expecting high quality. There is a strong impression he made the movie during his lunch hour while concentrating on another film.   Both movies suffer from the same visual/audio disconnect. If you want to spent the same amount of money in this category, but two 'Baraka' movies and give one to a dear friend.
B000005RMJ|4.0|In 1997, Rick Davies, Mark Hart, John Helliwell and Bob Siebenberg re-formed  Supertramp to release \\"Some things never change\\"; their first album in almost ten years; and as the title say, things never change; Supertramp is Supertramp. The music is super tight, great Piano, Guitar, Saxophone and perfectly great singing.<br />If you are an old fan of Supertramp, this CD is a must own.<br />Their latest album \\"Slow motion\\" is also excellent.<br />If you are new to Supertramp start instead with \\"Crime of the Century\\" and \\"Breakfast in America\\"

Junior was readin' his comic books.  The cold snap had passed and we was hopin' for a good crop ... and then...well let me tell you.    Them things was comin' at us everywhere.  One of 'em looked just like Uncle Billy, but hell he's been dead six months now.  The dogs were goin' nuts.  I grabbed the shotgun from behind the front door and started shootin'.  Didn't faze 'em a bit.    Junior kept yelling, \\"Shoot 'em in the head Pa! Shoot 'em in the head!\\"    That's when I dropped Uncle Billy.  I knew it was him later on cause he was wearin' his favorite Hawayun shirt.    Well, let me tell you .......    AND ON IT GOES.  AN ORAL HISTORY OF WORLD WAR Z !!!

B00005JPVN|4.0|This film is what the movie Crank wishes it was. A clever action movie with wit and an insane body count. Clive Owen owns this role as expected, and Paul Giamatti makes for an interesting villian. Monica Bellucci is eye candy for sure, but provides little else. There is almost no let up in the pace and the rock tunes really fit the many action scenes. People in my theater were going nuts over some of the gags.<br /><br />While I felt 3:10 to Yuma was a better film, Shoot 'Em Up was even more fun to watch. Two very good movies in one weekend. Thats gotta be some kind of record.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars
0316067598|5.0|This book provided insight into experiences most of us can't even imagine much less live through. I am grateful that Marcus Luttrell took the time and effort to tell his story and that of his SEAL teammates. Without stories like these, we may not have any idea what really goes on in the conflicts America is currently involved in. I read a few of the one star reviews because I was shocked that anyone would rate it as such- I can't even relate to how they feel. This is someone who lived through hell and acted with profound bravery, and with the good forture/grace of god/whatever you may believe, was able to live through this to show respect for people he would die for- to all Americans who he almost died for, and give us some idea of the enemy we are up against and the bravery fought by our men and women in the military. I am very grateful.     I especially appreciated his opinion about the media.  He was right about the stories reporting presumptions as facts that had no regard for the truth nor the effects on the family. I have seen this with the reporting on Walter Reed- forget all the importance that has happened in that miraculous hospital and go for the big story making it up as you go along. What happened to integrity in journalism? But that's another story.     Thank you Marcus Luttrell, for telling your story.

0974869449|3.0|But to me, using software instead of paper flashcards makes a lot more sense. So these are collecting dust with other books while I review my vocabulary and kanji in a program.<br /><br />>>Update by popular request:<br />I use Stackz! and I create the lists myself, using the Japanese IME (Input method) that came with Windows. It's been a while since my review, but I still haven't found a use for these physical cards, while I use Stackz! to review the writing of the kanji (with a list I created from \\"Remembering The Kanji\\") and some vocabulary (which I typed from the Japanese For Busy People series) every weekend. The Stackz! page has a lot of lists created by its users, even some JLPT lists, so perhaps you won't have to create a list from scratch.<br /><br />Electronic flashcards are a lot better because you can use \\"spaced reviews\\", which effectively simulate the way human memory works. The more you review something, the less frequently you need to review it again. You can review a word one day after learning it, then 2 days, 4, 8, etc. This principle was popularized by Sebastian Leitner in the 70s and is today the basis for many language learning courses and software, including Pimsleur's.<br /><br />The principle was integrated in Stackz! under the name \\"repeat advisor\\" and the spacing of each successive review is fully adjustable. You can follow Sebastian Leitner's method for classifying the cards after review (if you fail, it goes to the starting stack again), or the more forgiving \\"Stackz classic\\" method.<br /><br />For this scientific study method to be successful with physical cards, you would have to write the date of the last review over it, and keep track of when you have to review it again, while avoiding to see the contents!... and each card needs to have only one question on one side (for example, a single word written in Kanji) and the answer on the other side (in this case, the kana reading and the translation). It is impossible to follow the method with cards that have more than one question (in this case, a word) printed. And it would be too cumbersome to handle such an amount of physical cards. It would be way too complex to try to keep such a record and neatly arranged stacks, too.<br /><br />So, since a long time has passed since the 70s, computers came to help, and computer-assisted language learning adopted Leitner's principle. Take advantage of it. Check the \\"Flashcard\\" article on the Wikipedia.<br /><br />You can use any good electronic flashcard software that fits your needs: Some are more automatic and some are more \\"manual\\". Shop around, read reviews and gambatte kudasai!<br /><br />If you do want physical cards after all, these are the best.

B000T46O8O|3.0|I was planning this to be a funny movie, because the main actor is only in comedy movies. I would suggest this to be rented but it wasn't good enough for me to buy and watch over and over again... There was a good plot, but I expected better.
B00003CX5P|3.0|After putting off this purchase for years, I finally walked to the store and got my copy. I was disappointed.<br /><br />The image was transfered from film, which makes no sense to me. It has the typical dust, scratches, overexposure and over-sharpening problems of a scan from film. I guess back in 2001 when everyone had small TVs no one noticed, but I have a 70\\" screen and, compared to the Episode III DVD, the image quality in this one sucks.<br /><br />I know Episode I was the last Star Wars flick shot with film instead of digital cameras, but, come on, it was edited in computers! It makes no sense to further degrade the image by transferring it from digital to film and then back to digital... unless you are planning to re-release it as a \\"Digitally remastered\\" version for the 10th anniversary (Which I hope they do, along with the HD DVD and Blu-ray versions)

0743554450|5.0|\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a beautifully written story of two Afghan women brought together by their marriage to an emotionally and physically abusive man.  I listend to its nicely produced audio version during my morning work drive, and the book was so involving and so depressing to me that I just felt horrible about everything for days.<br />At certain points I was convinced that the author hated his characters--why else would he have them suffer so much--and at others, I realized he was merely trying to show the world the horrible reality of many women's lives in the Middle East.<br />I think this book is amazing, but I honestly don't know if I would ever inflict it upon myself again.  It is so full of pain, and its characters seem so real, that it was really just too much for me at times.<br />Read it, but be warned that it could affect you powerfully.

B000QXDED6|4.0|\\"300\\" renders the doomed stand of King Leonides and his 300 Spartan warriors at Thermopylae against an invading Persian horde as grand and exciting modern myth, in the graphic style of \\"Sin City\\", also the brain-child of graphic novelist Frank Miller.<br /><br />The movie opens with a short prologue that introduces us to King Leonides and to the Spartan warrior ethic.  The story properly gets underway with the arrival of a Persian emissary demanding the submission of Sparta to King Xerxes of Persia, self-styled god and ruler of the world.  Leonides tosses the emissary into a pit by way of answer.<br /><br />Complications arise as King Leonides prepares to face the invading horde.  A member of the Spartan Council, in the pay of the Persians, prevents him from taking the Spartan Army to seize and hold a key piece of terrain at Thermopylae (the \\"Hot Gates\\"), a narrow pass.  Leonides instead takes 300 picked warriors, knowing his mission is likely suicidal but believing the time gained in slowing down the Persians is necessary to rally the Greeks.<br /><br />The stand by the \\"300\\" at the \\"Hot Gates\\" is dramatic, epic, and incredibly gory, but also a rousing display of defiance by the free warriors of Sparta and their allies against a Persian Army composed of slaves.<br /><br />Some highlights of the movie: the voice-over narration by the surviving member of Leonides' small force, without which some aspects of the Greek culture might seem opaque; the brotherhood unto death of the Spartan warriors; the excellent performance by Lena Headey as Leonides' spouse, equal parts loving wife and tough-minded queen; and the dramatic landscapes and special effects made possible by the overlay of animation on real actors.<br /><br />A few quibbles: The Persians are rendered as vaguely African in appearence; the blood and gore almost overwhelm the storyline at times; and the too-easy departure from the standard telling of this semi-legendary event.  The decisive Greek victory over the Persians at Platea that followed Thermopylae is almost an afterthought.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to those with an interest in a remarkable, graphically original rendering of an ancient story with a moral still valid for the present day.pylae is almost an afterthought.

0066620996|5.0|Not just a restatement of company statistics or financial reports, this book offers critical analysis of successful and very successful companies and the strategies and tactics that produced the differences. The author goes to great length to explain why some companies do just OK, and why others are great successes. The analysis is very useful to my business.

But what this book does is show us how to use the Law of Attraction consciously for the things that are still eluding us, whether it's for easier finances, health, weight loss, relationships or world peace.  Everyone should read this book.

0446677450|4.0|For better or worse, and despite its relative youth, it should be fair to note that by now Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a classic of the genre. Self-made millionaire Robert T. Kiyosaki, and his co-author Sharon L. Lechter, has written about the former's first-hand experience and opinions on making lots of money and retiring early. The book interestingly applies lessons learnt from Kiyosaki's own father and an inspiring rich father figure - who might or might not have actually existed despite the claim of this being a \\"real story\\" - to elucidate and expand on the author's theories. While Kiyosaki senior was a scholar and a government employee, he was a man of modest means with financial and job stability problems. The 'rich dad', in contrast, lacked formal education, but managed and grew a business empire. This man, also took his own son and Robert under his wings in Hawaii and imparted the lessons that form the basis for this book.<br /><br />Rightly or wrongly, the notion that a formal school or college education is not the ticket should displease many. Rich Dad, Poor Dad is foremost for people who share the author's goal of making money over a formal and structured education or community and civic respect. It does bear reminding that not everybody craves material riches and a Porsche or Porsche-like luxury. If you, however, are a budding capitalist then this book is a very good starting point. The insistence that one has to become materially rich is a given here. It contains both motivational and tactical examples of how to proceed, although both are presented at a relatively high-level. Lists are provided, systematic manuals or specifics are not. The advice is a motivational invitation to think differently and look at life with a different set of eyes.<br /><br />The author does advise financial, sales, marketing and legal knowledge as prerequisites and suggests income-yielding investments as the means to wealth. Stocks, additional real estate and other dividend-yielding vehicles are espoused over assets that depreciate. The author labels collecting objects as counterproductive to wealth and as liabilities. This is contradictory to most people's assumptions that a car, fridge, one's own house or university degrees are assets on one's balance sheet. Furthermore, the book separates the habits of the habitually 'poor' and habitually 'wealthy' with the former preferring safety, ignorance of investment vehicles or the law and abhorring money, while the latter take risks, think and calculate. The attributes of the rich are what the author reckons is needed to accumulate money. Loving one's job is not exactly a virtue in these pages. Being worried about losing money, cynical about potential and lazy are derided as keeping one poor. Paying taxes is also abhorred and labelled as \\"paying the government,\\" although why exactly paying to have healthcare, roads, a civic city or a clean environment is not paying and taking care of oneself or one's future is not logically clear.<br /><br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad is motivational and also quite brash. The habits, as described, ring true and sound genuinely smart. Nevertheless, experienced investors or those looking for detailed descriptions and techniques will be disappointed. Instead, as mentioned, starting or reenergized capitalists are sure to fall in love here.espoused over assets that depreciate.

If you don't already have this album, do yourself a favor and get it, NOW!!!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This two-disc set collects highlights of Johnny Cash's short-lived musical variety show, which aired on network TV between 1969-71.  At the peak of the hippies-vs.-straights culture clash, Cash boldly invited guests from across the American musical spectrum -- longhairs, country traditionalists, Nashville insiders, jazz musician, rock stars, pop tunesmiths and folkies. The guest list is truly astonishing, given the tensions of the times.  Bob Dylan -- one of Cash's favorite artists -- was on the first show in '69, tipping viewers off that this wasn't gonna be your typical country TV show. Appearances by Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Wonder and John Fogerty followed, as well as master entertainers such as Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles.  And of course, there was the cream of the country crop -- Waylon Jennings, Ray Price, Marty Robbins, George Jones, Loretta Lynn and Johnny's crew from his road show -- June Carter Cash & the Carter Family, the Statler Brothers, Carl Perkins and others.  In the wings were some amazing sidemen: keep an eye out for Norman Blake plucking acoustic guitar, as well as the wealth of up-and-coming talent that Cash went out of his way to promote (notably Kris Kristofferson, who reminisces about the old shows in interview segments added in this DVD set...)<br /><br />This is a great collection, generously programmed (the set list on the Menu  goes on for page after page...) and many of the performances are pure gold (George Jones is awesome!)  Some fans will complain that they'd rather see the original shows as broadcast at the time, and while I agree that that would be fun, I don't see any reason to give anything but praise to this set.  The documentary format, with various Cash crew and compatriots interviewed and introducing different segments, is kinda cool, and for the most part they know when to get out of the way and let the music play.  It's a pity they didn't shoot the whole TV show on film -- some of the video stock gets kinda flared out (the Dylan clips, in particular) but, hey -- that's history for you.  Personally, I'm glad to see whatever stuff like this there is -- it's a great look back at an interesting cultural moment, when mainstream country was still pretty traditional, although the walls were starting to fall and new influences were coming into play.  Cash fans and country fans alike will want to check this one out! (DJ Joe Sixpack)eo stock gets kinda flared out (the Dylan clips, in particular) but, hey -- that's history for you.

B0006AAS5G|5.0|This is my 2nd Invicta watch but unfortunately lost it in Phi Phi Island while making a dive off the yacht. I bought it after owning the legendary 8926 and was amazed by the quality and the feel for that price. For those who complain about the subdials not working I recommend you read the manual, the 24 hour subdial is suppose to work with the main watch to show you if its day or night just like the GMT watches.    Am I going to buy another one? Sure I am.
0770430074|4.0|This book is evidence that to see God, one has to believe in him.  That is why this book failed me in that respect, but I still found this book a worthwhile read.  But I did have a few minor complaints.<br /><br />Chapter II was too long.  The survival story with the tiger on the raft dragged on too long.  There were too many \\"bone-crushing\\" scenes that left me a little uneasy.<br /><br />But otherwise, for originality and creativity, I give this book high marks.  I will also add that I do believe the secondary version of this story, revealed in Chapter III, is most likely the real story, which makes the symbolic analogies in the preceding pages more coherent.  I also appreciated the author's added descriptions of animal behavior and habitats noteworthy.<br /><br />Although I don't understand what the big ruckus was about this book, I did find it an enjoyable read and a book worthy of a discussion group afterwards.  I don't think this story is strictly a religious tale.  Anyone with faith and devotion would relate to this book.
B000HDJFX8|5.0|I would like to thank fellow reviewer \\"Smallchief\\" for steering me to this specific LeCarre novel. This is my second novel by the famous spy writer.<br /><br />John LeCarre was born on October 19, 1931. He studied foreign languages at the University of Berne, then studied at Lincoln College, Oxford. He graduated with a B.A.in 1956. Eventually, and well after graduation, and after some years of geovernment service, he was recruited into MI6. He wrote his first novel in 1961, while still a member of MI6. His career as a secret agent was destroyed by Kim Philby, a British double agent, who blew the cover of dozens of British agents.<br /><br />In the present and probably one of his most famous novels, Le Carre writes a similar story about \\"Gerald\\", the mole hunted by George Smiley. The  fictional spymaster George Smiley was modelled on former Lincoln rector Vivian H. H. Green. Most of LeCarre's novels fall into the spy-thriller genre, and he is considered the leading 20th century writer of such works.<br /><br />His stories are about people, not technology and gadgets in the James Bond style. They are slow moving affairs, and that is true of the present novel which takes about 100 pages to get going as an interesting read. The novel ramps up slowly, but by the last 50 pages one cannot put the novel down.<br /><br />I stll do not understand exactly how Smiley has solved the case after reading the last 90 pages twice, but we can chalk that up to literature as art.<br /><br />This is an excellent 5 star read.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|If I knew this was the the only way ever I could buy the original 3 films as released in the cinema I would buy these discs.<br /><br />I've just borrowed this one from a friend and the original version on disc 2 is in 2.35 - 1 letterbox (no problem with that) but not anamorphic (why?). This means those of us who own widescreen TV's have to either watch a tiny image to get the best quality picture or zoom it out and lose quality. No thanks I'll take the chance and wait.<br /><br />The quality of the disc 2 original is OK, but you need to know that the picture is not anamorphic. What this means in simple terms is that on a widescreen TV you get black bars top and bottom as well as right and left, unless you use your TV's zoom option.<br /><br />Next year is the 30th anniversary and George Lucas may do us all a favour next year and release the originals as they were supposed to be seen.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is an ultimate goldmine for holdouts pining for the full series set! I've had an almost complete collection of the original Twin Peaks broadcasts in my videotape collection for many years. (I'm missing the episode where Josie Packard somehow becomes one with the wood grain, or whatever - not sure if that's a spoiler or even what happened because I haven't seen that episode since it was broadcast in '91.) So it's been a long wait to replace those old worn tapes (complete with ancient pre-web commercials) and in the meantime I've seen and collected most of Mr. Lynch's features (and some shorts recently shown on TCM.) It'll be a real pleasure to meet up with the ever-mysterious TP gang once again and while I worshipped TP and continue to fervently await my pre-order to be filled by Amazon (appropriately around Halloween), I hope that those reading this have also moved on to see his other wonderful works too, especially Mulholland Dr., the definitive movie about Los Angeles (I was living in the middle of Hollywood when I first saw it) and The Straight Story.

B000PHX8C0|5.0|To say that Dez Fafara has come a long ways since debuting with his first band (ill-fated nu-metal act Coal Chamber) would be a vast understatement. It's hard to believe that just ten years ago, Dez Fafara was shamelessly spouting ridiculous dribble (like repeating \\"me so loco\\" again and again) over moronically simplistic, Korn-copped riffs. But now, a short decade later, Dez is all growed up, and is in a second band, Devildriver, who have released an unbelievably brutal album which officially shuts the doors on his amateurish nu-metal roots forever. That album is this year's \\"The Last Kind Words.\\" This is, without question, Devildriver's strongest, meanest and most realized and energetic release yet, and it is also the best piece of music Mr. Fafara has ever attached his name to.<br /><br />Neither Dez nor his band have ever sounded hungrier than they do now. \\"TLKW\\" has a wonderful, raw urgency to it, as if the band recorded the whole thing at gunpoint. But that doesn't mean Devildriver didn't still have a lot of fun making this record. They clearly delight in tearing the listener's head off with an uncompromising avalanche of great, fiery riffs, busy, nimble-fingered leads, deft, pummeling blast beats, and visceral, raging vocals.<br /><br />Everybody is at the top of his game here. The musicianship is impeccable and almost impossibly tight. Axemen Mike Spreitzer and Jeff Kendrick are particularly awesome - not only are their riffs and leads highly technical, but they have learned how to solo, too! Quite a few lengthy, tastefully clean solos are sprinkled on throughout these eleven cuts, thus giving some melody and harmony to the otherwise chaotic musical arrangements. Jason Suecof is also worthy of special mention for turning in an excellent production job (probably the best and clearest of his career thus far.) As a result, the listener can hear and absorb every second of the onslaught -- including guitar feedback and crashing high hats -- very well.<br /><br />From front to back, the album never loses any steam -- the intensity level stays in the red for the duration. Plus, these eleven tracks never lose their focus, either, so the album is very consistent. And as a triple threat, it's super catchy, too! Devildriver never forsake catchiness; no matter how heavy or intense a song gets, they always remember to slip in a bunch of memorable hooks and infectious grooves. A case in point is the driving, breakneck set opener, \\"Not All Who Wonder All Lost,\\" which boasts a deep, Pantera or Lamb of God-worthy groove tattooed with rapid-fire drums. Two very tasty, ripping, and melodic solos also crop up here. Elsewhere, \\"Bound By The Moon\\" and \\"When Summoned\\" (to name just a couple) are other prime cuts of riff-choked, face-ripping thrash; and Dez's livid, maniacal lyrics and vicious, venomous bellows on \\"Horn Of Betrayal\\" will make you think the flesh is being torn off your bones.<br /><br />But it isn't all the same song, because there's plenty of dynamic to be heard, as well. For example, take \\"Clouds Over California\\" and \\"These Fighting Words\\": both break up the monotony and give the listener a little room to breathe with slow, mounting energy build-ups. But give it only about half a minute and both of the songs are waist deep in full-on, foaming-at-the-mouth thrash -- the former with pounding, jackhammering blasts, and the latter with excellent, blistering riffage. \\"Tirades Of Truth\\" is the only entirely mid-tempo song, and even it has a great, palpable tension and bristles with crunchy guitars and catchy, moshable choruses.<br /><br />Devildriver aren't set out to reinvent the wheel or disprove anybody who says they're one-dimensional, but those things are almost effortlessly easy to overlook when the album is, overall, this satisfying, contagious, exhilarating, and addictive. \\"The Last Kind Words\\" delivers the goods, plain and simple.

B000M39SYE|5.0|When one looks into a mirror, he or she sees his/her person in its true form. The reflection shows everything the viewer wants to see. After looking into the relfection, the viewer can have a varied number of reactions - basically either pleasureable or displeasing.     All subjects that face a mirror have either of these two characteristics -whether it be a person, a group of people or an entire society. And it is the same with America.    Michael Moore provides a \\"mirror\\" to current American society that many in his country do not appreciate. Why? He moves the \\"mirror\\" around the subject and shows the defects of his society (as in all societies). \\"A prophet is never welcome in his own country\\", so the saying goes, and it will be a matter of time before his views on this controversial matter are truly examined.
B000OPOANE|5.0|I just purchased this Limited Edition DVD a couple weeks ago and I really like it. It offers High Definition Audio in both a 5.1 mix and also as a stereo mix. The disc also contains mp3 files at 192 KBps that are ready to put onto your player or you could use them to make a standard CD as this is a DVD and will not play in CD player.  One of the main reasons I purchased it was because of the Documentary about the making of the album at Allaire Studios. I love it, and it is similar in style to the documentary on the Rush in Rio DVD set (The Boys in Brazil). Any Rush nut like myself will thoroughly enjoy the documentary.  The music is great and after you watch the documentary you will want to play the songs again.  I definitely recommend this to anyone and especially to Rush fans.

B000PHX8C0|3.0|\\"Last Kind Words\\", the third album from Devil Driver (led by former Coal Chamber frontman Dez Fafara), continues the pounding, headbanging tradition of good 'ol American metal goodness.  That being said, while \\"Last Kind Words\\" is a fine metal release, it's nothing we haven't heard before, and nothing that moves beyond the promise that Devil Driver displayed since their formation.  Now this may not be such a bad thing for some listeners, but you can only ride a one trick pony so many times before it starts getting stale.  \\"These Fighting Words\\" and \\"Burning Sermon\\" sound oddly familiar, while \\"Clouds Over California\\", \\"Bound by the Moon\\", and the closing \\"The Axe Shall Fall\\" are instantly enjoyable.  Despite a lack of freshness, the guitars are wonderfully grinding, the drumming is brutal, Dez sounds better than he has with his monstrous growl, and the band as a whole is still better than Coal Chamber was during their entire tenure.  So while \\"Last Kind Words\\" is a pretty solid slab of metal listening, be forewarned that there's nothing here you haven't heard before and heard better, and here's hoping that Devil Driver will only improve on their efforts so far, and deliver to us the metal gospel that they have previously shown so much promise in delivering.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|An indication of a good film lies in its ability to entertain and convince viewers on a multitude of levels. It's never easy to achieve that in films not to mention in animated ones. Brad Bird succeeds once again with Ratatouille after the great-beyond-measure The Incredibles.<br /><br />Despite an unconvincing main character which is a low-down rat and a talentless son of a cook, the animated film manages to fill each and every scene with action and fun, something that is bound to keep kids riveted. On a higher level, the storyline will appeal to adults in its subtle complexity. It speaks of nature vs nurture (are rats are forever condemned to being thieves), believing in oneself's aspirations (Anyone can cook even a street rat), imagine and create (Gusteau: I'm a figment of your imagination...If you're focused on what you've left behind, you will not be able to see what lies ahed. Now go up, and look around!). The dialogues are witty and of course, the animation is superb.<br /><br />At the end of Ratatouille, you would have experienced failure and then emerge hopeful. It's a must-see for 2007! (A)

B000SO7OMA|5.0|A truly remarkable concert! After a very difficult and stressful week, I got this CD/DVD package in the mail, smiled, and, with surprising calmness, walked to the living room, slid the DVD into my MacBook Pro, parked my Sennheiser HD-485 headphones on my ears, and sat back, letting the visceral experience of this incredibly talented woman wash over me, taking the stresses of the week away and reminding me how important smart, beautiful, heart-felt, literate music is to my spirit.     I've long been a fan of Loreena, yet had never seen her in concert. I was blown away by her multi-instrument acumen, her almost effortless singing while reaching those crystalline, soaring notes that reach through me and make my nerves tingle up and down my spine, her rapport with the very talented band, and, most of all, that serene smile that creases her face as her body sways with the rhythm that demonstrates how much the music carries her to a profoundly peaceful, quietly joyful place.     It's a bit embarrassing, me gushing on and on like this, something I so rarely indulge in. Yet this music, this musician (and the talented, delightful band supporting her), this production, the setting... They warrant this kind of effusive praise. Even with all of her CD's in my library, this addition is not superfluous nor extravagant: it is, in fact, essential to see the whole of Loreena's remarkable talent, heart, and unique sound.     I'm not terribly enamored of the happy-happy/bliss-bliss affectations of much that is categorized as \\"new age\\", particularly those individuals who purport to \\"channel\\" ancient spirits, while I can't help but speculate that some artists do indeed channel the vibrations, or whatever you might call it, in a pure and profound way, and often in spite of themselves. Lowell George, Yo Yo Ma, Bobby McFerrin, the band Lo'Jo, and many more, among them the beloved Lorenna: music that is timeless, almost archetypal, imbued with both heart and intellect, and beautiful to listen to, over and over.     Thank you, Loreena.
B000GL3MIU|5.0|Amazon.com<br />V for Vendetta is, like its author's later Watchmen, a landmark in comic-book writing. Alan Moore has led the field in intelligent, politically astute (if slightly paranoid), complex adult comic-book writing since the early 1980s. He began V back in 1981 and it constituted one of his first attempts (along with the criminally neglected but equally superb Miracleman) at writing an ongoing series. It is 1998 (which was the future back then!) and a Fascist government has taken over the U.K. The only blot on its particular landscape is a lone terrorist who is systematically killing all the government personnel associated with a now destroyed secret concentration camp. Codename V is out for vengeance ... and an awful lot more. V feels slightly dated like all past premonitions do. The original series was black and white and that added to the grittiness of the feel while the coloring here in the graphic novel sometimes blurs David Lloyd's fine drawing. But these are small concerns. Skillfully plotted, V is an essential read for all those who love comics and the freedom, as a medium, they allow a writer as skilled as Moore. --Mark Thwaite --This text refers to the Paperback edition.<br /><br />From School Library Journal<br />Grade 9 Up-The date is November 5th, 1997. War has ravaged England, entire races have been eradicated, the entire British populace is under constant surveillance, and the absolute power is absolutely corrupt. On this historic day, a man with a strong resemblance to Guy Fawkes (in action and dress) blows up Parliament. The bomber, a masked character named V, saves a girl named Eve from a violent crime and takes her under his wing. Moore's dystopian, fascist version of England, ruled by one central leader and his sects (named after parts of the body, such as Finger, Nose, and Voice), is systematically dismantled by the enigmatic V. Readers must ultimately decide if V is a mad anarchist/terrorist or a freedom-fighting avenger for good. Originally published in 1989, V has been reissued as a hardcover book with never-seen-before sketches and two new vignettes. This story is slated to be released as a major motion picture in 2006, and demand should intensify as the movie trailers come out. Combining alternate history with moral questions about freedom and identity, this book would work well in a school setting; and while there is some slight nudity and violence, they fit well within the framework of the story.-Jennifer Feigelman, Plattekill Public Library, Modena, NY<br />Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris has gotten it right on some parts but he should read Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason. When it comes to God he is throwing the baby out with the bath water. Secularistic intellectulism is not enough, because it is not shared on a common basis. Man is not a Noble Savage who can exist without reason and spiritualism. Some people need to have organized religion in their life, they are just not capable of functioning and dealing with life, without something to believe in. They need than mores and norms to avoid reverting back to a more barbaristic state. There is nothing wrong with hope and faith, it is when men get caught up in using religious mythologys to further their own political and economic gains, resulting in centuries of wars, conquests and slaughter that insanity prevails. I defend anyones right to believe in whatever they chose, as long as they respect my right not to share their belief. An athiest who believs that our modern intellect, and shared prosperity are going to some how lead us into an Age of Reason is engaged in failed logic. America and the free world is in a war with militant Islamists that it cannot avoid; one that it cannot talk or appease its way out of; one in which our irreconcilable Islamist foes will have to be killed, an act which unavoidably will lead to innocent deaths.  Bin Laden offer us the same choice, convert, give up democracy or die.

Once again, Springsteen demonstrates brilliant insight into a variety of subject matters. He masterfully combines driving rhythms with astute observations about the vast wasteland of modern rock music.

B000P0J024|5.0|Plastic Ono Band o Wings?, Imagine o Band On The Run? Yoko o Linda? Los fanaticos se arañan y defienden a morir a los sobrevalorados Lennon y McCartney, le encienden velas al martir cada diciembre y se lanzan a las calles a llorarlo por enesima vez. Con conciertos que tocan mas canciones de McCartney que la del mismo homenajeado. Cada uno en su trinchera, como fanaticos de algun equipo deportivo. Salen corriendo a comprarle al Sir su ultimo disco, en la que una vez mas, nos quiere demostar que el lo puede todo. Tocar la bateria, el bajo, el piano, el bandolin, la guitarra, etc, etc. Lo sabemos Paul, eres los maximo, no nececitamos que nos lo demuestres, pero por favor, concentrate en componer buenas canciones y tocar tu bajo, tu guitarra o tu piano, pero no cometas otra vez el error de querer hacerlo tu todo. O es que acaso no te basto con destrozar a los beatles con tus ataques de egocentrico insoportable?    Traveling Wilburys fue un grupo que se formo de pura casualidad, solo querian un lado B para una de las canciones del Cloud Nine de George, y de ahi nacio todo, la pasaron tan bien, que resultaron con un album, y años despues con otro que no llego al nivel del primero. A diferencia de John y Paul, George no perdia el sueño en formar un grupo que iguale a los Beatles, en verdad, no lo habra nunca jamas, y es cierto tambien que si no fuera por los Beatles, Harrison no existiria en la escena musical, o quien sabe. Traveling Wilburys es solo una reunion de amigos, que la quieren pasar bien. Tocar buena musica, y nada mas. Al contrario de Plastic Ono Band o Wings, ninguno de los integrantes de Traveling Wilburys tenia la intencion de ser el lider, el jefe de la banda. Tal vez por eso le tengo mas cariño a este grupo. Dejar de lado el ego, y ser uno mas dentro de la banda.    En verdad se han tomado mucho tiempo en lanzar esta coleccion de discos que era muy dificil encontrar, ahora el sonido esta remasterizado y suena perfecto. Ha valido la espera, y ahora aquiestan los Wilburys para la nueva gereracion, esa generacion que detesta el reggaeton, grupetes como RBD o todo aquel adefecio sonoro que suena o pretenda sonar en las radios en estos dias.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|I've been a fan since 1967. I grew up in Los Angeles during the '60s, and always loved their music.  A couple of years ago, The Robbie Krieger Band performed in Orangevale,CA. 3 blocks from my home. They played all the old Doors tunes. Robbie's guitar playing was awesome.   I'm about halve way through CD2, and hear no problem with vocals or music. Now if he's sloshed on the remaining tracks, WHO CARES.   Its Jim Morrison boozed up or sober. Get a life, it isn't 1971, its almost 2008, the real deal with Jim alive on stage, with the all the members. I have Live in Detroit, and other live performances. Yes, the vocals are more clearer.  I enjoyed, Live in Boston so far. These reviews are way too critical  My age is 54.
0783240236|4.0|Seems everyone thinks this is such a classic and hardly no criticism at all. I agree the photography was terrific. Especially when Melanie was on the water approaching the house.<br />What I found a bit off was Jessica Tandy's over-acting to the extreme. This is the same Driving Miss Daisy actress? The male lead was typical Hollywood Leading Man. And those pants, he could have hid inside his pants from the birds.<br />I just chuckled at the fact these people couldn't fight off a few sea gulls pecking at their backs. Also, I was left in the dark as to why the birds acted this way? Is it because mankind is over-crowding their territory?<br />Don't get me wrong, it was completely engaging and filmed wonderfully. 4 stars.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|In my mind there is no other word for this film. It serves as a terrific homage to Vanishing point and at the same time has the humor that we have come to expect from a Tarantino film. You never know what is about to happen and at the same time you do. It has a stellar cast and plot and at the same time has the feel of the classic car films.
0440241413|5.0|I read this book a while back and I had never heard of the author, or even the book as a matter of fact..i was just walking around a bookstore and it caught my eye, and bought it because I though it could be really fun..    Well I was not disappointed, I absolutely loved it!! It was so much fun, I fell in love with the character, Becky is so much fun and I can certainly identify with her (in some aspects), mostly the way a lot of women will justify a purchase..it's hilarious!    So entertaining, romantic, fun, lighthearted, I couldn't stop reading it, it was my first Kinsella book and I am reading my 5th book from her (Shopaholic Ties the Knot).    I have already read Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, The Undomestic Goddess, Can You Keep a Secret? and of course Confessions of a Shopaholic..they were all sooo much fun, but it all started with Becky's 'Confessions..'    You HAVE to read it..I heard there will be a movie soon..enjoy!
B000LC55F2|2.0|Let me just say that I loved Memento.  Part of that movie's appeal is that they don't spoon feed you everything at the end but rather provide hints that leaves the viewer to try to unravel it's mysteries and inspires one to watch the movie multiple times to try to figure it out.  The Prestige is frustrating as it had the potential to provide the same experience, but instead everything is explained to you at the end.  The movie provided enough subtle hints to allow the viewer the fun of trying to solve the film on their own, while debating the possibilities with friends.  I felt robbed.  My suggestion to viewers is to turn off the movie with @ 5 minutes left and attempt to figure it out on your own....  Are you watching closely? - No need to do so if you watch the movie to it's disappointing finale...
B00001OH7P|5.0|It was 1972 and there had been nothing to prepare my young mind (then 20) for David Bowie and his Spiders From Mars band. What a different sound with the orchestra and the wild guitar wailing in the background on the first song Five Years to the almost cat-like background vocals on the infectious Soul Love. And then came the words from Bowie \\"I'm an aligator, I'm a momma poppa comin for you, I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock and rollin bitch for you\\"! Wow! Now he was getting really spacey. He sang with a very British accent and sang about some way out dude who was not all dude. The invented character of Ziggy became Bowie's alter ego for awhile as he represented the counter-culture movement that Mr. Bowie helped nurture and invent a new category of music which would soon be called \\"Glam Rock\\". This is still good rock music by any measure. Long live Ziggy Stardust and his Spiders from Mars! - Ciao

B00064WSNW|5.0|This is one of those albums that should be on the Desert Island list. King Crimson gets a new lineup with Adrian Belew on guitars and vocals, Tony Levin on bass, stick and backing vocals, Robert Fripp on guitar and Bill Bruford on drums. Apparently, this recipe of musicians was all that was needed to produce a disc full of great songs. Each number is strong enough to stand out on its own. I remember when it first came out and I heard it for the first time, I was overwelmed by how strange Adrian Belew's guitar sounded. I regret that I was not quite ready for such progressive sounds and it would be many years later before my ears grew up. This is a near perfect album, but it is definately not for everyone. You have got to have the ears for it. - Ciao
B000MR9D5E|5.0|with all the shows on tv which are basically the same these days(i.e. house md and other medical shows,the dozen csi's,and same-old reality tv)it's nice to have a show like this that was made from a standpoint other than making money off people who are blind to a well-done show.it would be amazing if shows such as these took over the commercialised ones so that people could be exposed to beauty instead of the continuous reminders of how hectic life is.
B00064WSN2|2.0|For my tastes, there isn't enough here to warrant many repeat listenings. I like King Crimson and prefer the later versions of this ever-changing alumnus to this mix of performers. I do like Pictures of a City very much and wish it had landed on the first album. For the people reading this who are unfamiliar with King Crimson, please invest in their first album In The Court of The Crimson King if you are looking for some vintage Crimson. I would skip everything after that until Lark's Tongue in Aspic when KC really found their true vibe through a solid new membership of talented players. This disc just doesn't do it for me. - Ciao
B000002U8G|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Pink Floyd First True era between the late '60s and the '70s are clearly defined by a more approached psychedia, in between this are the big first base The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, the later, same style A Saucerful Of Secrets, the more updated but still confusing Unmmagumma, and the most closely related to Atom Heart Mother, Meddle is an album which represents a new era in Pink Floyd's music, a more serious, commercial, modern and elegant one. While Meddle keeps some strong characteristics with Atom Heart Mother, the music displayed in Meddle is precisely light years from Atom Heart Mother Music, while a group of similarities can be easily detected, like the fact that Meddle, along with Atom Heart Mother and Wish You Were Here keep much of a very close structure. Still, despite their similarities, Meddle is much more cohersive and significant, while Atom Heart Mother is much of a frenetic display of musical talent but going nowhere and without being an accessible release, while Meddle approaches a lot more into a delightful comprehension, still cerebral but recognizable and appreciateable, and much more focused, it can be sayed that its their truly first album without a slight trace of frantic psychedelia or spaced out, freaked out movements toward its music, instead, is a much more laid back, accessible, solid but still undertaking album.<br /><br />Into the boundaries of its music, it possesses their first true firm base into a much more reflective, patient and much more melodic style, its still an underground, undertaking album with very few commercial treats, while its notorious their ambition grew higher on this release, only the more slightly famous, recognizable \\"One Of These Days\\" stands as their higher commercial success on the album, being a rythmical, easy instrumental piece with certain remarkable characteristics, mainly the introducing and fading wind in the song got to be pretty notorious, while also its echoing instrumentation. Trough a more sensitive and easy sound, they are present three fine compositions still with an undertaking style just as seen in Atom Heart Mother, these three capture a much more melodic and much lesser (or none) of a freaked out, once meaningful style, these are the sensitive, acoustic guitar penned, melodic \\"A Pillow Of Winds\\", which, oddly enough for Pink Floyd, deals with love themes, while the slow paced, soft and slightly mellow \\"Fearless\\" stands with one of their most memorable style, and the oddly joyful, uncompromising, light style of \\"San Tropez\\" stands as a highlight.<br /><br />At this point of their career, Meddle contains a music style where their compositions, both musically and in their lyrics was starting to really make sense, a cerebral and still awkward sense, but sense after all, and while most of the compositions in the album stand with a more laid back structure, these still are very powerful and reflective among the classic Pink Floyd's style. Although this album is a truly cohersive and accessible work, these facts are mildly throw away when the album gets to the song \\"Seamus\\" much more of an incoherent and misplaced composition but not dull at all, it keeps its sense as its only a 2 minutes song, if it would've been released in Atom Heart Mother I'm sure it would've been extended to 11 minutes or more, so this is their very slight and mild trace of a persistent psychedelia. Although the rest of its songs, all Meddle's material and main point is resumed in the huge, epic \\"Echoes\\", it went famous among Pink Floyd's releases as \\"Echoes\\" among with the Wish You Were Here' \\"Shine On You Crazy Diammond\\" are respectfuly placed as their most recognizable, epic and most important songs among their superb long compositions, Echoes possesses much more of a poetical scent with a dramatic perception, the 22 minutes long masterpiece is yet the more profound composition in the album, with its distractive lyrics, more simple but complex musical approaches with its instrumentation changes and unique performance, swifting through dramatic, melodic moments, through overwhelming guitar-penned moments, through characteristic musical movements, it stands as a bombastic, fierceful, undertaking but still accessible composition.<br /><br />Pink Floyd's compositions and more recognizable musical style is formed with a firm base on Meddle, still its successful variation of moods were truly comforting for the band, so their later approaches like Animals and The Dark Side Of The Moon keeps a more firm and confident structure, making Meddle another one of their most own influential releases.mentation changes and unique performance, swifting through dramatic, melodic moments, through overwhelming guitar-penned moments, through characteristic musical movements, it stands as a bombastic, fierceful, undertaking but still accessible composition.

B000002UA0|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Starting at later '60s, the later eternal band Pink Floyd releases their first album in August 1967, The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn. The band was first formed by frontman guitarist/lead vocalist Syd Barret (1946-2006), bassist Roger Waters (later leader), keyboardist Richard Wright, and drummer Nick Mason, and its their first (and only) album in which Syd Barret stands as the frontman, excepting for certain collaborations in A Saucerful Of Secrets. The album's characteristic psychodelia, spaced out style and its bombastic, experimental and freaked out, frantic moods saw Pink Floyd's best starts and their most influencial album in terms of their later psychodelic/progressive rock, and one of the most unique, '60s' style psychodelic rock, very influential among later bands, and with a special touch of space rock but with a meaningful torch that moves throughout each song, it marks their unique first base and stayed notorious in early psychodelic aspects differing from bands like Cream. The album's rock style is one of the few types of music which still wasn't a commercialized movement, as it was the '60s, Pink Floyd saw their best opportunity to get the best style from the era, and it wasn't a main psychodelic rock bands (as many psychodelic rock bands of the era splitted at the end of the '60s), although in this album it stands out as their best characteristic, they were more like a rock movement with a meaningful torch, as you may notice in their later albums, they moved into a more elegant, mature style but still keeping a great deal of their influences in their first experience with The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn. The album was well received in the U.K., although its production went a little bit shadowed as producer Norman Smith convinced the band for applying a more spaced out mood, trying to make their sound more pop, the atmospheric space sounds was the closer they got at the time for sounding \\"pop\\", and some of its songs went on being slight hits, but later recognized as certain important psychodelic movements, characterized by their unique ability to move swiftly from melodic, more comprehensible songs, through a frantic movement of experimental, instrumental pieces, and still keeping in some of its songs a very moody but significant, recognizeable pieces, songs like the surrealistic perspective in the poetic hit \\"Matilda Mother\\" may stand as the more commercial song in the album, keeping its potential in its vocal surprises, the distinctive space rock of the opening \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and the hugely experimental, frantic, freaked out, atmospheric, bombastic but serious instrumental piece \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" (be careful with this song, it caused me a headache) the three went out being as famous and characteristic songs in the album, they are nowadays recognized as true masterpieces. While later minor hits, the hypnotic, moody \\"Lucifer Sam\\", and the maniac \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk\\" stand both as some of my personal favourites. Moving throughout more commercial sounds and melodic sensitivity we can find the story telling, literal fantasia of \\"The Gnome\\", the later atmospheric beauty of \\"Chapter 24\\", which it also keeps its talent on its vocal surprises, the B-side, light style but firm \\"The Scarecrow\\", and the famous child-o-like but surprisingly significant, powerful and with a beautiful spaced out mood of \\"Bike\\", its such an original composition, it almost sounds like a humorous, parody song. While also previously released single by the band like \\"Arnold Layne\\" had also the characteristic style of The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn. Still, the album frenetic psychodelia and its undertaking, spaced out moods are not the image of later Pink Floyd's stands, while it rates more as a heavily influential, experimental album, it isn't the correct Pink Floyd image, the image of intelligence and elegance that they later possessed, so it isn't the best, but quite virtuos. I've never recognized Syd Barret as a musical genious, although he was certainly, before the drugs came in, a heavily influential, powerful and revolutionary musician, who's early inspirations gave to the later Pink Floyd a touch of multiple virtues, like to be more undertaking and non commercial, to have always an original and revolutionary style, and to always have an attractive and moody style, so, rest in peace, Syd Barret, your mission was accomplished.ret as a musical genious, although he was certainly, before the drugs came in, a heavily influential, powerful and revolutionary musician, who's early inspirations gave to the later Pink Floyd a touch of multiple virtues, like to be more undertaking and non commercial, to have always an original and revolutionary style, and to always have an attractive and moody style, so, rest in peace, Syd Barret, your mission was accomplished.

B00005JNX0|5.0|Here's another recently-made animated film that has two outstanding characteristics which make it a winner: 1 - consistently funny humor that adults can enjoy, and 2 - beautiful, bold colors.    When a movie is both fun to hear and to watch, I have very few complaints. This movie provides a lot of enjoyment with more jokes perhaps that adults would laugh at than the kids. I can't say that for sure, since I watched it by myself....but I sure got my share of laughs     The main thing is that all the characters, including supporting ones, are likable and funny in their own way. Every character is quite different. The story movies exceptionally fast so the hour-and-a-half is easy to watch.
0743298020|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  The characters are so well developed, the plot is beautifully done, and while I couldn't put it down, I also didn't want it to end.  The author's descriptions put the reader right in the middle of the story, we feel like we too are living in the homes described and we are a mouse or a cat (Shadow) watching the events.  Thank you to the author, and please treat us with another.
B00023B1LC|5.0|This is a solid suspense-spy film with an agent-on-the-run scenario. People who like a paranoid theme, where everyone is after you (I plead guilty) will love this.     The amount of violence in here was just about right, not too much and not too little. I also enjoyed the Paris scenery, both the street-level shots and the aerial photography. Ovrall, the cinematography is very good in this film. It's an involving story that once you're hooked, you stay that way. The two hours go by pretty quickly.     On the negative side, I get tired of American filmmakers trashing their own government all the time, in here its them trying to kill one of their own agents. I hear the third movie is really bad in that regard. I'm sorry to hear that as I liked the sequel (\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\") even better, although part of the reason was that I was now familiar with the main characters after watching this film. Anyway, I highly recommend the first two Bourne movies for fans of suspense, crime, intrigue, good locales, etc.

B00005JNS0|5.0|Wow, this was fantastic! As I was watching it, I asked myself, \\"Is this the best animated movie I've ever seen?' I think the answer is \\"yes,\\" at least at the time I viewed this.      After watching \\"The Polar Express\\" last year and seeing the most beautiful visuals and fabulous sound, I thought it might be awhile before anything topped that, but this movie beats it. That's because it's equally beautiful, color-wise, and more entertaining because of the excellent humor. The humor isn't just a bunch of funny lines; it's also funny sights on screen from the cars' \\"faces\\" to a lot of clever material in the background. There is so much to see that multiple viewings, I'm sure, would catch new things each time.     The characters are varied and the kind you care about, or want to find out more about, all of which translates into scenes which continually keep your interest.    The message is a nice one, too, and not delivered in any heavy-handed manner, either. Having a team to work with, people to be there to help and be helped, is better than going alone in life. Thy didn't beat us to death with it, but that is the unmistakable message in this story.    As a final note: don't turn this off when it's over; stay with the ending credits because there are some really funny comments, mostly by John Ratzenberger .
B000002I4S|5.0|GIANT STEPS was jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's second album, released in 1960. It is one of the most remarkable records I've ever heard, without a bum track in its original length. It succeeds on a number of levels.<br />The first is sheer virtuosity of the performers. Coltrane here was at the peak of his \\"sheets of sound\\" style, indefatigably playing 16th and 8th notes in fast tempos. Except \\"Naima\\", a ballad written for Coltrane's first wife, this rapid-fire playing is present throughout the album. The bassist Paul Chambers stays in the background for most of the album, but performs remarkable solos when given the chance. Ditto for Art Taylor, who gets a thrilling moment in the spotlight in \\"Mr P.C.\\" While the piano performances of the album are often called weak (Tommy Flanagan gives a famously unsure solo in the difficult \\"Giant Steps\\"), they never distract from the pleasure of the music as a whole.<br /><br />Secondly, GIANT STEPS displays remarkable musical ingenuity. \\"Giant Steps\\", the opening track, moves extremely quickly through chords, progressing over different keys. The improvisation that must be made over continues to challenge and stimulate jazz musicians to this day. \\"Countdown\\" is a reworking of the Miles Davis composition \\"Tune Up\\" that adapts its musical material to Coltrane's unique talents.<br /><br />Finally, the record is a masterpiece of production and sequencing. It sounds better than a lot of jazz albums from this era, with a strong sound across the whole range and no touch of static. The order of the tracks was also well thought-out, with \\"Giant Steps\\" a fine opening, the slow \\"Naima\\" positioned to give a break along the way, and \\"Mr P.C.\\" a splendid closer. But though the album as first released is flawless, I must take a slight exception with the extra material here, unreleased takes that disrupt this original flow and display nothing that would interest the simple home listener as opposed to the historian and completist.<br /><br />While records like Miles Davis' KIND OF BLUE (also featuring Coltrane and other musicians as on here) or Coltrane's later masterpiece A LOVE SUPREME are usual gateways into jazz, it was by listening to GIANT STEPS that I really got a handle on the genre. I'd recommend the album to any listener.ile records like Miles Davis' KIND OF BLUE (also featuring Coltrane and other musicians as on here) or Coltrane's later masterpiece A LOVE SUPREME are usual gateways into jazz, it was by listening to GIANT STEPS that I really got a handle on the genre.

B0000B1OGD|4.0|Ray Harryhausen adapted a Willis O'Brien story to create another magical fantasy. It goes without saying that the sfx are wonderful, the settings exotic and the final scenes frantic. The actors vary from the endearing Laurence Naismith & eohippus,the bland James Franciscus & Gila Golan, to the ridiculous Indian woman & the obligatory annoying kid. Sadly, Ray can control dinosaurs but not ham actors.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Boy, this was a beautifully-filmed movie, just gorgeous from first to last frame.  Almost as impressive was the story, a fantasy-mystery- romance-drama combination set in Vienna, Austria, around the turn of the 20th century.<br /><br />It is a story that should keep most viewers intrigued all the way and perhaps surprised quite a bit at the end. Edward Norton does his normal job of making you fascinated with whatever character he's playing, this time a magician with almost supernatural powers: \\"Herr Eisenheim.\\" The character he plays, and the tone of the movie in general, is pretty low-key with next to nothing in violence or profanity.<br /><br />It's simply a classy film and a modern-day one that older folks would very much enjoy as well as younger adults.

0790729407|4.0|Since few Americans know who the Irish Republican hero Michael Collins was, I guess it's pointless to go too far into the fact that now and again this film departed from reality for the sake of drama. Still, I enjoy Neil Jordan's movies and this was no exception. The man Michael Collins in the film of the same name comes off well here, far less of a terrorist than a freedom fighter turned statesman, basically the way he is regarded in Ireland to this day, and Eamon De Valera (just Google him and save time) is presented as a villain and a spiteful, petty man, willing to use his power to settle personal differences. Maybe that's true he did. In any event, this is a motion picture that barely made a ripple in America but was received by most of my family in Ireland with about the same surge of grateful joy that Braveheart got in Scotland. Its depiction of the violent Irish struggle for political autonomy was well told and frequently presented scenes of lasting impact. Collins' bravado, good humor, ingenious strategic savvy and ultimately his pragmatism in doing what needed to be done in his meetings with former enemies is all covered here, as is his treacherous murder at the hands of his own one-time comrades in the IRA. Had more of Ireland's people been as broad-minded as Michael Collins, the history of their island in the century just passed might have been far less tragic.
032147404X|5.0|_The Digital Photography Book_ is NOT the be-all end-all knows-all book of digital photography or even digital SLRs. But it is a really great book if you are like me and want to get one or two steps beyond \\"letting autofocus do its thing, pushing the button, and hoping for the best\\" but DON'T want to take a month-long course on how the f-stop mathematically relates to this or that and the difference between convex and concave lenses and so on and so on.<br /><br />I love taking pictures, but I am by no means an expert. Especially when it comes to SLRs and the thousand different settings you can make -- and potentially screw up. I just recently got my first digital SLR camera (a Pentax K10D) and was looking for a book to help me get beyond taking it out of the box, putting the lens on it, and taking a couple test shots of my parents' living room.<br /><br />I found that book in _The Digital Photography Book_ by Scott Kelby. It has a very nice easy-to-read conversational tone, and it doesn't get bogged down on technical detail. Yet, it had ENOUGH technical detail that I got a much better idea of how f-stops and focal lengths affect my pictures, and how that in turn is influenced by what type of lens I use.<br /><br />The book has details about lenses, f-stops, aperture speeds, macro shooting, landscape shooting, portraiture, some brief notes about sports shooting, recommendations about what camera setting work best in which picture settings, discussions of tripods and tripod mounting schemes, the uses of the monopod, and all kinds of other useful information.<br /><br />I can also say that _The Digital Photography Book_ has whetted my interest for more detail and made me a more adventurous photographer, so I probably WILL one day sit down for a month with a book about the more technical aspects of SLR and DSLR shooting. When I do, it will be in part because of Kelby's message that great pictures ARE achievable without a doctorate in lens and camera mechanics, you just need to get out and shoot and here's how. Thanks, Scott.<br /><br />I do feel obliged to add a couple of side notes: Scott focuses mainly on Canon and Nikon cameras, as they are the most popular DSLRs out there. Still, most of his information was also directly applicable to my Pentax, and likely to any other brand of DSLR as well. Also, the book does not have a whole lot of information on flashes and flash ratings and flash types.nd here's how. Thanks, Scott.

B0006ZE7G2|3.0|Looking back at Alan Parker's work, he was great for capturing the dark side of postwar England. You watch \\"Angelas Ashes\\" and \\"The Committments\\" and you can see the thread that leads back to \\"The Wall\\".     Supposedly there's a screentest that had Roger Waters audition for the role of Pink, but Boomtown Rat and Live Aid/Live 8 mastermind Sir Bob Geldof got the part. And he wasn't a Pink Floyd fan until years later.     But I think Parker made it a little too downbeat. There are things on the album that I think Roger comes across a little more over the top through it, and hopeful towards the end.     There is a story, but it's very nonlinear. You see the rock star's spiral into his own madness (similar to Syd Barrett) and what drove him there, but the theme of \\"The Wall\\" is a breakdown in communication and the walls we build around us, or built by others. You assume there's redemption at the end but it's really hard to tell.     Does the wife take up with the lover because Pink was sleeping with groupies to begin with? \\"Young Lust\\" should've captured Pink putting the band together a little more, out on the hunt for nubile maidens as the song suggests, instead of turning it into being about the groupies. By the time the groupie gets to Pink, his wall is already in place...bored and uninterested. The mother in the movie isn't all that menacing, neither is the wife until \\"The Trial\\". I thought this should've been ratcheted up a lot. The teacher however, is dead on. \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" is definitely one of the best parts.     The highlight of the film is \\"Comfortably Numb\\"... it's wonderfully filmed and is as creepy as anything Cronenberg's done.     Scarfe's animation had been used for the band's live shows and is used here, also a great highlight of the movie.     Big reason to have this is because it's in surround. The documentary's ok, and seeing the original \\"Another Brick in the Wall II\\" promo's cool.

0452282152|4.0|After watching the movie a couple of months ago, I decided to read the novel on which it was based.  I'm a big fan of visual arts and I couldn't wait to read it.  Tracy Chevalier's subjective descriptive style really kept my attention.  Elegant, clear, detailed... I could see, hear, feel and smell as Griet did.    The book is about Griet, a girl from a poor family in Delft, Netherlands, and the changes that take place in her.  After living all of her life with her family, she's sent to work as a maid in the house of a famous painter to help support her family.  At the same time she begins to realize (as others already had) that she's turning into a woman and struggles to deal with it.    At her new home, she has to learn how to deal with each of its inhabitants and still be herself.  She finds relief when assisting her master with ink and the paintings, even though it endangers her position in the house. I did like the end of the book, although its resolution felt rushed.    Chevalier's details on light and shadow and color and shape are delightful.    4.5 stars.
B0001I561E|5.0|I can think of three quick reasons why this has remained one of the best animated movies ever: 1 - Very good, very catchy songs that still sound good 15 years later; 2 - excellent, colorful visuals; 3 - the unique humor of Robin Williams, who seems to spout a joke-a- second. In fact, you have to pay close attention to hear Williams' lines because they come so fast and furious. Actually, at times they are too fast. You hardly have time to laugh or digest what he just said when another line hits you. Williams' genie character doesn't appear on screen until after the first third of the film is over.    Without all those jokes - and the great visuals that go with those gags (things popping up like Saturday morning cartoons), this would just be a routine Disney animated film. Part of the normal Disney fare includes a hero who is a good guy but a liar and a heroine who is the typical wasp-waisted beauty who is rebellious against the rules of the day.     Maybe the best attribute of this film is simply how fast it moves, meaning it's very, very entertaining.
B000055Y0X|1.0|I asked for a bunch of comedies from the 60s & somehow this war satire landed in the pile. At least it was't one of those lame 50's propoganda films & had a somewhat interesting twist; this time an introverted American biggot nutcase is the bad guy, with his own president against him at every step, & Russua is the innocent victim. I couldn't get through more than 1/2 of it.
B0000AOV85|5.0|First, the director of \\"Live At Pompeii\\" prob. had no idea at the time that he was filming one of the best selling albums of all time. The footage, filmed in the same studios The Beatles had recorded their classics just a few years prior, show Pink Floyd working (prob. aware of the cameras) on songs we now know by heart. The director had also said that what was in the movie was all he had.     Unfortunately, there is little concert footage filmed, there are bootlegs, but as far as a full length concert, it's either been lost in time (strange considering how multimedia focused they were), or you'll have to settle for \\"PULSE\\" and \\"In The Flesh\\" and somehow edit them together. Or still hope they do the one show together.     One thing Gilmour and Waters have been great about are doing interviews about Pink Floyd. Nick Mason and Rick Wright also contribute to the story of how this album came together. We learn that this was something they worked out on the road and that the actual studio time wasn't all that long, it was just a matter of PF getting studio time in.     We also get Alan Parsons explaining his part in putting the album together, by no means a small part. Add to that each of PF playing parts and dissecting the songs, and a demo of \\"Money\\".     The documentary is under 90 minutes, which is the right amount of length you need to cover the story behind making this album. AND there's bonus footage, so any fan of Dark Side of the Moon will want this. I've watched it more than once, so to me it warrants a purchase and not a rental.     I do hope one day for a \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" DVD because there's enough footage to do it.
B000FA57N0|1.0|Not having ever watched the TV series, I walked into this one with no preconceived notions.  As an HD DVD, the picture and sound was phenomenal.  But...I stopped watching about half way through it because it was boring.  There was a brief glimpse of action when River morphed into a Trinity-inspired kung-fu master (Matrix reference).  Other than that, I found this to be a Star Trek inspired knock-off.  My understanding is that the TV series was cancelled.  I now know why.

B00005B1W5|5.0|There is no concert I have watched more than this one since I first bought the VHS tape and then acquired the DVD when that came out. After many, many viewings of it, its still great stuff - especially that first 50 minutes.    The music is a little bit more diverse than on Yanni's first concert DVD: \\"At The Acropolis.\\" This concert features India's Taj Mahal and China's Forbidden City, In addition to the music, we have stunning color added;a great mix of purples, yellows, blues, pinks, etc. The concert stages - particularly in China - are bathed in these colors.    For most of my many, many viewings of this I would have the opening song, \\"Deliverance,\\" and the title tune, \\"Tribute,\\" are my two favorites.     Although many of Yanni's band members from the first concert were not with his group any longer by the time they did this one, they have been replaced by people are even more talented in many cases. It's hard to find a more talented musician that Pedro Eusteache, who plays a number of wind instruments and excels, of course, in all of them. I'm also in awe of new keyboard player Ming Freeman. These two are still in the orchestra today.    Violinist Karen Briggs is as animated and talented as ever and, along with Eustache, is the feature musician in the band. When the two of them alternate solos, playing off each other in \\"Renegade,\\" it's about as entertaining a few minutes as you'll ever find on an orchestral stage. I'm sorry Briggs is no longer with Yanni's band.    Ten years after first seeing and hearing this for the first time, I can still safely say music doesn't get much better than this, unless, perhaps, Yanni''s latest: Yanni Live!

But before he could do that, he stops and met an old man (King of Salem) who then told him to follow his heart (and dreams) - where he is to find treasure in the pyramids.<br /><br />Along the course of his journey, the boy meets with very intersting characters like gypsies, crystal shop merchant, the caravan & an Englishman, a desert woman - Fatima whom he later fell in love, and finally the alchemist.<br /><br />These characters played a part in bringing the boy closer to his dreams, and more importantly shaping the thoughts of the boy who began to 'live his dreams' and follow his heart.<br /><br />Written in a easy to read, and simple way, this book will inspire us to follow our dreams and gut feel. And the thoughts of the boy are well explained which are sometimes similar to our own thoughts - about others and oneself, gives a reflection on our lives as well.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Wall Street, 1989 film  The film begins by showing men at work at dawn, and other people going to work. It shows the escalator at the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Stockbrokers are cold calling people to get them to buy the stocks that are being pushed in a Bull market. The stock market matches buyers to sellers. Financier Gordon Gekko knows how to profit from bad news. Bud Fox, a seller of stock, explains himself to his father (who knows of an unannounced FAA ruling). Will Bud use this inside information to better himself? Is it legal?  Bud visits Gekko in a bid to move up in the world of high finance. Stocks are traded like baseball cards. Bud gets an order to buy a stock for Gekko. There are rewards for those who can pick winners in the stock market. Information is a valuable commodity, it can win battles. Bud shadows a British financier to learn what he is doing in NYC. This news causes Gekko to start buying shares in an Ohio steel company. Others also buy this stock, doubling its price. That night Bud visits the Gekko home. Sir Larry also visits Gekko to make an tender offer for Gekko's holdings. Gekko is also a shrewd investor in commodities like works of art. But takes a job with a maintenance company to allow him to snoop at other companies. [This is what the Watergate burglars did.] Bud's new found wealth allows him to pay back his debts, and then move to a new apartment in the East Side. He is also promoted for his increased sales; another salesman is let go because his didn't meet his quota. Life is sweet. Gekko's lawyer explains how Bud is to deposit money in an offshore bank in the Cayman Islands. There will be no traceable links to Gekko.  The \\"Stock Watch\\" group noted how Teldar was in play. Will Gekko buy it to split it up and sell off its parts? Is a company run to benefit its managers and workers or its owners? If ownership is widely distributed then management has a free hand to reward itself. What happens to an \\"over-funded pension fund\\"? [Does this explain the loss of pensions after the 1990s?] This film explains how new owners can profit by cutting wages for its workers and using this money to buy the company! Bud has a plan to save Bluestar Airlines; can it work? There is a dramatic scene between Bud and his father. Gekko has control of the shares, he can make more money quicker by breaking up Bluestar and selling off the pieces. [This allows bigger companies to eliminate competition and then raise their prices.] Gekko will also profit from looting the pension fund. The SEC is on their trail, they bring down the curtain on these financial looters. The dramatic ending is very ironic, Bud learned how to make a deal when it counts.  This story is loosely based on the \\"junk bonds\\" used to buy up and sell off businesses in the 1980s. Decreased Federal regulation allowed this. This film was completed before the October 1987 crash. You can learn how wealth is created when rich financiers know when to buy and sell. They buy under-valued assets and sell them at a higher price. Corporations with decadent management are their targets, like injured cattle for big cats in the wild. When 1% of the people own half the wealth in a country what is the end result? [This film shows the high-technology of the 1980s: personal computers, bulky wireless telephones, etc. Note the work place environment.] This could not have happened before the 1980s under the New Deal SEC laws.

B00005JPVN|4.0|The simplest comparison for \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is that it is a live action, R-rated Looney Toons show. In reality however, it is the ultimate guilty pleasure action film for extreme fans of the genre, and is closer to a Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner episode with plenty of blood and gore and absolutely nothing for kids. Wildly stylized characters, way over-the-top action, and umbilical cord surgery with a bullet, \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is explosive entertainment for only those who can stomach nonstop mindless action.<br /><br />Expert marksman and live-action Bugs Bunny Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) rescues an infant from a gang of mercenaries and becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving gun makers, senators, and maniacal hitman Hertz (Paul Giamatti). Recruiting sassy French prostitute Donna (Monica Bellucci) to care for the baby, Smith shoots his way to the top of the food chain in a wild fight to uncover those responsible for the devious plot.<br /><br />A proverbial Bugs Bunny, including literally mimicking the \\"wascally wabbit,\\" Clive Owen's Mr. Smith exudes cool; it's apparent that this is his shot at being James Bond (director Michael Davis always wanted to direct a Bond film) and he's thrown in every snappy one-liner and unflinching glare that he possibly can. Paul Giamatti is the show stealer as the crazed assassin Mr. Hertz, who is ruthlessly vile, wickedly intelligent, and an inept family man. His role is constantly surprising and spontaneous, and his batty bearded grins are laughably priceless. Monica Bellucci seems selected only for her willingness to do nude scenes and her sexy French accent. The remainder of the supporting cast are merely targets thrown in front of machine guns and heavy firepower to keep the downtime to a minimum. Even sex scenes are blanketed by violence, gunfire, and a bit of humor. While everything is markedly seedy and gritty, these antiheroes and villains fit perfectly into the underworld locales and environments (you wouldn't guess Bellucci was a prostitute based on the trailer).<br /><br />Some may consider Shoot `Em Up's weakest component to be its ridiculous story and the robotic debriefing of plot twists. But then they would have missed the point entirely. Davis' film mocks the overly simplistic and oftentimes nonsensical storylines of humdrum actioners and makes no excuses for its own deliberate transitions and set pieces that roll from one action sequence directly into another. Much like the clever ridicule of stereotypical horror films by Wes Craven's \\"Scream,\\" the characters in Shoot `Em Up are self aware of their positions in an action movie and work to make it as defiantly unexpected as possible. Clive Owen's Mr. Smith constantly spouts off his dislikes of the normalcies regularly witnessed in the genre, and the comforting blend of hyper-violence, twisted humor, and extreme exaggerations never stales throughout the relatively short running time. Nonstop action doesn't always make a movie, but it sure does help.<br /><br />So much action permeates every scene in Shoot `Em Up that to call it just an action movie would be an understatement. It's unrelenting action bravado of a particularly brutal temperament, masked by loads of dark humor (even the sex scene manages to have a vicious firefight halfway through). Shoot `Em Up proves that carrots can be deadly weapons, limerick usage makes better bad guys, and no matter the amount of killing done, it can be redeemed by saving the life of a babe (or two). And having a plot isn't always a requirement for making an entertaining action movie.<br /><br />- Joel & Mike Massiesed on the trailer).

B000ASDFJU|4.0|After two years of wanting this DVD set more than I wanted anything else, I finally have it.  And, after finally having it, I spent nearly 50 hours watching every single episode back to back to back.  I barely left my room, I barely talked to my friends, and I loved it.<br /><br />There are some definite drawbacks to the set, it's true.  However, unlike many here, I actually didn't have a problem with the packaging.  I admit that the height is a bit of a problem, because even though my shelves are extra-large, it doesn't fit in with the rest of my DVDs.  That's actually okay by me, because it just means that they'll get a place of honor all their own on another shelf.  And I don't mind that they're in cardboard slots in a binder.  It's good quality, stiff cardboard and there's no reason it won't last as long as you're taking care of your set.  The main issue I have with packaging is that the set comes in a plastic case that actually broke during transit, so that I no longer have anything to keep the dust off the velvet cover.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I'm not sending the whole set back just for a broken case that may well break again when they send me another one.<br /><br />The reason I bought this set is because of the television show, which I adore.  I never thought I could forget how great this show was, but apparently I did, because watching it all together like I did really made me see it with new eyes.  I found myself looking at it from a completely different perspective, especially now that I have two years of my own experience to add to it.  I was surprised, for instance, by how much I dislike Carrie Bradshaw now, as a character.  When I watched the show season by season, she just seemed like a fun, flawed character.  But once I saw how screwed up she really was as a person, most of my sympathy for her went right out the window.  Luckily, as the seasons went on, it became clearer and clearer that she wasn't the main reason to watch.  She didn't evolve or change as a character at all, but everyone around her did.  And maybe that was the point.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'll never know for sure if that was the point or not, due to the laziness in putting this \\"Collector's Giftset\\" together.  The extras compiled here are definitely the most pathetic extras I've ever seen.  There are some silly and poorly constructed games (The one where you choose which SATC man you're most compatible with doesn't even make any sense.  Play it and see.), some thoroughly pointless and badly edited clip packages and a bunch of other extras that might have been useful *IF* anyone had actually put some thought into them.<br /><br />For instance, there's a guide to all the men the women dated on each episode.  But they don't give the name of the actor, in case you want to look him up.  And when they tell you what disc to put in to watch that episode, they do it numerically: \\"Insert Disc 11\\", etc..  However, the discs aren't actually numbered that way, so you'd have to sit there and count every disc in order to figure out which one was the right one.  They DO give the names of all actors who play the main men, but that's nothing you can't easily find on IMDb, so that's a cop-out.<br /><br />Also, the discs themselves have been re-printed with new pictures on the outside, but they have the same exact layout and content as the discs from the individual seasons.  It's a cheap and lazy ploy, and it's outrageous that for $200, HBO couldn't be bothered to get the main actors, writers and producers into a studio to record some fresh commentary tracks.  I've already heard all these commentary tracks, so none of this is new.  It's outrageous, but it's not surprising.  HBO has a long history of gouging people for as much money as they can in exchange for as little content as they can get away with, so it's buyer beware, at all times.<br /><br />Yet, in spite of all this, I still think the show is amazing, and I'm still so thrilled to finally have it allat my fingertips that I'm willing to overlook just about anything.  After all, I didn't buy this for the extras.  And neither should anyone else.  If you already own every other season, throw out your cheap plastic packaging and invest in a nice CD wallet to hold your discs, but don't throw out all the discs just to buy this set.  It's not worth it.  (And if you only own a few seasons and are looking to this to complete your collection, you're better off just buying the ones you're missing on their own.  Trust me.)  However, if you don't own ANY of the discs, then by all means, invest.  I can't think of a better way to spend $200 and 47 hours.st about anything.  After all, I didn't buy this for the extras.

B00078JZ92|5.0|Like many great artists, Ray Davies was a slave to his muse in the late Sixties and this muse commanded him to follow his own heart and commercial rock music be damned! This particular obsession was the bucolic, ideal English countryside first introduced in verse in a late 1966 recording \\"Village Green\\", with its beautiful use of harpsichord and gentle though slightly melancholic melody. Almost two years later, in the late fall of 1968, Davies and the Kinks completed what is generally considered to be their magnum opus, 'The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society' and it was a flop. A collection of quaint, vaguely related songs which rhapsodize on the nostalgia of a simple time, 'Village Green' represented a major shift in fortunes for the band and it was also the end of an era of sorts as orignal bassist Peter Qualife left the band soon after the LP's release. Critics loved the record, especially in Britain, but the record buyers on both sides of the Atlantic couldn't care less! The album kicks off with the title track which is instantly memorable and ranks right up there with any of the Kinks finest. The song was one of the last recorded and served as a narrative overview of the major themes presented on vinyl. Wicked witches and phenominal cats, old friends and photo albums, steam trains and returning pop stars all help recreate an England which didn't really ever exist. This Castle release includes both the final 15 song LP in mono and the 12 song stereo version that was intended to be the orignal release but was pulled back by Pye at the request of the young producer whose first solo production chore this was. Ray Davies wasn't fully satisfied until close to the album's release as his obsessions with the themes presented still had not been hammered out to his full approval. It is amazing the response this LP has provoked almost forty years later and how it is still seen as the apex of the genius of Raymond Douglas Davies.

B000RJO578|4.0|Perhaps overreaching in its ambitions to be an action-flick parody, a cult ringer and a heartfelt britfilm, 'Hot Fuzz' is one thing for sure:  a good time.  'Shaun of the Dead''s Simon Pegg and Nick Frost return to form as mismatched police partners uncovering a complicated and ironically silly plot by 'Wicker Man'-style villagers to keep their tiny English town on the map.  The quick-edit techniques used to full effect in 'Shaun' get a little exhausting this time around, and the number of semi-obscure pop tunes thrown in can hardly be counted-- both probably a product of this outing's enhanced budget-- but it's the clever dialogue and characterizations that carry the day.  If more films could be crafted with the care and intelligence that this one has been, the world's I.Q. might gain a few points as the human race rediscovered its sense of humor.
0440178002|5.0|This is one of my favorite books (the same with movie based on the book). It has everything - action, adventure, interesting characters and medieval Japan in the background. The only flaw I find is that it doesn't describe how it REALLY was in the Japan in that time. Unfortunately the author created his own version of the reality, which is very close to the real thing, with some features changed and simplified to make it more readable for European and American readers. Still, it's worth reading.

B000ELJBAA|4.0|While most modern day Pink Floyd fans only know David Gilmour as a major contributor to their later popularity, he is indeed an amazing artist, musician in his own right.  This particular album was an interesting look into yet another facet of his talent.  It makes an excellent companion to the self-titled David Gilmour cd.
0345308239|4.0|Though written in 1984, this book takes apart governmental decision-making and reveals that since Biblical times right on through the Viet Nam War, government leaders frequently operated against the best interests of their nations. The \\"folly\\" is that these leaders knew they were on the wrongtrack but did little to correct their errors while they continued to defend them. Though the book deals extensively with the Viet Nam War (as well as the American Revolution and the Seige of Troy), the current fiasco in Iraq is very much on the mind of the reader. Almost every misstep by the British at the time of the American Revolution was replicated in some form during Viet Nam and it is clearly being repeated again in Iraq.
0920668372|5.0|My daughter handed this book to me and challenged me to read it without crying.  I thought I could do it.  After all, I had been warned, right?  I simply gathered all of my resolve and sat down with my granddaughter to read it to her.      It started out sweetly enough.  I was beginning to think this was going to be too easy, and I would be exposed as a non-sentimental cold-hearted granny.  It involved a FATHER telling his child about a mother, so this couldn't get too tender, right?  Wrong.    Without telling you how it ends, let me just say that by the time I reached the last few pages, I was unable to actually speak the words.  My granddaughter (age 3) thought it a bit odd, but tolerated me as I tried to regroup and dry my eyes so that I could at least SEE the words.  I looked to see whether my daughter was laughing at me, but she was in worse shape than I was!    It is the sweetest, most tender story I have read in a long time -- maybe EVER.  Not sappy-sweet, but insightful and true.  I predict that you will read it once, then struggle to read it over and over to your little one(s), because they need to hear it.  At this point, it's just a cute story to them, but as they grow, they will understand what you could never explain to them:  that you love them now and forever and ever, more than they can imagine.    Excuse me while I get another tissue...
B000AP04OM|5.0|I just bought this version and haven't had time to play all of the special features, but there seems to be a lot of commentaries and less behind the scene videos. I would love to see the deleted scenes or video of the actors while filming this movie, but I think it's too much to ask since this movie was made in the mid 60's. They did a great job in restoring it though. The quality of the picture is very good, almost as if it was recently made, which led me to discovery of why all actresses back then looked so beautiful and their faces looked perfectly smooth and wrinkle-free... LOL.    However, I think this is by far the cheesiest, corniest yet funny and romantic movie I have ever seen.  The funniest scenes are when the Captain blew his whistle to summon his children and when Maria blew her whistle to ask for Captain's own signal. The look on his face was priceless.  The most romantic scene is the Laendler scene, where their relationship started to bloom.  The cheesiest and corniest scene is the gazebo scene between Maria and the Captain. Somehow, I don't see any chemistry between them. Maybe it's the way the Captain touched Maria or his exaggerated voice when asking for Maria's relative to ask permission, I'm not sure. To me the Laendler scene is more convincing in showing their blooming romance.  The most unforgettable songs are Edelweiss and Do re mi (even my 2yo loves these songs and can sing to them).    Overall, I love this movie, especially the handsome Captain, played effectively by Chris Plummer. I think he should be nominated for Academy Award instead of Peggy Wood who played Reverend Mother... But this is different story.    I feel kind of sorry for the Baroness, since she's not a real villain, but someone who traveled all the way to Salzburg to get acquainted with her beau's children only to be intercepted by their governess/charmer. However I don't disapprove of Maria and Georg's romance, since that's the plot... LOL. Eleanor Parker was convincing in her role as Baroness.    Julie Andrews was also effective in playing a cheerful, innocent and outspoken governess with a gifted voice. It was a little bit disappointing when after the wedding, she suddenly played a role of a doting but reserved and obedient wife.    As for the dubbing issue and the apathy from Chris Plummer... I don't really care. They shouldn't have dubbed his singing since it was fine... Although it was a bit shaky, it sounded sincere and more realistic coming from someone who hadn't sung in years. Perhaps, this (and the fact that he was somewhat limited to similar roles as Captain von Trapp after this movie) is why he dislikes this movie so much up to this day.
B000002U8G|5.0|As a complete fan of all incarnations of Pink Floyd, which definitely begins with the beginning and Syd Barrett, if I were forced to pick a favorite, not that I really could pick just one. . . this album probably would be first on my list . . .

I'd recommend it for younger children as well.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Now, here's something you don't see every day. Waking Life is a movie that isn't afraid to be smart, but it manages to be sexy at the same time. And the painstakingly crafted visuals are guaranteed to keep you watching long enough to - gasp! - actually have an original thought or two by the time you're all done.    Imagine you're dreaming, and you know you're dreaming, but you can't seem to wake up. What would you do? In the world of Waking Life, you'd free your mind, that's what. The twenty or so teachers you'll encounter here each have a unique message to share. You'll meditate on death, contemplate the future of human evolution, and reject your plateau. And if you do get around to waking up, things may never be the same.    If you're into movies where the person who changes the most at the end is you and not the protagonist, you won't wanna miss Waking Life.    It's a series of holy moments, if you're looking closely.

The story is well done, but it does contain violence, however, it is just so different than anything I have ever seen before.  I highly recommend both.
0151012768|3.0|I got used to the story being in the form of letters, e-mails, interviews and diary entries and it seemed to get easier to read as the story moved along. However there were sections I skim read that I found plain boring.<br /><br />Although I could see the political satire in the story I would have to question the description that it's a `...feelgood comedy...' as suggested on the back cover.<br /><br />The intelligent conversation and observation came mainly from Sheikh Muhammad who was a likable and respected figure. I liked his observations on the class snobbery in Britain...maybe that WAS the comedy ;)<br /><br />When we first meet Dr Jones (Fred) he has `...moved on from religion...' and gives talks on 'Why God cannot exist'. As the story develops he learns about faith from both the Sheikh and the Yemen project. However, although I appreciated his personal journey, I never got to really like him, I just felt sorry for him.<br /><br />All in all it was 'okay'. A little dull, but readable.<br />Thankfully though, there are plenty more books on the shelf ;)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's not so much that there is anything highly original in concept about this series.  Gene Roddenberry pitched \\"Star Trek\\" as Wagon Train to the Stars.  I think he would have recognized and enjoyed \\"Firefly.\\"<br /><br />What makes \\"Firefly\\" a standout, in my humble opinion, is a combination of factors.<br /><br />In the first place, the ensemble cast is nothing short of superb.  In fact, I'm a little annoyed with Mr. Whedon for killing off Wash and the Preacher in the \\"Serenity\\" full-length film.  However, here in the series, you can enjoy the whole bunch, each of whom contributes largely and directly to the success of this series.<br /><br />Second, the writing is really good.  You hear a lot about good writing, often in relation to indifferent work like \\"The Sopranos.\\"  In this case, the accolade is deserved.  The writers give us some wit and some serious interaction along with each story.  You don't get that paint by the numbers feeling often, if at all.<br /><br />Third, the production values are top.  Remember, Roddenberry fussed over the design of the Enterprise, even though the network suits told him, \\"Take a cigar shape, put some windows on it, end of case.\\"  The Serenity looks real, both inside and out.  The crew accepts and appreciates their ship (mechanic Kaylee maybe edging into Scotty-like obsession), but is always realistic about its shortcomings.<br /><br />OK, some hardcore hard-science fans may find aspects simplistic.  \\"Star Trek\\" stuck to 'Class M planets.'  In the \\"Firefly\\" universe, the habitable worlds have been terraformed.  So what?<br /><br />And as far as not having aliens, (a) see 'terraformed' above, and (b) the homicidal Reavers are alien enough.<br /><br />Like \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Firefly\\" the series was pushed off stage by a neglectful network that didn't recognize quality when they had it.  Like \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Firefly\\"'s fans pushed hard enough to get a full-length motion picture.  I'm one of the ones who saw the \\"Serenity\\" movie first, and then backtracked to \\"Firefly.\\"<br /><br />\\"Firefly - The Complete Series\\" has got to be one of the best values in DVD that I've ever found.te Series\\" has got to be one of the best values in DVD that I've ever found.
B000VNMMRA|4.0|After having a vicious assault be temporarily staved off , Justin Long's character shakily asks his savior if he's done stuff like that before - and if he's killed someone before - to which John McClane's laconic response is \\"Not for a long time.\\" And, indeed, it's been 12 long years since [[ASIN:B000O78KW4 Die Hard with a Vengeance (Widescreen Edition)]]. John McClane is now older, balder, grumpier, and, being saddled with a PG-13 rating, not as profane, but he still cannot stay out of trouble. This time he's assigned the seemingly mundane task of escorting in young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), who's wanted for questioning. But the situation quickly sours as, within moments of meeting Farrell, McClane begins to hear that oh-so-familiar melody of automatic gunfire directed at their noggins.<br /><br />Both McClane and the frail but side-of-the-mouth funny computer geek speedily realize that Farrell's fringe involvement is merely the very tip of the iceberg, and that the stakes are much, much higher. Turns out that the contractor who'd hired Farrell to do a simple, innocuous code work is scheming to hold the entire nation hostage with his own paralyzing brand of cyber terrorism. Soon, the systematical shutdown of the American infrastructure is underway as, basically, all things computerized become compromised. This includes the targeting and usurping of key establishments such as the FAA, Amtrak, the stock market, and our satellite communications system. But, for Los Angelinos like myself, the most insidious act committed may have been the subversing of *gasp* the street traffic lights.<br /><br />For the now grizzled John McClane, nothing much has changed. He's a Lieutenant Detective now, so he's kind of moved up in the world. And he still has those perpetually pursed lips. But his personal life is predictably very much in shambles. He's alone again, divorced (with his ex-wife Holly gone back to using her Gennero surname) and estranged from his children. The start of the film has McClane pathetically attempting to keep tabs on his sullen and willful daughter, Lucy Gennero (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she wants none of his reconciliatory gestures. Not to mention, McClane's an anachronistic type who clings to classic rock music and who is computer unsavvy. Good thing he's got a hacker in his custody.<br /><br />It's such a treat to watch Bruce Willis again be in his element and playing this iconic role. Not that Entertainment Weekly has the final say, but I do agree with the magazine's listed assessment of [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard (Widescreen Edition)]] as being the top action film ever ([[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] was number 2, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was number 3). Nowadays, Willis, at 52 years old, is not as spry or free with the smirks. But his physicality, even at this stage, can't be questioned as he suffered bruises and scars in the making of this film. As McClane, he still trounces bad guys with the best of 'em. But, more so than McClane's penchant for arse whoopin', what draws the audience to him is that aura of reluctance, world weariness, and doggedness which he exudes so naturally. We relate to this ordinary, blue collar cat who, time and again, becomes stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time and is forced to angrily muddle thru because there's no one else to do the job. Although LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD portrays McClane as more of a supercop this time, who can go one on one with an F-35 fighter jet and murder an assault chopper with a car, I still fondly remember the first film, in which McClane passed muster as a very likable everyday guy barely keeping it together in Nakatomi Plaza. John McClane has built up so much good will that I'm able to easily forgive - and even celebrate - the high octane and wildly improbable excesses here.<br /><br />Justin Long, dubiously best known as the Mac guy in the Apple computer ad campaigns, gets his number called for sidekick duties, and he does a good job, although there were times where his trembly act got to be too much. His Matt Farrell may be a borderline computer felon but his heart's in the right place. Long gets to make the brunt of the wisecracks while McClane tersely motors along (he says to some fellow geeks who'd just blown his cover, \\"Good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.\\"). One failing of the film is the lack of a charismatic villain. Timothy Olyphant is unmemorable as former Homeland Security computer whiz Thomas Gabriel, whose mission is to digitally teach the nation and his ex-bosses a lesson while garnering sinful financial amounts. There's nothing fresh or arresting about Olyphant's acting performance, which basically consists of a whole lot of staring really hard. But, admittedly, it's fun to witness Gabriel's ever growing exasperation as McClane persists in surviving. Maggie Q does better as the evil hot Asian babe who's also a formidable martial artist. Her character Mai proves to be pretty resilient (but, ultimately, not resilient enough). Writer and maverick director Kevin Smith gets a chance to mug for the camera as the Warlock (or Freddy, to his mom), a jedi hacker whose base of operations is in his mother's basement. Bonnie Bedelia, by the way, is sorely missed, and the film would've benefited with more scenes between McClain and his surly daughter.<br /><br />LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD was primed to be a colossal summer blockbuster, and, as such, it had certain criteria it had to meet. Director Len Wiseman (the UNDERWORLD films) comes strong and full bore with great visuals, a relentless pace, implausible action sequences, and crazy pyrotechnics. And all this performed at raucous, senses shattering decibels. The stunts are mindblowing, keeping in mind that CG effects were kept to a minimum. These are flesh and bone stunts being done here. But, still, at the heart of the loud thrill-a-minutes, there is Bruce Willis keeping it all together with his signature McClane-isms. I still get a vast kick out of his un-PC chortling whenever he causes yet another bad guy's demise (oh, that poor, agile-as-a-monkey French dude). As always, to me, his mockery of death, in a way, adds a layer of realism as this has become McClane's way of ackowledging his vulnerability and celebrating his surviving yet another harrowing scrape. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is PG-13, but the film finds ways to circumvent the rating as the ever resourceful McClane continues to cuss (but minus the \\"F\\" word) and ad-lib his way to amassing an impressive body count.

0743298020|1.0|Because books like this are what I always seem to end up with - psychotic characters and disturbing plot lines that make me feel like scrubbing myself clean afterward.  This book seemed promising at the beginning, but quickly descended into the type of scandalous trash that you'd expect to see on one of those horrible TV talk shows.  At least you can turn off the TV - and put down the book.  Which is exactly what I did.  At least I know not to give Diane Setterfield one more minute of my valuable time.
B000QXDED6|1.0|First of all, I tried to keep an open mind about this movie, despite the fact I don't care for these old fashion sort of battles, the spears, all the blood. Maybe that's it, the movies show too much blood, getting stabbed, etc. I was a little surprised this wasn't too bad compared to something like Braveheart (in terms of blood and how gory it is; but then again, it's been awhile since I saw Braveheart, so maybe I'm wrong).  But, where is the story? Where is the character development? I understand, fight to no longer be slaves, but still, there must be more. And who are these people? A queen, a king, some god, and a lot of people who fight. There was so little character development. I finally knew who one person was just because he's the one with some cloth wrapped around his eye.  And the blood/CGI, ugh. Not good. Too fake and pointless. Maybe that's why it seemed easier to sit through this than Braveheart.  And the battles? I've seen commercials last longer than that. Now I am no big action sort of guy in films, but it's nice at times, and this was just flat out horrible.  The ending was short too. I like why he did what he did (won't say much, don't want to spoil it), but that was about it.  And this nude sex bit. It really isn't that bad. Personally, I don't quite understand why this country is so touchy about sex and nudity, as if it's bad to make love to your spouse, but it's OKAY to stab someone through their heart, and decapitate them. \\"I know honey, you prefer us to beat each other up and have our own blood bath, and I know it's worse to ask this, but can we have sex? I know it's worse! It's horrible, so shameful! but please?\\" 'rolls eyes' But that's beside the point.  The point here, the movie was done poorly.  The story wasn't strong enough, you didn't know the people too well (guess that's no longer important in films), the blood/CGI was weak, battle scenes ended so quickly. Reminded me of the movie Doom. Through all those battles, and no blood stains onthe warriors, yeah that makes sense. I go to work, fairly clean place, and yet I come home from the factory with dust, yet all these people fight and no blood.  Oh well, that's not important, right? Who cares. just sit down and watch some movie that shows breasts, sex, violence and blood.  I was expecting more than what I got here. Grab the 'History Channel' special on the 300. I'm sure it's better than this.

1594489505|3.0|This was sort of a Gone with the Wind for Afghanistan, only not as good.  The writing is pedestrian, and the characters caricatures.  I skipped whole sets of paragraphs and even a page now and then, as it was obvious what was coming.  It seems that nowadays all an author has to do to be taken seriously -- at least by some -- is to throw a lot of pain and brutality into his work -- as in the equally overrated Water for Elephants. Also make the story feature a woman or two, for the chick-lit market. It's OK as long as there is a happy, possibly even fairy-tale-ish ending. In this case it was clear that the author was using the violence the way some use sex, to sell the reader on compassion for   Afghanistan.    That said, although I felt as if I'd been given an easy-swallow version of the past thirty years of Afghan history, it is true that I need to know more abut Afghanistan. So now I do.  And naturally I deplore all the violence that has been done there -- this poor country has been a sink-hole of violence for ages.  The men abuse the women, the religious abuse those of different opinion, and invading countries do their worst.    Sad story, poorly told.

B000JVT1U0|4.0|I have not seen the remake of *The Wicker Man*, starring Nocholas Cage.  Having seen (and owning) this film, the original version, my question is, \\"Why would Hollywood do a remake?\\"  This version of *The Wicker Man* is a thriller, and it keeps the viewer's attention all the way through to the surprise ending.  The acting is excellent, the story well written, the directing and cinematography first-rate.  Having said all this, this film might not appeal to today's general audience.  (Hence, the remake?) It's a British film, it's somewhat dated, and it has no special effects.  It's still one heck of a film, though, for those who enjoy a good thriller or horror flick.

033041836X|3.0|When Imre Kertesz writes about Auschwitz, he does so in a way of mid-european intellectual, who knows his history, his philosophical predecessors, his native background and all that may be connected to it in some way. Kertesz survived notorious concentration camp, so none can say that he hasn't been there, and that he doesn't know what he's talking about.<br /><br />When Alice Sebold writes about her raping, she does so in a journalistic manner. Almost transcribing line by line from official papers events that transpired in distant past. While doing this, she moves farther and farther from her experience, and text becomes monotonous and shallow speech about how horrible raping really is.<br /><br />But, there really is no answer present in this book why raping is so horrible. Of course, to some this question may seem to be futile cause answer somehow imposes itself. Yet again, Sebold is a writer, and by definition writer should be able to tell her experience in a somewhat different manner than almost judicial speech. Of course, we are here for experience of reading, for answer to almost pervert question: \\"How does it feel to be raped?\\" And yet, we do not find it.<br /><br />There are really brilliant passages about society lack of care for victims, and the need to \\"be normal again\\", but majority of the book is written in a way that pushes you back from the start. This changes by the end of the book, where Alice suddenly starts to be more personal, and more close that before. It almost feel as she is being more honest with herself. But few pages in the last chapter cannot save badly written piece of journalism (this can hardly be called autobiography, or a novel).<br /><br />This book is easy enough to follow and it lulls you in a certain state of mind. If we presuppose the fact that raping is something awful (about which there never is any talk in the book) than what we can see and read  in the book is a behavior of a insulted eleven-year old girl, and not of a  older, intellectually more capable female writer. One should expect more from Sebold.female writer. One should expect more from Sebold.

B00005JMUA|5.0|Quentin Tarantino completes his epic tale with this worthy sequel.  The Bride finally gets to Bill and her revenge is ready to be had.  There's plenty to love about this movie.  It's got action, a good story, and all the things that make a Tarantino movie, a Tarantino movie.    It's definitely worth your time.    Highly recommended.
1400032717|4.0|Narrated solely by an autistic teenage boy, the book takes us through his perceptions of his surroundings, from his daily school activities, neighbors and parents' divorce. The plot itself isn't groundbreaking, but the delivery of it is interesting and absorbing; you really get the feel that he is talking to you directly. I would recommend this book for its unique story telling effects. It was a quick and very entertaining book to read on a train ride.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against the Machine's The Battle of Los Angeles is my favorite Rage CD.  It's perfect, from the opening chord of Testify to the last sound War Within A Breath.  I can't recommend this CD highly enough.  The political lyrics are in top notch form and everyone is in a groove with the musci making.  Superb.    My favorites: Testify, Guerilla Radio, Calm Like A Bomb, Mic Check, Sleep Now In the Fire, Born of a Broken Man, Maria, Voice of the Voiceless, New Millenium Homes, War Within a Breath.  That's only TWO songs not mentioned.  This is definitely one of my favorites and one of the best of all time.    Must Have.

B000V1Z8KK|3.0|Well at first the premise of the movie didn't really interest me. I thought it looked like your typical Army movie with just a lot of blood shed and a boring plot. In actuality it is Bourne Ultimatum starring Mark Walhberg instead of Matt Damon. Government conspiracies abound and they all relate back to \\"guy works for government and guy gets set up\\" and that is what this is. A former army shooter who is contracted to teach the FBI how to kill the president so they can stop it, when in reality they are framing him. Luckily he has one FBI agent who believes him and the two of them team up to take on the U.S. government together. Decent flick, something to do for .99 cents.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV (Or [b]ZOSO, Runes, Untitled, Four Symbols, and The Fourth Album[/b]) is a masterpiece whatever you call it.  The pure energy behind the release is phenomenal.

B000I62JAK|4.0|This movie is 6 years old and I'm just watching it now. I never really had much interest in seeing it b/c I didn't think that it looked very funny.... Well I have rented sooooo many Amazon unbox videos that I had run out of options so I decided to take the plunge and rent it. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. It definately was much funnier than I thought and I had a few good laughs. The costumes and hair are hilarious and Vince Vaughn as Zoolander's coal mining brother who didn't say a work cracked me up. There is a great many \\"cameos\\" that make the movie worthwhile and even has Paris Hilton in it 2 years before she bacame famous. Will Farrell does an expected funny job as does Owen Wilson. I'd recommend it for when you are sitting home alone or with a buddy w/nothing to do on a weeknight. It isn't \\"American Pie\\" or \\"Blades of Glory\\" funny but it is definately worth renting.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin is one of the most enduring bands of the 20th Century.  They are the epitome of hard rock.  After having their presence felt with their superb debut [[ASIN:B000002J01 Led Zeppelin 1]] they decided to come back even harder.  Led Zeppelin is what all sophomore releases and sequels aim to be...even better than the first one.    Whole Lotta Love 5/5  What Is and What Should Never Be 5/5  The Lemon Song 5/5  Thank You 5/5  Heartbreaker 5/5  Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman) 4.5/5  Ramble On 5/5  Moby Dick 4.5/5  Bring It On Home 5/5    Definite Must Have
B000R8YC18|5.0|Travis Bickle - the \\"Taxi Driver\\" in the film - is not so much a psychopath but someone who is mentally ill. He struggles to relate and connect with other people, slowly becomes detached from reality, indulges in inappropriate behaviour, and has a naive sense of what is right and wrong.<br /><br />The loneliness and disconnection of Bickle has echoes in the character of Holden Caulfield in \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" who likewise drifts around New York City searching for some kind of meaning.<br /><br />The ending always seemed a little strange until one accepts it as a fantasy of Bickles deranged mind.<br /><br />\\"Taxi Driver\\" remains a powerful and disturbing film even after all these years despite far more graphic films because the characters are so believable.<br /><br />A great film from the great Martin Scorsese.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's follow up to the successful [[ASIN:B0000508U6 Parachutes]] is this album.  Although skeptical at first, this album really grows on you.  It's wonderful.  Coldplay put out a grand album with this one.    My favorite tracks are: In My Place, God Put a Smile Upon Your Face, The Scientist, Clocks, Daylight, Warning Sign, Amsterdam.    Highly recommended.
0740748475|5.0|Ok, so I bought this as a Christmas present for my Dad and then sat down and read it all myself (do you think he'll mind?).  I have loved Calvin and Hobbes for years and the complete series is superb.  I just wish we had snow so I could model snowmen like Calvin.  He is my hero.  And who hasn't wished they had a friend like Hobbes?  Well, ok but without the full body contact rumble that is his welcome home. I think the boxed set is great and the final comic brought a tear to my eye.  What a wonderful view of the world with all its complexities, nuances and humour. And what a shame there are no more...
B000IHY9UW|4.0|The Doors is one of music's most enduring rock groups, led by one of the 20th century's most interesting personalities Jim Morrison.  The movie, directed by Oliver Stone, is not a biopic, more of an \\"homage\\" to the life, and the character of Jim Morrison.    The movie details his life, and his rise and fall in music, culminating in his death at 27.    The DVD features the same features from the earlier Special Edition, including Oliver Stone's commentary.  Included are 43 minutes or so of deleted scenes and a couple new featurettes.    Highly recommended.
B00005JPVN|4.0|Rarely has a title so accurately described the movie it represents. \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is a no-holds-barred, over the top, action-packed roller coaster ride with a sick, depraved sense of humor. And yes, I enjoyed every second of it; here's a film so aware of its tastelessness that it piles it on thick, with stylish, excessive violence and one-liners so hokey that they succeed in being incredibly funny. It's a good thing it refuses to take itself seriously; only a tongue in cheek movie could feature a baby's birth in the midst of a shootout. You would never expect something like that to be fun, but it certainly is in the case of \\"Shoot `Em Up.\\" Of all the mindless action films of recent memory, this one is by far the most original, the most engaging, and definitely the most entertaining.    The main character is a man known only as Mr. Smith (Clive Owen), a gun-toting tough guy who likes carrots and hates drivers that don't use turn signals. He opens the film with a shootout scene that's anything but formulaic--he tries to save a pregnant woman from an army of well-armed bad guys. Leading them is the ruthless Hertz (Paul Giamatti), who wants to get home for his son's birthday party. While Smith doesn't know who the woman is or why Hertz wants her dead, he willingly intervenes on her behalf, shooting whoever tries to get near her. He also delivers her baby with the speed and accuracy of a professional sharpshooter, even using his gun to shoot off the umbilical cord.    The baby is safe, thank goodness. Unfortunately, Smith is too late to save its mother, who quickly takes a bullet to the brain. Now stuck with a newborn, and now on Hertz's short list of business to be taken care of, Smith finds himself drawn into an elaborate web of political and medical corruption. To make sure the baby is cared for, he seeks the help of Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci), an Italian prostitute specializing in clients with a lactation fetish. She's initially unwilling to have anything to do with Smith or the baby. But she lowers her defenses as the film progresses, albeit reluctantly. The baby--who she names Oliver--reminds her of a painful past event she's been trying to forget. And Smith ... well, he's just Smith: a cold, spiteful, wisecracking gun enthusiast.    Hertz, meanwhile, is desperately trying to find the baby. But why? Does it really matter? If it allows for scene after scene of fun-filled, high-energy shootouts, I should think not. This movie plays like an extended stunt montage, with every jump, kick, jab, punch, and slam made overtly unrealistic for maximum enjoyment. Characters shoot at each other as if being paid by the bullet. Wound-ridden bodies litter the floor. This movie's violence is so brutally overplayed that I couldn't help but laugh, which I'm sure was the intended effect. I also laughed quite a bit at Smith's jokiness as well as his unique views on protecting a newborn baby; there's a moment when he explains the intricacies of a gun to Oliver, from where to load it to how to hold it to when to shoot it. It should come as no surprise that the baby actually smiles at this.    Does this sound like the conventional material of an action film? If it were possible to pinpoint what makes this movie work so well, every filmmaker would be relying on it. The genre has nothing to do with it--action films are about as common as they get. It certainly isn't because it's wholesome, pure, or even necessary--this is escapism at its most extreme. Maybe it has something to do with revitalizing the action film, presenting a clever, original story that not only laughs at its own outrageousness, but flaunts it, as well. With the exception of its length (a brisk ninety minutes), everything about \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is big, from the stunts to the sense of humor to the completely preposterous story. And that's exactly the way it should be; nothing this intense could ever be told on a small scale.    There's a scene late in the film that pits Smith against Hertz while on a flight: \\"Guns don't kill people,\\" Hertz says, \\"but they sure do help.\\" Had this been any other movie, such a line might have been questionable, maybe even offensive. But for a film like \\"Shoot `Em Up,\\" it fits right in. Pretty much everything about this movie fits, despite being untamed, improper, and just plain excessive. But that's what makes it so much fun; the further it went, the more I enjoyed myself, and the more I enjoyed myself, the further it went. This movie doesn't know the meaning of restraint, and that above all else made it great. Only one thing that could have made it better: a body count at the bottom corner of the screen. Now that would have been funny.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine's debut album kicks heavy.  It's got a good sense for lyrics and they're aimed somewhere they should be.  Rage gets written off as an anti-goverment band but I see them differently.  They're anti-control.  They want the proper democracy just as much as everyone else.  This is a great CD.  Higly recommended.    My favortie tracks are: Bombtrack, Killing in the Name Of, Bullet in the Head and Wake Up, but all the tracks are excellent.    Highly recommended.    Also check out  [[ASIN:B0000029D9 Evil Empire]]  [[ASIN:B00002MZ2C The Battle of Los Angeles]]  [[ASIN:B000053EZW Renegades]]
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Not much more I can say about this movie that already hasn't been said.  Incredible cast, great effects, rich characters, smart dialogue, and just a rip-roarin space adventure.
055358202X|4.0|I wasnt sure about this series in the first couple of books, however now the story has me captive.  I would give it 5 stars but as with all previous books in this series I find the \\"gazillion\\" characters a bit overwhelming at times.  Also there are some chapters that I think, \\"really, we had to write about that?\\"      Otherwise, the story flows beautifully. I took it on a week long vacation and couldn't put it down.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This was my first Pet Shop Boys album and I'm so glad I got it. I tend towrd bands like Erasure, New Order and this fit right in. Highly recomended if you like the 80's euro-pop-new-wave thing.
B000O77RLE|5.0|Outstanding movie presented in full HD glory, does it get any better than this?  Eastwood's treatment of a very sensitive topic (depicting a horrific battle from the other sides perspective) is as good as I have ever seen.  Acting is top notch (particularly Wantanabee) as is the cinematography and sound.  For anyone interested in WWII, you can't miss this movie!
B000NA77YO|5.0|This CD compliation is way overdue.TheRonnie James Dio era of Black Sabbath is, in my humble opinion, the very best of Sabbath. If you are a fan of that era this CD is for you. From the beginning it rocks with the Sabbath classic \\"Neon Knights\\", a truly legendary heavy metal song. We are also treated to such classics as \\"Lady Evil\\", \\"Heaven and Hell\\", \\"Die Young\\" and a favorite of mine \\"Lonely is the Word\\". Next we move into the Mob Rules tracks.\\"Mob Rules\\" comes blaring out as the first track from that album. A true heavy metal classic. \\"Turn up the Night\\" is next. This song is an underrated, yet blistering tune, worthy of this CD.\\"Voodoo\\",and \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" round out the Mob Rules portion. My only complaint is that \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" was left off, which I believe is one of their greatest songs of all time.    We then turn to the \\"Dehumanizer\\" era. Dehumanizer, to me, was one of their heavest and most powerful albums. I really enjoyed the track \\"After All ( The Dead), and TV Crimes, but my favorite is the wicked song \\"I\\". Dio's voice comes schreeching through on it with an evil menancing tone. Another complaint is that the great song \\"Computer God\\" was left off. Also \\"Time Machine\\" and \\"Sins of the Father\\" could have been included. I really enjoyed the live version of \\"Children of the Sea\\", a classic from \\"Live Evil\\".     The new Sabbath song \\"The Devil Cried\\" was next,and WOW! What a fanatstic song! Heavey, dark and forbidding. \\"Shadow of the Wind\\", and \\"Ear in the Wall\\" are really great songs and it really shows that at 60+ Dio and his bandmates can still rock. If you love Sabbath and the Dio era, buy this CD!     Let's hope that there is more in the future from these guys, they can still rock!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|If this movie doesn't get you in the mood to strap on armor and pickup a sword and shield then you have something wrong with you!  This adaptation of Frank Miller's depiction of the Battle of Thermopalye is guaranteed to get your heart pumping with its stirring battle scenes and talk of \\"Freedom\\".  For you historians, some winking and nodding must be done to Miller's version, but it is still a a lot of fun.  Enjoy it for what it is, a loose adaptation of a classic story.  Contrary to what the queen says, you will enjoy this!
0763621803|5.0|My \\"almost\\" 5 year old loves when I read her this book, especially with a (granted fake) British accent. She is a lot like Lola with the fussy eating, and her big brother is a lot like Charlie in that he tries to make it fun for her. All in all a great book, and it makes bedtime fun.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Wodehouse conjures a brilliant universe throughout all his work, and the crowning glory is Bertie and Jeeves. This series is priceless. I can watch it again and again--even the less worthy final season, which is admittedly spotty but still amusing for fans. And the rest of the series is ironclad wonderful. Carry on!
B000P2A24W|5.0|Loved this CD.  All the songs were great.  Great melody, great lyrics.   I listen to this CD all the time...Bon Jovi just keeps getting better and better.
6302248299|5.0|Yes! We all have been in a state of imginary circumstances, because at the time real life didn't hold our interest. The comedic skills of Danny Kaye as Walter Mitty lets us view a few of James Thurber's scenarios into a stage of dreams and then into a bit of reality. I too am dreaming of being a reviewer.
0618526412|4.0|It's no fast-paced thriller, nor is it a gripping page-turner, it is however, an incredibly deep look into the heart and soul of man.  Not until you finish the very last page and reflect on what you have read, can you truly begin to understand the simple truth behind the title, `The heart is a lonely hunter.'       The heart of man is lonely, always seeking, always needing something... elusive.  We all share the need to feel connected, to be part of a whole.  To know truth, and be at peace.  We are so many disjointed voices that few of us are ever really heard.     Set in the deep South, Carson tells of a deaf mute named John Singer and a group of frustrated individuals that gravitate towards his serene and kindly nature--a young girl, desperate to follow her dreams; a drunkard, willing to impart his wisdom on the uninformed; a black doctor, eager to lift his people to equality; and a café owner, stuck in the routines of life.    Each seek Singer's company and tell of their woes with a deep believe that he, and only he, truly understands their ply.  In him, each sees a kindred spirit.  But what, exactly, does Singer see in them?
0440238609|5.0|Dark Materials great fantasy read...unconventional, great characters,  and quite a bit of sci-fi mixed in with the magic
0790731509|5.0|This, the story of a Southern chain gang in the post-WWII South, is one of my top ten favorite movies. Growing up, it had legendary status in my household. My dad, my brother, and I quoted from it all the time. Even today, I can break into a Strother Martin impersonation (\\"When a man's mother dies....\\") that gets my dad laughing. Simply put, this is just about a perfect movie. It contains the classic eating of 50 eggs scene (where, if you didn't get the Jesus symbolism by then, is made pretty obvious). But the car washing scene is pretty classic, too (even if the woman looks more \\"60s\\" than the rest of the movie). The script is fantastic, the locations are evocative of the time and place, and the actors all put in great performances. George Kennedy won an Oscar for his turn as the prison fixture, Dragline; and unfortunately, they don't make them like Strother Martin (dead) and Harry Dean Stanton (still acting) anymore. The cast is so good that Joe Don Baker and Dennis Hopper appear, though only on the margins. And as for this movie's star, well, Paul Newman gives his best performance as Luke, who epitomizes the American rebel. Think James Dean goes to prison and you have Cool Hand Luke. It's hard to believe Newman was around 40 when he made this movie. He looks a lot younger. The book the movie is based on was written by an ex-con safecracker, who had served time on a chain gang. The movie certainly has authenticity (even though it was filmed in Stockton, California, not the Deep South). For me, this is Newman's best movie, a great story about a man's self-destructive rebellion against authority.
0066620996|5.0|Good to great is a great first step in understanding how to aim a company, big or small, toward greatness.  It's work in case studies is truly groundbreaking and should be required reading in any of America's top business schools.  For example, asking the key question: What do you do better than anyone else in the world?  This is fundamental to positioning a company to rise above others and move toward and to real greatness.  The work is excellent.  It will be the reference work for a long, long time.<br /><br />One point, I keep looking for books that are strong follow-ups to James C. Collins' Good to Great.  One of them is my book, The Underdog Advantage, by David Morey and Scott Miller, and published by McGraw-Hill.  The Underdog Advantage is filled with checklists and pragmatic battlefield \\"How-Tos\\" that can take Collins' brilliant book to the next and critically important stage of follow up and execution.  Both books are wonderful reading companions.  I recommend both in the highest terms.  Humbly submitted.
0606348549|5.0|All I can say is that this book is easily one of the best that I have ever read its got everything love,mystery,hate,truth,blame and it definatly has its share of twists and turns so buy it read it and keep reading it because this book will become part of your soul and stay with you forever Jodi Picoult has a gift when it comes to looking into the souls of her charectors so read get lost in the world of Chris and Emily and let this book become a part of you

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I don't think I have ever listened to a CD as much as I do this one...it never gets old!<br />After seeing Wicked on Broadway in December 2005, I went immediately to a store (while I was still in New York) and bought this CD so I could listen to it on the flight home.  Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel make an incredible pair, and the harmonies are absolutely fabulous!!<br /><br />I would recommend this for fans of the musical, Broadway lovers, or just about anybody really.  This is a must have!
032147404X|4.0|So far this book gives good insight. It is more difficult to apply to non-Canon or Nikon cameras. But for the most part it's helping.<br /><br />I'd have giving it 5 stars, but the binding has been falling apart since I received it.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|I am a BIG fan of Manu and I am very happy to see that after a long time he's back with a great album wich is a mixture of different lenguages, funny lyrics and great music, not an empty one but rather an album that you would be listening from the begining until the end and turning your player's repeat button on.      It is not as good as El Clandestino, but very close, to me that is the best album ever released by any author and I dont think that anybody, not even manu (and I really hope I am wrong with it), will ever release an album as good as that one. Still this album is very good, I am very happy with it, get it and see for yourself I believe you won't repent.  I hope manu considers coming back to Cuenca to give us another great concert, if so I'm on first row again to sing his new hits with him.  Now I'm going to write something in spanish which is my native language, I hope it is useful to somebody:  Luego de mucho tiempo Manu esta de vuelta con un gran album, otro de esos que quieres oir y oir de principio a fin, hay varios idiomas, letras divertidas y buena musica, te aseguro que no te arrepentiras si lo adquieres.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|i had heard they were going to split this movie up for it's release on DVD and hoped it was just a bad rumor but hey maybe quentin really needs the extra 20 million. I won't buy it until they release both films for one low price.  Don't care how long it takes.
0751517089|5.0|The tale of Nick Leeson's catastrophic trading that brought about the collapse of Baring's bank is perhaps the most famous scandal in banking history. It is also an absolutely fascinating read. Although the film version of the story is gripping and intense, nothing can compare to the written word when portraying the terror, panic and inner turmoil that Leeson went through as his 88888 account losses spun out of control.<br /><br />Far from being a cold clinical recounting of a messy financial scandal, Leeson's book is a far more personal tale. The stories about his struggles at Barings are interspersed with tales about his personal life in Singapore as well as his marriage to his wife Lisa. Indeed as his professional problems began to mount, Lisa became increasingly the rock that he clung to for salvation.<br /><br />Some of the ways in which Leeson's actions went undetected are simply mind boggling. It is astonishing that some of the higher ups at Barings didn't get prosecuted for criminal negligence, but I suppose that's the way of the business world. Even if you have already seen the movie, I wouuld strongly advise you to read this fascinating book, as it is impossible to beat the written account of Leeson's roller coaster ride.
B000002UAU|5.0|Over the years, the music of The Beatles has been praised, scrutinized, criticized, and listened to by millions of people. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the acclaimed album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, a major landmark in the band's history. For this reason, now is as good a time as any for zealous fanatics to revisit the album, or for younger generations to experience the historical Sgt. Pepper for the first time.     The Beatles formed in 1960 and had gained immense popularity by 1964.  When Sgt. Pepper was released in 1967, members Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr had reached a level of superstardom previously unattained (or even imagined) by any musical group. By this point in their career, The Beatles' immense fame and evolving music style had made touring impossible, but the group's lack of live, public performances in no way hurt their popularity.    Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is an eclectic mix of tracks, but it is a collection that The Beatles' blended perfectly together. The album gracefully transcends musical genres, and still sounds fresh and new forty years later. For example, the album includes the psychedelic \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" the experimental \\"Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\\" and the cabaret show tune song titled \\"When I'm Sixty-Four.\\"     The individual influence of each band member is clearly present, such as the drummer Ringo's vocals in \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" and George's sitar playing on his creation \\"Within You, Without You.\\" But even though each of the Fab Four contributed new and different ideas, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band still sounds like a Beatles record, overall.    In conclusion, The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band remains a great album even forty years later. Sgt. Pepper would be a good starting point for any new Beatles fan, and can be recommended to anyone who appreciates sixties culture.
B000002G23|5.0|This really is a complete set of works by The Police.  The cds progress through the songs chronologically, which I really like.  You can follow the progression of their song writing and style over the time they were together.  There a few added extras of live performances and second cuts of songs.  If you're a Police fan this is a must own.
1401211909|5.0|Many moviegoers did not realize that the recently released movie Stardust was actually based on a story by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Charles Vess. The book Stardust (Being a Romance Within the Realm of Faerie) was originally released in 1997, but is now receiving more attention thanks to the film.<br /><br />The breezy 212-page book (including illustrations) could be considered more a story than a true novel, but Stardust's brevity does not mean that it lacks a swiftly moving plot and creative characters. The romantic story is about the young love-struck Tristran Thorn who journeys to find a falling star to give to the beautiful, but haughty, Victoria Forester to win her love. To Tristran's surprise, however, the star turns out to be a woman named Yvaine. And Yvaine does not make for an easy traveling partner. Her powers attract power-hungry princes and evil witches, who pursue the duo throughout the novel.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman has written both science fiction and fantasy graphic novels, comics, and books. Among these works are the popular comic The Sandman and the novel American Gods. Gaiman also co-wrote the screenplay for the movie Beowulf, coming to theaters this year. His writing can be compared to the works of C.S. Lewis and Douglas Adams.<br /><br />Stardust is an engaging read because it is infused with compelling originality. Despite the reappearance of familiar fairytale motifs like wicked witches and magic emblems, the story still feels fresh and unique. The plot is mostly driven by Tristran and Yvaine's journey through the mystical land of Faerie, but there are also several subplots that keep the story moving and interesting. For example, in one chapter, Tristran and Yvaine are stranded on a cloud. There, they are rescued by Captain Alberic and his crew of lightning-harvesters on a flying ship. This scene, among others, gives the book a sense of wonder. In addition to the text, Charles Vess' beautiful illustrations and sketches are a supplement that completes the book's nostalgic fairytale feel, and make the story feel alive to the reader.<br /><br />Overall, Stardust is an original book that will easily satisfy any fans of the fantasy genre, romantics, or anyone who is looking for a light-hearted, enjoyable read.nostalgic fairytale feel, and make the story feel alive to the reader.

076531178X|4.0|This book has some complexities to its \\"world\\" that makes it a little hard to grasp in the first book. Having to do with the power of metals give to certain people.  I had difficulty wondering how they could eat and burn all that metal and not be toxic, but anyway the characters were interesting and it did make we want to read book 2 to see how it would end. Book 2 was much better
0761145613|5.0|I buy this great calendar every yearsince its first publication for each of our four offsprings' famillies. It has become the heart of organization for all, and each successive year's is looked forward to with great anticipation! It is simply the best... no one else comes close! It makes for a very with-it home, with instant event references for everyone. From scoccer games to dance recitals, dentist appointments, birthdays, anniversaries, it's easy to track them all, for all. For the not-yet-reading crowd the stickers make the days stand out.

1594489505|4.0|This book tells two stories.  One is the story of a friendship between two women, forced by their circumstances into marriage with an older, mean-spirited man.  Though at first they view each other as adversaries, they grow to be close friends, providing each other with support and comfort from the ravages of their abusive husband.  This story is very human, and illustrates the power people have to endure hardships in their lives.<br /><br />The other story is the story of Afghanistan, from the Soviet invasion, to the victory of the Mujaheddin, to the tribal warfare and the ultimate rise of the Taliban.  We witness the horrors of the indiscriminate killing during the tribal warfare, and the insanity of the Taliban's ultra-conservative interpretations of Islamic law.  Here we have, perhaps, the clearest description of the chaos that has been Afghanistan's recent past.<br /><br />The two stories, together make for a potent mixture, one that leaves plenty of food for thought.
0375758992|3.0|This memoir really brings its setting to life. It pulses with the sights, smells and sounds of Africa, and does a great job describing civil war, droughts, dysentery, fleas, floods, poachers, scorpions, terrorists and very bad roads. I actually cringed when I read how the putzi flies lay eggs on clothes, which then burrow under the skin, \\"becoming maggots, bursting into living, squirming boils, emerging as full-blown, winged flies.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the narrative is weak. The author has a staccato writing style that really gets in the way. In fact, that, and the book's casual racism, made it hard for me to keep reading. It didn't help that so many of the characters are impossible to respect. The alcoholic parents seem to revel in putting their children in harm's way. The mom in particular is hard to take. I kept wanting to slap her, and tell her to stop crying in her beer.
B000002U8G|5.0|If you were to disect echoes, you would hear pieces of Wish you were Here -the album, Dark Side And The Wall already...That this album was pinacle for the band is an understatement. So much of their jamming was incohesive and sporadic before this point that it wasn't connecting to the listener or even themselves. Here in Echoes is an introduction to everything that would follow that was good. That they magnified and took the themes to new directions was a work of genius...most bands would not be able to do what they did from this point, but the rest is history. In Echoes you can hear Breath, Shine and so many other pieces of work...how incredible to discover this album, after the fact. Of course i heard it after everything else was said and done, but it's worth a listen. Obscured by clouds is good too. I think Obscured has some very intense spacial moments that they would also captialize on, but here is Echoes and Meddle....the real beginnig of this band.
B000062YB1|1.0|First of all, for those of you calling Slayer \\"Thrash,\\" that seems a bit off. Slayer is more like Death metal without the low Death voice. For those saying Araya can't sing, you are crazy. He's got one of the best voices in metal. For all of you calling this one of Slayer's best, you don't really like Slayer. I have only heard Show No Mercy, Reign In Blood, the title track and maybe 1 or more songs from South of heaven, Diobolicus Musica, this one, Divine Intervention, I think I've heard hel Awaits, Undisputed Attitude, I think that's all of them. Seasons was the first one I ever bought. It scared me to listen to it because I wasn't too sure about delving into something with such cover art, and Dead Skin Mask  was scaaary. So I listened for a while, knowing I'd heard some of their earlier stuff and not being able to handle listening all the way through because it was so evil. I must say that is why I enjoyed this album at the time, because it was a mellower Slayer, and I could listen all the way through without feeling like I was going to be sacrificed at a Satanic ritual. So I though I'd buy the next one too, Divine Intervention, and the more I listend to DI, the more I couldn't stop listening, and the less Seasons appealed to me. Now i can listen to all Slayer and Seasons is my least favorite, but I still like to make mix tapes and include songs from Seasons, like for example it mixes really well with White Zombie's La Sexorcisto Devil Music Vol. 1 cd.     Band I would call thrash would be Exodus, Anthrax, Overkill, maybe the original lineup and Kill'em All Metallica.
080701429X|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book because I thought it would only be about the horrors of the concentration camps which we have all heard about for decades.

Great book, I'm glad I finally took the time to read it.

0374105235|5.0|To many people turn a blind eye to the kind of events told by Ishmael Beah.  To not only have to witness this level of carnage but to later participate in it gives a unique point of view that has yet to be matched.    Ishmael's life is one you hope never has to happen to anyone.  It is far too sad to know that this is not only his tale, but the tale of many other boy soldiers.
6305428352|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I still watch it all of the time! The reason I got this was for a new teacher to inspire him, but there are so many good things about this movie. The best part about it is that ten people can watch it and get ten different ideas of what the movie was about.
0780622553|5.0|Here is a film rich with atmosphere, mystery, set in a puzzling retro-world, almost a dream-like (nightmare) environment.  My only complaint is a lack of explanation as to why the hero has the power to \\"tune\\".  Otherwise this is my favorite Sci-Fi movie.  You can see how it must've inspired the Matrix.  The extras are great.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|Wow! What a great disc, great recording of a great live concert. Neil returnes \\"back Home\\" in 1971 to play some of his \\"hits\\" up to then like \\"Tell Me Why\\". Only 8 of the 17 songs were released on previous recordings, so the audience is hearing songs like \\"Old Man\\", \\"The Neddle and the Damage Done\\", \\"Ohio\\", and \\"Down By The River\\" for the first time. Neil plays a Martin D-45 Acoustic. The Rosewood and Spruce just rings and sings on this recording, great lows that sound as if he is accompanied by a bass player, but it's only him and a Guitar! He also plays an upright piano especially in a \\"show tune from his movie\\" Man Needs a Maid which then moves into a rough short version of Heart of Gold Suite. A beautiful and timeless recording that sounds as fresh today as it did over 30 years ago.

B000QUCNOK|1.0|The book was fabulous.  The film adaptation is horrid.  Where to begin?  Dustin Hoffman is a fine actor, but nothing of his ability and screen power come thru in this film.  Ben Whishaw?  Forget it.  His performance is bland and boring, his performance lacking any emotion or inspiration.  You simply don't care about him as a character.  In fact, that is the primary fault of the entire film.  Character development is so poor that you simply don't care what happens to anyone in the film.    Alan Rickman, as usual, delivers a strong screen presence, but his role is so small that he cannot possibly save the film.  John Hurt with his characteristic voice also does a fine job of narrating the film.    Perfume is an excellent novel - a unique, well-developed story.  Definitely read the book!  But the film is a real stinker (pun intended).

0380804557|4.0|This book was a nice fast read, and had some fairly interestesting and unexpected twists to keep you entertained. There were also some really racy parts, though, making it not for kids, though I would think they would love the basic story. I haven't seen the movie yet, and anticipate that it will be interesting to compare.

0061020710|4.0|The first book in the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett is a lot of fun. Rincewind the cynical dropout wizard finds himself traveling across the Discworld acting as a guide/ gaurdian of the naive Twoflower and his vicious, magical trunk.   The story is a lot of fun, reminiscent at times of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories, as well as Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Gude to the Galaxy, in the general comic tone and episodic nature of the story.
0743486285|5.0|I could not put this book down. I read it in one sitting. Not only is it a great read, the format of passages interspersed with lost lyrics, photos, and artwork is fantastic, and made it much more of a multi-dimensional experience than merely reading words.  The words themselves tell a story that is tragic, heart-wrenching, shocking, gritty and at times sickening in their truth.  This is a story of the un-glamorous disease of addiction in the glamorous world of entertainment and rock and roll.  The honesty is brutal, and it left me changed.  I have nothing but admiration for Nikki in his willingness to share this unflattering aspect of his life in the effort to save if only one soul.  Many thanks for this gift.

B000ICL3KG|3.0|Al Gore mentions in this documentary that he has given his presentation on global warming more than a thousand times.  It is worth watching if for no other reason than to see graphic presentation software put to excellent use.  Gore has also put a lot of thought and practice into his verbal presentation, which is effective, if not as spectacular as his graphic presentation.    Gore is convincing when he asserts that there is a secular global warming trend that has accelerated in recent decades, and when he asserts that human activity is (mostly) responsible for this trend.  Other aspects of his presentation are less convincing.  The paragraphs below summarize what I thought were the strongest and weakest aspects of his presentation:    - He shows some persuasive graphs to illustrate evidence of climate change and show how climate change is related to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  But because the graphs are not properly labeled, inaccurate conclusions can be drawn from them, and Gore seems to almost invite his audience to draw these erroneous conclusions.  For example, he shows a time series graph, extending over tens of thousands or perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, that compares global temperatures and CO2 concentrations (these series are based on analysis of gases contained in bubbles in glacial ice).  The two series of data are obviously highly correlated, so Gore scores a legitimate point there.  He then extends one of the series to show the current level of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the trend line rises almost vertically: since the data point is more than twice as high on the graph as the highest natural levels seen over thousands of years, it appears that CO2 concentrations have increased more than 100 percent over the natural background level.  In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), established by the UN Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, reported in 2007 that CO2 concentrations have increased 35 percent over the natural background level.  One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that Gore omitted a portion of the Y-axis, making changes appear more dramatic than they actually are.  A lot of people do this when they draw graphs, but they normally show the axes and label them so that viewers will draw correct conclusions.    - While Gore effectively refutes some objections advanced by global warming skeptics, he goes too far in suggesting that any skepticism at all must be motivated by bad faith.  For example, he ridicules skeptics (he calls them \\"so-called\\" skeptics) who think that the current warming trend might be caused by natural phenomena that caused past warming and cooling cycles.  In fact, climate cycles caused by variations in the earth's orbit, solar activity, and volcanoes have existed throughout the historical record, and it has taken decades of scientific investigation to exclude them as alternative explanations.  The IPCC reported for the first time in 2007 that \\"most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse concentrations.\\"  The term \\"very likely\\" is used by the IPCC to refer to a probability of more than 90 percent, a lower limit commonly used by scientists to conclude that a research result is reliable.  Previously, the degree of uncertainty was higher, implying a stronger basis for skepticism.  And of course the IPCC's currently asserted confidence of more than 90 percent does not eliminate all doubt either.    - Gore at times draws causal links between global warming and individual local weather events that are not supported by scientific evidence.  For example, he mentions that Hurricane Katrina strengthened from a category 1 hurricane to a category 4 hurricane as it crossed warm water in the Gulf of Mexico, implying that this strengthening was a result of global warming.  In fact, Katrina strengthened over the Gulf of Mexico because it is shallower and warmer than the Atlantic Ocean.  It is speculative at best to suppose that Katrina might have been a weaker hurricane in the absence of human-caused climate change.      - Somewhat related to the previous point, Gore employs a graph showing an increase in insurance losses in recent decades, implying that global warming has increased severe weather in the United States.  Perhaps it has, but surely the increased density and value of construction in vulnerable coastal areas has also contributed to these higher losses.    - Near the end of the film, Gore takes on the tradeoff that exists between economic growth and environmentalism.  He essentially denies that such a tradeoff exists, maintaining that \\"doing the right thing\\" will create jobs and \\"move us forward.\\"  This is disingenuous.  I would rather see Gore argue that, yes, there is a cost associated with developing and deploying cleaner technologies, but we can afford it.  (Of course the tradeoff is more severe for developing countries that are struggling to provide a decent standard of living for their people.)    Having criticized many aspects of Gore's presentation in this film, I want to emphasize that I think his central points are correct: humans are responsible for significant climate change and we need to try to minimize the impacts of human activity.      Gore is portrayed sympathetically in a series of vignettes that show him with his older sister (who later died of lung cancer, causing the Gore family to stop growing tobacco), with his six-year old son after a serious accident (which caused Gore to rethink his priorities), and so on.  These are very affecting, but let's keep our wits about us: Al Gore is a politician, not the selfless visionary that this documentary portrays him to be.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|The first time I saw Eraserhead, I found it difficult to understand. Actually, very difficult. INLAND EMPIRE is Lynch's most ambitious and densely packed film to date, makes EH look like a Bugs Bunny cartoon in comparison. Yet that is the fun of Lynch's films. To be able to go back again and again and try to decipher the meaning of the film. And yes, there is meaning to this film. It just may take me a couple of years to figure it out for myself. But I, for one, am tired of being spoon-fed movies that are churned out just to make a quick buck. I think most people go to the theatre, shell out their money, and are content to be entertained for two hours. Lynch gives you so much more with his imagery and sound design. This film stays with you. If you want to see an easily comprehensible film and would rather not use your brain while watching it, then INLAND EMPIRE is not for you. I'm surprised to see Lynch fans give this film a bad review. Anyway, it's worth a try, you'll never see anything else quite like it, and there's also your stop and eject button should it come to that.
0143038419|4.0|After a nasty divorce, author Elizabeth Gilbert spends a year traveling to Italy, India, and Indonesia.  This is not a travel book, but rather a book of searching for self discovery and strength.  Gilbert finds both in great measure.  She describes her journey and escapades along the way  wonderfully with fun wit and nice depth.  A friend loaned me this book, but there were many times I had wished it were my own so that I could highlight certain passages.  Some of Gilbert's insights are so dead-on you want to retrieve them for later.    Two in particular that I remember (and, like i said, I don't own the book so can't quote exactly) were to practice strength and staying pulled together.  If your usual mode is to fall apart when things don't go your way, then that is what you will do because that is what you have practiced doing.    Instead, make your typical practice be to be strong and stoic.  Practice it like a habit, every time.  I have used this on my kids so many times in recent weeks (ages 8 and 3). \\"Practice being strong, now.  You can do it! Think how proud of yourself you will be.\\"    One other thing I took away was the notion of growing and nurturing your own happiness, then guarding it with everything you've got.  Don't let anything destroy your happiness.  Choose happiness then sow and tend your happiness like a precious garden.  Don't let any pests in without your permission.    There are lots of good things in this book.  The only thing I fought with was the jealousy I felt at someone actually being so unencumbered that they could travel for a year without worry.  Must be nice!  Is Elizabeth Gilbert self-absorbed?  Sure! But in a nice way.  And, besides, aren't all of us who read books for pleasure also not self-absorbed?    A gem.  Highly recommended.

I originally bought each individual season, then had to buy the 50 lb limited box cabinet set but then had to get rid of that to make way for this compact set.    Takes up very little space and is the neatest way to collect all seasons in one package.     Hopefully there will be a reunion special in the future for the gang.    now if we could just get a box set in either HD-DVD or BluRay.

B00006GA48|5.0|I've always thought Closer to Home was Grand Funk's best album, but unfortunately I also felt the sound was quite possibly the worst of any Grand Funk record, with the possible exception of their first one, On Time.  Terry Knight would certainly not rate on anyone's list of greatest rock producers in history; he did alright on a few Grand Funk records, but really botched some others, Closer to Home being among them.  I don't normally upgrade from an original release to a remastered CD, but I thought this one was certainly worthy of an upgrade so I picked it up last night at a local independent retailer.  I was very pleasantly surprised with the results.  Everything is much more clear as opposed to muddy on the original, especially Mark Farner's guitar and voice.  Songs which benefit the most from this new remastered version:  I Don't Have to Sing the Blues and I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home).<br /><br />There are four bonus tracks, starting with an alternate studio mix of Mean Mistreater.  When I first heard it, I thought, \\"why did they leave out that organ part on the original?  This sounds better.\\"  Reading the liner notes, it's obvious I'm not the only one who feels that way:  \\"On this long-awaited, fully-remastered CD reissue, we are treated to a Mean Mistreater bonus track that features Mark's organ part as well as the electric piano.  Why they chose to strip the organ part off the song when the album's track order was set in stone is something of a mystery.  Many will no doubt now agree that the track sounds even better with the organ part intact.\\"<br /><br />Three LIVE bonus tracks follow:  In Need, Heartbreaker and Mean Mistreater.  In case you Funk fans are wondering, all three were recorded 6/25/70 at Orlando Sports Center, Florida.  They are different live versions of the same three tunes which appeared on Grand Funk Live Album, all three of which were recorded only two days earlier at Jacksonville Coliseum, Florida.  Great stuff, but I could have done without three versions of Mean Mistreater on the same record.<br /><br />The Closer to Home remaster is a must have for any Grand Funk fan.  FYI the entire Grand Funk collection (or most of it anyway) was remastered in 2002.

0670038040|4.0|Since it dealt with the stunned and paranoid Britain of post 7-7-05 this was unquestionably the most topically modern Rumpole novel of all. For Mortimer to take on the crushing of civil rights in this decade was a departure from the lighthearted simplicity of most (note I am saying most) Rumpole cases we've been privileged to read about these many years. I loved seeing Horace Rumpole and the familiar gang set into modern times and knowing that this check-in finds them alive, well, and as true to form as ever, but let's face it, anyone who couldn't see where this plot was heading was a bit innocent in the faculties, and the conclusion to it all represented yet another in a long chain of deus ex machina style endings Mortimer has long favored. I had to get that much said but make no mistake I enjoyed the book a lot, just do wish John Mortimer would add a few twists here and there in these pleasant, character-driven tales of crime and courtrooms, law chambers and the goings on in the venerable Rumpole \\"mansion flat.\\"
B000001GQY|5.0|In short: No.1: As  orchestral interpretation(Jochum-BP), only comparable with Giulini-Philharmonia and as piano playing only comparable with Arrau, Rubinstein and Curzon. Gilels' playing is romantic, powerful and splendid; Arrau's playing is philosophic, deep and deppressive; Rubinstein's playing is poetic,luminous and lively; Curzon's playing is lyric, thoughtful and elegant. No.2: Only comparable with Richter, Backhaus, Arrau and Anda.     This is not-to-be-missed and essential set for Brahms lovers.

This story about the civil war in Sierra Leone is filled with shocking details of how children are conscripted into the army or rebel camps and forced to take drugs which essentially turn them into killing machines.  This story grips you from the 1st page and keeps you going to the very end.  This is a must read!
0385522401|4.0|For my first bite at the McEwan apple, I was quite impressed. On Chesil Beach was beautifully written and I loved what he wrote...for the most part. I feel the book is best talked about in two parts: 1) the wedding day 2) the rest of the book.     In that first part, the wedding day, we have a man and woman who are as awkward with each other as they are in love. They fumble through conversation before fumbling at each other's clothing. They have never had difficulty communicating, but there is one glaring oversight in their conversational past: he could not wait to get into bed with her and she did not want to ever get into bed with him. The chapters that chronicle that day were rife with sexual tension and apprehension, and they were often pretty descriptive.     (I can accept that Americans are typically considered prude by the rest of the world, and if you have ever been uncomfortable by adult situations and bizarrely literary sexual euphemism in text you may have to skip over a few paragraphs.)     To characterize the second part of the book, that which did not occur on the couple's wedding day, I would consider it beautiful in its simplicity and innocence. The care with which McEwan handled their relationship as it budded through the soil was perfectly gentle. I really enjoyed how much of the story revolved around both Edward and Florence's families. Their separate family dynamics showed how they found solice in each other's company; they were each other's escape into a new-found reality.     On Chesil Beach was wonderfully tragic, if tragedy can be wonderful; (a little) funny; and all-around superbly written. Ian McEwan has been a celebrated author for many years and if On Chesil Beach is representative of his earlier work it is not difficult to see why he has received such praise.
B00001U0DP|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this movie.  I read the raving reviews and thought it would be great but it wasn't. Some parts were funny but I don't think you can make light on something as dreadful as the Holocaust no matter how good the acting is. I think this is taking dark humor too far and I found it extremely offensive and over rated!
B000UJCALI|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Stanley Kubrick's The Shining very much. It is my favorite adaptation of Stephen King's works. But this DVD just sucks. The Shinning was shot in full-screen, so this DVD is cropped. Also this DVD is missing over 20 minutes of footage. I repeat: Steer clear of this crappy DVD.  Stick with the last release, because it does the film justice.    P.S. The only one of these 5 new releases of Kubrick's films that is worth buying is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The rest are not worth buying.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|A truly wonderful album. Mysterious and magical. one of my favorites. Another favorite of mine is [[ASIN:B000U1ZKUY Dreams & Visions]] by Mary-Kathryn. Devotional and spiritual, a beautiful inspired voice and various world influences make this new album a gem!
B000T5O48U|5.0|Cujo fans have waited a while for this. A special edition of this Stephen King classic. This film rocks. It is better than the book. It is very realistic. You can expect good picture quality and some very good extras on this. The cover art is good too. Recommended.
B000002HK4|4.0|I disagree with those who call this underrated, and you will see why when you do some browsing of the reviews on here and other sites. There are actually a lot of people who consider this to be Dream Theater's best song. I am admittedly a huge fan of these guys, but I definitely think it's quite a stretch to call this their greatest moment.<br /><br />Firstly, if you didn't already know, \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" is pre-Images & Words material that got shelved for some reason until this EP release in '95. The song itself is surprisingly simple for Dream Theater, but in my opinion that is where the fault lies. Anytime you record a 23 minute song, you should be very careful about repetition, so as not to make things too mundane. There are some great moments to the opening opus, shifting between a lot of different moods, going from soft to heavy, fast to slow, and everything else DT is good at. It is indeed an outstanding classic piece in Dream Theater's history. Whether or not it's their best song is up for debate though.<br /><br />The live tracks are interesting too, and despite there obvious use as filler, keep in mind that the unreleased track on this EP IS 23 minutes long. All that said, I think this is certainly an essential for DT fans, and since it is kind of restrained in the wankery department, even people who usually dislike DT may find something enjoyable here.
B00005RHGL|5.0|George Cosmatos' \\"Tombstone\\" is pure and simply a masterpiece, nothing more, nothing less.    It begins with a brief description of the Cowboys gang that ran things in that part of the frontier.  The narrator (Robert Mitchum) describes them as the earliest example of organized crime in US history.  Not true.  But if you want to learn history by watching movies, be my guest.  The narrative serves its purpose in setting up the viewer for the rest of the film.    Former Dodge City lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) arrives in Tombstone, AZ with his brothers, Morgan and Virgil (Bill Paxton and Sam Elliott).  Law enforcement doesn't pay well and a silver boomtown is just the business opportunity they are looking for.  Of course, there are things going on in Tombstone that Virgil Earp will not ignore and you always back brothers hand.  Events lead up to the climatic shoot out at the OK Corral, the most documented gunfight in history.    What is great about this film?  The cast of this film had fun disappearing into their roles.      Kurt Russell gives an excellent performance Wyatt Earp.  His Wyatt is a hard, tough man with a sense of decency.  Stephen Lang (a brilliant character actor on the level of John Turturro) is invisible behind the persona of Ike Clanton.  Powers Boothe is Curly Bill Brocius.  Dana Delany is Josephine Marcus the true love of Wyatt's life.     To add to this colorful cast, we have some interesting cameos.  Charlton Heston plays a rancher sheltering Doc Holiday.  Western movie icon, Harry Caray Jr., (one of the John Ford players) plays the elderly town marshal.  A very fat Billy Bob Thornton is a card dealer who finds out just how hard Wyatt Earp can be.    But I come to the really outstanding performance belongs to Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday.  He steals every scene with a fine, nuanced performance.  He's got the best lines in the script.  Or maybe it seems that way because of the way he says them.  His match is the sociopathic Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn).  Their final confrontation is the now classic scene \\"I'm your huckleberry.\\"     You'll want to watch this film more than once.
1594200696|5.0|The illustrated hard cover edition comes has a brilliant red woven hard cover.  The illustrations by Maira Kalman complement the text very well.  Highly recommended for all the writers in your life.
0321344758|4.0|I think this is a great book.  It uses common sense terms and it is easy to understand.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005JKG9|4.0|This star studded movie pulls you in and won't let you go.  Glengarry Glen Ross is the story of Real Estate Salesmen down on their luck who are being threatened by their company and decide to fight back.  Although I am not personally a salesmen the movie makes you sympathize with the characters.  I find it interesting that this movie is very well known with really well known actors and yet it only really takes place in two settings, the office & the chinese food restaurant across the street.  This is the kind of movie with memorable lines almost like a Quentin Tarrantino movie.  The only complaint I have about this movie is the ending leaves you feeling like there is more to the story.  I highly suggest giving this movie some of your time.    4 out of 5 stars.
