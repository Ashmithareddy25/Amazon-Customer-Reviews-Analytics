B0049MIXKO|4|Perfect
B003VAZ20O|5|Good quality and as described
B00YDUXIH0|1|Waste of money
B003LVRGFM|5|Very very good quality!
B0000AXU02|4|Perfect
B009HL7HG8|5|Works as advertised
B00A28QUGS|4|After I placed my order I requested it in blue, I was hoping for more of a cyan but it was closer to navy. Looks good and sticks well to my kayak.
B0069TQL54|5|Woks well. Used them as extra brake lights on mail jeep with a brake light flasher.
B000E6710C|5|Came on time but never installed had a bad mass air flow sensor. Be sure of diagnosis i spent alot of money listening to others when i had a feeling what it was.
B00BUL1KRK|5|love this proiduct over windex or other things out there.  it doesnt leave any streaks and the windows in my car look pristine.
B000EDST1K|5|This is really a great item to have for those rattling range burners while driving and the extra counter space is so nice to have.
B000CIU8O8|3|Great
B002M3O91E|4|I just installed this rack to my 2012 Toyota Sienna. The installation is easy. It is heavy. It is nice. I would give it 4.5 out of 5 Check my video installation review on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4bA0_ABwZo
B000TDT8KG|4|i dont know if i can give it 5 stars, but this is exaclty as described and was easy to use. Installed a a cipa 10&#34; mirror with this. which actually came with its own metal attachment but no glue,<br />this has now been in my truck for 2 weeks, with no problems
B0012PPPNO|1|Had to return this part.  It should perform a marine timing curve (linear advance from idle to cruise RPM).  Total advance should have been about 22*.  The part I received only advanced 10*, and it did this in a sudden jump.  The boat couldn't exceed 3100 rpm with this module.  Went with another brand.  Maybe I just received a bad module?
B0063GKHPI|5|Worked well, if used as directed, key is prep.
B001G54LRQ|5|I knew it had to be good from other reviews, but let me tell you it was better than good it was excellent and it fits my 2015 street glide special to the tee, I've had a lot of covers that cost more than this one but this is by far the best motorcycle cover I ever owned........ Thank you
B00SWBSLEG|1|They don't work for correcting your canbus issues as advertised
B008TL6RT0|3|Wow, what a great price.<br />Works great on my 2005 Pathfinder and 2010 Camaro SS.<br />Did not work on my 97 Z28 ... I don't think it supports VPW (pre CAN GM).
B000CKLJ12|5|Just as advertised in a SKF box too.
B000COB5LM|4|I purchased one of these after my bushing finally fell apart it arrived very fast and was pleased with it, it take a lot of adjustment but after 15-20minutes had it good enough still dosnt shut 100% like original but it does a good job eliminates door rattle and will wear down bushing after a couple of days and eventually shut like it used to...overall the product was very durable and looked like you ordered from the factory.
B002CZ16P4|5|They're lightbulbs, they work, what more could you want?
B0045WBVUM|5|Loved it, was very comfortable but returned it because we decided to just get a new seat on bike. Awsome transaction. Money was returned the same day i shipped back. Didn't have to wait.
B00GG9FB8U|5|I was skeptical but this product actually works. I washed the car and there was no need to rinse. This is an excellent product and my car ends up as clean as using the products that require rinsing or going to the do it yourself car wash. One thing to keep in mind is to to have multiple cloths and to wash from the top of the car down so that the dirt and filth doesn't just spread across the vehicle.
B002FWX6M0|3|adhesive could be better, parts of the whiskers have started to come up after a car wash.
B000BZI4K2|3|Very good deal
B00PNU1WCM|3|Arrived with some kinks and dirty spots on the outer parts. once entire length was unrolled it was ok.
B00T2P1TWC|4|Works as expected. This is the second flasher I've bought, and though I knew it wouldn't be adjustable to what my first one looked like, I was a bit disappointed with the anemic flashing pattern. The flash is a bit slow, and more like a blink. There's also no real installation instructions so I had to do a bit of searching to find which way 'round to splice it into the line.
B00ONH8LLG|1|Didn't fit cost me 16.00 to return .
B003TTL0TE|5|This is advantageous because it does the cleaning of the car very well.  I just tried it to clean up my car, really, it does an excellent job, it's highly recommended.
B00042KGWG|4|Depending on your wheel design, the spokes/splines of the wheel may not allow the rubber pad to position against the edge of the rim as per the instructions suggest. I used it on the 20&#34; wheel of a 5th Gen 4Runner Limited and the pad sits below the outer rim. It still worked.<br /><br />Also the plastic coating of the hooks was cut on first time using it and has exposed the bare metal underneath. I am worried that I will have metal-to-metal contact which may damage my alloy rims.<br /><br />All that said, I would still buy it as your vehicle may not have many other lift points.
B009FREAGO|4|It does what it says it will do.  It contains my trash!  I gave it four stars instead of five because when I open it, it opens really wide and at times if the trash is at the top, it will fall back out.  Other than that, I haven't had any issues with it.  It hangs sufficiently in the back and my children do not kick it like I assumed they might.  The strap is adjustable so if I want it to fit snuggly under the headrest it can and other times when I want there to be more space between the headrest I can make the adjustment.
B004XG2FOG|3|The trailer hitch is alright. All hardware was included along with installation instructions. It wasn't a perfect fit, even with the supplied spacers. However, I was able to get it in place and tighten it up sufficiently. The instructions were somewhat helpful but I did some research and found another way to install the hitch that I felt was much easier than Curt's instructions.<br /><br />The packaging of this item was a HUGE disappointment. The hitch had a couple of small foam pads taped on it and was then dropped into a box that was way to big for it with NO other packing materials. This meant that the 30 pound hitch was free to bounce around throughout the box. When the package arrived, the end of the hitch was stabbed through the side of the box.<br /><br />I had high expectations because of the good reviews, and so far the product seems to be pretty good quality for the price, but the horrible packaging gave me a terrible impression of the company. I will continue to use the hitch but I probably won't be buying anything else from Curt.
B000HLUJ8K|5|Have a coil pack Jeep 4.0L engine made after 1998? You need these Champion 438 spark plugs plugs as the newer Chrysler ignition system HATES the new fangled Platinum / Iridium / Tri-Cobalt Chromium Transparent Uranium Star Trek plugs, SplitFire, Tri-Fire and E3 aka &#34;DiamondFIRE&#34; plugs.<br /><br />Those newer techno-plugs *may* possibly function on the older distributor Jeeps, but not on the newer 4.0s. For some weird reason this newer set-up likes the plain old, tried&true no-frills cooper plug. These coil rail 4.0 L Jeeps operate like an older Harley Davidson Sportster where a wasted spark firing is also used on the exhaust cycle.<br /><br />Even Xtra copper plugs for truck applications don't work very well and will throw a code and backfire under acceleration: this applies to all newer coil pack 4.0L: Jeeps like the XJ, TJ and ZJ/WJ/QJ/AJ/BJ/HJ/OJ or whatever they called the Grand Cherokee then.<br /><br />Make sure the gap is at .035&#34; plus use some copper anti-seize on the plug threads and you'll be good to go another 40,000 to 75,000 miles or so with these Champion 438 plugs.<br />Dielectric grease the tops so work will be easier in the future to remove the coil pack / rail.
B000COX90M|5|Worked perfectly on my 2000 Honda Civic but sure you get the right length clamps for your application. I tried the Stud-Fix clamps first but they would not camp tight enough for my application so I tried these and they worked great! Easy to use and the parts can also be changed around to fit over a broken off stud or to fit into a hole that is left. I have ran now for about 4,000 miles and when I just changed oil they were still as tight and snug as I left them. I see know reason why this won't be a permanent fix. Thanks for the great product!
B004TOSD34|5|Awesome bumper, looks like the others and at a great price
B00SYS46HI|5|Fits well in vent and has yet to fall out.
B00DMS648E|1|Was wrong size for my car. Please provide me info on what cars these will fit. I'm not returning because cost was so low. But would've been nice had it worked
B00P2D3VT2|4|so far so good. Light is brighter than cars stocked dome light. every now and then it dims a little even after car is off. will check grounding wires that'll maybe solve this problem
B0000AY4YT|5|Fantastic product. Used with an electric buffer and the finish is near new quality. Just need to be careful around the stickers as it will remove the color with the buffer.
B006ZQ2Q46|1|Ordered twice - returned twice. Both times the regulator appeared used.
B009T4MTLG|5|Great product .
B007FKTXEC|5|excellent
B00Q683YZS|5|Installed this on tractor for rear work light. Install was easy enough with a bracket I had in scrap pile. This puts out an amazing amount of light and the price was very good compared to others I was looking at.
B004ME11FS|5|Arrived on time and in good order; works perfect.
B00WVJR0D8|5|Very bright light! Have bought several lights in the past, but they all failed to make me happy! I will definitely be purchasing more from OPT7.
B00A5AWJMW|5|Works well for my 2013 Honda Accord EX-L for the back seat passenger seatbelt.
B008032ST0|5|worked perfect from the first day and still holding
B00KGBWQO6|5|Finally got time to install the switch today. New switch fit my previously existing switch so just mounted on that bracket. Simply traced the wires from old switch and at every connection disconnected and reconnected to new switch wires. Turned on the switch to the ATV and the new winch switch worked just fine.
B001DCN24U|5|it was so easy to change, thank you so much!!!!
B000COTLDG|5|Worked great! Thanks very much!
B005EJGSQ2|5|Bought this as a gift. The person getting it has back issues and by using this can drive a lot longer between stretch breaks and uses it on his recliner to relax better. He hasn't reported anything negative about using it.
B001S30IGY|5|Did it myself project with new tank for $100 which made it easier.  Very relieved it worked.  Needed to purchace separate snap type ring with holes for snap ring tool for easier installing.  Lubricated neoprene ring and pushed down going around top flange a little bit at a time as I inserted snap ring.
B00KVU70NY|5|A few months with them installed, held up well, don't flicker, high quality.
B009KBUR2Q|4|Feels kinda cheap and too light, but it gets the job done.
B000C5YD42|5|It was a perfect fit for my 02 Toyota Sienna. Thanks!
B00NX4RIO6|5|Cool, stylish caps that I use on my bicycle. I love them!
B001DH81VO|5|Fits perfectly. Has a great car specific set of instructions. I bought the car used, it's probably a 10 year old filter in it. I can't believe how much of a difference it makes in the velocity of air that comes out. It's coming out 2-3 times faster than it was before.
B00YI8E560|5|They came out to be bluer than expected but they still look awesome and I really like them.
B005K09LW8|5|Adds a nice touch to steering wheel.
B004P9GXG2|3|Looks like a knockoff counterfeit. Paint peeled quickly.
B008L0GDMU|4|Great coilovers. I like the fact that skunk2 coilovers are fully assembled with tophats and all. Install was easy, remove old struts and install the skunk2.<br />Con;<br />The only downside is that skunk2 made this application to fit 92-00 Honda Civic. I have the ek model and the brake line bracket installed on the skunk2 front struts are not needed. Also the rear lower control arm bushing is smaller than the eg. So skunk provides two washers to install. Not really a deal breaker, as I understand the cost of manufacturing two different shock housing.<br /><br />I've had this installed for a couple of weeks, it's a great performing coilovers.
B00REYAXQ6|5|This spark plug changed my life.  After installing, my car ran great, but it didn't end there.  My car's paint job looked amazing, and people continually came up to me at Walmart after I'd park my car, and they'd ask what spark plugs I use.  I told them....N...G...K!  At first, they seemed skeptical, as it wasn't a brand they had seen at Walmart, but after I showed them how awesome my car's paint job looked after installing, they gave me several nods of agreement.<br /><br />Not long after installing, I noticed it wasn't just the car's paint job that had improved.  I noticed my tires were not wearing as badly, and the seats were actually more comfortable.  Soon, the goodness of these NGK plugs spread to other non-automotive objects.  My kids started doing better in school, I got promoted a work, and, you might call me crazy, but the weather seems nicer since installing these plugs.<br /><br />I then realized that all of this actually may be related to the gap of the plugs (39.14159).  YMMV
B005NDO8O8|1|Installed kit as per instructions and as soon as i hooked up neg battery terminal blower motor was running on high with out key in ignition. I double checked all connections. Went on Jeep web site and found that problem was in the power module. Went to local auto parts store and bought a new power module, installed new unit and everything work as it should. DEFECTIVE PART.  NOT HAPPY !!!!!
B0049HKFIM|5|Perfect!!!
B009VIDT2S|4|Would be five stars but the parts were mislabeled which led to a week of contacting the manufacturer and waiting for a response. Once the issue was figured out, the installation was a tad bit tedious but not hard at all. Only took about an hour. Looks great, feels solid. The black coat does show scuffs easily so take care of it while installing it.
B00180FWEU|5|These are about half the price that the Ford dealership wanted,...and they're better quality. The original sway bars didn't have grease fittings. These do. Also, these are bulkier than the originals.<br />I can't speak about how long they last, as I just installed them yesterday; but they are easy to install, priced right, and they do what they're supposed to do. No more clanketty noises when going over little bumps in the road.<br />So far, I'm impressed.
B0001WW37U|5|Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You'll be so glad you did:-)
B004J378G8|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 STI
B009EFJD6E|5|[[VIDEOID:7761819908c70cf5e752e6fc654f0a37]] this light is very bright!!! I have other lamphus products and I knew I wouldn't be disappointed with this purchase! being somewhat waterproof I decided to put it in my front grill. only thing is I wish it had a random pattern mode. I would recommend lamphus products to anyone!
B005ZWM0R4|5|Better than expected. Quite a lot of data for engine troubleshooting and even tells about pending codes that do not turn on the service engine light. Lets you know if the vehicle is ready for emissions testing. Software is free and installs quick
B00VZKJUUA|5|Great quality! Bought it to put on my '14 Focus Hatchback because I wanted to have a &#34;S&#34; emblem that looked stock. Can't even tell it's not stock! My Focus has a &#34;sport package&#34; and wanted to have a &#34;sport&#34; emblem on the outside.
B00HR26U0S|5|Nice upgrade. Huge difference from the yellowish to nice bright white. Love it. Remember, This is a complete set that comes with the external LEDS for the license plate as well. My 2013 Honda Civic looks good with these LEDS. Two in the front dome, Two in the back Dome, One in the trunk. And the Two external LEDS for the license plate. If you are thinking about buying these...don't think..just do it 👍
B00QXYQ25E|5|Item as described. Installs easily. Looks great. A++
B00HYHXUZE|5|Great fit
B00K5WBNTK|5|Easy to put on, looks good. Bought if for my bathroom.
B003IS3HV0|5|It just works.I wish I knew about this 5 years ago. I could have saved myself a lot of money if I just bought this product instead of other crappy brands of leather conditioner and cleaner.
B00282YGGM|4|Works better than the original.
B00LNDQ930|5|works great
B003JXU0JQ|5|best do-it-yourself alarm on the market
B00CAY4TSI|5|Worked right out of the box.
B00AVM9MWO|2|color is off
B008G28DSK|5|These lights are just as described.  Installation was quick.  I am happy.
B00HEAQE7C|5|exact replacement for my 2010 Ford Escape
B006FLMGZA|5|Love these. I wasn't sure about them but after installing them, they make my 2013 Civic stand out. Easy to install. I didn't even use the clips...the 3M tape is super strong. I still filled in the small holes with the caps it comes with for the clips...<br />Love it.
B00BJEZEL6|5|perfect
B000VKPS24|2|This is not like the Volvo OEM filter 30630752 in a few important ways:<br />1. The filter ribs are vertical instead of horizontal.  This makes it harder to bend and install in the XC90.<br />2. The foam and surrounding liner is thicker, making it harder to install.  The filter kind of collapsed when I forced it in, but seemed to settle in once it was in the box.<br />3. The filter is not the same format as OEM.  The Volvo filter has a filter header at the top and this one is just filter.  I don't know the impact of the change, but I expect Volvo had a reason for the plastic header.<br /><br />I was trying to save money on this filter, but don't think it was worth it.  Next time I am going to try the MAHLE Original LA 54 Cabin Air Filter as it looks more like the Volvo OEM but still $20 cheaper.
B00SMH58RI|5|I bought the red/blue lights to test out in my patrol car.  I cut the cigarette plug and splice the wires into my switch box. These light are extremely bright, and I'm not exaggerating. The lights are brighter than my light bar on top of my vehicle.<br /><br />The 16-pattern was nice for me to select the pattern I wanted.<br /><br />Note to other LEO's. I highly recommend placing this on the front windshield to blind the driver during a traffic stop (driver can't see you). I don't recommend placing it in the rear for safety reasons. The lights are so bright, you'll blind drivers behind you.<br /><br />I've included a picture of the light in the center of my dash(taken during the day). Notice how it's brighter than the light bar. The picture was not taken at direct sight. Direct sight blinded my camera.
B000Q0TDCU|5|I decided to purchase this from Amazon because the price was easily $10 cheaper than any auto part store around.  It was the exact shape and size as the stock one on my Hyundai Tucson and it fit the car with no problems.  Very easy to replace.
B00T3M0HJA|5|Had a professional put the top on, great fit!
B0074NPC18|5|fit was good.
B00T6PKK7I|5|Works perfectly.  I like having the calculated mAh reading as well as volts and amps.  Very useful in testing battery backup devices.
B00LOQ4XZ2|5|Love it!! Cute and whimsical! Nice how you can remove the bottom picture to wash it!! They should make different pictures interchangeable!
B005H12QXG|5|Great fit, no vibration, easy install, and super fast shipping
B00G8PNB9I|1|The paint completely came off the front frame within 3 months....
B009W8HCUC|5|Excellent quality. Easy install. Very satisfied. Will get the passenger side as soon as I can afford it.
B013ME9PII|5|I bought these when they first came out a couple years ago. I have them on all of my motorcycles. It's a great idea, and a well made product that deserves your attention.
B00KA00BSQ|5|Great product be sure you buy 2 kits one for each side
B006LBAAD4|5|Having read about premature wear of cam followers on older pre-96 pusheod engines i decided to use it on my 1995 Rover Mini Mayfair, Single Point Injevtion 1275 cc, air conditioned. The grar shift ahifts faster and smoother is the only chnage I've noticed. I fecommended it among Classic Mini racers as they have seen cam follower wear (www.philminiracers.blogspot.com).
B002ZQ7B9A|5|Product was like the one given to me as a gift. Good quality.
B00AN5REV0|2|Make sure you check the size of your wheels. If you have 16&#34; wheels, you need 319mm rotors. This kit is for 15&#34; wheels with 297mm rotors.<br /><br />If you have the 16&#34; wheels, you need the KOE1236 parts. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AN5S23O/
B00KBBL4H6|4|This product is well worth the money.
B0051SUMJA|5|Took me about a 40 minutes to install both. Hardest part is getting your socket wrench on the bolt behind the bottom part of the latch. Nice solid feeling latch. I never did like the original rubber jeep latches as i don't trust the rubber and sometime my hood bounces at freeway speeds. But not with these latches and they look much better too. Before and after pics attached.
B0049DYVVS|5|as described
B0053HNVBA|1|I purchased three of these at the same time...while each key looks distinctly different, all keys work in all locks. I'm very disappointed in such a terrible lock design.
B005EZ0NE4|5|I like this car cover.  It fits like a glove on my Fiat 500.  The slots for the mirrors and the antennae are in the right places.  With all the trees around my house dropping sap, leaves, and sticks this cover is a must have when I'm not driving it on a daily basis.
B008G1ZKGE|5|Excellent quality, shiny finish but as car paint it starts to swirl very quickly, you have to be careful with them to avoid scratching them.
B006O5YMYK|5|Just so everyone knows, these are made to fit over the existing plastic covers.  These are not direct replacements for a missing cover.  I was looking for a replacement for a cover that had come off and so I had to triple up the thickness of the tape with extra mounting tape.  It still doesn't align perfectly but it is good enough.  It does fit perfectly over the other mirror that still had its cover so I guess I'll chock that up to bad assumption on my part.
B000ROPSDI|5|Great replacement part for my  oil pan that had a stripped plug hole.  Perfect fit.  I was deciding between a $35 on ebay part and this one that the chain stores seem to have.<br /><br />Exact fit for my 2004 Sienna.  Solid, heavy duty, perfect.
B0031ZDU62|5|Like the price and replaced original parts.
B00DWVN08I|4|Worked and fit just perfect thank you
B003X93N40|5|Worked for what I needed.
B003YP1R4G|2|This remanufactured compressor had a body seal leak. A slight bummer after all the work I put into it.
B000WK5DZU|4|Great works awsome
B000C9I8WQ|5|Got it today, bought a similar one one that was&#34;reboxed&#34; which didn't last(8 mo.), if this one blows I will pay the extra $45.00 and get it from O'Rileys who guarantees replacement. Emeraldash
B00O72WUZU|5|Great service.  No fit great. Be very gentle with them, as they are plastic (that is the way Toyota makes them).
B00FSDAY5K|5|Great Product at the right price.
B00I2JHNBK|5|Fit perfectly
B00C1YI2XA|5|Actually smaller than I expected, but nice quality of lights for the price I installed under the hood for a night repair, just in  case
B002GTKAHQ|5|Great product very well made
B00H7R2R28|1|They didn't right and got stuck in the ignition. And broke.
B000C8NV10|5|I accidently broke off my original one when I was trying to replace my cabin air filter so thats why I ordered this. It fits perfectly, great replacement.
B000FZ5GRC|5|Now the fog light color matches the headlights. These do put out more light than 9140 bulbs.
B000BGK25G|5|Exactly what we needed.
B000EVWDAK|5|Great tool to have around, and we got it at a fantastic price. Thank you Amazon, for another great deal!
B005JV7WXS|5|I've used Gforce products for years and now with Amazon the prices timely delivey my experience was great. Helmet is exactly as expected.
B00D9C2CDO|5|It work awesome! Fit perfect and zipper and straps durable! It poured on way down and nothing was wet! Easy to put on and off and folders compact to store!
B00651C998|5|Works great!  Never have had an issue with reception!!!
B009VOQ05U|5|Easy to assemble works perfect on my truck
B007TY06JA|5|The right hand side window regulator performs as expected.
B0018CP0BI|5|I was uncertain as to whether or not this thermocouple would work on my truck. When I checked the BD-Power website I could not find a part number for just this part of my BD X-Monitor for a 7.3 PSD.<br /><br />My thermocouples usually last a year to a year and a half. I expect the lifespan of this one will be similar. The vehicle is a Ford Excursion with a 12 valve Cummins pushing close 700 RWHP and 1,400 lb/ft. EGTs have always quickly climbed to the 1,400 degree range so my understanding is that heat eventually kills the probe.<br /><br />This part has bare wires at the end opposite the probe. I was concerned there would be issues connecting this to my X-Monitor based on previous phone calls with BD about using another brand. Tech support told me it was a gamble using any other brand because the length of the cables could alter readings. I was able to clamp female blade style connecting ends to these wires and it has performed flawlessly for the last couple months I've had it installed while towing and daily driving. No issues with accurate and responsive readouts whatsoever.<br /><br />It would be great if BD would make it easier to find and purchase replacement parts on their website but I prefer ordering through Amazon anyway. This purchase turned out to be a gamble worthwhile.
B00GQC4746|4|I'm a Nolan fan. Replaced an N90 with this. I love the look. I wear it exactly as the picture shows it all the time, I don't even bother with the various configuration options it provides. I'm sure they're useful to some people though. The chin bar *can* be removed and put back on while wearing the helmet, and yes, with it out, the helmet goes on more like a flip-up (read: easier).<br /><br />The unique draw with this helmet is the absolutely unprecedented visibility it provides. It is unlike any other helmet you've worn in this regard. The viewing range is so good, and so wide, it is *almost* like you're not wearing a helmet at all. The helmet is most quiet when it's in &#34;clean&#34; air. My particular windshield creates turbulence (As it did with my last helmet, I continue to play around with it's position). However, if I stand on the pegs to put my helmet above it, it is definitely smooth. The top vents do not provide any sort of airflow or cooling that you can actually fell. As another commenter saud, the faceshield vent near the chin does qork quite well, but it you're behind a tall windshield, it limits this. I have not used the helmet in cold weather yet, but the mouth/chin vent seems like it will provide enough airflow to clear up fogging around the pinlock insert. If it doesn't, like most helmets, the shield's first open position is low and will work fine for this.<br /><br />I'd check out the review on webbikeworld as well. It's sort of a game-changer...the visibility this thing provides.
B0006IX878|5|Order this every year.
B004I199O0|5|Fit perfectly. Looks exactly like the original. Easy to install.
B000CFFAQM|5|A breeze to install, and fit perfectly in my 97 Suburban.  Works perfectly.
B00B0RUQEC|5|Awesome ! So bright and easy to put in. Only took me about 5 minutes! A little more purple than I wanted but it's okay!
B00NLHNRVS|5|Perfect .. fast shipping
B00D3298A0|5|These mats look great and also keep the dirt, mud and anything else from getting into my cars rugs! Perfect gift for people who take good care of their car!! My fianc&eacute;e loved them!!!
B00JVIDPRC|4|The little white box it came in had holes in it and it was crushed so when opened the shipping package the fell right out and hit the ground
B0021R5KG4|5|Excellent
B00ONHQ4OM|5|Installed it myself. Working just fine. Thank you.
B003JZKXOQ|1|2001 gskr 600 didn't fix
B00ICKCUN0|5|I ordered the first one and loved it so much I ordered a second one. One for each car!  It came with instructions how to use. Thanks for a great product.  Hail Odin!
B003A8D6YG|5|Very good.
B00I3YCCWE|5|Works great.  There is a little leakage that is not a problem for me since I am using it to intermittently connect a garden hose to the kitchen sink to water plants on my deck.  Might not be the way to go if you want an always-on pressurized connection.<br /><br />No signs of corrosion after 3 months use with slightly chlorinated tap water.
B0091OE6K6|3|Slides around too much and hard to keep belt adjusted. It needs a way to grip the belt better. It did keep my belt off my neck on a long road trip.
B0073W7ZLA|5|great
B002VR5LLI|5|Works great. It gives me piece of mind when I leave my bike parked.
B000930N0U|5|I wish I can give 10 stars, this great product, added at night, next morning the steering system become very smooth, I have a leak from the side of the pump, I think I have to drive for 100 miles or 2days is gonna stop the leak, will update you.<br /><br />Thank you amazon, Thank you barsleak
B00U0R5R56|5|Fit perfect and look amazing, only had them for a  week or so but will update if they start to build condensation, looks great with the led bulbs (not included) you will however get two amber bulbs with the lenses
B00X4TX6EG|5|I run these babies on my 2000 chevy 3500. they are bright and as of the few months that ive had them, ive had no issues and great performance which really makes the price all that much better. I am ordering another set tonight for a rest-o-mod bike im doing
B0014H9572|5|As always with ACDelco OEM parts, this is a very well built water pump. Yes, it costs a lot more than the $50 Chinese one, but this pump should last well past 100,000 miles. A water pump is not a part to go cheap on. If the water pump breaks and you don't notice and stop your vehicle, you can destroy your engine in minutes from overheating. If you own a GM vehicle, always use ACDelco OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts. If the OEM part is not available, get the ACDelco Professional series part.<br /><br />My truck actually runs a few degrees cooler now than the old pump did when it was new. The old pump was not ACDelco and only lasted 65,000 miles. Very solidly built. Very quiet pump. Perfect fit for my 1996 C1500 Chevy truck. If you're not experienced with working on vehicles, expect this to take upwards of two hours to replace. No special tools needed. Don't forget to scrape the engine surface where the gasket rests against the engine to remove all traces of the old gasket and then clean it with a solvent like brake cleaner. Wait a bit for everything to dry. Also, don't forget a tube of RTV water pump sealant (type 22071 in Amazon). Rub just enough to barely coat the gasket on both sides, press against the pump, and then press the pump to the engine. This will form a stronger seal than the gasket by itself. Also, new pump bolts with thread sealant on them is good insurance for $10. My truck uses Dorman 902-804.<br /><br />Another thing, as long as you've got the system drained of fluid this is a good time to replace the hoses if they're old (ACDelco about $40 for both). If the thermostat is old, a new ACDelco one is about $10-15. Old radiator caps can leak, about $10 for the ACDelco one.
B000FP9WMW|4|Would like multiple holes to be able to change the amount of extension from the rear of the vehicle
B000HDIOX0|4|could have been packaged a bit more solidly, but worked great.
B0012TYNY2|4|It keep my batteries going.
B009DJVDIM|5|looks good on my auto.
B003U4O414|5|Have used this in several cars and I've never seen it fail to quiet an engine considerably. Used with a premium synthetic oil like Red Line, Liquimoly, Motul, you can't get any better protection and proper lubrication. Works quickly but gets better over the first 20-30 miles or so. The price is right too. I've used several liquimoly products over the years and they always do what they say they will. It will darken your oil some and if you get it on your clothes you'll not be getting out.
B00A93T9D2|5|My wife found it to be very cute for a Keychain. Its very well made
B001RZ64ZM|5|Looks awesome on my hog, easy installation :)
B00480N154|5|Awesome brightness and color not hid of course but defintlty more bright and white than stock halogen
B00C7Y02E6|1|Garbage  it's so plastic  don't buy this
B00GHS5P9A|4|Easy install.
B00979OE66|5|I bought the gloves for riding motorcycle and I really love it. I recommend this one and the skull mask and a graphic helmet if you are a hot biker (Y)
B006OQ35GU|5|Nice product
B000BO8Z9I|4|works good
B00VELE71W|4|Good led bar it just had scratches on the glass so just watch out on your order but all the light bulbs work perfect
B0079508K6|5|Works great
B001EP0GTK|5|It fit perfectly and only took 10 min. to install with car on a lift. Did not need to drop exhaust as some said I would.
B004D0HNUS|5|Arrived very fast. Installed easy. Started up with out a problem.
B00M3L159Y|5|Grate fit
B004P5CM0C|2|Too small
B006GWVBQ8|5|Great!
B000C55LV6|5|Item as described
B00E5OUOCQ|4|It looks good and does it's job but it's my fault for thinking that my tiny Honda Civic wouldn't need the larger size.<br /><br />Beware that if you fold it up without the case and forget about it. It might just pop out and surprise you!
B00JK327VS|4|Work well for my uses. I have a 2001 Dodge Dakota and I got these to throw into the tool box. The cables and clamps seem to be of good quality, but the bag could have been built a tad better. I actually just took them out of the bag and threw them in the box anyway so that is not a concern to me.<br /><br />I did get a chance to test them out helping an older lady at the gas station and they performed flawlessly.
B00KC2HSP6|5|It's very nice
B00QGJGP5I|5|Happy with product
B00HS8X53Q|1|I had them on the bike for a week and the glass (plastic) fell out on the street. worthless junk.
B001XUD46S|5|Works as advertised. Easy install.
B002SSEUUI|1|THIS ORDER SAID AND MOTOR ON THE END IF THE DESCRIPTION AND THERE WAS NOT A MOTOR AND THAT IS WHAT I NEED.
B00DLMN2P4|1|Bad quality product I had a problem with the original one and the replacements never matched the color i had. I am tired of waiting for the rigth one. Better not to buy the product i DONT RECOMMEND THEM
B007MUY8U4|5|GREAT PRODUCT WRONG SIZE
B000V2R7KI|5|Work great!  This thing is beefy, great construction and handles the 50 Amp well.  Not much more to say - buy it.
B00HNKYD0I|2|Texas heat will totally melt the glue. It runs down and forms a glob at the bottom of the door frame. Lost 3 of the 4 on a 200 mike drive. Now nothing but a glue streak on the doors... Works well if temperature is below 70deg.
B0031I5Z80|5|Good rotors
B00C4ZCTT4|5|Product is great quality for the price. If you told me this was OEM, I would believe you. Swapped them out, and it took all of 30 seconds. They look so much better than the stock's closed Honeycomb. I hit a speed bump a bit too hard and my stock cover flew off, so I was incredibly thankful to find a replacement that was both cheaper and better looking.<br /><br />10/10 - Highly recommend.
B00KQ7WDZW|5|Excellent Quality! I was surprised as how rugged it is. Lots of loops and straps to store it or carry it easily. Holds a good amount of cargo as well. Spacious, Durable, Nice looking. Replaced my big bulky plastic bin perfectly!
B00LT0S28C|5|GOOD DEAL !!!
B00Y3H1VB8|5|Really nice jacks and super easy to install
B00EC2D2T8|4|Adjustable rubber straps, works for me.
B0012DPTAK|4|Fits fine, a little difficulty putting on and taking off. But I have ALS and that does not help putting it in
B001PY2DU0|5|Worked perfectly.
B00PWRSO4K|5|Looks exactly as it does in the picture looks great.
B007P05FBW|5|Makes life easier on the tailgate. Good price and Amazon Prime is the only way to go.
B006P7LBFK|3|It's cheaply made and priced.  It works for me because I need a vacuum pump about once every three years.  When the pump arrived, the box was soaked in oil.  I added the oil from the bottle that came with the pump and used the pump while the oil was dripping out of the drain hole.  The oil in the unit drained out no matter what I did to stop the leak.  I tried replacing O-rings and even tried &#34;non-hardening&#34; gasket material.  Finally after frustration with seeing oil contamination on my storage shelf I looked earnestly for the source of the leak.  I found the vacuum oil drain hole recess was broken inside the housing.  A crack in the case at a stress point and almost undetectable but sufficient to drip oil.  I decided to drain the unit completely and put it back on the shelf.  When I need it again I will fill it up, use it while watching it leak, then drain it and put it away again.  You get what you pay for.  In this case it was the cheapest vacuum pump I could find that had decent ratings.  So I decided I can live with buying vacuum pump oil once every three years.
B007SX1IYO|3|Holes were too small for the mountings straps so I had to file the holes. Wiring was easy but no instructions are included
B00YI3IGA6|5|Easy to install and provides great sun protection!
B000WJF2KM|4|Fit as advertised, working well.
B002LLJ8UY|5|Yes I'm fresh
B00EVPM0LC|5|Very durable tool
B007BS0G26|4|Great seal, but color starts to fade after a year or so due to weather exposure.
B00DZ34IXY|3|My boyfriend loves these except every time he's wearing them we can't cuddle or anything because my hair or even clothes get caught on the little prongs
B00HRZVC6W|5|Great mats, just less than a custom fit weathertech liner for much less and few hundreds less than $325 that is a dealer add on option, we all know dealers rip off
B000KKD2YQ|5|as promised
B00KLKC20K|2|Looks great and worked well but the battery didn't fit right into the back cover ..it has since cracked due to the stress
B001FANRLS|4|Some of the straps are short so you'll have to work it to connect the straps under the seats. Overall, great though.
B00DNXGUCS|4|The clutch lever is more complex than stock which causes it to move vertically if not tightened down. Yet, when too tight it can put unnecessary resistance on the clutch cable.<br /><br />Second is not a problem, but very important. Make sure you turn the gold cylinder piece in the brake lever to fit. There are instructions attached by business card for this so I'd take a very good look at it.
B001O2W22C|4|The tools were exactly what I odered. And came in a timely manner.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great!
B001KSCEXW|5|This was very reasonably priced and very easy to install. My husband had it on in about 5 minutes.
B0015C8HT8|5|used to hold down tarps. I use it for wrapping up my toolbox since the plastic latch broke. I also use it for my dolly when moving small stuff. seems to have a lot of possible uses. strong, good quality.
B00FC7T3JU|5|Great jacket, fits snug. A bit heavy/hot on summer days. But i love it
B001P5O4XI|2|drive gear locked in up position  contacted discount starter they said that was normal order new srarter else wear  took loss on this one
B00LXJTMRY|5|love this. I've been getting plenty of compliments from people about this & others want to buy it
B003A8D6YG|4|works extremely well.  It can be washed.  Does collect dust very easily
B00KTHSCRC|5|Great key fobs. They work extremely well for my 2000 Buick Park Avenue.
B0006ODWE6|5|Sounds great. Fast delivery! Clean look in engine bay. Very happy. Wife's escalade, she likes the rumble under the hood.

B00IU5V6LO|4|nice
B00HJAMBI8|4|It works.
B00GBVHPNW|5|These gloves are a great deal. The vents built in to each finger really keeps your hands from getting sweaty. Makes for a comfortable ride and look great too.
B00BI1EA7O|5|Super easy to use, super accurate! Very happy with it. I'm using it on my 2012 Vstrom 650. To install it I didn't have to disassemble anything. Speed sensor connection is on the left side right above the counter sprocket. Just reach in with your fingers and you'll find the wires right there. I hope this helps.
B0030V6XW0|5|Incredible! We have many fixtures in our new house that weren't maintained properly and were badly stained from years of hard water. I was skeptical but based on the good reviews decided to give this product a try. I applied as directed and was expecting to have to put in some serious elbow grease to &#34;buff&#34; away the spots. When I went back to buff I was shocked at how little effort it took to clean the product off and to my surprise the fixtures looked like new! Not sure what magical ingredients they put in this, but it works! Guess I don't have to go shopping for new bathroom fixtures!
B00KRIKRM6|5|works great
B00NHXXQJY|5|Fit perfectly!!!
B00HPLRQZ4|5|Item delivered on time, was as described and a very nice product, packed good would rate A+ all the way !
B0062IJP32|5|Hope that it fits
B00BMPEN7S|5|great product
B000C55UZ8|5|These preserved the original ride height. I was a little worried about that. The progression rate is good too. some progressive springs can be suddenly harsh but these aren't. Handling is still just like it used to be with the IPD swaybarss I have. I would buy again.
B000C5HK88|3|Did not click down tightly.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This was worth the $. Replaced an old one that I don't remember the brand but it was quality. This seemed less quality but actually is more durable. Fit sleeping bags, bags etc. Very spacious and protects everything inside well.
B000C9QNG4|4|2006 Pontiac Torrent: Drive side window stopped working due to the motor dying, this was the exact part and it fit perfectly....Also very easy to change it out.
B008CPUGMW|1|They were different than the door speaker jack. My advice, if you are putting these in a 1999 f250 pull a speaker first. The advice on what fits is not always correct.
B004QNW09Q|4|Fit perfect but paint matching interior isn't the easiest.
B00DJ3PDTI|5|evrything seems to be just fine.
B003UM9GDM|5|Excellent jack for the money. Very stable and easy to assemble.
B0064OOE3A|1|Never worked!!!!!
B00I9TML24|2|They were dim one came damaged you can tell as soon as you get them their cheap. Their not as bright as the picture makes out to be. But for the price their ok
B009NMMHNE|1|Steer clear of this one.  Get a real tune, one designed for your car.  This is designed for diesel trucks, not a sophisticated modern European diesel.
B00HDERBLC|1|First time i used it , started smoking and quit ! Do not  think its a quality piece . Less than 20 days old and worthless ! Someone  needs to contact me about replacement or refund cause i can not recommend this product  at all !. . Not happy
B010M7NQ4C|4|Very good for the price.
B00265M9SS|1|I'm returning it for two reasons that both are part of the design and the bad quality:<br />1. none of the adapters properly seals brake bleeding screws. they draw air and barely any liquid. I'm aware that the screw threads will draw some air when cracked. But even before loosening the bleeder screw it will draw a lot of air and lose vacuum through the adapter (when screw is still tight). It was quite a pain to pump 95% air.<br />2. After I painfully bled 2 brakes, the pump fell apart. that little steel splint fell out and there was no way to reinstall it permanently. Admittedly, since the adapters don't really fit, 2 pumping two brakes probably wore out the pump like bleeding 20 brakes....<br />3. That container is quite small and re-inserting the cap requires careful alignment to make it seal properly. A larger container (with larger bottom so it doesn't tip over) would help a lot. but that is kind of moot since the adapters are not tight anyway....<br /><br />I bought this for $10 more than similar looking off-brand vacuum sets hoping I get better adapters. but i might as well have bought a cheaper set that doesn't' work right. There literally is no way the cheaper off-brand kits could have been worse. I  realize it is not very expensive and could live with some shortcoming. but this really made me think to either get pressure bleeding kit, or take the car to the shop sound like good ideas.
B001V3959W|4|A little flimsy compared to my other KD's.
B00GYTEBVU|5|The build quality of the filter is excellent. It fits perfectly in 2009 Kia Optima.
B000C9PXGU|5|Good product and it is what i needed.
B00JK322MW|5|I purchased the 16ft. cables at a reduced price for my review. Upon arrival the package looks a little beat up. However there was no structural damage to the jumper cables. The 16 ft cable serves my needs well and I have had no issues with them.
B000CPCOAM|1|I purchased these speed bleeders (639560) for the front brakes on my 2005 Toyota Tundra.  The first set that was sent had the wrong numbers on the package.  I think they were labeled 639570.  I exchanged them for the correct size 639560 (at least that's what the package label says) which the Russell site indicates is the correct size for my truck.  Well, I finally got around to bleeding my front brakes today after a busy schedule over the past month.  I noticed that the size of the bleeder nipple is much larger on these that I received that what is on my truck.  And the width of the screw pattern is much too wide.  It became obvious that these are not the correct size for my truck.  After closer examination, the package says that the 639560 are 10mm X 1.0.  A 10mm wrench will not fit these bleeders.  These appear to be 11mm X 1.5.  The photo of these and on the Russell site indicates that the bleeders for 639560 have red sealant around the threads.  These mis-packaged bleeders have black sealant.  And, of course, I bought these on 05-Jul-2015, so I'm unable to exchange them now since I'm outside the 30 day window.  What a waste of time and money on two packages that I received that were both wrong.
B00NLG4Q2I|5|Beautiful
B00A9AN42C|4|Good grille
B00OH49W22|4|Works great. Not as Bright as I thought, but it gets the job done.
B000BZEHZ8|5|Just what I needed to fix the check engine light.
B00TA5ECJQ|1|The term siphon used in the description is misleading. This product is a nice idea but common with many products nowadays it goes on the market without an attempt to see if it works. I never could get it to siphon as I couldn't get rid of the air in the bulb to create a vacuum.  It does work well as a pump if you don't mind getting an ounce or so with each squeeze. Lawn mowers and such would be fine but emptying a car tank would be time consuming. Waste of money for me anyway.
B006FUT0CS|4|This stuff is identical to Mrguiar's D115, which is a concentrated version of this they offer in their detailers line. While this is considerably more expensive than D115. D115's only sold in gallons and you won't find it at B&M stores. This stuff works very well, I know the bottle says 2 towels, but no, unless the car's already very clean. I use a lot more towels. Depending on the size and dirtiness level I might use 12. I also use very high quality towels. Amazon sells the Edgeless Eagle's from TheRagCompany. If you search Eagle Edgeless on here you'll find them. They're not cheap, but they're amazingly soft and have the perfect nap imho for a product like this.  They're sold as 5 packs, which should be enough for a regular car.   fold my towels in 4's so I have 8 usable sides per towels. 16x16 imho is the best size towel.  If you're skeptical about a waterless car wash product, don't be. Used properly this stuff's outstanding, I honestly prefer it over my old hose + 2 bucket method. I'm anal about washing my car and absolutely love a good waterless product. Meguiars is one of those companies that delivers top tier products. This one's a keeper. Buy it + some high quality MF towels and you'll become converted.  Suggestion: DON'T use cheap Walmart MF towels, this product's only as good as your technique and the quality of the towels you use. If you rush it and only use 2 janky made in China towels you probably won't like this product at all.
B00HMRDPBK|5|This is a great after market replacement for the price.
B007TYJCJA|5|It came before due date and a perfect fit. Definitely would recommend.
B000UHH60A|5|worked very well in my race trailer
B00B8TZ1O2|5|coooool
B000CIS4IU|3|As my previous one went bad, I just got another one as all my mounting position and lines where already there
B007HUGX2U|5|great
B007Y86UNM|5|Great part Cheapest I could find and got here really fast and back to work thank
B00QKXCNPG|3|The stickers were permanent, exterior decals, my &#34;search&#34; was for cling style decals that could be applied to the inside of my car window and thus removed/ reapplied as needed.  So, I was a bit surprised when they came in to see that was not the case...that said, I did apply them anyway, and they are good quality vinyl decals, no complaints about the way they look!
B0013Y0VOC|5|Bags as expected. Quality materials, perfect fit in panniers, but it is a Kawasaki product, designed for these bikes.<br />Surprised at speed of shipping. Very pleased with purchase.
B000C935V0|5|Excellent
B003IS3HV0|5|This stuff is awesome. So far, I've used it twice on my cut, once on my jacket, once on my boots, and once on another jacket. The bottle is still more than three quarters full. It does a great job on the leather.
B00A1K779G|4|The key chain is very nice and much heavier than I expected.  Yes, the ring is not really made for Saabs with the fat key FOB, however, a thinner chrome ring attached to the key or a key clasp will do the trick.  It is definitely something that likely had a $20-25 sticker back in the day.
B00JEXODKW|1|Will not power on. Ask for a replacement or a refund and was refused.
B00ZKTXCRO|5|Very bright and clear. Much brighter than the standard bulb that comes with older cars. Can also be used as low voltage lighting in a closet, or just about anywhere you can get 12v to.
B00B9GQ6ZM|5|I installed these on a 2014 Equinox and they look and function great but install can be a little tricky because you have to place them on the chrome around the window frame and there needs to be a gap on the top so trying to install them straight can be a challenge. Other than that all of my trucks have the GM shades and the look great. I like it when I can crack the windows in the rain or leave them open on a hot day to vent the interior.
B00RW7XE8E|5|I installed these wipers on a Saturn 1995. They were super easy to install, took less than a minute. My first impression was they appeared to be made very well. I used them and they were excellent. I was surprised how they squeegeed the window so clean, they didn't smear or make a noise. They appear to hug the window with slight pressure to give a clean and clear swipe. Would recommend to family and friends!
B007ZGKKMA|5|It's bright
B00FCAS316|5|Great service. Fun product.
B00ZVHOOVI|4|Tool quality is good, but there are a few short falls. First if you use this tool on a Range Rover you must purchase a separate TDC locking pin. Second, the cam locking bars are not labeled and are unique to their particular camshaft. Third, the vanos alignment tool's indexing pins were not securely installed in the tool, so one fell out, fortunately not into the engine. Fourth, the kit does not include the cam locking bar's hold down. This simple but vital tool screws into the spark plug hole and holds down the locking bars during alignment, tightening and loosening cam sprockets. I made one but I have a full shop with welders and machine tools, Most people would need to inquire more about this part. Fifth, Absolutely no instructions or help contact number. Had to go online and track down an email contact, person did reply promptly, and helped me identify cam bars. Lastly this is not a job for a novice mechanic, this is a complicated and laborious job to service these components.
B00GKLGFU2|5|just install this airaid intake for my 2013 ecoboost today. good product ya. i can feel lil more power and its quiet. dont know about the fuel milage yet. will try it out later. one thing im scare of is that dont know if this filter can block the water while driving in heavy rain. u know the hood is not 100% sealed huh?
B00386Z1PM|5|awesome
B00PWXJTNO|4|Vehicle Installed:  2015 Jeep Wrangler (JK) 2-door w/ [[ASIN:B00OWS4O30 Bestop 54852-17 Trektop Pro Hybrid Soft Top for JK 2-door]].<br /><br />My wife and I were looking for a way to create a secure storage compartment both large enough to protect travel items like suit- and briefcases for when we travel and want to leave them in the vehicle while we make brief excursions.  I also wanted something fairly easy to remove and which didn't require additional drilling (I'd rather not permanently alter a vehicle for an item I may or may not use long-term.)  There were other options that involved slide-out, locking drawers but I felt the capacity was diminished and the installation more difficult to remove for times I wanted to haul, say, my dogs. The Tuffy Security Deck Enclosure fit the bill quite nicely.<br /><br />The material is a relatively thin, though not insubstantial, sheet metal that bolts quite securely to brackets along the frame.  It takes a bit of work to align the shelf so that it sits fairly level and the gaskets along the sides, especially towards the rear of the vehicle, are very snug making it just that much more difficult to get it level.  Even with effort, I was only able to get it &#34;mostly level&#34; (kinda like &#34;mostly dead&#34; in The Princess Bride) but it looks pretty darned slick when finished.<br /><br />At the time I purchased the security enclosure, I also purchased (linked above) the Trektop Pro Soft-Top from Bestop.  It's a terrific soft top, but as others have mentioned it presents a minor problem with the security enclosure.  The Trektop has pistons for the lift-gate that interfere with the ability to lift the lid of the security enclosure.  To me, that's not a big deal because--frankly--the lift top is a bit wonky and I'd rarely bother using it.  It's easy enough to just slide things in and out with the tailgate open.  Others, however, who want quick access to the items in the compartment without opening the gate might want to avoid the Trektop or, if they already have it, consider one of the slide-out storage compartments from Tuffy or Smittybilt.  One nice side-effect that others have mentioned is that in my 2-door Wrangler, rear seats removed, there is a nice gap between the front seats and the compartment where I can store the bag for my Trektop Pro windows and the soft top, making the two pretty nicely complementary.<br /><br />The bare-metal enclosure looks pretty nice, with a slightly rough texture, but if you want a nice look do what others have mentioned and buy the Tuffy Black Diamond Plate Rubber Mat (part #864-01-275) for about $60 and cut it to size.  It looks pretty darned nice.<br /><br />I rated this product only four stars, however, because during installation and much to my chagrin I found that five bolts (5/16&#34; x 1&#34;) were missing from the sealed envelope they were contained in, making me think it was a QC issue and not damage to the package.  For a product that costs the amount this does it's extremely annoying to have to run to the hardware store for $5 worth of parts that could have been included with a little more attention to detail.  I've bought plenty of cheap IKEA furniture--don't judge me!--that hasn't had this many missing items. I'd also ding it slightly for instructions that were fair, but that sometimes lacked the visual detail to make the process obvious.  (Everything went together well, but I had a few moments that I resembled less a man and more a curious monkey with a puzzled look and lots of noggin-scratching.)<br /><br />All in all, if what you want is a large, secure enclosure that's easy to install and that doesn't require vehicle modification, I'd say the Tuffy is an excellent choice.  (Just check the parts before you begin the installation!)
B00R8LANZG|5|Arrived early and fit perfectly
B007SMR902|4|Installed in my trailer, they work well.
B00BMWEITO|5|Perfect
B003ZA8WIE|4|Sturdy ramps for my 2015 Prius IV. They do however scape under the fender a bit but do not damage where it is noticeable.
B00K1C1WC2|3|Bought these for our travel trailer. Using them with a 14&#34; standard size travel trailer wheel/ tire. These do not fit snug against the tires at all. There is only a small portion that actually touch the tire. It would probably stop the tire from rolling if it had to, but does nothing to stop the rolling back and forth when walking around inside the trailer.
B002KG9A5I|5|excellent
B003SJJRMC|2|These springs squeak like crazy. Make sure you grease them properly. I had them installed at a shop and they won't stop squeaking even though I've repeatedly greased them. My OE parts never squeaked!
B007VRALJA|4|Great H-pipe kit! Only, I was going to install myself but the 'H' section did not have one side expanded so that it'll slip in to form the H. Sure, you can go to a muffler shop or rent and/or buy a pipe expander but i think it should already come expanded on one of the 'T' sections so that you may diy; if not then why provide clamps.lol I went to a shop and had them do it and might as well had them weld it on.
B000VB102K|4|Yes it got me back on the road.  So far so good
B00XKY89AG|2|slides around  in trunk
B00CO72FOQ|4|Very good fit for my vehicle, not too hard to handle when removing it from dash.  Keeps my car cooler than my last vehicle, but I had a sun roof that may have been the reason, not so with my new car.  Very happy indeed
B00XV78998|5|this fluid cap is as describe and it really looks good on my bike
B00U868BN4|2|I don't see any noticeable improvements.  Maybe this thing would work better if placed by an air vent.
B00GJ1D5SI|5|Works great..had a little trouble putting in but got it!
B00MD0FW7G|5|When this came in the mail my wife got mad...so far great
B0045K2Q9Y|5|A good assortment of mini car fuses.  They appear to working just as well as the name brand fuses.  The cost is very reasonable.
B005YP38EQ|5|Worked Perfect
B000IZ4AD0|5|Great Product. Arrived on time,was as described. Fit my car perfectly. I wil use this seller again any time I need a car part replacement.
B00IOSDSJA|5|Excellent handles
B005UJ9ZGQ|5|Worth the cost if you want quality --- and gorgeous.  I had lesser frames and over not a lot of time they showed it.
B002P8P5O6|5|Perfect for for my 2002 Chrysler Sebring 2door. Had it the next day. Thank you
B00GPUIZ42|2|Description not detailed enough. Thought it was an adhesive decal, but it was a window static stick one.
B00K75UFWQ|5|This is the best car cover I have found!  Good product....good price...Fits my Nissan Versa perfectly!
B010MHV00O|5|I was surprised to receive personalized communication from Bottle Pro almost immediately after placing my order. It arrived quickly and worked exactly as described and set up could not have been any easier. I replied to Bottle Pro with my feedback as requested and got a very quick response thanking me personally for my feedback. I am sure you will be rewarded much success for your stellar business practices. Thank you
B00J8UQAOI|5|the best towels for cleaning windows that I have every used.
B001JT0CGI|5|I was able to run this wire from the back of the vehicle to the center console and still had a lot left over.  This is a great way to temporarily wire up a radio and antenna for a trip so that it can easily be removed after the trip.  The wire is not too stiff, so I was able to mold it into some of the weatherstripping to clear the door seal.
B00F5MUB66|5|Great shower head, replaced our travel trailer shower head with this.  It works great no issues as of yet (20 showers).  Installation was simple
B00KWQRC4O|5|Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You'll be so glad you did:-)
B007HROBOU|5|Good quality cover, keeps the weather off the top of the jack.
B009LL65V2|5|good product
B000630240|4|Easy installation, and sounds loud, love that you can press the button to lower the alarm setting, would have been better if it came with 2 remotes .
B002N5W8Q4|5|Worked flawlessly on our first 12 day vacation.  I think it helps on circulating the air inside the refrigerator to even out the temperature.
B005K8E9FY|5|Worked very well.
B005FIUMOG|5|When I first received this item, I was very impressed, I live in the Chicago area so over the winter I had to keep it in the store charge mode, since then, nothing but problems. I cannot keep a charge on it, it won't charge at all, just continues to flash both yellow and green and no charge. Here you cannot ride in the winter so now I'm past the return timeframe. I won't try this again, back to the heavy, hard HD battery for my Harley Fatboy. I had good hopes, but now I'm only disappointed...  Incredible power, starts my Fatboy with plenty of power and on the first turn... Skeptical, at first, but no more, this is the real thing!!
B00I49114I|5|Excellent product Nd transaction.
B0009IQXJ0|4|Used a sponge to apply at first, took 10 years. Later switched to 2 pieces of brawny/bounty paper towels to apply = easy, fast, and accurate + no need to worry where to store the dirty sponge/applicator.<br /><br />Wear gloves or your hand will be a mess if you touch it.<br /><br />Not bad, seems like it stays on it pretty well so far, did the job. Doesn't need a lot to finish the tire.<br /><br />always good to clean the tire first<br /><br />no sling issue at all
B0028OE96C|5|Very nice, protective end caps.
B00M8L5LK8|5|These are a must have, bought two sets, they are nice fit and not to diff to install, highly recommended
B00QG3GP68|5|Good quality plush microfibers!  Used and washed mine repeatedly and still in excellent condition!
B004RJI2AU|5|Love this cover!
B0002NIFW0|5|Awesome reflective Harley plate!
B009X1X78O|2|The spark plug cap was faulty. Had to end up removing the new cap and replacing with the old cap as it just screws onto the plug wire. A continuity check between the screw where the wire attaches and the socket where the spark plug goes in read O/L. Haven't dissected yet but I plan to one weekend and I'll update what I found.
B0007UAXJQ|5|Works perfectly with the paint.
B008L59GYC|4|a big improvement over existing antenna
B00BCRMBSO|1|cheap.  Not easy to install.  Seat pad does not stay well.
B000A8MQCW|4|nice, watch out you can put it together backwards.
B004P887C6|1|Used it TWICE and it completely fell apart!! Used it so long after purchase that it was ineligible for return!!! Horrible!!!
B0090DXBEK|5|Worked like a champ thank you
B000ECSA2E|5|sound and look good
B00BCRMC1U|2|Update- I got the covers on but I didn't receive all the parts to hook them in place so I had to use carabiners. They don't fit right and I have no idea if they'd fit better with all the parts. The directions I received were for a one piece set up where I ordered and was sent covers that were separate parts. (The seat back is one, the butterms part is another) They've been on a week and I don't drive daily but there are already holes. My digs haven't even been on them yet so I'm fairly certain the back seat cover will have issues. BUT my booty and thighs aren't being burned now so 2 stars. My husband is now shopping around for something sturdier because my car will be the one that the dogs ride in. I included a picture of a small portion of the seam failures but just know that happened and the covers are loose on my seats. Live and learn.<br /><br />I would give a higher score if the instructions I received with it were the correct directions so I'm not sure how it'll look just yet. Right now I'm in the middle of the road. Once I figure them out I might change my review.
B00HQLLJ4C|5|Looks great on my Gsx-R 750
B000BZID8U|1|After one month pump failed. $450 in labor charges and now im told pump is defective. Im pissed....they have the nurves to charge me a restocking fee of $19...I don't think so
B004P49QUC|5|Good product - happy with this purchase.
B001DRP9E6|5|Perfect fit AC is running cool and no longer feels bogged down. Great price and Mann products always delivery per quality.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Great product at a nice price would recommend this chocks.
B00DLS61J2|5|I am a tint noon and was cautiously optimistic. No reason to be, comes with everything you need: hard card, gasket wrench, &#34;conquistador&#34;, dryer sheet, little bottle of neutral Sophomore additive, even lint free tissue to clean the gaskets. All pieces fit exactly. My car is black and this film at 35% does, in fact, work to cool the interior. If I ever get another car I will be purchasing again.
B00HZOBP9E|4|These are nice mats - however I would prefer that it covered the center floorboard in the front.  This area is particularly vulnerable to spills.
B00ZVJ2YFY|3|Fits great my honda civic. It has a strong packaging smell
B00F8TT040|5|Durable metal material that will not rust. And so far the colors of the Italian flag have not faded from the sun. Been on my suv for several months. Still holding up.
B00E1M220E|4|These fit nicely and reduce the effort for me to grab on the tank to prevent sliding forward. But, for some reason, I am thinking that I should have go with the snake skin version. Anyway, I am happy with these. One thing to note is that the center tank protector does not stick on the tank very well, because the 2012 M796's center tank strip is matted finish. I then used a scissor to cut off small tingle-shape off the strip on both sides and that helped a lot.
B00062Z4M6|5|This shifter knob is very high quality and looks great. I should have purchased the white knob, though. This knob gets HOT after a short time in the sun.
B005RQ6OM0|5|Worked perfectly.  Nice action, nice weight and size.
B00757KJTI|5|The stubby antenna is awesome, low profile an ergonomic! Fast shipping an product was as described.
B00K7KVLDI|5|Beautiful... large ... Perfect for any wall .. Great investment ..be aware comes in for pieces you assemble on wall .. Requires patience . But easy to do ... Great product
B0018EVH54|5|I had a Scorpio alarm on my Harley and it did everything that this one does; with the exception of the hands free arming and disarming. I had to manually arm and disarm the alarm with the older version. However, I am quite sure this one will meet or exceed my expectations because I am a Scorpio fan and groupie.
B0070Y35OC|5|I will definitely be a repeat customer. Great tint kit & easy to use/install & awesome price!
B006O0H9PO|5|easy to install. I bought 2 sets just to have a backup when the rubber wares out. I like
B00348B6TY|5|I got this as a gift for my wife to put on her car so it would be easier to spot in parking lots. She loves it! it went on really easy and has help up great to the weather.
B000FGI5BU|5|Nice
B007GREKVK|5|Love the handlebar!! Was very expensive importing it into India but absolutely worth it! The comfort combined with killer looks makes this bar a winner!
B0000AXQU2|1|Great idea but poor quality parts.  The container burst from the pressure of a regular garden hose.  All the plastic parts leak.  It seemed good on the first use but once you disconnect and reconnect the leaks start.  Most of the posts from 1 time users are higher because they have only used it once.
B00YC72GHC|3|The frame is perfect and very feminine. I love my purchase and they were delivered packaged jus like u said but I am mad because I did not receive my gift set. It was suppose to come with the blinged out stylus pen and and blinged out name tag and I did not receive it
B00757KJTI|5|Perfect fit...great look to.
B003NV3A5U|5|Fits like a charm, nice quality, fast delivery.
B00DJDYSBC|5|Thanks, the quality and the price were very reasonable.
B00H874CMA|5|A Camaro SS should not be sold with out the Strut Tower Brace. Tightens up the steering and stops the car from pulling or drifting after you hit a dip in the road especially on 20in wheels.
B005EMGXUA|5|Someone told me not to buy this but I glad i bit save so much money thank that I have a mind of my own
B00I2I104C|5|I can't say how long they will last but I can see in my 2012 Jeep JKU now!  The bulbs all fit and worked perfectly, the instructions are easy to follow and everything was done in a matter of minutes!  Very happy with these.
B00ASN7XG8|5|Love her so much. Perfect!!!
B00KYU719O|5|Miracle paint. I did several badges on my 2014 Evo and covered all the rims. It's been over a year and it's holding up perfectly. I bumped a curb a few days ago which scratched off the plastidip and scratched my wheel. I went home and painted over top of it with some plasti dip and you can't even tell it happened. Awesome stuff.
B0002SR2RY|4|this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements
B0082ACC6U|5|Good price, easy install, great fit, good looks.
B00G08Y9JO|5|650i fit perfect
B008I2OZK8|5|Love how it hides/removes small scratches.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|Being using it for several car wash now. It does the job of drying and not feeling the towel is really wet. Most of the towel I bought at store does not provide the same quality as this one. The only issue I had was some blue piece dropping. Other than that, everything is good. I received this item in discount in exchange of my honest review.
B00CGGXRK6|5|Ordered this for a vacation road trip from Texas to Alabama and it worked like a champ on my 2014 GMC 1500 short-bed. Took a little longer than promised to install, but overall not that difficult. Would definitely recommend this item if you're looking for a cost-effective way to keep rain and elements off any items in your bed.
B00K0AVUO0|5|Sent this as a gift to my mom. The one she had was stolen from her car. She was excited when this one was delivered to her.
B004HCOE72|5|This worked great and I have used the &#34;3 letter&#34; brand before with poor results. This kit was perfect and cleaned up my daughters very yellowed and hazy headlights with ease and in a short time. Great Product at the right price.
B00X6F5X08|2|There is gap between led lights and plastic fog cover
B004M8L4HY|5|I used four of these to replace the standard incandescent fixtures that came with our camper.  The light is incredibly bright and I was able to place them in the same spot as the original fixtures.  They dramatically brighten our camper and extend the life of our dry camping batteries.
B00LNOUMOG|3|For the price it does the job. Easy to put together without factory rail. Did add my old brackets from my old cover/truck. Just in case. If you want something nicer spend more money. You get what you pay for.
B00FEAOG38|5|I love the graphic. High quality build. Light weight. I highly recommend this one
B00UZVJWIA|1|I thought I was purchasing an after market sensor, that would work, however I did not realize that the &#34;BA &#34; at the end of the serial number did not match what I was looking for, I need a &#34;BC&#34; at the end of the number.<br />Hope you can find one for me without cost a hundred dollars plus EACH!<br />Please advise, Frank
B00O84WNNG|5|Excellent charger just plug in and walk away. Thank you
B0031ZDU62|5|I appreciate the time taken to insure we are always thought of and feel the security that Amazon.com provides.
B00JY07PRI|1|they will work for about two weeks and will start going out
B005WLC334|5|Good
B001ILOE8Y|4|The Tie Rod is the proper fit for my 2008 f250 4wd. So far it has held up well. I have been told to use Moog due to reliability. They are built much better than the original equipment take-off.
B00ESNC81Y|1|Rearview mirrors switch doesn't work.
B005GHU9QM|5|Looks great! and functional to keep debris from the radiator!
B00KLKTUI2|5|I had an issue with a part on the carburetor and Zoom Zoom parts where more then helpful. They sent me a new part right away.
B008CFTL64|5|works very good
B002GYSQ7M|5|Works as advertised, fast delivery
B00OH0S5Y2|5|These bulbs fit well to replace numerous bulbs throughout the car's interior.  It was a great upgrade in the light and appearance.
B007UTNU38|5|Very quiet put these on my big boy expedition shhhh not a sound
B008B5X5GC|2|Muy bueno
B00MG9D1G8|4|This clamped worked great with a LED light bar on a 1&#34; pipe. I had to use a combination of the inserts to get it the light to stay in place but it worked well. The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star rating is it was advertised it came with an allen wrench to tighten it and it was not included
B0001CMUV4|4|Works very well and kept cargo carrier from swaying at all. I would highly recommend it, although I think the price is too steep (which is why only 4 stars).
B0007UQ2N2|5|Although this hose is one of the smallest in diameter that I own, I consistently use this over others. This hose holds it's shape well and doesn't kink. I wish it was a little longer, but I knew that when I purchased. Also, you can't beat the price as always with Amazon.
B00JSSZBDQ|5|Quiet operation. Easy installation. I am glad to have installed the part.
B003U8ZZ2C|1|Size of mirror did not match the original, nor did the plastic housing pattern on the section to which the mirror attaches. We returned it to Amazon.
B001G782Q0|5|Fit perfect on my jaguar....
B007VS0EDM|5|Hours of use on mail vehicles daily. No issues whatsoever.
B00COYNZJ8|5|I bought this because I'm a star wars fan and I drive a car that is black with black leather interior that gets very hot in the summer.  This sunshade works perfectly and keeps my car much cooler in really hot days.  Bonus that my car looks like the cockpit of the millennium falcon!
B004AE0HP0|5|This product fit my 2008 Mazda 3 perfectly!! Very satisfied customer.
B0002ILK6I|5|fit in K1200 GT with some spacers. Price was good, I seldom shop at dealers so I do not know how much I saved. Battery got me to Billings MT and back with no issues. Will buy again...... but probably not for 10 years. :-)
B0006IX7Y2|5|Worked perfect!!
B004J8P22A|5|seems well made and a good price for $26
B000C57VE6|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It is so convenient that it saves a lot of limited place in car.
B000W0RQ8C|2|Same as the other reviewer with a Tundra. Pin wasn't long enough to go through and lock.
B00HPLFKO8|5|Item delivered on time, was as described and a very nice product, packed good would rate A+ all the way !
B00TUVF0M8|5|fast shipping and well packaged. nice sturdy  key chain rings!
B00J11NWDG|1|Not even close to fitting my Tundra.  six inches too tall and 4 inches too narrow.
B00DKDFVVC|1|Being a full-timer parked in an RV park for over a year and having trouble cleaning the sensors I figured I'd give this junk a try. YES, it is JUNK and not worth the money. I finally bought the wand, hooked it up and within 2 minutes the tank was spotless and the sensors worked. I used a lighted scope to view the interior and it was clean as the day I bought the travel trailer.
B00B1E43YS|4|I tried it and it seems to work ok but it takes quite a few passes before you see any results, I ended up wet sanding and buffing because it was faster. Maybe if the pad was big enough to fit a standard buffer, it would be much faster but the 5.25&#34; isnt even big enough for a da sander. I'm going to try cutting down an old buffing pad to fit and see if its faster. I meant to give it 3 stars but I punched the wrong star and couldn't change it!!
B00MOR4CII|5|Great seller, great product. Thank you
B00DI3DV6G|5|it arrived on time and works great.
B004GEZTZM|5|As advertised. Fit perfectly
B002G2261G|5|Very Soft! Works well! Priced right!
B00DFSV7UQ|5|Received on time. Quality product
B00RGQ1PDC|5|Fits my 07 Hayabusa rear seat perfectly! Plenty of room for carrying lunch or whatever. Expands to fit full face helmet as well... backpack option is nice as well...
B0006IX7TW|2|Broke after 30 days
B004IQM460|5|Helped me spot vacuum leaks!
B00X69UBBK|5|Used this on my Fatt & Black 2007 Road King Custom. Perfect .
B005S2LVEE|5|As advertised!  20 to 30 minutes to install on my Dodge Nitro (2007).  Looks fantastic and ready to roll... cannot wait to try 'em out!
B00BDEPJ1W|5|Very nice, well worth the money!
B00SVF0U6U|5|What a relief, to finally find something that cleaned my windshield (and other windows in my house).  I suggest everyone throw out whatever you have, and just buy one product.  This one!
B00Y1960C8|3|The product is ok, however, the strong chemical smell is still too strong after close to a month.  I'm still airing them in the screened in porch.  Can't say I would recommend
B001JT1CEE|5|works as expected
B003738Y9G|5|Now my favorite plate!!! Beautiful item
B000BPS038|5|These are great little plugs for Push mowers.<br />We use them in all of our push mower and riders.<br />Would not recommend for any 2 cycle motor.<br />Holds up really well compared to normal plugs
B00WQOCKME|5|The Ford tool kit contains lineman pliers (with a side wire cutter), needle nose pliers (also with a side wire cutter), wire cutters, locking pliers and an adjustable wrench.  These tools are well-made.  The coatings on the handles are large and won't slide off, an important feature in a tool.  I have had a few that the handles just worked off after using them a few times.  The pivot joints move freely and without slop.  Cutting surfaces line up perfectly.  Overall, I'd say these are great tools.
B004VH25U6|5|Very well made, they don't fade or anything
B007JMTSTQ|1|OK for temporary use only .cheap. faded in a week. Tore in a month....cheap
B000CRGT88|5|I brought this for my girlfriend's 2000 Chevy Impala & it came fast & it fit perfectly. I recommend it. Anchor products are tough & made well.
B005NLQAHS|5|I use this for my 2007 Nissan Versa as it is not built with a coolant  temp gauge on the dash.  Get this and download the app and you have gauges galore!  This scanner does more than my $289 tool truck scanner would ever do.  Great value.
B0022XEUPY|5|Excellent
B00Q0TIGSS|5|It was an easy plug and play on my 2000 HD Road King.  The lights look great and light up the night.
B003BR04IM|5|Wore this to Sturgis! Nice quality and very flattering!
B00F8URJ9W|4|Looks good on vehicle but I thought it said home of THE free my bad<br /><br />I
B00CXADQZ6|5|Previous review shows the blue hue that these have. That's partially fixable: get a yellow PERMANENT MARKER (not a highlighter) and color the LEDs with is and that should alleviate most of the blue hue (see pic with same LEDs everywhere as previous review)
B002XL2IEA|5|Very well made
B001EGWD3G|4|It did the job that I bought them for.  Fit perfect
B000C06Y76|5|Fit perfectly in my car.
B00YI5W3NU|5|Item as described. Installs easily. Looks great. A++
B005GXQDHU|5|Arrived on time and works just the way it was supposed to
B008A5Y4DG|4|wrong item code for my HHR
B00K8E0WAG|5|Was on the lake for 3 hours using speeds between 3-5 (mostly 4).  When I got the battery back to the charger, it said I had 60% battery left.  Not bad for a constant 3 hour run time.  It's half the size of a regular battery and a 1/4 of the weight.  Perfect for my Mariner 4.
B00JB0DKJS|4|Fits good, but the instructions weren't super great.  I feel like I installed them right but they still don't seem right  however the fitment on the seats themselves are perfect.  I recommend them
B00I50SKFO|5|Checked a while to find a perfect fit for my acura 2014 and these weather proof liners are awesome. Covers all the way to the top on both driver and passenger floors. Inexpensive compared to Acura brand mats. This will be a one time investment and you wont get disappointed.
B003ZWL3KQ|5|Great product for a cheap price 100% recommended
B0058VT4ZS|4|Everything fits most cars except the back seat cover you might have to modify a little
B007W7IWK4|5|Good product!
B0031B8JIU|5|Excellent
B000CO9NUW|4|Four stars because it didn't bend like other people said when I was adjusting the plugs for my c5 corvette. However, I will say I found this tool annoying to use and opted for the bar one.
B006B20CH2|5|Ecellent
B000CITK8S|4|It works.
B002MWNT84|5|Perfect replacement!
B0009IQZH0|5|Super soft. Great from drying after a car wash. And great for polishing and detailing
B00OFUUOHA|3|I gave this a 3 because it is a quality product but know what you are ordering.  These do not fit Silverado 2007-2013 for reverse lights as advertised.  They do fit the brake light slots but they are of no use there. Now I'm stuck with 2 bulbs I can't use.
B000COBCK6|4|nice fits well
B00GB8614E|5|Is a good product, solid workmanship and works as advertised.
B00NHBYOA6|4|Nice product for road trips
B000C7QJ7O|5|Chevy blazer runs like nrw
B00GHT6SF4|5|Fast easy order and delivery.  Simple installation and looks great.  You won't be disappointed.
B00HWS7XGW|5|Good lights bulbs
B00EP3PPEY|5|Easy to install & was done in about 45 minutes. Fit good and look great, very functional!
B000C5608O|1|Did not fit my vehicle
B004ZF3YWM|5|I order this hids kit for a 96 Buick le saber works great no problems with them have them for 3 weeks much better then other ones I order that why I give 5 starts
B00AEK55WY|5|Works great and very bright
B00BITI5EK|5|Worked perfect.
B0068FV9EW|1|Person who bought this has used it but does not like to  leave feedback.
B000KSTFJO|3|Not to bad for the money.
B00PKZWSLO|5|Just like photo in add.  Professional embroidery.  Well made.
B000C8Z7J4|3|I bought this exhaust system thinking it would be an exact fit for my 1989 F-250, I found that the hangers, return line on the exhaust return tube on the converter does not match. The welding is poor quality, I thought it would be a better fit.
B006TMKXL4|5|fit perfectly, installed in a snap
B0013G03I4|2|Like it states in description , mine did not look like the picture. Was not Delphi. One out of the three failed on second day of driving. Auto parts store around the corner sales these for $160 a piece , These are almost to cheap to be true.
B004XJ0EF0|5|These worked exactly like I needed them to!
B00EMKDH86|5|good quality
B00877SL2M|5|I can assure you that these are the real deal. I bought them because in my state the police are like money sucking vampires. Any chance they get, and you'll receive a violation. This is one problem I've thrown away. LED lights do last many times longer than OEM. Who looks at their licence plate lights while driving down the road? Problem solved. Now, to change my tail lights, to LED.
B00AX72ZR6|5|Easy install
B0091ICFRI|5|I'm extremely happy to have my car back. It's difficult to find a good price on an ecu, and this saved me from having to wait months until I could afford a reman. Thanks for giving me my pride and joy back!
B000AMBOIK|5|does the job
B0019IBVDC|5|ZX2 requires this to replace the one that deteriorated and leaked anti-freeze.
B00CA96RYM|5|VERY GOOD PRICE
B00HVIGWEC|5|i love it
B00QN96G28|1|Junk. Not even close to original equipment. Spend the extra money for a good one.
B005BNP7UO|4|Had to get different screws but its plastic and works great
B004HUEL2C|3|Did not fit
B00EU85HQA|4|good set looks great quick  shipping  thanks
B00K3263WY|5|Worked PERFECT.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the directions.<br /><br />This product definitely will save your life!
B003F0DWJ8|5|Love the smell!
B00LFL8A2S|4|It was the right part, but the people needed to get the car going sooner than the part came...so need to return.<br />Was great otherwise.
B0031GYOX4|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B00E9BEBO2|5|It came on time but the right one brake
B00AYO2UHS|5|So worth the money!!  I tried the manufacturer liners....like putting a small carpet in.  These truly do what the say!  I spilled a soda, and it stayed in the liner.  I will never have a car without the WeatherTech liners or heated seats again!
B0031ZDU62|5|minor expense to install with the installation of a new intake manifold.
B000EQR7XS|5|Fits perfectly.  Better than the original one.
B00HJE5GI6|5|Perfect as description
B000JFHMQ6|5|Look and feel of this meter is good.  Precision and accuracy are good, autoranging is reasonably fast, and when I need quicker readings, selecting the range manually eliminates the delay.  The continuity check buzzer is loud enough to hear.  I replaced a Radio Shack 22-163 (20 years old) with this meter and it appears to be equal in performance and better in ruggedness.  This meter is a bit more expensive than others but for me is worth the extra for the quality product.  I especially like the 15 minute time-out feature for preserving battery life.
B00BLZ9XQK|5|Installed with LED lights on a golf car, as the flasher included with the wiring harness I bought was for incandescent lights and would not allow the lights to flash.  Great price and it works perfectly.
B0031ZDU62|5|Great product.
B00NIZZZ5Y|5|Fit perfectly and cheaper than OEM.
B00XL7LN1O|2|Didn't work as expected.  It is still showing that I have bulbs out.  I followed the direction exactly and made sure everything was connected up positive to positive.  It did stop the flickering but unfortunately I still get a bulb out warning.
B000N4ZUSU|5|Works Great!
B004J378DG|5|Only buy Denzo
B0009H51MG|5|works great and does what an air filter should.
B000PWYBN0|5|Denzo or nothing
B009NLMWT4|3|If you can keep the mud off the switch and not hit it with you leg getting on or off your atv then it works good
B00I4WZ2LI|5|These work awesome! Best replacement terminal you can buy!
B00H9JRO1S|4|Great tow package, comes along with easy-to-install wiring harness (& there are plenty of How To videos on YouTube to demonstrate for you).  Great price for this package.  I got a cover that says Jeep for another ten bucks.  Looks awesome!
B002J8379C|5|No issues, works great, could not have asked for a better deal
B000CMD9TK|5|Good locks.  Fit perfect on a 2015 WRX but they are taller than stock lug nuts.
B00HG76A9A|5|Use in my Audi S4.  Great oil and when on sale at Amazon, you cant beat the price.
B00I03984S|5|This worked out perfectly.  http://livemyassoff.com/2015/07/25/the-sena-gopro-bluetooth-audio-pack-awesome-part-1/
B000778LC0|5|Works as it should, Very Durable.
B00JVHLS3G|3|it is a great value for what you pay, however, use Gorilla glue to attach the emblem.  The sticker is not heavy duty.  We have 2 BMW's that the emblem was pried off of and replaced both.  The sticker flew off of one car with in two days of adhering.,  we checked the other and it was about to come off so we took Gorilla glue to help adhere it better.
B00G9AIBMO|4|A little overpriced, but worked perfectly. Easy to install, just followed a youtube video. The wiper works like when I just got the car, very satisfying.
B000C98EH0|2|did not fit my honda civic 2000 lx<br /><br />product came brand new in package.<br /><br />good product, wrong fit.
B00BI6BHWU|3|Looks and fits great! Too noisy and I think my truck ran better without it. When passing a car the truck is extremely loud and almost feels more restricted than stock.  It's ok around town but I was a little disappointed in performance. I haven't noticed any gains in fuel mileage. If any, maybe .5 mpg. It's a good looking intake but that's about it.
B0051D3MP6|5|Great product at a reasonable price.
B00JIIZCM6|4|My calfskin cowboy boots had lost their luster, and I had given up on traditional shoe polish. The boots are supple and don't fare well with traditional shoe waxes and brushing. For an extra two bucks, I purchased the spray application bottle--great for reaching leather overlay. Now my boots have a shine not seen in years. Highly recommended product.
B00DHGPVKI|5|Works well (4 A max) and can charge Optima AGM deep cycle 12 V batteries (blue top with grey sides).  It also can reasonably recover Optima AGM batteries that have been fully discharged.  The multi-stage microprocessor controlled charger is super.<br /><br />Update September 2015: The LCD (central circular) went bad after several months (but &#60; 1 year).  As this is an &#34;Automotive&#34; product, Amazon return policy applies.  This same display problem has been noted for the Opitma 12 A charger, unfortunately, apparently this 4 A product has demonstrated similar quality issue.
B00DHUA9VA|4|Doesn't have xm connection box in kit but everything else works great!
B00JIIZCM6|5|Good leather cleaner!
B00CU7W0HW|1|Installed without a problem and worked initially but has failed to work properly within a few uses. The bendix/starter will not disengage after starting the quad. Forced to do the entire remove and replace process again! Not happy with the quality of this product.
B011B968HW|1|piece of crap. Retractor on one side completely broken. packaging not done to protect goods. belting looks cheap.
B0013RKEZU|5|Put in my son's 2000 wrangler and it's perfect.
B009IZEWRK|5|Awesome but very expensive. There are many other option less expensive with also good quality.
B006K8VIAM|5|Great product
B000CKTJV4|5|Excellent construction. Rugged
B00KTIYXLU|1|Rubbish don't waste your money they don't work
B000O5EW9G|4|Very good product
B00F2OJG1S|3|Works fine, installed easily.
B00157TGXY|5|These worked exceptionally well during my almost two years living in a travel trailer full-time. And that includes hot Texas summers!<br /><br />I was happy to find something that was more environmentally friendly than the alternatives, which eased my conscience a bit, especially once I found out they worked just as well as the nasty blue stuff.<br /><br />I can't speak to whether or not the claim about not needing special toilet paper applies since I continued to use the rapid dissolve tissue anyway.
B006TMKWP6|3|Part came in correct and installation was a snap.
B00I8V8TME|4|Good helmet overall, great for the price.
B008S79R9M|5|Retro 60's look!
B00W8H4KH2|5|We've all had those days when our car won't start because the battery's low, or we come out of the store to find one of our tires is low on pressure.  Standing around and waiting for a mechanic to come takes half your day away, and time is one thing we cannot regain.  What's your solution? The Brightech(tm) - VIPER Car Jump Starter with Air Compressor.<br /><br />Not only will it charge your battery so that you can drive to a mechanic without wait, but it would also fill your nearly flat tire.  It's so powerful that it could even power your laptop or smartphone. Yes, this is one smart charger.  It comes with one compact external power battery with 500 Amp peak, a pair of mini-jumper clamps, 8 laptop adapters, one USB cable, a home wall charger, cigarette charger, 12V cigarette adapter for the Air Compressor, and a leather carrying case. The air compressor works with 12-volt power outlets; and  includes nozzle adapters, pressure gauge, 10-ft cord, and a 20-inch hose.  Powerful enough to recharge dead car batteries again and again, it does require a full recharge to the Viper every 6 months.  The Viper weighs only 1 pound 5 ounces and believe it or not, with all this thing has going for it, there's even a built-in flashlight.  I keep this in my car wherever I go so that I take no risks while travelling far or close.  It's saved me a few times, and plenty of money - mechanics calls for road service cost a fortune.  Not with the Brightech(tm) - VIPER!<br /><br />[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]

B00ANPQFPQ|3|got what I expected, no surprises
B00C2SIPZK|4|wears nice
B003K20JXI|4|This is a huge cup for coffee. This is the second purchase for me. I bought this for my husband who left his original green version at work, which disappeared. The shape of this mug keeps it on the dashboard when driving. It is a good buy at around $10. The base of the coffee mug will not fit any standard cup holders in vehicles. My husband said it kept his coffee hot for a couple of hours.
B00AVZRQM4|3|so so , I thought this was really a good price, 20$, but upon seeing them...they are worth about 13.95 for the both of them. they are paper thin and really really cheap materials. having said that....they look pretty good, and are basically doing the job....so 3 stars. the 'grey' is grey blue.
B008MISDGU|5|great price
B00KZ3201O|5|This is a really good quality charger for $500.  The other comparable types from Leviton and Chargepoint may look fancier but they all do the same thing.  The added bonus on this one is that is it very compact. You don't need a huge attachment to mount on the wall.  I just have it next to my outlet can move it very easily since space in my garage is at a premium.
B008IJNSTK|5|Perfect, runs better than new!
B00QHZV7IQ|3|There's really only one issue that is really bad with this product and you'll see it on other reviews.  No ability to mirror the video so when you're backing up you have to turn the opposite direction that you are seeing...doable, but a pain.  Fix it please...I'm not an app writer, but this can't be that complicated!
B00ZQW0660|5|My 2013 Honda Civic looks great with this installed. Love it. The way the New Civics are, you can't put a straight tip on them without it looking dumb. This is nice, as it has the curved pipe inside to install nicely. You can't see the bolts (that you tighten) to the muffler either. Perfect.
B000C9FE3C|4|Fit and worked fine.
B0076D5OI2|5|Easy to replace.  Works great.  Ran it for 16 hrs without a sputter.  A lot less expensive than the dealer was offering.  Had to call Airtex to make sure of the correct model for my generator.  Their customer service was very helpful.  My recommendation is to call Airtex customer service if you do not see your specific generator in the specs.  Best bang for the money.
B00T1CT0GI|4|I took a chance not ordering extra mounts hoping the ones that came with the system would work.<br />I have a Harley Road King Classic, the brackets that came with the speakers I did use and they gave me flexibility on where to mount them, but I did have to order “Kurgakn 1420” one inch  for my handle bars and “1 ¼  Speaker  Mounts Chrome for Harley”  for my engine guard.  Both on Amazon.<br />I decided to build an L- bracket which would fit behind my windshield pack. I did raze the pack about an inch (see photos) I picked up some aluminum flat bar from Home depot and made the “L” bracket. I cut two extra pieces off too mount to the bottom of the amp. I used o-rings to space the gap so the amp will be secure but will slid off easy from the L-bracket becoming a quick connect so I am not tied down when removing my windshield.<br />The first time I mounted the handle bar speakers I put them on the bottom of the handlebars. The system would not work at all. I was getting interference between the amp and the speakers. After I moved the speakers up the problem was solved.<br />The system has enough power at 85 mph that I can hear the tunes, wish they had a little more Base but for the money I would do it again. So far I am very happy with the system.
B0082JZYI4|5|JUST RITE
B00S1U5TWA|5|Love the quality of these &#34;rags&#34; - good absorbency. The &#34;silk&#34; trim around the edge of these towels is a nice added touch. Makes keeping your car clean and dust-free a breeze. The custom colors are an added fun bonus.
B00SQ349X2|5|Great that it included the sticky things to attach it to the car. Easy enough to install in one minute.
B004HCU77I|5|This was a great started kit to do carwashes at home.  I would advise you to pick up an extra water magnet and possibly an extra microfiber towel in addition to this kit.
B00LS5R0PO|5|worked wonderful used it on dump trailer
B00CDDDDEW|5|Nice buffing wheel. Great one to have around for scuffing up the inside of a tire or inner tube to help in provided and good bonding surface for the rubber cement and patch to adhere to.
B006FXGFR8|5|Flawless, light yellow, for show mostly.
B005DSMVHY|4|on my 96 impala ss as i type.
B000HBNX38|5|I used this to treat the top of two cargo containers, before primer and paint. This stuff works wonderfully, even on DEEPLY pitted/scaling steel.
B005JU5YCU|5|These are the best wiper blades bar none!
B000CMF5ME|5|Seem to be high quality, just need to have them installed, will update. Didn't arrive in clam shell package but has no visible damage, let's see after installation.
B00OZ8SDMU|5|Good sturdy visors...Item was received as scheduled; it didn't fit my car. Had to contact Customer Service; they were very proactive, courteous and helpful.
B010SNV2R8|5|Extremely bright. Built durable enough to mount as a fog light on the jeep, but small enough to use as a spot light with an extension wire while outdoors at night!  Going to have to order another one for the atv because it is so much brighter than the stock light. I can light up the field for 100 yards to see what the dogs are barking at, and use it to light up the yard at night for the pool.  Disclaimer:  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.
B00FWP8QBS|5|Fits perfectly!
B00SN7KX54|5|Fit 2011 Malibu key remote perfectly.  Works like a charm!
B00A14H3TG|4|good tool
B0015RFVV0|5|My husband bought this for his truck...excellent purchase.
B000P7O5DG|1|Adapter works fine, except it gets very hot. It gets so hot you can't hold it in your hand.  We used the first time the last few days, and I will be returning it.  We bought it to use with a small igloo cooler, and it ran well, but can't trust it to leave on overnight.  I will contact them tomorrow and hope to return it.  Not sure if it is just defective, but just don't want to take a chance. I will contact Igloo, to get a different one.
B00OE5YXBE|5|Thank you a looks good on my car
B00KTUY1IS|2|Was smaller than what I expected in addition to parts not being properly assembled
B00HR5RYNW|5|Ordered this on a Friday, received it next day =)<br />Fits exactly how it should. It's what I needed. If you have an '07 Honda Pilot and need a cup holder, this is the one to get.
B00JGBYWVC|5|works well and easy to install.
B003WM8PJQ|5|best thing since heli-coils came out, except this replaced a bad heli-coil.  Would highly recommend this product, it's the best.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Very useful! Works great, I highly recommend it. When needing to park your bike on hot asphalt or other surfaces like dirt or grass this is prefect.
B000NVW1LM|5|Works well.
B0066R9MNC|5|Muy bien!!
B0061C1JYW|5|Works AWESOME in my race trailer
B00SI6NPS2|2|It was returned as it did not fit the Cadilac as it said it would..but very nice quality...
B00B3I2LKA|5|This was my first experience actually spraying on undercoating with a gun as opposed to using a spray bomb. It was an interesting experience, but I believe a good one. I used a TCP Global undercoating gun that I bought specifically for doing this job. I didn't reduce the undercoating (although I thought I may have to at first), but rather used 80 psi at the gun instead to get some kind of a &#34;flow&#34; at the gun. It's a slow process and &#34;spatters&#34; on rather than flows on, but if you take your time you'll get very good coverage with a nice texture. How well it will hold up has yet to be seen. I should mention the project was an 8' truck bed that was inverted off the truck. I plan on sandblasting the frame of the truck and undercoating it as well. I should also mention that clean up is quite time consuming and messy! I used enamel reducer which cuts the undercoating, but it's so thick it definitely takes some time to clean everything well. For the price of the gun, I was almost tempted to pitch it and buy another one for the next project! Overall, I'd do it again and plan on ordering more for when I do the frame of the truck.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Made my install so much easier.  Great quality, fast shipping.
B00NX1VJU8|5|Best wax around
B00P9R8O7K|1|not a very good quality product, even at the price. Only in the car a week and they are already coming apart. Extremely cheap
B00HMX6DUY|5|Honestly when I bought them I was expecting them to barely light up my bed when mounted right behind the cab corner. That was not the case these things easily light up 100 foot maybe more behind my truck! Very impressed! I will be buying these again!
B00WH1ZC80|5|These are great!  No more worries about groceries falling out when you open the car door.
B0002NYB78|4|These pinch it off just fine
B00F5QNWC2|3|Lasted me 1 yr, 1 month, about 14k miles.<br /><br />I think it is acceptable for it's price. Lets be realistic, I had a Quality HID kit that lasted me 6 years before, and that kit cost me $180. So for the price of this kit, I can't expect too much.
B009G5ERVS|5|A good product for a great price haven't had a problem.
B00E4W9IEO|5|Perfect fit working like it should be.
B010GFDCE4|4|Great fit on my old 99 GMC Sierra Z71 SLT. Bought one that said it would but didn't first time around (FH Group-no bueno) so I'm really happy that this vehicle make/model categorization was on point.
B00IABD4MC|5|As advertised.  Fast delivery and works well.
B0009IQZH0|4|I use these towels to clean my paintball helmet (lenses). They do work to allow me to see.<br /><br />Hand-washing is required to maintain them. You can not stick them in the washer or dryer.
B00FY810YI|5|This is a great after market replacement for the price. But it did not come with instructions.
B00JE5ZJGC|5|5 out of 5 perfect hellmet
B010LTYNA2|5|I haven't received my x400 to try these batteries in yet but everything seems to work just fine with the charger.  Received the charger sooner than expected.  I would do business with this vendor again.  I certainly didn't (don't) have the problems that the other commenters seem to have had.  I'm completely satisfied.
B013GZLOW8|5|it cured my constipation!
B00SHU8W50|5|It was the right part, but I had to extend the wires because they were to short.
B00L5RMPT6|5|Good heavy tow rope.  The material is wide and strong and pulls all the weight it's supposed to.
B0002UEOPA|5|Great price great product. It lasted over 7 years on my diffs. Easy to work with does what it says
B00KTHWI4U|5|Absolutely love my new pink remote, wish they had it in a light purple or turquoise but not a huge deal. Bought the blue one for my hubby too. Easy to program and is a great price. Highly recommended for a replacement!
B00KU17UXY|5|Perfect fit.
B004AIDK50|2|Part worked for 2 days may not have worked totaly at all
B001QWN8N2|5|Looks great on the 4Runner
B0091YV1F4|3|Lights work great, just cannot use them!  Found out color illegal for use in Michigan, blue and red for emergency vehicles per state police.
B0009IQXAE|4|c
B00CFALFXY|5|like them so much just sent them as a late thank you gift to a hostess
B00SK49JNM|5|We installed this light on a polaris rzr 800 s with a  custom mount and billet clamps. I was not sure about this light becuase of the very  low price ( &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;)when compared to the name brand manufactures however I must say I am very pleased with this purchase. This light works very well still haven't taken it on the trails and beat it to death, that will be a test with in its self which I will update on later. As far as the brightness if I had to rate on a scale of ten I would easily give this bar a 9. I also like the fact that the light that's projected is uniform and wide. It comes with stainless steel mounting bolts and aluminum brackets which are coated black. The wiring harness is easy to use and of decent quality not sure if the on and off switch is marine grade but I mounted mine where it won't get wet or muddy too much. After some trail testing I will update this review.
B000VSYFFW|5|Fit right easy to install
B00SBZRR8O|5|I love this thing, it makes putting gas in my boat much easier.... especially since the gas cans today aren't much fun to work with
B006CQVGYK|4|It looks great on my truck
B00T2RDPZO|1|1*<br /><br />Arrived DOA<br /><br />Nearly impossible to remove its so fragile...
B00BD62X9Q|5|Works great. There is voltage on all of the pins, but when connected to the trailer the resistance apparently makes the system work properly. I did not wire directly to my battery as my 2011 Rav4 has a DC outlet in the back compartment, so I purchased a DC adapter and spliced it together. It cost me a little more, but only took me a couple of minutes to install.
B001OMEPEU|5|Nice for a cheap price
B0009IQXJ0|5|Very good product. No splatter while driving, doesn't run into wheels and stays on tire for weeks.
B00DBESE64|1|Do not work for Daytime Running Lights.  Don't know if they work for other lights.
B005FKRB70|1|Do not buy if you own a 2010 mazda3i. The front rotors in this kit are 11.5&#34; and 11.0&#34; and the rotors on the car are 10.9&#34; front and 10.4 rear.
B003ULZGFU|5|Awesome!  Just keep it in doors and make sure to lube it up with silicone spray.  I left it out one night and it rusted up in NO TIME!<br /><br />I sprayed it down, cleaned it up, and now keep it indoors.  Great idea, great product, and boy does this thing lift!<br /><br />I can lift the front end of my RV with ease with just one of these.
B0022ZGYUQ|5|fit perfect. an almost exact replacement for the one i lost.
B00KX35HTS|5|All the lights come one at once so only one switch required. Super bright. Doesnt have a lot of distance but the bigger ones may. I hunt alot and this helps me see deer and other wildlife so i can avoid hitting them. Would buy again. Will buy bigger ones
B00YE5Q132|5|[[VIDEOID:be2a71579b6351334a4f46cf24d67850]] I received a free sample for review, and, unlike a lot of products, this isn't one you can just typically use in your day-to-day life. It has one basic use: starting your car when the battery is dead. And, hopefully, that isn't something you need to do often.<br /><br />So, I charged it at left it in my car. My car is seven years old, and the battery is getting feeble, so I need to replace it soon. As it so happens, I left the dome lights on while at work (I'd been trying to find something, turned them on, and forgot to turn them off), and that was enough, over the course of a long day, to drain the battery.<br /><br />Few people were at work, it was a Friday, and I just wanted to get home, so, instead of calling AAA, I recalled I had this, and I used it.<br /><br />It's brilliant. Literally and figuratively. It couldn't be easier to use - clamp the clamps to the car battery terminals, plug them into the DPPOWER battery, turn it on, get into the car, start the car. Done. I'd read the manual before, so I knew to attach the jumper cables before attaching to and turning on the DBPOWER, so keep that it mind (it's the safest way). Likewise, detach them from the DBPOWER before disconnecting them from the car battery.<br /><br />So.. this works. That's essential.<br /><br />Less essential but also great:<br /><br />* The case is fantastic and one you'd be happy to keep in your car.<br /><br />* There are lights for use connecting this in the dark, for sending an SOS signal in emergencies (same light) and for flashing a hazards light (different light) - these are very useful and potentially life-saving if you cannot start the car for some reason (possibly extreme cold and a larger vehicle) and want to be seen on the side of the road (no car battery = no car hazards lights, obviously).<br /><br />* Accessory ports to power your smartphone and other devices (multiple voltages can be output through the accessor port). This is probably only an issue if your car just won't start and you need to keep your phone alive, but this will also function as a somewhat large, somewhat expensive external battery.<br /><br />I do wish there were a way to keep the battery charged with the (included) 12V car charger *while it was still in the case*, but that's nit-picking.<br /><br />I tried this, I used it, and it works. Get one for your car, just in case.

B00V30J86I|5|Fits well in my Mazda. The dogs haven't been in the car yet, we will see.
B000PA03AC|5|I bought this cable after trying the cheap $7 one that didn't work. This cable worked flawlessly in my 2005 BMW X3 with BMW Business CD radio. There are good tips on how to remove your stereo on Youtube.<br /><br />I mounted the cable in the cubby above the stereo. I removed the cubby and drilled a hole into the angled part of the cubby. AUX mode showed up and now I am rockin' out with my tunes.
B00NWGZ3A6|3|RETURNED. Didn't have a need for it. However, looks like it would do all it's supposed to do.

B00ONH5JAM|5|Perfect fit. Quick delivery and well packed. Just the right part, but now I need to buy the other side so it looks new too!!
B0027UMWU2|1|I can't describe how upset and mad I am. I bought this for my ATV it is a sportsman 300 and it is too big. the instructions said to take off the front brush guard and headlights I did so and it still didn't work. I spend about 2 hours and it didn't work tried everything possible but still didn't work. very upset.
B008WTVSM0|4|funny!
B00WRV3JC6|3|Took quite a bit of modification to my truck to get it installed.  It is a bit taller than the factory arm rest.
B0051UAM0M|5|Love it.....Great for my dogs
B003QVJ79K|5|awesome! came with great instructions and mounting hardware, even new thermostat and gasket.  Truck is running great since installed.

B0068C3ACO|5|Does everything it claim it can do! Right exhaust has been cleaned, was same as left one!!
B007OW6MD6|5|Works as advertised!  I have used these on multiple toyota vehicles with no issues.  Much better price than the dealership.
B00D3YEGO6|5|Bought this as a gift for a friend and it looks GREAT on her car!  Comes very nicely packaged and with everything you need!  It does not look cheap like some of the others I have seen.
B005SJ5SSM|5|Looks great
B008JJWEXA|5|All the heat-out gear work like magic -- much much better than wearing something like under armour - when you put it on, you instantly feel cooler than you did with no shirt at all. It is important this this fit close against the skin to work properly. It will feel tight, and cool. The heat-out brand from cycle gear is absolutely the best and a steep discount below the cost of similar gear from name brands. I love the helmet liners so much I even use them while mountain biking.
B0052FRP74|4|Although it fits on my door now I did have to tweak with the back of the door handle a bit in order to make it fit properly in my 99 Camry. Other than that it works great
B00Q374HQW|5|great seatbelt extender, I'm currently using this in my Crystler 300 2008 model, no issues whatsoever, works just as advertised and helps with a better fit in our car. Thanks guys!<br /><br />Note: I received this at a discount for my honest review
B001D8TGJE|5|Large head, sturdy brush. Very soft, so no worries about my fiberglass. Highly recommend!
B00EUZZK5G|5|as advertised
B000BUQOFO|5|Works exactly as needed!  Have referred to others!
B000C7TSNG|1|ABSOLUTE garbage. Installing a heater core isn't a simple plug and play job. This garbage core lasted 3 1/2 months. THREE AND A HALF MONTHS! I don't even know how Spectra calls themselves a business and produces products this bad. I wouldn't be so callous if they didn't earn such a reputation...but after a little research (that I should have done beforehand) it's pretty clear that they make worthless products. So now, because I went cheap, my vehicle will be down for days, I've had to pull my entire dash, half my wiring, the entire air box and buy new parts. Because of this I've had to cancel a trip...my only vacation this summer. So instead of spending time at the beach I'll be cleaning coolant out of all my vents, washing my floorboards and pretty much reinstalling the entire interior of my vehicle. Pathetic
B00HQFB538|4|easy installation
B00EJ81Z9O|5|Works great.  I don't break mine down into the separate pole sections.  No leaks and it connects securely to the propane tank.  I'm very happy with this distribution tree.
B0062IJOJ2|5|Item as described, installed in about a half hour.
B00YGUZE9M|5|It's a pretty hot pink!!
B009Y269Y6|5|Works just as it says, but it lumps up if the glue is not smooth
B00C977VWM|5|Son loves them.
B009OHH4FO|3|Like all welpers, three spring lasted about a week...otherwise, great pliers. Similar paid can be found at your local tractor store for about 1/4 off the price.
B000HBM5TQ|5|Good quality, worked well.
B002LYQALQ|5|Works really well, have use it numerous time with no drips or leaks.
B007Y3BKNC|3|Switches feel a bit cheap, not sure how long they will last.
B00EPA7CZC|5|Bright little lights that work well.  I found 1 or 2 bad but with the kit of 10 and at this price, you can't go wrong!
B00BI9DN8I|5|Great product!
B00FQQLHV4|5|Worked perfect for old pop coolker
B00K64RSQY|5|very cool
B00062YILO|5|Replaced OEM style filter with this K&N. You could definitely feel the difference, especially in the 3K-5K range. I would recommend this filter to anyone trying to get the most out of their Tacoma's V6.
B000MKENHO|5|Repainted my 92 RS and replaced all gaskets/seals.<br />These metro units work really well and at a great price.
B0025P29WK|5|Perfect fit for the 2006 Toyota sienna :)

B0097U1E4U|5|Awesome, the wife loves it!
B0055EJ7X2|5|Nissan product, all four caps - &#34;Nismo&#34; has a chrome filling in the red &#34;O&#34; that is barely visible in the photos, very clean, very light, added to my '10 Nismo 370z.
B00OUSJK7C|5|Very good!!
B00029KA86|4|a good cover
B004I0FCWO|2|It ALMOST fit right. Usable, but I wouldn't buy it again.
B005CLKM9G|4|Glad I found it.
B00K4C1TZY|2|These do not fit a 2005 Suzuki GSX-R750 very well. I had to modify the mirror to fit in my old base bracket so it would sit correcctly on my motorcycle.
B00PC0G07A|5|I love it.
B000NVW1LM|5|Awsome
B00JH33YU4|3|Front mats fit well. The back row is too small.
B00B1FOWA2|5|Arrived in good time, easy to install, fit perfectly. I love it.
B00IOWYF48|5|Works great and allows all old oil to drain
B002P8CIIW|5|Fit and works perfect. Easy to install.
B00UBG2GPK|3|It looks and feels great but I just am not happy with the color. Now that it's on my wheel it's a slight off color from my gray interior on my Honda. It's mostly my fault but there's no real way to return this. So I will probably eventually get the black and start over. Unfortunately, you don't really see the color until you get it on. I recommend to always go black so you won't be disappointed in the tone.
B000C57UTM|5|So far so good. Will see for how long.
B007XY5K6K|5|Great product,, No issues with seller. Fast shipping,, Item as described. A++
B0002SRCMO|5|Lifts the old fasteners right out.
B00BCRMB34|1|Horrible
B00I6VTUWY|5|Looks great! Love the dual uses. Hopefully I will never have to use it.
B000CQDNX8|5|Good product.
B006H34AE6|5|I love it. I have 2 shelties, both of which hate to be brushed, which means there is fur everywhere in my apartment. I use it on the carpet before I vacuum (its a one bedroom and I don't mind the physical labor of crawling around on the floor). I can't believe how much hair it picks up. Now I don't have to empty the vacuum 2-3 times just to finish the living room.
B007DKQGQC|5|this sticker was awesome! started alot of interesting conversations.
B009D58DL6|5|Cute keychain!
B00CFQRB6I|5|perfect fit, bought 3 for different trucks. all fit great
B00FOOUP4S|5|Nothing wrong with this at all.
B001EP0G72|5|works great
B012XIP074|5|I order these as an alternative to the standard bulb that comes from the factory. Within a day i already had confirmation that my product had shipped. I installed them in my dash and it is awesome. I would recommend this product and company to anyone
B00C53LOUU|1|This didn't work for me at all
B002VVNXCI|5|Great sound!
B00W25Y67O|5|Went in easy arrived quickly and came just as described.
B00A5AFH30|5|I have a tri-color vehicle and need touch-up paint as this car is 12+ years old. This paint is great, matches exactly. It's easy to apply and dries great too.
B000IEAWN8|4|I have a 2008 f150. And it really awakened my truck. Installed super easy it took me 5 minutes to put on the pod and run the wire. Looks like its ment to be there. Easy programming. Makes a big difference.
B000E2CVDI|4|My bandit loves this filter will by again
B00KTIYXLU|5|Keys worked perfect. The programming was very simple when following the instructions that came with the product.
B00D2JZ4UW|5|Works great in my 2001 Mercedes ML 320. Two of my window controls were acting up and it was time to find a replacement. So thrilled to find this master switch. Fits perfect, and has been working fantastic! So thrilled to finally find a part for my Mercedes that doesn't make me cry at the price! :)
B003RWR90W|5|Works great
B000NWA6TU|4|Going strong for 50,000 miles in my 98 Chevy blazer
B00FJT0304|5|Very heavy duty tool
B002MT8S7E|5|Perfect fit and the light really helps!
B009EAC26M|4|Was a great replacement for a 2013 scion Xb . It looked good and was easy to Install. My hardest issue was putting the cover on .. The fitment was tricky but finally got on right after patients and pressing on the right spots. Also had to paint the cover to match my vehicle. But for price .. I'm all inn. Would buy again.
B0028MQPTS|5|Connected well on my 2008.5 titan.  We will see how mpg and performance improves. 5 stars for proper fitment
B00DM10J2S|1|Not very bright
B003M0WRIS|5|Nice and bright. Perfect blue 6000K tint that look great through projector headlights!
B00JF6EYCU|5|Great product
B001GBRIKW|5|Not sure of its value to a jeep in stock trim, but ive been building my wrangler for the banks sidewinder for the past 5 months..as the bank account permits ,started off by retiring my old 02 x's 4.0 for a new long block, I'm running a CAI through the firewall, afe 3 inch exhaust, mitsuzibuishida??? dual core aluminum radiator, borla headers and lost some fat in the form of redundant cats on the exhaust...with these modifications my wrangler was noticeably more powerfull, but just, was actually quite disappointed..as luck would have it my wife needed a new throttle body so I gave her mine and ordered this unit...when this part showed up today and after about 20 minutes of wrenching it was a completely different animal..acceleration is instantaneous and violent...throttle response is crisp...rpms climb to 3500 very quick and the low end power increase is incredible, no more waiting for your engine to grunt its way to 2000 rpms before the power comes on...you can do a hard first gear pull and shift into third and accelerate as if you were in second....5th gear is actually usable on a road with hills! as stated, without the supporting mods I don't know how noticeable your gains would be...but if you have done all the ground work and are wondering why your jeep is still lacking power...this is the linchpin that ties everything together and transforms your vehicle.....next step sidewinder..and after what I experienced today, I can only imagine what that's going to be like
B001539B7O|5|We use this in our RV. Its a travel trailer with the cigarette lighter port. This thing has worked great to power so many things and doesn't even really seem to get warm. hot. Doesn't make noise and works perfect!<br /><br />Here are things that we have powered with it. Mainly from the battery of our RV:<br />iPhone 6 charger<br />iPad charger<br />Nikon camera charger<br />Macbook charger (85w MB Pro)<br />Insignia 24&#34; LCD TV with DVD player. We watched TV for awhile on this with zero issue.<br />Baby monitor<br />Makita drill battery charger<br /><br />I think there is more, but thats a good starting point. As yo can see it charges pretty much anything. Also, it ran our 24&#34; TV/DVD combo, while playing DVD's in our trailer, with no issues at all. We watched a movie for about 1.5 hours during a rain storm, and it worked great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to people looking for an inverter to run small TV or to charge pretty much any of their small electronics they would need while away from home.
B0079GQ69C|5|It's an exact match and works perfectly. I am completely satisfied.
B0006BFR2O|3|So, the reviews I've read on this product were either &#34; the best thing since the wheel&#34; or &#34;total crap&#34;. I took a chance and found that both opinions had some validity.<br /><br />First- The product DOES work. The pipes on my Yamaha 1300 were VERY blue and yellow. When I was done the flaws were barely noticeable, though some gold tinge remains in spots.<br /><br />Second - It takes an FAR more time and effort to get good results than the description or instructions would lead you to believe.<br /><br />Instructions: (paraphrased) Let pipes cool. Moisten cloth with water. Dip into product to make a thick paste. Rub spots until gone.<br /><br />Reality: Let pipes cool. Moisten cloth with water. Dip into product to make a thick paste. Rub spot for 10 minutes by hand with no results. Grab foam buffing pad and drill. Polish for 40 minutes with little results. Shred buffing pad. Go to bed. Wake up. Grab orbital sander. Use orbital sander for 20 minutes. Take a break. Repeat 20 minute orbital sander step FOUR times. Wash pipes with Dawn to remove any residue. Smile.<br /><br />Pros: Product works reasonably well, though some stubborn gold tinge remains. There are no scratches in the chrome, as advertised. The large pipe wipe was VERY durable. It held up to an hour and a half on an orbital sander.
B001CE4HY8|5|fits my slide out perfect. eliminates rocking.
B00IRWFQUW|1|Both of the chains broke and the charms were lost forever within a few weeks.  Save your money.
B00P28CN28|2|Very small, like 4 inches wide.<br /><br />Looks bigger.
B000K36BCI|1|It was soo bad and not useful<br />My glasses always falls down from it
B007KFMJWA|5|Happy with these rotors.  Exactly as expected at a reasonable price from Amazon.
B00KTJ9I46|5|Worked great, easy to program.
B00AX64HEQ|5|takes the discomfort away from the hands while waxing, very versatile with the many different pads available.
B00NEX77WO|1|*****DONT BUY*****<br />TABS ARE STILL CONNECTED. I HAD TO SEND IT BACK
B005I4DNZ2|5|every thing was there makes wireing simple
B00LIDY5HW|5|I am a huge hello kitty fan! I have so much hello kitty in my vehicle that my husband no longer will drive my vehicle unless I am with him. Plus there is so much more that I still want! I got this to go with the theme  of course. This is a very nice looking vehicle plate cover. Its made of plastic like you would expect a plate cover to be. The kitty's look great! I was easily able to install this over my plate and it did not cover any important information such as the plate number or the expiration date. It fit well and my plate has stayed securely in place since attaching this. I love being the proud owner of this Hello Kitty license plate cover! I just can't wait to add more Hello Kitty to my SUV!
B00A6G5R60|5|Best product and value
B00VW0AZVG|4|No comment. All is good
B0066QYGTI|5|great
B000786GLM|5|used a little bit of this to repair a curtain wand, seems to be working so far. easy to use. I'm looking into other types of putty products, seems versatile.
B001G4X4KW|1|Way to heavy to pickup to put on the car
B00LK35H4U|4|Fit good and easy to install.
B007HFSK6M|1|Did not fit my 2015 Wrangler. Had to return it.
B00COYWVXO|5|Arrived on time, fit perfect and installation was a breeze.
B00FV1MLU0|1|The rear window shades did not fit because they were too short. One of the front shades did not fit and the window would not close with it on. I am now only using one of the shades and will be replacing all with stickon ventshades. Very very disappointed in the product. Absolute waste of money and time.
B0031B1YWI|5|Awesome fast delivery and it was so easy to install
B0002KKIVY|5|Actually did help my old lawn mower start - when I used  it (spraying into chamber via spark plug hole after removing plug) copious gray smoke poured out.  Tried starting a second time after engined cooled - without spraying more - and it started right up.  So effect is durable, unlike other more volatile starter fluids that require repeat applications.
B000B8I61G|1|Very small. The hanger is too thick to hook on door.
B0051D3MP6|1|It tells me all my batteries are bad and wont charge any when the guys at autozone test them they say theyre fine... I might just have a doa but  who knows
B000CFHD5I|5|installed these about 4 months ago and they fit perfectly and i have not had a problem. Good quality axles.
B00FBL2N76|4|Awesome product. Beware, the price is only for one mat. Had to reorder a second.
B008N21EMA|3|Great sicker but was shipped in envelope which was creased
B00842A7F4|5|It's a nylon plastic rivet what can go wrong with that. Parts are properly molded and snap well together
B00RFH9JL2|5|My daughter LOVES this set!
B005VYOGZU|5|As advertised works perfect!  Nice finish and wiring bracket is located in a great spot
B00IBOKST0|5|Very Nice Floor Mats.  I am quite critical of anything I purchase....  These are awesome.  We had the OEM (rubber) mats for our Sienna for 10 years.  They were good, not slick, but they did not cover all surfaces and they would only hold about 1/8&#34; of water.  I had a weather-tech cargo liner for a Trooper about 5 years ago.  It held water and goop well, but is was very slick.  It would have made a terrible floor mat.<br /><br />These MAXpider mats are really good.  We just put them in our new (to us) 2014 Santa Fe (3-row) (NOT a sport).  They cover all of the surfaces that matter.  They are deep enough to hold quite a bit of snow or water.  They are a little slicker than rubber, but they are not very slick at all.  They look really good and they fit perfectly.  The second row has the tabs for the OEM hooks.  The front seats have the tabs too. The runner between the second row and the third row connects together to make an uninterrupted path.<br /><br />Unlike the Hyundai all weather mats, these cover the hump between the two second row seats.  We got them two weeks ago, and have about 2k miles on them already.  They are nice, even with bare feet.  I am really happy with the purchase and I cannot recommend them highly enough.
B00PTSR5UG|5|They were as expected, received in good condition, happy with purchase.
B00VU8RP04|5|GREAT DEAL
B00KNMKRU8|5|I just hope this was engineered to last more than a year like the good old days when they made better products. So far so good.<br />Right now, its easy to use and I really am liking it.
B001CF1A7O|4|Very heavy duty and can handle anything my truck can pull.
B000CM0WU4|5|great buy easy to install saved $40 off of dealer price
B00MUF1APW|2|Nice product but not as bright as advertised.
B000BQUJL8|2|After installing these in my RV heater bypass circuit, I pressure tested them and one leaked. But then I replaced these with what looked like high quality stainless steel ball valves and they both leaked too. My pressure test only consisted of hooking up the garden hose, so I don't think I was pushing it. Ended up tearing down the SS valves and making them leak-proof. That worked.
B006B269QK|5|worked great
B00YEFHBBS|5|It was just what I expected and promptly delivered.
B00E70LKTE|1|It did not work.  We had to buy the $400.00 one at the dealership after all.
B00CEXKAK6|5|as advertised
B0012TWRBS|5|Works well on a 2014 BMW R1200RT.
B00TF8G25U|3|Not a good fit. Baggy after all you can do to cinch it up.
B000C2W8Y2|5|Ok/
B003ZWHMGU|3|Works great great bargain
B005LXTOEY|5|Great product easy to install, my first time doing this, piece of cake.
B00N2D206E|4|Easy to apply, but they stick well. I would've given them a rating of 5 stars just because I think I would've like them just slightly larger.  They do the trick though.
B001QWTT6C|4|Work well shading out the sun, but wish they were a little wider
B0058A21LI|3|I installed two of these lights in the rear windshield of my patrol car and hard wired it to my switch box. During the day, they are not as bright as I wanted it to be. When the sun is directly overhead, the lights becomes less noticeable.<br /><br />At night, it was better, just enough to get the job done. I bought the lights to make up for the poorly lit light bar (older LED light at), but these were dimmer.<br /><br />Overall, it's probably not something I would buy again, I've included a photo of the two I had installed. As you can see, they are not very bright.
B008427D88|5|Just what I needed to fix my droopy parts on my car.
B000N3CP7A|5|Exact part I needed! It arrived early and is installed. Thanks
B000F0WRS8|5|It fits like a charm.
B00LADOCHS|1|Installed this item and it had an output over 15 Volts AC; blew my lights out. This things must be defective. sucks. should have bought something else.
B002VVJFZW|1|Bought this for my 2005 G35 coupe and it actually made my car run worse. DO NOT BUY AIRTEX FUEL PUMPS!!
B0024GQZXY|2|I received B&D JUS350B as a birthday present - did not buy from Amazon so I will be reviewing this product, not Amazon service or product seller.  This device is a missed concept and has flaw in the original design.  The main and the only reason is the battery inside.  If you open the guts you will see the Sealed Lead Acid Rechargeable Battery model HYS 1290 12V 9Ah (or one of available replacements).  This is just wrong battery for the purpose.  1. First problem.  Self discharging. Sealed Lead Acid Rechargeable Battery have quite high self discharge rate which requires to recharge the battery at least once a month when the battery is not in use.  You miss charging the battery it will self-discharge to self-destruction.  If you are going to use this device once in the lifetime when you have emergency you have 90% chance the battery will be close to completely discharged just when you need it.  2. Second problem.  Battery life. Sealed Lead Acid Rechargeable Battery is known to have very short life (at least compared to regular car battery).  Mine was dead after two years.  With the cost of replacement battery about 25 dollars if is just not worth to replace the battery every 2 years.  3.Third problem.  Battery performance.  Battery HYS1290 has maximum allowed discharge rate 15s that is 135A.  350Amp shown on the B&D device is simple not true.  You may be able to get 350Amp but you will fry the battery.  The internal resistance of the battery is 16mOhm.  So if you load the battery at 350Amp you will put 2kW inside the battery so it will simple cook it's own guts.  And you will get no more than 6.5V at the end of the cable - that is not enough to turn car's starter.  Do the math yourself if you don't believe me.  This battery is simple not up to the job.  The internal battery charging circuit in JUS350B is contributing to battery life problem.  Sealed Lead Acid Rechargeable Battery must be charged with voltage 14.4V - 14.7V.  I measured the battery voltage while it wasbeing charged by internal circuit in JUS350B and after some time the voltage was exceeding 16.5V.  That will overcharge the battery causing its premature destruction.     So why did I give it 2 stars?  Because This device still can be used as (per instruction): 1. USB Charger - you can charge your dead phone or use it as a supplementary battery for your phone and even talk for hours (you will get about 9Ah when you don't load the battery more than 1/2 Amp) 2. LED Light when you change your tire at night or try to find something in dark places. 3. Charge your car's &#34;out of juce&#34; battery to the point when you can start the engine.  Of course as long as B&D is fully charged and your car battery is in good condition, but just happened to be discharged because you forgot to turn the light off.  You need to connect B&D to your car battery and wait for about half hour before you try to crank the engine.  B&D will be able to take few amps load to charge your car's battery.  It is not the best charger in the world but if you are in the middle of nowhere, it is better than nothing or waiting for AAA to arrive.  There is a way to fix all problems with this device by replacing the battery with something more reliable and better performance then &#34;gel-cell&#34;.  For example A123 (LiFePO4) can perform up to 120Amp per cell (ANR26650M1B) so to achieve 350Amp as advertised by B&D you would need at least 12 cells connected 4s3p.  A123 has very low (almost zero) self discharge rate, so if you don't use it you don't need to charge it for at least a year or  more.  The life span of A123 is 10 years or more (or 1000 cycles) so you will replace your care before the battery in such unit. However at the price  8-9 USD per cell the such device with &#34;good&#34; battery would cost probably 120 dollars or more.  On the final note because I like the shape and the concept of B&D JUS350B I am considering buying 12 or 16 cells of A123 and upgrade my B&D with &#34;charge me and forget&#34; battery pack.  I will have to modify charging unit to limit the charging voltage to 14.4V, but as the original is &#34;bad factory design&#34;, this is something what needs to be done anyway.
B005IGRR3O|5|Great product!
B004NFXA7I|5|work as advertised.
B000630IJ4|4|This is a nice pump.
B0030VPAVU|5|Solid Nismo frame and badge with flat black finish and chrome/red &#34;Nismo&#34; text.<br />Hardware included.
B000CMJ2QE|5|**Make sure to check the PDF guide to determine the appropriate size for your vehicle**<br /><br />Amazon stated that the appropriate size wouldn't fit my vehicle, which was incorrect.  I ordered the appropriate size for my vehicle and the lug nut locks arrived 2 days later as advertised.  The key fit correctly in all 4 (checked before I started swapping on the tires) and the lug nuts fit snugly in the rim of my 2012 Kia Sorento.  I purchased this style primarily for the outer ring which doesn't allow a lot of space around the outside of the entire piece or the inside.  I certainly have no doubt that someone with plenty of time and no concern for noise could drill/hammer away to remove it, but I believe as a deterrent it will work very well.<br /><br />Physically the lug nut feels as strong as a standard, nothing feels flexible or easily breakable.  Installing took less than 5 minutes for all 4 tires and while tightening down the lug nuts I didn't feel any give or stripping of the thread.  They do stand out from the standard lug nuts, but that is my intention, to deter anyone who considers stealing my rims/tires.<br /><br />I have ordered 2 more sets for a family member's vehicle, who recently had his wheels stolen.  I really think these will deter or help catch someone in the act if they attempt this again.
B005HF3BWW|5|I bought two EZ Pass-Port(s), for my 2 FasTrak transponders. I was doubtful even after the good reviews that the suction would hold up - especially under the recent 100 degree plus days we've been having. But so far, so good. The fit is bit tight with the newer wider transponders, but holds it firmly in place. This item replaced this transponder holder. [[ASIN:B000LP8F60 Ez Toll]]<br /><br />So far I am pleased with the quality and value of this product. I'll report back if this doesn't live up to my expectations. This review is my opinion - and your experience can be totally different - depending on your particular transponder and application. I'll try to report back as I use this over the months ahead. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I'll try my best to answer in a timely manner.
B00WA1U7MS|1|Cheap crap, button failed within 7 days.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Love this stuff
B004C0MO6W|5|Great product, fast delivery, recommended.
B00GWFKPNE|2|these are very thin not what I expected
B00JUQFVX6|5|good price. good quality. protects back of the car seat and I can fit many things in its pockets.
B000PGVZ30|5|It's a plug...not exactly the world's more exciting arrival.<br /><br />Well, unless you dreaded unplugging things without a nifty handle.<br />Or you really appreciate high visibly yellow.<br />Or you love it when engineers make it EASY to wire up a plug, and then secure things so nothing comes loose again.<br /><br />Well...I guess plugs can be exciting, and this one hits all the positive points.
B00AQ6YNCY|5|These are some very bright light but had to do a tiny bit of work for my running lights to get them to fit
B00CH6T18C|5|I tried several cleaners and Boo Yah is the only one that worked. Thanks!
B00675HOBU|5|worked very well in my race trailer
B005JU5UX8|5|Great wiper blades.
B00CEXK9TS|5|Original is the best, the in channel ones failed as soon as it got hot, get these you will not be let down.
B001QDJMUY|5|Perfect replacement. Easy to replace.
B00BYNJ90E|4|Installed on 2003 Toyota Tundra  2wd. Great shocks,  better than Bilstein HD's, or KYBs gas adjust which I had before. They fit nicely,  truck looks more robust,  rides better and quite leveled.  Update: they used to be bouncy on the street at first with excellent off road feel. Now they settled on road while the off road seems less energetic. this is almost a year later
B003O95MT8|5|Great product and easy to install! It snapped in to place and only took ten minutes to install.
B0048WO3A4|4|Decal looks well made but the color is a bit off
B008VOOPW6|5|Wife loves. Has sustained 75 mph .
B008DJQR3Y|5|keeps the grit where it should be!
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Love it.
B00P6I150A|5|Actually like this product. The setup was easy. It comes with 2 of everything and a mount for both the full face and half helmet
B0024E6W02|1|As i have seen others say, the plastic hose is stuck together, i am afraid to pull ot apart as i may get the holes others are experiencing.
B0009Y6DTE|4|Real nice and functional
B00G13JIOY|5|One of the cheapest best upgrades I've done to the lude. By covering up the old factory gauges. I believe it's been a nearly a year now since installment and it's still working fine. Also while installing don't rush. Seat it perfectly and you'll have no issues. Look into buying the chrome plate to go around the gauges too. It looks awesome.
B005H12QXG|5|Bought for my husband's truck we use for pulling 5th wheel, he really liked them, they give him a wider view down sides of trailer than the other mirrors he had put on...very satisfied. He said they were not hard to put on either.
B0055EALW8|5|Great price,  correct product
B006VFJ4FA|2|Person who  bought  this  product  does not  like  to leave feedback.
B00A14R6O8|5|Simple direct replacement - no latch repositioning required.  Fit perfect in my 1992 F150.  It is squirrely to seat the boot in the firewall due to tight space but not the products fault. Once in it moves freely with no drag. Had the truck 8 years and never knew how easy opening the hood was supposed to be 'till now.
B0002JMDE0|5|This stuff removed all discoloration from my wheels
B00GYDBPL0|5|Classy looking , love it!
B004EDF8HY|5|functional
B00KVVROCA|5|Fit perfect arrived sooner than expected , found out after the fact that they make one that goes completely over the front hump but this one fit perfect just the center hump wasn't cover still great product
B00OC7TSWI|5|Just wanted to give you a heads up guys I went on the West Coast trip from Chicago up to Washington down to San Diego and back-  this light was a lifesaver it felt like I was driving in HD at night time - when you're in the Mojave Desert at night it is pitch black with this thing I was able to see miles and miles ahead great purchase!
B0050DBVXM|4|Quick shipping and the do the job a described.
B00EP3PTF4|5|Looks great and so sturdy when put on the truck.  Pleasant surprise!!
B00WA1U7MS|5|Great tool to have in every family vehicle
B00AF3SS7O|5|These are great headlight lamps. I got these for my 2014 civic and they are much better than the stock halogens. Easy install, no hassle. If you don't want to go through all the work required in HIDs these are perfect. The light not seem that bright up close but the range of visibility is excellent. Honestly the best bang for your buck modification you can do. I just hope they last more than a year and won't have to replace them.
B009LNF8AY|5|Looks great. I had a professional upholstery shop install it for $90.
B0009JKGII|3|Required a LOT of elbow grease to get the tar/asphalt dots off my car.  I still had to use fingernail to get the top off and then this helped but required a lot of rubbing.
B0007VANJK|5|Easy install , bumper removal makes it easier , and actually a bit faster . Saved my truck from bumper damage already , bumped in the rear at a red light .
B00R1B1TQK|1|Installed new XA Mass Air Flow Sensor and frontier truck still unable to hold idle.  Finally bought the original Nissan Air Flow Sensor @ $500 and truck idle work like a charm.  Item does not work .
B005PODERM|4|Worked well on tires and exterior bumpers.  Only been on a few weeks so not sure how long it will last.  Seems to be better than Armor All
B00U7CSALC|5|Very comfortable, sturdy and roomy. I wish they gave out longer lines to tie onto bigger trees.
B000BNZ5BU|5|It hold water and works well
B00429NKWK|5|If you follow the instructions and work hard at it, you will be rewarded with a nice looking headlight lens.  There is also a YouTube video that really helped me.  I had product left over after doing my MiniCooper headlights.
B000GD5FMY|5|Product fits great and looks good!!
B011W3R7Q8|5|Not as bright as the ones that are clear and not black but theyre pretty bright and im happy with them.
B00DHQJ57S|5|I was very happy to come across this. I purchased the &#34;best&#34; one. The reflector  noticeably keeps the car cooler and I don't feel as bad seeing my car baking in the sun. I'm hoping this will prolong the life of the interior so the car can have better resale value. The reflector is structurally ridged and folds/unfolds easily. I don't normally use the protective storage case, but when I do it's easy to get the reflector in there and to remove it. All together it was well worth the money.
B005H7DRQA|5|Works great. It's the same stuff car washes use.
B005G8CZE0|2|Bottom of stick was cut off
B00H8S24PQ|1|Expansion is minimal.  Don't hold at all despite being correct size.
B00ANQ60U0|3|Fitment was correct installation was easy.
B000IY4AL8|5|Parts arrived as described.
B004804N7E|5|have an rv and this was exactly what I needed for my heater
B0014BCBLU|5|Good for use with aftermarket hydraulic filter applications on tractors, log splitters, hoists, mowers, etc.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Does its thing as it should.  It runs my alarm system if the power goes out.
B006H34BUY|5|Great for dusting between larger blinds and plantation shutters
B00H3NCMGW|5|It fit and is working just fine now. I was able to clear the code now using my phone app and bluetooth reader.
B00DD0X254|2|Mediocre at best
B003ZWHUJY|2|For honda accord 02 door ?
B00KN0UOEE|5|Was told to use this on our Motorhome and we love it
B00802FSC0|5|They work great and fast shipping
B00LAOMY72|1|Only recieved 3pcs im missing either the clutch or brake pedal
B000BUOSDE|5|Can't go on an RV trip without this stuff! I'm not crazy about the scent but anything is better than, well you know. We have a family of 5 and this bottle lasted for a 7 day trip to a South Carolina beach in the middle of summer. We didn't have any problems with foul smells!
B0002U268M|5|Three step process:  3M 39017 Plastic Cleaner, this product, then Blue Magic 730-6 Headlight Lens Sealer.  Worked well to restore shine and clarity to mildly hazed 14 year old plastic headlamp lenses.  Very pleased with results.
B006N933F6|4|Great price shipped fast.
B00SVKSF80|5|Very cool sticker like it alot recommend it to anyone came fast and easy to put on.
B006WQSWQA|4|Great price shipped fast.
B00553SM20|4|Fits good
B00S75A5KA|5|These are really really bright headlights. The difference was noticeable even compared to the high output halogens I was using before. As an added bonus, the LED's shouldn't burn out every 8-10 months like high yield halogens do. The install was as simple as the diagram in the listing. I will say you have to make sure they are oriented correctly in the housing. The first time i installed one it was 90 degrees off from the &#34;right&#34; way and the light beam ended up projecting very high and off to the side. A simple remove and reinsert fixed that and it was my error, not the fault of the lights. The heat dissipation belts are a clever solution and they seem to work pretty well. All in all these are a can't miss considering they cost less than 2 pairs of &#34;good&#34; conventional bulbs and should never need to be replaced.
B0081LTN12|5|What an awesome buy! I love these lights, they make my car so much brighter.<br />For the price this is a nice little upgrade to the stock interior lights which is both practical and make make you car look a bit nicer.<br />They are also very easy to install, only taking about 20 minutes.<br /><br />+Very bright<br />+Easy to install<br />+Enhance the feel of the car<br /><br />Would purchase again.
B009MAT1GI|5|After purchasing my 2015 Honda Civic, I was having the worst time finding a sunshade in general, let alone one that actually fit my car. This custom made one fits perfectly so now I don't have to worry about sun damage or burning myself on those hot days! This product is great quality as well. Very satisfied!
B004QBNA8I|5|Fit perfectly and works great. Found out the door lock actuator motor is blown, but not anything to do with the replacement handle.
B000QQD7IA|1|One of the part was completely broken and we couldn't use it.
B0042Z0E6E|5|Nice quality and folds up easily to fit in the carry bag.
B0002NYB6Y|3|It calls itself a flat band clamp pliers but the screw in ends is better made for the round hose clamps like GM uses - not like the flat band that Ford's use. And the clamping end of this thing requires so much space that it renders itself useless in all but a few applications. But it looks nice in a tool box seems to be constructed well and the ratcheting part of it works great and releases easy.
B0065KKXL0|4|Worked great, first time user.
B0000AZ6WB|4|As advertised.  Reasonable quality at a reasonable price
B0006Z9SSY|5|What can I say?  It makes my tires and dash shine - just like I expected.
B00KJGKZTQ|5|I love it
B000N37CYG|5|For what i used it for it worked perfectly.
B002692308|1|Absolute joke. Fell off within one week.
B000BUU5WW|3|Great price and fast shipping but they don't work on uneven ground.
B0068ERUXM|5|Excellent
B000BO6MBG|2|this not water resistant because rain.
B008BQR0WQ|5|It is a wonderful spoiler and fits amazingly on my 06
B00C8D9U9E|1|This connector only has one Quick Connector not two, so it is for repairing an existing line. The description appears to be wrong.
B004SG5C0A|2|Purchased this along with the companion for the right side (545-1770) in November 2014. By July 2015 after less than 4,000 ordinary suburban minivan miles (i.e. no autocross, off-road, or other abusive activity) it has failed. The top bushing portion is completely loose and clunking. Rocking the van laterally, I can feel movement there. So far the right side is OK, but I'm nervous about it. I have contacted Raybestos. If the outcome is good, I'll add a star or two. Hopefully this is just a fluke defect.  UPDATE: After calling the number on the 24-month warranty paperwork, Raybestos sent me to someone's voicemail. I left a message and never received a call back. I called again, but opted not to leave another message. I then contacted Amazon, and being the incredibly awesome company they are, received a refund. The part isn't available through Amazon, but it's OK because I'm no longer a Raybestos customer and will be purchasing a replacement from a different company.
B001U3LZGO|5|Good
B002JFQFNA|5|for the price, can't be beat...........go ahead, make my day
B000C46QCU|1|They don't say wether it is for a ABS or non-ABS car. Those are different part numbers on a Miata. Can't risk buying the wrong part at that price.
B000NWA6T0|5|Thanks
B004RNOVTM|1|I am outside of the 30 day return, by a few weeks,  for a hose that just split at the end. Dissatisfied customer! A complete waste of money.
B00ZM9LANA|5|Very lightweight and holds so many items. Worth every cent.
B003EOU0TK|5|love it :)
B000E2ARBG|4|Great cost great product no issues for my Kz 1000
B00P9OF04I|4|My daughters 2002 Honda CRV, headlights were fogged up.  Bought this because is was cheap and had good reviews.  My only negative is actually about the use of this in conjunction with the Meguiar's DA Power System as recommended on the packaging material.  I have the DA and used it, and used it, and used it...didn't do a thing after over a half an hour.  I then shifted to the hand application and it started coming off immediately.  Kept wiping it off, re-apply and rub at right angles...worked like a champ.  I can only assume the DA Power System doesn't have the appropriate movement direction, nor enough vertical force...great for waxing, but not this.  Hand application does take some effort, its not a free ride...but it really does work, just keep repeating and wiping until you get the clarity you're looking for.  I've seen some other reviews whining about the sealant running down the light and onto the car etc...that's purely operator error.  Tape your lights, cover nearby paint and follow the directions...works as advertised.
B00VZOHVSE|3|Not bad, the only problem I have are those connector's plastic clip on the connector comes off almost everytime I unplug them, need to shake it back out.
B0031I4HK2|5|Fit a 2004 grand prix no issues saved probably 50 bucks buying from amazon
B00B5NPL7I|5|la luz es baja
B00F8UKF5C|5|Looks good on vehicle!!
B0013GF8YS|4|Still can't see my blind spots with this but I wanted it anyway.
B00J032YKW|3|Seat covers do not provide a nice, snug fit.  They bag and wrinkle and move when I get in and out of the car.  I'm disappointed considering how expensive they were.
B001U37XFG|3|Its working hasnt failed yet thats all i can say at this point. Good delivery thought would be faster with trial to prime but wasnt basic 4 to 6 day delivery
B000NCOKZQ|5|Arrived in excellent condition.
B004N5WHE0|5|Heard a lot about this product.....  Now to try it!!!
B000IHUQ5E|5|I am restoring a ford model a coupe, and needed some way to get into intricate parts to blast rust, paint, and grease. I use tractor supply fine grade coal slag. This gun is great! I have gone through about 15 50lb bags of abrasive and have done everything from axle housings to wheels to spindles, brake drums, leaf springs, and more!<br />It does run out of abrasive quick, but put the abrasive in a bucket and use a large drinking cup to pour the stuff in.<br />I would wire brush the scaly stuff off as my rolair 2.5 big would catch back up, and that helps a bunch.
B000HBNTX2|4|the best had soap for dirty hands
B001F0IE7A|5|Not real easy to mount you have to drill 16 holes but works perfectly after mounted.
B000WNRFX0|5|does what its supposed to
B00069CN2I|1|Received 2 right mirrors
B004KSJAJA|5|It's a pretty straightforward key chain with a low profile design and a cool Jeep logo.  What you see is what you get... and it works for me!
B000C5CE9I|4|Easy to install on 98 Accord.  Seems to have solved my problem with all my coolant cooking off.  I'm sure the car is much happier with a properly functioning cooling system.  Doesn't come with a gasket, so better get one unless you actually think you can recycle your old one.  (Don't do that)<br /><br />Also, if you're into that whole taking care of the environment thing or just not making a mess, you should definitely get some kind of pan/tub under the car.  Removing the coolant hose will dump some coolant, but you can prop it up and stop the flow quickly.  Opening the thermostat housing and removing the old thermostat will dump a ton of coolant all over the place.<br /><br />Hopefully, I won't have to test the &#34;failsafe&#34; feature any time soon.
B004ZQN1RO|3|It's a thermostat and it does what it's designed to do well. Nothing exceptional about it's fit or function. Seeing as it's for a VW it wasn't as easy to get to as I would have liked but that's not the Beck Arnley's problem.
B0002M9UUW|5|Just  perfect
B00J5SP6VG|5|Items were as advertised. Excellent service
B001C6N7M4|3|One made it no problem & and the other fell apart sometime during the test drive ( other parts installed at same time). Look good and mount correctly. To bad their glue didn't hold the cover and lense on. Try again, one more on order.
B00GWFOSBY|5|Just like the old ones!  It is made of heavy material, so it works well installing hub caps.
B00LB61TGQ|5|The Jacktech spring compressor work with ease when compressing rear strut springs of '06 Mazda MX-5 Miata. Easy to move around being less than 60 pounds.
B00AOGDNE0|5|Much better than the factory one.
B00B2YHFO2|5|very bright...must be turned the correct way as they do not give out light all the way around...but when they are turned correctly, they work well!
B00877SL2M|5|What a difference. They last a long time too. Still on the same set and I got plenty of spares.
B00EVQI2X6|5|Works well for the train horn.  Nice stiff spring for the momentary blast for the LOUD horn.
B003ZS32CW|5|Great price and just as good as the one you would buy from the Lexus dealership for 1/3 the cost.
B0011UINZC|5|Careful since these colors do violate some state laws according to police. But they do work very well
B001P11SCM|5|Awesome brake controller. I replaced a Reese controller with this one and the difference was night and day.
B00I7EM1K8|5|Cheaper than then name brand auto stores.
B000IYPS1E|5|Exact replacement for the fan on my 2000 Honda Civic.  Super easy to install.
B00DZ54I7I|3|Beads don't seem to reduce my sciatica pain in the car.  Probably need something to push up in that area and then it might work.
B009ECK63G|5|perfect fit
B00A3N8Y2A|5|Thought it was great!<br />Good quality for the price
B00W2MUD88|5|Very easy to install, factory ring around headlight is a little big but does not effect the installation of the light. Fast shipping! Just make sure you have a toggle switch or buy one to hook up to the halos.
B00DSD4RWS|4|Great, but too light skinned for meatwad. the lines are really nice, no jaggies or misscut edges. the white and black is nice, just the skin tone and color of meatwad are of(IMO)
B0002Q7C3A|4|Perfect
B00YVQD4A2|5|Much better than other double holders. Good quality and does excellent job. I am ordering second one for my wife.
B00KYYV6RI|5|A great high quality sticker.  It has been 4 months (May - Aug) since i put it on the car and their is no peeling or fading of color.  I definitely recommend for a daschund fan
B00150T140|2|Dismal lifetime, squash scent lasted at least 3 weeks longer than this.
B0069EQSSY|4|the antina looks good<br />have only been out twice since installed<br />reception is good , but have not been out of local area<br />easy quick installation
B003TVG2EK|1|poor quality, one side tab broke off fitting it the first time, then the engine was cutting out intermittently, removed the plug and saw that 2 of the 3 metal tangs had bent in permanently, all this from fitting it once.
B002X6VXL4|1|Air compressor doesn't work! A wanted to inflate a pool for my son and didn't work... I tried to return it and i couldn't!! I've been buyin from Amazon for a couple years and this is the first time i post a negative rating....  Disapointted!!!
B00UGDAVKU|5|Fast shipping  perfect thank you
B00CC03F30|5|Love it!!!
B000CNB3VA|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B001EOV46K|4|c
B002P94SXE|5|Arrived right on time, exactly the part I needed.
B0091U4T9I|4|Definitely Mazda part.  No issues there. Seller very good.  I agree the install isn't hard but you need two people and the &#34;TIE DOWNS&#34; are crappy.  Flimsy and not high quality.  It's also hard to screw them in without using a hex as a lever to do it.  I made a slight scratch on the roof... Kinda stinks.  Don't be deterred, anyone can install this but it's just a little harder than I anticipated.  You needs a torx screwdriver.  Directions saw flat only but not true.  You need torx.
B00IR7DYME|5|Im using these as rear brake lights and they work great, not flexible tho..but not a problem for me.
B001892TQK|3|I would give these seats a +5 stars if they were actually black denim. As others have mentioned, they are gray, not black. I have purchased two new from seats for my Jeep last year in black denim, so I purchased this new rear seat from Bestop thinking it would be close if not exact. Well let me tell you, it is not even remotely close. I am going to spray the seat with a vinyl spray to match my front seats, which irritates me because I should not have to waste my time doing this. I would send this seat back but it would be more work than spraying them. The seat is well made, but beware of the color
B0087FLURW|5|Holds the bike well, pretty easy to use and install. Takes about 5 minutes to install onto your roof, then about 1 minute to get your bike on the rack. I don't know how safe it is with a heavier bike, I'm riding a pretty lightweight road bike.<br /><br />Only gripe is the tie-down for the rear wheel can get in your way when putting your bike up on the rack, but hardly a deal breaker.
B00XB3WM7W|5|product delivered earlier than expected and was as described.
B003HB2AFM|5|Looked good, tire guy tried to take off tire by air gunning the plastic nuts! fit well.
B00065L2D8|5|A good product, at a good price.
B007V2BSG0|5|Perfect fit and keeps inside very cool. Noticeable difference right away.
B010W22HAG|5|Works as expected.
B00IN5X2P4|4|way better deal than dealership  Good fit overall
B001AWN44G|5|Great set of grips. Installed on 15 ultra limited low. Right side a little loose, but works fine. Dry fit left side and mark before adding glue. Glue sets super quick.
B006JRJ5L8|5|Great.  So nice to get a brass connection instead of those plastic ones.  Had to replace the plastic ones each season.  This should last for along time.
B00QMULSUI|5|Pleased with this product
B007ZHZ7EK|5|Great cheap and cheerful Roy 'Chubby' Brown style WW2 RAF goggles for photographic prop use; a bargain buy, excellent.
B00NFSV5LC|5|great
B0035R3XV8|5|good item
B00RB0CGHM|5|Definitely worth the money! it only took me and a friend 30 minutes to install, and fits perfectly! if you do decided to buy it make sure you buy seat belt covers or padded set belt holders, once i had them on for about 10 minutes they where scratching my neck pretty bad. but other than that this harness is probably one of the best investments iv'e purchased on amazon!!!
B00651BW50|5|great
B00XBEJZA8|5|Pros: super bright led's, included mounting brackets,  housing solid, packaged well<br /><br />Cons: brackets are chrome plated which were already flaking when I installed the light.<br /><br />**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product.
B00CQAR0Y6|4|came in quickly and fit just perfect
B000CLQPXS|3|it had a dent
B000TYOSFU|2|Not everything from China is as it should be and is a true statement for this product. The &#34;O&#34; ring suffers from poor molds. Flashing and un-round cross section plagues this seal. The rating of two stars is for the snap/retaining ring, that was ok. If it weren't for the retaining ring I would have rated this with no stars and returned the product. As it stands I'll be replacing these &#34;O&#34; rings with factory rings before winter.
B0012ZEZ8A|3|Good set for the money as far as the savings when you go to purchase these individually.  Unfortunately the tire gel cap was loose and had a light leak in the box getting on pretty much everything. Other than that its was a good package.
B004GFS2C8|5|This work great. I watched a tutorial video in the ChrisFix channel in YouTube, so I recommend that one too for you to check on a video for more information.<br />The only thing you have to consider, is that in my case, the crack was opening lines already, because I didn't do it right away, and the crack was bigger than I remembered. You should buy this since day one for better results, if you dont, you will have the issue I had, covering really well the crack but no the lines.<br /><br />Really recommended!!
B00BYX2550|4|This is a good product easy to install. Was simple to put together and put in the truck . My tuck runs smooth and strong not as much lacking for air. The Mount for the intake manifold is a little loose could be tighter. Or have a river o ring or something to make it tighter. It dose do what I expected it to do. Good and easy to install
B0049IZSS8|5|Great experience, fast deliver, totally satisfied
B001P2D3LK|5|Correct pinion seal for GM passanger 12 bolt.
B000AMOEGY|5|Good Value for the money easy to handle I would buy it again!
B010MHV00O|4|Does the job! For the Toyota Tacoma 2015 the smallest cup size was too small and the next size up was too big. There is some rubber included for this very reason but it was still not enough. So I ended up getting more rubber to make it a tighter fit. (I'm referring to the base of the unit here that goes inside your existing cup holder.)<br /><br />The only other thing I would recommend is making the top part where your cup goes in a little deeper so your cup is more secure. I have the 40 oz Hydro Flask which is tall so can be top heavy when full. When turning corners my water bottle will tilt to the side a little, but I have never had it fly out. I think making it a little deeper on top would give a little more peace of mind that it won't fall out.<br /><br />Overall great product and I would buy it again.

B00A8MZ7IA|4|Good, quality towels.
B00DQJB7EK|5|Nice little shorty antenna option for your vehicle. Looks great on any vehicle in my personal opinion.
B00EQ1VQ8Y|1|Incorrect fit on Driver side, it hits against the steering Column
B000EBKG90|5|Do the job . Easy to use.
B000A0EJ9S|5|good filter..
B00CZE5O5U|4|I gpt,a different color than I ordered and I don't know how to work the led
B0089LSMSE|5|great price on ATF DW1
B005PO9804|4|Worked well on step bumper on 1999 Ford truck that appeared white.  Also on mirrors
B000TYOS3C|5|Worked with our Chevy Silverado 2003!
B000XXZW3Y|5|Good Grips
B00859HI12|5|Great idea! The grip works great for a car or boat
B00029J3KW|5|Working perfectly
B001M6VAHS|5|Bolts too long for 99 blazer so I cut them off, filed ends and it worked.  Well worth the few bucks.
B00279F66K|5|Excellent job by Amazon to get it to me in two days on standard shipping, ordered Monday received Wednesday. Installed part on rear of Equinox,completly quieted down noise caused by the worn hub assembly .
B0002Z9QO4|5|For $30, this thing is great. It's constructed well enough, it fits across our 2010 Legacy perfectly well between the Yakima Q-Tower Roof Rack. It's likely not waterproof but seems like it could handle a little water. It has a soft bottom that seems like it would protect the roof paint, although I'm not the particular type, to be honest. If I were taking long trips - and thought I'd subject my luggage to weather - I'd bag it up inside or spend the money on a cargo box. But, for what it is, this is a good sample, I think and certainly worth the price. Used three times so far.
B00Z515O5K|5|I drive by myself a lot and wanted a set of jumper cables for those &#34;just in case&#34; moments. I did not want to be the woman that didn't have any cables when she needed these. My husband looked these over and said that these were a really nice pair. I have an older Suburban and you never know when something is going to go bad with the battery. These are a good length since my vehicle is a lot higher than most others. I have needed to be jumped a couple of times and found that there just wasn't enough length on the cables and no good way to get close enough to help. These give me the peace of mind that I have what I need in an emergency.<br /><br />I received these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.
B000EDUUH6|4|as described.
B004C0MO6W|5|We had a 2007 Honda Odyssey EX-L and we noticed the AC fans behind the radiator would only kit on when we got going fast.  This problem only occurred after the van had been sitting overnight.  So I was stumped!  After doing a little research I was told these switches sometimes malfunction and need to be replaced!! Boom, that was it, works awesome and my wife and I both believe our AC works like it is brand new.  Not only did this save us a lot of money, it worked great!  The price was also on spot at Amazon, half the cost then buying one from the locale auto parts store!
B00E63TI32|5|Really does keep liquids cold.  Looks nice, too.
B008VOMIIE|5|I don't drive a beetle, but this ladybug looks cute on my sports car.
B000BYB54A|4|Boots were correct, lengths were correct for an easy retrofit to my vehicle. Electrical resistance of one wire was significantly larger than the others, but doesn't appear to cause a misfire. No radio interference observed.
B009M9YO6G|2|I must have not paid close attention, but this is sold as ONE plate cover. When I opened the package I expected a pair. It's overpriced for just one. I couldn't return it because I moved overseas two days later, but I really wanted to.
B004301I8Q|4|Good replacement for existing lamps that are cracked and broken
B000FGECW6|4|good price.  will buy again.  works great in original holder.
B0036VUGWW|5|The Spyder &#34;SMOKE&#34; lights are great. NOT Dark so you get rear ended in the name of looking cool! Not clear so that you lose the look of tail lamps. The light output is great! Running lights at night are brighter than stock. All connections for my 2008 F-350 fit great with no modification or additional wiring. I could list daytime, blinkers, brake but they would all be great. A good buy for a tasteful update to my 8 year old truck.
B003YJJWW6|5|Way better than those plastic ones that are being replaced.
B00FWP8QBS|5|Brand new and exactly as advertised.
B00TPXAWKQ|5|Perfect fit and easy to install.The instructions were easy to follow.Looks great too.
B00S9OM0GQ|5|I love it
B003YLMQHC|5|I have a 2005 Tahoe where the high speed - # 5 - went out quite a while back.  Then about 6 months later the # 4 speed went out.  I did some research on the Tahoe Forums and determined there was really good chance this was the problem.  After removing the cover under the dash I got the part # of the old one and cross referenced with this one on the Dorman web site.  After I received it I installed and while the fan now worked on speed # 5 the # 4 speed was still not working.  I disconnected the wiring harness from the switch and noticed  that 2 of the connections in the old plug were a little discolored.  I cut the wires on the old one and replaced it with the new included plug and harness and now all 5 speeds are working as they are supposed to.
B00CKZMVV4|5|Great product
B000GU5IH4|5|Very nice motorcycle cover. I like that it covers my entire bike unlike my previous one, and I also like the front has a special cutout for your mirrors. I most definitely recommend this tone anyone looking for a motorcycle cover that is reasonably priced and will no doubt protect your bike from the environment.
B005DPCKEG|5|These didn't fade from sun or anything, very well made.
B00RTLUPVC|1|Completely fell apart before I could use it.
B00P7QIFQ8|5|as expected
B00WAORS40|5|Very satisfied
B0049MX9SA|4|It works
B0051HA0RU|4|Item was as expected and shipping was as quick.
B00AHDHM5Q|5|worked very well in my race trailer
B000FQ0DJM|5|Good replacement fits perfectly
B0006L9TM8|5|Good
B005N6WPS6|4|My wife LOVED it, but the sizes run a bit small.  Order one size larger than you normally wear.
B0080E9OH8|4|non standard base
B00RM327NG|5|This phone mount is easily one of the best phone accessories you can buy. I use this every day, and it holds my phone securely where I can see it while driving for navigational purposes. I have used it as a little stand as well, since it can prop up the phone on a table.<br /><br />This is a must-have accessory, and I have recommended it many times to friends and family. It is worth every penny and then some.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|&#34;Appears to be a quality unit. I do not have any decent quality gages to compare it against.&#34; I just compared it to a friends expensive, professional gage and they read exactly the same. I had an occasion to contact the seller and his response time was excellant!<br />I highly recommend this seller and his products to anyone wanting a great tire pressure gage.<br /><br />Robert Terrill
B00AWUCD3U|5|Went on my car the day I got them.  Doing well in the weather, and car wash.  The stickers are a tad smaller than I expected but I got more than I ordered (maybe to make up for it??).
B001O03AXY|4|Works well, but the switch for the passenger side window is very stiff.  It takes a lot of effort to push it.
B0033DOKX4|4|Great product... Fits great...one thing tho it's labeled that gasket are inside and there was no gasket in.
B000WKFB84|5|Excellent
B004KJLM18|5|I bought a dirt cheap ATC250R and quickly discovered the metal tank and filter we destroyed with rust. After two weeks of attempting to kill the rst with a vinegar treatment I threw in the towel and bought this tank. It was a good choice. The petcock mounts perfectly and it fits on the 3-Wheeler flawlessly. It's plastic, so I won't be able to attach any graphics without severe bubbles, but I will enjoy the safety of having no rust sucked into my engine!
B0056OFWVM|5|Works great for strapping kids to your roof.
B0051Y2XLY|1|Dude.didn't fit the ej or the e.g. but finagle and it works well with ef platform
B00H36XX6C|5|When I go camping I like to rough it, but I still take my cell phone.  Some time ago my wife bought me a Mophie and that gave me an extra 1 1/2 phone charges.  I get nearly 3 full charges with this NOCO Xgrid XGB3L, and I have the use of a flashlight as well.
B00Z0EEJS0|2|Bought this for my Camaro since there are no pockets on the back seats.  I've only had it for a few days and I did not even get a chance to actually put stuff inside and it already ripped apart.  The strap that goes over the seat and connects it to the bag ripped as I was just trying to adjust it  I barely tugged on it.  It is cheaply made and I doubt this can support more than a few pounds of items.  And the picture you see is misleading.  It is smaller than it looks.  And in the picture you see an umbrella hanging at the bottom of the bag--in real life, there are four loops at the bottom of the bag and they are so tiny, even the smallest umbrella cannot fit inside.  That part of the bag is big enough to hold something with the circumference of a marker.  I'm going to try and crazy glue or staple the strap back and see if I can put a few light items inside.
B009TI5B3U|1|Bought this item in April 1015 and hardly used it in my SUV.  When I went to use it today, August 15, 2015, the suction cup pulled away from the rest of the assembly rendering it useless.  Unfortunately, according to Amazon I'm beyond my timeline for returning or exchanging this product.<br />I would think carefully before buying this because of what I just experienced.
B004RCRS9I|5|Can't wait to use this on the extension pole to aide in washing the car.....
B001DCA1DK|5|Excellent fitment replaced old parts on 2008 nissan titan.
B00OPMIR2M|5|Very good does its job.
