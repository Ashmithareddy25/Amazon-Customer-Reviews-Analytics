B00004TH7Z|4.0|For those of you like me who have been an Iron Maiden fan since the beginning, you will take a couple of listens to get used to this CD.  Once you get past that, however you can't get enough.  This CD has not left my  disk player since I got it on the 9th of June.  Maiden have mixed their  classic style with that of the past 5 years very well.  This is most  evident on Brave New World, The Mercenary, and Dream of Mirrors.  These to  me are the stand out tracks although the rest of the CD is very good as  well.  I was actually very surprised at how well Adrian Smith and Jannick  Gers played guitar together (especially live, I just saw them in London on  Friday and the band still does a great show, don't miss it).  If this isn't  enough to convince you to get this disk, check out Martin Popoff's review  on Hardradio.com.  He gives a complete song by song review.
B000002N3J|5.0|When most people think of Madonna, they probably think of dance.  But this collection of ballads contains some beautiful songs, and she delivers them beautifully.  &quot;Take A Bow&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; are the two that  come to mind.  They are incredible.  I was glad to see &quot;Something To  Remember&quot; included.  It is one of her lesser-known ballads from the  I'm Breathless album.  &quot;Crazy For You&quot; was one of my favorites  from the 80's.  I love the horns.  And I really like &quot;Oh Father&quot;,  although it's kind of dark.  It always reminds me of winter, when there's  snow on the ground.  But I think the real gem on this collection is  &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot;.  I had never heard it before, and  she really belts it out.  Great track.  With Madonna in top form with Ray  Of Light, I'm sure there will be more collections like this to come.
B000003KCU|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theater along time ago and I loved it. It's a classic! I don't have this movie but you have to own it. I couldn't stop watching it when it came on TV alot it's awesome! I wonder where I can  get this movie on video it's not in stock for sale anywhere. If you hadn't  seen this movie go rent it. It's one of my favorite movies.
630407185X|3.0|An interesting production about the disaster operation Market-Garden that the allies launched against the Germans in France, 1944.  It seems the director was more concerned about the special effects and the ego of his  actors then the basic foundations of the film.  Actors like Sean Connery,  Anthony Hopkins, Max Schnell all are great, and help the movie sincerly,  but god get some spunk back into it!  All in all, the movie is very long,  overproduced, but has good historical background and acting, but should be  re-titled &quot; A Budget Too Long &quot;

0198534469|5.0|This is a large informal work devoted to making complex analysis intuitive.  There is no other book on complex analysis roughly like it.  It is roughly at the junior-senior level and of course requires a background  in calculus and preferably real analysis.  I suspect many students who have  already had the C.A. course might enjoy reading this to find out what they  should have learned.  It is a must-have for anyone interested in complex  analysis.
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks is a difficult album to describe. It's more of an experience than a collection of songs. Though only some songs stand out by themselves (Sweet Thing, The Way Young Lovers Do), they all work perfectly together as  an album. Van was going more for a mood than anything else. He could have  failed miserably; some think he has. I don't agree. Van's vocals are  extremely powerful here. The lyrics seem to have a simple structure, with  Van improvising the rest along the way, and brilliantly. The  instrumentation is simple, yet perfectly captures the mood and enhances  Van's vocals. At times beautiful (Sweet Thing) and sad (Madame George),  Astral Weeks is not for everyone, but it's certainly one of Van's best.
0767903854|5.0|I have to admit that I'm a Bryson fan. I have read nearly all his books and I've enjoyed every one, but this one was excellent. He avoided the preaching which sometimes crept into &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot;  and he seemed more at ease with himself than in &quot;A Walk in the  Woods&quot;.<br />I've never previously had a great desire to visit Oz, but  after reading this I do. I can't think of a better recommendation for the  book! His description of listening to the Australia / England Cricket match  on the radio was priceless - and I'm English and a cricket fan!<br />If you've  not read Bryson before (where have you been? ) then this is a great place  to start! <br />John
B00003CXIP|5.0|When I first saw Stand By Me, I was 12yrs old, and I fell in love with it. Two years later I read the story, &quot;The Body&quot; which the movie is based on. The story is written by the very talented Stephen King. It's  about 4 boys who go on a journey to find the dead body of a missing child.  While on their journey they encounter a junkyard dog, an exciting train  chase, and the discovery of friendship. Although, the book was better, the  movie is still a cassic that one will never forget.
0553108034|4.0|So much happens, but so little changes... A reader should beware. Reading this book without knowing what goes before is lost. A reader aware of the past would read this book and be rewarded.<br />Bleah. I can't keep writing  like that. Just in case a reader is wondering, how can George R.R. Martin  hope to write a six-book series when he kills off so many in the first two,  he adds so many new characters -- like Jaqen, the mysterious killer off to  join the Night's Watch.<br />There's much more magic in this book than the  first one, but there's an explanation (kind of), and it does little to  detract from the action and excitement and realism that does take place  (though the reader may feel cheated out of a couple of potentially  interesting battles). Medieval fighting tactics come to the fore, and the  detail is amazing.<br />As in the previous novel, there is much in the way of  battlefield tactics and palace intrigues. The &quot;smallfolk&quot; have a  greater role, as the impact of the wars ruin the lives of those powerful  and weak. Enjoy this one for the depth and the amazing characters.
078322804X|3.0|This edition includes the footage that was edited out after the initial premier of the movie.  Unfortunately, the excess footage clutters the movie and breaks the flow.  The excess footage was edited out for a reason and  putting it back significantly degrades the movie.<br />If you have never seen  this movie do yourself a favour and  buy it on VHS instead of DVD.
B00004RI87|5.0|John Garcia has created a sound with Kyuss, then changed it to more punky stoner rock with his new project Unida. There are the same fuzzy grooves kept from Kyuss, but there are also new, more intelligent jams with this  new set. The guitars, drums, and bass are all tuned perfectly, and I love  every song. This is perfect daytime stoner rock, for cruising in the van,  whereas most of the music in that genre is based around sunset in the  desert. Coming on strong with a great title, Coping With the Urban Coyote  satisfies easily. Some really cool tracks on here are &quot;Black  Woman&quot;, &quot;You Wish&quot;, &quot;If Only Two&quot;, and  &quot;Plastic&quot;. Check it out if you like Sabbath or Kyuss.
B00004T0P1|5.0|One of the finest original scores written for a Disney movie ever - and not far off one of the best of the last decade or so. period.<br />Displaying the musically literacy of such luminaries as John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith  and David Arnold, James Newton Howard not only provides great backing to  the images on the screen but can invoke their emotions purely with his  music.<br /> If Dinosaur is not nominated for Best Original Score come next  Oscer-time there is no justice in the world.
B00004D3C1|5.0|I am barely at home ever, because my job is writing for a newspaper. So I often take my life on the road in a van with my friends, and when we go, we take stoner rock along with us. As true stoner rock fans  would know, you need to crank the music up in the van loud. I bought this  while I was on a roadtrip and this was awesome when we cranked it up loud.  But when I got home it just lost its touch and wore out. The actual music  is great, but I think I hear them trying to be in the nu metal scene, but  it's not working. No matter how hard they try, they will always be stoner  metal, and that's the way we like it. On this really cool static version of  original Sabbath jams, the Manchus have really sped up their songs, and  added more polished touches. Personally, I recommend this CD to anything  and everyone, despite this not being their best (Action is Go by far). The  best songs on here are definitely Weird Beard, Grasschopper, Over the Edge,  No Dice, and Freedom of Choice. Their riffage has improved greatly and  should be recognized by people everywhere. Check this out if you're down  with Monster Magnet or the Atomic Bit*hwax (they made me bleep it out).
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia is probably one of the best Disney films ever! Classics like The Sorcerer's Apprentice will be part of Disney films forever (as evidenced by its inclusion in Fantasia 2000).
B000000W6F|4.0|Sorry, but I'm spoiled with excellent sounding CDs, and Gish, although a good album, doesn't sound good. I think that the songs would be a lot better if it were remastered, or recorded again. Well, let's get onto the  album. Gish is a heavier sounding album from the Smashing Pumpkins. . .  during the grunge days. The drumming, I have to say, is some of the best  that I've heard. Way to go Jimmy! It is a lot less polished and rawer than  the other Pumpkins album's, and so that makes it sound more grungy. <br />The  album starts out with the explosive drumming on &quot;I Am One&quot;. This  is probably the best song ont he album. . . and Jimmy does an excellent job  here. And so does everyone else. Billy's voice sounds great here (as of all  the songs). &quot;Siva&quot; is a wonderful song. . . it's one of those  songs that you don't get tired of. &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; is one of those  songs that you listen to over and over. It has a great climax to it.  &quot;Bury Me&quot; is an explosive song. . . and the guitar riffs are some  of the best I've ever heard. &quot;Crush&quot; is a pretty good song  although not a landmark song. &quot;Suffer&quot; is a different song, so  that makes me like it a lot. &quot;Snail&quot; is a pretty catchy song.  D'arcy does a great job on bass here. &quot;Fristessa&quot; is the second  best song on the album, it's a lot like &quot;I am One.&quot; &quot;Window  Paine&quot; is an okay song. Not that good, but not that bad either.  &quot;Daydream&quot; has the bassist D'arcy singing on it. She's not as  good as Billy but I think she has a good voice. <br />Well, it's a good start  for the Pumpkins. Although I think that it would be better if it were  remastered! Good goin' Pumpkins!
B00000IPAX|4.0|whats all the hype about blink 182 there's nuttin speacil bout um or their music a good CD but not worth it.
0671042858|5.0|For most SK's fans he is The King Of Horror. I do not mind, but, people,he is also a brilliant writer whose works represent a deep psychological insight into the human nature!A wide range of emotions is shown in this  book - from surprise up to desperation and your beloved horror, but it's  all done in such an astonishing way! This book is really worth reading at  least twice. Irene Andreyeva
B000003TA4|5.0|this is probably the best CD ever well maybe bot but its still awesome.
1558908358|5.0|This movie is about a couple of people who decide to go against a corrupt business man individual who obtained riches with the aid of the evil MCP-or master control program. It is the job of these computer people to put the  bad business guy out of circulation. Jeff Bridges plays Flynn, a computer  brain who decides to go against The Mcp, what happens is that he gets  zapped into the computer world by the mcp, and from there the story get  really exciting. Their is alot of action, you will see the cycles, and the  computer graphics are amazing. I also have to say that the musical score is  fantastic, Wendy Carlos does a fantastic job. This picture also includes  Bruce Boxleitner, he came out in a show called &quot;Scarecrow and  Mrs.King&quot; which aired a couple years back for a big tv network. It  also has actor of the past David Warner if i am correct. If you like the  game alot, you will like the film. This movie is a master piece, and Jeff  Bridges does an awesome performance. The only complaint I have is that he  did not get the pretty girl in the end. But it is good vs evil. Can you  just imagine if their is a part two for TRON later, Imagine JEAN CLAUDE VAN  DAMME PLAYING THE EVIL ZARK!  This movie is recommended to all who love  films.
B00003Q43A|2.0|Well, it is challenging to raise a negative voice against such a  &quot;cult&quot; movie, but I can't restrain myself. I have watched it in  1997 and still it remains one of the worst big screen blockbusters I've  ever seen (although I LOVE to watch blockbusters and sci-fi and actions  movies especially). The plot is universally known and can fit within 3  lines, the movie is full of tarnished cliches (slimy octopus-like aliens  who I don't know how can operate their flying sources, brave and courageous  pilots and soldiers in general, but usually unhappy in family life or  &quot;whose wife is just to give birth to a baby&quot;, a very cute and  young President with a dying old wife) and cheep pathos and sickly sweet  patriotism. The famouse scene of a giant UFO demolishing the White House  and surroundings is good, but when Mr President is informed that several  million people perished and he even does not blank a tear ... I think you  missed a good scene here.  It is also a pity to watch good actors  performing in such rubbish (got some good dough though, no doubt).<br />The  theme of aliens conquering Earth and after initial success receive a good  kick in the a.... from humans is eternal and it raises our self-esteem, but  I'd like to ask the guys making these movies - respect the audience, not  all of us have such bad taste or no taste at all or are kids under 12. One  of my friends, an American, said: &quot;When watching this movie, during  first hour I was proud that I'm American, after it finished - I was ashamed  that we've produced such a movie...&quot;<br />However, I would advise  everyone to watch it and decide for him/herself and see.
B000002OR4|5.0|It is impossible to describe in mere words how beautiful the violin solos on this soundtrack are.  John Williams has composed two haunting themes (&quot;Theme from Schindler's List&quot;, tracks 1 and 14, and  &quot;Remembrances&quot;, tracks 4 and 14), and Itzhak Perlman infuses his  playing with so much emotion that just listening to his violin makes you  want to cry.<br />In addition to the violin solos and the instrumental  underscoring, the album also includes several choral pieces, with a full  harmonic sound that swells to fill the room.  Williams' music, reminiscent  of traditional Jewish melodies, perfectly conveys the tensions and emotions  of this heart-breaking movie.  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a perfect  example to demonstrate the range of John Williams' talent; not only has he  given us such memorable themes as Indiana Jones, E.T., and of course Star  Wars, but he is also capable of reaching deep into his soul and producing  such heart-wrenching music as this.
B00003CWTI|1.0|This is only a kids way to see &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (which, by the way,  was heavily overrated as well). After having seen this and having read  several reviews of it before seeing it, I was puzzled to say the least. I  search my memory to find a more overrated film but I fail to find one. Not  one single theme in the film is treated with any depth. The actors are all  terrific in their handed roles but the roles themselves are idiotic. If  this is the way people are in America, then indeed: &quot;God Bless  America&quot;. But it isn't. The only role that was half believable was the  male role of the nurse of Jason Robards. Don't waste Your time with this  one: It's phony, phony, phony!!! The frog-rain in the end is good but it  won't save the movie. The star above is for that rain.
B0000062Y2|3.0|Norman Jewison's vision of Andrew Lloyd Webber's &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; was unfortunately saddled with Texan drummer Ted Neely playing/singing the role of Jesus Christ. Anyone who's heard the original  1970 recording is used to Ian Gillian's passionate, firebreathing Jesus.  Neely's performance, in contrast, is incredibly frustrating. He whines. He  simpers. He halts. His voice is comparatively flat and bland (with the  exception of his take on &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, but by then it's far too  late).<br />The movie soundtrack redeems itself somewhat with Carl Anderson's  performance as Judas. I loved Murray Head's performance in the original,  but Anderson's voice is fantastic. Unlike Neely, Anderson seems to  *understand* the role he's playing, and tailors his singing  accordingly.<br />From a flawed movie comes a flawed soundtrack. The movie  soundtrack contains two songs not on the original concept recording  (&quot;Could We Start Again, Please?&quot; and &quot;So We Are  Decided&quot;), but it's debatable as to whether or not the bonus materials  outweighs the almost painful performance by Neely.<br />If I had to choose one  JCS, it would be the original. The songs are great, but the performances  are worlds apart.
B00000K19E|5.0|Don't let Yourself get fooled by the 'special effects'. They are just a  pretence in order to get the kids to see this movie. This movie is about  the phony world we live in and one man's attempt to break into reality. It  belongs to the bravest productions made in recent years along with 'They  Live' by John Carpenter and 'Wag the Dog' by Barry Levinson. A weak point  is the use of 'artificial intelligence' being the 'bad guy'. Replace that  with 'technocrats' and You will not be disturbed by it. Our world is phony,  You better believe it!
0684874350|5.0|The first time a read this book makes me cry... and laugh, because is extraordinary, is &quot;so real&quot;, that you can feel it, I mean, feel the pain, the hungry, the fear. It's so incredible, they were just kids,  and you can see all these awfull things trough the one kid's eyes. It's so  emotional,I just can say Thanks, Mr. McCourt for sharing a little piece of  your incredible life with us.
B000002UA0|5.0|If only Syd Barrett hadn't left Pink Floyd!  Imho, their later, highly-acclaimed stuff like Dark Side and The Wall is mediocre at best, and doesn't have the tension that keeps this album alive.  Although I wish the CD still had &quot;See Emily Play&quot; and placed &quot;Interstellar  Overdrive&quot; at the end like the American-release record, the addition  of &quot;Flaming&quot;, &quot;Bike&quot;, and &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;  certainly makes up for the loss.  True, some of the music here is flawed,  but it's always interesting.  The album will grow on you, and it's a must  for anyone interested in experimental British psychedelia--but don't buy it  if you're a fan of 70's Floyd.
6305313687|5.0|American History is chilling story about a skinhead Derek (Norton) who is sent to prison for killing two blank gang members. During his incarceration he is subjected to the brutal ways of prison society. In the prison laundry  Derek meets a fellow black inmate who has no ill-feeling towards Derek's  racist beliefs and helps Derek change his attitudes towards other people.  Overtime, Derek begins too see the damage racism has brought to himself and  his family. Unfortunately Derek's younger brother is heading towards the  same path Derek took. Derek is determined too stop his brother and faces  his former gang and mentor.<br />American History should be shown to all high  school kids because the movie has such a strong message. The part of the  movie that struck me was Derek's family. His family was emotionally and  morally bankrupt by the past racism inflicted by Derek's deceased father  and Derek himself. Ed Norton's portrayal as a young racist was chilling and  convincing. You could feel his rage and hatred towards society and  minorities in general. I thought Ed Norton deserved an Oscar, however the  academy gets weak knees about issues such as racism. I would recommend this  movie...
B00004STPT|5.0|This cd is worthy of being listened to over and over again. It's very exiting and the brasses and vocals are superb.  This is an outstanding cd.
B00003CXDU|4.0|My wife, being a good natured gal, agreed to go see GALAXY QUEST with me.  Neither of us are hard-core trekkies, but I grew up watching Capt Kirk order &quot;fire proton torpedoes&quot; and &quot;set you phasers on  stun&quot; enough times to want to see what this show offered.<br />Both of us  were truly surprised.  Much to her chagrin, my wife agreed that she  actually enjoyed the film a great deal.  As for myself, I seldom laugh out  loud while watching a movie -- this movie broke that trend.  There were  several laugh out loud scenes in the movie for both of us.  I bet there  will be for you, too.<br />As for the show itself, it is, of course, a spoof  on the original &quot;Star Trek.&quot; The movie has a somewhat slow start,  but that segment is essential to setting up the rest of the show.  Once the  show gets moving, though, there is plenty of good fun for everyone.  Maybe  the reason I enjoyed it so much is that I went to see it with fairly low  expectations -- was I ever surprised!  <br />Tim Allen does a great job as the  Kirk-like captain of a long off the air sci-fi show, and his supporting  cast does a grand job as well.  <br />Join in the fun as this rag-tag cast of  TV has-beens get hooked up with a civilization of naive aliens who are in a  world of hurt.  Can the crew of GALAXY QUEST help them?  Save them?  Tune  in and see.<br />Good special effects, a funny script, and a cast that clicks  makes for a wonderful experience from this surprising entry into the sci-fi  genre.<br />OK, so, with that glowing recommendation, why only 4 stars instead  of five?  It is definitely worth 5 stars for the crowd who grew up watching  the original Star Trek, for people who are current trekkies, and for those  who enjoy good situation comedy.  This movie is not, however, for everyone.   There is a good supply of corniness involved, and those who never did like  Star Trek and similar shows should probably look elsewhere for their next  viewing option.<br />You never know though...YOU JUST MIGHT LIKE IT!<br />4  stars, not quite making it to 5.<br />Worth a Saturday afternoon or an open  week day night.<br />Alan Holyoak
0684833395|5.0|Having recently read and greatly enjoyed Herman Wouk's &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; and Hemingway's &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, I expected &quot;Catch-22&quot; to be a straightforward war novel.  Boy, was  I wrong, and pleasantly surprised!  <br />There are two sides to the style of  &quot;Catch-22&quot;.  On one hand, the character profiles and the bits of  dialogue showing how the characters interrelate are hilarious.  Heller's  prose is as funny as P.G. Wodehouse's and even his wry style of humor is  very similar to Wodehouse's.  But Heller is not using humor to lighten the  mood of war, nor is &quot;Catch-22&quot; merely humorous.  The other side  of the novel is its realistically gory portrayal of the atrocities of war  (some of which are even the result of &quot;friendly fire&quot;), including  detailed accounts of the sights, sounds, and terrors of flying in a World  War II bomber aircraft.  <br />Rather than present the plot in a linear,  chronological fashion,  Heller cleverly and innovatively cuts it up like a  jigsaw puzzle and lets the reader put the pieces together.  Only towards  the end of the novel, relating Yossarian's sadness at the news of Nately's  death and the events that follow, does the plot start to proceed a little  more conventionally until Yossarian makes his final decision to escape his  predicament.<br />If the novel has a theme, I'm going to go out on a limb and  say that it's about the evils of rationalization; that is, the way people  interpret and twist the logic and laws of authority or society to their own  advantage.  People's desire for power, status, and money results in excuses  for military brutality and endangering the lives of others, and  &quot;Catch-22&quot; illustrates numerous examples.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|ABSOLUTELY.  I've been waiting anxiously for 7 years for this CD, even more so after acquiring Morten's &quot;Wild Seed&quot;.  I knew there was more amazing music left inside the super-talented members (yes, ALL of  them) of a-ha.<br />I don't know what to say about this album that hasn't been  stated in the glowing reviews below, but I just wanted to chime in with the  praise.<br />Morten's voice - as always - is superb, encouraging me to just  sit with my eyes closed, absorbing the pure beauty of sound.  I love that  at least a couple of his songs made it onto this album, because I feel he  is a talented songwriter, if given the chance to show it.<br />Paul's lyrics  and music - as much a-ha's signature as Morten's voice - are back, and  hopefully he can get past his own hang-ups about Morten as the frontman and  just enjoy the band being back together, making great music.<br />Mags even  gets one of his own songs, like he did only once before, on &quot;Memorial  Beach,&quot; and it shows that he is definitely the most overlooked member  of the trio.  He and Paul make a great writing team.<br />I can't say whether  this is my favorite of all their CD's, because I have had years to listen  to them over and over, and create memories and associations with them - but  this CD is amazing in its own right, and deserving of serious recognition  here in the States. (Which it won't get.)<br />Please, don't write off a-ha  because you only remember &quot;Take on Me&quot; every time they play it  during 80's flashbacks.  Take a chance on this album, and discover the  fascinating musical chameleon that is a-ha.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam does it again! Binaural is one of there best records ever! This cd gives you awsome tracks like, &quot;light years&quot; &quot;nothing as it seems&quot; &quot;rival&quot; &quot;parting ways&quot; &quot;God's  dice&quot; and a whole lot more. I listening to this cd for the first time  I was suprised how much PJ has matured. You don't hear a song like  &quot;Blood&quot; or &quot;not for you&quot; on this album, it's a lot more  calm. If you don't like quiet and loud PJ than your not a true fan. This cd  kicks a$$ and I hope that if you purchase it you will like it as much as I  do!           LONG LIVE PEARL JAM!
B000002H33|5.0|I love this album.  Not a single weak track on it.  From speedy, heavy, thoughtful songs like &quot;Battery,&quot; &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; and Disposable Heroes,&quot; to the slow, methodic and heavy songs like  &quot;Sanitarium&quot; and &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be.&quot;  &quot;Orion&quot; is one of the greatest instrumental songs out there.  As  is &quot;Call Of The Ktulu.&quot;  A must own for about any rock/metal fan.
B000002J1S|5.0|I was a college student when I first heard 'The Lamb'. I am a big fan of the Peter Gabriel Genesis and thought that Foxtrot was thee album of the era.Until I heard 'the lamb'. Of course it was in the same league as  YES(how could they play like that), King Crimson, Jimmie Hendricks'and the  Band of Gypsy's and the Allman Brothers(with Duane Allman). I saw a lot of  them live (somewhere). I lived 10 miles from NYC and one town away from  Passaic NJ and the Capital Theater. The Lamb was the album that expanded  the Genesis sound and experience as far as it could go. There was no where  else for the group to go musically and I was not surprised to see Peter  Gabriel leave Genesis after this album. The music was inspired  and the  overdubbing of music and sounds supports the otherworld story of Raul.  It  is a brilliant piece of music and a standard with which I gauge all of rock  music. Many people I meet, never heard of the album or the previous Genesis  recordings , but have heard of the second generation of Genesis(Phil  collins group). That is a shame. There is no comparing the two eras.   The  Lamb took music so far out that it took at least fifteen years to catch up.  People still do not know how to classify this album. And That is fine with  me. The music delivers that message with every listen....just look around.  'Raul imperial aeresol king' has covered our properties and public spaces  with their messages, and we have turned it into one more commodity in  our'Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging'.  Peter Gabriel and Genesis had a  peak through the curtain when they work this story up.<br />Thank you Peter G.  and Genesis for that!  Give it a listen when you can sit quitely and listen  to it all the way through.
B000002H2H|4.0|I like almost every song on this album.  The only exception is I think &quot;Escape.&quot;  Other than that song, each song on here is a piece of history.  It must be bought and listened to many a time.
0060930187|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and opened me to all of Sylvia Plath's work and life.This book was perfectly written and opened you to the little things that others may see and the thoughts you would think you only  thought.                           Sylvia's struggle to write a novel, seem  not to exist as we read this autobiographical book of her struggles and her  descent into madness. As you read you feel Esther and her awkwardness and  you do really get touched by her and survive even if Sylvia didn't. This  book also deals with frustration, men, writing, sadness, and depressing  luck even though it seemed to be good.                          All I have  to say is this is a must read!
B00003CXIP|5.0|I can't remember if this movie was nominated for an Oscar, but the fact that it didn't even WIN one is enough for me to yell out: &quot;ROBBERY!&quot;.  I mean, come on.  STAND BY ME is a glorious look  into the lives of four adolescents who don't leave such glorious lives.   Gordy Lunchance is a kid living in the shadow of his dead brother and  ignored almost completely by his parents; Chris Chambers is an abused kid  with a bad reputation around town; Teddy Duchamp's abusive father is in a  mental institution but Teddy keeps the idea that his father was a terrific  war hero alive; and Vern . . . well, he's a pudgy kid.  What keeps them  going is each other:  their days hanging out in their treehouse, card  games, cursing, normal guy stuff.  They don't have much to do, since the  town they live in (Castle Rock) is pretty boring . . . up until Vern asks  them if they want to see a dead body.  From there, the boys embark on a  little journey to find the body and find out a little bit more about  themselves than they thought they would expect.<br />Is it the music that  makes people feel terribly sad at the end?  I don't know.  But really, by  the end of this flick, you'll either be in tears or close to it.  It's one  of those &quot;you'll laugh, you'll cry&quot; movie.  The performances are  terrific from each of the four boys, and it's kind of sad to think that  Pheonix wasted his life on drugs.<br />I'm a little tired now so I can't say  much of this movie but really, it's great, go watch it.  Good night.
6303148352|5.0|This movie is spieldbergs greatest masterpiece. While Schindlers List may be his best movie on story, this is far better. The story is very simple and with a movie about dinosaurs rampaging how complex could it be in the  first place? The effect may not be as overwhelming on the small screen, but  considering the power of this movie it shouldnt take long before you are  engulfed in it. This is in no means a classic based on deep and riveting  story line like the above mentioned schindlers list. It is more of a  classic because of the extremely high entertainment factor based of  effects, and the fear that is conveyed from the actors to you. I remember  when this first came out I was about 9 and I saw it 24 times in the  movies(seriously), and it still hasn't lost any of it's magic.
0679428887|4.0|As a lover of history, I found this book to be quite disturbing (in a good sense).  It is fast paced (I finished it in two nights)and offers the reader a good look into the past as well as the present while being wrapped  around a scary fictional scenerio. The author does a great job of  introducing the story and leading you through the twists and turns of a  tortured modern Russia that refuses to let go of its communist, dictatorial  past.  Again this book comes to a disturbing sequence of events (one that  is probably not out of the question in today's Russia) that will leave you  both highly satisfied in the book and deeply disturbed at the attitudes of  Russia.
B00003CWN3|5.0|This film is so incredible, but it's impossible to put the feelings into  words.  Terrible and amazing all at once.  Boys Don't Cry has the love and  tragedy of any classic love story, only amplified to a higher caliber.   While Brandon Teena's story is violently disturbing, it is also a lesson in  true love.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|I didn't see this movie at the theatre because of the way it was being marketed...which appeared to me as nothing more than a bunch of men beating the crap out of each other!<br />Once I finally saw the movie, I realized that  this doesn't even begin to explain the plot.  A truly terrific movie with  enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Edward Norton does a  wonderful job of portaying a &quot;lost soul&quot; out of place in today's  society.  Brad Pitt is wonderful in a performance that could have been so  easily over the top.<br />This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a  long time.  It gets away from your standard cliched movies which seem to  simply rehash plots older than movies themselves (for example...Gone in 60  Seconds...I don't think this movie had one original line or thought).  Even  if you think you know what Fight Club is about, you don't.  I think the  studios did a poor job marketing this film.  It should appeal to anyone who  truly enjoys something different.
B00004RFFS|4.0|Interview with the Vampire is an awesome movie.  If you have seen it before this disc is worth having and if not I would highly recomend it.  But videophiles beware...this movie brings out one of the only flaws  associated with mpeg encoding on DVD's.  When the the picture is dark it  has a tendancy to look very &quot;digital&quot; on DVDs.  Needless to say  this is a vampire movie and many of the picturs are dark.  Many people wont  notice this, but if are picky and look for stuff like that, it tends to get  a bit annoying.  Otherwise it is great, both the Dolby and the DTS  soundtracks are great.  Hope you all enjoy.
B000002HRE|4.0|It hurts to give a Metallica album a 4. But this album is still good. &quot;Fuel&quot;-&quot;Unforgiven 2&quot; are excellent songs. But things start to get bad from &quot;Better than you&quot; to &quot;Where the Wild  Things Are&quot;. But then comes &quot;Prince Charming&quot; which is a  pretty good song. But &quot;Low Man's Lyric&quot; has got to be one of the  greatest slow Metallica songs, and has powerful lyrics.  &quot;Attitude&quot; and &quot;Fixxxer&quot; are both great speed metal  songs. With the exception of a few fillers this is a great album.

6305750750|4.0|Take a deep breath and repeat after me: This is not STAR WARS... this is not STAR WARS... Om...  this is not STAR WARS....<br />Okay, now try these also: this is not EMPIRE STRIKES BACK... Om... this is not RETURN OF THE  JEDI...<br />So many people have come to this movie with the most irrational  expectations imaginable, from the shameless marketing of the products  disappearing that is as synonymous with George Lucas as freakin' RONCO, to  it having a DUTY to outdo not just one of the greatest movies of its kind  of all time, but in the context of people who had not only seen it 128  times but have studied it as much as Lucas himself.  Why do this?  I knew  at the outset that nothing could ever possibly outdo the emotions of the  nine year old boy I was in 1977, who sat in a movie theater watching a  movie influenced by the mythological perspective of Joseph Campbell  unfolding with special effects that changed the course of movie history  forever. For starters, I'm not nine anymore; it's like comparing your  Grandmother's Thanksgiving day turkey when you were six to your wife's on  your first one together as a couple!<br />With that said, perhaps that's why I  enjoyed it so much more than so many others.  Not to say there weren't  holes in the plot, particularly around the evolution of the young Darth  Vader's relationship with the Jedi, and yes, Jajar Binks (sp?) was  annoying.  But the movie was so much fun, and all and all, once I released  the expectations of a fashionably cynical, oh so experienced adult, and  took on the open mindedness of MY son (who ironically enough, was nine  years old when I first took him), I enjoyed it immensely.  The story and  the entire anthology is well served.  the special effects are (what do you  expect?) dazzling.  It is worth owning.  Complete your  collection, and  just have a ball.
6302914205|3.0|Twin Peaks was already losing steam long before the 20thepisode [but]I couldn't help but watch to see where Lynch would go with it.  Lynch's murder mystery  started off with a terrific bang that created so much interest you couldn't  help but continue watching.  The last episodes tend to be a bit over the  top, but it is worth watching atleast once.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I think that Fantasia by Disney is an incredible and magnificant musical movie because it mix the great music (tchaikoski) whith a  spectacular images created by Disney.
6302913896|3.0|Twin Peaks is undoubtably a whodunnit masterpiece, with plot twists and intriguing characters at every turn.  I enjoyed the originality and suspense of the first 5 episodes, however, by episode 6 the bizarre world  that Lynch created was just too much to take.  What was once intriguing  becomes a redundant bore.  By episode 9 you are more than ready for the  series to be over with and the loose ends to be tied up.
B000002JSV|5.0|Simply AC/DC at their bluesy best  A very underated release at the time. I think this is the best they have ever done.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Affimation is one of my absolute favorite CDs.  It is one of those rare albums that you can listen to straight through and love every single song.  My personal fave is 'Crash and Burn'.  That song alone makes this CD worth  buying.  On top of that you have the gorgeous love song 'Hold Me', and the  great percussion sounds of 'The Animal Song'.  Savage Garden has such a  unique sound that I absolutely love.  Buy this CD-you will definately not  regret it!
B000002MTU|2.0|This, like many EC Cds after 1978, lacks a soul...I think that Backless was that last great EC CD (excluding Journeyman) and Eric should focus back on his passion more than his speed....Get either &quot;Blues&quot;,  &quot;Crossroads 2&quot;, or &quot;EC WAS HERE&quot; for some great EC  blues stuff.
0792844890|4.0|Probably one of Mel's best works to date (with the exception of History of the world and Blazing Saddles), this movie is a definite purchase.  I was only about 8 or 9 when I saw this movie the first time (its fairly old).  Don't even read the rest of these reviews if you are a fan of Brooks, just  buy the movie.
6305076626|5.0|So maybe this isn't exactly award-winning material. So what? &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; isn't meant to be some uptight, emotional, stuffy piece; in fact, it  goes out of its way to be just the opposite. It's a satirical  piece that makes plays on corny sci-fi late night flicks, drippy musicals,  and corny Frankenstein-type horror [ex. Doctor Frank N. Furter, for  example?] <br /> The movie is packed with get-up-and-dance rock tunes,  overdone acting that seems just right, and a wildly ridiculous plot. Tim  Curry is simply brilliant; from his authoriative-yet-plaintive cries of  &quot;Oh Rocky!&quot; to his flashy and utterly corny performance of  &quot;Sweet Transvestite.&quot; The best scene for me is right after he  transduces Janet, Brad, Doctor Scott, Rocky, and Columbia, sighing heavily,  &quot;It's not easy having fun...even smiling makes my teeth ache..&quot;  before biting his finger in melodramatic anguish. Other good performances  include that of Susan Sarandon, who scores high as the naive and  inexperienced yet curious Janet. <br /> &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; isn't for  everybody. Some may write it off as &quot;sick&quot; while others may view  it as pointless. True, it took me a while to realize the whole point of the  movie and piece together bits of the plot for myself, but this movie is all  in good humor. So, to all you people out there who <BR>a) refuse to see  &quot;Rocky&quot; after hearing 5 or 6 people complaining about its  disgusting content <BR>b) have seen it once and, after deciding that it was  &quot;pointless,&quot; and turned the movie off immediately... <br />This I  say to you...<BR> &quot;Maybe Rocky Horror isn't really to blame. So, I'll  remove the cause..... But NOT the symptom!&quot;
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen has created a very believable world in  P&amp;P. Although the book's official theme is marriage, it is also a statement on human behavior. The problems suffered by the characters are the result of their  own folly, and no one else. The love story woven into the book is also  wonderful, as it shows the characters concerned getting to know each  other's positives and negatives before committing, instead of simply  jumping into bed as the characters of modern novels do. This book is  smartly written, with much humor. It is lighthearted and easy to read,  although it was written over 200 years ago (the first draft of the book was  written in the late 1700s, but not published until after 1800). I highly  recommmend it to a reader of any age. It is, as Elizabeth Bennet would say,  a &quot;happy thought, indeed.&quot;
0425170349|4.0|This book is developed around John Clark and his son-in-law Chavez. Clark is head of a SAS type international team to counter terrorist. Book as usual is well written. The ultimate threat, beyond normal reaason and grand  in scale. But fully plausable. Though enjoyable and action packed, I miss  Jack Ryan.
0783117388|5.0|I'm a law student at GWU (go big blue!) and all my friends and I gather every Sunday to watch Sex and the City. It's without a doubt the funniest and most intelligent show ever written! Sarah Jessica Parker is the most  unassuming and unaware sex symbol ever, and that just makes her even more  appealing! So coy! Petite and beautiful blonde Kim Catrall is the cat's  meow, and the other two women round up a beautiful, talented cast. But it's  the writing---and what writing! ---that keeps me coming back. Boy, have I  learned a lesson or two about the finer sex! This Cliffe brother of Clinton  NJ is hooked by their claws, and is begging for more!
B00004RFDW|5.0|I just saw this movie on video for the first time...and I'm wondering...why didn't it get more mainstream press and a huge publicity campaign?<br />After all is said and done, I believe this film will rank among  the top 100 of all time for several reasons.<br />1)The story is compelling  and gives the public a glimpse into the true power structure of our  country.<br />(2) The writing is excellent. The movie's characters are  highly intelligent people with great communication skills.  The writers did  a marvelous job in getting this fact across to the audience.<br />(3)Pacino's  work should be required research material for anyone who wants to act OR be  a journalist.  He's at the top of his game here.<br />(4)The 60 Minutes  Interview was the beginning of the end for big tobacco.  Twenty years from  now, that interview will be remembered as one of the most important events  in corporate history.<br />This is a great film on a lot of levels.<br />Enjoy!
0805053883|5.0|If we were to list our son's top five favorite books, Eric Carle's would make up 3-4 of them.  Our son loves Polar bear and Brown bear because they are interactive and fun.  The illustrations are excellent, and he never  tires of hearing the stories.
B000023X9W|5.0|This is a new fave in my collection - an absolute necessity!  This man rivals Bob Dylan in catchy, well-written mellow songs. This collection follows the mix and style that worked so well for Neil on &quot;Harvest  Moon&quot;, which is another masterpiece. &quot;Buffalo Springfield  Again&quot; sounds so smooth and hopeful. I highly recommend this CD, and  from the looks of it, ROLLING STONE is right on board as well!
0060977264|5.0|An incredibly romantic book.  Short and sweet but it will certainly have you weeping. A great love story by a great writer.  Full of spiritual tones with an unexpected ending that leaves you thinking and feeling good.
0786915749|5.0|it was an excellent book. great intro to the series. i recommend it highly
B00003W8NM|5.0|The first time I saw this film, I was mentally stunned... staggering, shaking my head, and blinking my eyes to make sure I was awake.  Every critic that lambasted this film should be shamed... because obviously they  didn't really watch the film or they failed to grasp the layered content.   The film attempts to attack your pysche with subversive images and concepts  that are explored through the mind of a mentally ill character.  It does  not glorify violence... it does not offer violence as a means to solve  problems... it does not validate male aggression - at least it is social  commentary in the tradition of A Modest Proposition and at most it is high  art.  Director Fincher uses rich visual cues and subliminal techniques that  seap into your conciousness. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite  directors.  Brad Pitt and Edward Norton deliver dynamic performances that  they trully enjoyed delivering.  Buy the special edition DVD and listen to  the commentary throughout the film.  This special feature suits this film  very well and the information shared by the director and stars is  fascinating.  I thoroughly enjoy watching this film over and over again and  hope that you will too.
B00004THAY|1.0|I would have thought that two titans of the business such as Clapton and King could produce an amazing album without even trying. I was wrong. This album makes me think of two old geezers glued to their rocking chairs  trying to recall the good old days but not even having the energy to take  their memories seriously. The title song &quot;Riding with the King&quot;  is an embarrassment. Save your money and your memories of who these guys  used to be.
0425129586|5.0|I just read this book for my summer reading program!  It was the BEST book I've ever read.  I kept thinking about the murderers and I was always wrong.  This was the first Agatha Christie book and I will most definetly  be reading more of her books.  She makes you think of different things that  never end up to be true so you're always in suspence!  Definetly read this  book!
B00004SCX6|1.0|I thought that this entire CD was empty sounding. All the pop beats with the exception of Oops, Stronger, and Lucky's beats didn't flow with her voice and it sounded consistantly like something was missing. It didn't  have the strong harmonies of N SYNC or the BSB, and it also didn't match  it's beat with the heavy pop beat with say Jessica Simpson's I Think I'm In  Love (although I am dissapointed the she got the opening to Jack and Diane  in that song). All in all I was dissapointed and thought she could have  done a lot better, since the pop beats were mediocre and the ballads were  terrible.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This film is one of my favorites of recent times.  It makes you think, makes you think some more, then it drives you nuts trying to figure out how something this good came from a sitcom writer.  On a side note, Wes Bentley  went to the local school system here, yet the never mentioned it in the  local paper.  Strange due to the fact that this is a small town that has  yet to produce a celebrity.
B0000047CX|5.0|MMMmmmmm, what an album.  I heard this as a young child in the early 60s, and rediscovered it in the 90's. The music transcends age, gender, race and dare I say it, even musical barriers with its smooth rhythms and seductive  sound.  A 40-something woman with classical/jazz/pop taste, I shared this  with an 18-year-old male friend with techno/house taste and he immediately  fell in love with it.  This album is a must for any jazz as well as bossa  nova fan.
078322804X|5.0|The video looks good and the audio transfer to Dolby 5.1 is very well done.<br />The extra scenes are actually in the movie, rather then just as clips at the end (like Alien).<br />If you like the VHS version, I would  recommend this DVD edition.
B00000JFBN|5.0|This 1997 compilation CD of the finest Sarah Brightman recordings of Lloyd Webber songs should stand as a near-definitive songbook anthology for serious and casual fans of the composer's music, and one of its finest interpreters. Although the recordings here are collected from Brightman's two Lloyd Webber anthologies, \\"Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber\\" and \\"Surrender\\", this collection treads the middle ground between these two anthologies. Brightman shows herself to be in full command of this material, with the most austere instrumental backings, and her voice really sounds like a gauzy angel of music. She sings a wide range of Lloyd Webber songs, mixing a range of well-known songs with less-familiar ones, and wraps her velvety voice around each of them, and gives them intelligent renditions.<br />As mentioned before, Brightman's collection includes four excperts from Phantom. This is not surprising, since she created the role of Christine in the world-premiere performance. Brightman's ravishing duet with Cliff Richard on \\"All I Ask of You\\" is included here, together with her soaring solo recordings of \\"Music of the Night\\" and \\"Wishing you were Somehow Here again\\". Her pleasurable duet with Michael Crawford on the Phantom's title-song shows up here, for the first time in a Brightman-Lloyd Webber anthology, and it is a sheer delight, far removed from the abominable duet version with Steve Harley. Sarah also sings two excerpts from Aspects of Love, where she sang the role of Rose as part of the London and New York productions. Apart from her rueful version of the hit song \\"Anything but Lonely\\", she gives us a wonderful, mellowed version of the anthemic \\"Love Changes Everything\\" in the superior version from her \\"As I Came of Age\\" album. And I almost forgot to mention her melting reading of the \\"Pie Jesu\\" from the Lloyd Webber Requiem, where she duets beautifully with boy soprano Paul Miles Kingston.<br />Besided the songs associated with the musicals that were created withBrightman in mind, she gives us fresh readings of two Evita songs, \\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\\" and \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall.\\" Although different from the cast recording versions, Brightman still sings these two songs with a keen understanding of Lloyd Webber's work. Brightman also shines in the two songs from Tell Me on a Sunday included here. She gives a heartbreaking rendition of \\"Tell Me on a Sunday\\" and a jaw-breaking rendition of the \\"Unexpected Song\\". You can imagine how your jaw would drop at the full-throated high note at the very end. The surprise, however, are the three excerpts from CATS. Sarah gives us a fresh version of the badly-abused Memory (gosh, you can be thrilled by the high notes she hits on that one), and also a sassy and saultry rendition of the jazzy \\"Macavity\\" that sounds better than on the cast recordings. She also duets with the late Sir John Gielgud on \\"Gus: the Theatre Cat\\" and sings it tenderly, like Bonnie Simmons on the original Broadway cast recording. Brightman may not have sung any major role of CATS at all, but yet this recording convinces you how superbly she sings these three excerpts.<br />It is a pity, though, that in these 66 minutes, this collection didn't include Sarah's tender readings of \\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\" from Jesus Christ Superstar and the title song from Whistle Down the Wind. It is an even unfortunate pity that her touching rendition of the the neglected song, \\"Half a Moment\\" from By Jeeves, was not included here, to contrast with the well-known songs. But yet, Sarah gives a worthwhile overview of Lloyd Webber's career between Evita and Aspects of Love.<br />All-in-all, though, all things considered, this is definitely a worthwhile compilation of Lloyd Webber songs from one of its finest interpreters. This is a thoroughly recommendible recording on all counts for both beginners and connoiseurs alike, covering a wide cross-section of Lloyd Webber songs.<br />One last personal note: I wonder whenReally Useful Group and Decca will allow for a release of Sarah's complete Andrew Lloyd Webber recordings to be released in a 2-CD set, complete with 24-bit remastering, lavish packaging, and rare gems such as \\"Half a Moment\\" and \\"Whistle down the Wind\\"? There surely is substantial demand for a complete 2-CD Brightman-Lloyd Webber songbook.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Well, I started to like Creed when I heard &quot;Higher&quot; on the radio. I liked the idea of uplifting hard rock. I am amazed by Creed. They have proved that hard rock and good lyrics can mix. If you want a good hard  rock cd without swearing get &quot;Human Clay.&quot;
0783117388|5.0|This set makes an interesting collection because you get to see the show SEX AND THE CITY develop it's own style over the first season.  The first couple of episodes were directed by Susan Siedelman (of DESPERATELY SEEKING  SUSAN fame).  Her style was very documentary -- characters spoke to the  screen as if being interviewed, and the editing was a little more choppy.  Also, for the first 6 or 7 episodes the shows are centered around Candace  Bushnell's book of the same name.  Infact, a lot of the dialogue is even  lifted VERBATIM from the printed version.  But then something interesting  happens...the show develops a stride all its own.  The production values  get lusher, the characters get deeper, and the show becomes what is today  -- a glossy and smart half hour about characters who are looking to connect  with the opposite sex.  You go from high comedy (the modelizers and  &quot;having sex like men&quot;) to touching drama and tragedy (Carrie's  failed attempts to get Big to open up to her).  Wonderful stuff!  You need  to own this collection, because revisiting the shows is an absolute joy!
6303477259|5.0|I have had the pleasure of seeing Pink Floyd twice and would pay any price, if another tour opened up. I was raised by a 1st generation PF fan (father) who saw the Animals tour in 76. Unfortunately some idiot threw a  package of firecrackers on the stage and the show ended early. My father  and I saw them in 87 (Momentary Lapse of Reason). I saw them in 94 after  Division Bell was released. I actually purchased the video elsewhere, but  would have purchased it at Amazon, had I found it there first. It felt like  Christmas when I go home to play it. I saw it with my son, who is now 13.  Then with my wife. Then my Dad. I almost felt like I was in a time capsule.  You never forget a great concert and PF by far has the patent on  synchronizing the audio visual. I just hope that they have 1 more tour in  them. I would love to return with my son.<br />All in all, an exceptional  piece. The only problem I have is understanding why it is not offered on  DVD.

0140157352|5.0|Rarely does one find a book that has so much applicability and also speaks with so much clarity. It's a &quot;How to&quot; book about negotiating, a skill that virtually everyone in life employs on a daily basis. You learn  simple concepts that you can apply while getting some good anecdotal  backbone that makes it very read-able. Those interested/working in politics  and/or law will find it &quot;up their alley&quot; - but everyone would  benefit from a read. I would put this book in there with the likes of  &quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot;, &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence  People&quot;, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; and probably the ubiquitous  &quot;Seven Habits...&quot; - a group of works which all just teach you how  to be a stellar human being. Well, gives you a map anyway, you have to walk  the path yourself. Of course I'm still walking...
B000005JXG|5.0|As a longtime Pogues fan I can only say &quot;WOW&quot; when I put &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace...&quot; in the CD player.  I had the good fortune to meet Liam Clancy of the Clancy Brothers once and while  talking with him over a cup of tea I mentioned my affection for the Pogues  to which he replied... &quot;The Pogues are a cross between the Clancy  Brothers and the Sex Pistols...with five teeth between them.&quot; If that  isn't a ringing enough endorsement to buy this CD I don't know what  is.<br />I've heard the album, no lie, over 1,000 times and every time I am  struck with awe at the passion and musicianship and songwriting prowess of  Shane, Spider (aka &quot;three teeth&quot;) and the boys.  Streets of  Sorrow/Birmingham Six has enough raw power and emotion to transport the  listener to the troubled streets of Belfast.  And the two tracks on the CD  which don't appear on the original album, the Broad Majestic Shannon and  South Australia (I think that's the name of the song) are worth the $$$  alone.  The music is fantastic as the band produces it's most mature and  self-assured sound of any of their albums.<br />Grab a pint of Guiness, put  the CD on, sit back and enjoy this talented band that kicks serious ass  while playing traditional instruments of their forefathers.
B000000645|5.0|I first heard &quot;Hangman's&quot; when I was thirteen years old. I associate it with my conscious awakening. I never listen to it casually; I consider it more than music - I consider it a religous sacrement. The music  defies description - the closest I can say is pure Celtic hippy magic.

B00004S6GL|5.0|cause I'm glad I did! This the first Elliot Smith CD I have and I'm definitely getting another. The songwriting is awesome and Elliot has a great voice! My favorite songs (even though they're all good): Son of Sam,  LA, Color Bars, Can't Make a Sound, and In the Lost and Found.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Very good cd. Worth the money. I was not a huge fan of Eminem, until after this cd.  Usually when you buy a cd, you only like 2 or 3 of the songs, but this cd has many good tracks.  It does have some harsh lyrics that I  wouldn't want my 15 year old brother listening too, but for the older, more  mature audience, it is a very good cd.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I bought this album last month. At first, I felt that the album left something to be desired. I listened to Gravity of Love and Silence Must Be Heard, and thought, &quot;Hmmmm. These are the only good songs on the  album.&quot; But after going through the album again. I found that each  track had a very different beat and feel to it. I must have listened to  this album 200 times, and I still can't get enough of it. This IS my  favourite album. EVER.
0441172717|5.0|the first time i picked up this book, i had the hardest time reading it and put it down several times until i finally gave up.<br />the second time, i couldn't understant why i hadn't finished it.  i turned pages breathlessly  and eyed the list of sequels with a sense of relief that i would be  spending much time in the dune universe.<br />the third time i picked up the  book i wondered what was going on in david lynch's mind when he made the  film.  i, once again, found myself making excuses to read pages here and  there.  managed to miss some bus stops and find reasons for a few long  plane flights.<br />needless to say, i'm a fan.  the rich universe.  the vivid  imagery.  the unpronouncable names.  it all adds up to one of the most  fascinating reads around.  try it if you already haven't and revisit it if  you already have.
0767802659|1.0|&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; may not be the worst film ever made, but it certainly ranks up there.  Director Paul Verhoeven once again demonstrates his preference for excess detail in his production design and action scenes  rather than concentrate on such minor things as character, plot and  motivation.  The characters in this adaptation of Robert Heinlein's best  novel are flat and dull.  Very few of them can act, and those who can't  have to rely on their Barbie and Ken doll good looks to get them through  their scenes.  People joke about William Shatner's wooden performances in  Star Trek, but the so-called acting in this movie makes Shatner's work  appear Oscar-worthy.  The story itself jerks between moralizing about  democracy, being a spoof on fascism, a pathetic love story with lots of  T&amp;A (especially in the shower scene -- Verhoeven seems particularly  enamoured with group nude scenes (Robocop, for example)) with little  chemistry, and a war against an insect race that is portrayed as solely a  monster with little understanding as to why they do what they do.<br />The  effects were astounding, and if you love effects then you'll love this  film.  Phil Tippet's work on the bugs is spectacular, and the space ship  shots occasionally rival the best Star Wars has to offer.  Other than that,  the movie isn't worth the price of a bargain matinee.
B00004S6GL|2.0|I'm a big fan of Elliott Smith's earlier work, but I think he peaked with Either/Or and has been on a gradual slide since.  I enjoyed about half of &quot;XO&quot; but I have to say only 3 or 4 songs on &quot;Figure 8&quot;  do it for me.<br />Too many songs here have meandering melodies with no  payoff.  Far too many songs have impossibly oblique, emotionless lyrics.   Gone is the distinct, original voice of &quot;Either/Or&quot;.  In its  place is a bunch of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; rip-offs.  <br />Worst of  all though, is the whiny, self-pitying tone of so many of these songs as  Elliott seems to be bemoaning his own fame and taking nasty swipes at his  enemies.  Where he used to come off as sincere and tortured, he now just  seems like kind of a jerk.<br />I also agree with the reviewers who believe  this album is overproduced.  I love a big production if it is handled  tastefully, but the copious overdubs (does EVERY song need tack piano?)  take away from the melodies and add only an air of pretention. <br />One of  the biggest disappointments of the year so far and a frustrating misstep  for an artist with seemingly unlimited potential.
B00000J7J4|4.0|It is a superb CD. I enjoyed the variety of sounds, especially Maria Maria ( a fantastic vocal), also Migra, an Arabic tune written by the famous Rachid Taha. Santana guitar playing is amazing.
B000002I25|5.0|The crazy year of 1967 saw much more than its share of classic albums, but none of them sounded anything like this one.  In fact, no one before or since has managed to write music anything like that of the Doors.  This is  both a good and a bad thing; on the one hand this means this kind of music  directly influenced no one (indirect influence is a different story) but it  also means that the band is almost totally unique, and as a result, still  sound interesting today in a way that few bands of the time do.  In a time  where everything was starting to be dominated by hippie optimism and peace  and love and flowers, someone needed to bring to light the darker  underbelly of California and America in general.  Jim Morrison's  pseudopoetical lyrics, combined with some dark and haunting but appealing  music (on its own, Morrison's &quot;poetry&quot; does not hold up) managed  to do this quite well.  One of the four great debut albums to come out this  year (joining those of the Velvet Underground, Pink Floyd, and the Jimi  Hendrix Experience), The Doors is also one of the Doors' best albums (tied  with Morrison Hotel, probably) and is the first purchase anyone interested  in the band beyond the hits should make.  So buy it already!
B000002U9L|5.0|If you love Labyrinth, why not order this CD to go along with it? I keep my copy with my David Bowie albums, heh heh. :) This is an excellent soundtrack and a must for Bowie/fantasy/Henson fans alike. After purchasing  this, I was afraid of it getting warped from repeating track 7 (As The  World Falls Down) for hours on end...c'mon, get it. You'll love it!  &quot;Join the club!&quot;
0618001905|1.0|I really looked forward to reading this book, hoping to gain additional insight into a fascinating period of history. Instead I was dismayed to find myself reading what amounts to a politically correct fable. This book  is shot through with &quot;it's a possibility that so-and-so did this&quot;  and &quot;It's reasonable to assume that such-and-such could have  happened&quot;. Is this what passes for historical scholarship? Not only  that but incredibly there is no evidence given to support the book's  central thesis, that millions of Africans were killed during the time of  Leopold's control of the Congo. As far as I'm concerned the author  accomplished his primary purpose, to grind his politically correct axe at  the expense of people no longer alive to defend themselves. If you want to  find out about this period and place in history look elsewhere.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Buy it. That is the simple advice I give to anyone remotley interested in this movie. The effects were spectacular and needless to say, lots of things get shot full of holes. The plot was downright creepy and the scene  with all the humans in pink egg things was one of the coolest I have ever  scene. If you are looking for a great movie with incredible special  effects, this is the movie to own. Oh yeah, and that helicopter scene was  neat to!
B000007T1M|5.0|System of A Down's self titled album has to be the best album I have ever purchased. This is because of the ecclectic way the album flows. The melodic harmony of &quot;spiders&quot;, the spastic almost circus like  riffs of &quot;Sugar&quot;, the dramatic shift in tone of  &quot;Suggestions&quot; and the thrashing sounds of &quot;CubeRT&quot; keep  this CD in constant rotation in my cd player. This is a Cd that you can  never get bored with because in each song the tone and the flow are  constantly changing. It's a MUST HAVE for any rock enthusiast
B00003CXCT|5.0|This film is exciting and has really neato special effects. But don't let the title fool you. Jar Jar is not even mentioned in the film. I think that there should be a special edition that includes the history of our favorite  character, Senor Jar Jar.
B00000AFHM|5.0|My friends and I have already come to the conclusion that, come September, Belle and Sebastian will remind us of this summer.  The songs have a tendency to seep into your life like none other.  Every day we wake up to a  cigarette and &quot;Boy with the Arab Strap.&quot;  Every night we fall  asleep watching the images on a muted tv dance to &quot;Sleep the Clock  Around.&quot;  Although &quot;...Sinister&quot; seems to be considered the  favorite among people, I can't help but hear (or feel) the album everywhere  I go.  It's catchy, but not in a pop sense.  Stuart Murdoch's lyrics float  along perfectly in the music- suspending you in a surreal world, but always  keeps a foot grounded in reality.   One interesting note- I recently  discovered that the band's name comes from the animated French children's  show &quot;Belle &amp; Sebastian&quot; about a boy and his horse.  I can  vaguely remember watching that show when I couldn't have been more than 4  or 5 at my grandparent's house.  This adds an even deeper, and strangely  nostaligic tinge to their music for me. All in all, they're a fantastic  band with a beautiful yet diverse sound.  Check them out.
B00004T9UF|5.0|this is one the best cd's you will ever here there  are funny songs and energetic i features both dr.dre and snoop dogg. the great thing about this cd is that eminem is showing that he is a rap singer that tcan say anything  he wants to say and isn't afraid of it, if you didn't like his last cd you  you will hate this one because it is 10 times worse, but if you loved his  last cd you will be the one writing a review.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I was one of those punk teens in 1980 when &quot;Sandanista&quot; came out and changed my mind about what punk could accomplish. It was more than three chords, it was THE WORLD. Tracks like &quot;The Call Up&quot; and  &quot;Broadway&quot; hypnotized and &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; just  hipped. The CD version takes away the chore of flipping all those sides.  But where is Tymon Dogg now? I wish the bands of the Zeros were this  musically and intellectually deep. A masterpiece.
B00002DE2L|5.0|For years - ever since I began listening to classical music, the ONLY version of the Four Seasons that I listened to was Karl Munchinger and the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra. I bought Anne-Sophie Mutter's new version on a  hunch that it was time to hear a new interpretation. I was suprised, amazed  and awed. Her Summer and WInter explode with power, and she has not only a  fine control of her instrument, she seems to savor and LIVE in each note. I  liked what I heard so much, I bought her Beethoven's Concerto for  Violin/Triple Concerto (DG, Karajan cond.) and now love that as well.
0395317576|5.0|Roger Fisher and William Ury, of the Harvard Negotiation Project, brought together all the strategies of negotiation and explain how to use them and why they work. Many of the strategies seem like common sense, but the  authors give concrete examples to help the reader become more aware of the  good methods.<br />At first, I thought this would be another book which simply  gave pointers on good negotiation.  The writers go a step further and  discuss what to do when faced with a party which uses unfair negotiation  tactics (like threats or good guy/bad guy).  Invaluable.<br />This is all  written in an easy-to-read format and well worth the time to read.
B000002BQK|5.0|The album 'Butterfly' is a genius blend of lyrics, emotions, and music.  'Honey' is an interesting blend of pop and hip-hop.  The track 'Breakdown' is my personal favorite because a person can relate to the lyrics, the beat  and music is wonderful, and the rap goes perfectly with Mariah's singing.   That track is a good example of what the record is all about.  This record  is great.  Mariah has definitily not lost her touch on this record, even if  it was released 3 years ago.
B000001FOL|4.0|Compare to Marble Index and Desserthorse, this collection seems not impressive enough to be labelled as a &quot;classic&quot;. However, it's a good album by its own right. The string arrangement suites the melancholic  aura very well, and the songs are of good melody, for example,  &quot;Chelsea girl&quot;, &quot;Fairest of seasons&quot;...etc. This album  suggest the latter gothic style of Nico, though it's not as explicit as  &quot;Marble Index&quot;, it's different from ordinary pop. Immense sadness  and melancholy...
0790729970|5.0|I've always loved the movie on video,but the DVD version is the best,with the Directors Commentary,and Deleted Scenes,trailer,and Digital Picture,Such a Great Movie with all the Special Efects,they sure brought  the Mask right from the comic book pages,to the big screen,DVD or Video,A  Must See,Jim Carrey's Best Movie Ever,I can't wait The Mask 2!
B00004STPT|5.0|Overall, I can only say that this soundtrack is the most thrilling, enjoyable, beautiful and astonishing piece of music written for the movies in the last 30 years. It's third on my list, after Braveheart and Life is  Beautiful. Buy this one!
0679424741|5.0|Mick Kelly, a young tomboy of a girl who has a fire in her belly for classical music and tends her brother Bubber, is a dynamic enough character to make this book a must read.  Add to her presence characters like John  Singer, a mute resident of the Kellys' boarding house, Bill Brannon,  proprietor of the New York Cafe, Doctor Benedict, who is black in a small  southern town early in the 20th Century, Mady Copeland, drinking Jake  Blount who has visions, and you have a mix worth of solid reading.  The  book has some of the deeply introspective magic of Sherwood Anderson's  WINESBURG, OHIO, but is an original on its own.  It is an amazing  accomplishment for a 23-year old to write what is her master work.  By  reading this book you will know the characters as well as family members,  and the book will make you smile, and will leave a lump in your throat.   This book is to novels what CASABLANCA is to movies -- not a wasted word --  a classic!

B0000029AL|4.0|One of my personal favorite albums of all time,rawnchy,bluesy,raw rock music ...simply produced.Very Real.
158234082X|4.0|There's a tough, honest, loving philosophy that unites all the scuzzy stories in this fascinating book. This man is not a whiner. He has true modesty and an authentic voice as a writer. Convinced me to run right out  and buy a Global knife, too! I just wish I had caught the NPR interview.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Ok i just want to start by saying that I really like this album.  Its awesum! Tracks 2,3,7,10,11 13 and 16 are all great.  #7 is the best one listen to it.  Its haunting yet it has insight on how eminem feels and he  keeps saying that he is whatever the media says he is.  I gave it 4.5 stars  not 5 because sum of it is just horrible.  Ken KAniff is just terrible and  Kim is disturbing although i like it.  I suggest buying this album right  now if you can take a joke and wont take this too seriously.
B000007MVM|5.0|If you like Van Gogh's picture, Krubrick's film, Allen Poe's novels, hey, Syd Barrett's music will be for you. Most of the memories of him are his lone masterpiece in Pink Floyd &quot;the piper at the gates of dawn&quot;,  yes, it's a masterpiece. But if you want something more thrilling, more  droning into your heart and soul, try this one. At the first listening,  it's very unpleasant, yes, it's not &quot;enjoyable&quot;, it's about a  man's reaction to total mental collapse. It's a sad record, yet, it has a  fragile sad beautiness. The bleak accompliment is suitable to express what  Syd was feeling then... listening to &quot;Long Gone&quot;, &quot;no Man's  land&quot;, &quot;late night&quot;... the desprate mood can't be more  intense.
6300183211|5.0|Scarface is a movie of its time. It depicts a violent era with unsurpassed realism, in an entertaining but shocking way. If you like your mafia movies with attitude, blood, story and more attitude like Goodfellas, you will  love and hate Pacino in this one of his classic roles. Be warned, it is  violent, and full of profanity (maybe a record amount). This is The  Godfather of Disco Mafia at its best!
B000002NIW|5.0|This is what hard music should be all about (from metal to hardcore to emo and post-grunge and everything in between). Expression and raw emotion without sacrificing instrumental and compositional quality. Simply put, Deftones are one of the best - if not THE best - new young hard music bands  to appear in the 90's.<br />First and most important - the carve out a  soundscape all their own. They sound like absolutely no one. If you must  find a label for it, call it &quot;emocore&quot; -- the rage and intensity  of hardcore, but with the sensitivity, diversity and musicality of emo.  <br />The best adjective for this music is &quot;haunting&quot;. It's  relentlessly heavy, but incorporates textures, atmosphere and minor keys to  give you the chills. Check out &quot;Shove It&quot; and &quot;Dai The  Flu&quot; and &quot;MX&quot; to hear it. Chino's voice is versatile and  supple - going from haunting whispers and soft crooning lullabyes to  all-out, furious screaming fury - many times in the space of a second. It's  a rare trait nowadays to find a vocalist that can sing softly and sound  sensual and contemplative vs. just disturbed or tortured.<br />And the  guitars! Heavy, raw, biting, precise and sharp -- and in your face. Awesome  attack and excellent chordal progressions -- again, haunting, dark and  deadly. Check out &quot;Shove It&quot; and &quot;Lotion&quot;. It's an  excellent use of minor chords and textures to create effect. The bass is  heavy and relentless - it's the foundation of this band. Not alot of  melodic finger runs here -- the emphasis is on solid, unstoppable rhythmic  pulse and groove with the drums. And the drums...I have got to say Abe  Cunningham is without a doubt one of the most brilliant hard music players  to hit the scene, yet he remains underrated. Listen to the precision and  arrangement of his playing...his groove while paying attention to detail  and coloring and nuance. Sneak peak: I have an advanced copy of &quot;White  Pony&quot; and Abe outdoes the performance on &quot;Around The  Fur&quot;!<br />My favorite part of this whole album is the  production...sterling and crystal-clear without sacrificing the rawness and  immediacy that make it so compelling. Every instrument is a distinct  voice.<br />Get into these guys if you haven't already done so...THIS is what  hard music should sound like in the 90's...it really outdoes much of what's  in the market today (you know who I mean - the Korns, Bizkits, and Stainds  of the world, etc.). Not that all of the bands are bad...it's just that the  Deftones are even better. Picks: &quot;Shove It&quot;, &quot;Drive&quot;,  &quot;Dai The Flu&quot;, &quot;Lotion&quot;....
B0000011N5|5.0|At first listening, it's quite pleasurable... but it sounds like that there is no &quot;great hits&quot; ... after repetitive listening I find that each song is of astonishing standard... the first half is electric  jazz... very gentle and funny... and second half  is accoustic poetic  songs... the most chilling is &quot;isle of islay&quot;, &quot;someone's  singing&quot;(backed with Jack Bruce!)and &quot;Mandolin man with his  secret&quot;. Enjoy this in a quiet saturday afternoon...
6305212112|5.0|Collectors' editions can be a bit of a scam, a few tacky bells and whistles to make you think you're getting something cool. But Fried Green Tomatoes' collectors' edition was beyond my wildest dreams. Don't even  think of buying the standard version if you can get this one. The  &quot;making of it&quot; is a full-length documentary in its own right, and  dispenses star interviews intermingled with unusual gossip and tidbits for  fans... like why did Mary Stuart Masterton *really* do her own bee stunt!   (The stunt double panicked and refused.)<br />The director's comments option  was awesome - as is the case with any film where the project is the  director's baby and a labor of love for years (as FGT was for Jon Avnet).  The restored scenes shown were fascinating - such as Idgy mooning adoringly  over Ruth while Ruth's teaching; and Grady pointing out to Idgy he doesn't  wear size 14 boots and was certainly *not* a member of the KKK. For the  most part (with two exceptions) I was very sad the removed scenes never  made the final cut on original release.<br />The only quibble is the lovely  little picture booklet the DVD comes with is at odds with some facts  contained in the movie documentary. (eg That panicked stunt double  apparently didn't panic after all if you believe the booklet.) And the  booklet also promises a recipe for Fried Green Tomatoes on the DVD which  isn't there. Nonetheless - this version is worth absolutely every cent.  Tawandas out there should settle for nothing less...
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Una excelente producción.<br />Muy similar a PIECE OF MIND y POWERSLAVE. Efectivamente con el regreso de Bruce y Adrian la banda vuelve a ser MAIDEN.<br />UP THE IRONS!
0316777722|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs an introduction to David Sedaris' work. This collection is, perhaps, my favorite (although Naked runs a close second). I'm going to get the audio also just so I can hear  him tell the stories. No matter how bizarre or how awful the people are  with whom he interacts, Sedaris manages to find the seed of humanity and  that is refreshing.
B00004T8RK|4.0|In the year 2000, it seems as though only one grunge band from the Seattle explosion of the early 90s remains. Mudhoney and Soundgarden both broke up. Alice In Chains are MIA. Nirvana broke up after the death of the sorely  missed Kurt Cobain. Candlebox sucked to begin with and Hole went Hollywood.  The only one left seems to be Pearl Jam, and the band seems determined to  leave behind all the fans who jumped on the &quot;Ten&quot; bandwagon, and  slowly but steadily got off with each album afterwards.<br />Pearl Jam's  latest effort sees them moving more and more into the Neil Young territory,  first explored on &quot;No Code&quot;. This album is a somewhat more  gentler piece than their last studio album, &quot;Yield&quot;. <br />The first  three tracks, &quot;Breakerfall&quot;, &quot;Gods' Dice&quot;, and  &quot;Evacuation&quot; are the only rockers, and seemed to be placed at the  front in order to get them out of the way of what awaits on the rest of the  album. &quot;Binaural&quot; combines the experimental aspect of  &quot;Vitalogy&quot; with the soft rock stylings of &quot;No Code&quot;.  While this is by no means a bad album, one has to wonder where Pearl Jam is  exactly going with their sound. Gone is some of the raw emotion that fueled  &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Vs.&quot; and in it's place is a more stoner rock  styled sound, with Vedder's vocals becoming more and more restrained.  <br />Still, &quot;Binaural&quot; is quite a few steps above the current bands  flooding the rock scene. Pearl Jam serve as a reminder that bands like  Creed had to steal their sound from somewhere.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Ok, so people are complaining about Em's new cd, especially the song &quot;Kim&quot;.  I have to admit that I don't own the cd, I've just listened to it from friends, and I was amazed at what I heard.  I think  that the song &quot;Kim&quot; is one of the most amazing songs I have ever  heard in my life.  It provokes an emotional response from the listener--it  tells a story that other artists don't tell. It contains real emotions, and  it's too bad that some people are too afraid to admit that the  &quot;vulgur&quot; and &quot;disturbing&quot; lyrics are what makes the  song that much more powerful and honest.  I plan on buying the cd, and it's  all thanks to that one song. Listen to it, you won't regret it.
B00000BKDV|5.0|It's difficult to pick a BEST Iron Maiden album, as each studio album from &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; to &quot;Seventh Son...&quot; has some special merit. However, I feel that this album (the first with the  DEFINITIVE line up offers the most of what  makes IM great.  Sing-a-longs  like &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Die With Your Boots On&quot; as well  as epics &quot;Revelations&quot; and &quot;To Tame a Land&quot; offers a  listener the range of Maidens abilities.  The production may not be as  sharp as &quot;Powerslave&quot; and &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; may  have more notable tunes but for my money this is what Maiden is all about.
0783242808|5.0|I have had so many laughs off of this movie. It is definitely the Porky's of the 90's and beyond. I have had the chance to see the rated version and have bought the unrated version....the uncut scenes are very few (the pie  scene for one) the others are unnoticable at best.  If you are going to buy  one, I would definately go with the unrated version.  This version has a  Tonic Video in the beginning which is kind of cool.  At the end of the  movie there are some interivews and outtakes which are pretty cool to see.  As for the movie itself, its probably the best comedy of 99 by far.  Everyone knows someone from high school whose main goal was to have sex,  American Pie takes that idea and exploits it.  There are too many funny  moments in this movie to mention. This is one of those videos that everyone  should have in their collection!  Hightly Recommended!
B000001ESP|5.0|Describe this masterpiece in less than a  1,000 words? I'll try...Most people associate Rush with Geddy Lee's high pitched vocals and Neil Peart's drumming exploits.  Moving Pictures was the first album on which the band  songwriting skills rose to the same level as their musicianship. &quot;Tom  Sawyer&quot;, &quot;Limelight&quot; and &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; still  receive radio play because the SONGS are timeless. Sure, Terry Browns  production ensures that the hardcore Rush fan can hear every guitar line  and drum fill in stunning clarity but the casual fan will enjoy the  relatively unassuming lyrical reflections these songs offer.
630575067X|5.0|George Lucas did it again.  Star Wars Phantom Menace is excellent.  This movie is nothing like Episode 4, but it certainly lives up to its hype.  There are many characters that have ties to the first series of movies that  most of us are familiar with.....young Anikin Skywalker, the future Darth  Vader, C3PO, R2D2, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Yoda.  This story is one big  adventure that is fast paced with more special effects than you can shake a  stick at.  Lucas definately put a lot of time into this as his attention to  detail is nothing short of incredible.  I have watched this 3 times now,  and have noticed something new each time I watch it.  This movie certainly  lives up to the Star Wars name and is great for the kids as well as Adults.   This is by far the best Science Fiction movie in the last decade!  I  highly recommend this movie!
0345350499|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Five years ago, I read the Once and Future King (which I absolutely loved). My HS Senior yr teacher found out and recommended this book. Since I was not really fond of her, I never  bothered looking for it. About a month ago I saw it and couldn't resist. It  is so awesome. It is incredibly long, but worth the time. The characters  are so life like, and the events unfold naturally. Nothing is forced, not  even the ending. It seems like other longer length books have a rushed  ending, but not this one. Beautiful descriptions, I could imagine  everything!  It was a little haunting though. It was creepy at times, but  in a way that adds to the effect.
B00003W8NM|5.0|What I expected was a 1950's style, retro movie about gladiators (This is no Rocky type picture!)  beating...each other with no gloves, only to come to back to work the next day at the foundry.  What I got was a solid punch in the face about social issues and the power of  facism which was able to be rooted in underground, top-secret slugfests.   It was alarming to see that a grassroots movement could have so much  momentum.  Brad Pitt was brilliant as usual as well as Edward Norton and  Helena Bonham-Carter as a strange, black widow type character for which she  is perfectly typecast.  Trust me- you'll not be bored but floored!
0780627024|5.0|I have always enjoyed film, some more than others.  In teaching I will often use film and theater to illustrate aspects of how ones character interacts with the world's demands and how our ability to defer  gratification matures with each stress and challenge we meet in daily life.  As Nietze said, &quot;That which does not kill you will make you  stronger.&quot; The message in &quot;Pleasantville&quot; is not  deep but  also is not that obvious.<br />&quot;Pleasantville&quot; is about morals,  ethics and choice.  It is about a community that is created devoid of all  temptation.   It is about an Eden where people behave as if there are no  biological, animal-based drives. The drives that are ignored make up the Id  and consist of the drives to &quot;fight, flight, feed and fornicate.&quot;  In Pleasantville the characters completely deny these drives.  This  &quot;psychotic denial&quot; is most evident when Mary Sue's mother denies  any knowledge of &quot;sex&quot; but the reality is that she has had two  children.  The citizens of Pleasantville are predestined to live their  lives by rigid scripts that can never change because there is no reality  outside of those scripts.  There are no morals, no ethics and no religion.   There were only scripts (law).  But the end (a pleasant life) does not  justify the means.  Moral and clean behavior without any choice or internal  sense of right and wrong is not anything, it just is.  Without temptation  people can never be given the opportunity to develop standards of behavior  based on an internal sense of right and wrong. <br />&quot;God&quot;  introduces to Pleasantville, through Bud and Mary Sue, an wareness of  &quot;Id&quot; and Pleasantville is not prepared to handle it.  The effects  are initially not good.  There is unrestrained seeking of immediate  gratification of primitive biological drives.  It should be noted that the  characters do not change to color because they engage in immoral and  dangerous behaviors.Bud and Mary Sue do not change to color until later  in the film. Mary Sue actually questions why she has not changed to color  even though she had been &quot;10 times&quot; more sexually active than  anybody else.  The change had nothing to do with sex or behaving badly.   The color came as the individuals were able to develop the character  (coping skills) and maturity needed to allow for proper restraint.   (Personality is the constellation of coping skills an individual uses to  deal with stress. Deferring immediate gratification causes stress.  Our  ability to defer gratification and make choices are what make up our  character and personality and each of us our unique &quot;color&quot;. )   Mary Sue did not change to color until she chose to turn down her usual  &quot;romp in the hay&quot; in order to read and study.  Mary Sue was as  &quot;Black and White&quot; in the real world as she was in Pleasantville.   Bud changed when he realized that there were some things worth fighting for  and restraint &quot;because that is the way it should be&quot; was  different than restraint by choice.<br />I found that the best scenes involved  &quot;Lover's Lane&quot;. Once Id was introduced it was a location of pure  hedonism and debauchery.  But, most of the characters did not change to  color while engaged in this behavior.  Color came not with the scenes of  &quot;making out&quot; but with the sublimated, mature intimacy found in  sharing poetry, reading, spending time and sharing company.  Mary Sue's  date stayed &quot;Black and White&quot; until the end.  His overt sexual  behavior and acting out was not rewarded with color.  Unrestrained Id is as  &quot;Black and White&quot; as an Id that is psychotically denied.  It was  the development of coping to defer gratification of Id (character) that  gave color.<br />The town's people also had unrestrained Id (fight/flight) and  their violence and prejudice kept them &quot;Black and White&quot;.   Bud's  defense in court allowed them to understand and transcend their immediate  need to fight something that they did not understand.  As their irrational,  concrete hate and irrationality gave way they too gained color and grew in  character (tolerance).   <br />The film has its shortcomings and internal  inconsistencies but was over all it is a good reflection of changes that  are happening in today's American culture.   I do not know if the writer  and director intended their messages or if they came as a by-product of  their observations.  Regardless, the film is thought provoking and opens  doors for discussion.
B00003Q43A|4.0|True, this movie is your typical no-brainer, but you have to love its worn-out Hollywood theme of losers coming together as one to defeat a common, monstrous enemy.  By losers we see a failing, ineffective president; an MIT graduate working for a cable company; a shell-shocked,  drunken Vietnam fighter pilot who can't hold down a cropdusting job;  another fighter pilot who gets slammed with repeated rejection in his bid  to fly the space shuttle, and his girl, a small town stripper with airheads  for friends.  In the end, however, the good guys prevail, and even send a  message:  Despite our differences in race or politics, when we unite and  stand together, even losers can defeat a monstrous, terrifying enemy.   Excellent special effects and a heartwarming if not corny concept boost  this movie's overall rating.
B000007T2Z|5.0|I first heard of GYBE! when there were Radiohead rumours abound about how Thom Yorke was into the band and that they had been asked to tour with Radiohead and that Thom had attended a couple of their live gigs.  Not sure  how true all of the rumours were, but I was intrigued to check the band  out.  This band is amazing!  The songs are very dramatic and very  emotional.  It is very *building* and relaxing while at the same time very  chaotic.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is into classical  music, space rock, indie-rock...just appeals to so many people!  Goes to  show that great music doesn't have any boundaries!<br />I'd also recommend a  record I just picked up by a band called Cobolt.  Their album &quot;Spirit  on Parole&quot; has the same sort of mood as GYBE...very melancholy yet  very beautiful!  Their record is an absolute must!<br />Also, try out Mogwai,  Spiritualized, or the new Yo La Tengo.
B00004SCX6|1.0|WARNING:THE FOLLOWING USE OF WORDS WILL NOT BE UNDERSTOOD BY BRITNEY FANS.  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! Although I could britney bash all day long, let me start with the obvious.  SHE CAN'T SING But I don't want to waste my 1,000 words saying that. I previewed a snippet of the only song written by  her(believe me, it wasn't on my discretion) and I felt as if my ears were  assaulted and infected by a venemous ooze secreting from my stereo  speakers. This ooze is particularly characteristic of bad pop music. Such  &quot;Teeny-Bopper&quot; pop should come with a warning label stating that  anyone who listens to it will lose brain cells, impairing their  decision-making process between good and bad music. <br />Let's say for once  (and only once), that she could sing.  I know that's a stretch, but let's  cooperate. Bad singing not withstanding, the lyrics, meaning to be deep  heart-felt love songs, sound more like songs from a third grader, with a  crush on his teacher (OUCH!). If you like these childish (at best) lyrics,  you should invest your money in some Raffi cassette tapes. Not only are the  lyrics horrible and completely tasteless, she can't even sing them at her  concerts. Have you ever noticed the 3 rows of background singer drowning  out her voice? Gee, I wonder why. If, she had been around 10 years ago, and  people found out she was lip-syncing, she would have been booed of the  stage. (Can you say Milli Vanilli?)<br />Need we go on?
B000002VTE|5.0|Some say that this is the worst spiritualized record because it is more *pop*...I'd have to disagree and say this is one of the best spiritualized records.  The songs are still very spacey yet have more of an edge.  J is  writing some of his best material yet with this record, and I'm excited to  hear new stuff as I hear he is back in the studio working on a new record.   <br />Some say he shouldn't have gotten rid of the other band members and the  music suffered because of that...ha!...some say he needs to get back on the  smack to make good music...ha!...with a record like this, who needs  drugs!<br />Other recent buys which I would totally recommend are  Cobolt-&quot;Spirit On Parole&quot; (a must for fans of the melancholy,  slow-rock fused with space elements), Yo La Tengo's new record, and Talvin  Singh-&quot;OK&quot;.
B000003TSP|4.0|Portishead is much more than trip-hop. Listening to them is like witnessing the moody, organic sounds of jazz joining with the abstract sounds of Steve Riech and then throwing it on the turn-table of the peanut  butter wolf. <br />Beth's approach in this work is moving in its self. Her  haunting voice becons you to listen closer. With out her, this would be  boring and average music. <br />The strings are a nice touch to the album, so  are the guitars on &quot;Over&quot;. Overall, I wish they would have lost  the sci-fi element, other than that this is excellent music to end a  night.<br />Rating: A-
B00000DC10|5.0|for fans of punk, hardcore, politics, fugazi, jawbox, 1988, and innovation.<br />This is one of the best records to come out in the last 10 years.  This is a very aggressive record but also very experimental in relation to their past material and hardcore in general...experimentation  can lead to crap, but this is one of the most prolific records to come out  in a long time.  REFUSED!  Sad to say they're broken up.<br />Speaking of  which, I think Dennis is in a new band, and I know one of the other guys is  in a new band called Cobolt and they have an album called &quot;Spirit on  Parole&quot;...damn amazing album...!
B00004RF83|5.0|Extremely provocative and thought provoking, this movie is diametrically opposed to the political atmosphere of the day.  I was totally flabbergasted that a mainstream Hollywood conspiracy thriller, with a large  budget and an all-star cast could have been made in 1964 with this kind of  plot. (If the film were made in 1974, when the military were being blandly  villainised in every movie from \\"MASH\\" to \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" I would  not have been surprised.  But in 1964 military men were still being  heroised with full cold war propaganda enthusiasm.)  \\"Seven Days in May\\",  together with \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" (1962) are in a class all of their  own as political commentaries from this era.  The fundamental question  raised by this movie is `could a military coup d'etat take place in the  United States?'  I can only conclude that this movie has not gotten the  attention that it deserves because too many people have dismissed this  question with an all too smug `no.'<br />\\"Seven Days in May\\" breaks all of the  predictable Hollywood formulas by casting in the villains role the handsome  and dashing Burt Lancaster (General James Matoon Scott),  a heroic General  (the chairman of the joint chiefs) who, together with the other chiefs,  feels that he must temporarily usurp the democratic government of The  United States to protect the American people from a naive and faulty  nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviets.  The weak and unpopular  lame-duck President (March) is an unlikely hero (by Hollywood standards),  as is his ally, a corrupt Georgian Senator (Edmond O' Brien).  An aging Ava  Gardner is well cast as the Generals jaded mistress.  Kirk Douglas gives an  excellent performance as the Generals aide, torn between his loyalty to the  General and his belief in the democratic process.  The only drawback to the  movie is that the acting performances are somewhat dwarfed by the scope of  the subject matter (a problem Douglas didn't have in `Spartacus.')  Thereare no emotionally charged scenes, just a lot of deadpan political  intrigue.  But this intrigue is more than enough to hold the audiences  attention!<br />I agree with many of the comments made by Eric Paddon (below)  about the movie being a watered-down version of the book.  However, since  this was a mainstream Hollywood movie from the early sixties, it had to be  somewhat simplified for the naive movie audiences of the day. (The movie  might have become a little bit TOO ambiguous if the producers had shown  that General Scott was right in a practical sense, while President Lyman  was right in an ABSOLUTE sense.)  Nevertheless I am still amazed by the  maturity of its content.  I particularly love President Layman's closing  speech to the nation, since history has proven it to be true!  I highly  recommend this movie for all audiences.
0140131558|4.0|A professor of mine once said that she wasn't going to take the easy route and describe this book as a cross between Raymond Chandler and Albert Camus. Well, in not doing so, she did so anyway. The comparison stuck. And it works too. Imagine a detective story where you never find out who the killer is, and it doesn't matter! It's so good.<br />Auster packs his books with weighty ideas, while leaving the prose dry and sparse. I think it works. Let the reader breathe a bit, and maybe they'll wrap their head around the story tight enough to get hooked in. It is at this point, of course that Auster reveals that there really is no story, and you've just contemplated the true meaning of human existence. Okay, not really. But at least he's got you thinking.
B000002GYI|5.0|This is a great album that every electronics fan needs to have (along with every other Kraftwerk CD).  What amazes me most is that they use such simple lyrics yet totally convey their message.  Considering the year this  album was released it is also amazing that they could see so well into the  future of how computers will be so important to us.  Musically, the theme  is totally obvious.  Computer sounds turned into awesome electronic music  as only Kraftwerk could do.  Its fun and quirky and one of the best albums  in this genre.
B000002LIX|5.0|Someone once said that Jane's was popular because they managed to combine the hit-me-in-the-crotch riffage so adored by metalheads with the cerebral shoegazing of the alterna crowd.  Whatever the case may be, here's an album  that hits all the emotional notes.<br />The first half IS hard rock.  Energy  pumping classics like Stop! and of course Been Caught Stealing manage to be  visceral, interesting, unique, and most of all fun.<br />The second half is  slow and epic and gorgeous.  It starts with Three Days (which is the song  that will be playing when I arrive at the pearly gates) and ends with the  most beautiful song ever recorded, Classic Girl.  And in between, healthy  mixes of Indian rhythms, melodic bass lines, and atmospheric guitars take  you places that you've never been, and quite frankly, will never see  again.<br />Maestro Perry Farrell (peripheral?) once said that if you're an  artist and you reach #1, then you're doing something wrong.  The artist is  there to challenge the audience, not pacify them.  I don't know if they  ever reached #1 with this, but even if they did, I don't see how they could  be doing anything else but.
6304578458|3.0|When I first saw this movie I was apalled at the blase way they aproach the subject of being a hired assasin.  It was rather unfunny, and I have much more of a flair for romantic comedies and classics.  However not being  one to sit through movies and annoyingly say to those around me, &quot;That  would never happen...&quot; For if it could happen it would be that much  less entertaining. I did not and stomached the mediocriy of this black  comedy. It was not enjoyable nor unenjoyable so I left it at the idea that  i was never to see it again. However, I have a brother who persuaded me to  do otherwise and the second time I saw it, much to my surprise, I cracked a  smile.  Then the third time my brother pleaded and cajoled me into watching  his well loved movie I laughed and found myself... gasp...enjoying it much  more than I wanted to.  So the verdict would be, not good by a long shot  but it definitly grows on you.  Watch it in good cmpany and you'll enjoy it  that muc more.
0345403959|4.0|I have to admit that I read the whole series in less than one month and that includes the belgariad and the mallorean but not polgara, so of course I was addicted and will obviously give it a good review. This book, like  all the others written by Eddings, will cause the reader to go into  withdrawl with it closed. I'll be the first to admit that Eddings didn't do  anything monumental with his series but did acomplish what I believe was  his purpose- a novel that will suck you into it and let you escape reality  for a while. This book wasn't quite as good as the other series but it was  definately worth a try. Do yourself a favor and don't leave this on the  shelf.
6303617719|5.0|Who could not laugh at the way Meg Ryan scrunches up her nose.  Or the way Kevin Kline misconstrues the meaning in a high five.  French Kiss is at the top of my list for romantic comedys.  It is the one movie i can watch over  and over again, and still not tire of the well acted and personable  characters, cute plot and overall way it makes me smile. I highly recomend  this light and yummy romance.
0060922583|5.0|The first words after the title, on the book's front cover &quot;A remarkable new theory of reality that explains:&quot; blah blah blah, aborts the message of this timeless classic. The information presented here  is not new, nor does Mr. Talbot take credit for presenting any  revolutionary new theory. What Mr. Talbot does do, is bring together a  compendium of the vast resources of our past and current cultures and  present the distillation of those views in a highly readable and easily  digestable manner. This book cannot help but to change the life of the  reader if they have even an iota of receptiveness. The only readers who  will walk away unmoved by this work are those who lack the capacity to  assimilate ideas new to them or those who believe they already have. For  all the others, I highly praise this book.
0312954468|2.0|I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED WILBUR SMITHS BOOKS AS A  GREAT HOLIDAY READ BUT THIS WAS SO OVER EXPLAINED AND UNBELEIVABLE AS TO BE PAINFUL TO READ.I REALISE THIS WAS TO TEMPT US INTO BELEIVING THAT MYTH MIGHT BE TRUTH BUT  THE STORY LINE WAS SO LABOURED IT LOST MY INTEREST.
B000000LZV|5.0|Though overlooked, this is the masterpiece of the 80's. I must agree albums like London Calling, The Queen Is Dead, Up On The Sun, I Can't Stop It &amp; Zen Arcade are classic albums, none of them have the spirit of  this album. 45 songs (43 on the cd) all delivered in the space of a regular  cd (or double lp) and absolutely no gristle, it's all meat here.<br />To me,  this is the true definition of &quot;punk.&quot; Much like London Calling,  it might not be 3 power chords at blazing speed, and screamed vocals, it's  something more important. Intelligent music with intelligent lyrics. Punk  isn't so much a sound, it's more an attitude/feeling.<br />I love the way the  music here doesn't fit into any certain genre. Is it funk? Is it hadcore?  Is it jazz? Is it blues? Is it folk? Is it country? It's all of that and  more, usually in the same song.<br />The only thing I didn't like, was the  band's cover of the classic Van Halen song &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout  Love&quot; &amp; their original &quot;Mr. Robot's Holy Orders&quot; were  left off of the cd (to fascilitate a single cd, I'd imagine), but if you  can't find the vinyl, then the cd is the next best thing. Either way you  go, you will not be disappointed.<br />And to kidpunkrock182, thanks man. I  really needed that. Best laugh I've had in ages! :D
B00004T9UF|3.0|When I got this cd, i expected it to be as good as other peeps say.  But, when I listened to it, I had a hard time getting through some very disturbing tracks.  The track that was most disturbing was the one about  his wife.  I just feel that that isn't right at all.  Despite that, all the  other songs were ok.  One of the songs that I wasn't expecting was Stan.   It didn't seem like Eminem would have that kind of song.  Other than this,  I would only recommend you to buy this album if you are a hardcore Eminem  fan.  If not, you should get something like Cypress Hill or somethin like  that.
B000001E7T|5.0|Polly Jean has always suprised us with her incredible music. But on this landmark disc she launches herself to a upper level of greatness of musician's of the 90's or any other decade. Yes, that's right this may one  of the two greatest dics of the 90's. It opens with one of the most  powerful and scary songs you've ever heard. It ends on a beautiful but very  unique note. Get this disc, take your time with it and the payoffs are  nothing short of amazing !
B000021XS0|5.0|Scenes From A Memory was the first DT album I had ever listened to.  I must say that it was the most mind opening album I had ever heard before.  Being mainly a metal fan  (pre-sellout Metallica and Megadeth, Iron Maiden,  etc.) I wasn't quite sure what to expect from an album advertised as  progressive rock.  I have to say this album allowed me to make the  priogressive transition beautifully. SFAM is not your typical prog album.  It is filled with cruching riffs courtesy of John Petrucci's Ibanez 6-and-7  strings. The musicianship is outstanding, Petrucci and Drummer Mike Portnoy  are one of the best teams in music today, and together with keyboradist  Jordan Rudess, and Bassist John Myung, they have created a musical opus  that blows the mind. What's realy great about this album is that the songs  don't follow any musical rules, they totaly shift from fast, and aggressive  riff driven tunes to slow melodic numbers that really tie the songs  together.  The only down side to this album is that because it is a concept  album, you have to listen to the entrie album all the way through each time  you listen to it, but because the album is so good you are able to enjoy as  much the 50th time through it as you did on the 1st listen. As I mentioned  before, SFAM is a concept album taking the idea first introduced in  &quot;Metropolis PT. 1&quot; (from Images and Words) and running with it.   The basic plot involves a man reutrning to 1928 and to the murder of a  mysterious young girl named Vicotria(although quite honestly, i can be  getting this totaly wrong)In closing, listen to this album if you love  great musicianship and if you would like to make the transistion from metal  into the deeper world of prog rock.
B000031X7T|5.0|This is a great album. I personally think that The Wall (the original one) was an amazing album, the Wall Live just adds to the beauty of it.. If you don't have this album its definitely worth the money... Trust me ... GO BUY  IT !
B00003CX95|5.0|This is a wonderful movie I love it!Mel Gibson is a great director and also a great actor for his role for William Wallace.I was addicted to this movie since I borrow from my friend then I bought this movie,the story was  great and you can't stop watching it.The battle scene was intense and  brutal,WOW! the romantic scene with his girlfriend soon to be wife was  lovely and great I like the background music they use.Also I love the music  &quot;it was compose by James Horner&quot;the music was my favorite so I  bought the soundtrack hehe!.So Paramount Studio has finally release  Braveheart on DVD I'm happy for that!is gonna be great!I own this movie on  VHS three years ago,maybe I might buy this on DVD too.&quot;BRAVO FOR MEL  GIBSON&quot;
B000002KCC|5.0|listening to this album gives one a definite idea of helplessness & despair. variously this has been noted by other neil young fans who reviews here before me & they are right. this is music exorcism at its finest. it purges your sense of guilt & it helps you understand what life is. <br />in a drugged out state, singing with so much humanity, this album actually empowers with sorrow & pain.
068484267X|5.0|I loved this book so much.  I have never read about such poverty before and it was an eye opener.  Frank McCourt sounds like a person I would like to meet, share a &quot;pint&quot; and talk.  I had to also get the  follow-up book &quot;Tis.&quot;  I liked it even better and can't imagine  skipping that book after reading Angela's Ashes.&quot;
B000000OUJ|3.0|I heard that this was the best Wu-Tang solo album EVER. But it just wasn't as good as I had expected. I loved the old Ninja movie clips, they were great. The album starts out with a little girl telling the story about her fathers association with the Shaolin ninjas and the song that follows,  (named after the album), &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; is okay, but not  amazing. That is sort of the way to describe the album, in my opinion. I  think that the GZA has some good lyrics and has great guests on the album,  but all the beats sound somemwhat similar. I think that the GZA is  underrated for his lyrical skills, but I don't think that this album is  SPECTACULAR. I would probably give it four stars if it hadn't got my hopes  up. Instead, I'll give it 3 1/2 stars.
B0000026NC|3.0|The obligatory live double disc from Floyd's 'comeback' 1987/88 tour is without a doubt sometimes pretty painful to listen to. This isn't an unbearably putrid album, but nevertheless the sound mixing and some of  Gilmour's floundering vocals leave much to be desired. In truth, this was a  disappointment for those awaiting any live Pink Floyd album. Their  first(and last, up till this point) live album was the live disc of their  double 'Ummagumma' album, which was a too-short, 4-track set of early  material. The only other live Floyd album to feature Roger Waters is the  new 'Is There Anybody Out There', which is 'The Wall' live, released twenty  years after the fact. Which gives us this, a rather lackluster first double  live set of old faves and new material. (Incidently, I believe Pink Floyd  should have released a live album from their 'Animals' tour. At that point  they were riding high on their three 'classic' pre-Wall albums 'Dark  Side...', 'Wish You Were Here' and 'Animals' and such a double album from  this period would have captured the pre-Wall Waters period at its peak,  featuring classic Floyd up to that point). Instead, this. Besides the sound  quality and some uninspired vocal parts, 'Time' cuts off the 'Breathe'  reprise section, which ruins the song somewhat, and 'Learning To Fly' just  sounds pale, to say the least. Some of the performance just seems forced. A  good helping of the 'Momentary Lapse Of Reason' album is featured here,  though, and the disc features 'Us &amp; Them', which wasn't on the original  vinyl. Pink Floyd would achieve better results on the 1995 'Pulse' live  album, which is an incredibly solid live set with way improved vocals and  sound, plus the entire 'Dark Side...' performed live as well as 'Astronomy  Domine' and a lot of 'Division Bell'. Start with that for live Floyd.
B000002NHN|5.0|...I was first introduced to McKennitt's work through a friend who listens to radio broadcasts done through a website.  As a result of those broadcasts, he ordered this album along with The Mask and Mirror and  Parallel Dreams.  Unfortunately Parallel Dreams was out of stock where he  ordered it, but The Mask and Mirror came; we've heard some of the  selections from Parallel Dreams on the broadcast as well.  Although I could  be considered a &quot;newbie&quot; at least I'm willing to hear her other  works.  I'm listening to The Mask &amp; Mirror right now, and to me I can  see the progression from this album to TBOS.  I hear a lot of Middle  Eastern influence in Marrakesh Night Market that turns up later in Marco  Polo.  Full Circle and Two Trees hints to Dante's Prayer. Any true artist  understands it's the journey and not the final result (be it song or  painting, or in my case, film) that matters the most; I can see a journey  from The Mask &amp; Mirror to TBOS.  Possibly the fact that this album  seems much more polished is why it also seems to be a sellout, but it's  not.  The little diary entries show the progression of how the ideas for  this album came together; it's interesting to see an artist's gradual  journey to the creation and I also like the fact that some are dated two to  three years before this album was recorded.  Good ideas sometimes take a  long time to realize themselves.  It seems to me unfair to pigeonhole  McKennitt and say &quot;She's a Celtic musician, so she should only do  Celtic music&quot;, like I've seen in some reviews.  I think of her as a  world musician who is comfortable doing music of any type, but possibly  prefers Celtic music or the Celts as her influence (and since the Celts  ranged from Ireland through most of Europe and probably had contact with  the Middle East how can you possibly define &quot;Celtic&quot;?).   McKennitt is definitely eclectic; could anyone really define her style?  I  would not compare her to Enya at all, they are two different people and  have two different styles, and it's almost impossible to compare two  musicians who are at opposite ends of the pole stylistically.... I listen to music that speaks  to me and moves me, and I often listen to music that no one else likes, so  if others don't think this album is good that's fine with me.  I think  people should accept it on their own terms, not on someone else's. PS.  Dante's Prayer had me crying. For some reason it had me thinking of my  father and how eventually he'll be dying from Alzheimer's.  Don't ask me  why.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|A feature about Baraka on IMDB led me here to Amazon - I'm seriously contemplating buying a DVD player solely to see Baraka again.  I've seen it only once (in a theatre) and ever since, I've been raving about this film  to anyone who'll listen.  But the reviewers complaining about poor image  quality on the DVD are giving me the heebie-jeebies.  How can the opinion  of the image quality vary so greatly?  I'll wait and see a few more reviews  before I make my purchase...
B00004T9UF|3.0|First off, I have to address something because it really annoys me when people don't have their facts straight: THE SLIM SHADY LP WAS NOT EMINEM'S DEBUT ALBUM!   It's a shame more people don't know this, and perhaps if  they did, they would also appreciate what a waste of talent Eminem's latest  album is.<br />Eminem is a supremely talented MC.  However, this has yet to  manifest itself in a complete, substantial album.  His latest is, to be  perfectly blunt, pop crap.  The hooks are horrible, and Dr. Dre is simply  not the groundbreaking producer he once was.  He does still know how to  make hits, though, so if you like catchy, meaningless music, pick this up.   The current state of Hip Hop makes me want to cry.  I don't even feel like  writing a more thorough review.
0800132343|5.0|After hearing of it for three years, I finallysaid what the hey, and rented this movie and for three and a half hours, I was blown away. the camera work, effects, and performances were all superior. If you liked  U-571, this one will knock you through the wall. A phenomenal film.
B0000214F0|4.0|Caligula, one of the most controversial movies ever made, is now available on DVD.  This film was a real eye-opener for me, and the DVD is far superior to the VHS that was floating around a bit in the '80s (for all you  people complaining about the quality, just shudder to think of how it used  to be).  The story of Rome's infamous emperor was probably not this wild in  real life, but this is Penthouse and as a result is chockablock with sexual  scenes and graphic violence.  Because Caligula is basically in every single  scene, it's hard for the other characters to develop, but there are some  colorful supporting players, and McDowell really delivers.  It's hard to  believe his next film was to play the reserved, scholarly H.G. Wells  (&quot;Time After Time.&quot;)  He is quite a talented actor.  The movie  drags on and on, and sometimes the cinematography is uncertain, but other  times it is dead on the money.  The film is a bit grainy on DVD, but as  someone else once said, this really contributes to the &quot;gritty&quot;  factor.  As far as realism, many of the sex scenes look real, but I doubt  the world has ever seen the likes of that purple-skinned four-eyed (or was  it three-eyed?) woman, plus the guy with all those extra digits and the  siamese twins joined at the head resting at Tiberius' palace.  And how  about the scene where Caligula &quot;consecrates&quot; that marriage...if  that's how it was, I'd never get married.  <br />The DVD has these things  going for it: the creepy music added to the menu (the same as the opening  title with the quote from Mark), the 30 chapters nicely divided up, the  documentary about the making of featuring Gore Vidal and Bob Guccione  (although in places everyone's face looked way too pale, but it was an old  '70s film), and the sound is far superior to the VHS from what I can  remember.  <br />But this is Caligula and I would definitely not let anyone  under 18 (or maybe even 21) watch it.
B00000163G|5.0|All eyez on Me is an awesome cd. First of all there are so many great songs on it that all have phat beats. Also, Tupac is the master at great sonding lyrics and rhymes. Some of the standout songs on the album are:  &quot;Only God can Judge Me&quot;, &quot;All Bout U&quot;, &quot;Can't C  Me&quot;, and &quot;Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find&quot;. Each song has a  distinct beat and is different from other songs. This album rules and it is  my favorite album I own. Tupac is just so awesome in all of these tracks  the way he can just shoot off lyrics. I would recomend this album to anyone  because it shows everyone what real  rap is. Buy All Eyez on Me, (at your  local Target store.)
B00004RHZU|3.0|I like the CD, from what I;ve heard (I'm listening to it now).  If you heard There You Go on the radio and kinda liked it, it grows on you more after you get the CD.  I like that one and #5 the best, #6 and #8 are also  good.  :)
B00004SCX6|4.0|I'm not a huge, crazed fan of Britney Spears, but I do like some of her music. She has a pretty good voice... here's what I thought of her CD... Ooops! I did it again.<br />1. I think it's about time that she released  another album.<br />2. The songs are good, but I'm noticing a pattern in her  music. She's trying to copy the popular music style, but that isn't  entirely bad. <br />3. Has anyone noticed that her first track on her first  album is pretty similar to the first track on this album? Oops I did it  again and Baby One More Time are similar, in  my mind.<br />Some of the songs  (not in order): *Oops, I did it again: This is a good song with a catchy  beat, but like I said before, it's similar to &quot;Baby One More  Time.&quot; Also, I think the part where the guy gives her the necklace  from Titanic is a little bit corny, and she should do some vocals there  instead, because she's just talking.<br />*Stronger: Really liked this song!  It was a little bit different than her other songs, which she needed on the  album. This also is a good dance beat and kind of catches your attention  when you hear it.<br />*Don't Go Knockin' On My Door: Well, this song was  okay, but I think in the very beginning, it was a copy of Destiny's  Child... their style of music. This wasn't one of my favorite songs on the  album.<br />*Satisfaction (I Can't Get No): This is an interesting variation  of the song, but I think nobody can copy the Rolling Stones. It's a good  song, and it's better than I thought it would be. But, I don't really like  when people copy old classics, because I think writing your own lyrics is  what being a musician is about.<br />*Lucky: This song starts out like it's  from the 50s, but it gets really good. It's about a singer (which i think  is supposed to be Britney) who has millions of dollars and fans, but is  really lonely.<br />*What U See (Is What U Get): One of my favorites on the  album. I like the words, and also the melody and beat of the song.<br />*Can't  Make You Love Me: This is also a good song- I really liked it. But it also  reminds me of &quot;Crazy&quot; on her other album.<br />*Where Are You Now:  This is a pretty good song, a little sappy, but I liked it. Some of the  lyrics are a little corny, though- i found that in some of her songs on  this album.<br /> I won't have room to write about all of the songs, but those  are most of them. I really liked this CD, though I think her first album  was a little bit better. Definitely buy this CD.
B00004STUL|1.0|I saw Bad Boys (not to be confused with Bad Boys starring Sean Penn and Esai Morales, which is a really good movie) and hated it.  The movie was to loud, it was like watching a bad MTV video, and I find Martin Lawrence to  be incredibly irritating. I know a lot of people will not care for my  comments, but we are all entitled to our opinions.  If you're looking for  good cop/buddy movies, any of the Lethal Weapon entries blows away this  film.
B000002U82|5.0|This is the best classic rock cd, I have enjoyed how every song is written in poems, the guitar solos in between versus are excellent the lyrics and the music together make you think it is an intelligent cd, better than Led  Zeppelin IV by far. I enjoy listen to this even if it is very slow it is  thought provoking. Best Songs: Time, Money.
6302597544|4.0|I usually don't like live performances, but this one was really pretty good. The songs are all top-quality and the guys look like they're all having a blast on stage. A very energetic show.
B00003CXDD|4.0|I originally saw this movie when I was in 9th. grade. It is still one of my favorite movies of all time. I even read the sequel novels by George Lucas and Chris Claremont and it just brought back so many memories of when  I saw it in the theater. I just hope it comes out in VHS soon, because I  don't have a DVD player.
B00004SCX6|4.0|&quot;Oops! I Did It Again&quot; is a good CD. The songs are more girl-power oriented than the first CD. The majority of songs is about the girl telling a guy exactly what she is. For example, &quot;What U See (Is  What U Get)&quot; is telling a guy that she's not going to change for him.  There's also the title track, which is more, playful. The girl is kind of  playing with the guy's head. Then there's &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Don't  Go Knockin' On My Door&quot; and &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot;.  The first two are about breaking up and not regretting it. &quot;(I Can't  Get No) Satisfaction) is really good. It's about knowing what you want.  However, there are softer songs like &quot;Dear Diary&quot; which is about  seeing a guy and really liking him.
6305364613|5.0|WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE`S ROMEO + JULIET is by far the best Shakespeare adaption of the screen. Baz Luhrmann`s production is lush and the chemistry of acting, production design, costume, sets, sound and music is  spellbounding. This film is repeatadely a treat and borrows its premises  from MTV. But it works and it works fine. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his magic  best. It takes u back to the &quot;sweet&quot; age of your teens when love  was first discovered and u thought that no one could have experienced the  trauma of this crazy feeling more A L I V E then urself... This film brings  back that feeling. It may be my favorite film...
B00000BKDW|5.0|I started listening to Iron Maiden 2 years ago. My first album was &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;. A classic one (although it isn't their best). After two months, I bought &quot;Powerslave&quot;. When I listened to the  album first time, I understood that the band was in their peak. With no  synthesizers or pianos, this is a really great album. Maybe their best.  Why? Because it has the songs which have always been the HISTORY of Iron  Maiden. What songs? Of course, Aces High (maybe the greatest riff of ALL  the Maiden songs, it is (almost) for headbanging!), 2 Minutes To Midnight  (Another classic which is in the &quot;Best Of The Beast&quot; 2-cd pack.  Great Harmonies), Losfer Words (Maybe the best instrumental (great melody  and riff) by Maiden), Flash Of The Blade (I don't understand why this song  isn't in the &quot;Best Of The Beast&quot; cd. I like it more than 2  Minutes To Midnight), Powerslave (Words are unable to describe this  M-a-s-t-e-r-p-i-e-c-e) and Rime Of The Ancient Mariner (This is one of my  favourite Maiden songs. It has great riff and amazing lyrics, it is almost  a story. I prefer that live). Don't try to describe this with other Maiden  albums (only with &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot; and &quot;The Number Of The  Beast&quot;. A MUST HAVE for all the Maiden and Heavy Metal fans. This is  my best album (Along with &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot;. Iron Maiden is the  best Heavy Metal band (along Judas Priest and Motorhead) in my opinion.  So...? Do you are still here?  Go and buy it NOW! It's worth buying and  you WON'T be dissapointed.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Sing this to the tune of the chorus in Ghost of the Navigator:<br />Take my heart and set it free, Cast Kid Rock into the sea. Manson is a skank, Korn should walk the plank, Let the sharks feast on Britney.<br />Keelhaul Limp  Bizkit today, Flog 'N Sync without delay. The Spice Girls are wh0res, Chain  them to the oars, And send the ship far, far away.<br />THE CASE FOR MUSICAL  JUSTICE IN THIS WORLD:  The general reaction to this album is  overwhelmingly positive, with a decidedly small presence of people who  think that a band is as good as dead after three albums and that the new  stuff can never touch the old (any band that has been around for more than  two years has idiot fans like that).<br />THE CASE AGAINST MUSICAL JUSTICE IN  THIS WORLD:  In the USA, this CD was released on the same day as Kid Rock's  &quot;History of Rock&quot;.  Anyone care to guess which CD was bought by  merchants and consumers in obscene quantities with its own in-store display  while the other was nonchalantly crammed into the bin with all of the  artist's previous releases?<br />I think the Case Against carries more weight  than the Case For.  Alas, the war against musical incompetence is being  fought by far too few.<br />Brave New World is an incredibly solid release.   Iron Maiden could probably have made a killing in sales to the sheeplike by  adopting that astoundingly obnoxious rap-with-guitars sound that people  can't seem to get enough of these days.  Instead, they turned out ten  true-to-form tracks reminiscent of the material on Somewhere In Time and  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (all hail 9-minute songs).  The Wicker Man is  the hit single, The Nomad and Dream of Mirrors are the epics, and Ghost of  the Navigator is the song that single-handedly renewed my will to live in a  world upon which the musically inferior (in both skill and taste) are  dominant.  If Korn and their ilk ever form their own independent nation,  raise a massive army of clueless MTV junkies, and conquer the Earth, I  shall simply lock myself in a windowless underground room and play Ghost of  the Navigator until I die of dehydration, rather than pulling a  Cobain.<br />If you're already a Maiden fan, chances are you already own this  CD.  If you're not a Maiden fan, then chances are I'm not going to convert  you.  So instead, I merely say:<br />1.  Up the Irons, and<br />2.  Join the War  Against Musical Incompetence (W.A.M.I.) if you don't want your children and  your children's children to grow up listening to what somebody else wants  them to listen to (as of yet there is no official War Against Somebody  Else, but I'm working on it).
6305077630|5.0|Critics be damned!  Weird Science is just plain belly laugh funny.  One of the greatest scenes in 80's cinema is the bar room scene.  There are more quotable lines in that scene alone than in the rest of the film.  Anthony  Michael Hall is GREAT, Bill Paxton is hilarious...the movie just resonates  with a fun attitude.<br />Critics who question the artistic merits of the  movie are missing the point.  It's FUNNY!  I only OWN my favorite movies on  DVD...Shawshank, Young Frankenstein, Amadeus, Sixth Sense, Psycho...and  Weird Science.

If you want revenge on your kitchen, Bourdain  will give it to you. With humor, wit, and a tiny pinch of  &quot;nastiness&quot;. You will laugh your head off as you read this book.  But you will also wonder why you kept doing stupid things with useless  utensils that would make a good yard sale. Boudain is the Ralph Nader of<br />culinary pleasures. And he is so funny. After reading the book for fun  and pleasure, I can feel my kitchen &quot;quiver&quot; in fear. Some things  are just plain stupid and others are not. This man is an expert and he  knoweth of what he speaks. Thank you so much.
0446677450|5.0|I purchased this book at the Palm Springs Airport and read it on the plane up to Seattle.  It is an easy read and very enjoyable.  Most of the things he claims his &quot;rich&quot; dad said were very familiar to me.  I heard  them as a boy working beside my Father in his business and at the kitchen  table. <br />If you are one of the middle class working slaves, my heart goes  out to you.  Good luck in your effort to take control of your financial  well being.  This book can give you some insight, but it isn't a how to  book in the sense that it gives you the theory, but not the procedures.   The procedure is covered generally but is left up to the reader to  determine for themselves.  You can do it just like he says.  I bought it  because I wanted to know what Rich Dads taught their kids.  I didn't  realize I already knew.  My Dad taught me.  Oh, by the way, he is rich too!
0446677450|5.0|God Bless Kiyosaki. Things change. And we have to change with them. Most people, I am sorry to say, are way behind. They are like old record players.  On and on and on. &quot;Graduate from college, get a job, buy a  home, on and on&quot;. This formula will not work anymore. And if you spoon  feed it to your children, uh-oh. Buy this book and simply get updated to  the new finacial world. As Kiyosaki brillantly points out, the really  important thing is to be able to fall back on investments. And this is of  the most utmost importance. As I read this book, I could see that Kiyosaki  can't really see into the future. But he does know the realities of our  situation today. In seems that more and more people are simply going to  live off their investments. If you acquire one million dollars and receive  10% interest, you will receive $100,000 before taxes yearly. Why are we  having our children going to college on a $50,000 loan without  understanding the realities that Kiyosaki espouses in this simply  &quot;must-buy-read-and-FOLLOW&quot; book. Save your children from falling  into the antiquated money trap that NO LONGER EXISTS. Kiyosaki also seems a  bit worried about the future where a two-class system exists. One in which  people are living off their investments. And another which consists of  people working for $6 an hour. Think of it. It is happening before our eyes  and seems more like a science fiction novel. But the book and save yourself  a great deal of possible future misery.
B00000J6AG|2.0|&quot;Play&quot; is a collage of gospel samples mixed with some beginner-level piano work (think of the piano on &quot;New Year's Day&quot; by U2 and you have a rough idea of the technical level of Moby's keyboard  work), some percussion and bass tracks, with some corny lyrics thrown in.   Surprisingly, it works.  I found myself humming along and tapping my foot.   <br />But this work ultimately lacks imagination, and this is its main  weakness.  Remember the bins of used CD's by bands like Live or Crash Test  Dummies?  Yeah, they were very popular bands, and wrote catchy tunes, and  sold lots of CDs. In the true flash-in-the-pan tradition, advertisers have  licensed Moby's tracks, exactly because they are so catchy. But when you  listen to this album, the tunes don't last a merciful 30 seconds like they  do on TV. Instead, they last minutes, some of those minutes being very  long. <br />So though this album holds some initial interest, it holds up  poorly to repeated play, making the listener switch to other CDs like  &quot;Future Sounds of Jazz Vol-5&quot; (with 20 artists, most of them more  talented than Moby), or Kruder and Dorfmeister, or Amon Tobin, or We, or...  you get the idea. Moby didn't invent the art form of sampling and mixing,  and many others have come up with more interesting ideas and better music.   I'm not talking about far-out experimental music, either.  I mean that  there are people who laid down the groundwork and put together very  listenable music that doesn't get worn out after 3 sessions of digital to  analog conversion.<br />Buy this album only if you like safe pop tunes with a  kind of DJ feel to them.  Even then, you may tire of &quot;Play.&quot; If  you are looking for illbient, trance, or acid jazz you may find yourself  returning your Moby CD to the local record store, where it will take its  place on a rack with all the other pre-owned copies of &quot;Play.&quot;
B00000K0DV|4.0|In my opinion, Lucio Fulci's &quot;New York Ripper&quot; is as every bit perverse and deranged as his later &quot;Dangerous Obsession&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Devil's Honey.&quot;<br />A burned-out New York City cop gets stuck  on a case where a madman is chopping and slashing up young, beautful women;  hookers, models, athletes, sex-show performers and anything else the blade  can touch. If a &quot;normal&quot; director was given this cliche`  storyline, this film would be not much more than another murder-mystery.  However, Fulci takes &quot;homicide&quot; to a whole new level without his  classic use of zombies or the supernatural. Fucli even has a bit role as  the Police chief and is dubbed with a rather amusing Yankee accent.<br />The  Anchor Bay DVD print is beautiful and properly letterboxed.<br />Packed with  plenty of S&amp;M, nudity and arguably the some of the most convincing gore  in Fulci's 20-year directing career, this is one horror/giallo film that  will NEVER make it past the BBFC. Check it out!
0782008372|3.0|Believe what the reviews are saying.  This DVD is of noticeably bad  quality,  with a grainy, pixilated image.  It distracts from the enjoyment  of the film, and the VHS tape is of higher quality.<br />That being said, at a  mere $7, this DVD is worth the purchase.  Highlander is a great film and  the directors cut adds some interesting, if not always high quality,  footage.  There is a reason the WWII scene wound up on the floor.  But it  is still fun to watch.  The production stills are nice, and you get to see  some of the famous &quot;lost scene&quot; of the Asian immortal.  Other DVD  extras justify the small price tag, with an audio commentary by Russel  Mulchay.<br />I enjoyed it, but I would have felt robbed at full DVD price
630516889X|4.0|For sure a guys's movie, chocked full of mindless violence.  An intriguing story line: what if mankind was not the masters of the universe?<br />Arnold, Bill Duke, Jesse The Body, Sonny Landham and Carl Weathers were reportedly  up early every day trying to outdo each other on the big screen in the  macho department, and it shows.  Classic macho lines, of course starting  with &quot;I ain't got time to bleed&quot; and &quot;If it bleeds, we can  kill it&quot;. Guns aplenty, with Jesse taking the lead with his hand  carried gattling gun.  Thousands of bullets shot, dozens of people and one  Predator killed.<br />Less than the full five stars, though, because as my  Bride says, it is one of the more visually repulsive movies ever made.   Even moreso, the second half of the film (when most of Arnold's team have  been killed off, and the fight becomes  mano a beast) slows down.  Of  course, for the Predator to kill itself in the end cheats us humans out of  the retribution we all want.

B000002U82|5.0|The Golden Age of rock music is framed at the beginning in 1963 with the (British only) release of the Beatles' *Please Please Me*, and ten years later at the other end with this album, *The Dark Side of the Moon,* a  monumental achievement that, like *Sgt. Pepper's* before it, transcends its  time. *Dark Side of the Moon* stands, along with the two or three best  Beatles albums, at the zenith of rock artistry, and it has since  established a standard for what has been referred to as &quot;art  rock&quot; that has yet to be surpassed. In the history of rock and popular  music, there are only about a dozen albums that stand as peers to this one.  Consider this essential to any music library, for it is lyrically,  musically, and thematically a true masterpiece. If you want to start your  Pink Floyd collection, this is where you begin. Indeed, if you are planning  to build a library of classic rock from the beginning, choose either this  or *Sgt. Pepper's* - either way you will have the very best in your  collection.
0812523334|4.0|I read Little Women after having seen the movie. I enjoyed the book alot.<br />Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the  these &quot;little women&quot; as you read. <br />But don't forget loving  Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.<br />I  devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only  part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well  the letters were a bit boring.<br />There are so many memorable moments in  this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and  humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and  Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women.
B000002UB6|5.0|*Let It Be* often unfairly receives lukewarm reviews because it is not a great album by the standards of the Beatles. It is not in the same league as *Sgt. Pepper* or *Revolver*, or indeed, a good half-dozen other Beatles  recordings. However, when compared to rock and pop albums in general, this  record is better than 100% of the material produced by 95% of the groups  around today. If we were to judge it against the standards of the rest of  the Beatle's catalogue, it might rate 2 stars, 3 stars at best; but against  all albums, it uneqivocally deserves 5 stars.      Originally conceived as  material for a back to roots album tentatively titled *Get Back*, the  Beatles quickly became frustrated by the newly emerged internal conficts  experienced against the back drop of the &quot;cavernous Twickenham sound  stage.&quot; Throughout the majority of the group's existence, they worked  as an almost mystically coherent and cohesive unit - right through the  phenomenal *Sgt. Pepper's* sessions and the &quot;All You Need is  Love&quot; single, the Beatles worked almost as one mind (in spite of  different individual proclivities among the four members). Things began to  unravel upon the return from India in the summer of 1968, and the first  real conflict occured during the landmark *&quot;White Album&quot;*  sessions. When they returned to the studio in January of 1968 to record the  &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, the Beatles were under the strain of  individual conflict and group discontent. Only one year earlier, the  Beatles were as tight as a band could hope to be, but now they were  beginning to experience an unfamiliar disunity.   Against this background,  and the emotion and confusion that springs from such situations, the  Beatles attempted to film the recording of their new songs, with the dual  intention of making a new album and preparing for a return to the concert  stage. Tensions were high, nerves frayed, the setting unfamiliar, and the  plan undefined. Nonetheless, in spite of all this, the musicianship and  songwriting strength of the Beatles cannot help but shine through.     The  album's high points are John &amp; Paul's &quot;Two of Us,&quot; Paul's  &quot;Let It Be,&quot; and a re-mix of John's &quot;Across the  Universe,&quot; a song which was not actually a part of the Get Back  project but resurrected from an earlier session recorded nearly two years  before these events. &quot;Two of Us&quot; is a hauntingly honest and quiet  meditation on the current state of John and Paul's friendship: lines such  as &quot;two of us standing solo, chasing paper, on our way home,&quot; and  &quot;you and I have memories, longer than the road that stretches out  ahead,&quot; sung in harmony by the artists that constitute one of music's  greatest songwriting partnerships, provides poignant insight into how they  were really feeling about their newly strained relationship. It is as  touching as any Beatles song written, cleanly performed without Phil  Spector's heavy-handed production, and achieving almost a spiritual  resignation to the events that remained ahead of them. &quot;Let It  Be&quot; speaks for itself - this is Paul McCartney at his very best, a  gifted melodists, confident lyricist, and moving vocalist - a song that  confirms his remarkable musical talent and justifies his enormous stature.  Of the three songs, the best is Lennon's &quot;Across the Universe.&quot;  In its original conception (from 1967), &quot;Across the Universe&quot;  might just be the Beatles most beautiful song ever. John Lennon takes us to  the sublime, lyrically and melodically, and as it is originally recorded,  the rest of the group contribute magnificently to this effect. I strongly  recommend listening to the version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; that  is now available on *Beatles Anthology Two* - it is by far the best of the  three versions of this song, a truly uplifting (both artistically and  spriritually) accomplishment. The other version is available on *Past  Master's II*, and while it is interesting and light-hearted, it does not  capture the sublimity of the original conception. The version that is  offered here, on *Let It Be*, is still good, and perhaps the album's best  moment, but it is inferior in comparison to Lennon's original idea. The  problem is Spector: his &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; is great for the  Ronette's, but it misses the whole point of Beatle's artistry - and skirts  on the edge of overproduction. Still, it was endorsed by Lennon himself  upon hearing it, and it is a great song no matter how you dress it.    The  rest of the album is solid, but not as consistent as most Beatle  recordings. &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; originally recorded with  Paul at piano, George on a subdued lead guitar, and John on bass guitar  should have been left alone as it was (&quot;get back&quot; right?). If one  listens to the version on *Anthology Three* you get a better sense of the  song's depth. Spector's instrumentation and arrangement almost ruin the  song - and I often program around it since hearing the song as Paul  originally conceived it. George's contributions are fine - not as great as  what he brought to the White Album or would later bring to *Abbey Road,*  but delightful just the same (although, again, &quot;I, Me, Mine,&quot;  suffers from Spector's meddling). &quot;One After 909&quot; and  &quot;I've  Got a Feeling,&quot; &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; are all good fun, and *Get  Back*, a great rock and roll song by any standard, brings the album to a  fittingly up-tempo finale.     As stated above, this is not the Beatles  finest work, it isn't even close, but it is still strong all the way  through, in spite of the tension in the group and Phil Spector's  inappropriate production. Most group's would kill to create something half  as good as this, the Beatles did it almost as an afterthought.
B00003CX95|5.0|As an avid movie watcher, I have seen many films, yet Braveheart has my nod as the best ever. It has a bit of everything, from war to love, from revenge to compassion. While not historically accurate, it was not meant to  be. Randall Wallace, writer of this film and the book it was based on said,  &quot;I didnt want the facts to get in the way of the truth.&quot;  That  the movie doesnt qualify for playing on the History channel doesnt mean it  isnt a great movie. If you have not seen this movie, buy it now, and play  it. I watch it quite often, and it has never gotten dull or old.
6303477259|5.0|First of all Pink Floyd is my all-time favorite band. David Gilmour is a genius, amazing artist, singer, and musician.  &quot;Pulse&quot; is the culmination of ALL of what makes Pink Floyd so spectacular.  Their music is  awesome but their live show is SIMPLY THE BEST YOU WILL EVER SEE! It has  the most impressive lighting (complete with lasers), and special effects of  any concert I've been to! (I've seen at least 50 popular bands.) Hats off  to Marc Brickman, the lighting designer as well as the director, David  Mallet and everyone involved in this great video production! Also, the  giant screen which plays video footage is definitely worth mentioning;  however, I'll save all the other numerous surprises for you to enjoy as you  watch this!<br />What impresses me the most about Pink Floyd is they keep  getting better!  I saw this concert live and it's their tour for the  awesome &quot;Division Bell&quot; CD; which is my favorite of all their  work! That says alot looking at their enormous portfolio through the  years!<br />The approximate running time is 145 minutes; and you'll be on the  edge of your seat the whole time!  This video is a must own if you are a  Pink Floyd fan and if you can only afford one--this is it! It has all their  old great ones like &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Us and  Them&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;  plus their newer ones from &quot;THE DIVISION BELL&quot;: the great  &quot;High Hopes&quot;, &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot;, &quot;Take it  Back&quot; and &quot;Keep Talking.&quot;<br />I hope they &quot;keep  talking&quot; because I'll always be listening!
0780626478|5.0|This movie is great.  I really like all the performances (Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christorpher Walken, Sissy Spacek, and Dave Foley) and thought the whole movie was just excellent.  It's both funny and touching  and is just a hip, feel good comedy that I just can't stop watching.  If  you like comedies with heart, get &quot;Blast From the Past&quot;.

0767819594|5.0|I'm going to make this short and to the point.  &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; is a great movie.  The performances, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Philippe, Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Joshua Jackson, as  well as Christin Baranski and Swoosie Kurtz, are all great and fun to  watch.   If you liked &quot;Dangerous Liasons&quot; you'll love this hip  remake as well.
B000002HMH|4.0|I was always a fan of &quot;old&quot; Metallica. That is, the Kill Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, ...And Justice For All Metallica. I thought the new stuff, mainly Load and Reload, sucked. I was very ignorant for hating two albums I new nothing about. But my curiosity drew me to  borrow Load from my friend. I let the whole thing play through. About an  hour and twenty minutes later (long CD, my friend), I thought It was ok.  Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. But as I listened to it more, the  better it got. It was a nice break from the sometimes repetitive old  albums. I took off a star because, unlike the old albums, not every song is  good. I can't get into Cure, Ronnie, Wasting my Hate. But the rest of the  album ranges from good to excellent, the excellent being the two epics  Bleeding Me and The Outlaw Torn, the dark The House Jack Built..... and the heavy Black Albumish King Nothing.
6305089957|3.0|I waited months for this movie.  I counted down the days to opening, and when I saw it on that opening day I left the theater wondering why I even bothered anticipating it.  Don't get me wrong this is better than such  recent horror flicks as &quot;Idle Hands&quot; and &quot;The Haunting&quot;  and was a better sequel than &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last  Summer&quot;, which had an even worse ending than this one, but it just  didn't live up to the name &quot;Scream&quot;.  If you liked the first, get  this one, but don't expect the level of its predecessor.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When I decided to buy this movie on PPV I was just curious.  I had heard from a friend that this was not just an action movie, so I wanted to check it out for myself.  I am very glad I did.  This movie was one of those that  I didn't want to see in the theater for fear of being thought of as a  blood-thirsty primate.  Sure, the film had some gore scenes that make you  cringe at times, but those scenes are needed to set the right mood for the  story.  I don't think the ending was a &quot;cop-out&quot; either.  How can  any writers original vision be a cop-out?
B0000024RZ|5.0|A gaunt and bony-faced Bob stares out austerely from the cover, trying to resemble a Walker Evans depression-era photograph, and doing a pretty good job at that. These are THE classic 'protesty songs of his protest years',  and overwhelmingly powerful they are too, building up from the attention-  grabbing title song to culminate in the engrossing human tragedy of Hattie  Carroll, the black maid beaten to death by a drunken socialite. Dylan's own  mixture of fear and commitment is a noticably intriguing counterpoint to  the strong political rhetoric. His usual `restless feet' imagery in `One  Too Many Mornings' neatly contrasts with crumbling social stability of  `North Country Blues'. Even in `Oxford Town' his campaigning is cut short  by the urge to get out of the heat. By the end, the `Restless Farewell' to  activism is starkly set against the personalising of oppression in the  story of Carroll and the vile Zanzinger. Both these final songs are  hypnotic - perfect examples of Dylan's subtle development of his old  technique of hanging onto, and drawing out lines so that resolutions seem  suspended in mid-air, and endings seem like blessed moments of release.  <br />What is most impressive, is that these mid-60s protest-songs seem  neither dated, nor `politically correct' in any way. Instead they recreate  the real and intense sense of injustice and fear of destruction that  dominated the era.
6301966562|5.0|This movie is one of the sweetiest films I have ever seen. Everything is so sweet, even the soundtrack of the film is great! The story is about a young man who falls in love with his beautiful neightbor. The problem is  that he's not the only one, he has to face his... computer (!)  which  suddenly starts understanding and even talking! The film is a big success  of the 80's. It combines perfectly fantasy with comedy. The whole result is  a unique film! Lots of people fall in love with computers (some even more)  when they saw this wonderful movie! I really enjoyed it as well as many  other people and I want to see it over and over again! That's how much I  like it! Great moments of the film, the moment that Edgar (that's how the  computer is being called!) tries to copy the music of tselo which the girl  plays and Edgar's revenge... The only thing it made me sad on this film was  the end of it, but even that, despite Edgar's destruction, seems finally to  be good; Edgar is somehow still &quot;alive&quot; and the &quot;Together in  electric dreams&quot; is being heard flooding the film... Talking now about  the soundtrack is one of these that made this film so sweet. It was created  by great composers and singers, like Giorgio Moroder (who composed the  excellent soundtrack of Midnight Express, too), Philip Oakey, Culture Club,  Jeff Lynne (by Electric Light Orchestra) and many others. Giorgio Moroder  composed some very nice instrumental pieces (&quot;The Duel&quot; is so  nice!) and one other with the singer Philip Oakey (&quot;Together in  electric dreams&quot;, one of the greatest pieces of the soundtrack, if not  the greatest). Culture Club offer a very nice love song (&quot;Love is  love&quot;, another great song too) and Jeff Lynne's &quot;Video&quot;  completes the best pieces of soundtrack. Some other pieces are nice too...  Totally, the film is must seeing and I suggest it to everyone.  Even if you  don't like computers, you will sure have a better idea about them as soon  as you see this brilliant movie! Don't miss it at all!
6305903182|4.0|I thought the movie was pretty good, i think it is the scariest of the three, but not the funniest or cleveries of the mainly the first one, second one ok.The beginning of the movie was a shock to me, however i  thought the end was ok little surprising but was looking for more of a  surprise like with the first killing of the beginning of the film had.  But  overall very good movie, better than 2, not scream 1, it was a classic in  itself.
0517122707|5.0|This is simply the funniest novel I've ever read.  It's BRILLIANT!  Ok, I may be a bit biased because I'm from New Orleans.  But if you ever have any plans to visit that city, then read this book.  You'll learn more of it's  quirky people and their colorful lives from this book than any other.
0316777722|4.0|was taking this often hysterical (if uneven) collection of essays with me to jury duty.Judges seem to hate it when a juror laughs out loud for no apparent reason...until the judge is familair with the wonderful David  Sedaris.<br />No doubt many reviewers will say that the first half of the  book, which deals mainly with David and his father, is much more amusing  than Part deux, which deals primarily with his life as the village idiot in  France. Pay little attention. The second half pales ONLY because the first  part of the book is practically flawless. <br />My personal favorite is the  chapter in which David's sister Amy (now seen on the Comedy Central Show  &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot;) comes home for Christmas wear half a fat  suit, driving their father crazy. Laugh-out-loud funny! <br />Sedaris is an  amazingly truthful writer. If he views the world, his family harshly, its  only because he values them so much. Throughout these stories, you find a  sense of wonderment and joy (well, maybe not so much with the giant turd  piece, but still...)
B00004T8RK|5.0|Every person who likes PJ should get this.  The guitars are great and Eddie's lyrics are brillant!  This is up there with Ten and Vs.!
B000002A3T|5.0|This is an excellent album. This album was painstakingly put together by people who care about the music. How can these so called critics put down the band as only doing it for the money when they produce work like this!  This was one of the best albums put out that year and it has a few songs  that rival their classics. I don't know of any other bands that are still  this inspiring after 40 years of being in the business. I hope that the new  Pink Floyd keeps it coming, even if it is a long time between albums  because the music is fabulous. Do you hear that guys? Please!
6302800420|5.0|I thought Mrs Doubtfire was good but then i saw this and discovered Mrs Doubtfire was just repeating every comedic act from this movie.Dustin Hoffman was funnier at doing a lady's voice than Robin Williams.i saw Mrs  D. before i saw Tootsie and i thought this movies funniest part would be  the part where she picks a wedgie which is kind of old but there were even  a lot of parts that werent even supposed to be funny but were anyway! this  movie could have very well been rated R for plenty of sexuality and tons of  language so this one is not for kids.this movie is still a  must-buy!
0553328255|5.0|Besides the obvious great things all of these stories contain, (deduction, cool cases, the cocaine) I think the best thing Conan Doyle provides is a fabulous charictor discription of Sherlock Holmes. He is, by far, one of  the most complicated charictors ever portrayed...even though it gets a  little monotonous when Watson says for the thousanth time: he was never  known to betray emotion of any kind, but... A GREAT read, and a book that  will entertain for years to come.
B00003A9QI|5.0|I was bowled over by this soundtrack.  It is absolutely stunning.  Simple yet lush, unpretentious yet poignant.  Words are just inadequate to describe the beauty and emotional impact of this music.  Easily my favorite  soundtrack of all time.

B00000JCB2|1.0|Limp Biskit should just stop.  Calling this good music is like calling paint fumes healthy.  Their music is the most immature music I ever heard.  No heart, no soul, no intelligence.  The lyrics could have been written by  me in 4th grade.  All Limp Biskit has going for them now is a seal of  approval by MTV.
B00000I9MK|5.0|If God came down and made a record. I think it would sound like this one. This album is one of the best albums to ever touch my Radio. It can be a little Uneven but it's better songs shine like the sun on a really hot day.  Even though Belle and sebastian would later go on to break my heart with  Boy with the Arab strap and fold your hands child. This is still a classic  in song writing and should be played to children around the world.
B00003CXFV|4.0|When i first saw this movie i went into the cinema with the word chick flick resting on my frontal lobe. I expected a pathetic excuse for Julia Roberts to cry but ended up with a good movie.  The movie has the David and  Goliath theme to it with Roberts battling the big bad company, while  managing to show an impressive amount of cleavage while doing so. Add some  funny one liners and good acting all around and you get a movie that you  dont mind having your girl friend drag you too.
0792101448|5.0|Sergio Leone's masterful western experience remains one of filmdom's most passionate creations.  Every frame is lovingly made to create a film that is mythical, enchanting, and poignant.  No other western is this  beautiful.<br />This is a mix of the imagined and the real aspects of the Old  West.  The good guys are easily recognized and the bad guys are really BAD!  Henry Fonda plays probably one of the most despical villains of all time.  He is one whose path one definitely would not want to cross.<br />Leone  basically designed the persona that Charles Bronson would have the rest of  his career: the lone, silent individual always on a quest for vengeance.  Bronson has many &quot;quiet&quot; scenes that are enhanced by the  memorable Ennio Morricone score.<br />Veteran character actors Jack Elam and  Woody Strode are brilliantly used in the opening credits which is worth the  viewing.  Claudia Cardinale is an intentional contrast as the sole female  in a cast of rugged guys.  Her beauty is illuminating to the stark grit of  the western settlement to which she returns.<br />Jason Robards, Jr. and  Lionel Stander round out the memorable character roles.<br />If Leone did so  well with the Old West, just think what he could have done with The Civil  War.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dr. Dre talks about many things on his new album.  Drugs, gangsters, h*es and b*itches, and many other things.  But he doesn't do it alone.  Sometimes it's hard to tell what rapper is what  on this album with so many  guest appearances in every song except the second.  The skits are good and  funny.  That would be Lolo, Bar-One, Pause For Porno, The Car Bomb, and  Ed-Ucation.  Well, I think there's more but I can't remember.  If you are a  kid don't buy this album, not even the edited version because it is all  butchered up.  I haven't heard it but I've heard this one and I guarentee  you it will be.  If you're a kid and like rap stick to Will Smith and Len,  and even some edited Eminem.  Even if you're parents don't care about  profanity, they will take this away quicker then you can say &quot;but  mmmmmooooooommmmmm&quot;.  Dre's rappng sounds different.  The beats are  cool.  Dre sounds older.  Well he hasn't released an album since when, 1998  or 1996?  It doesn't matter.  The whole album is great and and Dre does a  great job, so buy this!  The best song is The Next Episode but it is to  short.  Buy this if you are not underage!
B00001ODHJ|5.0|This movie is great.  It is a funny action packed horror movie.  To some people it might be funny, to other people it might be scary.  You follow Ash as he goes back in time and is mistaken as &quot;the chosen one from  the heavens.&quot;  Ash is really stubborn and stupid, which makes him  funny.  The funniest part of the movie is when he gets into a fight with  his evil twin.  If you liked this movie check out Evil Dead II, Evil Dead I  isnt very good, but Evil Dead II is.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This cd is one of the best i have ever listend to. It has catchy songs with great lyrics. All of the songs are great. Some of the best  are &quot;lucky&quot; &quot;what u see is what u get&quot; &quot;stronger&quot;  &quot;oops i did it again&quot; &quot;Don't let me be the last to  know&quot; and &quot;one kiss from you, but all the songs are great.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This CD is my weakness...it's one of the few I listen to a lot without getting sick of it.  I bought this CD a few months ago after hearing &quot;Porcelain&quot; on the trailer for THE BEACH.  I almost bought the  soundtrack to the movie, but decided to check out the album to see which  one I'd like better.  After hearing part of &quot;My Weakness&quot; on  Amazon (and beating myself up trying to think where I'd heard it before) I  realized it had been featured on THE X-FILES.  I'm 100% satisfied that I  bought this instead of THE BEACH.  (&quot;The Sky Is Broken&quot; was also  on an episode of X-FILES.)  I can never decide which song is my favorite.   Sometimes I go for the great chorus of &quot;South Side&quot; and other  times I go for the techno sound of &quot;Machete.&quot;  Other times I like  the funkiness of &quot;Run On.&quot;  While those are three of my favorites  on the album, I think the best ones are the two I bought it for,  &quot;Porcelain&quot; and &quot;My Weakness.&quot;  I find it funny that  &quot;Porcelain&quot; is just now receiving popularity on radio, when I  discovered it long ago.  (I had actually heard and liked it before THE  BEACH but never knew what it was until then.)  I'd also heard  &quot;Bodyrock&quot; but I like it a lot better on the CD than I did  hearing it elsewhere.  A good friend of mine criticized my decision to buy  the CD when I told her I wanted it, and now she is completely obsessed with  &quot;Porcelain&quot; and wants to buy the CD.  There is a lot of variety  on this CD, but all of it is distinctly Moby.  I heard the opening song in  GONE IN 60 SECONDS and immediately knew it was him since it sounded similar  to &quot;Run On&quot; and &quot;Honey.&quot;  Anybody who likes any of  Moby's singles is bound to find a few songs they love on this CD.  Also,  those who enjoy variety with a mix of thoughtful, reflective songs and  up-tempo ones should buy this.
B00000BKDW|5.0|For me this is Iron Maiden at their best, with both Adrian Smith &amp; Dave Murray, playing some of the most creative guitar I have ever heard.  Bruce's vocals are on top form, Steve's Bass playing is the foundation to  the whole album, with a very cool Nico Mcbrain holding down a cool and yet  very technically brilliant approach.  This album is fantastic...  Buy it  now!
B00004SCX6|5.0|This record is one of those rare finds that alter the way you veiw the world. It is a profound exploration of life's mysteries wrapped in the veneer of simplicity. It belongs in the pantheon of modern creative  wonders; alongside Captain Beefheart's &quot;Troutmask replica&quot;, Miles  Davis's &quot;Cool&quot;, and the Beatles &quot;White&quot; album. I say to  these other records, &quot;Move over, there's a new sheriff in town and her  name is Britney!&quot;. Britney is a child prodegy along the lines of  Mozart; a once in a Century gift from the heavens. Let us be grateful we  were here when she arrived! I bow to her and now I will listen to her  sublime poetry again and again and again....and so should you!
0553277472|5.0|Despite the book's title, Pirsig's journey is primarily one through the history of Western philosophy, from the pre-Socratics through Plato, Aristotle, the 18th century empricists, and 19th century idealists.  On  this level alone, the book succeeds in being one of the most accessible and  reliable treatments of the field.  But the text is also a critique of the  whole Western &quot;logocentric&quot; tradition, with its emphasis on  reason, or &quot;dialectic.&quot;  Like Kant (&quot;Critique of Pure  Reason&quot;) or Kierkegaard (&quot;Concluding Unscientific  Postscript&quot;), Pirsig uses reason to expose the limitations of reason.  And what does he replace it with?  Not Eastern mysticism or Zen riddles but  rhetoric.  More than the classic rhetoricians that Pirsig exhalts or the  20th-century structuralists and post-structuralists (Barthes, Derrida,  Foucault) for which Pirsig's narrative is practically an illustration,  &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; makes the case for  language as the basis for all reality, for all that we think, experience  and perceive.  It's this conflict between dialectic and rhetoric that  drives the narrative, realized in plain yet compelling prose that's capable  of staying with the attentive reader for the rest of his or her lifetime.  After reading the book twice, I was unable to look at the self, the world,  at all things constructed by language in quite the same way.  The least  successful parts of the book, it seems to me, are the narrator's protracted  discussions of the nature of &quot;reality&quot; as a moment inaccessible  to human intellect and his somewhat naive, 1960's-style musings on the  nature of &quot;quality.&quot;  Supposedly his English composition students  were immediately able to know it when they saw it, thereby making it  unnecessary for him as a teacher to talk about &quot;standards&quot; or to  establish criteria.  (The suspicion arises that Pirsig hasn't had a great  deal of experience teaching students how to write.)  Nevertheless, even  when a cylinder occasionally misfires, this is a book worth reading  carefully and more than once. Unfortunately, because of its  &quot;cult&quot; status, many people seem to purchase the text but never  finish it.  Robert Redford owns the screen rights, but a reader would be  ill-advised to wait for the movie version.  The &quot;visual&quot; elements  of the text--the motorcyle odyssey and troubled father-son  relationship--are minor metaphors compared to the ambitious and largely  successful intellectual quest.e teaching students how to write.)

1573225517|5.0|I saw the movie first and loved it.  It follows the book so closely that the book is almost like a movie script.  But the parts that are not in the movie are equally funny and smart.<br />Rob is a very self-conscious guy.  Following all his thoughts, even the ones he tries not to think about, is  an eye-opening experience for me.  I especially enjoyed his string of  thoughts right before he had sex with Marie.  Is that how a guy thinks?  So  different from us girls.<br />Overall, Rob is a very believable character.  Even if you have seen the movie, this book is still a fun read.  That's all  I have to say about this book.
B00004STPT|5.0|I have been collecting soundtracks for more years than most of you have been on the planet. I have the original LP of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956)that I bought when I was 15 back in 1960.I'm a  fullblood &quot;movie buff&quot; who tried my hand at screenwriting and  actually got a script to Dudley Moore, but that's another story.<br />I just  got back from seeing &quot;Gladiator&quot; for the 5th time. I can't  remember when I last loved a movie so much I couldn't wait for the  video.Russell Crowe plays the perfect man: intensely and powerfully  masculine, but humble and modest. I have the CD of this score, but  listening to this score on the theatre surround-sound system is the only  way to do it! The music vibrates to your bone marrow and puts you right  into the action !<br />Yes, it's a loud score, but this is a supremely  masculine movie (not macho! There's a difference!) I'd have paid anything  to watch the musicians playing this score. You know Mr. Zimmer had them  working so hard, they were in a sweat! Also the layers of the music  instrument arrangement make this score one you hear more of each time you  listen to it.<br />As much as I adore John Williams (got all his stuff- and  you can meet him if you wait outside the backstage door of the Hollywood  Bowl when ever he's in concert), his action music boils down to pretty much  noise. Cuts 3 and 13 of &quot;Gladiator&quot; (the opening superb battle  scene, and the arena fight)are not only extremely cohesive, but beautiful  and exhilerating to listen to. These two cuts REALLY get your blood  going.<br />I will see the movie a few more times for the theatre sound  experience and try to sit still and not &quot;conduct the orchestra.!&quot;   And please, no more comparisons with &quot;Braveheart&quot;. This is a  different story! Wouldn't it be BORING if all movies were the same?
B00000F1D3|5.0|I have always loved Cher.  I think she is truly an underrated singer.  She has a very powerful voice capable of a lot of emotion.  I like women with powerful voices.  And I like her &quot;down to earth&quot;  attitude.<br />&quot;Believe&quot; is an incredible song.  No wonder it was  the number one song in the world last year.  I also really love &quot;Dov'e  L'amore&quot;.  I don't understand why it wasn't released as a single.   Cher sings it with conviction.  &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;The  Power&quot; are also terrific dance tracks. All of the tracks are good and  the album is thoroughly enjoyable to listen to.
6300182266|3.0|As stated elsewhere, this is not eps 1 and 5 re-edited into a two hour plus movie but a cut-down version of the three hour pilot produced for ABC.  Universal, hoping to recoup the cost of this expensive project, created this cut-down version for theatrical release in Canada which gave Canadians a look at Battlestar Galactica weeks before it debuted in the U.S on ABC.  Universal, never missing a trick, decided to give the Canadian cut-down version a U.S theatrical release after ABC cancelled the series.  Surprisingly, audiences shelled out their hard earned cash to see this shorter, slightly altered version of the movie they were able to experience on TV for free less than 10 months earlier.    Universal, realizing that they were on to something, tossed together a few more eps for theatrical release overseas.  The result?  \\"MISSION GALACTICA:  THE CYLON ATTACK\\" and \\"CONQUEST OF THE EARTH\\".  Both made money and both had repsectable sales in the U.S when released on VHS.      It should be noted that while this film is presented in an aspect ratio of 1.85 this was achieved by matting the image to create a widescreen version.  As a result you're actually seeing less of the original image, not more.  Also, this DVD is not enhanced for widescreen televisions so be prepared to hit the zoom function on your widescreen set to fill the screen.
B00004T0P1|1.0|Granted, it's not as bad as Disney's Hercules' soundtrack... But it is one of the most boring soundtracks I've heard. I don't think my voice makes any difference here, seeing as all the reviewers here gave it 5 stars, so I'm  not telling you if you should or shouldn't buy it... It's your choice. I  was very much disappointed with this soundtrack. Just to clarify, I didn't  watch the film (yet)... But this thing sounds like a bad mix between the  soundtracks of Lion King (which was very good) and Tarzan (which was a bad  score, but not as bad as this). No originality or thought here-- The  opening theme (that &quot;lullaby&quot; thing) is ridiculously predictable.  &quot;The Egg Travels&quot; is a cheap &quot;upbeat&quot; score that tricks  you to think &quot;Oh, cool&quot; instead of actually listening to it, when  you notice that it's been done a thousend times before. Actually, Tarzan's  score and this are almost identical-- all those  &quot;Jungle-Drums-with-Tremolo-Strings&quot; in chase scenes is getting  very old. The only nice track here is &quot;The Courtship&quot; but again,  it's downhill from there. I nearly fell asleep-- It was all horribly  boring. No structure or thought whatsoever. They even used the same  instruments as in Tarzan. Yawn.<br />Want a good score? Get Jerry Goldsmith's  Mulan. Want an even better score? Get John Williams' Schindler's List.
6304077955|5.0|....but it is not something I want to rush out and buy.<br />This long, abrasive, hard-hitting film about Johnny who, considering he's a violent rapist, is on the run and hates the world we live in.  He goes to London in  search of his ex-girlfriend played very well by Lesley Sharp (why, oh why,  does she not receive the true recognition she deserves as an actress! ) and  on discovering she's not home seduces and then abuses her unemployed,  alcoholic flatmate Sophie who falls in love with him.  Then he goes on a  tour of London meeting lots of unhappy people and basically  offending them  in one way or other while he incorporates his views on God, life and  stuff.<br />And there is also a mysterious and evil yuppie hanging around who  goes round beating up and raping women before finally going to see Sophie's  nueroic and supposedly squeaky-clean other flatmate who come back from a  disastrous holiday at the last minute.<br />Angry, cynical and raw there is  not one flawed performance in this film and while it took quite a bit of  effort to get my head round it it was well worth it.<br />Not for the kids.
B00000612G|5.0|I bought Richie's new album along with Bon Jovi's newest album 'Crush' and Jon Bon Jovi's 'Destination Anywhere'. The last two have been shoved into the 'oh well' pile and Richie's has ended up in the REPLAY over-and-over  pile. Makes me wonder how Jon (although I love much of the Bon Jovi music  and Jon's 'Blaze of Glory') has ended up as Bon Jovi's lead singer when  Richie Sambora outshines him in that regard. Marvelous vocals....as much  punch as another fav of mine...Eddie Vedder! WOW!
B00000DLVA|4.0|Who could forget the Cardigans' hit &quot;Lovefool&quot;? They were so happy and full of pop music joy..no more. Their 1998 album Gran Turismo is obviously a result of alot of searching through the music industry's trip  hop scene. It works, especially with Nina Gordon's soul searching voice.  The album is full of low key ambience, opening with &quot;Paralyzed&quot;,  a beautiful, murky nine inch nails-like track. Of course, &quot;My favorite  Game&quot; is the standout, with a beat that will stick in your head for  awhile and is catchy as &quot;Lovefool&quot;,minus the upbeat tone.  &quot;Erase/Rewind&quot; is also a great track, with its distant sound and  synth bleeps. There are a few dragging moments and tends to get repetitive  with the oh-woes-me words. Jeez, Trent Reznor doesnt moan and groan this  much. Still, it has more good than bad, and if youre a fan of garbage or  Tricky, youll probably like this one.
B00004TL21|5.0|It will be hard for me to give this a proper review at this moment, but I did want to say that I can understand the critic saying it is a more mellow Deftones, sure, but thats not to say it isn't heavy.  &quot;Change&quot; is  excellent, I had heard it on the radio, so I already loved that song.  They  do a song with Maynard Keenan from TOOL called &quot;Passenger&quot;, and  that is very interesting.  I need to listen to it alot more, but so far I  am loving it, and it is not that mellow, still very Deftones.  I love them,  they are one of my top 3 favorite bands.  They have not sold out, so dont  think that.
B00004TL21|4.0|The third deftones release, the white pony, is slight departure from the bands two earlier works, adrenaline and around the fur, this album still packs alot of punch, but also veers off into more moderate tempoed, dark,  moody pieces. I have to say that the first listen of this disk is a bit  unsettling not what you are used to from the deftones but you wil  unwillingly find yourself being drawn back to it and loving it more and  more each time. That too me has always been the sign of a good album. The  songs just start getting under your skin and then you know your in love.  This may very well be on its way to becoming my favorite deftones record,  and i didnt think i could like anything better than around the fur...buy  it!  the deftones rule!  Its good to see a band making hard rocking music  with dynamics and substance that so many of their peers seem to miss, you  know who im talking about (limp bizkit). Thses guys are ready to blow up!   Why only 4 stars, dont know and within a week ill most likely kick yself  and wish i had given it 5, but maybe this ones got to age a little and  breath like good wine...Standout tracks are change, digital bath, teenager,  passenger, and pink maggit. Great cd!
B00004TL21|5.0|The third and best album of this great band. White Pony have a perfect balance between strong rhythms and melodic vocals, in the best style of Chino's singing. The album takes you from the most powerful and intense  songs like &quot;Elite&quot; to the most pure expressions of calmness like  &quot;Digital Bath&quot; or &quot;Teenager&quot;. Deftones has done a great  work as they are used to. If you get this album you won't be disappointed.  It was worth waiting 3 years for it.
0880381736|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight is the first Fantasy book I have ever read. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman are the best when it comes to writing fantasy I believe they have no equal( this is only my opinion) the world of  Krynn is interesting and all the characters are interesting Raistlin is my  favorite, he is so bad and evil when he wants to be. He does have a softer  side to him but he doesn't allways show it. So if you are looking for  something good to read you can't go wrong with Dragons of Autumn Twilight  buy it and read it you'll be glad you did.

B00000JPHD|5.0|Dracula is one of Hollywood's Classic Horror Movies and one of the best movies to come out during the 1930's. Bela Lugosi playing Dracula gives one of (I feel) best performances, but like has been told he was forever type  cast as Dracula and his career was not the same. I'm not an actor But I  personaly would be proud of a role like Dracula. I highly recommened this  movie.
0805062971|3.0|See the movie before you read the book. I saw the movie three times before I began hunting for the book. It disappeared from the shelves once the DVD came out. Surprises and plot twists blow you away in the movie, but leave  you saying, &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; in the book.<br />Chuck Palahniuk had a  brilliant idea, and his novel is written in a string of similies and  metaphors, vivid descriptions coming from an unidentified Everyman as he  tries to find meaning in a soulless existence he hates. The book is  organized in a stream of consciousness, leading into events, then  backtracking to see how those events transpired. <br />Tyler Durden is one of  the most enigmatic and fascinating characters created since Alex in Anthony  Burgess' Clockwork Orange. Durden takes the Adbusters magazine view of  life, refuting consumerism, with a Christian slant, as he encourages  physical pain and self-abasement in the pursuit of spiritual purity.  &quot;It's only when you lose everything that you're free to do  anything,&quot; he says. He's what every guy wants to be--fearless, tough,  forthright and masculine, with a raw power that attracts followers, and  gains Marla's worship.<br />The movie screenplay condensed characters, put key  events in a better context, and captured enough of the narration to convey  meaning, while not clouding the story. This book received three stars  because it fizzles out. Tyler's character stops growing about three  quarters through the book, and Palahniuk seems to start fearing what he  created in Tyler. The movie's superb ending is a definite improvement. I'm  considering getting a DVD player so I can watch the Fight Club DVD, which  has outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage from the film, which should  become a cult classic among working- and middle-class men who continue to  ask themselves in a modern society what it means to be a man.

To wealthy aristocrats: Marquise De Merteuil and the promiscuous Vicomte De Valmont plot a war of  sexual seduction.  Merteuil had been cased of for a young convent girl:  Cecile De Volanges. Merteuil ask her former lover Valmont to seduce Cecile  so on the wedding night her former lover will see her revenge.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|While I think it is hard for most fans to determine a favorite Maiden album, I believe this will rate up as one of those albums. More progressive sounding (and definitely better) than &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;  and &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, they have gone to longer songs and epic  themes most comparable to &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; and &quot;7th  Son&quot;, minus the synth guitars. Bruce is back stronger than ever,  letting his voice soar like the good ol' days and not as coarse such as on  &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;.<br />Songs &quot;The Wicker  Man&quot;,&quot;Brave New World&quot;, and &quot;Out of the Silent  Planet&quot; will immediately stand out. Bruce soars on &quot;Ghost of the  Navigator&quot; and &quot;Blood Brother&quot;. Nine minute epics  &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; and &quot;The Nomad&quot; are both great.  <br />There isn't much to be dissatified with on this album. Even great albums  like &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; and &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; had less  enjoyable songs (think &quot;Gangland&quot; and &quot;Quest for  Fire&quot;). All Old Timer's that still dig this kind of music especially  need to check this one out!<br />Be seeing you on tour. Up the Iron's!
B00001NFCY|3.0|This album is very hard rocking as has a lot of hard edges to it and a great sound overall, but so what?  I mean it's not that original, despite it's overplay &quot;Higher&quot; is still the best track on the CD and  that's a pretty good song but the rest of the album just is your standard  hard rock type of sound some of the lyrics and message are definitely  different than many other bands out there since it has a definite religious  influence but overall I'm just not that impressed.  It starts to sound  repetitive by the end of the album and there's really nothing to bring you  back.
B00000IJPU|3.0|If you're a long-time fan of Maiden then you don't need me to tell you that the track listing of this album is totally inadequate. This is for listeners unfamiliar with the Maiden experience. If you like what you hear  on this, then you MUST get the full studio albums. This is only the tip of  the iceberg; there is so much more great stuff of theirs. Start with the  80's stuff first. <br />For those who want a best of compilation, there is a  2-cd version of &quot;Best of the Beast&quot; that is a lot better but is  still missing a few key songs. The 2-cd set seems to have recently gone out  of print in America (as of May,2000) but you may still be able to get it at  Amazon.co.uk. Also, look at &quot;Ed Hunter&quot;, it costs a bit more  because of the game, but it may be perfect for you. Otherwise, you should  put together your own compilation.
B00000IOSU|4.0|For me at least this CD contains many of Sarah's greatest hits and that combined with the fact that it is a live performance seems to make for a pretty decent album.  With hard to find songs like &quot;I Will Remember  You&quot; and such great hits as &quot;Fumbling&quot; and &quot;Building A  Mystery&quot; this album is a good introduction to Sarah's work in general.  And if you have all of her other albums these live renditions will be a  nice addition.
B00004T9UF|3.0|Once apon a time (not so very long ago at all) you heard a song on the radio, found out it was a #1 ranking song, and could go to the store (or Amazon!) and buy it on an incredibly overpriced single.  But that was fine,  because you had your song you liked, and didn't have 16 some others you  couldn't stand, like you'd end up with if only a full album were available.   Well, song singles are becoming extinct and now we are all, more often  than not, faced with the perplexing question 'to buy the entire album or  not?'  In Eminem's case with this album, it's a shame I must say it, but  I'll have to pass.  I adore 'The Real Slim Shady.'  I think is shows pure  ingenuity and talent.  And I don't mind  the profanity or the people  bashing, but there is one song on this album, one I have not seen one  complimentary comment made by any reviewer (thankfully) that makes it  impossible for me to even consider buying it for myself - 'Kim'.
B000003AEB|5.0|If you do not include greatest hits albums, this is easily the second best rap album of all time, second only of course to the immortal Chronic.  This album is simply alive with great sounds, and great flows.  There is no  reason to skip any of the songs on this CD.  Of course near the top is the  famous &quot;Gin And Juice&quot; which could be one of the best songs of  all time, it just has great lyrics and a great beat.  Then there's  &quot;Murder Was The Case&quot; that not only has an interesting story  attached to it but is also a great sound all around.  &quot;Serial  Killa&quot; is of course one of the catchiest rap sounds of all time, I  still can't get it out of my head.  &quot;Who Am I?&quot; and &quot;Gz and  Hustlas&quot; are also great songs, and the rendition of &quot;Lodi  Dodi&quot; could be one of the best renditions ever recorded.  This album  is a must have for any serious rap fan.
B00004TL21|4.0|The Deftones have done a good job with White Pony, their third album release.  But, unfortunately, like so many other artists, they're starting to loose touch with what was expected.  Songs on this album do rock  hardcore, but there is just something missing that most deftones fans will  notice.  So, although it's not quite what I wanted it to be, White Pony  still has the rock appeal and will leave your ears ringing.
B00004TL21|5.0|All I have to say is that the Deftones are simply one of the best bands out there. This CD is a demonstration of it. The thing that most surprised me was the different direction the band takes on this new record!. Though  it still has some very heavy songs like &quot;elite&quot;, it also has more  slower but beautiful songs...specially the one with Tool's singer Maynard  James Keenan &quot;passenger&quot; that really resembles a Tool song. If  you're looking for a record like &quot;Around the Fur&quot; then maybe you  will be dissapointed because it's not as Heavy and Chino doesn't scream as  much (except in &quot;elite&quot; in wich he screams during the WHOLE song)  as in their first two records. But if you're a Deftones fan like I am and  like bands like Tool and A Perfect Circle then I guarantee you'll love it   or at least like it. It's still worth listening and a change from all the  crap out this days (Kid Rock). A full five stars! .
0679735259|5.0|Dispatches is the book about Vietnam from the perspective of the &quot;grunt&quot;. It should be required reading at every war college and for that matter every high school in this country. As Wilfred Owen said  about the War to End All Wars: &quot;My friend, you would not tell with  such high zest To children ardent for some desperate glory, The old Lie:  Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori.&quot; Have your sons read this so we  never have our boys come home in body bags again.
0553108034|3.0|The first thing I did after finishing the &quot;Game of thorns&quot; was to order by fastest mail the &quot;clash of kings&quot;.It came with hard cover-a beutiful new book-the seqeule to my favorite-what excitment! .Now  here I must say that a book is something to savor with all sensess:first  look-the cover,the drawing,then the touch smell and yes even the sound of  pages can make music.And this book was a dilaght to all sensess.But then  one must read as well.And so I read.It was but a shadow of its  predesessor.It held only half of the suspense and had little from the  previos drama.There were to many carrecters names to remember and too  little plot and action.I maight excuse it by thinking that maby I was so  excited and expectent that I read too fast-and some books requier slower  reading pace.But for that reson I tried to read slowly one chapter again  and to no sucsess.So to sum it all up I'd say that I will surely want to  read the next one and that the writer can still fix the dammege done  because the first was so good-but every body looses patiance at the end,and  if he wants to continue with his previos sucsess he must do much beter.Good  luck for I love a good book and his sucsses is my plesure.
B000001F9E|5.0|I have just recently gotten into Thin Lizzy. A good friend of mine got me into them by playing this album, &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, cover to cover. I was in awe by this band! &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; and  &quot;Cowboy Song&quot; I had heard before - that was the end of my Thin  Lizzy knowledge. But this album is classic all the way through! It has  soulful grooves like &quot;Romeo and the Lonely Girl&quot; and &quot;Fight  or Fall&quot;, as well as some heavy rockers like &quot;Emerald&quot;,  &quot;Warriors&quot; and the title track, &quot;Jailbreak&quot;. And the  band never loses this &quot;feel&quot; that they have. The music is always  tight and right in the pocket. This is the Thin Lizzy album to begin with.  If you're like me, you'll want more after hearing this one. Break out!
6305003882|5.0|this movie is simply exelent! it's intresting for adolecents to see... so i think that parents should give their children the chance to see this movie. it does get violent at times but it all ends up with the viewers  swearing they'll never do drugs. it's not just a movie to entairtain, it's  a movie to EDUCATE in the world our children are going to live in!...
B0000020C4|5.0|For me this is the definitive CD for Les Miserables.  I read every review and bought this one.  I enjoy every minute of it.  I let one of my friends borrow it (has the London org) he loved it and did not want to give it  back.  My favorite is the Epilogue (Finale).  It is great with the Royal  Philharmonic and the chorus of a thousand.  You will not regret this  purchase, the performances draw you in.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I first heard about Dido listening to the Eminem CD, song n# 3 STAN. I bought her CD right away knowing that it would be great. Well, such songs as Here with me, Don't think of me or Thankyou make her a star rigth away.  Where did she get that voice ? It reminds me of Portishead and Louise Wener  the ex-Sleeper female singer. It's definitely a great CD and it's worth  buying it.  Long live Dido !
B000002KET|5.0|Like most of you, I used to think that 'Paranoid' and 'Master of Reality' were the best Sabbath albums, hands down. But after hundreds of listens, the harsh, gloomy riffs don't fill me with the same sense of energy and  emotion. Of course, you can like 'Paranoid' or 'Master of Reality' if you  choose and I won't say you are wrong. But I find the aged Sabbath riffs  even more enjoyable.<br />THIS IS HOW I SEE THE CLASSIC FIRST SIX  ALBUMS:<br />Black Sabbath - Harsh, gloomy, and scary. A superb album.  *****<br />Paranoid - Powerful and full of energy. Has the three best  individual songs (War Pigs, Iron Man, and Paranoid), but still isn't the  best album. *****<br />Master of Reality - Follows the same gloomy pattern of  'Paranoid,' but doesn't sound calculated for even a second. Great.  *****<br />Volume 4 - The only album I feel deserves less than five stars. It  has many great songs, but just hasn't grown on me yet. ****1/2<br />Sabbath  Bloody Sabbath - When Sabbath reached their peak. Every riff is beautiful  (in a heavy metal sort of way). In my opinion, 'Spiral Architect' is one of  the best songs Black Sabbath ever did. The best album in their catalogue.  *****<br />Sabotage - Just as good as the preceding album without following  the same pattern. Sequenced wonderfully and exploding with energy, this is  the last great Black Sabbath record. *****<br />Keep in mind that I'm not  reviewing this to TELL you what to think. I am just expressing my opinion  and hoping someone will find this useful.
B00000J2KT|4.0|Stanley Kubrick should be applauded for -- in what is perhaps the first instance of a Hollywood movie -- accurately portraying the American conscience in Vietnam.  <br />Forget the paper-thin morality and hidden  propaganda of ``Platoon,&quot; and the chest-thumping testosterone of such  laughingly bad portrayals as ``The Green Berets&quot;;  Mr. Kubrick shows  us the real Vietnam:  from the dehumanization of boot camp to the sporadic  deaths of comrades in battle.<br />Essentially, this is two films in one. The  first half dealing with new recruits adjusting to military life; the second  with actual combat.   Many will tell you the latter doesn't live up to the  former, do not believe them.   Mr. Kubrick delivers an incredibly accurate  depiction of Vietnam warfare.<br />Unfortunately,  I had to take a star off  this otherwise perfect movie because the DVD transfer is quite bad.
B000002HRE|4.0|I love it. Just as good as Load. But the first time I listened to in, guess what. I hated it. But when I listened to it about half an hour later, it sounded diffrent. I got used to the style. The first time you listen to  it, sounds off and uncoordinated. Then the second time it sound PERFECT.  Now I love it. Its great! just hard to....... its like a pair of snug  pants, but once they get washed a couple times they are just right for you  (ass). Buy it. Very good. You know what I mean.
B000000P17|3.0|everybody keeps saying this is the worst GNR album,but I don't thinksaw.Its true that after the leaving of Izzy Stradlin of GNR the band wasnt the same anymore,but Gilby Clarke its a good musician too.The tracks  in this album are very good,but they dont have the personality or charisma  that the clasic GNR songs have.
1573226521|5.0|This book was a huge surprise for me. In fact the trailer for the upcoming (and horrible) movie rendition is what prompted me to purchase it. I was overwhelmingly surprised; it's a wonderful book. Alex is witty and  entertaining, the story pans out very nicely, there are many surprises and  it's overall beautifully written. Aside from the obvious similarities with  &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; I am not sure I should compare the two  novels, this one is fundamentally different in focus. Really, what gripped  me the most about the novel is the little anecdotes and brilliant  narratives from the protagonist. Clearly I could identify with the  character enough to make it impossible for me to put this book down. In  conclusion, read this book! And leave Leonardo's new movie for the  uninformed masses. Consider yourself warned. This book is a must read for  (I hate this moniker) GenX'ers with the travel bug!
B00004TL21|3.0|to all those who like fred durst, and that type of music need to buy this cd. although it is not as good as deftones earlier album &quot;around the fur&quot;. the cd is although definately i think all rock fans should buy.
B000006P8I|2.0|As a modest Bowie fan I already owned a best of collection and &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; when I heard &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot; on the radio. It was the twisted sentimentality and sinister narrative of this song that attracted me to this first Bowie album. &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot; is, without doubt, the stand out track here. The album as a whole does not seem to have worn well with the years, sounding like a novelty recording - dated and quaint.
B00004SCX6|1.0|The instant success &quot;Baby one more time&quot; turned Britney Spears into an international phenomenon. However, her much anticipated sophmore album is a huge shortcoming. The title track cannot be compared to the  first hit and the rest of the album is just another remake of her first.  For example, the song &quot;Stronger&quot; has the repeating line of  &quot;My lonleiness is killing me no more&quot;. What is up with that? Once  again her voice has been enhanced with machines yet she will never be able  to reach the heights of stars like Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, and  Celine Dion, or even her fellow teen peers like Christina Aguilera and  Jessica Simpson and never reach the height of success with any of her  ballads like &quot;Dear Diary&quot;. Britney Spears has 5 years tops.
B00000G5VI|4.0|The other reviewers here really have it right. This album, incredibly not released in the US, has been delighting UK fans for many years.<br />Written and recorded in just ten days (according to reports I've read), and mixed  in just a few more, Bowie sounds like he's having fun for a change - and  the music is the fresher for it. Almost all the instruments are played by  Bowie himself and by Erdal Kizilcay, his Turkish multi-instrumentalist  sidekick. (Lenny Kravitz obliges with a guitar contribution on the title  track). The songs are obviously the results of spontaneous jam sessions.  Many tracks are instrumental; only a couple are recognisable as traditional  songs - notably Buddha and Strangers When we Meet (later reworked on  Outside).<br />Fans will love the many references to the old hits. Best of all  is the repeat of the five-chord Space Oddity riff, closely followed by Mike  Garson's piano playing.<br />To set the record straight for US afficionados:  the album is ostensibly the soundtrack to the eponymous BBC TV series,  itself an adaptation of the acclaimed novel about London life in the 1970s  by author Haneif Kureishi (all available on Amazon). In fact the series  uses Bowie's work of the period (Rebel Rebel etc) as incidental music; this  album is &quot;inspired&quot; by the movie.<br />The music is intriguing for  Bowie scholars, giving a hint of what might have been had he carried on the  Eno trajectory - which ironically he did try to do on Outside.<br />In any  case, a strong buy. I just save my five stars for Heroes and Hunky Dory...
B00000J7J4|4.0|I am going to keep this short. This album in one word is great. Leading with the hit track &quot;Smooth&quot;, this album is a must to add to your collection. With hit artists helping such as Rob Thomas, Everlast, and  Lauryn Hill, it is classic.
6304595247|4.0|Every once in a while, I encounter an actor who, although playing a familiar character, seems to re-invent it and show details of it that have never before been displayed.  Such is Ralph Fiennes portrayal of Heathcliff  in this film.  I was not at all surprised that Spielberg chose him for  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; after watching this film--Fiennes' Heathcliff  is almost wholly unsympathetic (he is a wife---and child-- abuser) but  Fiennes lets us know the inner heartbreak that drives Heathcliff to such  meanness.  Previous Heathcliffs have been more stock romantic leads--the  original Moody Guys a' la' James Dean.<br />I can't really understand the  extreme negativity of the &quot;official&quot; reviews--it appears that the  movie, as is the novel, its characters, the author, and her entire family  is a little off-center and out of the mainstream.  The Brontes were a bunch  of weird and wild kids in a weird and wild part of the world, and  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a weird and wild book--not a proper  Victorian romance, as other reviewers have suggested.  Comparing Emily  Bronte to Jane Austen is like comparing William Faulkner to John Grisham  because they are both from Mississippi. None of Austen's characters could  survive in Bronte's Yorkshire, and the Brontes would probably be unwelcome  in Austen's stately Hampshire homes.<br />I,too, liked this book as a  teenager, and now have the opportunity to teach it to high schoolers,and I  must say my students generally  prefer this novel and this film treatment  to most others in British Literature.  The film does have its flaws--but  not enough to make it unwatchable, and having spent a wild, rainy weekend  in the Bronte's hometown of Haworth, Yorkshire, I do believe the film aptly  captures the mood of that forbidding place.<br />As for the choice of Sinead  O'Connor to play Emily &quot;framing&quot; the &quot;frame story&quot;--  all I can guess is that she does bear a passing resemblance to the portrait  of Charlotte Bronte that hangs over my computer (great, big, intense eyes).  Plus the Brontes were ethnically Irish.<br />Watch this film to help your  English lit grade, to observe a truly artful nuanced acting performance, to  enjoy some beautiful scenery, or just enjoy a weepy gothic romance.

B00002Z88D|5.0|Before hearing S&amp;M, I didn't particularly care for Metallica.  The combination of Rock and Symphony is a work of art in itself.  Having heard most of the songs in both their original and S&amp;M formats, I must say  that this album is a close to perfect as most bands will ever get.  If I  were to suggest one album to anyone, this would be it.  The harmony of  Symphony and Metallica is beautiful.  I suggest that you listen to &quot;Of  Wolf And Man&quot;, &quot;Hero Of The Day&quot; and &quot;Fuel&quot; to get  a real feel for this album.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is a very beautiful record.  [Since the time of] ... itsinitial release it still manages to impress with its unique and modern sound  combined with a structure and melody of a standard pop/rock song. And  having sold 15 million copies worldwide (including 4 million domestically)  it definitely proved commercially successful and for the first time in  Madonna's career got much deserved attention based on the music solely  rather than Madonna's colorful public image. Madonna and William Orbit (the  producer) deserve much credit!
B00003CWL5|1.0|I wasn't bothered by the Pedophelia, as a matter of fact, the only thing that bothered me was the script.  The acting is great, the direction is great, it has two or three descent scenes, but none of the will ever be  able to save this movie from the horror of itself.  If this movie had never  been made, I would be just as well off.
B00004TL21|5.0|Some bands sell-out (ala KoRn), some bands just change style (ala Machinehead) and some bands never change (ala Rage Against The Machine).  But the best bands EVOLVE. The best bands being Nine Inch Nails, Tool and  Deftones.  Adrenaline was cool, love it, but it was only a hint of what  they were capable of. Around The Fur was a breakthrough, seeing them  developing their own unique style and sound. They were 'carving their  niche' :)  But White Pony takes it two steps further. The album has a very  new, and more layered sound, much more full, alot more is happening.  Lyrically its obtuse and vague as ever, but coupled with chinos voice  (which has never sounded better) they create a fantastic mood and  atmosphere. And Chino does sound terrific - from the most hardcore  screaming he has ever done like on ELITE, to the goosebump inducing wailing  on KNIFE PARTY to his sweet soft melody on DIGITAL BATH and PASSENGER which  also features the awesome Maynard James Keenan (he of Tool, A Perfect  Circle fame).   The tracks are like this -   Feiticera - Cool, middle of  the line stuff.   Digital Bath - Very atmospheric.   Elite - Full-on  heavy-as aural assault. Kicks.   RX Queen - Again, alot of atmosphere.    Street Carp - Very cool, verging on the heavier side of things.   Teenager  - Very unique, soft, alot of strange sounds.   Kinfe Party - Stirring,  emotional, bassy, cool.   Korea - AWESOME. My fave. Very heavy, awesome  singing.   Passenger - Two best rock singers alove today together. Very  cool, more atmospere.   Change - Interestin first single, good song.   Pink  Maggit - Starts off weird, gets cool at the end.   Bonus track - Reminds of  Damone, the secret track from Around The Fur.<br />  Overall - doesn't have  the anthems like My Own Summer and Be Quiet and Drive but should be  immensely popular with fans. They have definately become amazing artists  and if they continue to improve at this rate then watch out rock world.
6304711905|5.0|You can't beat it.  Hands down the best movie about the shoot out at the OK Corral.  Val Kilmer plays one of his greatest roles as Doc Hollywood.  Kurt Russell plays a much better Wyatt Earp than Kevin Costner ever did.   If you've never seen it, buy it.  If you have seen it, buy it.  I have seen  this movie fifty times, and will watch it a hundred more.  I highly  recommend it, especially on DVD.
B0000027F8|5.0|Songwriter and singer George Michael released this wonderful album in 1990. It was just a little while after he became the artist with the MOST N0. 1 hit in the 1980s (a spot he shared with Madonna). Shadoe Stevens of  American Top 40 noted that George and Madonna both had 9 number one hits in  the 80s. Maturing from his Wham bubblegum pop, to his Faith album, and this  album proved to be his most mature at this point of time. In 1990, George  was eager to shed his &quot;sexiest man in the world&quot; &lt;according to  Roling Stones mag&gt; image and was hiding from the press as much as  possible. He's stop having any interviews (none/nil) which made him even  more mysterious to the public. His sexy image from Faith and Wham days had  taken a blow on him emotionally. He decided he wanted to concentrate purely  on his songwriting and it paid off. This superb album was the outcome.  Although it didn't sell very well compared to Faith, it's only because he  didn't want any publicity (no picture of george on the cover of this  album)- which made Sony very mad, since Sony knew the potential of this  album, if only they could market it in a big way! The song Freedom 90 was  about him shedding off the past image. This song gave George a nomination  in the Grammies for &quot;Best Male Vocalist&quot;. It's the most mature  pop song with great vocals, great instruments, great feel, sexy, powerful,  simply George at his best. First single &quot;Praying For Time&quot; went  straight to number 1 in the US. The rest of the album portrays different  styles and feel from the jazzy &quot;Cowboy and Angels&quot; (George subtly  hinting about his sexuality?), the Beatlesque &quot;Heal The Pain&quot;,and  the soulful &quot;Soul Free&quot;. This album is a showcase of his  songwriting talent, and you will notice how wide his talent is  -jazz/pop/soul/R&amp;B/folk/ etc. To many fans, this is still his best  album of all, and non-fans giving it a try will find it's true.  &quot;Listen Without Prejudice&quot;.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Consisting of a handful of great actors, an incredible audio experience (thanks to the Dust Brothers) and visual effects which, in my opinion, rival The Matrix, Fight Club has captured the very essence of a non-normal  person in a non-normal world. Edward Norton brings to his character a depth  that, I don't think has been matched in a long time. Brad Pitt's character  portrays the ideal alter-ego of Norton's, and their on-scene chemistry is  immense. This movie's complexities will keep you from realizing the truth  until the very end. The title may lend itself to a false impression of the  movie's content, however. Granted there is fighting in the movie, but the  theme carried out is not based on aggressiveness or brutality, instead on  true self-realization in today's world. As the story unravels, you will  find yourself questioning an elusive reality built around a self-created  destruction plot. You gotta see it...
B00000IQMT|5.0|John Williams has done it again! This track is amazing! It picks up all the emotions of the characters, the situations, and the places, and sings them out in beautiful music!The London Symphony Orchestra is awesome! The  Star Wars Main Title lives on!
B00004TL21|5.0|The new album released by deftones, White Pony, is like the rest of the albums that they got out past few years.( adrenaline, around the fur) The new album has more slower beat than the other two past albums. But it has  cool songs like nightrider and white pony. So buy it and you'll love it if  you like heavy metal music. It's definetly better than Korn or Limp Bizkit.
B00004TL21|5.0|i recently bought a copy of this cd, and i loved it. it has hard edgy riffs, as well as beautiful melodies. some of the best songes, are the first single &quot;change&quot;, &quot;pink maggot&quot;, and  &quot;passenger&quot;, which features the lead singer of tool and a perfect  circle, maynard james keenan. i recomend this cd to any Deftones fan.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|'Brave New World' is the long-anticipated reunion album featuring the return of Maiden powerhouse's Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith. Due to the high emotion surrounding the Maiden's return to their golden-era lineup,  this album faced almost impossibly high expectations of the sort that are  rarely if ever fully met... But amidst all of this hype, Iron Maiden has  exceeded all expectations and produced an album that is the equal of any  album  since their golden era of the 80's!  At first glance, 'Brave New  World' is a progressive album which fits most closely into the same  category as 'Somewhere In time' and 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son'.  Although the guitar and bass synths have been jettisoned in favour of a  real keyboard (played by Steve Harris), the overall style and mix of the  synthesizer are similar. The guitar sound has returned to that of the late  80's and Bruce's vocals are once again in top form. Yet upon further  inspection, 'Brave New World' seems to be a combination of many different  elements drawn from each of the albums since the late 80's - the occult  themes of 'Seventh Son', the social awareness and politics of 'No Prayer  For The Dying' and 'Fear Of The Dark', the personal introspection of 'The X  Factor', and the emotional depth of 'Virtual XI'. This album blazes very  little new ground, but instead reiterates the brilliant genius which has  carried Iron Maiden throughout their career. All of the best elements from  the previous 15 years are combined into one amazing album which is sure to  please both old and new fans alike, as well as put to shame certain other  formerly heavy metal bands who have abandoned the true path. 'Brave New  World' has all of the elements of an instant Iron Maiden classic, including  the deep intelligent lyrics, nonstandard song structures, masterful  musicianship. If I could change anything about 'Brave New World', I would  have written more and longer guitar solos and more interplay between the  three guitars. Yet these are only minor points in the face of this  excellent album which has lived up to and surpassed all of my (and all)  expectations.
B000002HAF|5.0|There isn't a song, word or note on this recording that isn't absolutely essential. A breakthrough band at the top of their game. I bought this CD in '89 and, to be honest, it has been a few months since I've listened to  it. I put it on this morning while I was getting ready for work and it  pumped me up and made my whole day better. Buy this CD! Buy two thousand  copies of this CD! It will make you smart! Make you sexy! It will take over  your life so that you can spend the day cruising for chicks (or guys, I  guess)! Sell the farm and the kids and buy lots of copies.<br />Disclaimer: I  do not work for the record company or its distributers and I emphatically  deny being Black Francis.
0679805273|5.0|Every year at the school where I work teachers send off their students who are headed off to middle school with Oh the Places You'll Go,  and frequently there isn't a dry eye in the house.  It is a wonderful,  emotional send-off to anyone embarking on something new.
630587493X|5.0|I cannot believe I just gave a Disney movie 5 stars (!)  Sure, there are some good ones, but I usually don't waste my time to see them!  Anyway this film is awesome.  A fairly wealthy family buy a household robot to clean,  serve, etc.  But, it is not your ordinary machine.  It has feeling  and...almost seems human.  During the film, you watch as his masters grow  old and he lives on; on a quest to find out why he is so different.  The  only thing I find negative about this wonderful family film is the fact  that it is so depressing!  You watch as this robot lives on and his dearest  friends and sort-of-family die.  It has a mixed ending, which is both sad  and happy depending on the way you look at it.  But, beyond all my  complaining this is still one of the best films of 1999...
0671042858|5.0|I've read most of Stephen King's books &amp; absolutely loved this one!  It's not a typical King &quot;scary&quot; story, but I couldn't put it down.  It's a &quot;feel good&quot; book and I liked the ending.  I highly  recommend it, although Stephen King fans may not like it as much as it's  not really scary. But it's one I can have my children read and not be too  scared to go to bed at night.
0880389052|5.0|Having not read any other Salvatore books, I was impressed by this apparantly 'background' piece of a character from another series. In it's own right this is a well-written, engaging work. The city of the Drow  underground is believably and interestingly thought out and described, and  the characters well-drawn. Drzzt is well-rounded and genuinely catches your  attention and empathy. An easy book to get caught up in and just enjoy.  Hard to fault for a good fantasy ride - it delivers. Worth buying. I'll see  if he can keep it up for the next book.
B000001FQ8|5.0|Mellencamp really shows his folk roots on this album, and it works very well.  The songs show that Mellencamp is rather weary and despairing.  The masterpiece here is Jackie Brown, which is one of his best songs ever.  The  album ends with the unlisted song Let It All Hang Out, which is fun, in  contrast to the heaviness of all the other songs.  I don't have a bad thing  to say about this one; there isn't a weak song on the album.
B00004TL21|4.0|After producing 2 hard albums, its time for the deftones to take a step back look at whats been done, and think about a little change. <br />The change has come through white pony, although still a rough around the  edges. Songs like 'digital bath' show where the band is heading in this  album. <br />Although there is this new direction things go back to there  normal heavy self in the likes of 'Elite', and others.<br />Overall this album  signals a new path for the deftones, and one where they will wisk you away  and live you thinking. A very thoughtful and emotive album! :)
B00000J0O2|4.0|This toner is great, however it needs to be replaced approximately every 20 reams of paper or every 10,000 pages. Even distribution of ink. Easy to install and remove.
0316777722|5.0|David Sedaris is the definition of the word &quot;unique&quot;.  His writing style is similar to no one else's.  I won't attempt to describe it here but simply know that you will LAUGH OUT LOUD when reading this book.   From his childhood in North Carolina to his adulthood in wild and crazy New  York City to his current life experiement in Paris, Sedaris takes us along  with him for a wonderful ride!  This one is not to be missed.
B00003A9QL|5.0|This cd is a must buy for any Metallica fan and an excellent choice even if you aren't. The way that the symphony blends in with the band is amazing, adding power and variety to the songs. I actually get chills while  listening to many of the songs on the cd, including Master of Puppets, For  Whom the Bell Tolls, and Enter Sandman. These are just some of my personal  favorites, though. Every song on this cd ROCKS and it is one of the most  unique cd's I have ever heard.
B00000K19E|5.0|This to me is quite simply the best film of 1999. After seeing it in the cinema, I thought &quot;a great film&quot;. Then when the dvd came out, I decided to buy it saying what the heck, I liked the movie. There is so much  more to it. You really have to see the movie more than once to capture it  all in. The sound is made for home theatre and the picture quality is  brillant. Also it's full of extras which enhance the viewing expierence.  The behind the scenes feature is great and just basically the story is so  original which sets it apart from the cookie cutter crap which is in movies  today. I put it like a good mystery book. You just want to see more and  more. It's a great, great movie, and if someone has just bought a dvd  player or home theatre system, buy this dvd and you will never forget it.  And they will thank you for it!
B00004STPT|5.0|I really enjoyed Zimmer's work on &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, and this one did not disappoint.  It is very similar to &quot;The Rock&quot; in certain parts with very heroic, rocking beats, but  has more (for lack of a better word) sensitive parts to it as well, and  they complement each other nicely.  THis is a very good soundtrack that  captures well the emotions of the movie, and I would highly recommend it
B000002HEP|5.0|Kyuss are the seminal band in desert/stoner rock, and this album proves exactly that. There are large, fuzzy riffs laid out on top of killer drum backbeats, all with some great wailing vocals. Kyuss's main influence  definitely comes from either Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, and you can  obviously tell that from listening to this great music. The coolest tracks  are Asteroid, No, Conan Troutman, and Odyssey, especially Asteroid, because  of its monsterous riffage and great drums, in fact, some of the best  drumming I've ever heard. All of the other songs are also amazing, but  these are Kyuss at their most awesome. This CD has also some of the best  cover art I have ever seen.... This CD has not only some of the best  cover art I've ever seen, but also some of the best music I've ever heard.  Check out also Sabbath and Karma to Burn.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I thought this was a great CD my first run through.  I love the tracks &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know&quot;.  I had my sister listen to it, and she can't stand this type of music, but it's  catchy and light, just what you need sometimes.
B00004TL21|5.0|the deftones are great. they know how to make a great record. all 3 of their records are equally great but in different ways. Adrenelin was just pure aggresion with emotion. Around the Fur was much more soniclly sound with a sharper edge to it. and now with White Pony, this is just raw  emotion to the MAX. in one word i say this record is RAD, so go get it, if  not only for the pac-man style game on the enhanced part.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Allright all of you who dont like BackStreet Boys , ICP, or any of the other group recently bashing eminem.. He does get back at them with this cd.. He did a great job .. some of the songs are kinda strange but when u  listen to them a few times he is rapping about everyday situations and  giving you the choices that you may not have thought of yet.. One favorite  is track 3 called Stan-f-Dido it is a great song great beat and keeps you  listening to whats going on in the song. I think Eminem did a great job on  this cd i think it i s a must buy for ny one no matter what kind of music  you like it has something for everyone..
630575067X|3.0|When I saw Star Wars Episode 1 in the theater, I thought it was great. But after renting it and watching it back to back with the originals, I realized it was very different. HOLD IT!  When I say different, I don't  mean not good, I just mean different. My point is that this movie has  classic special effects but a fair plot. I didn't like the characters as  much as the original characters because they didn't have as much  guts. The  movie was not as colorful in pace as the originals, but like I said earlier  the special effects are spectacular. I can't wait for Star Wars episode 2  to come out next summer.
0812932293|4.0|This guy spins a great story.  But it's just a story.  Don't expect to get any business insight here.  He seems to succeed thru stubbornness and luck.
B00003CWOL|4.0|Kevin Smith creates an amazing story, with amazing characters (imagine that) in Dogma, his latest movie. Like Smith's other films, Dogma is quit hilarious, but it also conveys a strong message about faith. If you have  reservations about buying this movie due to the religious content, It is  not a catholic bashing movie. I'm catholic, and I wasn't offended.  Regardless, the only down side to this DVD is that Kevin hasn't released a  Collectors Edition. I'm planning on waiting for that copy... but when I do  buy it, I'll be shopping on Amazon.com!
6304057709|5.0|Just recently I viewed this movie after having seen it years earlier. This time with my entire family. We all truly enjoyed it.  Jane Austins novel is performed extremely well. The casting was superior.  Emma  Thompson's crying scene was moving and utterly believable. Kate Winslet  gives a noteworthy performance. What a wonderful period piece with such  royal passion. Easily a movie that could be viewed many times and still  capture interest.
B00004TL21|5.0|if you're a big fan of their older stuff you may not like wp as much because the music definetly has changed since adrenaline. some songs are pretty mellow, but they are still really good. there are also heavy songs  like elite (my fave song off the cd) on the album. definetly a must-have!
B00004TL21|5.0|The Deftone... underapreciated? Maybe. New Album Over Hyped? yes. But it lives up to the hype. The Deftones have conjured up some great textures with the very subtle help of DJ Frank Delgado.  In some cases this is the  heaviest album they've done, in some cases its the most melodic album  they've done, but it is definately the most mature, artistic and  experimental album to date. Chino's haunting vocal melodies are perfectly  balanced by his rage filled screams, The guitar perfectly goes from great  rock riffs to dissodent noise. The bass and drums are incredibly tight. The  album flows beatifuly as do most of the songs with an almost episodic feel.  This is definately one of the most artistic and ambitious albums of the so  called new metal movement. Only band that compares with the ambition of the  deftones and pulls it off in the new metal movement is Tool, whose lead  singer Maynard Keenan shows up on the creepy and almost cinematic  Passanger.<br />This is probably the first great album of the new millenium.  And it is definately the Deftones crowning achievment and should definately  raise the bar on all new metal acts.
B000005ZGZ|5.0|Alright...I've known about this cd for a long time..and even the band fugazi, but I never had a chance to pick up anything by them. I'm very much into indie, hardcore, emocore, inst. indie, etc. and fugazi's name has  floated around in various conversations, articles, and reviews for  years..but I never picked anything up. Well today after years and years of  neglect I picked up &quot;End Hits&quot; and I must say all the hype is  much well deserved. This cd simply rocks...while the songs may not be  singable like other indie/emo/and melodic hardcore bands...it will still  get in your head with all sorts of hooks. Do yourself a favor and pick this  masterpiece up.
B000002BFZ|4.0|Ok, I admit: after listening to Vitalogy over and over and over, at first &quot;No Code&quot; was a dissapointment.  But then after many listens, it wore on me.  Not many people will remember this album for much.  Maybe some  people will remember the songs &quot;Habit&quot; and &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;  which the CBS orchestra preforms ocassionally on the David Letterman show.  Both a great songs.  But, probably the only two songs that rock...there are  others.  But then you might just enjoy mellowing out to the rest of the  songs.  &quot;Sometimes&quot; is a song that just captavates you...you  can't help but relax to it.  &quot;Up in my Tree&quot;: ubeat song...one  you don't want to skip over.  And &quot;Smile&quot;: has guitar playing  similar to Neil Young, and some harmonica.  It's great.<br />A year ago it  would be hard for me to give this album 4 stars, but now I just realize  it's a Pearl Jam masterpiece...even if it doesn't have the high profile  songs of the other albums.
B000002KB8|4.0|My father bought this CD and listens to it all the time in his truck. Now I have heard Black Sabbaths other stuff but never the early stuff. Though it has good music it is not anywhere as good as &quot;Paranoid&quot; or  &quot;Mob Rules&quot;. Actually I would reccomend Ozzy's solo work over any  Black Sabbath album. But anyways, back tho the First LP. It is low budget,  and a bit darker than later Sabbath, but things change. The guitar work by  Toni Iomi is great and he does some really great solos, but his riffs are  nowhere as powerful as they are in &quot;Iron Man&quot; or  &quot;Paranoid&quot;. Basically, this album is just like most metal bands  first, such as &quot;Kill Em All&quot; by Metallica and &quot;Cowboys from  Hell&quot; by Pantera- its good a good start, but it gets better.
B000003RCY|5.0|I was really astonished to find this CD here. I knew they were quite successfull, but I didn't knew, that there music was also listened to in America.  Well as somebody who understands the song texts I can say this is  more then silly &quot;scream-yourself-dumb&quot; heavy metal. The text of  each song deals with a certain topic or is funny to listen to (e.g.:  Laichzeit). Maybe you just buy this CD, you won't regret it.
B000002H97|5.0|The five years that would come in between &quot;The Black Album&quot; and &quot;Load&quot; would be a major turning point in Metallicas career. Metallica would slow down, tone down, and go down. &quot;The Black  Album&quot; is Metallicas last great album. Though not as thrashy as  &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; and not as powerful as &quot;And Justice for  All&quot; it was still hardcore metal. &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; is the  powerful beginning on the CD and &quot;Sad But True&quot; is an equally  powerful second track. Jewels on this album also include the eerie  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and the hyper &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;. But  for my money nothing is better than the powerhouse &quot;Of Wolf and  Man&quot;. &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot; features what might be James  Hetfields best lyrics and its where Jason Newsted gets his first chance to  shine. To sum it all up &quot;The Black Album&quot; is a proper good-bye  from Metallica the metal band- because what would emerge would be Metallica  the POPmetal band.

B00000IQC8|5.0|Clerks is by far one of the best comedies of the last 20 years.  Who would have thought working at a convenience store could be so funny?  Kevin Smith is truly a genius who doesn't mind &quot;pushing the envelope&quot;.  The  realism of the everyday, slacker lifestlye is captured perfectly, not to  mention hilariously.  This is a movie you can watch over and over and laugh  evey time.  See this movie!

B00004T9UF|4.0|Slim Shady, Marshal Mathers, Eminem?   It's not bad but just doesn't compare to the thumpi'n beats of his first LP. He should really work on making more songs like &quot;Stan&quot; and &quot;The real Slim Shady&quot;. Oh yeah by the way, Who is the real Slim Shady? he's already got so many names.  I just hope he straightens out and makes his next album with better thoughts in his mind.
0792837614|5.0|When I first saw West Side Story I cried.  When I watch the video now, I still get misty eyed. Somehow in spite of what some people say,the film is not dated,and probably never will be. Is definitly in my personal top ten  films of all time.  Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are wonderful as Maria  and Tony(And who cares if they didnt sing! ) and what can you say about  Rita Moreno and George Chakiris!  Brilliant brilliant brilliant! I have  stood on the plaza at Lincoln Center and 'listened' to the score and  imagined the dancers there.(Construction was delayed so that Jerome Robbins  could film the dance sequences, I understand.  When the movie first went on  television the tag line was &quot;unlike some other musicals,West Side  Story grows younger&quot;,and its true. It will always have a special feel  and meaning to me!
B000002Q7Y|4.0|Although I live in not English speaking country, I am an old fan of this band. So, I have recently bought this album, but I agree with the other cumstomers' reviews who pointed the lack of violin here. Despite of it, I  consider this album good enough. To compare, one can see my reviews about  &quot;Leftoverture&quot; and &quot;Drastic Measures&quot; albums of this  band.
0790733226|5.0|This movie tells an intelligent story about a possible type of first contact between humanity and an extra-terrestrial civilization.  While that is part of the reason that I gave this movie 5 stars, I was even more  impressed by the director's ability to catch a glimpse of what can be the  dog-eat-dog world of scientific funding, credit and credibility.  <br />Jodi  Foster plays a brilliant, budding young scientist who wants to pursue SETI  (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) work.  Her former mentor (Tom  Skerritt), now head of the National Science Foundation (the government's  primary funding agency for science), sees that work as professional  suicide.  He then does what he can to pull the rug out from under her and  her work.  In the meantime, Foster meets McConaughey, a handsome ex-priest  who seeks truth not via science, but through spirituality.<br />When Foster  recognizes that contact is taking place and she makes that information  public, Skerritt swoops in and attempts to take control of the project.<br />I  am extremely impressed by this movie's ability to tell a great story of a  possibility, presenting the premis of non-confrontational contact.  This is  no shoot-em up movie.  It does, however, have a healthy dose of special  effects, but those effects are not the heart of the show.  <br />There are  interesting plot developments, instructive insights into the lengths that  some scientists may go to gain recognition among their professional peers,  and the conflict that some scientists face when they realize that there are  more ways to learn about who we are and why we are than via science.<br />I  encourage you to give this movie a look.  The combination of story, acting,  special effects, and implications of the story make for a great movie!<br />5  stars all the way.<br />Alan Holyoak
B000001Y42|5.0|This is a really good CD. Indigo flow is the best song. This CD is nothing like Signifigant other so if you bought the other Limp because of the song Nookie don't get this one.
B00004RGUU|5.0|This movie is a real crowd pleaser.  The triangle of Newman, Redford, and McGraw provides the dymanics that lift this story from mediocrity to timelessness.  Newman and Redford play the famous, or should I say  notorious, outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  <br />Being actively  engaged in their chosen occupation, i.e., robbing banks, we follow Newman  and Redford through their adventures in crime.  As a result of their good  work they are doggedly pursued by top law men (&quot;Who are those  guys?&quot;).  Deciding that the heat of pursuit is too hot they, along  with McGraw, head off to South America.<br />A favorite scene of mine shows  Newman and Redford applying for jobs as guards for a gold mine's shipments.   That in and of itself is amusing, but the best part is when Redford has to  prove he is a good shot.  Watch the movie and see how that turns out!<br />The  casting is wonderful, the story line is engaging, the music is great, and  the director does a good job of portraying many aspects, including the  atmosphere, of the old west.  <br />A 5 star movie all the way.  Give this  romantic adventure a look and you'll be glad you did.
B000002HJD|5.0|Jim will always be a &quot;word&quot; man.  Despite his youthful obsession with all things fallic, he could do things with words that no poet ever could.  He put words together that never had been.  And for those of you  brave enough to try, new images began popping up on your mind - of  &quot;Dog men and their mean women, pulling poor blankets over our  sailors&quot;.  What do you see here? Nothing?  The imagery is  phenomenal!<br />The true tragedy is that older, wiser Jim is not alive.  Can  you imagine the work he would be producing if he had given himself a  chance?  Alas, life does not always go the way we want it to.  But you can  get just a glimmer of what it could have been by listening to this album.   If you don't appreciate it, you have only yourself to blame.  Nature rarely  gives us a second chance.<br />&quot;Our spawn abides.  Our master raves.  We're hiding far beneath the alpha waves. Where fish-tailed horsemen tip  their crusted swords. And angels sing, repeating trusted  words.<br />&quot;Engulfed cathedrals tower in their grief. Above projecting,  gentle coral reefs. Attend, she calls, again the ancient rite. Ride the  snake all seven miles tonight.<br />&quot;We will return to stake our rightful  claim. Upon the land, the ghost will find us, Still the same.&quot;<br />Enjoy  this music, my friends.  And may the celebration continue.
0613025326|4.0|This story moved me beyond words. To think that this is a true story and that a farmer's wife from Iowa had the opportunity to experience the rarest type of love that is not only true, but shared. This type of love reminds  you everyday that life is worth living, and that we can leave a lasting  impression on everyone in our lives. This was one of the best books I have  ever read.
B00000JBCP|5.0|I listen to latin music all the time, but not spanish rock.  Then I heard Mana, and I was blown away by their talent.  The music, lyrics and the great rock voice of Fernando.  Mana, MTV Unplugged is the only live music  cd I have because I don't like live music cds.  Mana is the only group that  sounds great live.  If you love rock, give this a try.  If you like latin,  give this a try.  I have become a BIG Mana fan and it was all because of  this cd.
B00003CXFV|5.0|What was the last film I seen with Julia Roberts in? Ah, Runaway Bride, another Romanic comedy, and Notting Hill before that, same genre. So what on earth is she doing in a true-life drama? A lot actually......... I have  to admit, I am a bit of a Julia Roberts fan, but never in my life did I  expect she is this good. No, good is not the right word; Oscar worthy only  comes close. That might make me a bit biased towards her but even the  cynics cannot denied that she has broken her &quot;pretty woman&quot; mould  and become a true character actor, besides Julia Roberts, her co-star  Albert Finney is also excellent as Ed Masery, he almost steels the show  with his subtle and convincing portrayal of Erin's boss and friend.<br />As I  said and you probably know, this film is based on a true-life story about a  woman with no skills who found out something weird is going on and sued a  multi-billion-corporation company and won the largest lawsuit payout in  American history. So what makes this film differ from other  &quot;true-life-dramas&quot;? Well, a lot of the credit must be given to  Julia Roberts, her portrayal of the real Erin is truly convincing. Her  performance brings the character to life; the audience can truly FEEL the  way she felt, I've seen this film twice in the theatre and it's just as  good the second time around.<br />The script is sharpe, some of the dialogue  from Erin is really humorous, and the drama is dealt with care and  precision. This is true movie from Julia and from director Steven  Soderbergh, another masterpiece to buy on DVD.
B00004TL21|3.0|This cd is mellow and soft. It's nothing like there other cd's. The 1st 2 cd's are for hardcore moshing this sounds like a mix of Dave Mathews Band and the smashing pumpkins cd -ADORE!  If you listen to the lyrics its  pretty cool. But if you want something for rocking out get one of there 1st  cd's. This is music for falling asleep!
B000002I69|5.0|What can be said about this CD, it is simply brilliant. The two tracks, &quot;Truth&quot; and &quot;Koto Song&quot; are enough to make this one of the best Jazz CD's I have heard. Even the rather overly played &quot;Take  Five&quot; is inspirational on this CD.<br />Get This CD!
0792833686|3.0|A great film.  But the DVD left me wanting.  Though the picture looks crisp and bright, this DVD is the only one I've encountered with NO subwoofer channel output...nothing.  It's advertised as being in 5.1, but  lack base frequency.<br />I must also complain about the lack of an  accompanying commentary -- especially since the laserdisk version contained  one of the best commentaries I've ever heard; by the late film historian  Ronald Haver.  Such a shame this DVD seems to have been slapped together.   Is this the way to treat the greatest musical ever made?
B000001FI7|5.0|This album is wonderful. However, even if it wasn't it would still be worth 5 stars just for three songs - &quot;Sour Times&quot;, &quot;Wandering Star&quot; and &quot;Glory Box&quot;. While this music may  not be to everyone's taste, these songs transcend  musical bounderies and  touch some higher level of emotional expression. They are restrained yet  have an instant impact on how the listener feels and perceives their own  lives.<br />BUY, BUY, BUY
B00004TL21|4.0|A wonderful and textured cd that breaks the Deftones away from the Korn/Limp Bizkit rap/rock garbage and shows the world how much better than that crap they really are. Keep an open mind and get this record.
0767843789|4.0|If you have ever thought of becoming a wise guy you have to see this movie. A great combination of a wonderful script and terrific acting by both pacino and Depp. It portrayed the dangers of vouching for the wrong  guy in a colorful and entertainning way. For Mafia fans this is a must see.
B000023X9W|1.0|Yikes.  The title of my review is a lyric from one of the songs on Silver and Gold.  <br />Could he be any hokier?  Neil is doing himself and the result sounds tired and lifeless.   The album is bogged down by repetition; nearly  every song mentions love in some fashion.  &quot;Love's the answer, and  love's the question,&quot; he sings in &quot;Horseshoe Man.&quot;  In  &quot;Distant Camera,&quot; Neil looks back at life and pulls out the tired  image of old photographs as he sings, &quot;If life is a photograph fading  in the mirror, all I want is a song of love to sing for you.&quot;  Lyrics  this trite shouldn't be allowed to be released. I'm happy that Neil is  satisfied and content, but it doesn't make for captivating music.  <br />Neil  has been comparing this album to After the Goldrush, and I've never heard  anything so insulting.  This album doesn't compare to that magical album in  any way.  Silver and Gold is mirrored by Comes a Time, an acoustic album  from 1978 that completely fails to challenge.<br />There are a few songs that  do compare favorably with his past work.  The title track, a song that's  been around since 1982 and which has been recorded 11 times, is a  meditation on love that actually works.  With a beautiful melody, he  proclaims that &quot;our kind of love never seems to get old, it's better  than silver and gold.&quot;  &quot;Without Rings&quot;, the song that  contains the hideous &quot;software&quot; lyric mentioned earlier, actually  contains a sweet melody that Neil sings in a voice much lower than his  regular singing voice.  It's a variation that this album could use more  often.<br />As a longtime fan, I hate to say it, but Silver and Gold is one of  Neil Young's worst albums.
B000005QH3|4.0|I first viewed this movie in the early seventies and was most impressed by the powerful Dodge Challenger and Charger from the film. Mopars from that era were pretty scarce out here back then.  The storyline was a bit sketchy  in places, but the car chase scenes were good, I am pleased that they  didn't destroy genuine musclecars. One of my friends was until this movie a  one-eyed Ford man, he converted to Mopars and has stayed with them since.  The 90's remake of the movie has a better ending, it doesn't leave you with  the stunned empty feeling that the original does.
6300267997|3.0|This movie is not by any means a GREAT film, but it does has its strong  points. Kristofferson hits a bullseye as a hard drinking washed up rock  star, and though the music they selected for him to sing is not that great  (why didn't they let KRIS write some????), he gives it a sort of authentic  charm, and most Kris fans should find it listenable. Other than  &quot;Evergren,&quot; which is a great song, Streisand's songs in the film  are mostly pretty bad, and she lacks feeling in this role. In fact, the  major downfall for this movie is that Kris is so believeable in his role,  and Barbra is not. It creates a sense of unbalance. Perhaps they should  have let Rita Coolidge play his wife? At least then the roles would have  been more balanced and the film would be considered historically more  important (Rita does appear for a few seconds, with Tony Orlando.)
B000002NE4|5.0|The other reviews say it all - buy this album, you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it.
B00004TL21|3.0|I just brought this CD home from the store and after listening to it for three times I still have mixed feelings about it.  Much more serene and quiet than their first two albums.  There is no Blind or 7 Words on this  one and overall I feel that something is lacking from the CD.  If you do  not yet own Adrenaline or Around the Fur you should buy those first but  this is still a fairly good album though a bit disappointing from this  band.
B00004TL21|2.0|After 95's adrenaline and 97's around the fur.  I was very excited for this album to come out.  What a big dissapointment.  All the songs seemed to be 4 minutes of noise. If you want to get a real deftones cd get around  the fur. It is there best one.
6305750750|3.0|For those of us who grew up watching the &quot;Original&quot; trilogy, this is an interesting peek into the history of the Star Wars universe, although I think Jar Jar's character was a bit too comical for the movie, I  like the CGI effects and how the characters inteacted.  The down side was  that there wasn't the air of mystery in the force (we learn that it's  generated by microscopic creatures in symbiosis with living things) which  is a big disappointment for me.
B00004THAY|5.0|What more perfect release date for this work than the week before the start of summer?  The voices of King and Clapton don't always quite work together, but the results are fine and take me deep into the hazy nights of  summer just as good blues should.  I just hope these two had the  forethought to videotape their sessions - it would be a priceless  documentary, one I would I love to see.
B00000IQUT|4.0|The film does what &quot;Last House&quot; tried to do and while &quot;Last  House&quot; failed fairly miserably, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; takes  on a very realist and humanitarian vantage point.  It places you in a world  of agony and suffering as it explores the inhumane condition of a young,  fair figured woman brutally raped by a gang of vicous savages whom express  no regard for human life.  Its depressing atmosphere provokes the thoughts  of its viewers.  It is not gory but manages to be graphic in its nature all  the same. The let down comes in its slow-pace and 45 minute rape/nude  marathon through acres of woods scene.  Cinematically, the spacious  lanscape is briefly glimsed as the woman crawls from its womb, yearning to  reach her cabin where her perpentrators already await with more eager  sexual anticipation.  One character in the gang can envoke sympathy from  the viewers being that he is a misfit only scourging different branches of  society in search of his place within it.  The critical moment comes when  he rapes this woman, who he had earlier befriended.  The film takes a while  to evolve from its genesis and the viewer feels strung out by its slow  development.  However, those who stick with it will find their patience  does not come without its rewards as what they once mistook for an  exploitave, sleaze film is actually more-or-less an indepth look into human  ideology intertwined with an aspect of revenge and blood lust on the  woman's part.  NO character is left undefined, crucially, in death their  guises of masculanity and overpowerment slip revieling the fear they  carried deep within them all along.
B000002U82|5.0|This is very good music, which makes you feel as floating in the air. The quality of the sound is superb, and the aethereal sensation of the music (after Alan Parsons engineered it) has not equal even in today's  synthesizer age.<br />In my opinion, is the best prog rock album after Tales  of Mystery and Imagination by Alan Parsons Project. Contrary to other  reviewers, I think APP is far better than Pink Floyd.
6305265488|5.0|I was intrigued by this movie the first time I watched it. Then after the  second time, I was addicted. I guess I want to say that this one is an  absolute must for any true romantic. It's one of those rare movies that  makes you believe that there is still such a thing as TRUE LOVE. What a  refreshing thought.
B000006NUW|5.0|Bill Inglot does it again. The songs featured on this Hitsville box are the mono single mixes and they have a bottom to them that just pounds out of your speakers. The high's on the songs are clear and bright. In fact, at  first listen I never wanted to hear these songs in stereo again. Just put  on Love Child and listen to that bass drum slam down with a opening,  thunderous boom!<br />My only disappointment was not in what was on it, but  what was not. Four discs are not enough. They should have given this the  Stax/Volt treatment. Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye all are  underrepresented. Also, the packaging lacks a little care. The back of the  box lists the songs but not the artists.<br />These aside, what is on hear is  terrific and is worth every penny.
B00004TL21|3.0|compared to adrenaline the white pony is very different and softer. while adrenaline is better this isnt a terrible change. this new softer sound gives the deftones more of a chance to foucs on melodies, such as in  digital bath and rx queen. dont worry though, the deftones have totally  lost there hard sound as shown in street carp and passneger featuring the  singer from tool. the track pink maggit is a trippy and weird song but  good. elite is just an awful song sounding like an industrialized type song  but otherwise the white pony is a very good album just dont expect another  around the fur or adrenaline
0553213342|4.0|In what used to be Jane Austen's epistilary novel, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood struggle with their extreme, and conflicting, personalities in a male-dominated society where they must come to terms with the death of  their father, their subsequent near-impoverished state, and disappointments  of the heart.<br />This is the second Austen novel I have read and I must  confess to being charmed by the bond between the sisters despite their  utter lack of understanding when it came to each other. Both Elinor and  Marianne love each other and try to understand one another. Elinor tries to  protect Marianne by attempting to counsel her to curb her sensibility while  Marianne advocates her own romantic outlook to her older sister. What each  of them fails to realize, until the novel's end, is that without the  presence of the other in times of trouble, they would not have a leg to  stand on.<br />Both Elinor and Marianne take each other for granted and it is  to the reader's gratification that Elinor and Marianne do find  satisfactory, and happy, endings when they each adopt a little of the  other's philosophical outlook.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Michael Crichton's novel gets the Spielberg treatment, doing for dinosaurs what Jaws did for sharks.  Sam Neil, in his good guy persona (a la Dead Calm, not Event Horizon!), and Bruce's daughter Laura Dern (Nic Cage's wife  in David Lynch's Wild at Heart) play the husband and wife paleontologist  team invited to view a monumental advancement in amusement park technology  by billionaire oddball Richard Attenborough (Ghandi director who failed in  his Great Escape years earlier).  Jeff Goldblum (The Fly and that Pilsten  Hols /Apple advertiser) makes another canny mega-movie appearance (remember  Independence Day?) as a chaos mathematician also along for the tour.   Samuel L. Jackson is seriously wasted as a lowly computer technician - his  `action' career took off over the next three years with the triple whammy  of Pulp Fiction, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, and The Long Kiss Goodnight.   Throw in Dickie's grandkids, Bob Peck (Slipstream) as a big game hunter,  and a nerdy insurance/accountant type and you've got plenty of fodder for  the real stars of the movie - the animatronic and Silicon Graphics  generated dinosaurs!  Most full body shots are computer generated, most  body part shots are animatronic - who cares when the effects are so  gobsmacking and seamlessly integrated.<br />There are plenty of holes to pick  in the plot if you want to get scientific, but that's not what this film is  about.  It's a terrific rollercoaster ride of a film that all the family  (except the smallest maybe) can hold hands together to watch.  One point  that many argue is the velociraptors were only six-foot long and half the  height of humans - Spielberg obviously wanted more dramatic impetus.   Strangely enough, during filming scientists uncovered evidence of a  10-foot-tall variety, now named Utahraptors - so how's that for a bit of  Spielberg magic?<br />The soon to be released DVD edition is a Universal  Collector's Series (like Dragonheart, End of Days, Fast Times at Ridgemount  High, Conan the Barbarian, and many a Hitchcock classic) and Universal  rarely puts a foot wrong with these specials.  Expect a first class  transfer -especially since it's taken Spielberg long enough to approve the  release, and maybe throw in some trailers in the Universal showcase or  recommendations sections, and this should be one memorable monster movie  release!
B000005JAX|5.0|If you are a DM fan you must have this record. It combines Martin's taste with this perfectly selected songs. The whole album should be listened carefully because its details have been placed very carefully. Compulsion,  the first song, is my favourite and i always place it into my ten  favourites, In a manner os speaking is simply gorgeous, the way Martin  sings it makes me think that some covers may be better than the original  song, in this case, Gore's profoundity was sent towards the sky and his  voice is just the one this song needed, the arrangements are also  excellent. Motherless child is the other song that makes me say this record  is excellent, in fact the hole album is great but this song is soooo deep  that you could fall into catharsis because of the feeling that Gore melted  this song with.
B000002H2Z|5.0|Whenever I hear the first drum beats of this album, I get a smile on my face.  Since listening to this album for the first time in the winter of '86, I've savored every note, every word, every emotion, every second.  It  is truly one of the finest releases of the '80's, yet the music really is  timeless.  It's a happier Cure than found on &quot;Faith&quot;,  &quot;Pornography&quot;, or &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;. Don't get me  wrong, those albums are excellent, but &quot;Head On The Door&quot; was a  new direction for Robert Smith and company.  The lyrics on this album are  still dark, twisted, and thought provoking like earlier albums, but they  are matched with a lighter, happier sounding music.  Even on tracks like  &quot;Sinking&quot;, and &quot;A Night Like This&quot; where the images are  dark and brooding, the music is unlike any they've done before.   I love  this album.  It always seems fresh and vibrant...even after all these years  (15 to be exact) &quot;The Head On The Door&quot; still makes me happy to  be a Cure fan. <br />Track highlights from &quot;The Head On The Door&quot;?   Hmm, they're all great but if I had to pick...&quot;InBetween Days&quot;,  &quot;Six Different Ways&quot;, &quot;A Night Like This&quot;,  &quot;Push&quot;, and &quot;Kyoto Song&quot;.  Some of the Cure classics by  far.<br /> Although the Cure has come to the end of the road in what has been  an amazing musical career, I thank the musical gods that looked upon Robert  Smith, Laurence Tolhurst, Porl Thompson, Simon Gallup and Boris Williams  during the making of this excellent album.  Five stars?  Nah, I give it  six.
B00000K0DV|3.0|THE NEW YORK RIPPER  [Lo Squartatore di New York]    (Italy - 1982)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Techniscope)  Theatrical soundtrack: Mono    It's virtually impossible to defend THE NEW YORK RIPPER on any level - the film's up-front misogyny provides director Lucio Fulci with the flimsiest of excuses for several landmark splatter scenes in which beautiful women are stabbed, slashed and razored to death in graphic, lingering detail. Abandoning the Gothic fantasy of his 'Golden Period' (1979-1982) which spawned such miniature  gems as ZOMBIE and THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY, Fulci's grim examination of the sexual excesses of contemporary New York follows a stereotypically hard-boiled cop (Jack Hedley) in pursuit of a  psychopathic killer who's been murdering a succession of women in the Big Apple, most of whom are depicted as prostitutes or depraved sluts with a taste for rough trade. Yeah, it's that kind of a movie...    Despite a mild twist near the end which throws the killer's identity wide open, the plot has few of the intricacies normally associated with the giallo thriller and instead relies on splashy set-pieces to maintain forward momentum. Luigi Kuveiller's hand-held camerawork evokes an appropriately realistic milieu whilst also making the film looked rushed and sloppy (this is the same guy who photographed Argento's baroque masterwork DEEP RED!), while  the cast does its best with the ungainly dialogue and amateurish dubbing. The standout is Alessandra Delli Colli, playing the beautiful wife of a rich cripple who records her sexual adventures on audio tape for her husband's pleasure, until she finds herself tied to a bed beside a man who may (or may not) be the killer! Given the frankly unpleasant nature of some of the material she's asked to play, her performance here demonstrates a  level of commitment which goes way beyond the call of duty.     Overall, the film exerts an undeniably sleazy appeal, and while the target audience will certainly admire its audacity, others will be appalled by its uncompromising scenes of horror. Either response is equally valid.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of the best cd's i have ever heard if you dont like rap buy this cd if you like rap by this cd Stan is the best rap song i have ever heard it is so touching it is about this guy who loves Eminem and is  writing these letters to him then in the third verse because EM hasn't  answered him he is going to send him a cassete telling him that he is  killing himself but he forgets to send thee tape out then they find him in  the water under the bridge and EM hears it on the news then writes to Stan  and at the end of the letter he realizes that it was Stan who drove of the  bridge. the rest of the tracks hold their own but cant stack up to stan.
0679601686|5.0|Let me tell you about my first impression of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. At the age of thirteen, it was one of the most amazing love stories I had ever read. Five years later, it became one of the most  wittily crafted stories I had ever read. By the time I was twenty-one, it  was the finest work of literature I had ever experienced.<br />Elizabeth  Bennet is a byproduct of genteel poverty. The second daughter of five, she  possesses the most sense, tact, poise, and sound judgement of the family in  general. On the other hand, she is also irreverent, daring, and  judgemental. She stretches the envelope of what might be construed as  &quot;polite&quot; society. She also acknowledges the limitations of her  gender even as she subtly tries to defy them.<br />As a part of the landed  gentry, Mr. Darcy is the embodiment of all that is dignified and honored.  He is a gentleman who was born to privilege and money. His kind make up the  &quot;polite society&quot; Elizabeth dares to flout. His pride, his  disdain, and his arrogance make him unappealing to the people of Longbourn,  as well as the community surrounding it. It is his interference with the  relationship between his friend and her beloved sister, however, which is a  personal affront to Elizabeth.<br />It is fortuitous that Austen retitled her  book because First Impressions does not begin to touch upon the  complexities that Pride and Prejudice, as a title, connotes. In Darcy and  Elizabeth, Austen has drawn two very complex characters who, on the one  hand, seem simply drawn and characterized, but on the other, are so much  more than they seem. It would be easy to say that Darcy is arrogant and  Elizabeth is willful. The truth is, looking beyond my own first impression,  as a reader, Austen has deceptively crafted two characters whose thoughts  and actions make it clear that they aptly straddle both of the title  characteristics.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sure many great songs are missing, but this is the essential Sarah album. It has all great songs, and is the one CD in my collection that I can listen to from beggining to end. I like the different sound of &quot;Hold  On&quot; making me enjoy the soing, whereas on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy I  didn't like that version. For people who like the CD I recommend get EVERY  single other CD she has made. But this is a good first CD and a good  sampler of her wonderful inspiring talent.
B000002BSG|5.0|Deze CD hoef je niet te kopen. De muziek is meer van het zelfde en niet vernieuwend. Ik zou een CD van PRINCE kopen als ik iets dergelijks wou hebben. De bal gehakt die dit heeft gemaakt is alleen maar een slechte  imitator
B00004TL21|5.0|I have always thought of The Deftones as a great band, but never as one of my favorites. I always thought they had more potential then their last 2 releases displayed.  That was until they unleashed the White Pony! White  Pony is on of the most excitingly genius albums that I have heard in a long  time. Its softer then the last 2, but softer doesn't make it any less of an  amazing album. Besides, this album contains prehaps the hardest deftones  song you'll ever hear, Elite. Other songs such as Digital Bath, and RX  queen display a softer side of the tones. However the softest,most melodic,  song on the albun is Teenager. It almost reminds me of a Smashing Pumpkins  Song. My favorite song on the album, is Passenger. It has vocal stylings  from not 1 but 2 outstanding singers! Chino, of corse, and Maynard James  Keenan of TOOL/APC! The Deftones have changed their line up a little. Chino  is now cretited as Vocals/Guitar, and they have added the sound  effects/scratching/keyboard of Frank Delgado. Who adds a real ambiant feel  to the whole white pony experience. If you don't pick up this album you are  missing out on an amazing experience! Because Y2K is the year of the White  Pony
B00002MMQ4|5.0|This is Oasis' first album release (jap.) and it's a real rock and roll CD.  It starts off big with &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Star&quot; and it travels on a big road of rock through &quot;Shakermaker&quot;, &quot;Live  Forever&quot;, and then it mellows out for a while with &quot;Sad  Song&quot; a bonus track, and finally, some &quot;Supersonic&quot;,  &quot;Slide Away&quot;, and finally the classic &quot;Married With  Children&quot;.  It show how Oasis has been a great band from the  beginning.
B00004TL21|4.0|Just bought the CD.  I like it quite a bit.  It's a logical progression from the last album, taking the music in a more emotionally mature and complex direction (and a completely different feeling altogether).  The  Deftones have now given us 3 different albums for 3 different all-around  experiences.  I have a feeling that I'll be listening to this one often.   \\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\" had already grown on me through  fairly generous radio play.  \\"Passenger\\" (with guest vocalist  MJK) is so very beautiful.  I would have paid $13 for the single.  There's  still a heaviness in volume, it's just that they've slowed it down,  sacrificing speed for a more substantial weight.  People, inevitably, will  yell \\"sell-out\\" (if they haven't been saying that from the 2nd  album, as the current trend seems to dictate) but those looking for a band  to grow and expand won't be disappointed with the Deftones' latest release.   It's an emotionally charged album, sonically impressive and showing  undeniable signs of growth.
B00000JBWV|5.0|What a find! My children bought this &quot;album&quot; for me in the 70's. Perhaps it was the year their father and I were divorced.  This album is filled with so many &quot;events&quot; and emotions that were part of my  life for years.  &quot;I Feel The Earth Move&quot; makes you move and  bounce for joy and could brighten up a sad mood, while &quot;So Far  Away&quot; seemed to relate to the fact that while married to a Navy man,  we were often parted and it would make me sad. Carole's singing her song  &quot;Natural Woman&quot; was different from the wrenching Aretha version,  but definitely made you KNOW you were a strong powerful sexy woman when you  sang along.  It also gave the kids something to laugh at as they watched  you singing and grimacing. Now almost 30 years year and grandmother of  three, I can tell my grandchildren about the best Christmas gift their  parents bought me.  Thank you for having it available for me to play at  peak volume as I am driving along in my Jeep.

B0000067X1|5.0|Even prog. and Kraut rock fans like me still think that tago Mago by Can is completely out of one's imagination. THe first half (Paperhouse, mushroom, oh yeah and hallelujah) you can still call &quot;rock&quot;  (well,if you want to. Weird structure plus superb drum and bass... not  necessarily &quot;complex&quot;, but always unpredictable). The whole aura  is an unique strange Inner-Space studio production. THe melody is also  impressive too. Paperhouse is dense, while Mushroom is very groovy and  funky, suggesting what to come in &quot;Egg Bamyasi&quot;.  The real  challenge is the second CD. Completely chaotic studio effect+ improvision  and jammed lyrics... I could just say that it's Schizophrenic... unless you  have a fatal amount of LSD you won't experience these sounds... (just a  metaphor, don't really go to try LSD)... if you don't believe listen to  Peking O and Have Coffee or Tea you will know. Take about 3 times listen to  really enjoy this. The first time not count, it will make you scared, but  the second time you will know something, the third time you will wonder  &quot;is it the limit of rock?&quot; Too excellent.  Try &quot;egg  bayamsi&quot; if you like the song &quot;mushroom&quot; very much.
B000003TAR|5.0|The story as old as punk itself, a band gets famous and from then on only writes cheesy love songs with out any crunch in their guitars and drive in ther drums.        Nirvana came in with the brash but safe, Nevermind,  which is hailed as one of the greatest albums of our time.  Most people  expected a follow up even more accessible and mainstream than the prior.         Kurt was completely at loss at the amount of success he had with  Nevermind.  There was an overwhelming desire to rid Nirvana of all the  fickle adoration of all the gravy-trainers.  That's where In Utero comes  in. Its expected upbeat melodic opening ,Serve the Servants, tricks the  listener into thinking that it's Nevermind all over again, but our good  friends, the ears are not immediately ready for what comes next.       The  first time this listener heard the album through he turned it off,  disgusted.  But after several times through, hearing every intricacy of  rythm and every change in voice from shriek to angelic, it was impressed  upon me that this is one of the greatest albums ever.  Cobain was the  greatest songwriter of our day.       So a lesson unto you, oh wise  punk-rockers. Remember who you are and what you stand for.  Not to win the  hearts of every teeny-bopper in the mainstream,  but to go against the  grain and be as painful as possible.  Rid yourself of gravy-trainers so you  can live with youself.
B00004T9UF|1.0|This cd was so offensive to the beautiful Christina agulara and to his wife kim and women and gay men it makes me wish i didn't buy it.  The only good song on there is stan... But that isn't that good so if your out there  and thinking of not buying it don't bother.
630521610X|5.0|A serial Killer, wearing a ghostface-mask is killing teenagers in the small town of Woodsboro.<br />A fame-seeking reporter, a wannabe cop and off course the surviving Heroine Sidney are the ingrediants of this  re-invention of the slasher genre, which was only present in the back  corner of some videostore for the last 10 years.<br />Wes Craven, the man who  brought Freddy Kruger onto the silver screens and into our nightmares,  cooperates with screenwriter Kevin williamson and they make you laugh and  scream with there masterpiece SCREAM.<br />Scream begins with a phone call  that will make motion picture history as well as the terrifying murder  scene that follows it. It was the first time ever I found myself sitting in  the theatre biting on my nails and hoping she'd make it...<br />After that  furious entrance to the movie, the story is explained and the characters  are being introduced to the audience. Sidney Prescott, whose mother has  been killed just a year ago, her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Hello  &quot;Halloween&quot;! , Moviefreak Randy.......<br />All those characters are  so well written that you have a real relationship with them and you really  care, what's gonna happen to them because the ghostface never  rests...<br />The brilliance of SCREAM lies in its irony. Scary movies exist  in the world of sidney and her friends an they know how they work. So you  have to play by the rules, if you want to survive. The camera work in the  first installment of the Scream Trilogy is the most innovative of these  three movies. The camera often photographs the events in a slightly odd  angle which reflects the uncertanities of the characters. (I hope I didn't  spell that wrong..)   Adding to this is the beautiful music of Marco  beltrami. In his first soundtrack, he surprises with a wonderful  melancholic theme for Sidney and some decent suspense-music.<br />Speaking of  suspense. There's a lot of it in SCREAM but not as much as I hoped there  would be because thebeginning was so impressive, the rest of the film  couldn't keep that pace. The shock audio-shock effects are very rare in  this one and they don't actualy work pretty good.<br />So I guess I told you  enough about SCREAM.. now you'll have to see for yourself...
B00004T9UF|2.0|I heard this CD when it first came out, and was... well, disturbed.  If you thought his first album was bad, wait till you get a load of this.  However it is not without its merits.  &quot;Stan&quot; is a pretty good  song.  For all those who got a kick out of his previous album, this one is  for you.  For the more sane among us, I suggest you skip this CD and  purchase something not quite so... weird.
6305810109|5.0|What a masterpiece of dialog, photography, and acting from Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek that is completely natural, uncontrived, and powerful! If you want a movie that makes you FEEL, this is the movie for  you. Nobody is manipulating you here.  Here, you are presented a marvelous  story, quiet and real people, and a sense of place that you can't help but  become engaged in.  Watch this on a quiet rainy afternoon with someone with  whom you share a connection, and this movie can become another soulful  memory you share with that person.
B00004TL21|2.0|I SO wanted to love this CD, I really did. I have had a copy for months before it came out, so I have gotten the chance to REALLY listen to it. &quot;Passenger&quot; with Maynard Keenan from TOOL fame is the first song  I heard off the CD. After hearing what came to be my favorite song off that  cd, I proceeded to listen to the rest of it with the same expectations. I  just could not get into that whole &quot;be quiet and drive&quot; vibe  through the majority of the CD. &quot;Elite&quot; is a good track, and a  lot like the harder stuff they are known for. Im not giving this CD 2 stars  because it's not hard enough, but because I don't think it is that great.  &quot;Aroung the fur&quot; had WAY better song structure. I am sure you  will listen to this CD and right off the bat you will day &quot;All  right!&quot; and love it. But just keep listning.....BUT if you are a TOOL  fan, I highly recomend listning to &quot;Passenger&quot;. Maynard and Chino  are awesome, and that is a creepy song. Have fun!
0312853238|5.0|In this age of marketing, advertising and intensive information exchange, superlative adjectives tend to be overused and abused.  How can everything be unique or spectacular, for then good would surely be reduced to average?  However, certain books (like any work of art or product/commodity) turn  out to be true Classics, with broader and broader appeal; they actually  improve with age as fine wine.<br />Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, can only  be described as a true classic.  It is a unique and brilliantly written  work that keeps the reader enthralled and entertained throughout.  The  novel reads better now than when it was first published twenty-three years  ago.  The first book in a series (now five books total) of stories that  revolve around lead character Andrew (Ender) Wiggin, Card weaves a totally  believable universe containing two completely incompatible and utterly  at-odds interplanetary species.  One is the human race and one is a society  of creatures known only as the &quot;Buggers&quot; due to their resemblance  to insects.  Earth society has temporarily suspended international  hostilities to join together and fight the alien menace.  This  international cooperation spawns a worldwide recruiting process to  identify, gather and train the best and brightest child minds.  The  ultimate goal is to mold them into leaders of the future human  attack/defense forces against the alien Buggers.<br />Card does an amazing job  of relating the thoughts and fears of children in the story, who are almost  exclusively the main characters.  Also, he provides the characters with  passion, strength and emotions that one would expect to see in children  pushed to the brink of endurance.  Title character Ender Wiggin is  unknowingly pre-selected to lead the human forces pending his successful  training regimen, and the majority of the novel focuses in the time period  Ender spends training in Card's wonderful invention, the &quot;Battle  Room&quot;.  The Battle Room and the &quot;Battle School&quot; are the main  reasons this novel is great SF.  It combines futuristic scientific  applications that seem only just outside of current human reach, such as  interstellar travel and control of gravity, plus the wonderfully depicted  psychological interplay of a group of the most talented and aggressive  youths the planet has to offer.<br />Stylistically, Card is an excellent  writer.  His dialogue is top notch, and readers become very interested in  the characters he aptly portrays.  He uses strong, active verbs, that keep  you on edge and reading the story way past bedtime.  Recently, Card  published the fifth novel in the series, Ender's Shadow, which retells the  same story from the angle of a different character.  Fans already familiar  with the series will find the desire to re-read Ender's Game to  cross-reference the newest addition to the Ender Universe.  Like many great  works by Jules Verne, appreciation of the Ender Universe continues to grow  as time passes.  The exponential increases in current technology in recent  years only help bring Card's ideas into sharper focus and greater  believability.<br />This is a must read book for all that claim to be fans of  the SF genre.  However, the story also stands on its own with exciting  action sequences and exceptionally likeable and well developed characters.  It was both a Hugo and Nebula award winner, which is validaion to give it  an automatic read for most SF fans.  Do so, you will be glad you did.om and the &quot;Battle School&quot; are the main  reasons this novel is great SF.

B00003CX5A|5.0|I liked this movie because I like Tim Burton a lot, and that may make the difference between did you like it or did you not like it?  Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci did a really good job, and Christopher Walken (I think  that's his name) also did a really good job playing the Headless Horseman.   (with his head on, of course.  When he didn't have his head it was all a  stunt man.) Besides for the gruesome decapitations, it was all in all  pretty good. (but then, gross killings are Burton's style.) Added to the  fantastc soundtrack by Elfman it made a stupendously good film.  I would  recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.  And if you can, see it  on DVD.  It's got special features on it that aren't on VHS.
B000001DQI|5.0|This is Elton and Bernie on top of their game. Their best effort ever and one of the greatest rock 'n roll recordings ever. This mixture of ballads, dreamy tunes, and hot rock numbers took us by storm and had us singing and  humming these great songs for a long time. Bernie Taupin weaves a great  story in every song and Elton's clear singing let's you hear the story  without grabbing for the lyrics sheet. When Elton puts his beautiful music  behind Bernie's beautiful lyrics, you know you're in for more than just  rock 'n roll. Some songs on this got more playing time than others, but  there is not a loser in the bunch. If you could only have one Elton John  recording, this is the undisputed heavyweight champ.
B00004TL21|5.0|Its a long awaited and now that its here it just rocks.  Theres a mix of mellowness and rock being combined on the album.  The sound quality is excellent as are the effects, you'll understand if you play this on a  pro-logic system.  Its good to hear a band actually work to make their  songs all well written and played.
B00004TL21|5.0|White Pony is the most mature Deftones record yet.  Intense melodies mix with brutal guitar riffs to form the foundation of such tracks as &quot;Elite&quot; and &quot;Knife Prty&quot;(sic).  &quot;Digital  Bath&quot; and &quot;Teenager&quot; are ballads that explore new ground for  the Deftones.  &quot;Passenger&quot; matches Maynard James Keenan's vocals  with the music of the Deftones in a haunting collaboration.  For the third  time now, the Deftones have delivered all that fans have asked and more.   Rising above such bands as Korn and Limp Bizkit with sheer musical genious,  the Deftones rule.
B000001FI7|5.0|This album effortlessly displays how great the mid-nineties were in terms of music.  This will continue to fly the flag for the nineties, and will continue to make the eighties look as void and empty we all knew they were  at the time.<br />You really should own it, if for no other reason than it is  historically imperitive!
B000000WG4|5.0|A good test of a great recording is how much playing time it gets from your collection over time. Tubular Bells is one of the most reached for CD in my vast collection and for good reason. It's not a temporary fad style,  a money making gimmick, or a typical one or two hit album with  fillers.  This is fantastic sweeping music that can't be pigeon-holed into some  genre. It is blend of instrumental wonders played by an extremely talented  musician. This isn't party music or something you dance to or play to  teenagers. This is orchestral splendor that is best enjoyed when you are in  a contemplative mood. I am a huge Oldfield fan and this is undeniably his  very best effort.
B00004TL21|4.0|Limited to only guest appearnces on Cypress Hill's &quot;(Rock) Superstar&quot; and Sevendust's &quot;Bender&quot;It's been a while since we've heard from the Deftones and the album's definitely been worth the  wait. Chino's songwriting has definitely improved, as well as the band  itself.   &quot;Passenger&quot; with Maynard is simply amazing, as is  &quot;Korea&quot;. This record is such a different record from &quot;Around  the Fur&quot; and &quot;Adrenaline&quot;. If this rescord is any indication  on how the Deftones have matured in sound, they will continue to improve  down the years.
B00004RFFL|5.0|The best part about this movie was that it was suttle and did not require all the blood and guts to be thrilling.  I just loved the ending.
B000001GK9|5.0|Ok, this is Karajan...but not the one you know, and possibly, hate ! This is one of the few LIVE recordings Karajan made during his life. And that means NO STUDIO EDITIONS.....that he liked so much..... In some aspects, or  in some points, others could have made better than him, but in the overall  performance, and specialy IN THE LAST MOVEMENT, this is for sure, the  recording to choose ! Just listen to the almost 27minutes-long Adagio and  tell me if you haven't felt the spirit of Death near you.....!
B000002GQE|5.0|This album broke down barriers and only the Moody Blues could merge with a symphonic orchestra and produce one of the finest recordings ever made.  Their sweeping mellow, storytelling music blends perfectly with a full  symphony and the Moodies vision and talent at that time needs to be  applauded. Some people nitpick over the quality of some songs being better  than others on this, but taken as a whole, The whole thing flows seamlessly  from beginning to end. You can actually visualize each part of the day as  each song plays. This classic recording is best when listened to from start  to finish. It's no wonder the Moodies launched into stardom from here.  Enormous talent like theirs had to be recognized sooner or later.  Fortunately for them it was sooner.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is the album we long time Maiden fans have been awaiting since Seventh Son.<br />With both Smith and Dickinson back in the lineup, the explosive chemistry that Maiden had in the 80's is back, but with much more  musical maturity.<br />Each song is fresh, but the chord progressions are  classic Iron Maiden.<br />Definitely worth a purchase for the long time and  new Iron Maiden fan alike. Well done, guys!
0316777722|4.0|Ok. If an author can make you laugh about a drug addicted infant being murdered in a washing machine (check out **Barrel Fever**), he's either the funniest thing going...or you're just a sick so and so...<br />Hmmmm. kinda  makes you wonder....<br />Anyway, This is another hell-larious collection of  stories by one of the funniest authors to grip a pen. The first half of  this great book kinda extends on the Sedaris family lore that was touched  upon in Barrel Fever and Naked. We learn about David's mom who perks up the  Easter baskets with tobacco products, his dad who has an unusual warmth for  rotting fruit, his brother The Rooster (not to be confused with the family  pet) and his wickedly funny sister (amy sedaris from the comedy central  show 'strangers with candy').<br />The second half of this riotously funny  book is a string of tales of Davids (mis)adventures as a misanthropic  American in Paris. Gene Kelly he is not...but that's what makes it so  smashingly silly...<br />I really dig this book because it has that rare  abiltiy to make you laugh out loud. And that's priceless in itself. I also  really dig this book because while reading this, part of you will be  thinking 'this boy really has problems...what a screwy family...' and the  other part of you will be thinking 'Oh, my gosh...that reminds me of my  sister...that reminds me of my crazy father...'. Which ever camp you're  sitting in, this book will charm you right out of your seat... David  Sedaris may talk pretty someday, but he writes amazingly right now.... xo
B000002KDG|5.0|Disco had the charts, punk rock and new wave had the critics.  What could possibly come from dinosaur Neil Young in 1979? Well those who were fortunate enough to see his &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; tour in late 1978  already knew.  This album was recorded at various stops on that tour and  remains one of rock's finest efforts.  <br />Sometimes reffered to as Neil's  &quot;answer&quot; to punk rock, I think of this album more as a tribute.   Neil saw punk as the lifeline for rock, which had grown increasingly  stagnant over the decade. Accordingly, Neil is more furious and inspired  than ever before.  <br />The album is divided into acoustic and electric halfs  with neither besting the other.  The acoustic songs are gorgeous, lyrically  baffling, and quite torrid. &quot;Hey Hey My My&quot; is a stirring song  about rock and the music business.  &quot;Thrasher&quot; remains Neil's  ultimate statement of individuality, while &quot;Pocohontas&quot; revisits  his destruction of the Native-Americans motif.<br />For the flip side Neil  adds Crazy Horse and turns out four of his most brutal jams.  &quot;Sedan  Delivery&quot; is perhaps the closest to actual punk rock, but is the  reprise of &quot;Hey Hey My My&quot;, now electric.  Full of glorious  distortion and feedback, the song is an untoppable close to a near perfect  album.  <br />Because of its dualistic nature that shows off both Neil's  acoustic and electric leanings, I think this is the best record to get  acquianted with Neil's legacy.
B000000I0J|4.0|A fresh new sound from Oldfield, and the first four tracks are smashes and sound best played in that order. The other tracks dabble around with  Celtic overtones and various mood pieces. Punkadiddle is a rousing number  that I always visualize a quartet of athletic Greek dancers performing to.  Why Oldfield included a dubious remake of &quot;I Got Rhythym&quot; I don't  know. Perhaps he just ran out of gas and came up with this filler. C'mon  Mike, you are much too talented to rehash someone else's works.
B00003CX59|1.0|Never mind that this movie only borrows the names and some story elements from Irving's book and ignores the story.  That's fine, if Burton could come up with a good story to replace it with.  Burton fails epicly,  creating a nightmare that is so unbelievablly conventional you'd swear it  was directed by commitee.  Worse still, Burton manages to get nothing out  of his talented cast:  Depp fidgits his way through the film, Ricci is  utterly forgetable, and Walken--a man who is almost by his very nature  terrifying to watch--manages to be completely unfrightning, screaming like  a fool in scenes that would be comical if they weren't  pathetic.<br />&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is at the heart of it all the most  expensive B-movie ever made.  Burton, substitutes decapitations for chills  having someone graphically and unrealisticly beheaded everytime he wants to  frighten his audience, but the cheap plastic heads that litter the ground  in this film only remind the viewer that this is hollywood not the town of  Sleepy Hollow.<br />And Burton's much praised visuals are merely dark.  Never  are they actually moving or fightening.  Burton seems convinced that if he  washes the color out of all his scenes this will automaticly create  atmosphere.<br />Burton, sleep walks though his role as director and  jeopardizes his reputation as an inovative film maker.  One moment when I  just threw up my hands was when a (supossedly) emotion and tense scene  between Depp and Ricci draws to a close and she leeps on her horse to ride  away.  Before she takes off, her horse rears up and nays a la Silver.  It  was that moment I realized this film wasn't just bad it was nothing more  than a endless string of movie cliches, many of which weren't all that  inovative the first time we saw them.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Ok. I debated this purchase for about two weeks. I looked at itfrom a cost stand point ($! yikes) but you have to devide that by 3cd's. Or better yet, devide that by 69 amazing songs. Very cheap cost if you think about it... So, I bought this collection and it is one of the most sound purchases I have ever made.<br />As the historians tell it, there were supposed to be 100 love songs written for a boxed set. Somehow 100 turned into 69 and the rest is musical genius on 3 discs.<br />If you're not familiar with the sound of the magnetic fields...think They Might Be Giants (circa FLOOD) or a new wave Tom Waites (circa Small Change) or the punk rock Burt Bacharach. <br />I have found that disc two is my personal favorite...with songs like the poetic 'Very Funny', the 80's new wave inspired 'If You Don't cry', the spector-esque 'Washington DC' and my personal fave 'Papa Was a Rodeo'. Yee-haw.<br />Disc one holds just as many gems but i think they would mostly be considered b-sides. Take for instance the swank 1970's show tune wanna-be 'The Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side', the uber minimal 'punk love', or the coulda been a Johnny Cash hit in 1968 'Chicken With Its Head Cut Off'.<br />Disc three is my second favorite of the three Cd's.  The stalker anthem 'Im Sorry I Love You' is fun, The traveling menstral vibe of 'The Night You Can't Remember' and the lo-fi buck rodgers vibe of 'Strange Eyes' are ...'as lovely as a tree...'. Also, I can just hear 'Underwear' as a back drop for a Haines commercial in 2010. <br />If you are looking for something new and origional look no further. Amusing, Inspriational, Arty and fun. Steven Merrit scores a 3 way home run.
B000023X9W|4.0|Despite the fact thats he's released about 40 albums Neil still can turn out novel and interesting songs. &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; did take quite a bit longer than usual and has songs dating back to the mid 80s, (title  cut and &quot;Razor Love&quot;) but the album is all the better for it.  <br />Most of these songs were played on Neil's 99 Solo Tour, giving him ample  time to perfec and fill them with the nuances present in these versions.  Additionally, he adds his minimal but sublime cast of studio musicians to  round out the sound. Most notable is great slide guitar from Ben Keith.   <br />This album is definitely comparable to the &quot;Harvest&quot;,  &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;, &quot;Comes A Time&quot;, and even &quot;After  the Goldrush&quot;, but still is a relatively unique item in Neil's  disography. Its got a fairly strong country/bluegrass feel, but more  importantly Neil's voice is clearer and better than ever.  He sings with  great fondess on each song as he looks back across through his life.  The  whole album feels very content.  At my young age I'm afraid the sentiment  of song of the songs is lost on me, but the album still flows incredibly  well. <br />I've found this album to be especially effective in introducing  people to Neil, especially women who would give me annoyed looks when I  tried to play &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; or &quot;Tonight's The  Night&quot;. That pervasive relaxed sound is simply agreeable.  <br />I do  kind of wish Neil would have included three other staples from the '99 tour  that were sacrificed to CSN&amp;Y's &quot;Looking Forward&quot; on this  album. (&quot;Looking Forward&quot;, &quot;Out of Control&quot;,  &quot;Slowpoke&quot;) Those songs could have pushed the album to classic  status.  As it is the album is it heart-warming engaging listen. Great for  a rainy day or a romantic evening.
B00000J0O2|5.0|Well the most important thing about buying ink and toner for your printer is price, and Amazon.com has beaten every on-line price I have seen. As for the toner itself, Hewlett Packard toner is top. I buy this product for two  reasons, 1. It's what fits in my printer, and 2. I know when I buy the  C3906A, I am getting what I payed for, a quality cartrige that lasts. One  last note, twords the end of the cartrige life, a small line appears in the  content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one. simply  shake the cartrige, reorder, and by the time the new one arrives, the old  one is finished.
B00004TL21|5.0|What an album!  This highly anticipated release lives up to every expectation. There was speculation about the deftones creating a lighter, more polished sound. Being a big fan of the crunching metal riffs of  Adrenaline and ATF I expected this album to not be as appealing. However,  after hearing the first track, 'Fietceira', I was blown away. Those who  think the deftones have abandoned their heavy sound are mistaken - tracks  like 'elite' and 'korea' is metal at its best. It is true that The White  Pony has a new sound. There are many tracks that do not have the same  aggressive feel like '7 words.' but the deftones have not failed in  creating a brand new sound that captures attention and releases energy.  This change of style is definately not a disappointment like Metallica's  'Load' or Korn's 'Follow the Leader.'
B000001FLA|5.0|I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that this album is what all other Yngwie releases are compared against.  This CD unofficially introduced the world of lightning fast, neoclassical guitar playing even  though Rising Force and Marching Out were released earlier.  The reason is  the songs.  &quot;You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget&quot;, &quot;Queen  In Love&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, and &quot;Magic Mirror&quot; boast the  best metal guitar solos in recorded music history.  Yngwie has never  matched the emotion and creativity of the instrumentals &quot;Crying&quot;  and &quot;Trilogy Suite&quot;.  There is one major clunker in  &quot;Fury&quot; and to me, &quot;Liar&quot; is Yngwie's most overrated  song.  Mark Boals is an average singer - high, shrill voice, very little  range of emotions.  However, these do not take away from what is one of the  defining CD's in metal history.  CLASSIC.
B00000BKE1|4.0|Having listened to Maiden since 1985, when I was in fifth grade (\\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" rumbling from the basement bedroom of a friend's older brother was my induction into the Rivetheads), I remember liking this  record when it was released. Henceforth I had all but banished Maiden to  the realm of Nostalgia, not necessarily because of this record.   Since  returning to Maiden and to Metal upon learning of the Reformation and  re-exploring their records, I think Fear of the Dark is a decent bookend.   I think there is a lot of good material there, despite the oft-mentioned  filler (Judas, Weekend Warrior), although I DO LIKE THE APPARATION.  I  thought it was light, catchy and just fun.  Upon first listen, the record  didn't grab my ear, but it has grown on me over time.  I think the whole  band was going for a new sound, a different style.  Less emphasis on twin  guitar attack, for example. Same goes for Bruce; his improv soloing on Fear  is the Key, case in point. Hey, I respect them for trying something new.   At best, it worked, at worst, the material was uninspiring.  The title cut  regains their confidence; unsurprising, as stylistically it is a Maiden cut  worthy of their name. I think they were tempering elements that are used to  much greater effect on Brave New World (I can't comment on the interim  albums, as I haven't heard them).  I've never felt the production on Fear  of the Dark was \\"bad\\"; quite the contrary, although the snare is  noticeably soft. Actually, I like the mix because it's more stripped-down,  a sound perhaps they were trying to achieve.  As far as ranking it with  previous records, I like it more than No Prayer, but it lies in a cloudy  area. It hasn't broken my CD player, but judging by the other reviews here  I think it is underrated.  Give it a chance!  UP THE IRONS, RIVETHEADS AND  METALHEADS 4EVER!
0790729385|5.0|Allright..let's all calm down. I too can go on about how this favorite of mine has scared me since I was a kid and how it still does to this day, but, do you know what's really scary? Some members of the '90210&quot;,  &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; generation might watch this  film and laugh!  They'd watch &quot;Halloween&quot; or &quot;Night of the  Living Dead&quot; and doze off or say something like &quot;I thought it  would be more like &quot;Scream&quot; (which is what I once overheard after  a screening of &quot;Psycho.&quot;) IIIEEEEE!  Where is the respect and  appreciation for the classics? Perhaps Film History should be a mandatory  course in High School from now on instead of say, Ceramics. Which would you  rather do - watch and discuss a great movie or get all messy creating  something that vaugely resembles a vase?
B000002LQR|5.0|This is the other side of early '90s alternative rock, the side that had a badly needed sense of humor.  The Chili Peppers have always had just the right attitude: passionate about the music but never taking themselves  seriously at all.  This is where everything &quot;clicks&quot; and they  deliver an album better than anything they had done previously, or since  (although everything &quot;clicked&quot; again last year for  Californication--and it's not like their '80s albums weren't enjoyable).  Yes, the album sprawls perhaps a bit too much, but there are no bad songs  and everything seems to fit.  A couple overly goofy moments (a Robert  Johnson cover! ) are more than made up for by sweet ballads like  &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; and &quot;My Lovely Man&quot; and rocking  funk/punk numbers like &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot; and &quot;Funky Monks&quot;  And who can forget &quot;Give It Away&quot;?  The blend of funk, punk,  rock, and even rap has never been equalled since; few bands (Living Colour  and the Bad Brains are two of the only ones that come to mind) have ever  been able to successfully occupy this stylistic niche.  Of all the Chili  Peppers' albums, this is the best introdction for the casual fan, and an  essential purchase for anyone who like music, period.
B000002H70|5.0|Twenty seconds of quiet chimes start what, in my opinion is one of the most brilliantly crafted albums ever made. One of my favorite things about this cd is the unusually long intros some of the songs have. Fascination  Street has a 2 1/2  minuet intro before singer Smith comes in. I love it  because it takes its time. Its so incredibly focused on what it wants to  be, and absolutely solid as a  rock. Solid in its musical tone, solid  lyrically, solid production wise. The Cure's careful and tasteful choice of  synth sounds separate it from most of  the cheese to come about in the  80's. This stuff still sounds modern and fresh 13 years later. It just gets  better as it gets older.    And what is Lullaby about anyway? I don't know  anything about Robert Smith but if I had to guess, this song sounds like   its about a heroin addiction. \\"On candy striped legs the spiderman  comes... and I feel like Im being eaten by a thousand million shivering  holes and I  know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering cold  and the spiderman is always hungry\\". He sings it with such fright,  What a great song!    This album is bleak as they come. So why does it make  me feel so wonderful? I don't know. Its just so brilliant, it carries  you  away. If I could keep only one CD, this would be it.
B00000J7J4|1.0|It's very sad when a man can win 8 grammy's for an album he didn't even write. I was under the impression that Carlos Santana was a man of integrity....NOPE. First, before I go on and describe how terrible the  music on the album is, I will elaborate on why this was the best sell out  in the history of music. Not the history of rock and roll, not the history  of jazz or blues. But yes, the history of music itself. First of all,  Carlos is credited for writing three songs. Smart move Santana, lets get a  bunch of modern rock stars to come and make an album for me, so I can sell  millions of records. Absolutely ingenious. Supernatural should instead be  called &quot;Santana plays guitar with modern rock stars&quot;. <br />I can't  describe how frusterated I am with this. First of all, there are two good  songs: Smooth (overplayed and, yes, overrated) and Put you lights on with  Everlast. The rest of it is just bubblegum pop, other than some bad latin  songs. <br />Don't get me wrong people, Santana is, no, he WAS a great  musician. &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; was a great song, and I have his  greatest hits. But with &quot;Supernatural&quot;, he got away with the  biggest sellout ever.
B00004TJTQ|5.0|This is a story about a boy and his puppy and growing up being each others bestest buddies. To this day i always thought BABE was the best &quot;animal&quot; movie but not anymore. This one is a very enjoyable  &quot;family&quot; movie that is suitable for all. being a dog owner i  really appreciate the companionship a pet brings and the ending left me  weak. Many in the theatre where i went to see this flick were in tears and  it was a movie that entertained as well as touched ur heart. If u only see  1 movie this year do urself a favor and view my dog skip....u wont be  sorry!
B000002HH9|2.0|History. I am one of those die-hard Cure fans who has bought every album, and has loved them since 1986. I've listened to so much Cure that I'm sure I've grown a special lobe in my brain just to house their music. SO WHAT IS UP WITH THIS DRIVEL?<br />The Cure has never depressed me, at least not until  I bought Wild Mood Swings. The best thing about it is the title. Robert  Smith's voice is resplendent as always. And the first song is worth  listening to. But that's it. I can't even stomach the rest of the album.  It's trite. Musically it's banal. Melodically it's cliche. There's just no  vibe.<br />I'm not some total goth who dislikes it for it's pop value...  actually I like a bit of cornball pop, and have eclectic musical tastes,  normally running towards hard and heavy rock. But the Cure has a special  place in my heart, and it's only because I love them so much that I will  dismiss this monstrosity. Furthermore, they have created plenty of poppy  songs that I did like, in early days, ie. Love Cats, Friday I'm In Love,  Boy's Don't Cry, etc... but those were good songs:) If I had never heard  the Cure before, and Wild Mood Swings was my first exposure I'd put them  right up there with all the other...out in the past 5 years. If I owned  a Hansen CD, this one would be sitting next to it on the shelf.<br />Actually,  I lost it some time ago, and never did buy it again. It's the only Cure CD  I don't own.
6301025083|5.0|from what i have read in fellini interviews and his own writings, he was not a terribly interesting person.  we can feel comfort with that in academic studies until the bulb flickers, and the first scene of this movie  start.  this is probably the first of the film making films that dive to  the gut of artistry.  alcoholism, hedonism, selfishness, ridiculous.  he  makes a film about being alive, italian, frustrated, alive, a film about  coming to town with a plate of meat and cheese at your beck and call, and  then wanting to send it through the window for no other reason then it is.   fellini, like fante, felt what it was like to be italian.  like goddard  knew what it was like to be french.
B000005H4K|5.0|Put three legends together in a studio and you you can't be sure what you'll get. Fortunately, in the case of &quot;Money Jungle,&quot; the combination of Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Max Roach produced a  superb performance that bristles with musical genius.<br />Don't worry if you  sometimes find piano trios -- particularly those recorded in the studio --  lacking an edge. Ellington, Mingus and Roach bring enormous vitality to  every cut on the release. We get the best of all worlds here in that you  can feel the room crowded by three big, strong musical egos. But you can  also hear the respect the three have for one another in the way they listen  to each other and aren't afraid to give each other plenty of room to  speak.<br />Mingus's enormous tone on his bass leads the way into many of the  tunes, including the opener, &quot;Very Special,&quot; but Roach makes  plenty of room for himself, dominating, for example, &quot;A Little  Max,&quot; inappropriately named only because the tune is a lot of  Max.<br />Ellington's playing is superb throughout. So many of his  compositions are marvels of sophistication and exquisite taste and subtlety  that it's pleasantly surprising to hear him remind us of his blues roots  with earthy tunes like &quot;Rem Blues,&quot; &quot;Switchblade,&quot; and  &quot;Backward Country Boy Blues.&quot; Then there's the delicate beauty of  the wonderful &quot;Solitude.&quot; I'm not always much for alternate  takes, but I was glad to hear this great tune a second time. <br />&quot;Money  Jungle&quot; reminds us that sometimes in jazz, there's not much new under  the sun. While it was recorded in 1962, it sets a standard for jazz trio  that we can see now has not often -- if ever -- been met.
0783225970|4.0|Al Pacino is one of the best Italian actors of all time. He plays a Cuban gangster so well that one can mistake him for being Spanish. The use of the 4 letter F word are perfectly justified in this type of movie and I see no  problem with it at all. Crime doesn't pay, but Tony Montana sure does make  it look like fun. He finally suffers his demise in the end but not without  a glorious final segment. This movie stays with you long after you watch  it. It's 3 hour time length make that possible--in no way too long at all.  This reminds me of &quot;GoodFellas&quot; and other Mafia flicks. Pacino's  reference to Italians in &quot;Scarface&quot; is hilarious. Check it out  now.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I'm 46 years old. I have seen/heard other rock/orchestra mixes in the past, namely Deep Purple and the London Royal Philharmonic, but these were &quot;concept&quot; things with all new material that no one was familiar  with. Metallica pulled this off using their own known past material with  excellent orchestral accompaniment by the San Francisco Symphony conducted  by Michael Kamen. For those unaware, Kamen was the lead singer for a 70's  band, New York Rock &amp; Roll Ensemble. The boys' and Kamen's effort is  about as awesome as I can conceive, on both VHS and DVD. Hearing the band  and the orchestra together gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. If  Metallica were to tour with the orchestra, I would easily pay in exess of  $100 per ticket for seats in the back. It is THAT stupendous and  captivating.
6302054982|5.0|GoodFellas took me inside. It made ME a part of the Mafia and I still felt like I was living inside Henry Hill's mind days after I watched it. The film is more than a docudrama about Italians in organized crime, but a film  showcasing mouth-watering Italian dishes, the close affections of Italian  culture, and tons of hilarity. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Robert DeNiro  star in their finest film roles I have ever seen. This movie will make you  proud, scared, happy, sad, and with a final feeling of awe. Extremely  entertaining, no mob movie comes close. No movie comes close. Buy this film  today.

B00004T9UF|5.0|I got &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; when it first cameout. I must say that it is a crazy cd, alot of people don't likeEminem because he's white. Well, I'm black and I love his music.  I think Eminem has gotten a little personal with this album.  I like the songs on it but, I think the songs on &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; are funnier than he's new one.  Don't get me wrong I still think that his new LP is great, you gotta go get it.

B00003CWOL|3.0|It's rare to get a comedy that's both brainy and hilarious; it's just too bad that the writer/director is so much better as a writer than as a director.  You don't have to be a lapsed Catholic to relate to this movie,  but it helps; and I can see why so many uptight religious fanatics  protested--I mean the &quot;buddy Jesus&quot; idea proposed as a reform of  the standard crucifix is gut-busting funny, and certain to send the  fanatics for their picket signs.  Despite the film's premise grounded in  Catholic... well... dogma, this movie could have found a broader audience,  had the direction not been so weak.  This guy needs a Filmmaking 101  course.  Scenes are set-up in the most obvious way, and there is very  little creativity in the camera work. I found myself dozing at  times--despite the offbeat hilarity of much of the concept and writing.  Still, if you like your comedy dark and intelligent, this movie is worth a  watch.

B00001OH7Y|5.0|A high point of two leading musicians' careers. Songs cut from patterns designed by the master tailor Bowie, carefully and deliberately ripped to shreds by Fripp. Weird, psychological attire with which to signal new  expressionist interests. Back to theatre again, but this time it's not Kemp  but Brecht. A subplot is the invention and immediate dismissal of new  romanticism. Art Pop done with imperial style by two of its originators.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Majestic.Beautiful.Moving.Touching.And a lot of feelings that cannot be put into words.From the intro,to the last minutes of the album,a complete serie of emotions shake the listener.From the power of  &quot;Mirror,mirror&quot;,to the sorrow and despair of &quot;Noldor(Death  winter reigns)&quot;,or &quot;Thorn&quot;.This is a must,for the Tolkien  reader.And for those who are not into Tolkien,well,you can find a whole new  world that you  never thought of.While reading the lyrics,you can find out  that Blind Guardian gives a new dimension to the Tolkien writings.The  music,and Hansi's singing give a new meaning to the Tolkien world.It simply  leaves the listener breathless.A masterpiece.
B00004TL21|5.0|Depth, layers, twisting and turning textures...this is what &quot;White Pony&quot; is all about! The boys have done it again, continuing with the growth evident from &quot;Adrenaline&quot; to &quot;Around The Fur&quot;. A  stand-out album in 2000 and in the whole genre.<br />The seething, boiling  rage is still there - pure and untouched. It's just channeled and expressed  with more maturity, nuance and sophistication now. The Deftones make more  use of texture, contrast and atmosphere/space in the music on this album to  get their point across. It makes the music more compelling and even more  dark and haunting...listen to the brilliance of &quot;Digital Bath&quot;  and &quot;Rx Queen&quot; to hear what I mean -- brooding rage played with  grace and finesse.<br />There's more variety here...different song structures,  experimentation with different beats, layers and instrumentation, more  contrasting sound choices...but make no mistake, THIS IS THE DEFTONES. They  have not made the classic mistake of &quot;growing&quot; so much that they  sound disjointed, incoherent...or like another band altogether. It still  bears the classic Deftone scars....relentless, oppressive, biting guitars,  pounding bass, precise, grooving drums...and Chino's sensual, keening,  expressive vocals.<br />Some of the best, most aggressive riffs the Deftones  have come up with are on this album...check out the fury of  &quot;Elite&quot; and the syncopated, chunky metal-laden &quot;Street  Carp.&quot; More textures and sounds coaxed out of the guitars on this  release.<br />Also, Chino has grown by leaps and bounds. His sultry, whispery  howl is still present...but he explores the higher registers more often  (singing, not screaming) and there is more modulation and shading to his  voice, more of a sense of melody and nuance. And there's vocal harmonies at  some points...a virtual first for the Deftones. They work. But do not fear  -- Chino's blood-curdling, savage screaming intensity is still in full  force.<br />Once again, the secret weapon of this band is Abe Cunningham...the  drumming on &quot;White Pony&quot; is full of precision, monstrous grooves,  tension and release, and coloring and subtlety. Abe gives the songs breath,  momentum and finesse. Great stuff.<br />There is absolutely no filler here. So  picking standouts is tough...but don't miss &quot;Feiticiera&quot;,  &quot;Digital Bath&quot; (with a riff/motif that will stick in your brain),  the haunting yet melodic &quot;Knife Party&quot;, the monster groove of  &quot;Korea&quot; and the absolutely scary &quot;Passenger&quot; -- a  collaboration with Maynard James Keenan of Tool and A Perfect  Circle.<br />Groove that will stand your hairs on end.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I wasn't a Britney Spears fan until the release of this album. Her songs before were cool, but I could never bring myself to buy the album. But I bought this one and it's great!   Every song is awesome. The fast ones make  you wanna dance, and the slow songs make you wanna sing right along with  them. She's an awesome performer w/ great talent!
B000002ADT|5.0|What is amazing about Miles Davis is that he reached KIND OF BLUE's peak on a number of occasions over the course of his nearly half-century career, and each time the music differed significantly from what is heard  here!<br />What is amazing about KIND OF BLUE is that the music seems to  satisfy the listener at whatever level they would like.  If you want to get  deeply involved emotionally with the music, it leads you there.  If you're  a musician looking to pick apart the music, you'll discover a level of  sophistication attained by very few.  If you just want to relax, the  outward appearance of the music is as pleasant and inviting as any  so-called smooth jazz.  If you want to hear memorable improvisations, Miles  and John Coltrane lead the way by offering solos that avoid predictable  licks in favor of fresh twists within virtually every phrase they play.  If  you want to hear teamwork, the whole roster of stellar musicians present in  the studio for these sessions knows how to create together, when to play  and more importantly, when NOT to play!  If you want something timeless,  the music forever retains its freshness and contemporary feel.  Yet if you  have a nostalgic twinge for the cool, acoustic jazz of the 1950s, this  music will give that unique sound to you...and then some!
B00004TL21|5.0|The Deftones have always been one of my most favorite bands, and this new album is them at their most touching and inspirational. Though not as loud or heavy as past efforts, this one still delivers a punch. There are more  fine tuned guitars, more thunderous drums, and even softer melodies. There  are more rainy day type songs, like Change, but there are also ultra heavy  emocore songs like Feiticeira, which is one of my favorites here. There is  a guest appearance by Maynard James Keenan of A Perfect Circle and Tool,  which is on one of the longer tracks. The possibly most beautiful song here  is Teenager, which is my most favorite song here. I haven't really had time  to fully recognize this CD, but the highlight tracks here are Feiticeira,  RX Queen, Teenager, and Street Carp. These songs definitely have odder  titles than previous Deftones' material, but they are definitely more  thought out, too. If you like this, check out Far, [minus], Simon Says, and  Liberty 37.
0393317552|5.0|Reading Diamond is a bit like getting into an engrossing conversation while riding on a train.  Suddenly, you realize that the train is at the final stop, while you were supposed to get off three stations back.   Diamonds prose is so excellent, his arguments so compelling, his answers to  questions that most of us had never thought to ask so persuasive that it is  someting of a  surprise to finish the book and realize that he has gone too  far.  Geography may be important, but surely it is not everything.  If it  were, why was Taiwan primitive while Japan was advanced and wealthy?  Why  was Holland the wealthiest province on the continent while Denmark was a  nation of peasant farmers?  Why did northern Italy lead the renaissance  only to fall into backwardness, before resurging to become a powerhouse of  twentieth century industry?  Culture matters.   Nevertheless, we are all in  debt to Diamond.  Rarely are such important ideas presented in such a  well-written book.  David Fisher's Albion's Seed comes to mind, and Diana  Muir's recent Bullough's Pond, but it is rare to find someone who is both  an original thinker and a good writer.
B00004TL21|5.0|The deftones are still kicking it with there new CD The White Poney. I was one of the fortunate 500,000 to get The Limited Edition that gave me a few more bonus tracks. I have always loved the deftones and this CD is a huge  exception. Every track just kicks, the CD is a little slow but Chino Moreno  makes you feel like you are him and really expresses his feelings in a very  well organized manner. Right now my favorite song is the 1st track. Go buy  this CD it is the best.
B000002UAX|5.0|As an early Beatle fan, I had no particular plan as to which order I listened to my Beatle music...therefore the transition from Meet The Beatles to The White Album was jarring yet wondrous, and it left me  clamoring to quickly gather all of the jewels in this band's legendary  catalog.<br />This album comes to life with the rocking Back In the USSR and  from that point on the Beatles do not allow you to relax.  They change  tempos and moods with Dear Prudence, get you clapping with Ob La Di Ob La  Da, and leave you scratching your head with Bungalow Bill.  As the album  progresses, it continues to drift into oddities like Happiness... and it  culminates with Revolution #9.  As a final curve ball, the syrpy Goodnight  ends the masterpiece, and all you can do is stare at your stereo in stunned  silence.<br />This is a testament to the creativity and diversity of the  greatest rock band of all time.  <br />This is the album that made me want to  become a musician.  <br />Add this CD to your collection....now!
6305265488|5.0|I work as a contractor employee at NASA.  I know I am supposed to love movies like Contact and Apollo 13... and I do... but I can deny it no longer, &quot;Ever After&quot; is my favorite movie.  The plot is the Cinderella  story with a couple of captivating twists.  Instead of a fairy godmother,  there is the genius Leonardo De Vinci, and Danielle (Cinderella) can  actually think for herself.  Although I love the plot, there are so many  other stunning details that make this movie a masterpiece.  These include  the setting, the costumes, the casting, the characters, and the historical  tie-ins.  Now, I haven't dug up my old history books to verify the details,  but the historical links draw you in and make the story seem less like a  fairy tale and more like reality.  The bottom line is that I absolutely  love this movie on so many different levels.  This is a classic, and much  much better than any other telling of this story I have ever seen or heard.  It is a Masterpiece.
0881030856|5.0|The characterizations and story are charming all the way and it's even believable that such things could happen at the time you are reading it.  A basic, good story and applied to the rabbit cast in expert fashion.   Although the rabbits more or less act like humans, they are still  recognizable as rabbits and are very interesting because of it. A basic  good and evil story, with good triumphing.
158234082X|4.0|Mr. Bourdain has a great deal of fun in this expose'-confessional-cum-autobiography.  In most cases he's able to take the reader with him, which is the great news about this book.  <br />It  appears some readers are recoiling at the various New York City culinary  nightmares, sexual escapades, and drug addled shifts on the hot line  described in his myriad employment experiences.  These anecdotes aren't  terribly unique or repugnant, but they feel more objectionable while  occurring in the exalted confines of Manhattan restaurant kitchens.   <br />While not necessarily good form to bash the industry that feeds him so  to speak, I love the way the book balances (and in some cases simply  pummels) America's recent deification of the &quot;celebrity&quot; chef,  reminding us that there is glory to be found in a good broiler man who  shows up to work on time.  Shouldn't he or she get some of the credit for  making your braised lamb shank into origami - 300 times a night?<br />The book  is a little disjointed and repetitive in places, particularly when  describing the derelicts Bourdain has worked with, and their chemical  alterations.  But he clearly loves them, and loves his work without apology  for any antisocial behavior as perceived by those without permanently  disfigured line cook's hands.  And that's what makes this book so  compelling.
B00004TL21|5.0|...and it is about time, too.  I'm not sure what to say about 'White Pony'.  I just got finished listening to it for the first time, so this review is my first impression, and it reminds me of 'Around the Fur' more  than 'Adrenaline'.  This album is full of the hooks that made 'Around the  Fur' such a catchy and good album (but if you don't have adrenaline, you  better get it).<br />I must say that the Deftones rhythym section is extremely  tight, and it hasn't been tighter than on this album.  The percussions are  very technical and are followed up by bass lines that seem to never miss  that right hit.  Its refreshing to listen to.  I'm a big rhythym section  listener (being a drummer and all), and these boys are talented.<br />The  vocals are unique in this age of scream to soft lyric arrangement that we  hear so much.  The formula is the same, but the voice is different.   Harmonizing seems to come natural with the blend of scream and whisper that  comes through the mic, and is even soothing (as strange as it may seem) at  some points.  When 'passenger' played I thought Chino had really gone in a  different range, but wait a second!, that isn't Chino, its the one-and-only  James Maynard Keenan.  Yes, thats right, we have a guest spot from the man  himself on this album.  Not to mention that it is one of the better songs  on the album.<br />'White Pony' is worth your money.  I wondered why I payed  20 bucks for the limited edition (I got the black one), until I popped it  in my computer.  The limited edition is also an interactive cd, a la albums  like Primus' Rhinoplasty.  This one is also considerably longer than  previous Deftones releases, running in at almost 55 minutes of constant  play time.  All in all, great album that won't disappoint fans.  I'm going  to listen to it again right now.
B00003BDXG|2.0|An overlong, criminally dull movie by Oliver Stone, a director not noted for his subtlety. Here, he tells the tale of a pair of murderers who become a national obsession before vanishing underground. A bit like Terrence  Malick's 'Badlands', but with an iconic ending. Actually, it's a lot like  'Badlands', only - crucially - whereas 'Badlands' was a masterpiece,  'Natural Born Killers' isn't. Towards the end of 'Badlands', there's a  short sequence in which policemen pose for a camera with a chained-up  murdered played with otherworldly charm by Martin Sheen - 'Natural Born  Killers' tries to be like this, but with a sledgehammer, for two hours.  Stone assumes that, having made the cutting point that people find  superficiality thrilling, and that the media reflects this, he doesn't need  to actually make a film within which to store this nugget of information.  And so there isn't one - what would have been effective as a commercial is  stretched out to two hours, complete with oodles of superficially stylish  cinematography - given that this is Oliver Stone, the irony is probably  unintentional. It's like the poetry of Jim Morrison - stylishly delivered  by a cultural icon, but not very profound at all. Everything else - story,  acting, characterisation, is subservient to the style and 'message', and  looking back after seeing at the cinema I found it hard to focus on  anything that stood out during the two hours I had spent watching it. The  ultra-violence and satirical tone make it particularly hard to say bad  things about, as any potential critics can be easily dismissed as prudes,  or people who just don't get it.
6305842442|1.0|I won't go into that whole Original Vs. Director's cut debate. My feelings side with the director on this one.<br />What I can't believe is Warner Bros. treatment of this film. Why re-release &quot;Blade Runner&quot; if you're  not going to add anything to the disc? The frame of film, lobby cards and  posters are nice, but as a film enthusiast - and a fan of this one in  particular - I'd much rather have director's commentary, or at least some  trailers or featurettes. Surely a documentary isn't too much to ask for,  considering everything that people seem to NEED to say about the movie.  (There were nearly 300 reviews here alone when I wrote this.)  I can't  believe one of the best and most influential science fiction features of  all time is getting the Paramount DVD treatment! (Star Trek DVDs have  virtually no features either.)<br />I suggest you save your money and look  through Amazon's book area for a book called &quot;Future Noir&quot;, as it  appears to be the closest thing we're ever going to get to a documentary or  director commentary.<br />Great film, disappointing package. &quot;Blade  Runner&quot; could be so much more on video.
0767817478|2.0|Enormously hyped, with an advertising campaign that ran for over a year, this follow-up to 'Independence Day' had all the explosions and effects of that earlier film, but with none of the charm, or indeed anything else. At  all. The absolute apotheosis of the 'big-budget effects movie', 'Godzilla'  is quite literally an excuse for a set of CGI / model shots of a big  monster tramping around New York. Handled well, this might have been  enough, but it isn't handled well - it borrows liberally from elsewhere,  and tries for a post-modern, self-mocking tone that fails through a lack of  wit. It all seems as if it has been processed through a big mincer, with  all the flavour or interest washed-out, just like the gloomy skies in the  film. Despite the omnipresent rain and gloom, the effects are well-done -  they have to be, as there is absolutely no other reason to watch this film.  None at all. There must be a script there somewhere, as I can remember that  the story made sense, but I can't remember anything anybody said. The  acting is superfluous - I felt sorry for poor Matthew Broderick, as he is  quite obviously not supposed to be the star of the film, and I felt doubly  sorry for Jean Reno, who is so effortlessly cool that this just falls off  him like water off the back of a duck. Of special note is Maria Pitillo as  the love interest / spunky heroine - as a shrieking, whining harridan  you'll be wishing for her to be eaten from the moment you see her.<br />The  real star, Godzilla itself, is just a big blank slate - you neither feel  sorry for the poor beast, nor hate him. Whereas the Japanese version of the  monster was charming despite obviously being a man in a suit, here Godsie  is just a big effect.<br />As for the rest of it, what can be said? It rumbles  around for two hours, and when it's over you're left wondering what the  heck you were just watching. It isn't inept enough to be truly awful, it's  just horribly, totally competent.<br />On DVD there areextra bits - you'll  probably never watch them, as I should imagine you'll only get the DVD as a  Birthday gift from an ill-informed parent (for example).

0780622650|2.0|Along with 'Godzilla' this was something of a recent watershed - as a couple of the DVD-extras attest, this film is first and foremost a technical showcase. It's visually dazzling - virtually every shot features  some form of CGI effect, and the sets and costumes all reek of money. But,  and this is a big but, there isn't actually a film underneath it all.  Seeming like the first three episodes of a bad cartoon series, the film is  just a big, hollow mess, with a needlessly complex plot and surprisingly  little of the original show (which, come to think of it, isn't necessarily  a bad thing). Looking back, I can't think of a single line or situation  that stood out as being particularly dramatic, witty or memorable, except  perhaps Mimi Rogers' costume, and the gravelly,  twenty-five-cigarettes-a-day voice of the younger daughter, which surely  was also a special effect. On the other hand, it's likeable enough, and  chunters along without being too dull, and the cast, although they have  very little to do, is interesting. William Hurt is a 'proper' actor, and I  can't actually remember anything of any import that he did in this film,  apart from argue with Matt LeBlanc. Interestingly, at the second cinema in  which I saw this, the audience burst into laughter every time he appeared -  as with the rest of the 'Friends' he is so inextricably linked with his  character type that we won't let him do anything else. For the guys in the  audience Mimi Rogers is like your best friend's glamourous mother, Heather  Graham is Heather Graham, and the aforementioned vocally-afflicted Lacey  Chabert will make you feel slightly uneasy about fancying somebody so  young.
B00003CXFV|5.0|The movie was awesome.  It wasn't to dramatic and it was something you  could relate to real life situations.  It showed how a struggling single  mother would do anything to feed her babies and she wasn't going to take  nonsense from no one, not even her boss.  She struggled and landed herself  a job which would change her life forever. Julia Roberts played the part of  Erin will and really deserves an Oscar.
6305810109|5.0|Is it possible for David Lynch to direct a movie with a straight forward plot, no nudity, no violence, no foul language, and no dances into the surreal?   YES... and with much success!<br />Mr. Lynch, now that you've shown  us what you can do, please give us more movies like this, and fewer like  Lost Highway.
B00004TWSX|5.0|I didn't think that it was possible... but they acctually improved on Queen's A Night at the Opera. Undisputedly the greatest Queen album ever, it most definately deserves the coveted honor of being gold-plated. If  you're not a big queen fan, you could settle for the regular version. But  if you like Queen, this is for you!
B000009QPO|4.0|This is a simple album.  There's no odd starts &amp; stops, no odd meters, no impossible guitar riffs or jaw dropping drumming.  This is just fantastic, from the heart music.  Songs from the heart of America...its  what I imagine the Midwest sounds like.   Its got a little bit of twang and  some big guitars to go with it.  The duo of MarK Olson's acoustic guitar  and &amp; Gary Louris' electric guitar is a perfect songwriting match.   They also do a beautiful job harmonizing vocals.    This is one of those  albums that catches the essence of middle America.  Like I said, there's  nothing flashy here, but for whatever reason...it works.  Fans of the  Vigilantes of Love or 16 Horsepower would probably like these guys.  Its  just music from the heart with no bull!  <br />Recommended.
B00000DGUG|1.0|After selling 16 million copies of her debut album,this follow-up BOMBED big-time! The only single to make the charts,&quot;thank u&quot;,peaked at a paltry #17,and alternative radio dropped this mess faster than you can  say, Vanilla Ice. Proof,that her debut album's success,was INDEED,a fluke!  Most recently,Alanis relased an MTV unplugged special,and cd..The special  aired on MTV to poor ratings,and the companion cd bombed,peaking at at  #60... I haven't seen a rock artist go from  hot to cold this fast,since  Peter Frampton!
1558908374|4.0|A great movie for all the family! Strongly reminiscent of the cartoon version, this makes for one very enjoyable film. Glenn Close is simply stunning as Cruella. Whoever cast her is nothing less than a genius.  However, the movie does tend to be more slapstick than real genuine humour.
0694003611|5.0|I teach kindergarten and love to read children's stories.  My class of four and five year olds are always impatient and can't sit still long enough to listen to most stories.  However, they love this book.  The story  is engaging and the text is simple.  It's a wonderful book to read before  nap time.
B000003CKH|4.0|It can be a bad sign when my two favourite songs on an album are cover versions. That happens here. It usually means that the artist in question couldn't write a song to save their musical lives. Fortunately, the Cake boys manage to pull enough rabbits out of their funky hats to make the rest of the album a treat as well.<br />\\"I Will Survive\\" and \\"Sad Songs and Waltzes\\" (the aforementioned cover ditties) are two of the most soulful tracks ever put on record. The first wipes away any and all over-produced disco connotations by laying down a typically funky groove, and blanketing that with a very cool and talky vocal track that's phrased so far behind the beat it may as well be in the next song. The second is a beautifully sappy alterna-country masterpiece, that makes me teary every time I hear it.<br />The Cake originals are great too, Beatnik-Funk at its best.  Standouts for me are \\"Friend is a Four Letter Word\\", \\"Frank Sinatra\\", \\"The Distance\\", and \\"She'll Come Back to Me\\". All in all, it's a very easy on the ears and laid back record, that manages to crank up the juice in the amps, while being soulful and poignant at the same time.
0805047905|5.0|Brown Bear Brown Bear is a favorite story in my kindergarten class.  The children love the easy to remember text and the colorful pictures.  The story is excellent and the children especially love to hear this story  before nap time.  All of the Eric Carle books are wonderful and a must have  for any child.
B00004TL21|5.0|Atmosphere was the only thing The Deftones were missing with their two previous albums, Adrenaline and Around the Fur, but with White Pony's much deeper sound, they have created an album that is along the lines of Dark  Side of the Moon in it's greatness.<br />Mellower than their previous work,  but not as mellow as some people would lead you to believe. Elite  borderlines on psychotic, Korea is more frightening than any Limp Bizkit  song, and Street Carp and Pink Maggit are as energetic as anything The  Deftones have ever written. But the more brooding, slower songs are what  make this CD. The Deftone's DJ Frank Delgado adds a whole new element to  their sound, combined with Chino's haunting voice, Steph's oozing guitar  and Chi and Abe's flowing beats, White Pony is a few steps higher than your  typical hard-core album.<br />Heavy, quiet and trippy all at the same time.  Very heavy at times, but numbingly soft at others. If you liked the rawness  of Adrenaline, or the rhythmic tones of Around the Fur, buy all 3 versions.

B00003CWTI|2.0|When watching this movie, one thought kept running through my head, &quot;How did this get made?&quot;  It was a confusing tale that includes about thirty characters that are all loosely related to each other.  I was  too distracted by trying to keep the odd relationships straight to  concentrate on the pointless message of the movie, which seemed to be that  weird things happen in life.  Not the most fulfilling moral in the  world.<br />Tom Cruise's performance did not stand out from the others in the  movie.  I could not understand how he got nominated with the other fine  actors for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  All of the others had  outstanding performances in incredible movies, yet Cruise didn't do a whole  lot in this movie.<br />I don't have a problem with long movies.  I usually  appreciate a longer movie, but this could not hold my attention.  The story  bounced from character to character so quickly that I didn't have enough  time to care for any one of them.  So I got bored.  <br />This movie was an  incredible waste of an evening.  I have thoughts that I might like it  better after seeing it a second or third time, but I don't want to take  that risk!  I only have so much time to waste.  I definitely do not  recommend this film.
B00004TL21|4.0|Honestly, I can't get enough of the hidden track.. it kicks ass!
B00004TL21|5.0|I must admit that I have been waiting a long time for the new Deftones album to finally hit the shelves, but such anticipation for an album usually brings some kind of disappointment, given that you're usually  expecting too much from it. I'm happy to say that this album even exceeds  the expectations that I had of it. The Deftones really are on a level all  their own with &quot;The White Pony&quot;, and display a maturity and  complexity to their songs which is nothing short of outstanding. I was  fortunate enough to pick up one of the limited edition black copies, and  all of the songs are strong. While the usual power and dynamics of the  Deftones are fully intact, (Terry Date's production is first class once  again), it is some of the slower, deeper songs on this album that really  hit you the hardest. &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, &quot;RX Queen&quot;, and  the jaw-dropping &quot;Passenger&quot;, a collaboration with Maynard from  Tool are absolutely outstanding, while the gentle but moving  &quot;Teenager&quot; sounds almost like the Smashing Pumpkins at their most  poignant and fragile. If anything the band has moved into a more  atmospheric environment with their sound, and while not as immediately hard  hitting and raw as the two previous albums, it's slow burning and building  intensity will literally floor you after a few listens. It would be hard to  categorise any of the tracks as standouts simply because of the overall  strength of the album as a whole. With so much commercially produced fodder  flooding the market at the moment, where demographics and merchandising  seem to dictate the success of an artist, it is good to know that their are  still artists out there producing music with innovation, passion and  feeling. To this end, I think we all owe the Deftones our gratitude.
B00000DLVA|5.0|I have to admit, when I first heard it, I was very disappointed, and a bit dumbfounded. I sort of took this album as being a Massive Attack knock-off. <br />But recently, I decided to give it another chance. Now looking back, I  wonder how I could have ever made that mistake.<br />A lot of the Cardigans'  key elements are here in full, they're just not making the really sunny pop  music of their early work. Nina's voice is still in great form, and the  band behind her are really talented blokes.<br />People only familiar with the  harder driving than usual My Favorite Game will be surprised to hear the  rest of the album.<br />Erase/Rewind, Higher &amp; Junk of the Hearts are  probably my favorite songs, but everything here is really great.
0792101448|5.0|This is with out question the best western ever made.  At first when i saw it i did not think much of it but i saw it a few more times and it grew on me. This is a great work of art and one of the best 10 movies ever made.   It is also Henry Fonda's best performance.
B00004TL21|4.0|Before I begin, I must make it clear that I am an avid Deftones fan who has their two previous releases (Adrenaline &amp; Around the Fur), and has attended quite a few of their shows around the bay area and Los Angeles.  Deftones have been in my cd player more times than any other band I listen  to, and even after all this time I still listen to their  recordings.<br />White Pony has traces of their past, yet obviously innovates  the alt-metal genre.  These guys almost remind me of Helmet with their  experimental guitars and off-beat drums.  The other parts of the record are  clearly experimental, and while Chino Moreno is a great singer, I just  don't find any of the album (with the exception of the first 3 tracks,  which I already heard on the deftones website) to be as good as their  previous material.<br />In any case, there is a lot of interesting stuff on  this album that I am sure I will eventually get used to, but after the  first couple listens just didn't find anything too outstanding.
0767819594|5.0|I don't know what you negative-review people talk about! I have never seen Dangerous Liasions, but I really can't imagine as it was made a long time ago, that it is like THIS!. So why are you guys comparing these two movies  and just don't see them on their own? What I mean is that in the original  there are surely NO lesbians, NO homosexuals and certainly NO one saying :  That's an orgasm! You should see them on their own. Anyway, I don't know  much movies that make leave you sad, thinking and at the same time you are  laughing your a.. off!  The Plot itself is absolutely great and Sebastian's  change to a good guy is absolutely beliveable. The Actors absolutely  superb, just take Sarah Michelle Geller as the hot evil girl and Ryan  Phillipe as the most arrogant and ignorant person I have seen in a movie  for a long time. And if you compare his skills to Di Caprio: FORGET IT, HE  IS A REAL ACTOR THAT DOESN'T NEED A BUNCH OF TEEN GIRLS SCREAMING AFTER  HIM. I highly recommend this movie!
B00003Q43A|3.0|Let's face it...&quot;Independence Day&quot; is about as mindless an entertainment as you can get, but it IS entertainment, and it works beautifully on that level.<br />&quot;Independence Day&quot; is like a 1970's  disaster flick with $50 million in F/X. Things get blowed up real good  indeed...so good, in fact, that the movie loses a LOT of steam after things  stop getting blowed up. <br />Still, &quot;Independence Day&quot; is a lot of  fun, and features some funny performances (especially Will Smith, who  actually trash-talks one of the alien invaders as he drags him across the  desert). <br />But the point of this movie IS watching things get blowed up  real good.<br />And that it does well.
B000002MG1|5.0|Automatic For the People has got to be one of R.E.M.'s greatest works.  There is a great variety of songs on the album, from the upbeat &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;, to the wistful and inspiring  &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and the wonderfully outspoken  &quot;Ignoreland&quot;.  One of my personal favorites, however, is the last  track, entitled &quot;Find the River&quot;.  The words are beautifully  strung together and the instruments in the background sound great.  I would  definately recommend this album to anyone, R.E.M. fan or not.
0792833279|4.0|&quot;Get Shorty&quot; is a humdinger of a movie - smart, funny, and VERY full of itself...kinda like its &quot;hero&quot;, Chili Palmer.<br />Every character and performance hits all the right notes, starting with John  Travolta's right-on portrayal of Palmer, a loan shark who has tired of the  mob business and would like to try his hand at a REAL mob business: the  movies.<br />Palmer isn't a bad guy; he's just all business, which certain  characters (especially Ray Bones) should have figured out early on. But  they don't, and we get to see Chili eliminate his enemies one by one  through sheer guile and smarts. In particular, his payback on Bones is an  absolute classic.<br />One of the film's truly great pleasures is watching  great actors like Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito try to play Chili.  Hackman's performance gets him a very unwelcome audience with Bones  (&quot;I heard you shot the guy four times in the chest and once in the  foot&quot;), while DeVito's simply doesn't work, and by the end of the  movie Chili is looking to &quot;get&quot; someone other than  &quot;shorty&quot;.<br />Also look for James Gandolfini in his best pre-Tony  Soprano role as an ex-stuntman.
B000002B82|5.0|If for Blizzard of Oz, this would be Ozzy's best album by a considerable margin. No More Tears is Zakk Wylde's crowning moment and Ozzy's greatest lyrical effort. The title track is great. \\"Mama I'm  Coming Home\\" is a great song that people who believe Ozzy is Satanic (fools!) should hear. \\"Desire\\" is good, as is \\"Road to Nowhere.\\" \\"Zombie Stomp\\" is extremely underrated. This belongs in every collection.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Say what you will about Steven Spielberg, but a lesser filmmaker would have been far less gutsy about this film. <br />Can you imagine a film being made today about a killer shark...and having the filmmaker resolutely  refuse to show you the shark until the film was 2/3 done?<br />That's what  makes &quot;Jaws&quot; so effective - we don't know anything about the  shark at all. It's a complete mystery. That makes it a true protagonist in  a dramatic sense...and a great counterpoint to today's action films, in  which silly one-liners and overacting count as great villainy.<br />It shows  great faith in the intelligence of the moviegoer on Spielberg's  part.<br />&quot;Jaws&quot; has other charms as well. The performances are  excellent, especially Robert Shaw's turn as the crusty, slightly crazy and  ultimately very likeable Quint. The scene in which he describes his  experience with the sinking of the USS Indianapolis is absolutely  riveting.<br />The John Williams score is a classic, and it's a tribute to the  craft of the filmmakers that very few of the film's special effects  (including the shark) look the least bit dated today.<br />All in all, this is  a classic, but I don't need to tell you that...you've probably already seen  it a few dozen times yourself.

B00000ILBK|3.0|In terms of message, this may be the most ambitious Trek film of all time - Federation values versus expediency. In the end, Federation values (read: Captin Picard's values) prevail, but those values are so foreign to our  &quot;ends justify the means&quot; society that the resolution is vaguely  unsatisfying.<br />No wonder the 24th century society of Star Trek would  regard us as primitive...<br />No problem with the action and Vfx - it's all  first cabin stuff, though the Baku village set seems a little too much like  a singles club on some island somewhere.<br />Where the film falls down is in  its attempt to be humorous. Some of the gags (like Worf's pimple) work,  others (the whole &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot; scene) don't. It all seems too  forced, too calculated, and though the Trek cast (particular Brent Spiner)  is commendably skilled at comedy, they can't pull it off.<br />And leave it to  Captain Picard to have a romance so ethereal, so intellectual, that nothing  happens. Wouldn't you think that Picard would pursue Anja a little more  passionately given that his last romp in the sack was about five years  before?<br />Overall, though, &quot;Insurrection&quot; is worthwhile and is  quite entertaining, forced humor or not. And the series goes on...
B000000HHE|5.0|This is by far one of the most important hip-hop albums in creation because with De La's eclectic styles and true innovation, they triggered what would take hip-hop to the next level.  Even though the &quot;Daisy  Age&quot; aspect of their album had to clash with the more hardcore styles  of groups like Public Enemy and 3rd Bass, either way, their fun and  creativity won the hearts of hip-hop fans all around the world.  De La  Soul's music will always live forever through the hearts, minds, and souls  of many people who have listened to hip-hop music for years and to artists  now who have been inspired by them.  Their music will always be &quot;from  the soul.&quot;
B00004TL21|5.0|Everyone says that Chino was the man that created this album. It is true that Chino and Abe wrote the majority of this album, but it was a team effort. You can hear the influences of every member in this recording.  Especcially Franks. So, why is this album so good? Let me tell you, this  recording is totally original and could not have been created by any other  band besides the Deftones. Every song on this album has a good vibe to it  and gets all the emotions out of you.<br />It starts off very moody with an  old style Deftones track Feiticeira. Then kicks in with a soft very  emotional song, Digital Bath. After that comes Elite, the hardest track  they have ever wrote which picks up the pace of this album. From their on  its all uphill and amazing. Every song sounds different on this album.  That's why you can never get tired of it. I give it 5 stars because I have  never heard anything like it before in my life. It's a new Deftones sound,  or should I say sounds, but maybe their best recording yet.<br />A must buy  for any fan of Dredg, A Perfect Circle, Far, or Tool.
0441172717|4.0|Herbert's classic masterpiece &quot;Dune&quot; expertly interweaves a science fiction future world with socio-political and religious theory to construct a compelling, although sometimes confusing, novel. The telling of  the transformation of Paul Atriedes from young, innocent ducal heir to the  Kwisatz Haderach is engaging and at the same time, disturbing. We see him  both prepare for and fear the on-coming storm of the Muad'Dib jihad across  the universe. Taken by itself, this story seems lacking at the end, but it  must be read in concert with &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of  Dune&quot; to fully appreciate Herbert's efforts.
B00004RHZU|5.0|When I got this CD I was worried about all the songs sounding the same, but after I listened to it a few times, some of the songs sounded very similar, but they were all very cool. My favorite songs are probably &quot;Most Girls&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot; they  are both very cool songs. The only problem is, is that the copy that I got  has the 'bad' lyrics bleeped out. Especially on &quot;Can't  Take Me Home&quot; I was disappointed that they weren't there! Same with  &quot;There You Go&quot; there is one lyric that is bleeped out on that one  too, that's disappointing! So, if you like the first single, you will like  the album!
0525457585|5.0|Usually, I don't really like fantasy books. But &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; is not just a story, it is an ingenious literal masterpiece. Once you have this book in your hand, you simply cannot put it down - I've  read it in less than five hours. <br />What makes this book different from  other fantasy novels is the sense of realism in conveys. You can almost  feel yourself slipping into the world of Fantastica with Bastian, leaving  the grey boring real World behind...<br />The amazing thing is that &quot;the  Neverending Story&quot; is one of the most far-fetched, bizzare stories  I've ever encountered. But somehow, once you begin reading, you are willing  to set all your disbeliefs aside. <br />It could be just Ende's stroke of  genius, or perhaps there is still a bit of magic left in our World.

B00003CX9S|5.0|I have always had unusual fascinations, and Joseph Merrick is no exception. At the time The Elephant Man was released in 1980, I was but a mere second grader. I was enthralled by the mystery and spook factor of  such a stark and dreary film. Today, I am a film student/director. My films  are mostly in the style of David Lynch, David Fincher and Ridley Scott -  dark and eerie. The mood which low lighting creates is unsurpassed in its  ability to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Furthermore, the majority of the  stories I write and the films that I intend to make one day, all revolve  around persons whom have had to overcome seemingly insurmountable  struggles. While as a boy it was the esoteric 'creepiness' which interested  me, I look back upon such experiences as being instrumental in shaping me  artistically. I feel there is no better story to tell than that of people  who live in a world of intolerance and have the ability to create for  themselves a life despite their outcast status. My compliments to you as  well for dedicating yourself to such an endlessly interesting subject as  Joseph Merrick. His is a lesson to be relished not only from the  perspective of disabilities, but from one of self-respect, steadfastness  and determination; Very unique characteristics in a situation which might  daunt the average man. <br />The Elephant Man is one of the few examples of a  genuine masterpice. It encompasses all the necessary components required to  create a balanced and rythmic piece of work. The cinematography by Freddie  Francis renders a cold, hard world of poverty and strife in London of the  late 19th century. A mood which sets the stage in painting the portrait of  a man whose life was plagued tenfold on account of his ghastly deformation.  In a society where appearance was everything and pretense the norm, the  film's various themes include the fact that there always have been people  who were altruistic enough to go against the grain. In this I refer not  only to Joseph Merrick, but to Sir Frederick Treves and Dame Madge Kendall.  Two figures at the upper eschelon of Victorian society who did not permit  the trappings of wealth, beauty and power to control their need to bestow  kindness upon a person in dire circumstances. The music in this film is  perfectly calculated to complement the sadness surrounding a predicament  such as the shrouding Merrick. Other times the music boasts the lavish  entity which was Victorian society. And still at other moments, the sick  fascination of the lowly freakshow spectators crowd is demonstrated in the  ratchety strains of carnival  bells and whistles. In all, the performances  of the major and minor players in this film are beyond perfection. Not only  can they deliver the characters flawlessly, but it is obvious that the  ensemble of actors was carefully pondered and then pondered again until  coming up with the talent which could carry this monument of a film. The  Elephant Man has an uncanny ability to depict the exploited- this film  easily rivals Freaks.
630587493X|5.0|Unbelievable. I saw the previews and thought &quot;it's just another Chris Columbus movie&quot;. I didn't plan on seeing it. Then, a few days after it was released, I was talked into it by a friend and though &quot;well, it  won't be TOO bad. Robin Williams is always funny&quot;.   By the end of  this movie I was sobbing uncontrollably, uncaring of the packed theater  aroud me, unaware of anything else. And I'm a 18 year-old male who claims  FIGHT CLUB is his favorite movie! Overall, 3 scenes stand out in my mind as  making me sob like I did; The death of Sam Neil's character, the death of  'Little Miss', and finally the scene with Williams and his wife on their  death bed (which was the one during which I was sobbing uncontrollably).    This film was so incrediably moving that I still, even months and months  after it's release, am in awe of it. I really connected with William's  charater, I felt his burning desire to become human, to fit in, to  experience life and even death.    The acting was flawless in every  aspect, the music stirring and lyrical, the special effects, that while in  service to the story, were still breathtaking, the scope of the story being  told suprising. And all of it done without horrid language or violence.     See this movie. Ths is a mature Chris Columbus film, not the kiddie flick  depicted in the trailers. See it and see what it's like to truely be human.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Britney, Britney, Britney...what can I say.  A very appealing singer, but her personal charm isn't enough to make this album anything but a mediocre CD.  The largest problem with Oops...I Did It Again is that its a pop album  with some very un-popish songs.  Pop music isn't exactly known or expected  to be very deep and meaningful, its about creating infectious tunes and  basically just having fun with carefree music.  Songs like the title track  &quot;Oop!...I Did It Again&quot;, &quot;Stronger&quot;, and &quot;What U  See&quot; successfully accomplish these goals, enfusing fun lyrics with  fast powerful beats.  The rest of the album however range from average to  BLAH.  Some songs like &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot; are  sweet but don't really offer anything to set them apart from any other  run-of-the-mill ballad, others like &quot;Lucky&quot; are catchy but seem  almost ridiculous, while still other songs like &quot;Dear Diary&quot; are  just plain awful. Another problem with Ms. Spears' 2nd album is that there  really are no songs that convey a real feel or picture of who Britney is,  she seems to be on the outside of each song, like they don't have anything  to do with her. The most interesting part of the album could very well be  the little interludes in between some songs, featuring Britney and friends,  which are so ridiculous that I for one couldn't help but burst into wild  rages of laughter.
B000002J27|5.0|&quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; is sometimes overlooked because of its positioning in the album order.  Casual Phil &quot;pop&quot; fans of the  band might consider it too far back to have any foot-tapping value (which  it indeed is).  Likewise, fans looking to get into the &quot;old  stuff&quot; might immediately go for &quot;Trick's&quot; immediate  predecessor, &quot;The Lamb&quot; (also brilliant).  However, if you're  looking to make a first purchase into the catalog of older and more  elaborate Genesis, you might find &quot;The Lamb&quot; a bit hard to  take.<br />In many ways, &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; is a much more  timeless album than &quot;The Lamb Lies Down&quot; (incidently, the latter  is my favorite album): &quot;Trick's&quot; production if far, far better  than that of &quot;The Lamb.&quot;  The sound quality is so far superior  that a good many, if not all, of the songs on &quot;Trick&quot; sound as if  they could be released today, while many tracks on &quot;The Lamb&quot;  seem stuck in the '70's.  This timelessness is enhanced by Mr. Banks'  choice of using a good old-fashioned piano rather than those sometimes  annoying '70's synths on a few of the best songs on here, including  &quot;Mad Man Moon,&quot; &quot;Ripples,&quot; and the title track.   Indeed, the simplistic piano melody that accompanies &quot;Mad Man  Moon&quot; is nothing less than (dare I say it?) a master stroke of genius  on the part of Genesis' highly underrated keyboard player.<br />My one true  complaint of this album--WHERE'S STEVE?????  Jeez, no wonder he left the  band!  And genius though Tony Banks may be, he might have let Mr. Hackett  get A BIT more of his writing through.  Having said that, Steve does  present some of his most intriguing material here.  &quot;Entangled&quot;  may be the best song he ever wrote; coupled with &quot;Blood on the  Rooftops&quot; from Wind and Wuthering, it represents one of the two best  works Steve Hackett wrote for the band.  A brief but satisfying Hackett  solo also appears in Banks' &quot;Ripples,&quot; and some of his writing  shows up in the albums' recurring-theme suite of &quot;Dance on a  Volcano,&quot; &quot;Squonk,&quot; and &quot;Los Endos.&quot;  <br />Peter  Gabriel may be gone, but the magic lives on in &quot;A Trick of the  Tail.&quot;  This may indeed be a prime candidate for Genesis' best album  if accessibility were to become a major factor in the grading.  That is not  to say, however, that this album does not fall more along the lines of  &quot;Cerebral Rock&quot; than mere pop rock.

0441172717|5.0|What can be written about this book that hasn't made its way into a critical essay, somewhere?  The thing I find truly remarkable about this work is how it stands up to the tests of time and repeated reevaluation.   Like the protagonist of this story, the author seems to have had a certain  amount of clarivoyance.  This book bears repeated reexamination and  discussion, and will until the current year and the books year coincide  (around 10,000 AD or so, I think...)  On a personal note, I find the idea  of the best warriors in the universe using primarily blades, not guns, to  be an interesting futuristic anachronism.  Not to mention very cool.
B000000W5N|4.0|Compared with the numerous other thousands of albums out there Sticky Fingers does very, very, well. <br />Since most people only write about the stuff they really love some of the album ratings (surprise) get artificially inflated.<br />I believe that this is one of the albums that  don't.<br />In response to all of the Stones/Beatles bashing that goes on  around here I would like to point out     that it is useless to compare the  two. What the Beatles lack in blues and soul, the Stones make up tenfold.  What the Stones lack in experimentation, the Beatles make up tenfold.<br />It  is possible that some people are missing out on some great stuff because of  a lack of musical scope. So if you hate the Rolling Stones, buy Sticky  Fingers. If you hate the Beatles, get the White Album. Both of them are  filled with some great material. Don't blindly choose sides on a rivalry  that began more than 30 years ago.
6300216268|4.0|Harold and Maude is a dark comedy about a young man and his friendship with a 79-year-old woman. Harold is obsessed with death and enjoys going to funerals of strangers, which is where he meets Maude, an eccentric old  woman. Maude teaches Harold about love and enjoying life. The movie is very  funny and touching and the great soundtrack is supplied by Cat Stevens.
0385484518|5.0|This wonderful book focuses on the meaning of life, from the perspective of a teacher (Morrie Schwartz) who is about to lose his life and his pupil, (Mitch Albom) who has lost his focus on what is important.  They come  together for 14 Tuesdays (just like they did while the author was a college  student at Brandeis) before the professor passes away of ALS (Lou Gehrig's  disease).<br />This book is filed with the most beautiful sayings you can  imagine.  Here are a few examples:  'Giving to other people is what makes  us feel alive.'  'Love each other or perish.'  'Everybody knows they are  going to die, but nobody believes it.  If we did, we would do things  differently.'  'Learn to detach from experience.' <br />Many people would  avoid a book on this subject, because they do not want to think about  death.  Although Morrie Schwartz is dying throughout this book, the subject  is really about living rather than dying.  Few will find the dying to be  distressing, even though it is graphically and frequently addressed.<br />For  those of us with many years to live, this book can be a wake-up call to  start really living now -- in the ways we would if we were about to die, as  well as to learn how to treat others while we still have them with us.  For  those who have but little time left, this book can be an inspiration for  how to get the most out of the remaining time.<br />You will probably find it  heart-warming (as I did) to find out that the advance on this book was paid  in time to help defray some of Professor Schwartz's medical expenses.   <br />May you find new meaning in your life from reading this wonderful book!   Life is a teacher, and Morrie Schwartz's thoughts can be a text to help you  understand the lessons.
B00004TL21|4.0|I believe the Deftone are truly a gift to us music fans.  Not only do they move us to pure extascy they make us really listen closely to one of the most captivating voices in music today.  The Deftones are uncomparable to  anyone, their sound, grove and the incrediable feeling that makes one feel  like putting their fist through the dash of your car, overpowers us. It  makes us want to keep buying the albums and listen for hours, because of  the the way they create every album with precision.  Each album after  another heavy or not their music is awesome, for instance &quot;Digital  Girl&quot; cries pure artistry, it makes &quot;Bored&quot; boring, in some  eyes.  Yes, the album is a bit slower then the other two, but same would be  boring and we don't need another &quot;Off Spring&quot;. Get the album its  worth it, its fine machines working hard.
B000006E4C|5.0|When you mention minimalist music, a lot of people  close their minds, anticipating dull, repetitive, emotionless sounds (read: Phillip Glass).  That is not the case with this piece, nor with any other Reich composition  that I've heard.  I was exposed to \\"Music for 18 Musicians\\" for  the first time several years ago, when I was in college, and my attitude  toward minimalism was forever changed.  You can listen to this in a couple  of ways: just sit and let it wash over you, or focus on the rhythms, the  continual building of phrases, the patterns, the layers of patterns, and  the greater patterns created by the layers.  It is an astonishing work, and  I was privileged enough to see it performed live a few nights ago, by Reich  and his colleagues.  The musicians frequently move around the stage, taking  over for each other, I assume to avoid exhaustion, but it becomes an  astonishing dance and display of teamwork.  They received a standing  ovation and three curtain calls.  My mother loved it, and she's 79!  If  your mind is open to new things, and you appreciate the emotional impact of  music, listen to this.
B00004TL21|4.0|Ive been wating 2 years for this cd to come out and im glad it did.Passenger is my favorite song on it becausse it has Tools Maynard james keenen on it.Most of the songs on it are really good but it is different  from deftones other albums though.It is softer and has some electronic  stuff.Some of the songs are heavey though.Listen to sound clips before you  by it.It is a great album though.
014028009X|4.0|Bridget Jones is funny, upbeat, and one of the truer characters I've met in a while.  Her struggles and problems are honest and are what face almost any woman: single, married, or otherwise.  While the humor is the definite  driving factor of the novel, the underlying story - that all you need is a  little spunk, self-forgiveness, and a resilient spirit - really makes the  book worthwhile. I'd recommend it to anyone!
0783117388|5.0|I love the shows on video!  It allows me to watch the first season over  and over again.  Bring on season 2!  I'll be waiting!
6305627347|5.0|This is my new favorite movie. It all starts when the 4 kids go into an R-rated movie. They emerge spouting 4lettered words they learned from it. Upon hearing these words from their children, The mothers start a clan to get rid of foul language at the source... Canada. With subplots such as The  execution of Terrance &amp; Phillip, Kenny getting burned to death, going  to hell, finding Satan and his gay lover, the late Saddam Housein, who are  going to rule earth when Canadians Terrance and Phillip's blood touches  American soil. Funniest thing youll ever see. Buy it and you'll never go a  day without wanting to watch it. Yet I warn you, not for the weak of heart  or the easily offended
B000031WD9|4.0|The movie isn't all that, but it is a good, clean (except for the penis in the pie segment) fun. Why do we think this is such a good comedy when in reality it is probably more hype than reality? Well, not only does it touch  a very touchy subject (finally!), but it has been a while since we have  seen a good comedy. With Jim Carrey dedicating hiumself to dramas Truman  Show and Man on the Moon, there really was little good comedy out there.  American Pie, yummy!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Captivating. This is a genius in totality of the word. Her sounds, rhythms, lyrics, raspy wisp of a voice pour and penetrate the realms of the emotional universe. More experimental than her brutal ballad debut Tidal  but just as amazing. Apple as proven herself a brilliant musician. She is  the brain of quiet rage. Songs like On the Bound, Limp, Get Gone, and Fast  As You Can grow more spectacular with every listen. A theatre of pain,  love, and blood. She definitely defines New Age.
B00000ADG2|5.0|You love rap. You love jazz. You love R&amp;B. You love rock. You love classical. Lauren's cd appeals to many cultures and generations. Her sounds are of pure style and class. Her lyrics are inspirational, thoughtful, and compliment the music in the grandest way. An amazing recording. It really  doesn't get much better than this.... Her lyrics are genuine, her talent is true, and hopefully, everlasting.
6305268843|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It is cast so well and the story is so intriguing.  I found the movie to be beautifully and thoughtfully made.  The only thing I don't understand is the R rating...there are a few mild  sex scenes and one occurrence of the &quot;F&quot; word (mild by today's  standards, to say the least).  If you like romantic movies, add this one to  your collection!
B000003TB6|5.0|This album is truly a work of art. I have all but one Roots album(the live one). This album is my favorite one. I felt that the production was so on point that it made me feel as if I were at a concert with them performing  especially in Essaywhuman!  Black Thought and Malik B's lyrics were very  intelligent, and they flow right along with the beats. My favorite tracks  are &quot;Silent Treatment,&quot; &quot;Proceed,&quot; &quot;Dat  Skat,&quot; &quot;Swept Away,&quot; and &quot;Do You Want More.&quot; I  even liked the freestyle joint with Dice Raw who rarely makes an appearance  on the Roots' three lp's before the live album and after  &quot;Organix.&quot; If you are a true hip hop and jazz fan, then go and  get this album. It is probably one of the most slept on albums in hip hop  history.
6305263248|5.0|I thought this an excellent movie. It isn't like most action movies where  the action is fake and just unrealistic. This is a story I can actually  believe, the violence is real, the acting isn't overdone but real. The  chases were awesome. I really enjoyed this movie and recomend it to anyone  sick of the fake overacted movies now a days.
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made.  The acting is incredible, the characters are great, and the story is gripping.  Tim Robbins, who plays the main character, Andy Dufresne, does an incredible  job.  He plays the heroic role of Andy to perfection, gaining the  audience's sympathy and respect, while capturing their hearts with every  step his character takes.  While Robbins is great, though, Morgan Freeman  is the one who steals the show in my eyes.  His narration adds a lot to the  movie, as does his overall portrayal of Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding.  To think that  he didn't win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor is truly mind-boggling.   Together, Freeman and Robbins have incredible chemistry, and make for one  of the best on-screen duos in recent memory.<br />The story is a great one.   Without giving anything away, I will only say that although this is a  rather lengthy movie (bordering on 2 and a half hours), it is time well  spent.  There are highs and there are lows; there are offensive points,  such as excessive swearing and sexual innuendos, but nothing in the movie  is done without purpose.  As Freeman's character puts it during the movie,  \\"prison is no fairy tale.\\"  When you watch this one to the end, you'll have  an appreciation for the realism that was presented within the film.<br />This  movie isn't just for those who enjoy prison movies; almost everyone who  sees this movie will have an appreciation for it on some level.  The  Shawshank Redemption is a great one, folks; the fact that it didn't win  Best Picture at the Oscars is truly a shame.  If you have managed to avoid  watching this one so far, don't put it off for another day.  Rent it  immediately, give it a watch, and I think that you'll find it difficult to  resist buying it.<br />I would also recommend buying the DVD of this movie if  you have a player to accomodate it.  It is admittedly short on features,  but the picture is incredibly crisp and clear, and the sound comes through  brilliantly.  Don't shy away from buying this one unless excessive features  are a must for you.
630469797X|5.0|When George Romero collaborated with my all time favorite director Dario Argento, he created the best zombie movie ever (next to Night of the Living Dead)!  I don't understand how Josh Leman could descrate this movie so much  in his review.  Pac-Man music!  That was the work of GOBLIN...the all  mighty quartet that produced the striking music for the majority of  Argento's flicks and influenced many, many other scores...such as  Halloween.  Pac-Man music? Sure the makeup is shody, the acting is bad, and  the movie is long.  But any true horror fan will see the films true merits.   Yes, there is a LOT of bloodletting, but what do you expect from a Romero  zombie flick?  How could someone who watches this type of film be offended  when they know what they're in for?  This film moves very quickly and is  action packed from beginning to end.  And unlike many other films, this one  even offers soical commentary.  It is not just about a bunch of people  stuck in a mall fending off zombies.  It's about human materialism...notice  the mall setting and the assertion that the zombies are coming back to a  place they loved in their former life...its about man's inablity to coexist  peacefully and our hunger for control...as when the bikers try to take over  the mall...and finally it foreshadows how mankind will utlimately wipe...or  eat..each other out with conflict.  Lets not forget the extremely vivid  gore and edge of your seat action.  HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!
B000002N2P|5.0|I'm surprised that INSOMNIAC is probably Green Day's most commercially disappointing album thus far.  The guitars and attitude on this are stronger and heavier than those on DOOKIE, NIMROD, or their earlier  releases.  Armstrong and company play with no mercy from start to finish,  and their loser-attitude lyrics almost seem believeable at times.  Some of  the tracks like &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot; and &quot;Geek Stink  Breath&quot; became hits on radio and MTV for good reason, but there's  really no filler at all.  &quot;86&quot; and &quot;No Pride&quot; have  probably never been heard by most people, but they contain the energy and  three-chord power that make Green Day so important to the genre they're at  the forefront of.  &quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot; is unique in that it's a  punk rock epic, something not usually a part of thirty minute records, and  shows Green Day can do more than just create two and three minute  explosions that sometimes end too quickly.  It's too bad MTV and other  music stations no longer play the videos from the hits on INSOMNIAC because  &quot;Geek Stink Breath,&quot; &quot;Brain Stew/Jaded,&quot; and  &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot; contain sick and laughable scenes that  only add to each song's explosiveness.  Anyone who's a fan of Green Day  needs this record, and it can also be said that those enjoying heavy metal  or grunge rock bands like Creed and Godsmack will also be surprised that  INSOMNIAC rocks harder than those bands do at many instances here.  I'm  definitely looking forward to the release of WARNING that I'm sure will  only further solidify Green Day's status as one of America's most important  rock bands.
1573226521|4.0|The closest thing we've got to The Great Backpacker Novel.<br />Garland really knows the backpacker culture about which he writes.  It's an amusing, well-written tale of the Lonely Planet traveler's dream-come-true.   The film tried, but could not interpret the style of the book, which is  half the fun.  <br />No laugh-out-loud hilarity, but a very amusing and  original read.  Unless you saw the film first, you wouldn't be able to  guess the end.<br />Great gift for that friend or relative who likes to  'travel rough.'
B00004T9UF|5.0|I bought this CD, and listened to every track on it. His lyrics are like no other because they hit close to real life. This is not a fictional collection of songs slapped together, they create a sense of realism.  Arguably, &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; is the best song on this CD.  &quot;Stan&quot; is another song that I liked as well. I like all the songs  on this CD not because I am on the Slim Shady band-wagon, but for the truth  mixed within the tracks. Great CD, nice work Eminem!
B00003CWOL|4.0|I had not heard of this movie before one day seeing it in the video store. On a whim and having previously viewed &quot;clerks&quot; and &quot;Mallrats&quot; I gave it a chance. I was hooked at the begining.  The  biting satirical outlook on religion was refreshing and is definetly a must  see.  The language is a bit harsh however the movie hits home with its  views toward the belief in god is more powerfull than religious doctrine.   This star studded movie is definetly the sleeper rental and for those that  prefer the status quo wake up and smell the 90's.
B00004THAY|4.0|This is a great blues record by two of the premier bluesguitarists. Its always good to have Clapton return to the blues modeas that usually where his best playing is found. B.B. is great as always. I dock this cd 1 star only because Warner has released it as an $ list. Forget gasoline prices, this is the type of price gouging Congress should investigate.
B00003CXB6|1.0|A pointless waste of time in which men with large guns are chased by terrifying creatures and NEVER manage to fire a shot at one.  Not even worth the laughs.  Disappointing in that so few of the annoying main  characters are eaten.  I kept hoping beyond hope that they would all be  consumed for stupidity.
B00004THAY|5.0|&quot;Riding With The King&quot; is a cool trip down the exhilarating highway of style and mood and atmosphere. Here we have a fantastic collaboration between two great artists. The songs are full of style,  richness and sometimes maybe even a little touch of dark comedy. The first  track, &quot;Riding With The King,&quot; is a pure delight, all style and  cool energy and lots of fun too. Other songs like &quot;Ten Long  Years&quot; and &quot;Three O'Clock Blues&quot; are nice atmospheric pieces  and you're surprised at how well B.B. King's and Eric Clapton's vocals  sound together in a song. And then there's the richness in the detail of  the music. You never get tired of hearing how King bends the strings in  that unique fashion as well as Clapton. This is an album full of talent and  style, one of the year's best releases.
B00000I7AJ|5.0|This is definitely a great Iced Earth album. You get everything: acoustics, galloping riffs, awesome drumming, solid bass lines, and the best vocals metal has to offer. Superb American power metal!  Call it  thrash, call it speed metal; this album is awesome, not their best but.....
B00003W8NM|1.0|That &quot;thought-provoking&quot; mantra of 98% customer's reviews is very yawn-provoking. Do you really need to see the guys beaten into the bloody pulp to start the thinking process?<br />What has prepared Mr. Fincher  for his &quot;penetrating&quot; look at the modern society? Making music  videos for Aerosmith, Madonna and - Oh my God! - Paula Abdul?  Shooting  commercials?<br />I find it impossible to relate to any character, act or  emotion in that film. It seems that for the director and the movie's fans  only 2 alternatives exist - total boredom or extatic frenzy. You are either  a mindless consumer or a fierce destructor. Nothing in between?<br />Ever  heard of contemplation, meditation, elation? Ever saw happy and content  people living their meaningful lifes? I do not mean the populace of Nora  Efron's idiotic paradise but real people living all around. Why is that  fascinationn with marginals?<br />The film starts with the main character's  complaining. Let me translate it for you. - I am obsessed with that  condominium! - In human language it means - I love my home so much! - <br />-  I leaf through IKEA catalogue ad nauseam.- It means: - I like IKEA's style  - it's affordable, sensible and contemporary.- <br />- All the contacts in  planes and tranes are brief, one-time.-  - So what? Some of these episodes  are little gems that would be spoiled by prolongation. What do you want? To  follow the guy you've spent a couple hours sitting next to to his home,  meet his family, stay for a week, see the photos, take his grandma to the  park?<br />There are less infantile ways of seeing the world , dealing with  the problems and letting the steam off. Want to kick and punch - go to a  local dojo. It will take you years to learn the right moves.<br />What is so  charismatic about Brad Pitt's pissing-in-a-soup character? Do you giggle  mischeviously seeing him insert a gigantic penis in a kiddie cartoon? That  is nothing else but the result of postponed adulthood of the pisser and the  gigglers.<br />Do you fall for Helena Bonham Carter's heroine - the  psyched-out punk with a small Neanthertaloid face and Halloween hairstyle?  Want to share a room with her and listen to that - Hear me die...- creaking  on a daily basis?<br />You can argue that watching a movie about Hitler you do  not necessarily enjoy what he is doing. But I've never seen Hitler played  by a stud icon. Fight Club guides you where the real excitement is. The  life outside is portrayed as a pitiful parody.<br />What we see is a hellpless  dualism, the love/hate relationship with consumerism. They either wallow in  that or smash their head against that. No one is trying to use it  reasonably, to enjoy the benefits. No one is strong and wise enough to be  above - they either submit or attack.<br />And the touch of conspiracy theory  is added, the much-loved urban paranoia. No one wants to be alone in a big  city, to accept the fact that the world around is mostly indifferent. So  the notion of a club - however weird - is very appealing. And I am sure the  film's fans consider themselves a club of a sort, the union of cool  guys.<br />One of the funniest things is the club's franchising at it's  branding stage. When I see these chemical burn marks on the hands of the  initiated I imagine Tylor going through that eye-to-eye routine hundred  times: - Only when you are at the threshold...blah-blah-blah...you can not  stop the pain...blah-blah-blah...- then the guy drops and he is all  yours.<br />The film has nothing to tell. All that contrieved pretentious  nonsense is laughable in it's efforts to &quot;tell the truth&quot;.  Millions of dollars were spent to glamorize the freaks doing their freaky  stuff and now the studio wants it's money back with the profit.<br />Are you  willing to contribute your time and cash? Better buy something useful from  IKEA.
0140430350|5.0|William Makepeace Thackeray subtitled &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, his masterful comic novel, &quot;A Novel Without a Hero&quot;. But while this big, baggy eight-hundred page monstrosity of comic characters and  situations may lack a hero, it has two of the most memorable characters in  English literature: Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp. The contrapuntal,  shifting fortunes of these two women drive the narrative of this big book,  painting, along the way, a brilliant satirical portrait of English and  European society at the time of the Napoleonic wars. We first meet Amelia  and Becky in the opening pages of the novel, leaving Miss Pinkerton's  School for the wider world of fortune, love and marriage. Amelia Sedley,  the naive, sheltered daughter of a rich London merchant whose fortunes will  dramatically change over the course of her life, &quot;was a dear little  creature; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in novels, which (the  latter especially) abound in villains of the most sombre sort, that we are  to have for a constant companion so guileless and good-natured a  person.&quot; In contrast, Becky Sharp, the impoverished orphan of an  artist and a French opera singer of dubious repute, was a calculating,  amoral social climber. &quot;Miss Rebecca was not, then, in the least kind  or placable . . . but she had the dismal precocity of poverty.&quot; From  the opening pages, Thackeray captures the reader's interest in these two  characters and carries the reader through marriages, births, deaths,  poverty, misfortune, social climbing . . . even the Battle of Waterloo!  While Amelia and Becky wind like a long, contrasting thread from the  beginning to the end of this story, there are also plots and subplots,  intrigues and authorial asides, and one character after another, all of  this literary invention keeping the reader incessantly preoccupied and  enthralled. Reading &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is the furthest thing from  &quot;killing time&quot; (as the dusty,misguided literary critic F. R.  Leavis once said); it is, rather, the epitome of the nineteenth century  English comic novel, a masterpiece in every sense of the word.
B000002KLQ|4.0|&quot;To everything, turn, turn, turn... There is a season, turn, turn, turn... And a time to every purpose under heaven&quot;<br />-- McGuinn and McGuire of the Byrds, courtesy of King Solomon.<br />As someone who was once a  twenty-two year old in 1980, I feel justified to write:  There comes a time  in one's early to mid twenties when one realizes that the idea of perfect  love is a goner.  Yet, there is still enough idealism tracking through the  veins that one holds out a hope, against the increasing body of evidence  being presented by worldly experiences.  A hope of imperfect yet satisfying  love.  One part Hallmark and one part Tennessee Williams.<br />Such did  &quot;Making Movies&quot; strike me when I first heard it, and continues to  resonate today.<br />In your twenties, every crush/romance is filled with  drama and you remember details forever.  &quot;Movies&quot; is filled with  details, both of the Polaroid and diary kind, with a narrative from a  protagonist who's all but admitted the thrill is gone (now having seen the  sins of ones formerly worshipped) yet still willing to give love a whirl --  be it the carnival (&quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;), the stage (&quot;Romeo and  Juliet'), the street (&quot;Skateaway, and to a lesser extent, &quot;Solid  Rock&quot; -- or should those be reversed? ), or even (whoa, was Mark way  ahead of his time foretelling the Starbucks craze?) the coffee shop  (&quot;Expresso Love&quot;).<br />And the album really tries to reconcile  previously held views (the all-you-need-is-love pot parties) with the  then-emerging didactic of the punks...&quot;love will get you like a case  of anthrax.&quot;  So said the Gang of Four, also in 1980.<br />It's a  commendable and heroic thing the Straits chose to do, making this album in  the midst of a huge sea change in rock music.  A testament, basically, to  the ongoing mystery of girls and boys, chicks and dudes, women and  men...and a suggestion that every one of our lives could most likely be  made into a movie -- probably a pretty good movie -- if Hollywood ever came  to its senses and started really making movies about real lives.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|I loved the movie when it first came out. It also has sentimental value for me brcause I took my wife to be to see it the first time.  And unlike some others I liked Burt Bacharach's sound track.  In 1969 it was  interesting to hear more modern tunes applied to a western. The most  positive aspect of this DVD however is it's example of how to produce a  DVD.  The quality of the remaster is excellent.  It's not just a simple  transfer from film.  The sound is very good considering the quality of the  original.  Remember this was the late 60's.  The extras, like the  interviews and trailers are fun to watch.  The best is &quot;The Making of  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.&quot;  I saw this extra feature on TV  prior to seeing the movie.  It was interesting to hear why the sepia tones  were used and how the final scene was shot.  It's too bad all DVD's don't  have these added features.
0553296981|5.0|This diary is eloquently written.  It is obvious that Anne Frank is profoundly talented.  It is an awful tragedy that such talent would perish as she did.  However, she did complain an awful lot.  I do understand that  she was going through what all adolescents go through.  I think if she had  known how bad the concentration camps were, she would have been more  appreciative of the little things she had in the annex.  This is an  excellent book!  Go out and read it today.
B000006OS2|1.0|As reported in many other reviews the quality of the DVD from Goodtimes is very poor. Many of the scenes appear washed out and the sound is so bad it detracts from the movie.  It was obviously made from a well used copy of  the film.  There are many scratches and dust spots.  On top of it all the  physical condition of the disk is poor.  When first played my DVD player  indicated the disk was scratched or dirty.  I tried cleaning it but it is  still having problems.  It seems a shame to waste the time and effort to  produce such a poor quality product when a good copy could have been made.   Hopefully a good version will be released soon.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Nothing as it seems. I bought this alblum thinking it would be like Vs. or Last Kiss (single) the only bright spot of this alblum is nothing as it seems, which is an incredible song, about as good as Daughter or Last Kiss.   I'd give it 21/2 stars.  Buy the single for Nothing as it seems if you  want a good song/value
B00004TL21|4.0|Definately more atmospheric than the last Deftones albums, I'd say it's better than Around the Fur, but maybe not quite as good as Adrenaline. It has some definate Tool elements to it, kinda slow and lethargic.  Nevertheless, there's some old Deftones agro in it as well. Overall a good  album.
B0000060NF|5.0|As a former night club DJ in the 70's I've collected thousands of albums &amp; CD's over the past 30 years, and &quot;What's Going On&quot; ranks right at the top of them all, and sounds just as fresh in 2000 as it did  during my senior year in high school in 1971!  Even more so than Stevie  Wonder's &quot;Innervisions&quot;, E,W &amp;F's &quot;That's the Way of the  World&quot;, Maze's &quot;Live in New Orleans&quot; and Parliament's  &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; Marvin set the bar at a level where few  have been, and where we can only wish music could ever ascend to again.   What a refreshing feeling every time I hear that opening sax melody on the  title track!  I won't go on and on about each individual song, since the  previous critics have said it well enough.  I'll just close by saying that  all aspiring R &amp; B musicians and singers should be required to take a  course called &quot;What's Going On - 101&quot; to learn how in incoporate  real voices and real instruments with revelant messages that will leave the  listener with the feeling that not only can life be better, but that maybe  we can go out and say something to encourage our brothers &amp; sisters to  make their lives better too!
B000023X9W|5.0|My first impression was that I loved &quot;Silver an Gold&quot;  Nevertheless, I thought the pleasure might fade after a few listens.  It didn't.  This is easilly a strong candidate for album of the year.  Neil  has not written such a consistent batch of great songs since &quot;Ragged  Glory.&quot;  Sure, they are mellow, but they have substance.  You'll swear  its 1972 again until you hear Neil sing &quot;my software's not compatible  with you,&quot; on the elegant closing track.  My only complaint?  at 38  minutes, it is way too short.  Oh well, it is still a masterpiece.
B00000K19E|2.0|With rare exception (&quot;Parenthood,&quot; &quot;Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot;), Keanu Reeves is a detriment to every film he appears in.  We've all seen him destroy great films like &quot;Devil's  Advocate&quot; and &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula.&quot;  This time, Keanu,  don't feel bad, it wasn't you.  The script in this film stinks!  In a  strange attempt to tell the story of Jesus Christ through a futuristic  sci-fi film (doesn't sound like a bad idea, right?) this picture only  manages to showcase the latest in CGI effects. I must mention, however, the  one reason I gave this picture 2 stars instead of one:  Hugo Weaver is  brilliant as Agent Smith!  He is also fortunate to have the only good lines  in the film when Smith is telling Neo what he thinks of the human race and  our world.  What other movies has Weaver been in?
B00004TL21|4.0|Well, here's another great album by the Deftones. Bout time, too. Chino's vocal skills are still incredible. Don't try to compare them to any bands out there today, because you can't. They stand alone, and for a good  reason. The blend of slow songs like &quot;Digital Bath&quot; and  &quot;Change&quot;, as well as faster ones like &quot;Elite&quot; was more  than enough to keep me happy. Put White Pony on your must-have list, and  you won't regret it. Trust me.
0800177177|3.0|It's amazing that Keanu Reeves continues to be cast in otherwise great films.  This picture, along with &quot;Devil's Advocate&quot;, is another great picture that needs an actor like Johnny Depp in the lead role.  Reeves' wooden delivey of his dialogue makes this film almost unbearable  and, like &quot;Advocate&quot;, is carried entirely by a masterful director  and a powerhouse supporting actor (Oldman/Pacino).  The casting of Reeves  in movies such as &quot;Speed&quot; or &quot;The Matrix&quot; I don't find  so bothersome since they could only be slightly better without him, but it  really angers me to see a good film entirely destroyed like this. If you  want to see Keanu Reeves at his best, see &quot;Parenthood&quot; where he  sticks pretty close to his &quot;Bill &amp; Ted's&quot; character, which  seems to be what he does best.
B00003652Q|5.0|Well what can I say about this album? &quot;Script For A Jesters Tear&quot; is quite simply Marillon's finest hour. And my fave track has to be &quot;He Know's You Know&quot;,the promo video to this track is excellent too! The best way to listen to this album is in a dark room on a pair of earphones! Go find it!
6304428928|5.0|'Rain Man' is the kind of film where we know we are watching a formula movie, but we are so enraptured by the story and the premise and captivated by the brilliant performances by Cruise and Hoffman that we can't help but  let ourselves go and fully enjoy what this unique film has to offer. It  wouldn't of been so successful if Hoffman and Cruise hadn't delivered such  brilliant performances, their scenes together are masterful and we really  believe that they could be brothers, this also helps at boosting the  emotional impact near the end of the film. Taut direction by Levinson and a  well written screenplay also helps. But the element that leaves the  emotional impact is the relationship between Cruise and Hoffman, one of the  most popular brother relationships in film history, also Hoffman created an  instant American icon; stuttering, autistic Raymond Babitt (Rain Man). From  a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!
0316777722|5.0|Buy this book. David Sadaris is incredible! This book is really a collection of anecdotes written by a man who is tentaively going to say what he thinks. And he does so in such a hilarious way that you will quake  with laughter. The best part of the book is when he talks about his  experiences in Paris. It is really funny. And Sadaris has the uncanny  ability to make you feel what he is going through. Another highlight of  this book is that he gives a totally new view of things. He  attacks<br />computers and modern life. But in a way that we can all  understand with total sympathy. This is really a great book. Buy it as soon  as possible and enjoy.
B00004THAY|4.0|When I was a kid, my grandmother used to play BB King 8-tracks (YIKES) in the car and I HATED it! She would say, &quot;boy, don't you know you're ridin' with the King?&quot; When this CD was released I just sat and  LAUGHED thinking back to 20 years ago when she'd say that. This CD was well  done. An All-star effort, with the production values to match. The KING on  the right, SLOWHAND on the left - this CD was meant to be enjoyed. The  blues flavor has once again been enhanced by the 2 of the best! Here's to  these two getting their just due when the Grammy's roll around. As for  grandma...well she's gone now, but I'm SURE she knows that I am  enjoying...RIDIN' WITH THE KING!
B00004TL21|5.0|You will not be disappointed in The White Pony, Deftones fans! I know many people have already heard it, due to the leak on the Internet, but please, buy the album for everything it entails. It definitely has a different feel  to it than the other two, much more mellow in comparison. Don't get me  wrong, they still know how to kick a$$, but Chino and the gang seem to be  turning a new leaf, showing us the softer side with songs like  &quot;Teenager,&quot; and even &quot;Pink Maggit.&quot; &quot;Digital  Bath&quot; is probably my favorite, how does Chino hit those notes!  And  Maynard from Tool contributes to &quot;Passenger,&quot; guaranteed to give  you a chill or two. So, don't hesitate to get your hands on this album. I  think the deftones are treating us to something special with the White  Pony.
6305903182|5.0|What a movie this is!I've been a HUGE fan of the series and i've been looking forward to seeing this final installment of the trilogy for ages..and boy was it worth it!The third Scream movie scores high for being  darker,different in character from the other two,very original at places  and yet still manages to link directly to the former two as a true trilogy  chapter should.As different as this one is though, you still get some  dejavou scenes reminiscent of scream 1 mostly,just like the other Craven  flicks &quot;A Nightmare on ElmStreet\New Nightmare,really cool.The new  line up of supportive actors are great too and the whole Stab3 thing works  brilliantly.Could't have hoped for a better finish to the series; thumbs  up.
B000002MG1|5.0|This is REM at there most beautiful. it is one of their best albums. From the brooding opening track Drive to the concluding find me a river the album is a delight. Along the way they manage to throw in classics like  wonderful nightswimming. It name checks people who died young as well with  references to both montgomary clift (who is also name checked on the  clash's 1979 classic London Calling) and andy krafman. This is REM's second  classic album after their brilliant debut Mummur.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Just a masterpiece for the eyes as well as the ears. One of their finest live performances. A must have for any true metallica fan, and if you aren't a fan this just might be the concert that will make you a fan.
B00000DMJF|4.0|Well, this is the Beatles I guess. The way they sound on this record is like nothing before it. The Beatles went everywhere in music genres, and most of the time it worked. Unfortunately, sometimes it didn't. And there's  just some songs that shouldn't have been on this. Boiling this down to one  record with all the best songs would have made this a much better listening  expierience than hearing the Beatles screw around in the studio and  what-not. The songs on this are lyrically superior to Abbey Road (but so is  'Please Please Me', so who's keeping track), but you can see where they  absolutely slacked off and did stupid, stupid songs (Wild Honey Pie, Why  Don't We Do It In The Road, Bungalow Bill, Me And My Monkey, Revolution 9,  Rocky Raccoon, Piggies). But there are some really really good shining  moments in this that make up for the bad tracks: Back In The USSR: A parody  of just about every Beach Boys song ever written, with a strong Beatles  backbeat. This is a great song, and it could have been a single, but I  doubt they'd do that (seeing as the song was more or less a joke).  Ob-La-Di-Ob-La-Da: I really don't like this song, but it has decent lyrics  so I guess it's ok. Happiness Is A Warm Gun: It depends on how you look at  this one. On one hand, it says absolutely nothing and is a waste of three  songs, but on the other hand it works. Birthday: Also depends on how you  look at it. The lyrics are abysmal and rarely rhyme, but the guitar is  so...imaginitive that it works. Helter Skelter: Lyrics here are also on the  short side (seeing a pattern here?), but probably the best downright heavy  metal song the Beatles did. Revolution 1: Nearly works as well as the  single version. It is noticably different (acoustic guitars, slower), but  great harmonies and horn work make it good in a way I can't explain.
6305165912|5.0|Okies, so there are a ton of great quotes in this film. So many of them have been used in these review titles that I was laughing out loud just skimming through the reviews.<br />I loved this movie, and in all honesty, could be one of my favorite movies of all time. I have watched this movie  at least 30 times and sometimes as many as 3 times in a day. Yes, I need to  buy more DVD's for my collection, but that is besides the point.<br />If you  like cohen brothers movies, or you liked fargo, or you just like to laugh.... Then this movie is for you.<br />If you are one of the very few  that dont like this movie, well, I genuinely feel sorry for you, because  you must not have a sense of humor. I dont think the comedy in this movie  is centered around drug use, although there is plenty of marijuana smoking.  Mostly its just a bunch of crazy people trying to get by between bowling  matches.<br />enjoy!
B00002E233|5.0|This movie is one of the very best since the Jaws series. The sharks really made it feel as if you were watching real life action. After watching this movie at least ten times, I  must say it is one of the very  best in its category. If you like suspence, action, and jumps, Deep Blue  Sea is your type of film.
0375707972|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It is right up there with the Catcher and The Rye.  I even had my highlighter out so I could mark the enteries that I wanted to come back  to.  Once I finished it  I picked it up and read it again.  Superb
B00004TL21|5.0|I love this whole CD. All of the tracks remind of the previous albums but, in their own way are different.  My personal favorite track is Elite.  I just can't explain why. Another un-emplicably excellenttrack is Passenger.  Once, again I can't explain why.  I love Digital Bath's kind of slowness.   It just has such a good beat that I listen to it over and over again.  I  recommend this to anyone who enjoyed The Matrix soundtrack or previous  Deftones CDs. Also, about the Red and Black limited CDs: they look cool,  but I don't think that they are worth an extra $$$.  But, if you love  Deftones then just get the red one or black one.  The red and black have  the same songs on them.  The Deftones started out very well, and they  haven't sold out!
0140288503|5.0|One of the best-written accounts of combat I have ever read. The mental images this book provokes will literally cause you to break out in a cold sweat. You will practically be able to taste the grit in your mouth!<br />I  can't say enough. Get it. Read it. Remember it.
6302181569|5.0|This has to be the absolute best science fiction movie of its era. The effects are good but the story is great. Landing on a supposedly deserted planet only to find the sole survivor of a previous mission and his  daughter the &quot;rescuing&quot; crew begin to be killed off by an unseen  monster. There are even some real moral questions here, like should man try  to play God and create life. This is much more than just a Saturday  matinee. When you eventually see this monster remember that the animation  was done by Disney artists. If you like early sci-fi and don't have this  one, you need it.
B00004TL21|5.0|The Deftones have really proven their worth...<br />Coming on strong with Adrenaline way back in 95, then growing stronger with Around The Fur in 97, now this. <br />What can I say? This album is magnificent, plain and simple.  The dynamics and structure in each song is so astounding, the lyrics  shocking and picture-esque (I can picture what Chino is singing about,  COMPLETELY understand what he's talking about). <br />From  &quot;Fieticeira&quot; through to &quot;Teenager&quot; to &quot;Pink  Maggit&quot; this album boasts a fantastic range of scenarios, dynamics,  excellent production and fantastic work by each member of the band  (especially DJ Frank Delgado... his presence certainly appreciated during  &quot;Change&quot; and &quot;Teenager&quot;). Maynard's voice on  &quot;Passenger&quot; is complemented by a terrific tune and excellent  vocals by Chino also, and thus he compliments them well too. <br />The sound  of Chino's voice on &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, &quot;Elite&quot; and  &quot;Street Carp&quot; have me in fits of pleasure.  This album does truly  prove that Deftones have the ability to become kings of the music world,  ever widening their boundaries and epic soundscapes, bringing the listener  to tears with each song. <br />Now, let me ask you...<br />Why don't you own this  album?
B000031X7T|5.0|I have been a fan of Pink Floyd for many years.  I feel that their music is truly inspiring, and that when one listens to it, one can hear what has inspired them.  This is more apparent in this album than any other.  I feel  that this is true with all live music in general.  You can hear their  passion in songs like &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; (which was by the way  done SOOOO great on this album.  It is truly something that all Pink Floyd  fans should own.  All music lovers in general would enjoy this album.
0441172717|5.0|Usually in science fiction, some compromise is made between those who want explorations of humanity and social dynamics at the expense of hard technical accuracy and those who want the opposite.  As brilliant as some  authors in this genre are, they tend to borrow their scenery and supporting  casts from established conventions of spaceships and near-magical  technology that follows no rule of science of which we are currently aware.   <br />While this is foremost a story about the lives of individuals, the  subtle and overt variances between life in this world and the one Herbert  envisions give life and strength to _Dune_.  You understand the value of a  cup of spilled dishwater on Arrakis as easily as you understand the fear of  Big Brother in Airstrip One, because Herbert and Orwell support their  world's differences throughout the entirety of their books.<br />What Herbert  does is to postulate several things, incredible to us now, that mark his  created world as very different from our own:<br />1) A ban on artificial  intelligence leading to the rise of humans trained to compute with the  speed and accuracy of a machine; 2) A universe where democracy does not  exist to any significant degree; 3) A universally consumed product that  everyone wants to prolong life and health that permits a small percentage  of its users to perceive the future.<br />Many of the secular inheritances of  empirical thought, from the early Greek mathematicians and philosophers to  the present, are strangely gone from this universe.  We assume that  computers shall take more and more of a dominant role in mechanisms of  labor and society; we assume that all humans are fundamentally equal and  that class divisions of a feudal nature are nonsense; we assume that  precognition is speculative and a fantasy yet unproven by any  science.<br />These alterations lend dimensions of interest to a book which  would otherwise be an exploration of an alternate ecology, of the  preternatural desert of Arrakis and the means by which its human residents  cope with the hellish if scientifically plausible conditions.<br />Don't  misunderstand me - the saga, the medieval melodrama still fascinates me  years after initially reading it during slow afternoons in sixth grade.   What locks this in your mind is the vast differences between this world and  the one that Frank Herbert describes, and very few have the sheer  imaginative faculty to equal his achievements.
B00004TL21|5.0|The best of the deftones!  Hard rock does not get any better than this.  The deftones blend true metal and hardcore with beautiful melodic vocals on White Pony.  There are very high expectations for the deftones on their  third cd but this lives up to all of them.  This album features a lot of  guest musicians which make the album even better.  I'd reccommend this cd  to anyone who likes Incubus, A Perfect Circle, Tool, Soulfly, and other  great bands.
B00003XACV|5.0|After seeing the movie, I was enchanted by the images and sounds of the film for days.  When I dicovered there was a score, I was frantic to buy it.    Without a doubt, this is the most powerful CD in my collection.  The  tunes, though short, can greatly influence your mood.  Listening to Track  1, &quot;Still Dead,&quot; can get you in an uplifting spirit; Track 2,  &quot;Arose,&quot; will cause you to dream of private fantasies.  The most  powerful songs, Track 8 and 18, titled &quot;American Beauty/Still  Dead,&quot; can bring tears to your eyes.  The melancholy piano of those  songs will bring you down into the greyest depression you've ever  experienced, which is good every one in a while.    If you loved the movie,  or just liked it, get the CD.  Images of the film will keep coming back to  you as you listen.
B00000DG1R|4.0|You can't fault the songs here, as all 19 of them are very good.  Many of them are, of course, even incredible.  But you already knew that unless you either lived on another planet in the 80's or are too young to remember  (the songs, not which planet you lived on).  However there is much to fault  about this collection.  The worst offence here is the edit of &quot;Save a  Prayer&quot; that leaves out parts of the second and third verses.  The  edit of &quot;Rio&quot; that appears here is also unforgiveable.  Another  big problem is that despite the ridiculously short edits of some tracks,  there are still at least a few glaring ommisions, such as &quot;Too Much  Information&quot; and &quot;Out Of My Mind&quot;.  Obviously, this  collection needed to be a double CD set, leaving room for the full songs  and a full collection of the singles.  Even cooler would have been if they  had rounded it out with some of the better b-sides.  <br />The order of what  is here appears to have no logic at all.  You might be tempted to think  that this seemingly random track ordering somehow results in a cohesive  sounding collection, but repeated listenings won't bear this out.   Chronological ordering would have been much better.  The enclosed booklet  manages to be fairly thick without providing hardly any interesting  pictures or information.  In the same amount of space they could have  provided a nice still shot from each song's videos along with chart  positions for each track.  Instead all you'll get is track names and  glimses of pictures seen only inside the letters of the band name across  each page.  In summary, I like having all these songs, but I bet I'll trade  this in as soon as I can afford to finish updating my original albums to  CD.
0060196122|5.0|Having been recommended this book by a good friend of mine, who knew me as a lost young person in this world, I read the book not only to feel excited but also had a renewed outlook on life.  There were many points in the book  that still stick in my mind ever so clearly as if I had read it yesterday.   But Paulo Coelho wrote that book in a way that made me say, 'yeah, how did  he hit the nail so precisely?'  Reading some passages gave me shivers  because Paulo was so right.  <br />Many times, we tend to hold back on  questioning or spilling our brains out for the sake of pleasing others  because they would thing that we are crazy for asking such question.   However, I have learnt a valuable lesson through this book - that is to be  mad (mad in a good way)once in awhile.  To do things once in awhile that we  might not otherwise do and may never repeat but something that makes people  say, 'He/She is MAD!'.  Through this book also, I have come to realize that  being myself and portraying the real me in a world filled with people who  are extremely afraid to show their real feelings and expressions, is OK.  I  can be myself and be different and not feel as though it is a grave sin to  be ME.  - &quot;Is Wanting to be different a serious illness?.....It is if  you force yourself to be same as everyone else: it causes neuroses,  pschoses and paranoia.  It's a distortion of nature, it goes against God's  laws, for in all the world's woods and forests, He did not create a single  leaf the same as another.&quot;  p. 153<br />Paulo Coelho wrote it so well  that I have come to conclude: You only live once.  Therefore, enjoy life to  the fullest!
B000002MG1|5.0|I got this record for the song Nightswimming, which is still pretty much my favorite song on it.  However, I've come to appreciate almost ever song on it in one way or another.<br />'Try Not to Breath' is a lyrical masterpiece  and it's driving force seems very natural and  un-forced.  'The Sidewinder  Sleeps Tonite' is incredably energetic, though I don't quite get the  message behind it.  'Sweetness Follows' is very melancholy, but rightly so.   'Nightswimming' gives me the impression that the singer is having a  conversation with a piano and the stringed instruments add to the effect.   This is one of the most beautiful song I have ever heared.<br />As a whole  this album does not fault and would be a good introductary album to a first  time buyer.
0805047905|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite book. The color illustrations are so vivid that they jump off the page at you like one of those Touch and Feel books. As a parent, I like the way that Bill Martin and Eric Carle think. They make learning fun instead of dull and provide a neat way of learning colors  and animals. At the end, they review all the animals and colors from a  child's standpoint.<br />I cannot recommend this book enough. If you like this  one, you should also check out Eric Carle's other books.
B00001OH7X|4.0|My first impression of \\"Lodger\\" was that it was a journeyman effort.  With time, however, I have come to appreciate it much more.  It remains inconsistent, and contains odd barriers, but its heart is strong.<br />The  barriers are the first several elements encountered with the disk, starting  with the unattractive cover.  The cover, of course, has nothing to do with  the music (neither does the name --there is no song called \\"Lodger\\"), but  it sets the wrong mood.  So does the first song, \\"Fantastic Voyage.\\"   Actually, the first several songs are mediocre.  If the other albums of the  \\"Berlin Trilogy,\\" \\"Low\\" and \\"'Heroes'\\" have stronger first halves,  \\"Lodger,\\" has a much stronger second half.<br />The album picks up with \\"D.J.\\"   \\"D.J.\\" is one of Bowie's most megalomaniacal hits, and is far more  enduring than other frequently heard songs like \\"Golden Years\\" and \\"Let's  Dance.\\"  \\"D.J.\\" manages to meld the avant-garde with a popular dance beat  and very edgy lyrics.  <br />\\"D.J.\\" gives way to one of my favorite Bowie  songs,   \\"Look Back in Anger.\\"  \\"Look Back\\" is musically upbeat but  lyrically foreboding. I'm not exactly sure what the song is about, but it  seems menacing.  Oblique Bowie is usually Bowie at his best.  The next song  is \\"Boys Keep Swinging,\\" which is fun and also clever.  The song's  cleverness is that it may not be as straightforward as it seems at first.   The title suggests a return to Bowie's earlier homo-erotic toying, but the  words don't necessarily convey any such meaning.   Instead, the song seems  to be an over-the-top joke about life as a male.  The humor value would be  greater still if Bowie's serious!  I can't hear the song without thinking  also of Bowie's groundbreaking video for it, in which he convincingly  portrays his own (female) backup singers.<br />\\"Repetition\\" is a setback that  comes across as preachy.  The music is not strong and, while its theme  against wife beating is noble, it is also totally unsubtle.  But \\"Lodger\\"recovers with its original closing song, \\"Red Money.\\"  \\"Red Money\\" can best  be appreciated after listening to Iggy Pop's \\"Sister Midnight,\\" which uses  the identical music and some of the same words.  This is the first and  probably best of many Bowie covers of Iggy songs.  I'm not sure either what  the song is about or what the point is about the different lyrics, but it  works.<br />\\"Lodger\\" is possibly the only album re-issued by Rykodisk with  \\"bonus tracks\\" that work at the end of the album.  The second version of  \\"Look Back\\" is not necessary, but at nearly twice the length of the  original it is noticeably different.  \\"I Pray, Ole\\" is a worthy addition to  the album.  Unlike many Bowie albums, the last song on \\"Lodger\\" is not  clearly a \\"closer,\\" so the extra songs fit reasonably well.  But they  aren't that important, so the current EMI reissue will suffice. <br />So, by  the end of the album, the first half doesn't seem so bad.  Mediocre Bowie  is better than most other music, and mediocre Bowie at this stage of his  career is better yet. \\"Lodger\\" doesn't make it into the top echelon, but it  comes close.
B00004TL21|5.0|the new album by the deftones ranks as their best in my mind because it really expands a lot from their two previous albums.  &quot;White Pony&quot; has a lot more variety in it than the first two album, including  the ballad, &quot;teenager&quot;, and the more melodic rock songs like,  &quot;rx queen&quot; and the new single, &quot;Change&quot;.  The band also  employs their turntablist Frank Delgado more on the album, providing the  eerie backdrops to songs like &quot;digital bath&quot; and  &quot;teenager&quot;.  Still, the album has many heavier songs in the vein  of the first album like &quot;Korea&quot;, and &quot;elite&quot;.  All in  all, the best album by the deftones to date.
0131103628|5.0|The standard C text book by the authors of C. On 272 pages it contains the following chapters: 1.) A Tutorial Introduction, 2.) Types, Operators, and Expressions, 3.) Control Flow, 4.)

It was written  before the time of makeing a book look very nice. But it's value lies in  the profound content (no-nonsense-type).
B00004TL21|4.0|When I heard Change (In the House of Flies) I knew I had to have this CD. Now it's out and it's really cool. Best feature is the songs actually sound different from each other.
B00002Z88D|5.0|S&amp;M is a unique album in that it captures everything that has caused Metallica to rise above the fray of other metal bands trying to make it.  Many fans complain about Metallica's new style that debuted on Load.  But  this new style is not a band &quot;selling out&quot;, but a band expanding  their horizons and becoming more creative.  Instead of Load, they could  have put out another album that rocked like their previous albums and they  would have made millions, but they would also be fading from our memories  as Korn and Limp Bizkit took over, just as Megadeth, Guns N'Roses and all  those other bands have.<br />S&amp;M represented another step forward in the  creativeness of Metallica.  It was an opportunity to try something new.   And what's the use of creating if you're not trying new things?  The thing  detractors can't see is that there's nothing wrong with styles of music  other than thrash metal.  A symphony is no different.  When you have 100  musicians pouring everything out, it can be pretty powerful.  So when you  combine the power of Metallica to this symphony you are going to have an  explosion.  Yes, Metallica had to play at a slightly slower pace so the  symphony could keep pace, but maybe that's not so bad after all.  We got to  hear all the nooks and crannies in each song.  To me it was more  exciting.<br />A DJ on the local radio station commented that he couldn't wait  until &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; was released without the symphony  &quot;ruining&quot; the song.  I beg to differ.  Without the symphony this  would be an average song that would be skipped, but with the symphony it is  a powerful song.  <br />So realize, this is an album that it truely creative  and powerful.  It is not a &quot;blast `em&quot; album or a moshing album  or anything like that.  But if you can appreciate a band stretching it's  horizons and expanding it's creativeness, you have to get this CD.  And if  you're wondering, my criteria for a 5-star rating is a CD that I can listen  to ALL THE WAY THROUGH and enjoy EVERY song.
0375703764|5.0|While I'm not usually a big fan of the horror genre, I found this book to  be excellent.  While initially it can be a bit of a struggle navigating  between what is in essence two narratives, eventually this becomes one of  the most intriguing features of the novel.  There is a great balance struck  as I found my interest level shifting back and forth between what is in  essence two very different stories.  While not drop dead scary, some of the  more subtle images created by the author are the ones that stay with you  and create the mood.  I would recommend it highly, but be patient with the  somewhat obtrusive print style in parts (although that does add to the  effect nicely).  Overall excellent and an extremely creative project.
6303282237|5.0|This is the story of a man who always tries to do what is best for God, king, and country.  From the beginning to the end, El Cid bequeaths a universal example of patriotism and leadership during hard times.  Anytime  I feel the world is falling apart, I pull out El Cid and find inspiration.   This story did begin as the actual Spanish legend of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar  and even though Hollywood has romanced it just a little, it still lives on.   The ending is the most dramatic commitment to inspire the troops that I  have ever seen.  We need more heroes like him.  This is a story of a man  who made great personal sacrifice to unite his country at a time when unity  seemed impossible due to religious and political differences throughout all  of what is now known as Spain.  I show it to all my Spanish III students  and they really love the ending!  It is also good for World Lit classes as  a Spanish legend during the Medieval period.
B00004TL21|5.0|This CD is definitely a departure from their other two albums. I didn't know Chino could sing, but in this album, he really worked on his singing. The really only &quot;fast song&quot; is Elite, even though it's slow,  sometimes different is good. it's still good and i recommend it to every  Deftones fan
B00004THAY|5.0|Clapton. King. <br />With just those two names on a label, the review - more often than not - could write itself. When word came out that the two had finally begun to work on a CD together, the expectations would obviously be  high. Boy, were they ever met! Clapton and King did NOT disappoint! <br />I  was really looking forward to this collaboration after seeing a couple of  concert functions on TV in years past that featured their interplay.  Because they have so much respect for one another and don't feel they have  to prove anything to each other, there is no &quot;stepping on toes&quot;  as happens all too frequently with pairings like this.<br />I read one review  recently where the critic slammed this CD for being too  &quot;sanitized&quot; and &quot;clean&quot;; he claimed the  &quot;edge&quot; of the blues standards done here was gone. Well, I beg to  differ, and wonder if he was listening to the same CD I was! The guitar  work of both men provides plenty of grit, and the growling vocals on  several of the tracks give it the good &quot;rough&quot; edge good blues  works provide. Sure, there are the laid-back tracks, but they are in no way  lacking in style or feel. <br />In the all-important &quot;first listen&quot;  category, this one hooks you from the first note of the first track, keeps  you locked in, and leaves you wanting more. One is eager to replay it  immediately.   If there are still skeptics out there who question Clapton's  takes on the blues, they frankly need to open their ears and listen to his  music more objectively. Between this CD and his equally outstanding  &quot;From The Cradle&quot;, there should be no debating his skills. As for  B.B., this CD also shows he is still in excellent form  and can trade licks  with anyone in the business. <br />Fans of blues music should come away very  pleased with this effort. B.B. King fans will know they have another  classic on their hands, and Clapton fans will welcome this return from the  R&amp;B-influenced - and slightly disappointing - &quot;Pilgrim&quot; CD. I  rank this as one of my top 2 CD's released this year (along with Neil  Young's &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;). This should deserve high recognition  come Grammy time.
B000002C1W|1.0|When I first heard this album in 1987 I liked it.  Then I listened closely to the words and wondered where the imagination and creativity of Floyd had gone.  To make matters worse, I saw the Waters-less version of Floyd in  concert that year, on their highly touted tour.  The show was like an AM  radio greatest hits session.  I walked away more disappointed than ever.<br />The magic isn't gone, but you need to listen to Obscured By Clouds, Dark  Side, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and The Final Cut to find it.  Gilmour  is a great musician, but he's no poet.<br />Take away the words and  Momentary Lapse of Reason is OK...
6305910103|5.0|The 5.1 sound is terrific.  The screen is super clear, and includes the edges the 'pan &amp; scan' videos have so long excluded.  It's like watching it for the first time.  For those of us Trek fans who have waited  patiently for years to see THE BEST MOVIE IN THE STAR TREK CANON, the day  has arrived!  Throw out those VHS tapes you've been watching so many times  the picture has gone bad.  If you don't have a DVD player, buy one!
6300214826|4.0|This is an excellent and darkly beautiful film. The sheer hopelessness and apparent endlessness of the war is achingly conveyed in almost every scene-- even those such as the spectacular Air Cavalry assault on a  Vietnamese village (look for Coppola in an earlier scene with the Cav as  the TV reporter urging Willard to &quot;Just go by like you're  fighting!&quot;). Robert Duvall comes close to stealing the show with his  blood-and-guts character, Colonel Bill Kilgore, the Cavalry commander.  Superb performances by Marlon Brando as Kurtz and Martin Sheen as Willard  rescue this flawed interpretation of Conrad. Sheen's internal narration,  set against a haunting musical score, holds the film together and is  beautifully delivered.<br />One rumored &quot;alternative ending&quot; of the  film is Willard's meeting with the widow of Kurtz, and it is a very great  pity that Coppola either did not film it, or cut it. It is the definitive  scene of the Conrad work, and might have been of this movie. By depriving  the film of the confrontation between Willard and Kurtz's widow, Coppola  threw away Conrad's central vision of the conflict between savagery and  civilization, truth and lies, moral courage and hypocrisy. This error is  inexplicable, and leaves us not disturbed and thoughtful, as the novella  does, but depressed and dissatisfied, hence, the four star rating.
B00004TL21|4.0|Being a fan of previous albums, White Pony kicks it down a notch.  A little more thought out, a little more in control, a little less screaming, White Pony brings it all together.  Instead of a band looking for an  appropriate rif to thrash to, White Pony is an ALBUM.  Definite thumbs up.
B00004TL21|5.0|This cd exhibits the Deftones versatality and musicality-both of which rock.  At times they provide haunting, drifting melody but most of the time they just give you straight up, adrenaline racing rock. Old and new fans  alike, get ahold of this cd.
B000002GEY|5.0|This is a classic 1970's album that is brilliant. The songs Take The Long Way Home, Logical Song, Lord Is It Mine, and many of the other songs, make you thnk that this CD is their Greatest Hits! 9 out of 10 songs are  fantastic. The only weak one is Casual Conversations. Gone Hollywood is a  telling song about how one minute you're on the bottom, and the next you're  on top. Breakfast in America is a song I enjoyed very much. This is a CD  that everyone should have in their collection. It has everythng. Great  music great lyrics and it's classic.
B000002L9W|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I like the David Lee Roth Van Halen lineup as much as the next fan. However, Dave shows us that he is able to incorporate other elements of music into his hard rock style. Of course Yankee Rose, Shy Boy, and Tobacco Road are loaded with great guitar riffs and classic DLR vocal stylings. However, the spooky Ladies Night In Bufallo offers a dark brooding texture that relies more on dynamics than volume. The cover of That's Life has a good backbeat but does not overwhelm the listener with overmodulated guitar lines. The guitar fills fit in just fine in the background along with the spunky strains of the Waters Family on background vocals. Goin' Crazy is another spunky jam with ecentric percussion beats and sharp guitar sounds. Overall, this is Dave's one great effort and truly rates at a 4 1/2 star level.
0451191153|4.0|I first read this book as a junior in high school, almost five years have passed and I have read it 4 times already(practically once a year).  This is an excellent story if you take it from a fictional point of view and it  is also filled with great political and ideological viewpoints.  I find  this book very inspirational.
B000002MIY|5.0|I tell you its a shame that these guys can't put out more music.  Ooops I forgot thsi is a Donald Fagen solo record not a Steely Dan one.  With Beckers many worthy contributions in the instrumental and song-writing  department one can easily forget.  None the less these eight tracks are all  very good.  Florida Room and Teahouse On The Tracks have ultra cool horn  arrangements.  Tomorrow's Girls shifts brilliantly between rock and jazz.  And the opening tracks just bops along nicely.  I could go on about the  other four tracks but you listeners should know that this is one  sophisticated recording worthy of your hard earned cash!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP is the best Rap CD ever made. I am not a big fan of rap, but with this cd I can listen to the whole thing without skipping a track. Eminem has a great humor and can really rap. The best  songs on the CD are Stan, The Way I Am, Marshall Mathers and of course The  Real Slim Shady. In my opion this CD blows past The Slim Shady LP in terms  of quality. There is more Rap and less skits. Do yourself a favor and go  pick this up you wont be disappionted.
B000000WJZ|5.0|No matter what I may be currently listening to, I can always come back to Siamese Dream.  This music will never go &quot;out of style&quot; so to speak, probably more so than any other Pumpkin record. I know because I own  them all.  Sure, it's an example of early-nineties &quot;alt rock&quot;  with its sometimes painfully self-conscious lyrics and guitar-laden  melodies, but it's music you can identify with and it gets under your skin.   I'll probably still be rocking out to this when I'm 75.
044651652X|1.0|Here's my interpretation:  This book is about two people who have hot sex for one week and then spend the rest of their lives broken hearted over one another.  PLEASE!  I felt pity for them, not sorrow or anything else.  Francesa doesn't even try to put the spark back into her marriage, and  Robert becomes celibate even though he's had a lot of one night stands?  Ugh!  In real life this would have been long forgotten.  This book makes a  whole lot of noise over nothing.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but  it just got worse.  Its obvious the author knows how to write well, its  just too bad he had to waste it on such a lame plot.  Do yourself a favor  and read something else.
B00004TL21|4.0|This is the cd that will finally make the Deftones a household name. While that may annoy many original fans, it is something that is well deserved. The White Pony shows that you can change your style without compromising  your integrity. Yes, this cd may make them popular, but don't call them  sell outs..call them geniuses. Everything about White Pony shows how much  the band has grown musically and lyrically. While the lyrics on the first  two cds were chaotic and somewhat cryptic, the lyrics on White Pony are not  only easier to understand, but you can almost figure out the meanings of  the songs. Chino uses his voice more as an instrument on this cd than in in  the previous two. The songs are melodic, beautiful and sometimes  haunting.The duet with Maynard of Tool on &quot;Passenger&quot; can give  you chills. While this cd is definitely not as hard as the first two,  Deftones fans should not be dissapointed. There is still enough anger and  angst throughout White Pony to satisfy them. They just show that anger in a  more mature, sophisticated way.
0380018179|5.0|I am at a loss for words regarding this book.  I loved it, it was a tapestry of plots and emotions.  The characters are rich with emotion, you can identify their wants and needs.  Buy youself a box of tissues before  reading this book.
B00001QEE7|5.0|I love Disney movies and this one is one of my favourites. <br />&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is truly a very sweet and charming tale of a girl who wanted more.  The songs in this movie are spectacular and they were stuck  in my head for a week. Watch this movie and you'll fall in love with  it!<br />Beautiful story!
0380804557|5.0|This is, by far, my favorite book of all time.  I got my college library  to order it for me, read it in a single evening, and fell in love.  This  book produced all of those emotions of a new relationship in me, all that  nervous tension, all that fear of rejection, and all that splendid  exhilaration of falling.  It is, quite simply, one of the greatest stories  ever told.  I fell so in love that my parents gave me a signed copy of the  hardback, illustrated by Charles Vess (which I really suggest you take a  look at, as Vess' illustrations are nothing less than perfect), but I loved  the unillustrated one first, the one that put the world of Wall and all its  inhabitants into my imagination so well that I couldn't imagine ever not  having known them. The story is great, and I think the book could be a  perfect graduation present, just about finding your heart's desire, working  so hard and being so blind to what you really want. The end was stunning.  I sat for ten minutes just enjoying the wonderful rush of emotions well  over me.  All the twists, the forgotten details shown to be the most  important elements of the story, the way it just all came together; Gaiman  is the finest storyteller we have, and his works are treasures to be  cherished for years to come.
B00004TL21|5.0|This CD is their best they have ever recorded. All the way through  tracks &quot;A New Murder&quot; and &quot;Change in the House of Flies&quot; is a great set of songs.  If you are a Deftones fan or even anyone that likes  popular music this is a must buy for you.
B000001FO4|1.0|YOull feel cold after listening to this CD, so bad it is. Not one song at all that make it worth the price. The singer (Kiefer) has a terrible voice, no inspiration at all.
B00004TL21|4.0|For hardcore Deftones fans like myself, this is definitely an album well worth the wait. The songs are defintiely made in typical Deftones style. There is a mixture of the fast hard rock songs, and songs near the  beggining of the cd with a lot slow, whispering lyrics which develope into  screaming rampages. 4 Stars!  Deftones keep up the good gloomy work of  ROCKIN!
B000002UZ1|4.0|The thing about this &quot;album&quot; that I am so opposed to is the concept.  Note, I am not a big fan of collections, especially when it comes to my Beatles CDs.  Here's the whole masterplan behind making a collection:  &quot;Take out the best songs, and leave out the crappy ones.  Hey, we're  saving the buyers some money (and putting it in our own pockets)!&quot;.   Well, the problem is the Beatles don't have any bad songs (well, almost  none).  You're just leaving out mini-masterpieces.<br />I really wanted to  give this album less than 4 stars, but how can I with songs such as  &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;Lucy in the Sky With  Diamonds&quot;, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, and &quot;I am the  Walrus&quot; just to name a few.<br />This album no doubt has great songs on  it, but how can you possibly have these songs without their original  context?  These songs belong with their buddies, not bundled together with  a select few.<br />The tracks from Sgt. Pepper stood out in my mind.  You get  the first 3 songs from the album, then skip straight to the last one.  Does  this mean the rest were just fillers?  It's really a disservice to both the  songs on this collection and those left out.<br />I guess this collection  would be OK for someone wanting a taste of the Beatles.  The major problem  is, after listening to the great songs on this collection, you decide you  just have to go out and buy some albums.  Well, you've just wasted $30 (or  $36, if you live where I do).  Any self-respecting music listener should  just go out and buy Abbey Road or Sgt. Pepper (and for the Red Album,  Rubber Soul or Revolver).<br />Final Verdict: definitely NOT an essential.   Only for those who don't like the Beatles but want to know what the big  deal is about.  It's just the tip of the iceberg.
B00000IQW0|5.0|I don't care what the critics say -- Battlestar Gallactica was NOT Star Wars for the small screen!  Gallactica is the embodiment of cult evolution theory (as noted in Charriots of the Gods and the likes) and a good ol'  fashioned down-to-earth good vs evil Sci-Fi flic.  Ok, I admit that I'm  remiss it only features a mono soundtrack, but to be honest, after the  first couple minutes, you become so involved in the storyline and (although  dated) decent special effects (for their time) that you really don't  notice.<br />This is a MUST-HAVE for any sci-fi buff!
B000002UCE|5.0|It's funny how you can have a song like &quot;Imagine&quot; on the same CD as &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;.  Still, it works (at least I think so).  If you're skeptical, just get it for the title track.  You don't have to  like the rest of the songs, it's a classic.  It's more than a classic, it's  a masterpiece.  As for the rest of the album, &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; and  &quot;Oh My Love&quot; are beautiful and touching.  &quot;How Do You  Sleep?&quot; is amusing.  Still, it's a little upsetting how sinister and  mean Lennon was towards his former buddy.  &quot;Those freaks was right  when they said you was dead&quot;.  Overall, the most Beatles-like album of  John's short solo career.  One of the best ex-Beatle solo albums.  NOT  another Plastic Ono Band.  Definitely an essential.
B000003NA4|1.0|OK, I'll admit that I'm not an expert on jazz, nor have I ever jammed with a member of Billie Holliday's old backup band. Still, just from the point of view of a person who enjoys a wide range of music in all its forms, I  must say that this is the worst record I've heard in years.<br />Yes, Diana  Krall can play the piano adequately. Patricia Barber is better. Krall's  vocals, however, leave much to be desired. It's like she's trying to be a  female Sinatra but lacks the skill to pull off the act. If I seem harsh in  my assessment, it is not for lack of fairness. I listened to this album  several times in the hope that it might grow on me. After all, how could so  many professional critics be mistaken? I can only conclude that their ears  are picking up something I've clearly missed, or that there is a  suspiciously powerful publicity machine working overtime on Krall's  behalf.<br />Her phrasing on &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot; is a good  example of how she is straining to accent certain syllables and words in  lyrics that came across as entirely natural in Sinatra's performance of the  same tune. And Krall's cover of the classic &quot;They Can't Take That Away  From Me&quot; is a pale and shallow imitation of the song Julia Migenes  sang so effortlessly and gloriously on her now sadly out-of-print LP of  Gershwin standards. Meanwhile, &quot;You're Getting To Be A Habit With  Me&quot; sounds not just joyless, but positively entombed under the weight  of its heavy and ponderous attempt to catch any kind of genuine spirit,  romantic or otherwise. And, speaking of Patricia Barber, she puts Krall to  shame as a popular chanteuse. Where Barber shades every line of a verse  with subtle nuances that convey a comfortable, easy grace with the material  she is singing, Krall is forcing it and projecting phony feelings that ring  false with every note. <br />&quot;Love Scenes&quot; does showcase an  impressive and obviously talented group of musicians in the background.The  arrangements are nicely composed, and the instrumental work is excellent.  The whole thing also appears to have been mixed with a sure hand at the  control board. This is a lavish production designed to make the most out of  Krall's mediocre voice and tepid delivery. Unfortunately, no amount of  orchestration can hide the absence of any real emotion or style in her  presentation.<br />She does have some potential. Perhaps Krall will mature and  learn how not to be so affected in her future projects, but for now, this  is one overhyped diva you would be well advised to avoid. Check her out if  you cannot resist the avalanche of glowing reviews, but beware, the  schmaltz factor is high here. Buy this at your own risk.
B000000H6D|5.0|Type O Negative should get at least five stars on every one of their albums. I own all except World Coming Down, but I have heard all the songs off of it, and every song that I have heard was off all of their albums  were the best songs that I have ever heard. So if you want to hear good  music listen to Type O Negative.
B00004TL21|5.0|its amazing u have to get this album, its better than their other stuff though a little mellower. the lyrics are emotional and some of the songs are sad such as Digital Bath and Teenager. There still some loud songs  though such as Elite.
6305180261|5.0|This video is totally awesome. It has the best of GN'R all squished onto this nice little video. It has 13 of the videos, from &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; to &quot;Patience&quot; to &quot;Since I Don't have You&quot;  and just about everything in between. A very cool item for every Guns N'  Roses fan out there. Plus, you get to see the evolution of GN'R from '87  when it started to '93 when it came to a halt. Like I said, very, very  cool.
B000001U3K|5.0|You know how usually when you hear stray songs that you really like by a single artist, it means you have to buy a &quot;best of&quot; collection or a bunch of different albums or something? Don't do it with Lou Reed. All  you have to do is buy this album. This album has the classic 'Walk On the  Wild Side,&quot; &quot;Perfect Day,&quot; (which, if you're in your late  teens or early twenties like me you'll best remember from the Trainspotting  soundtrack), and &quot;Satellite of Love.&quot; Plus, it has loads of other  awesome songs... this is one of those albums where every single song  complements the others and IS GOOD.  And, man, it's so cheap...

B00004THAY|5.0|B.B. and Eric reach new heights as they bare their souls through each note of music and lyric.  Amazing stuff that reaches even the jazz skeptic.  You need to listen and let yourself flow with the sounds to really understand  the unique sounds of both artists blending as one.
B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstein is one of the most original bands on the market today.  They don't come out with a new CD every week like N'Sync, and their music isnt asininely simplistic or talentless, or undistinguishable such as Eminem.   My favorite songs are  &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; &quot;Bestrafe Mich&quot; and  &quot;Spiel mit Mir&quot;.  All the songs on the CD are high quality and  original,  I highly suggest you take a look at this instead of the other  cut-and-paste bands out there.  Rammstein truly has talent, and I await  their next CD with little patience.
B00004TL21|5.0|White Pony is sort of different from Deftone's previous cd's.  Most of the songs are much more mellow and soft then those of Adrenaline and Around the Fur.  Still the songs are very good.

0875845851|5.0|This was an excellent book and I agree with others that you pick up more  on the second read. I learned a lot about disruptive technologies,  processes and ideas. This had great relevance to current and future  business strategies and &quot;world view&quot;, as well as placing many  past experiences in a clearer context. The text is not great prose,  and  many of the examples get a bit too detailed and didactic, but with every  one you see parallels to other industries and your own visions and  experiences. This is excellent not only for those trying not to be  overtaken by disruptive technologies but also for those of us looking for  disruptive opportunities.
B00000G5VI|4.0|Ask anyone to reel off their favourite Bowie albums, and chances are The Buddha of Suburbia will not make the top twenty. This 1993 effort is unusual in two respects - firstly it's the soundtrack to a BBC adaptation of Hanif Kureshi's terrific novel, and secondly, perhaps uniquely in his long and bizarre career, it's possible that in this one Bowie - the quintessential \\"Faker\\" - lets the mask slip. I have a hunch this is as near to the real David Jones as you're likely to get.<br />Here there's no talk of aliens, no lofty Dylan impersonations, no \\"passionate bright young things\\", just \\"living in lies by the railway line\\" and \\"screaming along in south London\\", all rendered in a broad Bromley brogue. Is this, perhaps, David Robert Jones to Ground Control?<br />The album is kind of skittish, in a soundtracky sort of way, with two obvious and pretty singles in the title track and \\"Strangers when we meet\\", and elsewhere instrumentals in the mode Mr. B. favoured in the Berlin era (only this time with a decidedly London feel to them).<br />It's forward looking too - there are snatches of the electro-neurotica which Bowie developed further in 1. Outside and Earthling, and the title track could sit quite inconspicuously on ...Hours. Perhaps this was the start of Mr. Bowie's metamorphosis into his current status of Living Work of Art and Internet Phenomenon.<br />My pressing (Arista/BMG) \\"benefits\\" from a hilariously pretentious essay in which Mr. Bowie bemoans the lack of exposure afforded to new English artists (and then has the temerity to feature that well known young \\"English\\" guitar player Lenny Kravitz on the album) all of which lends weight to the curiosity/unintentional humour value of this disc.
6302800420|5.0|Tootsie - where would the film world be without this 1982 comedy?  I  proudly own one of the funniest films, and it is gets watched over and over  - still to this day.  Why?  Dustin Hoffman features as an out of work actor  who takes a up a role as female lead on a TV soap.  Sound easy?  Not at  all.  To achieve this, he has to become a woman and that is where the film  achieves so much magic.   Watching Hoffman play Dorohty is so convincing  that by the end of the movie you forget it's him - Dorothy takes on a life  of her own.   The story is never short of entertaining, and features other  stars such as Jessica Lange, and Dabney Corman.  I must admit, I am not a  big fan of Lange but this movie doesnt let her steal the thunder - that is  for Hoffman and Dorothy.   Without giving too much of the film plot away, I  promise those that have not seen it a fantastic 90+ minutes of film. You'll  understand why they call Hoffman a character actor even more after seeing  it. 5+ stars in fact for this movie !
B0000027I6|3.0|Here Roger Waters displays his usual genius, which flawed by his usual failings in the sub-editing stage. The product (if I may be so bold as to commoditise an R. Waters record) is in part essential, in part thoroughly  disposable. Which is ironic, given that that's what Waters spends over an  hour railing against.<br />Should you have recently purchased a flash hi-fi  then this is the record for you. The production is exquisite, recorded with  Q-sound (the sleeve advises you to check your speakers are in phase by  listening to the dog barking at the start of the record. It should sound  like it's coming from the yard next door. I listened and thought, that's  odd, I can't hear a dog on the record, only the one in the yard next d...  heyyyyy!)<br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of total clangers in the  line up. The worst offender is &quot;the Bravery of Being out of  Range&quot; - an up-tempo rocker which, I suspect, was intended as a radio  single. Bad idea. Firstly, Waters is generally bad at up-tempo rockers.  Secondly, the lyrics are dreadful. They labour a simple (and fairly  uninteresting) point, which is made with utmost clarity in the title of the  song itself: The bravery of being out of range. OK, fine, got it. Let's  move on.<br />This failure to know when enough's enough is Waters' Achilles  heel. It's one thing to clearly state your point; quite another to insult  your listeners' intelligence by laying it on so thick they'd need an  anaesthetic to miss it. Waters' contempt for his own fans is legendary, and  this record makes it pretty clear it hasn't eased up. You can't help  wishing David Gilmour had been floating around, just to say, &quot;how  about sticking in this chord progression&quot; or &quot;Roger, that's  rubbish&quot;.<br />Happily what remains is Water's grand scheme and his knack  for a truly venomous turn of phrase. Seemingly the idea for Amused to Death  has been floating round since Dark Side of the Moon, and it shows in its  thematic richness. Here all of Waters' hobby horses are gathered in one  stable, and there are some marvelous moments: the duet with Don Henley on  &quot;Yellow Rose&quot;, Roger's view of Andrew Lloyd Webber's &quot;awful  stuff&quot; in &quot;It's a Miracle&quot;, and his dismissal of a world  &quot;out in the valley, warm and clean, the little ones sit by the TV  screen/No thoughts to think/No tears to cry/all sucked dry&quot;. Youch!  That's us he's talking about, Ma!<br />Had 15 minutes been shaved off the  running time this might be a great record, as good as anything Waters - or  Pink Floyd - ever did. It wasn't, and Waters might as well be describing  his own record when he sings - in another omissible song - &quot;preacher  or poet, who was it wrote/give any one species too much rope/and they'll  [er,...] &quot;fluff&quot; it up&quot;. Whoops!matic richness.

0671867369|5.0|Stephen Ambrose's &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is a beautifully written record of the trials and triumphs of a group of true American heroes. This book held me firmly in it's grasp from the moment I picked it up. This is  the type of narrative history that I thoroughly enjoy.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I really liked this cd with its upbeat tunes taht are awsome to dacne to. I would give the album at least a 4 for the songs lucky and satifaction.  I would suggest buying it.  And this is coming from someone who hates  britney!
B00000J2KX|5.0|I remember watching this with Amelia on HBO one night. She chased me around the room during the credits screaming &quot;REDRUM! REDRUM!&quot; but aside from that...<br />this movie WILL get to you just like it did Amelia  and myself. Jack Nicholson WILL scare you. Shelley Duvall WILL... thorougly  annoy you...<br />just don't expect it to be any better then the book. For  those of you rating it lower just because of this, you can't expect any  director, whether it be Kubrick or even HITCHCOCK, to make a movie better  then a novel written by the master of horror.
B000002IOW|5.0|This was the first Rush album that I ever bought...and like probably  everyone's first albumns..it remains a personal favorite...I have yet to  have an album by Rush or few others touch such a great and inspirational  part of me.  It is one of the best compiled albumns I have heard.  Granted  Moving Pictures is by far their most classic and accomplished work, Presto  is a whole different beast, almost uncomparable.  For Red Barchetta...there  is Scars and Red Tide and Presto...Peart's lyric's are perfect as a whole,  the albumn should be viewed as all songs connected into one body of  work...all flow together and give a complete picture of emotion, statement  and message...true I have a personal connection with the albumn...I  listened to it constantly while reading one of my favorite books, Rebecca,  ...but it still remains a great albumn for reflection and  inspiration....not to mention Rush, as always have a technical musical  talent that is almost flawless...
079073804X|4.0|This movie wasn't quite so chilling as people gave it credit to be. But rumors say the original version (several omissions were made, from what I hear.), people died from watching this movie. Yes, its true, they had heart  attacks.<br />This movie will be remembered as one of the scariest of all  time. Though its not that scary (at least in my opinion), it _will_ be  remembered as a classic and is definetly worth your time and money.
0553296981|5.0|This is the book that has impacted my life the most out of all of the books I have read in my entire life.  Anne Frank was given a diary on her 13th birthday.  She poured out her heart into it.  She was forced to go  into hiding when the Nazis were rounding up more and more Jewish people in  Amsterdam.  Her tales of the hiding place give descriptions of laughter and  sorrow.  You can see how much she matured from the chatterbox into a young  woman.  Her love for nature shows us when you have nothing, nature is  always there.  It also shows us to look at all that we have and not to  worry about what we do not have. Her wish was that she wanted to go on  living after her death.  She has impacted thousands of lives.  Please by  this moving book that you will never dream was written by a 13 year old  girl.
B000002LND|4.0|Madonna's Immaculate Collection is a must have for any fan. It's got &quot;Borderline&quot;, &quot;Into The Groove&quot;, and &quot;Papa Dont Preach&quot;, among many others. Its also missing a few songs like  &quot;Causing A Commotion&quot;, &quot;O Father&quot;, and &quot;Whos That  Girl&quot;. What about &quot;Dress You up&quot;? Still, it captures her  vital recordings more as a summary of her 80s-early 90s career than as a  colection.It does give fans a chance to get her soundtrack singles all in  one place, like &quot;Crazy for You&quot; and &quot;Live To Tell&quot;;not  to mention the two bonus tracks &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and  &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. Both of which are equally impressive. &quot;Justify  My Love&quot;,with its 1-900ish purrs, and &quot;Rescue Me&quot; with a  dark, poetic feel,end the collection on a promising note. The outcome? Well  lets just say Madonna could make three more greatest hits collections.
0440219078|5.0|This book really makes you think. It's about a kid named Jonas who lives in the perfect world-no wars, no poverty, no hunger, etc. But while you may think it's what our world should be like, you're wrong. Jonas is chosen to  be the next giver. He is given all types of memories of war, beauty, and  colors. He realizes you need freedom of choice to live, and his world is  not as good as it seems.
B00003CWQ2|3.0|Four stars seems too high, three seems too low.<br />There was a lot about this film that I loved. I don't really pay much attention to how movies are filmed (and get bored when it's pointed out), but the camera zooms in this  movie thrilled me; with a brilliant opening credits sequence to a shot  where the camera plummets about thirty storeys and then through a  road!<br />Brad Pitt puts in a great performance as a likable character who  does horrible things, Edward Norton (who incidentally I hadn't seen before,  apart from trailers for other movies) is also great as  office-nerd-turned-hero. The fight sequences are gritty and at times  gruesome. But the movie will start taking a dark turn (I remember thinking  &quot;I don't like where this is going&quot;), but then it doesn't quite go  where you fear. And the plot revelation in the last half hour is  brilliant!<br />Unfortunately, there are a bumps in the road that let down the  ride. Helena Bonham Carter basically ruins every scene she's in (just when  you're getting into a scene, she pops up just in time to make sure you  don't enjoy it too much), the endless orgasm scenes get boring and annoying  fast, and I found myself cringing at some of the acts of vandalism  (although most of it is quite amusing).<br />Otherwise, an entertaining and  well-crafted film.
B000002WPI|5.0|Ok,I have a few things to say. FIRST THING, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT GUY TALKING ABOUT. Willenium by Will Smith being the best album? Will Smith SUCKS.ok he can't rap at all. He raps like this, it all makes no  sense...&quot;I went to the park, then my dog did a bark, and then I played  baseball, at the mall, then I bought a Cd with my friend BB!&quot; It makes  no sense, but all of his songs make the top ten. No wait, what top ten,  what am I talking about. See Will Smith brainwashes you! Anyway second  thing this album is a classic, ok if you like pop, if you like country, if  you like rock, and of course if you like rap you will like this album. I  like all kinds of music, (well I only like some heavy metal, rock,  alternitive, rap) and I love this album. The whole album is good, It could  make you laugh at some of the humor, or make you get up in front of the  mirror and start rapping to the lyrics. Overall this is a classic album  that will apeal to people who like pop, rock, pop rock, heavy metal,  rap/metal, alternitive, so on and so on...
0375703764|4.0|What a cool book!  It is extraordinarily hypnotic.  I really liked all the footnotes and &quot;faux&quot; book and journalistic sources. Danielewski creates a mirror-image world of our own, with just enough cracks in the mirror to produce a sense of horror. (The phoney Camille Paglia quotes are priceless.)
B00004T0P1|5.0|How a score this fully developed, robust and exciting can be produced in Hollywood of this day and age is really a miracle.<br />James Newton Howard is one of the best out there right now, and this is him at the top of his  game. Worth buying just for the five minutes of score we all heard last  year in DINOSAUR's extended, no-dialogue preview. But that was literally  just the beginning. <br />If you enjoyed Hans Zimmer's LION KING or POWER OF  ONE, you will most definitely enjoy this CD... a thrilling mix of  prehistoric rhythms and full-blooded orchestral writing, with hands down  one of the most exciting action themes of recent memory (heard in full  glory halfway through track 7, &quot;Raptors / Stand Together&quot;). <br />A  major work in film scoring from a composer who keeps getting better and  better.
0805062971|5.0|It is in life that you reach the point. Better, THE point. When you cant sleep, think or do anything because this world that you live in is an economical crap. Everything is about money, succes, getting better, bigger,  more powerful then anybody else. But if you look harder, you see that you  are falling down. Falling fast. Fast as this book? Maybe. You see, this  book is great example, what can really happen someday to us. Aliens,  A-Bombs, volcanos, godzilas, dinosaurs, viruses can come, and maybe they  will. But ask yourself, what is more possible: to be zapped by an alien  laser or killed by a guy, who is fed up with life because its full of s**t  and greed and without sensitivity? Read this book, wach a movie and see,  what could happen. Impossible? I dont think so.
B000003NA4|2.0|Sounds like this Saloon singer had a little too much.Over use of the breathy sound is not very good vocal technique and to me is not sexy.  The breathy  sound should  be used sparingly otherwise it sounds lazy and  boozy.
0684867621|4.0|This a terrific Stephen King novel that, right from the start, is a little different from many of his other novels: it's a lot shorter.  Here, King doesn't use endless narrative as he sometimes does.  Instead, he writes a  succinct, spooky story of Trish McFarland, a 9 year-old girl (who's tall  for her age) who gets separated from her family in the New England woods.  She is left to fend for her herself, and she finds solace in her beloved  Boston Red Sox, and their relief pitcher, Tom Gordon.  During her travails  in the woods, she encounters hallucinations, the downside of drinking  stream water, and what may or may not be a large bear.<br />King is blessed  with an incredible ability to place the reader in the minds of ALL of his  characters, whether they are 9 or 99, by thinking like they do.  Here, he  creates a novel that isn't really horror, but a suspenseful one that  crackles with imagination, baseball, and of only wanting to come home.
0783230664|4.0|Babe is the only series of films that through playing the theme song I actually start tearing up. The first one is simple, and so meaningful. Every moment is crafted to stick in a persons head forever, and that makes  the film that much more precious.  Everything about this DVD is excellent,  but what I ask is, where is the WIDESCREEN VERSION!  The images in this  film are so meticulously crafted, depths of fields are perfect, composition  is subtle, but it really matters. Everything about this movie is quite  brilliant, but the DVD is lacking the original filmmakes vision to it's  fullest extent. Yes buy this film, because it is the best of the available  editions of it, but be prepared when half a sheep in the foreground is cut  off, or when Babe and His Owner walk onto the field at the end, and it  doesn't seem half as big as when you saw it at the movie theatre, and  therefore far less imposing. And I give it a 4 out of 5 because of that  alone.
B00004SPYK|4.0|Stylish, beautifully designed movie. Unfortunately, the dvd has been color-corrected to remove the wonderful cool hues of the movie, which made it look as if had been shot through sunglasses. Scenes shot at dusk or  night have been lightened to look like day. It's a shame this was done to  such a styligh movie.
B00003CX6P|5.0|Being on the side of moviegoers that hated &quot;The English Patient&quot;, I was not expecting much when I first saw this new film by director Anthony Mighella in theaters. But it is a disturbing, compelling  thriller that has been beautifully shot on location in Italy. <br />The acting  is outstanding - Jude Law received a much-deserved Supporting Actor  nomination for his role in this film. But Matt Damon, who is in every scene  as the tale is told entirely from his point of view, was clearly overlooked  for his subtle performance in the title role.<br />The bonus features on this  DVD include scene-specific commentary by Minghella, two theatrical  trailers, a collection of interesting interviews with the cast and the  director, two featurettes, and two music videos featuring clips from the  film. More than the usual, but nothing to write home about. But the 1.85:1  aspect ratio of the DVD does the beautiful cinematography and frame  composition justice. And that's actually what makes this disc a must-have.  But be warned that the layer transfer (when Freddy knocks and interrupts  Tom's piano playing) is noticeable and annoying, at least on the copy I  have.<br />I wish this film had done better in theaters, as the rest of the  &quot;Ripley&quot; books by Patricia Highsmith would have made for  excellent sequels. But it looks like this film will have to stand on its  own... and it does a brilliant job of doing just that.
B00004SST6|5.0|As a jazz guitarist, I have listened to Benson since he began playing with Jack McDuff in the early 60's (B-3 organist) and his aptitude and soulfulness has gotten better with age.<br />Like a fine wine in time, so too  does Benson let his soulfulness shine.  I enjoy this CD very much.   &quot;Tenderly&quot; is one of the best CDs Benson has put out and this one  mirrors this and revives what Benson does best!  Play classic jazz with his  trademark octave solos with the 5th inserted!<br />Norman is hardly the versed  (ALL AROUND) player Benson is as longevity and legitimacy mean much. I  certainly am not bespattering Norman's brilliant guitar abilities  however!<br />Benson is a natural and his practicing between sets some 30  years ago when he did play with McDuff blended with his native proclivity  for soul and unique solos make him a jazz guitar player's guru and proven  guitar coach!<br />Benson is NOT a sell-out and this was evidenced when he  sang, &quot;I Just Wanna Be Around You&quot; off of his 1985  &quot;20/20&quot; Album/CD release!  This is a beautiful contempory R &amp;  B ballad and if this makes him a sell-out, I'm glad he did for this  particular CD and during the year 1985!<br />Five Stars again for brother  Benson!<br />Respectfully, Brian G. Jett
B00004SYWZ|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been 15 years since their first album came out and 7 years since their last! But one thing isn't hard to believe - this is their best album EVER!  It is a masterpiece! The boys have come back from their various solo efforts and compiled an ecclectic mix of songs. Each of  the three have had major influence in writing the songs and it shows. You  can sense the Savoy influence in songs like Velvet and the Sun Never Shone  That Day. Morten Harket's vocals are excellent once again' deep and moody  in some and spine-tinglingly high and bright in others.  This is a MUST  have for AHA fans and hopefully it will introduce the group to new  listeners as well.
B000024D0J|5.0|This album, &quot;Enter the Wu Tang 36 Chambers&quot; was the birth of the Wu-Tang Clan.  This import version contains 13 tracks, 12 of the originals and remix by a British DJ.  Bottomline, this album is essential for any  real hip-hop collection.  Probably the mosted sampled albums out there for  containing the most raw and original style anyone had ever heard.  In other  words a smart buy.
B000003TA4|5.0|There's no denying this album's place in music history.Not only did it kill Poison,arrest Warrent,and clip Winger,but it defined the greatest rock period since the late 60's early 70's.We get ..Teen Spirit,but we also get  Come As You Are,Lounge Act,In Bloom,Breed,Polly..lets just say the whole  damn album.Not only do we get hard rock but hooks to match.The Seattle  revolution of 91-96 will live as a beautiful time.Nevermind was not just a  soundtrack,but the epitomy.
B00004TL21|4.0|i guess change is good for all of us. This is the album we waited three years for. Ill just say this- if you preffered songs like Headup, Engine #9 and 7 words, you probably wouldnt like this album at all, with the  exception of elite and korea.But if you liked the softer stuff more like  fireal, dai the flu and be quiet and drive, youre gonna love this cd.  Maynard James Keenan of Tool makes a specail guset apperance on  &quot;passenger &quot;
B0000027RL|5.0|Later albums may be more tighter and complexed(as well as a bit pretensious),but Ten is the raw,relentless Pearl Jam we've fell in love with.Along with Nevermind,Ten encapsulates the 90's music revolution,where  hairbands became extinct and music became more serious and less  product.Even Flow,Alive and Jeremy are etched in our neural pathways,but  Once,Oceans as well as Black transcends this album to classic  status.Release is the ultimate album closer as it shine a light through the  darkness.Even if you've hated what Pearl Jam's been doing lately,return to  Ten if only to remind yourself why you fell in love with them in the first  place.
2020090791|5.0|I heard about this book from a review for a video game entitled &quot;Mother 3.&quot;  After reading it, I was impressed by the amazing writting.  The storyline, based on the bond between twins, was amazing.  It  felt like an RPG (Role Playing Game) in a book.
B000006MS3|5.0|This is one of the most daring, inventive, and progressive albums of all time! I kid you not. It's her best, my favorite... Right in peak form in 1982, Kate goes to the extreme emotionally/vocally. I wish I COULD find a  song to skip on this album. Night of the Swallow swoops and keeps swooping  upon you with each repeated refrain. There are loops, swirls and color -- I  don't know music terminology... There is immense texture! You see, art  terms. This is art-rock after all. And not too girly/wimpette like some of  the earlier stuff. The Houdini piece is a great love song. Leave it Open:  Ohh, weird background vocals and structure. I'll leave it to a woman to  convey her Get Out of My House! Suffice it to say it's about rape(?)  Devastatingly fierce! The title track is trippy, Sat in Your Lap is fun, I  mean it's not ALL heavy. But it's dense and very very listenable. What a  classic.
B0000019PA|4.0|I've found that this album has some of the most strangely moving music I've heard in a long time.  It's a little inconsistent and occasionally feels self-indulgent, but nonetheless is unique and a worthy addition to  any CD collection.  I find that I can't put it on as background music.  It  demands (and deserves) attention.  Musically, it makes me think of Captain  Beefheart.  It can be hard work listening to it, but very worthwhile.   There are tremendous layers of sound and the vocals are very compelling.   Just make sure you give yourself time to listen.
B00000JS1M|5.0|I think this is one of the best metal albums of all time.  I thought it was incredible when it first came out and it has not lost its punch today.  Saxon never acheived the success they deserved but with great bands like  this that is to be expected.
B00004TL21|4.0|We've heard how great the new deftones album is but i'm sorry, it doesn't live up to the hype.Some songs are stunning (Elite, Change etc) but there are songs which let the album down. It's not as mellow as the other two  albums, nor is it as heavy. The songs all have a very similar sound which  is a shame for such a top band. Still it isn't bad, just not up to their  usual standards
0780021967|5.0|A stylish blend of mystery, romance and light humor, \\"The 39  Steps\\" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest achievements.  Unfortunately, the public-domain status of this 1935 classic has resulted  in plenty of inferior video copies at cheap prices. Avoid them! You're  better off purchasing the Criterion release, which features a stunning 35mm  print and some nice bonuses. \\"The 39 Steps\\" represents the  highpoint of Hitchcock's British period and should be seen in the best  possible quality. In terms of value for money, the Criterion version  remains second to none.
6305800073|5.0|I am a native Nebraskan, so I followed the Brandon Teena story very closely when it actually happened.  I was eager to see the movie when I heard about the production.  I was not disappointed!  Hilary Swank did an  excellent job portraying the young woman who loved and sought love the best  way she knew how.  Watching this, it was hard to remember that she is  actually a female living as a male.  Her portrayal was right on the money.   Chloe Sevigny also did a fabulous job as Brandon's love interest.  She  portrayed a person who loved from the heart and not from the mind.  The  reality was brutal, but very true.
B00004TL21|5.0|It's a revolution and revelation  in the rock music, excellent CD , I have heard some songs, but I think it's a pretty well CD, it sounds great!. The CD is a fusion the grunge, punk and a bit of heavy metal, includes several  influences  from other groups  like  Depeach Mode and others, I think this  album can be clasified like  one the best of the year in the rock music, it  has a many infuences from others countries inside the group, for example:  Latinamerican, China and North American, the mixes of the metal sounds  makes this album a nice experience.  I just to say &quot;this album is very  very good&quot;.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|This DVD is definately value for money at NZD$39.95 plus a CD single. This has all of Whitney's well know video clips plus a couple of live recordings as well as the making of the album.  I was truely entertained.
B00004TL21|5.0|Truly an excellent cd from a truly excellent band!
0767819594|4.0|I love this movie, I love it a lot.  I dont think that there was too much homosexuality in it, and I think if its a good movie it has to warp a couple minds, thats why its rated R anyway.  I like the manipulation that  takes place in the story.  Sarah Michelle Gellar has also never looked  better in anything she has done.  After I watched this, I said to myself, I  didnt know movies could be made like this (I had never seen Dangerous  Liasons) I was stunned and in awe.  So I watched it again and again and  again.  It was great the first couple of times but there are points where  the story gets too lovy dovy for me.
B00004TL21|5.0|WOW is all i can say. I popped this cd in and was amazed!  I can say that this whole album is excellent. I definately would not classify these guys with the rest of the rap-metal-aggro(whatever you want to call it) crap!   They rule!  RIDE THE WHITE PONY... you know the rest!
079213690X|5.0|I haven't seen a better movie. I own this now, since i was only 6 or so when it was in theatres. OK, this movie is filled with: action, adventure, drama, love, violence, gore,  and much more!<br />I mean, it's soooo sad, i  actually cried at the end when william is being killed. Those English  bastards. Just untie he freakin rope and let the poor man go! Also, it's so  sad that i had to FORCE my dad to watch the movie, since he'd never seen  it. I think this movie deserves a 99 out of 5 because it rocks, also it  shoul get more oscars!<br />The movie just can't be described in words! I love  it. I should tell you that if u are seeing it for the first time, and you  always scream at the sound of blood, you may want to fast forward during  the battle scenes. I know because my dad couldn't stand them!<br />Oh yeah,  about the love story- it's pretty cool, though yes, people, it's sad Murron  was killed, but that was one of teh main points of the movie! I think  Murron was not THAT pretty, she just had a nice smile. I think that sophie  is HOT! WITH THE FRENCH ACCENT AND ALL- u know...
B00004TL21|5.0|This new release, &quot;White Pony,&quot; by the Deftones is an extraordinary record that culminates and overpowers with thick warm grooves while recklessly abandoning the conventionally monotonous.  &quot;White  Pony&quot; contains sonic landscapes that move from moments of melancholy  and duress to unmeasurable chaos and rebellion; a charged resistance and a  unifying liberation at the same time.  The first song,  &quot;Feiticeira&quot;, is reminiscent of the band's earlier material,  powerfully pulsating rhythms and turbulently thrusting tempos.   &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, the second, conjures up a sort of beauty that  lurks in the darkness.  Other songs, such as &quot;Elite&quot; and  &quot;Street Carp&quot; are further expressions of the innovative Deftones  while maintaining the classic Deftones style, unabashed, seductive and  pleading. The intoxicating and intransigent &quot;White Pony&quot; at  maximum audible decibels will be a pleasurable petition to the skies.
B00004STPT|5.0|I saw the movie before I bought the soundtrack, and I love both of them.  The music on this sound track is simply amazing.  I let some of my friends listen to it and all of them loved it.  In my opinion, the music has  emotional power that could beat out John Williams.  Plus, the types of  music varies from peaceful and slow, to up beat and moving.  It will leave  you with the great tunes stuck in your head.  I recommend that if you've  seen the movie, get the sound track.  Get it even you haven't seen it too.
0440403278|5.0|This is a great and realistic book. When you read it, you feellike you are one of the characters. It also teaches you a lot abouthistory, and what life was like in the early 1900's. Some parts are emotional, and others are fun. It will not take you long to fall in love with this wonderful book.
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones finest release yet! Don't let the mellow start fool you die hards, this one, The White Pony , plays out with all the subtleties of a sledge hammer to the sac! Take not of Passenger, track 9, featuring Maynard  James Keenan from Tool/ A Perfect Circle, and change, track 10. All and all  a crushingly good effort!
B00004TL21|4.0|White Pony shows the more melodic and experimental side of the Deftones.  Though songs on this album differ from their previous albums, their edge is present on songs like &quot;elite&quot; and &quot;korea.&quot; However,  &quot;teenager&quot; may throw you off from what you expect to hear from  the Deftones with its subtle electronic/techno influence. The rest of the  album is melodic like &quot;change&quot;, &quot;digital bath,&quot; and  &quot;pink maggit.&quot;  If you like Tool/A Perfect Circle, (perhaps) Hum,  then you might like this album or the Deftones in general.

B00004LN16|1.0|Im a huge AC/DC fan. SO, I waited eagerly for the last four years for their new release. Oh, what a disapointment!  NOthing saves himself in this lousy album, which seems a mockery to fans. It is clear the band no longe  cares in composing great simple rock songs. Instead, they simplified it to  the point of sheer mediocrity. Brian Johnson completely lost his vocals.  Well, its the same thing as with other bands like Iron Maiden, Sabbath,  etc.. they go on living by their names, while fans keep awaiting for their  new &quot;masterpieces&quot;, which never comes...
B00003Q438|5.0|I love it. We spent hours watching the movie and the background material.  My main reason to buy DVDs are the special extra things like Making Offs.  Abyss gets a 5 star in this category.  The picture quality was okay. The  only down thing  I can see is, that some of the background information  requires reading, lol. But the special effects info is great. Watch it.  Make a &quot;wet&quot; DVD day and watch TITANIC later.
B000001FO4|1.0|If the stepmother had done it right, Cinderella would never have found her Prince, and would still be locked in some garage house researching their lousy music, without releasing any more garbages like this CD. Dont buy  it, dont even hear it, its the worst kind of glam ever made.
B000002U82|5.0|No doubt an amazing sensation of an album.  However, I always thought &quot;Money&quot; was the buzz killer. :)
B00003IQQA|5.0|I think that the band creed is way ahead of their time. This album is one of the best albums of all time. When me and my wife bought this album late last year, we couldn't stop listening to it. We even bought MY OWN PRISON,  right after. The songs on HUMAN CLAY were a mixture of personal as well as  spiritual thoughts. The religious undertones combined with hard guitar  riffs proved that this band knew what they were doing when they put this  album together. They truly came out of nowhere. They are right at the top  of my list of all-time &quot;alternative&quot; bands, and being a native of  Seattle, I know what I am talking about. I think that with continuing  cutting edge ideas in song, this band will be around for a long time to  come. I would recommend this album, as well as their last, to anyone!
B000005GX7|5.0|Short and simple: if you play tenor sax this CD belongs in your collection. Joe Henderson runs through a variety of styles, both traditional and non, showing what the tenor is capable of doing in the  hands of someone well-versed in all styles of jazz. With backing by Ron  Carter and Al Foster, the trio lets the lines of each composition stand out  like strands on a spiderweb. Again, if you are serious about jazz this is  something you need to check out.
B000002V0Q|2.0|This is the album where Dave Mustaine decided to make Megadeth MTV/radio friendly, and frankly, the previously aggressive Megadeth suffered heavily. Only one track (&quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;) captures the feel of  Megadeth's masterpiece &quot;Peace Sells .. But Who's Buying?&quot;, while  the rest is a not-so-coy attempt to make Megadeth more acceptable to the  MTV generation.<br />Gee whiz Mr. Mustaine, wasn't &quot;Peace Sells&quot; an  ironic comment on the vapid generation of Americans spoon fed information  and entertainment on television? If this album was a savage parody of metal  bands selling out, give it four stars. As it is, it's going to have to get  by with two from me.
0884271536|3.0|This book teaches some concepts regarding project management that any experienced project manager already knows. Experienced project managers know to pay attention to all the critical dependencies in the project, not  only the critical  path. Cutting all estimates in half and adding one third  at the end of the path as a buffer sounds like a good idea in principle.  However, it easily falls apart in reality when you realize that most of the  projects fall under the other end of the spectrum by being too optimistic.   It is important to mention that by writing this book in a novel format, the  author does not have to be as thorough as in a non-fiction business book.   This is just a novel and should be treated as such. As for the  &quot;new&quot; concepts, you will be better off by practicing the basics.  Get the PMBOK from the Project Management Institute, read it, apply it, and  your projects will benefit a lot more.
630575067X|5.0|This was a great movie and some of the best special effects ever seen in a  movie to date, still it was no match for the awe inspiring Return of the  Jedi.
B00000K0DV|2.0|I felt sick when first saw this so called giallo  masterpiece .The film isn't even close to Fulci's best films such as House by the cemetary or Beyond ,but it isn't as bad like Rome 2033 or Cat in the brain aka.  Nightmare concert .The film tells about a serial killer who has disgust  against &quot;loose&quot; women such as hookers strippers etc. To solve  this problem the killer mutilates the victims in a gory scenes such as  slicing victims nipples which is shown very grotesque way .The dialoque on  the film is very funny though and the Donald Duck like voice of the killer  is making you wonder is this suppose to be a very sick comedy or just truly  bad horror flick .I would rather recommend Jess Franco's Jack the ripper or  Dario Argento's Bird with a crystal plummage if you're looking for good  eurothriller stuff .Picture quality of the DVD is not that great ,but still  better than any other VHS version of the film .Sound is a bit bigger  disappointment ,but if you are hardcore fan of Fulci or Italian giallo  cinema then this DVD should be in you're DVD collection .
B00004TH83|5.0|I first heard Lara Fabian on one of my visits to Montreal.  I always thought she had an excellent voice, and I was very pleased to hear that she was going to start recording in English too.  I bought this album when it  was released in Canada, and I thought it was unbelievable.  Her voice has  such power and a very soulful quality to it.  I was driving back to the US  last Feb, and heard the cut, &quot;Love by Grace&quot;, which I had heard  by Wynonna and at least one other English singer before.  Lara's version  really affected me.  I found myself very moved.  I highly recommend this  album.
6300214354|5.0|I saw this movie when I was in the 4th grade and it is still my all time favorite.  Val Kilmer is excellent and the jokes are non-stop.  If you have seen all of the Airplanes, Naked Guns and Hot Shots, you still need to see  this movie.  It is quite similar and yet very unique.
B00004T1NA|5.0|A friend of mine just returned from London with a copy of Lightbulb Sun in hand (I asked her to pick it up for me while she was there).  For the past two days, I've listened to it over and over and OVER again. This CD is  unbelievable in its depth and complexity!  The music is mesmerizing and  incredibly moving.  The lyrics are as clever as ever.  The vocals are  trademark Tree.  Woven throughout are snippets of sounds, conversations,  laughter.  Lightbulb Sun takes the power and precision of Stupid Dream to  another realm, another musical level.  From the delicate acoustic guitar  intro and vocal (that quickly becomes an electric guitar riff worthy of  Jimmy Page) of the opening title track to the haunting &quot;How Is Your  Life Today?&quot; (check out the vocal harmonizing and the herky-jerky  carnival piano!) to the oh-so-catchy &quot;Four Chords That Made a  Million&quot; to the epic-length (13 minute) &quot;Russia On Ice&quot; to  the closing track, the heartbreaking &quot;Feel So Low,&quot; Lightbulb Sun  is an astonishing musical statement from a band that just keeps getting  better.  Because of its level of musicianship, its ability to draw me in  and its uncanny ability to flow from melancholy to upbeat, Lightbulb Sun  has become one of my all-time favorite albums.  I put my portable CD player  on Repeat and listen to Lightbulb Sun with my headphones on all day long at  the office (I'm a copywriter in an ad agency so I can get away with that  sort of thing).  Buy this album NOW...and hope Tree tours near you this  year!
0783241569|5.0|I love to watch violent action movies, but I am still a sucker for the occasional good romantic comedy.  I've seen several that don't quite cut it, but notting hill is an exceptional movie.  From a guy's point of view, this movie is unique in that the woman (Julia Roberts) makes the initial  mistake of treating the man [poorly], and then she has to come begging him  to forgive her.  Also, the supporting cast of quirky friends is excellent.  Through them, you really get to know Grant's character.<br />Also, the fairy  tale story of a movie star falling for an average guy keeps this movie from  following the path of cliches that all other romantic comedies do.
B00003CXC7|5.0|\\"We've become a race of peeping toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change.\\" So says Stella (Thelma Ritter) at the start of \\"Rear Window\\". Alfred Hitchcock's best film and one of my all-time favorites. It's a key line into the film which was taken from a short story called \\"It Had To Be Murder\\" written by Cornell Woolrich and made into a screenplay by John Michael Hayes.<br />\\"Rear Window\\" gives Hitchcock the chance to explore one of his favorite themes;voyeurism. L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photographer for a magazine who managed to break his leg in an automobile race track accident. He has a cast from his foot up to his hip and has been in it for 6 weeks. Jeffries' passes his time by staring outside his window looking (or spying) at his neighbors. I've noticed many people seem to overlook something cruical in this. Jeffries as the saying goes is a \\"watcher\\" NOT a \\"doer\\". He is by profession a photographer. He's always seeing the world through his lens. Never actually experiencing life himself. I bet even if he wasn't injured it seems like the kind of thing this guy would do anyway. It's in his blood. It's how he makes his living. By capturing moments of people's lives or popular events. But, one day, Jeffries is going to see too much.<br /> What makes \\"Rear Window\\" such a great film is the way the screenplay is constructed. The viewer never knows more than the lead character. Everything we see, we only see becuase that's exactly what he sees. We can only draw the same conclusions he does, because we only know as much as him. If he says 1+1=3, we have to go along with him, because we don't know otherwise. And this is where all the suspense leads in. You see, for those who have never seen this movie. Jeffries thinks he has seen one of his neighbors murder his wife. Mr. Thorwald (Raymond Burr, who would later become a lawyer, go figure!) was seen leaving his house several times durning the night. We see him wrap up a saw and knife. And the next morning his bedridden wife is gone! Was she murdered? Or is there a reasonable explaination for everything? We are lead to believe she was murdered.<br /> Hitchcock has such a confident feel for the material. I don't know if his directing was ever better. Some may argue \\"Psycho\\" or \\"Vertigo\\" but, whichever film you chose you can't deny how brilliant his directing is here. The way he adds to the suspense. Our emotions go back and forth. Was there a murder committed or not?<br /> As with all Hitchcock films you can expect that dry wit. In my opinion it has never played off as well has it does here. It's all over the place. Take Thelma Ritter for example. She plays an insurance company nurse sent to take care of Jeffries. Her dialogue is full of witty remarks. Just about ever word she choses to use seems inappropriate at the time. There is also a character named \\"Miss Lonelyheart\\". A scene involves her getting dressed up, ligthing some candles, dimming the lights, fixing the dinner table and than pretending she has a gentleman guest. It may not sound funny as you read it, but, to see it will put a smile on your face.<br /> Besides Stella (Ritter) no one enters Jeffries apartment except Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly, looking her absolute best!). A designer who is a well known Manhattan socialite. Things are rocky in their relationship as Jeffries thinks she is \\"too perfect\\". But, naturally it's takes a murder to bring them together.<br /> \\"Rear Window\\" was quite a big hit when first released. Hitchcock was at a peak in his career when this was made. The movie was nominated for 4 Oscars including \\"Best Director\\". When is was made it was also the largest set on the Paramount lot. But, that doesn't stop the movie from having a big city feel to it. Here's a Hitchcock movie any true Hitchcock fan HAS to see.<br /> Bottom-line: Alfred Hitchock's best film. One of my all-time favorites. Great directing, great acting and chemistry betwwen Stewart and Kelly. Hitchcock at the top of his game.hcock at the top of his game.
B00004TL21|3.0|out of the three deftones cd's that are out this is not one of the better ones.  it is still good but just not as hard as some of there older stuff.  If you want hard Deftones then get &quot;Around the Fur&quot; which is a  better cd.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is an incredibale CD I listen to it all the time and in my car and all over the place.  My favorte song on is  &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;, don't get me worng &quot;Oops!..I Did It Again&quot; is also  a great song as well. It's just an all around kick ass CD
B00004TL21|4.0|I bought this CD the day it was released (after only hearing the single &quot;Change in the house of flies&quot;) and I must say I am very pleased.  The Deftones have changed the sound on this album to a softer, more  soothing sound, rather than that of it's previous &quot;Around the  Fur&quot; which featured heavier vibes and stronger sounds. I will be  honest, at first I was skeptical but now that I have listened to the CD all  the way through I really like it.  If you like the single off the album you  will probably like most of the songs.  My favorites are  &quot;street  carp&quot; &quot;knife prty&quot; and &quot;elite&quot;
B00003CXDV|3.0|The has-been cast of a cult science fiction series much like Star Trek are mistaken for real space warriors  by a group of aliens who need help fighting off an angry warlord and his troups.  Never quite as funny or  sharp as it could have been, and the good cast (especially Alan Rickman)  isn't used to its full advantage, but it's  amusing and enjoyable. Stars  Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver.
B0000029AP|5.0|Not only is Toys in the Attic probably Aerosmith's best record, it is also a hard rock essential. Of course there are the classics: Walk This Way and Sweet Emotion, but the whole CD is incredible as well. The title track is a  great fast song, and Big Ten Inch Record is hilarious, as well as  annoyingly catchy. The only song on Toys that is mediocre is You See Me  Crying. Other than that, Toys is a must have, and is even superior to  Rocks.
0792839730|5.0|This, friends, is a gigantic and extremely well-done big budget war film detailing the disastrous September 1944 Allied attempt to break out of the deadlock in France, and thereby dramatically shorten the winning of the  Second World War. Operation Market-Garden, the brainchild of British  Field-Marshall Montgomery was a very risky attempt to pull a large daylight  airborne lightning raid on several bridges in the Netherlands and by  capturing and holding them, provide the Allies with a superhighway into the  German heartland. It stars Sean Connery, Dirk Bogarde, Gene Hackman,  Michael Caine, and Anthony Hopkins in central roles.<br />Of course,  everything goes wrong, and the viewer is immediately sucked into the  absorbing drama associated with the individual men and women caught in the  trap of circumstance and history. It is an entertaining objective study in  the ways in which military egos and subjective interests of the military  hierarchy doom the individual soldiers in a desperate and vainglorious  attempt to prove themselves correct. The film fairly accurately depicts the  way in which these individual egos persist in prosecuting this military  action regardless of a number of warnings (and intelligence evidence) that  the strength of German forces in the area were in actuality much larger and  formative than the British hierarchy wanted to believe.<br />The film is well  worth watching, and is star-studded. Like another interesting war film ,  The Longest Day, it used the old Hollywood contract system to get everyone  from Robert Redford to James Caan to Lawrence Olivier to Elliot Gould small  parts in the enterprise. Hard to picture Redford getting wasted, and to  some extent this small criticism probably overstates the only bad news  about this brilliantly filmed true tale that is well acted, well scripted,  and very believable. So relax, amigo, because this is a wonderful if a bit  sobering and accurate depiction of the unpredictable fate of men at war,  and is a entertaining way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon learning more  about the duties, obligations, and frailties of ordinary men caught in the  politics, desperation and extraordinary circumstances called war. Enjoy!ar,  and is a entertaining way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon learning more  about the duties, obligations, and frailties of ordinary men caught in the  politics, desperation and extraordinary circumstances called war.

0716736241|3.0|Perhaps I didn't pay as much attention to the 2nd edition, but it seems to me that this 3rd edition of Shriver and Atkins is not as well written and contains more errors than its predecessor.  Or perhaps, the other author of  the previous two editions, Cooper Langford, was the best writer of the  three.<br />First, the good points.  I chose this book as the text for my 3rd  year inorganic courses because of the scope.  No other textbook out there  covers the same breadth of material.  Meissler/Tarr and Cotton/Wilkinson  both suffer from too heavy an emphasis on metal-based chemistry, which  doesn't help those of us teaching 2 half-courses in inorganic chemistry -  one on the main group, one on transition metals.  The material has been  kept current with examples from the (relatively) recent literature,  something other texts do not do well.<br />Now for the bad.  Atkin's books are  usually difficult to read, but at least they are rigourous and complete  (e.g., his Physical Chemistry, which I find an invaluable reference).   Unfortunately, in this book he does not improve his prose, and the  thoroughness is lacking, as well as the profusion of errors make it  difficult and confusing for the student.<br />What does this all mean?   Someone needs to write an inorganic text that is exactly this book, except  better written.  I will continue to use this text, but I will continue to  check all the other new ones in the hope of finding a better one.
6300246876|4.0|This is an intriguing and entertaining film, made by two separate and independent teams (one each in Japan and in the US) and lends itself to a fair and less biased presentation of the tragic, devastating, and sometimes  hapless events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese  restless and anxious to flex their military muscle after a period of  military expansion during the 1920s and 30s, are struggling to build an  imperial future, and with the British and Dutch then desperately  preoccupied with their own European problems with the Nazis, the only  nation standing in the way of their ambitions is the United States. With  military adventurism so influential in Japanese society at the time, the  hard-liners seize the stage, expand the Navy,  and prepare for war.<br />The  United States, meanwhile, is busy trying to figure out who, what, where and  when about the nature of Japanese intentions. Although not mentioned iun  the movie, the U.S. had decided to expand its navy because of the nature of  the Jaopanese threat, so the Japanese naval staff felt constrained to act  relatively quickly so as to preserve and take full advantage of their  tactical and strategic advantage over the American Pacific fleet. They knew  that in two or three years ours would become too real a threat to their  ambitions. Another reviewer said that if we had been more alert the war  could have been prevented, and I strongly disagree. Too many oars were  already in the water to turn around. But I do believe we could have been  much better prepared and lost fewer men, ships and time had we been more  alert and sanguine about the possibility of attack.<br />ALl that being  said, this is a fairly accurate account of the events and the attack  itself, although at the end you get the distinct impression that the  Japanese commander allowed only one wave of attackers to come in, and this  is not accurate. There were two distinct waves of attack at Pearl Harbor,  the second being more costly and less fruitful for the Japanese attack  force. Most of the battle scenes are well-done and quite realistic. All in  all, this is an excellent depiction of the attack, and I highly recommend  it.more costly and less fruitful for the Japanese attack  force.

Eu e todos os meus amigos adoramos o novo lbum. Do rock zen do lbum anterior  eles passaram para um estilo mais apocalptico -- no vi a letra, no sei  exatamente do que as msicas falam, mas parece -- principalmente nas  msicas 'Elite' e 'Knife Party'.

B00000729S|5.0|If you've never heard of the Monks before don't feel bad, because not many have. All the same this virtually unheard of and almost forgotten garage rock quintette diserve to be recognized as one of the most innovative and  exciting bands of the sixties. Black Monk Time is full political angst and  emotionl unsettlement driven by powerful raw rock and roll. While most  bands of this time sugar coated their music, the Monks provided a high  intensity, in your face persona that would not be seen again for another  ten years. Bands such as the Clash and the Buzzcocks ought to have tipped  their hats to these angry young men for playing it loud and proud. Black  Monk Time is the best collection of their songs that I have seen. I can  honestly say that after ownig it for two months, I still listen to it  everyday.
B00004TL21|5.0|wow. white pony rocks!  it is by far better than around the fur and adrenaline.  all the tracks are awesome.  you must have this if you are a deftones fan.
B00002MZ12|4.0|One thing I could not understand was the bad reviews this album got from                                     professional critics. <br />       Some of them trashed it saying &quot;it is too early for Morissette to do an     Unplugged&quot;. Why is is so? Sheryl Crow did hers very early in her  recording                     career, and so did the late Stevie Ray  Vaughan <br />     I'm not saying here that the album is fantastic. It is not.  However, it is a  departure from the strange &quot;Supposed Former  Infatuation Junkie&quot; released last   year. I am unable to listen to  that album too frequently, but her debut release      and Unplugged sound  fine to me to the point of listening to both of them                                             straight. <br /> Of course, Alanis is no Clapton. She  lacks,at 24, the maturity of creating whole     new versions to her songs.  &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; and &quot;Uninvited&quot; don't sound      much  different than their studio versions. Only &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and     &quot;Ironic&quot; used the Unplugged 'sound'to enhance it differently  for the listening                                             public. <br />    The new songs, are very welcome to the ear. This writer specially loved her   version to Sting's &quot;King of Pain&quot; (actually, that's how I  learned of the existence          of the album), and my wife is an  inconditional fan of the lyrically          meaningless(but musically rich)  &quot;No Pressure Over Cappuccino&quot; <br />   I'd say that this is an  Alanis album that surely does a repair job on her image    after  &quot;Junkie&quot;, which few fans were able to enjoy as fully as  &quot;Jagged Little      Pill&quot;. The overall sound is great too, even  though it is sometimes hard to  understand what she mutters between songs.  She was certainly not used to the                                         acoustic setting <br />       Bottom line: A great album, even if the listeneris not a fan of Alanis                                          Morissette.
B00004TL21|5.0|Buy it now! ...This is Deftones at their very best!   It may be a little more mellow than the last 2 but it is their best album yet!  Songs like Digital Bath and Change (In The House of Flies) will send shivers down  your spine when you hear them!  This is the album of the year!
0679746048|2.0|I bought this book because I thought it would provide some insight into the world of mental illness.  I was sorely disappointed.
B000002BSG|5.0|Lemme see, how can I describe this CD...  It's just amazing.  I wore out my first copy, so I just recently bought a 2nd one.  It's a great CD to listen to on a rainy day..or while driving in the car... shoot, let's just  say it's a great CD to listen to *anytime*. It's definitely a pick-me-up!  You've got all different kinds of music on it.  raggae, rock, pop, jazz...  etc.  Whatever kind of music floats your boat, you can probably find on  this CD.  My faves would probably be &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; (of  COURSE...) &quot;Alright&quot;  (just makes you want to dance) and  &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot;.  Oh! and &quot;Traveling Without Moving&quot; and  &quot;Drifting Along&quot;...actually, I should just say I love every song  on it. So...what're you waiting for? Get it, Get it NOW! Word of warning  though, don't loan your copy to any of your friends...you might not get it  back.
0688170528|4.0|I read this book in about two days.  I found myself staying up as late as I could to finish it.   It was a nice, easy read.  I look forward to reading more from Picoult.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is an excellent movie with an all star cast.  I wasn't real big on the Civil War until I saw this movie, I have seen it about 50 times and I still watch it.  Now, I can't read enough about the battle and the war  itself.  I recommend this for anyone who wants to become a Civil War buff.
6301969294|2.0|The one trait, in my mind, that keeps movies from being the greatest of art forms, in that they date so quickly. If you read a Tolstoy novel, or a Hemingway novel, or see a Van Gogh painting, or listen to a Bach concerto,  and someone told you it was created last year, it would be believable. But  movies date badly, as does the &quot;Fountainhead.&quot; The emotions of  those who saw it when it was released, are not the same for those who see  it now. And even if it were filmed today, it's a very contrived movie.  Howard Roark is an architect, for God's sake. But the movie treats him like  he's saving the world from the Ebola virus. That his one-man crusade is  THAT important. Read Tom Wolfe's FROM BAUHAUS TO OUR HOUSE for an overview  of the architectural movement this movie's plot is taken from. <br />I do like  Patricia Neal in this. I didn't read the book, so was not disappointed by  Gary Cooper's age. For me his being so long in the tooth helped me believe  he really felt his convictions. I mean, he's not far off from retirement  age in this movie, and he's still refusing to compromise for the sake of  financial security.<br />Incidentally, Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal had a  real-life love affair as a result of this movie. So the passion she shows  for him on screen is real. (Gary Cooper was incapable of showing passion!).
B00004TL21|4.0|This is such a great cd. I went out and got the very last copy of the black limited edition cd at my local best buy this morning. Its worth every cent. The cd is enhanced so its got a really spiffy program with pics,  movies, and even a  game.  If you are willing to spend a couple of extra  bucks and you're a die hard deftones fan, i think you should get the  limited edition cd which comes in red or black...most of them are probably  already gone, so if you're a deftones fan..i suggest you get it while its  available!
B000002IQW|5.0|This is my favorite Skid Row CD and if I were ever to appear on &quot;The List&quot; I would have to say its my number two pick of all time. Sebastian Bach has a voice that is amazing and captivating. No one has ever  even come close to his octive range with the exception of Jeff Keith of  Tesla. The songs that I enjoy most from this CD are In a darkened Room,  Wasted Time and Quicksand Jesus.
B00004TL21|5.0|The guys from Sacramento are back with a excellent album that really shows the beauty of Chino's voice. The album is melodic and envelopes you in as your speakers pulse with buzzsaw guitars and a singer that has a range that  will knock on your feet. Listen to the last track &quot;Pink Maggit&quot;  and you'll understand what I talking about. This album also reveals that  the Deftones are moving away from the whole rap-metal genre and developing  into their own sound. Keep up the good work guys.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I never used to like Britney Spears and refused to support her but the release of the infectious &quot;Oops...I Did It Again!&quot; got me hooked. It ultimately led to me purchasing both of her albums and I love them.  &quot;Oops...&quot; shows that Britney is maturing as an artist and is a  perfect example of pure pop music. From the funky beat of the anthem  &quot;Stronger&quot; to the Shania Twain penned ballad &quot;Don't Let Me  Be The Last To Know&quot;, &quot;Oops...&quot; shows that while Britney may  not have a voice like Christina Aguilera she still reigns supreme as the  Queen of Pop. Her mixture of formulaic pop and catchy melodies is  irresistable and confirms Britney to be one of the best young artists  around. Two thumbs up!
B00004TH83|5.0|I love Lara Fabian and I think the cd is very good .As her first cd I think she did a great job .You will be amazed to hear a voice send by God when you listen each song on this cd .Some songs will make you fall in love  ,some will make you cry and some will give you the energy to dance .It's a  great cd and you wont be dissaointed at all .Welcome the new Streisand of  the new millenium .She is far better then Celine Dion .
6305657939|4.0|It is certainly refreshing to see an action/romance movie that treats its audience as if they had IQs above those of the average rutabaga.  There are a handful of times when something just &quot;isn't right&quot; about the film--a mangled reference to time zones, for instance--but in general the  viewer is able to admire the wit and urbanity of the title character, his  antagonist..., and indeed the writer who created the  characters.<br />The love affair is a little contrived, and the film seems to  be trying too hard to convince us of the sexual electricity between the  very attractive lead couple of Brosnan and Russo.  Their relationship  occasionally boils but seldom simmers.  But the acting (Dennis Leary  aside--and I disliked him here less than I usually do) is solid throughout,  and the art-theft plot coheres very well.  <br />I haven't seen the original  McQueen/Dunaway film, but I was reminded of the classic &quot;It Takes a  Thief.&quot;  This movie isn't as good, but being mentioned in the same  breath with a classic of the genre isn't bad.
B0000026VZ|5.0|I loved Toto in the 1980s and I love them more now.  It's refreshing to go back in time once in a while and listen to old favorites like Hold the Line, Rosanna, Pamela, I Won't Hold You Back, 99.  If you miss 80s music  like I do, buy this CD.
0440234743|2.0|This is the second Grisham book I read. It is an entertaining page-turner, but as a Brazilian, I was set back by Grisham's inaccurate, sensationalist and rather prejudiced portrait of Brazil. He makes &quot;Pantanal&quot;,  which is where most of the story takes place, seems like hell. Pantanal is  the Portuguese word for swamp and it is also a beautiful ecological  sanctuary. Okay, &quot;The Testament&quot; is fiction, but too much  exaggeration makes the story loose credibility. I also thought that the end  could have been better elaborated. He builds up a good suspense, but he  lets the reader down in the end.  If you are a big Grisham fan,the book is  still worth reading despite its shortcomings. If not, I would recommend  picking another book.
B00004U8PA|5.0|This collector's edition should be the ultimate edition for this cult classic!  Here's your chance to talk back to the tv, and no one will think it's strange!  Fabulous extras like the Audience Participation soundtrack  and deleted scenes will delight any movie buff.  I love this movie, and  love this dvd.
B00001R3GI|5.0|At first listen - nearly 30 years ago- I wasn't overly impressed by the album.  Like another reviewer I thought there was a bit too much filler and not enough landmark stuff like you will find on &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;  or &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;.  Over the years, however, and after repeated  listenings I've grown to appreciate the sheer gritiness and force of the  thing and recognized its subsequent influence on all that's followed.   Buried among the obvious classics like &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;,  &quot;Happy&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot; are some pretty tasty  lesser nuggets like &quot;Loving Cup&quot;, &quot;Sweet Black Angel&quot;,  &quot;All Down the Line&quot;, and &quot;Shine a Light&quot; - all of which  hold up pretty damn well against anything today's mediocre talent pool has  to over.  If you don't believe me, just ask my nine year old daughter -  she's always trying to make off with my copy.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I really enjoyed Fight Club.  I do not think it was overly violent.  The violence that was displayed in the movie was definately neccessary to the movie's overall premise. Edward Norton does an absolutely excellent job  portraying our narrator (&quot;Jack&quot;).  His internal conflict at his  life is obvious as we pan through his condo - with price tags on everything  visible.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is his single-serving friend who brings  this conflict to light.  The movie progresses &amp; I won't spoil the plot  as others have done - other than to say - I just loved this movie.  Helena  Bonham Carter plays the trashy Marla wonderfully.  She finally takes a  break form all of those period flicks!<br />The DVD itself - I give it 5  stars.  It has got so many extras on the supplemental disc - I still  haven't gone through them all.  I am definately looking forward to  finishing it though!<br />Your money WILL NOT BE WASTED on this DVD.  I am so  glad I bought it.  Be sure to check out the deleted scenes!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I enjoyed this classic when I was a child growing up. When I became a  Mother and had a chance to buy it on VHS I did so. My 3little girls each  have there favorite parts: the adorable little mushrooms, the fairies, the  swans. I can especially relate to the waltzing hippo: if she can do it so  can I! The musical score is excellent. The visuals are clean. I even found  out that my craddle-robbing husband has his favorite scene and score. This  film is a unique way of introducing one to the innocent and simple - very  imaginable - world of life. After all, if we must be on this journey of  life why not make it pleasurable.
B00004TL21|5.0|This is up there with their other CD's.  The Song done with Maynard is AWSOME.
B0000027I6|5.0|For those of you who agree that the Final Cut is the best of all the Floyd Albums, this is the logical follow up to that LP.  Unlike &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; and &quot;Kaos&quot; where Waters desperately tries to distance  himself from the Floyd sound, he has returned home here.  This album is  nothing short of a masterpiece--albeit a bleak view of the world. Much like  the Final Cut, this album requires a few listenings to accept it, but once  you do, it will be the one CD you never remove from the CD changer in your  car.  Incidentally, I saw Waters on his current (June 2000) tour and this  is the only solo album from which he plays songs during the concert.   Phenomenal!
B00003CWL5|3.0|To be honest I really didn't understand this movie. I was quite confused by all the supposed subtexts and layers of the various characters. But one aspect of the film that really touched me, as an adult homosexual, were the  scenes involving the (apparently) gay-hating father and how he treats his  son, only to learn that he has lived a life of pain hiding his own  homosexuality. I can relate to this. Although not in the military, I've had  to deal with the pain and internal conflict of dealing with my  homosexuality in a homo-hating world. It's not easy, but like the charcter  in the movie, I often deal with things similarly - lashing out, criticizing  others, trying to make up for my own shortcomings. What a powerful  characterization. I recommend this movie to all gay (and of course  straight) men.
6305014140|5.0|With the growing number of anime releases on DVD, and its inevitable increase in popularity, I am often posed with the question of where to start watching anime on DVD.  My answer is always, &quot;Get Ninja  Scroll.&quot;  In my mind, Ninja Scroll is the perfect introduction to  anime because it stands on its own as a great movie, not just great anime.  Anyone, anime-fan or not, can enjoy it.  It has a classic storyline  including a pair of strangers cooperating (albeit often in conflict with  each other) to defeat a series of increasingly difficult enemies.  With a  touch of humor, a dash of sex, a twisting plotline, and generous amounts of  action/violence, Ninja Scroll is a very well-rounded and compelling  view.<br />So, if you need to know where to start your anime DVD collection,  or if you've already started and need to know where to go next, look no  further.  Ninja Scroll is THE must-buy anime DVD.
B00001U03Q|2.0|If you want a good CD that is solid and you can listen to more than once, go buy Cream Of Clapton.  It represent Clapton during his years with the supergroup Cream and also when he went solo.  Cream of Clapton is a great  CD and is my favorite.  All the songs on this so called best of CD are  nothing to compare to his early work.  And to the guy that said that a lot  of people weren't born when he wrote Layla, well no one alive was born when  Beethoven wrote Fur Elise.
B00004TL21|4.0|Few things will surprise you and then you relax.  enter drums and focused atmosphere.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|If you enjoyed Apple's first album, this one will just knock you off your feet.  Her witty wordplay was what kept me hooked in the first place on &quot;Tidal,&quot; but this album is ten times more than &quot;Tidal.&quot;  It's as if &quot;Tidal&quot; put the knife in and &quot;When the  Pawn&quot; twists it for effect.  Her emotions are extremely evident in  this album, and you can't help but feeling the same after listening to it.  I bought it as soon as it was released but never REALLY listened to it  until this summer...and I was stupid to wait.  Even if you DIDN'T like  Fiona's first CD, give this one a chance.  You'll be addicted from the  get-go.
B00004TL21|5.0|I thought this was a really good CD. The musiuc and the lyrics are stronger than the Deftones' debut album, &quot;Around the Fur.&quot; This new album should make the Deftones more noticeable in the music industry.
B00004TL21|5.0|What can I say?  I was blown away by this.  Everything flowed together perfectly.  I was afraid they'd lose something when I heard that this would be completely different from their old works.  However, the complete  opposite is true.  They do something truly special here, mixing elements of  their two previous works and yet doing something totally abstract from the  previous albums.<br />The album starts off well and only builds up from there.   Each song is different, but coalesces with the others so that there is a  definite flow.  From the heavy Elite to the beautiful Teenager everything  here comes together perfectly.<br />It's hard to pick a favorite song, because  I like each one, but I was especially pleased with Passenger, Digital Bath,  and Knife Party.
B00004SYWZ|4.0|Great pop album with substance, check out the sureal VELVET
0449911357|4.0|This novel is a fine historical view of The South. Fannie Flagg introduces two women in the Mid 1980's. One is an overweight housewife named Evelyn Couch. The other is an elderly woman in Rose Terrace Retirement Home named  Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode.    Mrs. Threadgoode enthralls Evelyn with the tales  of life in the small railroad community of Whistle Stop,Alabama.In so  doing, we are introduced to colorful characters like Idgie,Ruth,Sipsey, and  Big George. We hear about their lives, and adventures through several ways.  Flagg either tells their tales from a firsthand point of view, or uses the  local &quot;Newspaper&quot; called THE WEEMS WEEKLY, published by Busybody  postal worker Dot Weems. Either way, the tales are wonderful, and  well-written. I suggest this book for anyone who wants to be swept away  into a great work of Southern Literature.
014028009X|5.0|It is not possible to not want to read this entire book cover to cover in one sitting.  It is absolutely hilarious, as well as including situations to which real women can relate.  I took this book with me to Spain for the  long plane ride over and the many train rides I would take throughout the  country, and this book proved a wonderful companion.  I would read it over  and over again!  If you're looking for real, honest, and comical fiction,  Bridget Jones' Diary has it all.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This CD is a waste of plastic. A waste of money, and a waste of time. Please do not buy this because it really stinks. just because she is not afraid to wear a bra in a music video and not wear a bra on a kids TV show,  she is popular. It's sick she is so untalented.
B00004TL21|4.0|i just finished listening to this cd and it left me wanting more.good songs a lil more melodic than the last but still the deftonesit sounds a lil more refined cleaner but is thatwhat i want from the deftones? they  still have a lot of power. bottom line not as heavy but still a good cd.
0671682474|5.0|This book is essentially a collection of short narrative about the struggles of various Native American cultures in what became the United States. The book is written from the perspective of the Native Americans,  and thus has a different emphasis than many of today's high school U.S.  History texts (at least not the same emphasis as mine had). I really  enjoyed the reading. It was new to hear the side of the story we almost  never consider. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B000002UCQ|5.0|This album is brilliant. It shows how talented Harrison really was and demonstrates how under-rated he was/is as a musician and song writer. The onl problem with this CD is that it desperately needs to be remastered. In  this time when nearly everything is being remastered (Bowie, Pink Floyd,  Lennon and Beatles) this CD needs it too. Perhaps if the sound quality was  up to modern standards it would reach a new height of popularity - it  certainly deserves a wider recognition as one of the greatest musical  moments in the history of popular music.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Don't worry about what Britney's new CD sounds like.  You probably already know.  It's full of the same bubble gum pop and nasal tones as the last one.  And if you're not sick of it already, this album will make you run to  the toilet.  &quot;Oops&quot; showcases, yet again, Britney's lack of vocal  range and singing ability.  However, there are quite beautiful pictures of  the untalented little girl in the album's insert, giving the impression  that on THIS album she grew up...then you put it in your CD player and find  out she, like everything else associated with her, was just utilizing false  advertising.  Her most horrible mistake is her monotone cover of The  Rolling Stones' &quot;I Can't Get No Satisfaction,&quot; in which she  positively butchered a classic.  This CD is better for a coaster or a  frisbee for the dog, if you want to spend that much money.
6303168507|5.0|&quot;Schindlers List&quot; was one of the most emotional movie i have ever seen. The way that the inhumane Nazis terrified the Jews and murdered them without a reson. And Oscar Schindler is a good example of a hero, to  have sacraficed so much to sve so little compared to the 6 million who  perished under the Nazi rule.
B000002WCJ|5.0|Although there're many years between 1988 and today, it's worth talking (and listening!) about this LP. In fact, I got a question: who has never heard about this LP?<br />Absolutely this is for me the BEST German Metal  album ever created. This is a LP everybody should have in their particular  collection of records. If you talk about German Metal, you must talk about  this  &quot;Keeper of the seven keys - Part II&quot;. Not only because its  high musical quality but also because of the influence this band (and  particularly this album) has had in other ones. <br />The beginning cannot be  better, with an instrumental introduction that ends into &quot;Eagle fly  free&quot;, one of the best Helloween songs. But this is not the only one,  the LP is full of great songs: there's no boring one, believe me; it's a  PERFECT album. And the way it ends is also amazing: &quot;The keeper of the  seven keys&quot;: the best of the best. I can still remember the summer of  9 years ago when I listened to it  almost twice each day... and all I can  say is I didn't get bored! Still today when I listen to it I amuse as if  I've just dicovered it a week ago.<br />If you have never listened to this  jewel, what are you waiting for?  You will get amazed with the best voice  of Metal: Michael Kiske in 1988...  need say more? Just listen to it, and  maybe then you'll realize.
B000006045|5.0|This CD is marvellous. But nearly everyone seems to already know this by now. Almost anything can de said about this CD - but it really should be all positive. &quot;Teardrop&quot; and &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot; are  nearly enough to make this a must buy in themselves, but really the entire  album is worth listening to. There is no point in raving about this album's  brilliance, all you need to know is that you should listen repeatedly to  this album at the very least.
B00004TL21|5.0|They have done it again, the Deftones are still making choice music, if you don't buy it your missing out!
0060207051|5.0|&quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; is a magical time with your children.  And that all depends on how you are reading the story.  As rabbit begins his journey to sleep so does our journey into his room.  We begin with reading in a  normal volume and point out where the moon is in the window and always ask  &quot;Where's the mouse?&quot;  <br />As the rabbit's room darkens our voices  become softer and softer until we are whispering for our children to notice  the postion of the moon, the growing darkness in the &quot;great, green  room,&quot; and always whispering &quot;Where's the mouse?&quot;  <br />This  is one of those all time childhood favorites that we read with as much  drama as my grandmother put into the story when she read &quot;Goodnight  Moon&quot; to me back in the early sixties.  As a child it drew me to  comforting sleep and I always delighted in finding that tiny creature in  the pages of the room when my grandmother asked &quot;Where's the  mouse?&quot;<br />Your children too will someday ask their children  &quot;Where's the mouse?&quot;
B00003CXDV|5.0|This film is very funny. I am sure the the actors had a great time playing their parts. It shows on screen. This film is not only a spoof on the original Star Trek series and its cast, but on sci fi conventions in  general. You will be laughing all through this.
B00004TL21|2.0|The deftones are a decent band. I have always found them to bequite over rated. They constanitly have been called a korn knock offby some or this phenomical genius of a band by some. to me they are just another knock off of korn.  I have been a fan of both bands for about 5 years now so iam not some (edit) who watches T.R.L. Adrenaline was a great alblum so was around the fur.  This alblum is comparable with korn 1998 alblum follow the leader in that they are trying for radio suppourt. It's defaniatly not a limp bizkit record which is good. it does have a few good songs but it's just another sell out alblum
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Savage Garden's &quot;Affirmation&quot; is a great cd- songs like &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, &quot;Crash and Burn&quot;, and &quot;The Animal Song&quot; are great singles, and my personal favorite, &quot;You Can Still  be Free&quot;, is very emotional and uplifting. However, after about a  week, I grew a little sick of some of the songs. In other words, they  become very boring- very fast. However, that's the only problem I have with  their cd. It's not even my type of music- I am definitely an alternative  girl. But I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who wants a break from  hard rock and rap. If you're in one of those peaceful, amiable moods and  you want something peaceful and amiable to listen to, this cd is PERFECT.  Try not to listen to it all the time when you first buy it, though. You  might lose interest in a couple days.
0790734850|4.0|I was not alive in the 1950's,I have never been to Los Angeles, or anywhere else in California for that matter. So I have a hard time explaining why this film makes me feel like I'm in 1950's Hollywood.  &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; had the unfortunate timing of being released  at the same time as &quot;Titanic&quot; and was grossly overlooked. This  movie has all the essential elements of a great story: greed, lust, power,  corruption, sex, and drugs.  In L.A. Confidential there seems to be no  absolute black and white, only people living their lives in different  shades of gray. No character seems to be all good or all bad, but they all  have their own since of morality. Jack Vinncines (Kevin Spacey) is the  narcotics detective knee-deep in the glitz and glamopur of Holloywood,  rubbing elbows with the rich and powerful. Ed Exley, the son of fallen  department hero, determined to fulfill his dreams of being a detective, no  matter the cost. Bud White (Russell Crowe), the muscle bound thug cop  obsessed with protecting abused women, and longing for the day he can use  his brain to work a case instead of his fists. Each cop sets forth on a  journey in seemingly different directions, all coming together in a web of  deception and corruption. Kim Bassinger is outstanding as the glamorous  prostitute cought in the middle, and James Cromwell (probably the best  actor you don't know) is terrific as Captain Dudley Smith. Many want to  label &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; as a great example of flim noir, but I  say that is just a great film. It's dark and full of realism, and a  movie  that has been over looked far too long.
6305609691|5.0|A great adaptation of Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart ofDarkness... into the Vietnam War.  This film is so powerful on many levels; as a war-film, a film of the craziness of war, the insanity of violence, the  god-worship nature of people, the limits of mankind.  Truly one of the  classic films of all time.<br />The DVD offers some interesting bonuses, such  as the original filming of the destruction of the Kurtz compound in  Cambodia.  If anything, it goes to show you how a great director like  Coppola was smart enough to take this out of the original in order to leave  a more powerful message in the ending than simple mass destruction.
0316777722|5.0|What a really fun book. If you can say that a book about a man obsessed with dermatological ailments and a very healthy fantasy life is 'fun'. It's sick, silly, twisted and charming. Well worth buying in hardback and that,  for me, is saying something. My favorite line was 'You saw people smoking  in resturaunts? In offices too? Oh, tell me again about the ashtrays in the  hospital waiting rooms? And don't leave anything out&quot;.
B000003AEB|5.0|Aight,  I never got over how good this CD wuz,  even though itz an old CD,  just like Dre's Tha Chronic,  dis CD iz a pure classic.  It haz phat beatz (1 star),  Good Lyrics (1),  This song iz still good (1),  itz old school  (1),  itz also gangsta rap (1),  datz five starz,  itz worth ur money,  I  know dat.  Dis CD I cannot stop listenin to,  Track 10 iz a song not to be  forgotten.  I wish Old School and Gangsta rap wuz still tha biggest,  cuz  Old School mixed wit Gangsta Rap makes tha best combination EVER.  Snoop  Dogg'z Debut CD wuz also tha Debut of a revolution.  This CD u wont be able  to put down.  Five Starz no doubt.  Get it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|A film that is unfairly maligned for being overly violent. It has probably  been put in this basket because of the questions it asks of many of our  societal values. Whatever the case it is a very enjoyable movie to watch  but you have probably made that decision already.<br />Is the DVD worth buying  ? DEFINITLEY. The movie lends itself to multiple viewings (I believe it  gets better after the first viewing) and DVD is the perfect medium for this  -  Great quality visuals and a very interesting soundtrack that makes good  use of a surround sound setup. (also good in 2CH stereo)<br />The extras are  also very interesting. The commentary tracks are all worth listening to,  offering an insight into the thematic choices made (Fincher, Brad Pitt, Ed  Norton, Helena BC track, Screenwriter/author track, Fincher solo track),  the special effects(Track 4, Fincher solo) and just some funny stories from  the set.(All tracks) <br />The second disc of extras will keep you busy as  well. It offers a number of insights into how special effects were used to  dramatic effect. Multi-angle is used here but I didn't find this aspect as  useful. I just watched the clips through twice, once on each angle. Also  included are some removed scenes with comparisons and explanations on why  they were not there.<br />I would have liked a longer documentary on the  second disc but I'm getting picky now.<br />Fight Club on DVD is topped off by  the BEST packaging for a DVD that I have ever seen. Very attractive and  also functional.<br />If you liked the movie you have to own this DVD.
B000006ZL4|5.0|The day that I received this CD is the day that Dream Theater's &quot;Awake&quot; fell to the #2 slot on my personal list for greatest metal CD of all-time in any genre.  I tend to be very critical and don't  dish out too many 5-stars, but this CD  deserves it.  It is  flawless...seriously.  Let me start with the vocalist - Russel Allen.  He  is right there with DC Cooper and Ralf Scheepers as the best vocalist in  metal.  His voice as described in other reviews does sound like Dio at  times and operatic in others.  His voice is so good that it literally  floats in songs such as &quot;The Accolade&quot; and &quot;Divine Wings of  Tragedy.&quot;  Russel has a tremendous sense of melody and what notes to  hit especially given Michael Romeo's unique rhythm guitar style.  Speaking  of this style, Michael Romeo can get more out of playing the same chord  over and over again than any guitarist I've ever heard.  In just about  every song, it is Russel's voice that creates the melody.  You won't find  many traditional riffs on this CD.  As for the songs, they are all top  notch.  If there is a better epic than &quot;The Accolade&quot;, then I'd  love to hear it.  (Actually, if I have to pick a flaw this song contains it  because for some reason Russel's voice is slightly drowned out by the  instruments, but this is being nitpicky) &quot;Candlelight Fantasia&quot;  is a tremendous &quot;power ballad&quot; that easily surpasses the cheesy  ballads put out in the 80's.  All in all, this is a must-have by any metal  fan whether your the prog type or power type or both.  This is the CD that  all others I purchase from here on in will be compared to.  (Interestingly,  I actually had a 50+ year old doctor come over to my car asking me who this  CD was because he wanted to play this during his operations.  He actually  used the words &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;medieval&quot; to describe the  music.)
0800141806|2.0|You really can't make a movie about &quot;being gay,&quot; or, more pointedly, &quot;being-gay-and-discriminated-against&quot; and not have the movie judged primarily as an agenda-flick, especially when the characters  are as two-dimensional as they are in this story.  Tom Hanks plays a gay  man who for a brief, sad time in his life was sexually promiscuous.  He  caught AIDS.<br />His character doesn't work--he is a stereotype, or,  rather, what the filmmakers would *like* to be a stereotype, I think:  the  sensitive, intelligent, put-upon Gay Man.  His employers, who fire him  immediately upon finding out he is gay and has AIDS, are stereotypical  Villains.  They seem to have very little to talk about (particularly around  poor Tom Hanks!) other than gays, which of course they do in a coarse and  insensitive manner.  They are the Cold-Hearted Homophobes.<br />Denzel  Washington is Hanks' lawyer, the Homophone-Who-Becomes-More-Human by  knowing the Gay Man.<br />Sound puerile?  It is.  What the filmmakers have  failed to realize is that if you REALLY want to present a human drama, you  can't keep the characters as two-dimensional as they are in Philadelphia.  Hanks needs to be more than a Sensitive Gay Man.  Jason Robards needs to be  more than the Cruel Homophobe.  And so on.  In real life, people aren't  that simple.  This kind of b&amp;w morality works in Hollywood adventure  movies, but it doesn't work in art.<br />In addition to ignoring the  complexities of human character, this movie totally ignores the complexites  of the AIDS issue, and gay rights, simplifying them into a thin gruel of  unthinking, maudlin, propaganda.  This movie is a tearjerker if all you  want is to have your position on the AIDS/Gay issue confirmed, but sorry  mistake if you expect something with aesthetic merit, or thought-provoking  content.
B00000IMCW|5.0|the movie the matrix is one of the best movies i've ever seen. one time i was eating this sandwhcich and my friend down the street came over and i got the stuff from my sanwhich over my lap. he said when he was coming over  he say someone that looked like the guy down the stret.  the one with a  limp.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Forget about the TV show, this movie is the real MASH.  There is an edge to the characters and story that is totally lacking in the series.  If it is episodic and without structure, that appears to be the nature of most  wars.  The acting and writing are top class, with Frank Burns, for example,  emanating a real sense of menace, not a harmless buffoon. Robert Altman  defined a whole new way of filming that has been used in film and TV on  numerous series. For those of you who saw the series before the film,  sorry, but it appears to have ruined your ability to appreciate a great  work of art.
B00004TL21|4.0|The new Deftones is really good. A lot of the songs are extremely well written, and it shows that the band has come quite away since their last success &quot;Around the Fur.&quot; This is probably one of the best CD's  to come out this year.
B00004TL21|5.0|Once again Deftones have given birth to another amazing album &quot;White Pony&quot;. This Cd is so powerful and expressive that you will want to hear every Song! I would recommend this to anyone who loves great sounds  and powerful lyrics. BUY THIS CD!
B00004T6V4|5.0|Not to gush - but - Still Crazy is my favorite movie!  I waited for what seemed like FOREVER to receive this soundtrack, but it was more than worth the wait.  As soon as I heard the opening notes of The Flame Still Burns I  was just carried away with happiness.  And I defy anyone not to want to  jump around and dance crazily to All Over the World!  I am SO in love with  this movie and music!  If you are even as marginally infatuated with Still  Crazy as I am, this CD will put you in a wonderfully happy mood, make you  wistful and, if you're like me, make you not want to ever stop listening to  it.  Gush, Gush, Gush...
6305558167|5.0|Excalibur has long been one of my favorite films, filled with mystery, action, and a sense of visual magic that few films have achieved to capture. Excalibur is a dazzing re-telling of the legend of King Arthur and  his kingdom. Nigel Terry makes a dashing and noble King Arthur. From his  time as a young squire who pulls the legendary sword from the stone to his  final battle, Terry captures the noble essence of the destined and  conflicted King.  Nicol Williamson is memorable as the mercurial wizard  Merlin. Helen Mirren as the sinister and wicked Morgana, Cheri Lunghi is  Guinivere and Nicholas Clay as Lancelot. Also featured in the cast are Liam  Neeson, Patrick Stewart and Gabriel Byrne.<br />John Boorman really creates  the definative cinematic tale of King Arthur. The visual atmosphere is  breathtaking, both dark and foreboding and teeming with brilliant colors.  The Production design is simply awe inspiring and really takes the viewer  to another time and place. The original music by Trevor Jones and music of  legendary composer Richard Wagner perfectly captures the mystery and larger  than life adventures of King Arthur and the knights of the round table.  <br />This DVD edition is overall quite excellent. The picture and sound  quality is excellent and includes John Boorman's commentary about the  making of this powerful film.  My only quibble is the the changing of the  cover art. The original and evocotive illustration has been replaced in  favor of a rather lame and uninspiring photo composite.
6305903182|1.0|How can Scream 3 with it's serial killer subject be funny. How can they do  that? It's bad enough that they made Scream 2 but Scream 3 was way too  much. They classifed this movie as comedy/horror. Yeah right, I did not  laugh or jump up once. What gives? I mean don't get me wrong, I loved the  original Scream but this 3rd film is so lame, it's not even funny. I  actually siked myself out saying that Scream 3 was gonna be good. I went in  hoping for the best and the worst came out. It's really sad to see high  class actors starring in such a low class film. Nearly everyone that has  written a review of this movie is saying it's good and you might fall for  it. Please. Oh please take my advise and do not see this film. Avoid it at  all causes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I can't believe that  I actually have to give this peice of garbage a star.<br />P.S. To anyone that  has seen the film. At the end where Neve sees something and ignores it and  walks away. . .that's what every charater lacked doing throughout the  trilogy and look at the mess that they got themselves into.
B00004TL21|4.0|This CD is hard driving but with insight into social issues. The guitar sound is different than you here anywhere else.
0783241569|1.0|Okay, this is a clear example of a movie with great actors and actresses but a weird plot. Actually, I can't tell you much about his movie because I fell asleep. Yep, I did! I watched it but it just got soo boring.; You  people out there LOVE Julia Roberts but just because she's in a movie  doesn't make it good. This was a lame excuse for a movie that would  hopefully sell a lot of tickets by getting Julia ROberts in it. It was not  very good at all. And there was no earthly way to understand it. Who cares  if you don't understand my review, I don't understant Notting Hill!
B00001QGK4|5.0|Bought the video, &quot;Black and White Night&quot; and this CD equally jams.  Orbison gets together with a few of his friends--Springsteen, kd lang, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, JD Souther, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits,  T. Bone Burnett, and Jackson Browne.  <br />These artists perform with the  Coconut Grove Band live in concert to most of Orbison's classics.   Springsteen and Orbison get into some friendly guitar riffs, lang, Raitt  and Warnes provide backup vocals.  The result is a timeless classic--a  unique evening of entertainment.<br />Buy the CD, buy the videotape.  You'll  definitely want both.  (Plus you can look at the audience and find those  famous faces.)
B00000IQV7|5.0|This is a great movie.  I loved it because it had Robin Williams in it and even though it was a very serious movie, he added a touch of class and humor to it.  I think this is one of the most serious films he's ever done  and this is a great movie to see if you haven't seen it already.
B0000256VK|5.0|My music collection keeps ballooning as I get older and my tastes diverge radically...  But this recording is one of those that really hits home.  The mood it sets, the subtle layering, the smoldering intensity lurking  just under the surface...  I'm eternally grateful to an ex-girlfriend for  introducing me to this CD ten years ago.  It's a perfect backdrop for  anything from a quiet dinner to having friends over to writing poetry or  drawing.  And then there are the times when I just sit and close my eyes  and let the pictures form in the mind's eye.  Now I see that there is a  remastered edition and I'm thinking about buying it to see if it will take  me even farther.  I can guarantee that it will take you on a journey as  well if you stop and listen...
B00004R7X5|4.0|The only reason that I don't give this recording a full 5 stars is the sound.  Although, the Original Bit Image Processing that DG has used to restore this performance is quite successful, the recording still fails to  have a full sound in the lower sounds like the rolling of the tympani and  the pounding of the bass drums.  Also, somewhat problematic is the cymbal  crashing.  They don't ring as fully as on more modern recordings.  Having  said that, the spirit of the piece is incredible.  I must say the violin  solos by the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic are among the best  I've heard.  Such challenging notes are hard to bring off beautifully and  in this recording they shine brightly and bring a whole new meaning to the  Symphonic Suite.  In fact, I understood more fully who Scheherazade was  when I heard the violin solos.  The conducting on this piece is superb.  Jessy Norman once said that Herbert von Karajan creates a magic carpet for  a singer.  It is true whether there is a singer on that carpet or just a  listener.  His ability to take you to another place through his conducting  is truly amazing.  Knowing that von Karajan made numerous recordings of  various pieces, I am suprised he never made a digital recording of this  piece.  Perhaps, it is because he felt there was nothing more to say.
0316286869|4.0|Making Faces is an excellent book. However, it might not be what you expect. This book is wonderful provided you are looking for something a little more outlandish, extravagant, or theatrical. It focuses on color,  mood, and the art of makeup. Making Faces also has sections devoted to:  shadowing,(the use of light and dark to make features appear slimmer or  bolder) as well as a method to change eyebrow shape,(with the use of wax  and heavy makeup) and other professional techniques. If you expect to find  more than a display of Kevin's work, some rather interesting aproaches to  beauty, and quite a few beautifully artistic photographs, this book may not  be what you want. Yet, if you'd like a change or a different perspective in  the world of makeup, go for it!
B00000ICD9|5.0|I saw this movie and was touched greatly.  I was very suprised at how well it was done, and this is one of those films where Robin Williams does a great job acting serious instead of comical like he usually does.  It has  some rather strange parts in it...but it is a great film and I would highly  recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
B00001SIES|4.0|Like almost everyone else reviewing this album, there is a striking similarity between Radiohead's songs and a handful of Muse's.  Many parts in the album are very well done, and I am moved deeply by quite a few of  their songs, including &quot;Unintended&quot; and the opening track  &quot;Sunburn&quot;.  Other songs however do lack a little something that  I'm sure can be fixed over time.  But after hearing the first album, I'm  anxious to hear more, as I am sure Muse will grow in their creativity with  the more music they create.  An excellent start, and a very wise buy to  anyone who enjoys hearing a new creative sound.
6305750750|4.0|So what if it's written for children.  Who cares that the story line is an exact replica of previous Star War's installments.  It does not matter that the acting, the jokes, the script, and the characters are sub par.  This  video is all about letting &quot;everything go&quot; and immersing yourself  in an eye catching thrill ride.  Looking for holes in this moving is like  looking for holes in a screen door.  This is a movie you watch for pure  pleasure.  Just revel in the fantasy, enjoy this classic story, and forget  about trying to find imperfection.
6305657947|5.0|I thought it was full of action but it also had an underlying story: something almost unheard of if you compare it to movies like MI-2.<br />The actors were right for the part and the whole product was incredibly  entertaining.
6303521320|4.0|spectacular action
B000006O7C|4.0|A lot of this album makes for uneasy listening, but is essential nonetheless to any fan of Jeff's, as there are more stand out moments on these two discs than on many other artists entire discography.<br />But while  listening to Disc 2 compare the twisted, dark soul at work on the 1997  tracks with the pure, uncluttered soul on 'Satisfied Mind' (recorded 1992).   I don't think there can be any clearer indication of where he was at  mentally after the heavy touring he had been doing.  Just before he died he  had begun to do unadvertised unannounced solo shows with just his voice and  guitar to try to regain his focus.<br />It would be nice to think these shows  had managed to satisfy his mind once more.
B00004TL21|4.0|...who gives a f**c, pony is still very good. Intensive, emotional and sh*t like that.
B00001IVOR|5.0|To put it frankly. This album has nine of the best emcees to ever grace the planet, put together on a double disc album, where their chemistry is uncanny, every single flow is just jaw dropping, the beats are ridiculously  brilliant. Wu-Tang Forever.
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones kicked it again. Starting with their Adrenaline which sported a fair amount of melody and distorsion, over Around the Fur which displays what chaos can be, to White Pony Deftones show an amount of maturity over  their years of growth. White Pony is softer than Around the Fur (example:  DaiTheFlu in Around the Fur). The Maynard from Tool appears in one song (i  think Passanger) and adds Tool's dark and cryptic feeling. Lyrics stay the  melody tool, their meaning put behind their audio experience. White Pony is  something any fan of heavier music must have in his collection, and also  breaks the myth that Deftones are &quot;girly&quot; music. Boys, kick it in  with White Pony.
0440219078|5.0|I've read The Giver a few times to Grade 4 students and they love it. While only a few kids that age could read it independently, it's one of those books that seems to lift students up to its level of sophistication  and helps them mature by seeing our culture with a little removedness.  <br />Set in the future, it gives a horrifying glimpse into  &quot;perfection&quot;. With everything safe and controlled, there's no  tolerance or allowance for error, for real feelings, for true thought. It's  a very colourless place! In fact, people have lost their ability to see  colour -- all except for a few. Jonas is one of them, although at first he  catches only brief glimpses and doesn't know what it is, just that for a  moment something looks &quot;different&quot;. This is one of the very  powerful, sublte threads of the plot, the discovery that this different  look to things is actually colour. The reader doesn't know for a very long  time that this perfect world is in fact colourless, and when it finally is  revealed, my students are always shocked! (sorry if I'm giving away some  plot, but if you're a teacher and haven't read this book, it's good to know  to add some intrigue about this, as it is very subtle).<br />One of the most  wonderful aspects about this book is that it makes us so very thankful for  the world we have, with all its imperfections. A perfectly safe world is  not so appealing afterall! It's certainly not without a very dark, secret  underbelly. What is &quot;Releasing?&quot; A discovery more shocking than  no colour! And this plot thread I won't give away!<br />A good &quot;while  reading&quot; technique is to make a Venn diagram to compare &quot;The  Future Community&quot; to &quot;Our Community&quot;, noting the  similarities and differences. It makes a good, thoughtful focuser for the  students.<br />The ambiguous ending, I've found, leaves kids quite  dissatisfied. Many of them feel cheated. Personally, I think this is  wonderful, for it may be their first novel to not have all the loose ends  neatly tied. Lowry leaves room for their own interpretation. What I like to  do is not read the final chapter until after the kids have written their  own endings. This way they can better deal with the amibiguity at the end,  because they've thought it through to their own satisfaction already.  <br />I'd highly recommend this book if you love good, thought-provoking  literature. Lowry shows true genius, and stimulates very high-level  thinking.
0446310786|5.0|I read this about 20 years ago for the 1st time and liked it. Recently I  read it and thought it was great. I try to read a classic every 5 books or  so. The lives of Scout and Jem are very well put. The trial of Tom  Robinson(a travesty) and the antics of Dill add to it. Atticus is also a  strong character. But the ever elusive Boo Radley steals the show as much  of this great book will show. If you haven't read it in 20 plus years give  it a try.
0380778556|5.0|Daphne du Maurier's brilliantly conceived, masterfully written book Rebecca, is an unforgettable masterpiece of love and suspense.  This book cleverly incoporates love, betrayal, passion, suspense and thrill. Rebecca  is one of the most enjoyable and thrilling books that I have  ever read.  With a magnificant storyline, and wonderfull executed characters, this book  is hard to put down.  This is by far the best book that du Maurier has ever  written.
0449002632|4.0|The epic historical novel is back! It is not without cause that Rutherfurd has been described as the British Mitchener, and this novel, London, is of the same great tradition.<br />At several hundred pages long this book is, if  nothing else, simply great value for money! However, it's length should not  in any way make this novel daunting. It's epic scope, charting the history  and growth of one of the world's great cities, could hardly have been  written in 220 pages! Rutherfurd has cut his mammoth novel into very  manageable and logical chunks by chapter, and this aids digestion  considerably.<br />As a graduate student of history I appreciated Rutherfurd's  immense research and attention to detail. Reading this book made me feel as  if the writing of it must have been the easiest part -- the research  involved must have been enormous.<br />Cleverly written, London's history is  chronicled via various families and their intersecting stories. The family  trees and timeline at the beginning of the book are invaluable! This  enables the reader to identify with the changing of the characters that  take place as time advances.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and heartily  recommend it to any lover of good quality historical fiction.
B00004TLMC|1.0|With all the publicity this film received it was a must see for me, but wait a minute, what is this my simple taste just can not see the grandeur.  This is not a case of misunderstanding on my part (man, women, birth, life,  death, infinity) but rather bordom with the intellectual complacency for  anything bizaar.  The nudity...come on now anyone who has made it through  puberty should be over the giggly &quot;Oh look they are is naked&quot; by  now.  This is nether art nor good taste, but it is what they (the film  industry)tell us we want.  The movie as a whole has to much of everything  that says &quot;you need to be really intellectual to understand  it&quot;...my feeling is the movie is naked...and this director and those  who bought it could not see.  Try Dr.Strangelove which is strange, and the  characters are strange, but the issues (like the film) are black and white.
B00004TL21|5.0|This album rocks.It even Has Manyard James Keenan from Perfect circle and Tool on one track. Chino's vocals set the mood for the wave of guitar sound. Buy this album you will not be let down.It is a down to earth hard  rock album.
B00004TL21|4.0|Not as hard as the first two but I still love it.  The songs seem to have a little more work put into them than the standard play and record and after you listen to the album a couple of times you will appreciate it and  want to crank it up.
B000002TWN|5.0|D' is one of the 90's best artists.  And Brown Sugar is probably one of the most controversial and greatest debut albums ever.  It's a mixture of jazz, gospel, funk, soul, and r&amp;b.  Some of the best songs on the album are &quot;Higher&quot;, &quot;Me and Dreamin' Eyes of Mine&quot;, and  &quot;When We Get By&quot;.  And if you like this you will love Voodoo.
0385334176|4.0|Deadeye Dick is the kind of thing that your average person might write after a prolonged lack of sleep when the 'giddies' sets in.  It doesn't entirely make sense, and some of the themes are a little wacky, but it is  still very entertaining and fun to read.  Vonnegut manages to use plenty of  his traditionally biting humor throughout the book and deals with neutron  bombs, eccentric artists, criminal coverups, and life after Ohio is  obliterated.  I am already biased because I am a big fan of Vonnegut's  style of writing, but I found the book to be consistently interesting and  can't wait to get another of his books
B00000F3TS|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, then you have no idea what you're missing. I must have seen the Goonies about a hundred times since I was a kid. It remains the best and most entertaining film I've ever seen. Chunk, and Mouth, and Data are some of my favorite characters in film. YOU HAVE TO BUY  THIS MOVIE...!
B00004TL21|5.0|One of the most anticipated rock albums of the apst few years has finally arrived. After the fantastic 'Around The Fur' album, it seemed that the all mighty Deftones had reached their peak...they could not have been more wrong. From this album, you can clearly see that the band have not only  just developed musically, they piss all over Korn and Limp Bizkit, who have  stayed on the same 'sell loads of records' formula for too long, and  Deftones have easily overtaken them. The best track on this album is the  fantastic 'Passenger' which features the vocals of Tool/Perfect Circle's  Maynard James Keenan. This album is incredible, it really does have to be  lsitened too to understand how brillinat it is, it's...Oh, just go and  buy it!
B000000OE7|5.0|Although this album is quite noticably diferent from most other Queen albums (only perhaps baring Innuendo), it is still not to be missed. It's quite a piece of work, and is by far one of the most emotional albums the  group ever released. &quot;Mother Love,&quot; &quot;Heaven For  Everyone&quot; and &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; are without a doubt tied for  my  three favorite songs on this album. &quot;Mother Love&quot; moves me to  tears every time, especially  the line 'I long for peace before I die...'  &quot;Heaven For Everyone&quot; is a glimpse of a world where everyone has  someone to comfort them in times of hardship. &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; is  a moving song that so perfectly reflects Freddie's place on this earth that  it's frightening, even after he has been removed from it leaving a gaping  hole, never to be filled. The song &quot;Born to Love You&quot; breaks the  stride of the album a bit, but it is merely a falter that is quickly  regained. Besides, Queen albums have always been a mix of styles. All in  all, this is a wonderful sendoff for a wonderful man.
0783226063|2.0|Well I was hoping for the whole movie.  The director's cut of this movie.  Which was excellent.  But of course the studio sells the cheap version of the movie.  I wish these studios would give the consumer what they want.  I  want all those scenes that you deemed to delete, which then makes people  ask well why did he do that?  I all these studios realize their stupid  mistakes and put out some better dvd's with more features.  Like a  director's cut, or deleted scenes, behind the scenes.  In my opinion don't  buy this movie wait and hope it comes out in the director's cut.
0385493800|4.0|John Grisham books are the Denny's restaurants of the literary world...you always know what you are going to get! That's not necessarily a bad thing though. I enjoyed the quick, no brainer read that The Testament provided.  (It was almost as easy as watching television). It's a good, sturdy read to  pass the time between more strenous selections.
0140067477|4.0|This book is a little treasure. It takes the beloved story of Winnie the Pooh and explains the complexities of Toaism. It's not trite or juvenile however.  It's quite simple to read and will leave you feeling like you  learned something that you want to share.
B000000WCA|3.0|The Spice Girls are great, and even though they're not &quot;in&quot; anymore, (::disgusted snort::) their music started a music evoltuion. Sure, the vocals aren't the best, and lyrics are slighty trite - but really, you  can't tell me whenever Wannabe came on the radio you didn't start singing  along! :) This is best karaoke album (even beats Spiceworld) on the face of  the planet - made by five heartfelt girls who really loved music and the  notion of girl power. So it's old. So it's corny. It's kinda good, too.
0679805273|5.0|I recently gave this book to a friend as a graduation present and it was just as topical as when you read it to a child. Seriously, this book sparks the imagination and captures the feeling of invincability that children  have.  Dr. Seuss is great anytime but this book is particularly wonderful  because it gives children a chance to dream about themselves and their  lives.
0671027344|5.0|&quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; was the best book I have ever read in my fourteen years. Horrifyingly real but entertaining at the same time - it's a surprise that this Stephen Chbosky's *first* novel. It's  beautifully written, insightful; just brilliant.
B00004TL21|4.0|Deftones are one of  the most original bands ever and have always remained true and have never sold out as some other bands have in the past. If you liked the last two cds you should probably add this one to your collection.  Although some songs are more mello they still rock and there are still  songs that are heavy rap core like Korea. I have benn a devoted fan for  some time i just saw them at ozzfest last year which was a crazy show. if  you are a true fan i recomend you buy this one.
B00001NFCY|5.0|One of my very first CDs, Creed's &quot;Human Clay&quot; remains a favorite. The opening &quot;Are You Ready&quot; is a footstomping anthem. &quot;What If&quot; holds the best guitar riffs. Beautiful is just what  it's titled. Higher is one of the BEST songs on the planet - just catchy  enough to hold more respect than BSB, and with positively remarkable  lyrics. Ending the record is &quot;Inside Us All&quot; which is slightly  corny, but how can you ever diss Creed? Get the album, you won't be sorry.  :)
B00000K31Q|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!   GREAT!
6305428220|1.0|This is one of the most hilarious pseudo horror flicks I have ever seen in my life. A drug dealing teen is the hero of the whole ordeal.(Dumb Idea! ) A cocaine like drug becomes a test for people infected by alien  organisms.(Dumb Idea! ) The clincher for me is the sweet blonde haired  girl from Atlanta, Georgia who starts out as just your average new girl in  town. In the end she gets naked(Great idea! ) and then gets ugly(turns  into hideous, menacing alien creature.(Scary!  No! ) This movie certainly  has some &quot;original&quot; ideas and definitely gives viewers a whole  new outlook of southern women(just kidding) and it is an incredibly wierd  sci-fi horror flick but its originality is not for the better. I find the  attempts at scaring the bejesus out of its audience in a high school  atmosphere to just be different and sometimes(and in this case) being  original is just being different(not better). The only redeeming quality  for this flick would be to watch this movie for its comedic value.  &quot;The Faculty&quot; is almost classic in the so bad that it's good  genre. It has &quot;Your not going to believe this one&quot; stamped all  over it. &quot;The Faculty&quot; is so bad that it is worth a look if maybe  only to see the blonde to behemoth transformation scene.
B00004TL21|3.0|This album is so different than their first two its hard to even compare them.  Don't expect ripping tunes like Engine #9.  I don't think this effort is all that good, but it really isn't my style.
B00004T1YD|5.0|For those of you who have never heard any cuts from the live video &quot;No Bull&quot; by AC/DC, this is the single for you! It really showcases just how great AC/DC is live. Featuring two of the best songs off  of &quot;Ballbreaker,&quot; both the title track and &quot;Hard As a  Rock&quot; performed live off of &quot;No Bull&quot;, plus one of AC/DC's  newest and best songs &quot;Stiff Upper Lip,&quot; this import single is  definitely worth the price for any AC/DC fan.  A must have, as it's  virtually impossible to find any CD-quality tracks from &quot;No  Bull.&quot; Go for it!
0553260111|4.0|Robert Ludlum tended to drag this book out a little much. It was still readable though. This man has no idea who he is. He finally starts piecing the puzzle together. He kidnaps a woman who winds up being his future wife  and proves to be invaluable in his quest for his identity. His most  shocking discovery comes when he discovers that he is wanted dead or alive  by international killer &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot;. After several near  assasinations the book ends leaving room for a sequel. Buy this book but  pay attention or you will get lost.
B00004TL21|5.0|i have been a fan of the deftones since 95 and each album gets better and better. yeah this album isn't as heavy as the last 2 but who cares the music is awesome. any band can play loud and scream, but it takes true  talent to make a good song and the deftones made 11 on this album. they  still have their heavy songs, but they wrote more well rounded songs on  this album. definetly go buy this album cuz the deftones are gonna explode
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Apple's sophomore album is done much better than her freshman one, Tital. Apple uses many various beats to find a good medium. It's just too bad that the album is only 10 songs long and about 45 minutes in length. Fiona  rocks!  She was amazing in concert! I saw her twice and she rocked the  house!

6304342160|3.0|I saw this late one night on TV and thought it wasn't too bad. I loved Jennifer Tilly in 'Bride of Chucky' as well. This film is a sexy crime thriller with a lesbian atmospheare to it. (Which is different) there are  also violent moments too. You can tell by the direction of 'Bound' that it  is by the Wachowski bros, with its stylish look upon it. As crime thrillers  go, this one ain't too bad.
6305903182|4.0|...or at least almost as terrifying as the first.  A lot of people have  said they didn't enjoy this final Scream, but I for one found it to be as  enjoyable as the second (which I found to be as enjoyable as the first).   Of course, Scream 1 gets major points for being revolutionary, which is  always tough to follow, but the third installment does it quite well.  Its  hall of mirrors plot (is it a movie or is it real life?) keeps you guessing  until the end when it finally topples over with ridiculousness.  However,  when the credits roll, hopefully you'll forget about the holes you found as  the conclusion was unraveling and remember the thrilling ride you just  experienced.  Neve Campbell is at the top of her game here with an  expressive and deeply affecting performance.  The rest of the cast are also  competent players, with Parker Posey being the hilarious standout.  She's  worth the movie itself.  All in all, I wish I could have been more  satisfied with the final chapter since the previous two installments were  so excellent, but I was still very satisfied.  Scream 3 is definitely worth  a buy.
B00000K3UR|5.0|I was hestitant watching this movie, but i sat myself down and I watched it. It was funny, moving, and i have a whole new respect for Adam Sandler. I like it when comedians show a little drama. It shows they can act (ex.  Jim Carrey). Adam Sandler just got a new fan!  I highly recommend it!
B00004TL21|4.0|I can't say enough how amazing of a band the Deftones really are..I've been a huge fan ever since Adrenaline and couldn't wait for the new cd to come out. Needless to say I was not disappointed. The Deftones have been  threatening for quite sometime to &quot;soften&quot; their sound and The  White Pony is evidence of their evolving musical tastes. But this is no way  to say it is a step down in quality, because believe me it isn't! The songs  are more textured, the lyrics more personal and insightful. This cd takes  you inside and doesn't let you go..The first single &quot;Change&quot; is a  perfect example..The almost haunting guitars and Chino's signature voice  shine on this track and throughout. Although their third release is a lot  different (true deftones fans will understand this!), the guys don't forget  what made them the band they are today- and songs such as &quot;Elite&quot;  and&quot; &quot;Korea&quot; are evidence of this. &quot;Elite&quot; is the  hardest track on the record by far. Maybe a bit repitious, but still  cool..My favorite tracks on the cd (in no particular order): &quot;Digital  Bath&quot;- an amazing song, maybe the best on the cd, &quot;Knife  Party&quot;, &quot;Change&quot; (in the house of flies),  &quot;Passenger&quot;- an amazing collaboration with Maynard from Tool- he  makes this song what it is, and &quot;Korea&quot;-many people know this  song from Ozzfest last year and its one of the heavier songs on the record.  The only reason I gave the cd 4 stars intstead of 5 is because I would have  liked to see a few harder songs, maybe in places of more experimental songs  like &quot;Teenager&quot;. But hey thats me..All I can say is buy this cd,  put it in, and let the Deftones take you into their world. You'll be glad  you did..
0679746048|5.0|I loved &quot;Girl Interrupted.&quot;  I think the characterization of everything and everyone was very accurate.  The way things were in institutions in the 1960's isn't much different from today.  And I know  firsthand.   If anyone ever dared to wonder about life in the  &quot;parallel universe,&quot; then I strongly suggest reading this book  with an open mind and an open heart.

B00004SCX6|2.0|I give Britney 2 stars for a slight improvement over her 1st album, but this CD is overall not very good. Britney has no real vocal talent and sings meaningless bubblegum-pop. All I can say is that she has great  managers because, considering her complete lack of talent, her CDs are not  as bad as some. My least favorite songs on here are &quot;Oops...&quot; and  &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. The best tracks are &quot;Stronger&quot; and  &quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know&quot;- she almost sounds as if she  can sing on these two.
B000002IZ4|3.0|Much, much better than their debut. In &quot;purple&quot; they develop their own style, and shed the copycat label given to them by so many critics. The songs themselves are some of the best that they have written.  &quot;Vasoline&quot;, &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot;, and &quot;Big  Empty&quot; are incredible. However, the harder songs fail to impress much.  They're ok, not bad, but not very good either. &quot;Meat Plow&quot;,  &quot;Lounge Fly&quot;, and &quot;silvergun superman&quot; have very little  to offer. They don't have great riffs, good solos, or energy. Now, this is  a good album, and I don't want to scare you away. It's definitely worth the  money, and you get quite a few lovely tunes. However, &quot;Tiny  Music&quot; and &quot;No.4&quot; are much better, despite their lack of  radio friendly singles.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is a must-have album. I bought this album for one song, and that song is &quot;Natural Blues&quot;. I never really paid attention to the other tracks until I listened to it in a CD player that can't fast-forward  through tracks, and let me tell you, this is AWESOME. I ended up liking  most of the tracks. I'm a fan of R&amp;B, Pop, and Rock, and this album has  all of those, not to include some of the sweet sounds of ambient music  (that i've just discovered with this album). Stand-out tracks: Find My  Baby, Porcelain, Southside, Bodyrock, Natural Blues, Outside, and My  Weakness.
B00004TL21|4.0|Once again the Deftones have done a wonderful job of recreating the magic of Around the Fur, and Deftones.  The beats do not dissappoint, and the vocals are just short of greatness.  Suported by thumping drum lines and  bass riffs that can't go unnoticed, they have out done themselves this  time!   I give it a thumbs up!
0553280325|5.0|Okay, sorry for the pun, but it's true. Hear we have probably one of the most effecting horror novels ever written. What makes Bradbury so powerful a writer. It's not just the simple, yet lyrical, prose, but how every word  seems to pulse with the theme of his stories. Bradbury is a master  fanticist, who, like Gene Wolfe or Harlan Ellison, has written an large  amount of stories in various genres (SF, Horror, even mainstream) yet alway  maintaining the same style and texture. Any one who loves good writting  should at least read this, The Martian Chronicles, and Fahrenheit 451.
B00004TL21|2.0|The first 2 cd's kicked ass! Looks like the deftones have slipped into KoRn's sell out category.  Will the deftones be on puma commercials next? They are playing family values 2000, all the sell outs do.
B000002UAR|5.0|I know many people claim Sgt. Pepper is/was the best Beatles album; and who can doubt the influence it had on countless artists and fans.  However, for me, from the first song to the last this is a stronger effort.  The  influence this album also had on the San Francisco music scene (to follow  the next year) was huge.  I have heard and seen countless interviews of  members of the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane (etc.) talk about the  first time they heard this album and, in particular, the song Tomorrow  Never Knows.  <br />The opening track by George Harrison was an obvious  influence on Punk and new wave; particularly the Jam (listen to the song  Start and Pretty Green.)  Eleanor Rigby's use of string instruments  deserves an obvious nod to their producer George Martin.  John Lennon's  introspective I'm Only Sleeping is excellent.  George Harrison introduces  the sitar in Love You To.  Paul McCartney's obvious ode to Linda Eastman on  Here, There and Everywhere.  Ringo sings on Yellow Submarine.  John Lennon  writes about the difficulties of his first marriage in She Said She Said.   McCartney's classic pop number Good Day Sunshine follows (also influenced  by his relationship with Linda).  John Lennon takes a stab at their Guru in  India with And Your Bird Can Sing.  Paul McCartney writes about the breakup  of a marriage in For No One.  John Lennon wrote about drug use in Doctor  Robert.  George Harrison again contributes a strong number in I Want To  Tell You.  Paul McCartney (clearly head over heals in love with Linda)  writes another one for Linda in Got To Get You Into My Life.  Finally, the  song that was the springboard for Sgt. Pepper, Tomorrow Never Knows.<br />In  many respects, this album marks the transition from John Lennon as the  primary hit song writer of the Beatles to Paul McCartney.  After this  album, John's song writing was never quite as strong as Paul in terms of  having the potential for 'A' side material.  Much of this might be to thebreakup of John's first marriage and the beginning of his heroin addiction.   Nevertheless, this album finds both John and Paul at their peak with  exceptional contributions from George Harrison as well.  In addition,  Paul's tendency to write overtly schmaltzy pop material on later Beatles  albums was kept to a minimum here on Revolver.  <br />I only rate 2 Beatles  albums as five stars.  I think too often, people rate albums five stars  when they clearly have more than one weak song on the record.  I also  recommend this CD to start and then follow this one up with A Hard Days  Night.  Then you follow with Sgt. Pepper (4.5 stars, Rubber Soul (4.5  stars), Abbey Road(4.5 stars), Let It Be (4 stars), Past Masters Vol 1  &amp; 2 (4 stars), the White Album (4 stars) and Magical Mystery Tour (4  stars).   The remainder you can decide for yourself if or how you want to  buy them.  I have them all as they are all worth having if you are a  Beatles fan.
B00004TL21|2.0|The Deftones are one of those bands that I can respect for writing their own stuff and not worrying about popularity. Unfortunately, I cannot appreciate their music. All of their songs sound just about the same, and  none of the musicians in the band are particularly talented. The lifeless,  effects-heavy vocals are probably the worst part of the album: Chino seems  to do little more than whisper in a very annoying tone or deliver a  tiresome, emotionless scream that serves no purpose. This being said, the  Deftones have managed to put out another generic sounding, bland metal  album that is listenable, but by no means &quot;essential&quot; nor even  all that interesting.
B000002UAF|5.0|If you have read my revolver review, you now know that I recommend this CD as your second Beatles purchase.   This was their third LP released (in the UK) and they really must have been inspired from their previous year of  touring.  They also had the ability to finally pen all of the songs.  From  the opening chord to A Hard Days Night the playing is crisp, sharp and  inspired.  <br />After you have purchased this, your next purchase should be  Sgt. Pepper.
B00004TL21|5.0|I've been waiting for a long time for this cd to be released. it is a great cd, my second favorite of the year, it has great rock tracks.  a must have for a true rock fan
B00004TL21|4.0|For those of you not acquainted with the Deftones, their previous two albums (Adrenaline and Around the Fur) were records filled with crunching riffs and melodic rhymes.  Very much the sound of the &quot;new&quot;  hardcore rap-metal scene (with more emphasis on metal). &quot;White  Pony&quot; however is VERY different.  Same dissonance, some nice riffs,  but overall, almost like a concept-type Floyd album.  The album is a lot  less strenuous on the eardrums, but at the same time, the Deftones have  created a very original type of music (very hard to label).  By  incorporating a DJ (and this being their 3rd album), the tracks sound very  polished and very clean.  More emphasis has been placed on melody, rhythm  and lyrics, and less on providing ear-shattering fast-paced, driving music.   Chino's voice in most songs is almost whispering to you.  In fact, there  is only one pure metal song on the album (Elite) complete with Chino's  trademark screams and Deftones' crushing guitar riffs.   In my honest  opinion, I think this will be the Deftones' album which will go mainstream  (with MTV videos, etc.) and allow more fans to hear these underrated  musicians.  (Hopefully, the song with Tool frontman, Maynard will get some  airplay, as it is the best song on the album... track 9). I liked the  different, artsy approach the band took with this album, although some  die-hard Deftones fans might not like it.  They've gone soft, maybe.  And  for that, I dock one star...
B000002N2Z|5.0|Adrenaline #1 is much better than Around the Fur. Every song on this title is great, especially Minus Blindfold, 7 Words, Bored, and Engine No. 9. This album brings out true talent.
0767903854|5.0|Finally there is a factual and entertaining book about Australia.  Having lived in Australia for several years, I can attest to the veracity of the author's research and conclusions.  I loved Bryson's droll and  conversational style of writing.  Moreover, he reveals all the  idiosyncracies and facts that Americans should know before venturing Down  Under. Thankfully, he mentions all the unimagined vastness and deadly  creatures found everywhere. My only disappointment was that he did not  visit Tasmania, which I and many others regard as the most beautiful state  in Australia.  But, hey, he couldn't see everything - that would take  months.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone interested in this  unique continent and the incomparable and wonderful Aussies.
6304578482|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. Mira and Jeanine are at their sexiest. Lisa's acting was also great. Good job
B00003W8NM|4.0|I liked everything this film was TRYING to say. I hold Ed Norton as one of the finer actors of his generation.  Fincher is an able director. Brad Pitt can make sparks fly in the right hands. The production design is without  fault.  Unfortunately, the structure and the payoff don't quite meld into a  satisfying experience.  By the final third, one is left with &quot;is that  IT?&quot; as the riddle of conflict is unveiled.  Still, FIGHT CLUB remains  a rarity: a thinking person's film.  It has anger and pizzazz, but suffers  some confusion with its oddball dance with homerotica that more or less  winds up as curious windowdressing, and not much else, considering the  film's pretentions to being deep.  It is great to hear one cry against our  numbing consumerism, and that I champion.  I just wish the film had been a  smashing success instead of a beautiful but amputated statue.
B000002UJQ|5.0|&quot;OK Computer&quot; is a manifesto whose lyrics - accented by a progressive and at times dreamy sound - bring pause for re-evaluating priorities.  Priorities which, as the overall mode of the album suggests,  get lost in the shuffle in the hi-tech, seemingly materialistic world of  today. Walk into any &quot;mega&quot; variety store and with &quot;fitter  happier&quot; in mind see that Radiohead wasn't pulling  punches with this  concept album.
B00004STPT|3.0|It was definitely smart of Hans to enlist Lisa Gerard, whose work on THE INSIDER made for one of last year's better scores (and some great Dead Can Dance albums).  Admittedly, I am not a huge Zimmer fan, although I felt he  held promise in his early days before he &quot;went Hollywood&quot; and set  up shop in Tinseltown.  His earlier scores for such small films as  &quot;Wonderland&quot; promised things yet delivered, and most of his  recent output -while pleasing to the studio executives - sounds hollow,  corporate and &quot;farmed-out&quot; to his stable of composers to my ears.   No one doubts the man has talent, it's just that he gets mired in the  technical, which speaks for our age.  GLADIATOR works well on most cues -  those featuring Gerard being the best. Like other recent Zimmer scores,  it's a grab-bag of styles and influences, but coheres better on this disc  than usual.
B00004SVID|5.0|4 and a half star average?  Whats up with that?  This is the single greatest live album ever.  Im not a fan of live albums but there is no way this one should be less than 5.  The energy put forth by the artists is  astounding. With great guitar parts, along with excelent lyrics and vocals,  this CD is a must for any Classic Rock/Hard Rock, and any other kind of  rock fan.
B00003CX6P|5.0|Riffing as it does on the Cain and Abel story from the Bible, RIPLEY is a lyrical and melancholic study of a gifted lower-class boy (Damon)who trades own soul for that of a spoiled, narcissistic playboy (Law) in the course of  his coveting the sybaritic lifestyle enjoyed by the narcissist and his  vapid girlfriend (Paltrow).  The homosexual underpinnings are essentially  inconsequential, although they add some spice to the proceedings.  The true  pyschological study here is a focus on how covetousness leads to greed and  greed flips one so easily into the realm of sociopathy (one could venture  to say it's an astute comment on today's &quot;gimme everything&quot;  America).  Jude Law's Dickie is a classic sociopath - charming, charismatic  - bouncing from one bright bauble to another, and sucking the blood out of  anyone on his way without remorse or consciousness. In the hands of Law, he  is fascinating, sexy, and despicable, and we root for his death at one  point when he tosses away Ripley's naive love like yesterday's tee shirt.   Damon deserved better reviews that he received: his Ripley is an opaque  being who is gradually formed as he masters more and more conflict in the  course of the film, and by the time he has found himself saddled with the  murderous soul of the man he loved, he's twice as fascinating as when the  film began.  Not an easy part to play as reconceived from Highsmith's novel  by director Minghella.  Seymour Hoffman's turn as a bully, Cate Blanchett's  utterly stellar presence as a devil-may-care socialite, Gabriel Yared's  heartbreaking score, and Minghella's swan song to the 'La Dolce Vita' years  all add up to a mesmerizing experience.  It's the kind of thriller Brian de  Palma wishes he could have summoned the talent to make, but never did.   Impregnated with many stunning visual motifs (statues, ominous neckties,  vulnerable necks), and drenched in Italian ambience, RIPLEY is the treat of  1999.  One wonders how it ever escaped the studios as intact as it did.  As  the final song over the end credits says, &quot;you don't  know what love  is, until you you know the meaning of the blues.&quot;  Poor Ripley has the  most serious case of the blues anyone suffered by the time this film ends.   This DVD version is pristine.
006097625X|5.0|I simply loved every moment reading this one. I had read the Eisner book on comics, which is a must read and an excellent source for information for sure, but I really liked this one better. The book simply takes you into  the world of comics in one big swoop and won't let you go until the last  page. All I can complain is the huge craving for more. I was on the verge  of leaving the book out when making an order as I was able to borrow it but  finally made the call to get one of my very own. The book doesn't just  cover comics in technique but gives the reader a general insight on how  comics are placed in the field of arts among other arts. It also gives a  great view on how the first timer enthusiast becomes one of the pros.  Whether you desire to make comics or not you should take a look at this  one; it's worth every cent. I can't wait to read it again.
B00004LN16|4.0|Overall, a great CD, although two songs...&quot;Safe in NYC&quot; and &quot;House of Jazz&quot; are not that great.  Back in Black and Highway are their top 2, this one is definitely #3.  A good buy.
0375501851|5.0|In the last thirty-five years, I can remember &quot;outright and prolonged laughter&quot; while reading three novels:  K. Amis's &quot;Lucky Jim,&quot; P. Roth's &quot;Portnoy's Complaint,&quot; and D. Lodge's  &quot;The British Museum is Falling Down.&quot;  It has been a long time  but, finally, here is one more to add to the list.  In some ways, what Ms  Smith has done is even more impressive when one realizes that her humor is  spread among a very wide cast of characters, all of whom we come to know  very well, and a variety of times and situations.  The narrative has a real  drive to it and this, too, intensifies both the humor and the pathos of the  characters.  It is not as if these characters are particularly novel:  the  reader will probably feel that he or she knows them or their type.  But  what Ms. Smith does is to take the familiar and give it a twist or a shove  into some unexpected territory.  This ability as well as the broad cultural  [popular as well as the more traditional and literary] foundation from  which the author works make it all the more remarkable that this novel was  written when she was only twenty-one.  I suppose this is to her credit as  well as to the credit of the British educational system.  One thing is  certain:  This is one writer who seems to be able to see more facets of the  ethnic and cultural melange than just about anyone else. It may be a  cliche, but while I couldn't stop reading, I certainly did not want the  book to end.  And I await Ms. Smith's second novel with great anticipation.
6305169187|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that my fellow readers is absolutely NO joke. The special F/X are brilliant,but that's the movie's only saving grace.Everything else you can throw in the trash.Despite a superb cast of actors,the acting was very oddly sub-par.These are some of the best actors in movie history and they deliver acting that fails to impress.The characters have practically no depth and are simply nothing more than cardboard.The movie is about 3 hours long so technically,I wasted three hours I'll never get back.The script is pretty bad. The events are practically predictable and the movie is just plain boring from beginning to middle to end.The characters are SO annoying that I was actually hoping they'd all get destroyed by the asteroid.Each and every single one of 'em.D-grade acting,a horrendous script, sub-par direction and a terrible ending made this a VERY unpleasent experience.It DOES deserve the one star that I'm giving it,though,cuz the F/X are unbelieveable,but everything else makes this one of the worst movies ever.Avoid it at all costs.Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi violence, unexpected high profanity and pretty strong sex material.
B000001GPX|5.0|I can not exactly describe what I felt when I first listened to this no.5. It's a shock and I found myself trembling. Very, very few performaces can catch the nuanced tempo hide in music so well, so correct, so moving. (Even  a same conductor with a same orchestra can falls into routine. I doubt if  Kleiber and VPO do the second time they will surpass this version). As this  disc showes , such an almost perfect perfomance is indeed very, very rare.  An exciting air encircles the whole 2 symphonies from the very beginning,  the conductor and the orchestra breath together, then become one in  Beethovan. This Cd is DOOMED to be immortal. After 100 years we will still  deeply moved. Highly Recommended.
0375703764|4.0|I used to be scared of the dark, till maybe I was six. I mean scared. I wouldn't go upstairs without someone else; if my sister tried to sneak up without me, I'd run after her. Well. Twelve years later, I find myself  running past the dark rooms in my House and keeping the light on till I can  fall asleep.<BR> This book will turn your pages. Some people argue that  there's meaningless footnotes and praise for this book derives from the  format of the text -- well, if you're only looking at the surface, you  won't enjoy it -- be shaken by it? -- as fully as you should.<BR> Sure, I  rushed through all that blab on old man Z and even Johnny Truant for the  House. What makes this book so horrific, including the formatting and  nonsentical footnotes, is the House. What makes it so fearsome is the fact  that this isn't about some monster running after you -- the House itself is  the thing to fear. Unhuman, emotionless, yet utterly beastial.<BR> Creature  darkness, indeed. Although it might take some patience (this from an  impatient person), the book is well worth the read if you ignore just the  surface of it; like a well, there's a lot more depth below your reflected  face.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie is a very good movie and had a lot of heart felt moments.  The  plot was good and the special effects were good also.  It was adventerous  and entertaining.  I liked it cause it was a family orientated movie and  you could watch it with the family with out being embaraced. I recommend  this one.  If you like, spoofs from the trekky era, then this is the one to  see. &quot;With the Kids&quot;.
B00000JCOV|5.0|The first time i listened to this cd i was just blown away by the guitars and vocals of this band.They are very promising for this being their debut album.My favorite songs are surfacing andsic because they rock and they  blow you away.BUY THIS CD
B00004THAY|2.0|58 rhapsodizing reviews...<br />What I can I say--both of these guys have better albums individually, and other than their status, this is far from the most *interesting* blues music being put out today.  Look at the  covershot, everything about the packaging...slick car, slick suits, the  most expensive guitars available.  These guys started in the blues, but  their music has transcended to something else.<br />No hard feelings, but I  don't think it's that great, either.  Give me a new Fat Possum release over  this , anyday.  I want raw, and I want emotion.  BB's voice indeed still  carries that, but the playing is so uptown, and Clapton is NOT in blues  mode, he's still stuck in Babyface/cross-over crooning.<br />Buy a poster if  you can get one; this disc will be forgettable as soon as all the cloying  fawning has passed.
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones come out with one of the most hyped up albums of the summer and they sure did not disappoint. Deftones come out with great melodies and rock music to ensure your money worth. Get this album all the songs are  great!
B00004T8RK|4.0|I have not really heard this album..just a couple of tracks but i can tell its a good cd...much better than Yield. Many people have said to me that Nothing as it seems is such a slow, boring, coma-inducing song but i  disagree. You have to listen to it a few times to appreciate its  magnificence. Its a good follow up to Last Kiss which is a classic.  Vedder's voice always spellbounds me and i am taken to the very core of the  lyrics....you FEEL them. Pearl Jam can be content with this one.
0671042858|4.0|I didn't expect much from this book, but as the mother of a nine-year-old girl I found it especially compelling.  I started reading it the day I brought it home and ended up neglecting all my usual weekend stuff because  I couldn't put it down.  Some of Trish's actions and language didn't ring  true for a kid that age, but what the heck.  This story of being lost in  the woods and chased by a monster was scary, satisfying, and just plain  fun.
B000002HHB|5.0|This disc has so many facets:<br />Sparse and painful ballads:  Beloved Wife, Seven Years, and River<br />Pop songs with serious topics:  Wonder and San Andreas Fault<br />And songs that just plain tell stories while sounding so  good:  Carnival, Jealousy, Cowboy Romance, and Where I Go.<br />The songs  highlight the richness of her voice and are mixed with understated music  from the band.
B00004TL21|5.0|the deftones are the most awesome band out there with their head banging, ass kicking music, the have started their own genre. whoever says that the deftones copy koRn don't know what they r saying. Don't get me wrong, koRn  is f**king awesome but Deftones are deffinately on the same level as koRn.  i am actuallu seeing them in 3 days at 92.3 K Rocks Dysfunctional Family  Picnic. I haven't gotten this cd yet, however i have their past two cds and  they r amazing.White Pony,is supposedly going to out do all of their past  cds. And any cd that can out do any deftone cd must  be awesome. Already  some of their songs are hits on some of my local radio stations. Deffinatly  get this cd. If not- you will miss some awesome heavy metal that you will  keep in your cd collection for life. Peace. DEFTONES KICK ASS
B00004TL21|4.0|This cd was pretty good it is not as heavy as there other cds but it is still listenable.  The best song is passenger because chino sings with maynard from tool.  The robot is really rusty i need to put oil on him so he can move.  two ninjas jump on my roof hey get down from there ninjas i  dont want u on my roof

B00000IAU3|5.0|Well, I do not have much to add to some of the positive comments.  I was getting my hair done and heard the entire album and had to ask who it was.  Since one week ago after I bought this album, I have listened to it over  and over - that is how good it is.  It really gets better each listening.   She has a wonderful voice, the lyrics are quite simple but effective, and  the melodies and musical riffs are amazing and almost every song has a  great chorus with good punch, but yet filled with so much emotion. If you  like the mellow sounds of Cowboy Junkies or even Enya, you will simply love  this band. Bravo for Dido! I cannot wait for another record.
156895963X|4.0|A lot of people have reviewed this book on shere impulse, stating clearly this is &quot;the best book I have ever read&quot;. This opinion is, however, not shared by me.<br />Don't get me wrong, the right of passage story  of Frank McCourt is definetely uplifting, but is it for this reason a  masterpiece? It is a terrific read for all readers, but the actual  storyline is not so significant or impressive that one must be dumbfounded  by it! Emotional literature does not mean masterpiece, however it is a  great read!
B000002IOW|5.0|This is one of my favorites. The heavy guitar and drumming blows even my high powered sterio away! I know at this age I should like the Backstreet Boys or N'sync, but Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart could blow them  out of the water! The songs are a little to slow for my liking, and there  really wasn't a lot of Lifeson's signuture guitar playing, but this cd  still rocks. <br />Theres even a really really good picture of Alex Lifeson  and the gang in it too. <br />This is the way music should be. Take N'sync for  example. All they do is sing. But how could there be a music group with out  the music?  You never see the people who make any of the music in these new  bands. (Thank goodness for Kid Rock.)<br />Beleave me, get this CD, it'll blow  you away! Go Alex Lifeson!
B00004TL21|4.0|on retrouve bien ds ce CD les samples de deftones et surtout cette magnifique voix qui m'a fait aime deftones.certes il n'egalera pas leur dernier album mais tendra a lui faire de l'ombre!
0688014291|3.0|Despite the wonderful accomplishments of Drs. Blanchard and Johnson, this book was very dissappointing.  <br />I think of it as typical consultants' babble because you will get wrapped up in intellectual theories and  appraoches to the art of management, but after you put the book down you'll  realize you've got nothing tangible and practical to use in your everyday  life.  As a management consultant once explained to me about his field,  many consultants are good &quot;Beanbag Punchers&quot;.  They make an  amazing change where they strike the bag, but on the opposite side nothing  has really changed.  I was disappointed in this book because the authors  are clearly not Beanbag Punchers, but nothing about my management sytle has  benfitted from this book.<br />Furthermore, the fictional approach of the book  (I'm assuming the underlying story is fictional) is borderline  condescending.  Its tone is similar to the grade school books your  10-year-old reads to learn good manners.<br />However, the book is reasonably  priced and very short reading, so you may enjoy its content based on the  effort you'll expend.  The theories expressed are unique and thought  provoking.<br />Bottom line:<br />If you want to learn how to be a better  manager, this book isn't your answer.<br />If you want to explore news ways to  manage people, it's worth a quick read.
0451452739|5.0|Kubrick's movie was groundbreaking, original and did a lot to establish space movies as a genre.  But, like most post-Strangelove Kubrick, it did so at the expense of a narrative.  In the book, Clarke takes care of such  mundane matters as givign the reader an idea of what's going on.  Indeed,  the book is more visionary than the movie in many ways.  Clarke's brief  discussion of the aliens' history -- from biological creatures, to robotic  intelligences, to something far greater -- is the sort of thing Ray  Kurzweil writes happily about (and Bill Joy writes unhappily about) today.   But Clarke wrote it over 30 years ago.  As usual, he was ahead of his time.
B00004TL21|5.0|This album is a must need for everyone...The Deftones are getting better and better from an album to another...It seems that their sound is always evoluting...if you enjoyed Adrenaline and Around the fur, you will love  this one...A lot of energetic songs, with heavy and slow parts very well  mixed...So, stop reading this review and buy it, you won't be  disappointed...Deftones RULES!
B00004TL21|5.0|This cd is not disappointing. After waiting 4 1/2 years after loving AROUND THE FUR and ADRENALINE, I was hoping the best from WHITE PONY. I was wrong. It's even better than best.  The disc opens up with a song called  &quot;Felticeria&quot;, which is a straight-through rock song with no  chorus. Hey, it's original. &quot;Digital Bath&quot; I predict will end up  being the song that makes Deftones a breakthrough band. However,  &quot;Elite&quot; marks my favorite on the album, along with  &quot;Passenger&quot; (which duets with Tool/ A Perfect Circle singer  Maynard) and &quot;Changes.&quot; Even the song &quot;Teenager&quot; ,  though mellow, was still excellent. In my opinion, the only real misfire on  &quot;WHITE PONY&quot; was the song &quot;Pink Maggit&quot; which is long,  and stupid. But, overall, this album is a sure keeper. So, what are you  waiting for? Buy it!
B00003XB8K|5.0|I do not know how music can be so powerfull and remain in controll at the same time. Enigma returns once again to amaze us with extraordinary, unique music. If you love Enya and Adimus...you will love Enigma!
B00003Q43A|4.0|Okay, it's not Shakespeare. But there's something about sitting in a cool  dark theater on a hot summer day, watching big budget special effects.    ID-4 is as much a thrill-ride as a movie, and by those standards it  succeeds wonderfully! Many people pick on the plotline. I actually found it  clever how Devlin/Emmerich &amp; company managed to take so many movie  cliches, toss them into the blender, and come up with the mother of all  summer movies: this fast moving, expertly paced explosion-thon. The  extended edition adds a few extra character scenes which don't slow the  movie &amp; add an occasional tweak to grab the attention of fans who  thought they saw it all before. The bigger/better your home theater system,  the more you (and your neighbors!) will get from this DVD. Turn down the  lights, put on some popcorn, lower the A.C. and crank up the volume! Enjoy!
B00004T9UF|4.0|i have his cd and it is good i guess. the songs have too much swears in them and i feel that he needs to stop that a little bit. his music shows that eminem is the top rapper around. this cd has songs that will raise the  hair on the top of your head. well go out and buy this cd because this  rappa got somethang.
B00004TL21|5.0|A very interesting release from a great band. White Pony shows the different ways this band can go with their music, yet still stay truthful to dedicated fans of old. A definate must buy for the year 2000.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I have been a loyal follower of eminem since I fist heard him, and i think this is his best work ever.  I went out and bought this cd the first week it came out and I still can't put it down. This by far beats his last cd, something I previously thought impossible. The lyrics are EXTREMELY funny,  and will keep you laughing for hours. You should defenatly buy this cd. One  of my personal favorites is the song called &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, it is  one of the funniest things I have ever heard. It is defenitly worth the  money.
B00000K2UX|5.0|Well I must say I liked this album. I think that all teh songs are upbeat and show the music of the age. With all the pop icons ruling the airwaves it's nice to know there is a good compilation of 80's music. You've Got  That Lovin' Feelin is not 80's but still is worth a listen since it was one  of the main Top Gun songs.
014028009X|5.0|V.v. good read.  A book that truly does make you laugh out loud and feel good that others go through the same things that we usually only share with our closest friends.  I highly recommend.
0716703440|5.0|If you are drawn to this heavy subject, this is the book for you! The introductory chapter, &quot;The Parable Of The Apple&quot; (&quot;Geometrodynamics In Brief&quot;) alone is worth the price of  admission! Any serious student of gravitation MUST follow his/her local  geodesic into this oribit! But seriously, this massive volume will be a  necessity for any student of this weighty subject for years to come,  regardless of present or future deviations in our knowledge base from it's  contents. This book will long be noted as the first encyclopedia of the  subject, and a very successful one at that!
B00004TL21|5.0|I think this is one of the really best albums i have heard in a long, long time! <br />The style is excellent!  And i love them. T&amp;hey dare to make real music, not just some ripp of stuff you find all to much of now a  days! <br />I give this top score without a doubt! 1 Deftones  rule!
B00000J6AG|5.0|I think Moby is one of the few people whose remixes I appreciate, but Play brings out a whole new side of this talented individual. Play will appeal to a broad audience, especially people who love trip-hop, dance, and/or  electronica. Porcelain and South Side are my favorites.
B00004RFFM|2.0|I personally have nothing against murderous super-sharks, but this offering was rather poor. This movie did not deliver on any genre. As a horror, it was not scary, as a thriller it was too predictable, as a comedy it was not funny, and as a drama it was simply ludicrous. I was surprised  when the chef got away the first time, but this essentially meant he would  make it to the end, which eliminated any future thought of a twist.<br />On a  positive note, I did quite like the soundtrack. I would say that was the  best aspect of the movie. ... I was impressed by the way they  explained away the non-sensical attack of the sharks, even though it made  little more sense than the rest of the movie, it gave an original  reason.<br />Overall, this movie is not one for a second viewing, and the only  excuse for any who hasn't seen it yet to watch it would be extreme boredom  combined with morbid curiousity.
B000000XB9|5.0|I've always heard some of CCR's songs on the radio growing up (in the 80s and early 90s).  I would hear, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;, and &quot;Down on the Corner&quot;.  I had to get this CD  because I loved those songs.  Once I got it I realized that had so many  great songs it was amazing.  &quot;Green River&quot;,  &quot;Commontion&quot;, &quot;Run through the Jungle&quot;.  I had heard of  most of these but I did not realize that CCR sang these songs, so I was  very pleasantly surprised when I listened to this entire CD.  This is one  of those CDs that you can put in and listen to all the way through.  And  don't worry, you can listen to it with your parents too, although they  probabaly already own it!
B00004TL21|5.0|The new Deftone's cd, White Pony is great but the other 2 cds were a little better.  My favorite songs are street carp and pink magot.  Even though its not as good as the other cds i would still suggest to buy it and  see what you think. Im glad I got it.  The band is  a lot better than  before because they got a new band member.  Chino is just as good as  before,, but the music isnt quit as enjoying to listen to.
630587493X|2.0|I was very disappointed and disturbed by this film. It wasn't my choice, but as a fan of Robin Williams, I decided I would give it a chance. The first 45 minutes of the film is good.  The Martin's get the new  &quot;Robot&quot; who the Pepsi girl accidently names Andrew.  Andrew is a  unique, one of a kind robot who deep down really wants to be human and  mortal. Immortaliy stinks for him. The film moves through different periods  of the families' life, and brings us to almost 200 years later, and Andrew  is still trying to become more human.  he even falls in love with a human,  and she, although she knows it could never really work, falls in love with  him too.  well, she never really declares her love.  but they spend time  together, and this is where the film starts to disturb me, a machine and a  woman are just happily in love?  and people are watching this with their  children?  i would never watch this with children, or recommend it to  families.  This is just a strange story, with some real philosophical  questions being asked. I really wouldn't call this movie Science Fiction.  It's kind of a comedy in the beginning, and then it just turns to mush.   The acting couldn't even save this movie.  Robin Williams is the only star  in this waste of film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I'm not typically a fan of this kind of music but I love this album and would recommend it to virtually anyone - no matter what your taste....buy it, you'll like it.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Savage Garden is definitely one of the best pop bands, for my opinion. Unlike other artists (which I like and appreciate), they add a special touch to their music.<br />I must admit, some songs here seemed a bit off for my opinion. I prefer to define Savage Garden as a \\"silent music\\" band, but The Animal Song and Affirmation (the song) made me a bit puzzled. Those songs should've been taken off of the CD.<br />If I must choose, I would say \\"Two Beds & A Coffee Machine\\" is the best song for this CD, following it must be \\"You can still be free\\".<br />Each song can bring you memories, and I would highly recommend this album to anyone.
B00004TL21|5.0|My answer...yes...hell yes....this has to be one of the best cd's i have ever listened to, each song just builds upon the next.  The album starts off mid-range, then gets heavy, softens up on Teenager, then blows back to  heavy with korea.  There is just something for everyone on this album, from  the softened dynamics of digital bath to the haunting of passenger and  change.  My only real complaint is that they changed the song Pink Maggot  to a softer version, rather than the rap-metal version that was on the  internet a few months ago.  But it is still great.  If your in to heavy  music, you will love it, and if your into more softer, more mellow and deep  music, you will love it still.  For us longtime deftones fans, the time has  come to show the world just what a musical force they are, and they do it  in style.  Great album guys, I look forward to catching you on the road  this summer.
B00004TL21|5.0|I THINK THIS NEW ALBUM MAY NOT BE LIKE THEIR OLD ONE'S BUT IT SURE HAS DEFTONES FELL IN IT AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS. IF THEY DON'T COME UP WITH NEW SOUNDS THEN THEY'RE JUST GONNA GET BORING TO THE PEOPLE AND THEY'LL STOP LISTENING. I LOVE ALL OF THEIR MUSIC, ANYTHING THAT COMES FROM THEM HAS TO  BE GOOD AND THEY HAVE NOT LET ME DOWN YET. IF YOU ARE A TRUE DEFTONES FAN  YOU'LL ENJOY THIS CD.
B0000027RL|5.0|my favorite bands are nothing like Pearl Jam... KMFDM, Metallica, Eels, Garbage.  But still this is easily one of my favorite 5 CDs of all time.  It just can't be described in words... the only one I can think of is  &quot;incredible.&quot;  Some of the songs, like Once and Deep, are fast  paced and heavy... they kick your butt.  Some are slow and somber, like  Black and Garden... they make you sit and think, or even cry.  How did they  do it?  Beats me, but it makes for a great album.  the true mark of  greatness:  the two biggest singles from the album (Alive and Jeremy) are  actually the weakest spots on the album... and they're still great songs!   my personal favorites are Once, Black, Garden, and Release Me... I  personally enjoy the thoughtful, slower-paced aspect of the album more than  its harder parts.  But those parts are still great.  Unfortunately, it  seems that Pearl Jam shot their artistic load with this album; every other  CD they've managed to put out since then has been unadulterated filth.  The  solution, however, is easy... just ignore all their other albums, but by  all means, RUN OUT AND BUY THIS ONE!  You won't be sorry.
B00004TL21|4.0|I beleive that if you are a fan of rock or deftones, you would definetly love this cd. it is the best stuff from the deftones i have heard so far.
B00004TL21|5.0|i found this cd to be their best yet. i like the intensity the band puts into each sound, no matter if it is heavy or not so heavy. i especially liked rx queen and passenger. i would definitely recommend this cd to  everyone.
B000031X7T|5.0|If you loved this album on it's first release, just wait until you hear the crowd roar on this live release!  I felt like I was at the concert!  This is a must buy for all of the Floyd fans out there and an awesome  introduction for all new listeners.  You will have no regrets on this  one...
B00004TL21|4.0|The cd is good all around. Fans of Tool and Pantera will think this cd will rock. Its been a while since the last deftones cd.  However, it is well worth the wait.
B000002LQQ|3.0|To me, this album will always be an afterthought in the Dire Straits catalogue, not just because of the long lag between their last original recordings (&quot;Brothers In Arms&quot;) and this, but because it seems to  be a real mish-mash of styles, as if Knopfler rummaged his attic to find  the best collection of tunes that had never made it on an album before.<br />A  lot of what's here is filler (&quot;Heavy Fuel&quot; for example, is the  type of quasi-metal plodder that Knopfler doesn't do very well).  Two  songs, however, are among his best.  &quot;The Bug&quot; is one of those  silly, innocuous toe-tappers (like &quot;Walk Of Life) that you just can't  help feeling uplifted by, despite its inconsequential lyrics.  The closing  track &quot;How Long&quot; shows Knopfler's country sensibilities in an  up-tempo format (think &quot;You're Own Sweet Way&quot; at 78-speed).  The  multiple guitar sounds, including the slide, during the middle solo and  especially at the fade out are simply wonderful.  It's the perfect song to  end the album, and it's the primary reason I've kept &quot;On Any  Street&quot; all this time.
B00000AFFI|4.0|This was my intro to PJ Harvey, and it was a good one.  It's dark and brooding, but elegantly crafted.  I'm definitely a fan due to this CD.  Harvey has a way of capturing a mood that is rare and enchanting.  I'd  recommend it.
0441172717|3.0|This is one of those situations where I actually preferred the movie to the book. Although the book gave much more background than the movie, it was much easier to follow the book after having seen the movie. I think if  I had read the book first, I would have been lost completely. The movie is  also part of my permanent collection. I mean, who could resist Kyle  McLachlan as the Kwizatz Had'arrach?
B00004TL21|5.0|This CD is a little bit different than Deftones other two releases in that it is more multi-layered complex music, than their usual hard-hitting, headbanging beats.     If you want straight anger, check out Deftones other  two releases, Adrenaline and Around the Fur.  But for those who want to go  on a loud, vicious head trip w/ some deliciously soft undertones, go out  and buy this album.     It has great lyrics, beats, grooves, and hooks to  keep you coming back again and again.     This CD has great potential, but  I would not rate it as the best Deftones CD.  Since I like my music REALLY  heavy, I think Adrenaline is the absolute best.  But this disk is  definately worth buying, and a must for any Deftones, Rage Against the  Machine, System of a Down, or Static-X fan.
B00000JPH5|4.0|Also another in my collection. The costumes are just amazing. The old man with the bird on his head that won't stop talking is just a riot. My favourite character will always be the little dog who lives in the bog of  eternal stench.....so remember, should you need us, just call.
B00004TL21|5.0|I bought the White Pony Limited Ed. red disc on the first day it was out.  Believe me, the limited ed. is even better than the regular version.  It contains an extra track that will absolutely blow you away.       If you are new to Deftones, first get aquainted w/ them by picking up a copy of  Adrenaline, since it usually is pretty cheap. Then you know what to expect,  and won't feel ripped off by buying the limited ed. or the regular.   Deftones have a very unique sound.  They can explode your speakers w/  groundshaking sound, or mellow out w/ a catchy little tune.  Chino Moreno's  (lead singer) voice can go from frighteningly calm to pshycotic-like  raving.  The whole rest of the band just flat out rules.     The thing I  like about these guys best is that, unlike Korn or Limp Bizket, they don't  turn into a stupid, R &amp; B band for the rest of the CD after you've  heard the killer single.  They offer insane, inventive, darkly humorous  thrashing rock throughout the whole disk.     This CD is great the whole  way through, as always w/ Deftones.  If you like this you might want to try  Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, or Static-X.
B00000ICD9|4.0|Although the use of colour and images is phenomenal in this movie, the plot seemed a bit hard to follow at times. The character of Cuba G. Jr. was difficult to follow until closer to the end. Parts of the movie made me  cry, others made me laugh. It's definately a feel good movie.
B00004TL21|4.0|What a great idea, take break-neck gutairs and hip-hop beats, and combine them with acctual emotion!  This album stands out as the first great masterpiece (excluding the work of Rage Against the Machine, Cypress Hill,  and Primus who have always done outstanding stuff) of the rap-metal genera,  and genra i myself have been very critical of.  Its hard to imagine Fred  Durst belting out the kind of tunes that are presented here, emotional,  hartfelt, and vulnrible. More Robert Smith, then Jonathan Davis, but the  Deftones pull it off.  The music is great to, what set Rage apart from the  crap bands was the guitar heroics of Tom Marello, and these are up there  too.  The album is by no means perfect, but it is a step in the right  derection for a music style known for misogynie, bigotry, and Homophobia  towards the ideals of the grunge area.  Lets hope those morons Limpbizkit,  and there never ending army of copycats can pay attention!
B000002W9Q|2.0|I must be the only person who absolutely hated this movie, but didn't mind the sound track. I actually don't think I've seen the movie all the way through, though I've been to Lake Lure where it was filmed...pretty place.  But back to the soundtrack.....first song, a classic, and who could forget  patrick swayze singing his own little song there :) Otherwise, the songs  are older than me...and really don't interest me :)
B00004TL21|4.0|i am a huge fan of the deftones.  and i did have some apprehension about this album.  However, i bought it yesterday and it's really good.  I'm not so sure if it's chino singing in the middle of Knife Party.  If it is, it's  amazing.  collaboration with Maynard is made less exciting by boring music.   vocal effect on track 3 will make you want to rip your eyes out (not in a  good way) it's THAT irritating. Lyrics like &quot;Here's my new address:  664...oh i forget&quot; really made me worry when i first heard the  internet bootleg version, but once again, deftones manage to rock.  This  album may take a little getting used to like Incubus' &quot;Make  Yourself&quot; cus it is different.  In my opinion, heavy fans will be  dissappointed with tracks like &quot;digital bath&quot; and track 2, but  feiticeira, street carp, and change, will remind fans of why they fell in  love with the deftones a while ago.
B00003CXDV|4.0|Also another one for my collection. S. Weaver looks especially hot in this one with blonde hair and a chest that doesn't stop. Very entertaining aliens they encounter, love the playoffs on star trek. The character of Guy  Flegman is definately the plucky comic relief :)
B00004U8PA|5.0|This is an unbelieveable cult classic. The plot is incredible and the lyrics to the songs stay in your head for weeks. I caught the &quot;Rocky Horror fever&quot; many months ago and there is nothing stopping me from  watching this film and listening to the soundtrack. Many big name stars  appear in this film: Susan Surrandon (Dead Man Walking), Barry Bostwick  (Spin City), and Tim Currey (Clue). This is a movie that you will love  until the day you did. Enjoy the Time Warp!
B00004THAY|3.0|This album is generally good, but when you compare it to Live at the Regal, or John Lee Hooker's the Healer, its not even in the same league.  BB King's older music is by far his most powerful, because it is less  polished and produced and more raw. This is too commercial for my taste.
B00004TL21|4.0|In the deftones new album, White Pony, they take a more melodic route, then the smash and fuzz hardcore of the first two albums. Although this smoother more mature method of guitar and drum is flowing while also  pumping adrenaline into your veins, you dont know its happening but  slowly...it does. Better than adrenaline, as good as Around the Fur,  Deftones make no mistake in progressing, and trying new amazing things. The  album also feature a guest appearance by Tool and Perfect Circle vocalist  Maynard James Keenan. Best song: Change (in the house of flies) --their  first single I might add. Final Analysis: A-
B00004THAY|5.0|The other reviews say it all, from one perspective to another, the consensus is this album is a winner! One reviewer remarked that it would be a Grammy contender. That was my thought exactly on my second listen  through. When Eric stated 5 years ago that he was going to go the  &quot;Blues&quot; route, I hoped he meant it. Not that I did not like  Pilgrim, I do, but you have to appreciate it with its Curtis Mayfield  flavor. Riding with the King is the direction Clapton has to go in. He can  do more for himself and other Blues greats by making the rounds and playing  on disc or live with as many as he can. This not only continues the work  begun with From the Cradle, but takes it to an entirely new level. Bravo EC  and BB!
B0000024W3|5.0|how does an album of this stature take such harsh review? it is filled with magnificent emotional songs such as &quot;early mornin' rain&quot;, &quot;livin the blues&quot;, &quot;blue Moon&quot;  and many others. Don't  listen to the reviews of critics who only want a Dylan that meets the  cliches of his early career.  A true artist can output in all dirrections  and thats exactly what he does. This album is bursting with sincerity like  all of Bob's albums.  I'm only 17 and Ilove it. Thats why modern music is  lacking merit because it lacks sincerity. If a modern artist relaesd an  album with even a quarter as much sincerity it would be great and  worthwhile.  This is a truly great album and I recommend it to anyone!
B000002WYT|5.0|A very special person led me to DMB, and I have been forever grateful. Say goodbye is a song that gives me the chills...i couldnt love it more, and what the lyrics say, just reminds me of one of the dearest persons in my  life....buddy, thank you for leading me into this, and for all music  lovers, this is REAL MUSIC! Enjoy it, and let yourselves go.....Dave..you  are too much!
B00004TL21|5.0|Unlike most of the &quot;new-metal&quot; bands that are appearing everywhere as a result of this type of music's recent mainstream success, the Deftones have been together for 13 years, creating and refining a sound  that is all their own. Like their good friends in KoRn, the Deftones are  constantly building on their acomplishments of the past, just so that they  can stay one or two steps ahead of all those bands who are looking to copy  them. In my opinion, the thing that makes the Deftones better than such  bands as Rage Against The Machine, is their ability to improve with each  record. &quot;Adrenaline&quot; was an amazing first effort, full of the  aggresion and emotion filled lyrics that make this music so incredible.  After two years of waiting, fans were hit with &quot;Around The Fur,&quot;  an album that showcased such amazing songs as Shove It, Headup, Be Quiet  &amp; Drive, and Mascara. After these two albums, the Deftones had built a  large underground following, but they had very little comercial success.  After touring in Ozzfest, the Deftones were ready to explore a more  feminine side to their music. Their latest release, &quot;The White  Pony,&quot; also reflects where they are right now in their lives. After  growing up and becoming family men, they have learned to mellow out .....  making it harder to be so angry at the world. Just like &quot;Around The  Fur&quot; was a great improvement, so is &quot;The White Pony.&quot; This  is one of those album that you can listen to straight through, as you fall  in love with every song. I highly recomend that you buy this cd. My  favorite tracks are, Pink Maggit, Passenger, Knife Party, Feiticeira, and  Korea. Other killer bands to look for are, (hed)p.e., Factory 81, Incubus,  Crazy Town, MachineHead, Taproot, Insolence, and Project 86!
B000021Y7X|4.0|With Stop Making Sense, David Byrne &amp; company set out to deconstruct concert films. Instead of the entire band coming onstage at once, they enter one-at-a-time, song-by-song - until there are close to a dozen people  onstage. Not only does the number of people onstage grow, but also does the  intensity of the music. The only low point is a not-so-good performance by  the Tom Tom Club, but hey, it's after that that David walks out in the, now  infamous &quot;big suit&quot;. The audience is only show once or twice in  quick, panning shots. A great finger in the face of every other concert  film ever made. This is what happens when the geeks in the Audio/Visual  club form a band and set out to conquer the world.
6305807086|3.0|I had heard so much about this film and i was an admirer of Spike Jonze's music videos, Sabotage, And Praise you by Fatboy Slim, i thought were both hilarious.  So i was expecting a bit of the same, and defintely received  it.  The beginning of the film is hilarious, the speech impediment  secretary i thought was great, and the 7.5 floor was hilarious as well.   The other amazing things to this film was the puppeteering, incredible, i  never knew it could be so artistic.  And of course when he discovers the  portal for the first time, and is thrown out on the new jersey turnpike.  I  was gripped, ready for a good funny film.  Unfortunately i was disappointed  because the film became too serious and intellectual, with the women posing  as vicarious lesbians through malkovich, and relating through someone else.   I don't know i found it a bit too depressing, when i thought it could have  been really funny and quirky, ala Gilliam.  The other thing that bothered  me was the logic of the portals, the Dr. &quot;found&quot; a portal and has  been living in a portal to extend his life, and has brought some friends  along to live in Malkovich, which i didn't really understand...Can more  than one person live in a person?  And then the notion that you will be  trapped in a childs mind if you don't get into the portal confused me as  well, because i was wondering, okay you are confined to look through a  child's eyes, but you have no power over the child, but in Malkovich you  possess him? and have power over him?,...gotta a little lost on some of the  logic here...was a bit too confusing.  As far as originality it was a great  film, amazing concept, but the turns of the storyline just bugged and  depressed me.  And i'm not afraid of stranger films, one of my fav is Time  Bandits but this film just didn't go in a direction that appealed to me, it  lacked fun.
B00000BIBQ|5.0|this album is just a mix of great music and superb words: yes, the story is definitely one of the most beautiful ever. the unique lyricism of Phil May and the genius of the Pretties' music make this album a myth of the  60's!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears is ssssoooooo much more talented than before. Many of the songs on this album are very inspirational, especially to young girls. I like the songs Lucky, What U See (Is What U Get), and, of course, oops...I  did it again. Those aren't the only good songs on that cd, but it depends  on what your music taste is. All the songs on this cd are good for  different types of tastes.
B00004TL21|4.0|The Deftones previous albums were very rap and korn orientated.  This album has many new ideas which have made this album.  Chino, the front man of deftones wanted a more sexy feel to this album. This album has followed  his idea with smooth flowing fast distorted riffs.  It has more of a mellow  feel to the songs.  &quot;Elite&quot; is however an edgy song much like a  more heavier song from before.  The main differences with this album is the  new &quot;evolved&quot; style within the band, seperating themselves even  further from korn and limp bizkit.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I first heard Moby on an ad for MTV.  It was a strange ad.  It started off with a cross-country team running in the heat and then a bunch of kids laughing at them.  Then &quot;BodyRock&quot; came on and they showed scenes  of teenager's lives.  The end said, &quot;The Rhythem of Being Young.&quot;    It showed teenagers lives so well.  Then when the music hits its climax  the commercial game me chills.  I asked a friend who this was and she said  Moby.  I knew that I had to get this album..using our good friend Napster,  we retrieved it quickly.  EVERY SONG GAVE ME CHILLS.  &quot;porcelain&quot;  &quot;Rushing&quot; &quot;BodyRock&quot; &quot;My Weakness&quot; are  awesome.  I can listen to them and if i am  doin anything i have to stop  because they make me think about life so much.  The way that Moby has added  blues,techno, and the gospel lyrics is a great combination.  &quot;My  Weakness&quot; has a background of children and then the instrumental part  is so powerful.  I have never listened to previous Moby, but I love this  and recommend it to any person who likes music that makes them think about  life.
B00004TL21|5.0|The Deftones have made their second smash hit... Change (In the House Of Flies.)  It is similar to the first &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It).&quot;  If you are a fan of the Deftones, Hard Rock/Metal or even hip-hop, you  should go out and buy this album.  It is just as good as the other ones.   White Pony keeps the Deftones one of a kind style alive and is a great  album.  I've had it for 18 hours and it is already one of my favorite  albums I own.
B00004TL21|5.0|The Deftones have to be one of the best groups in todays standards...with their catchy songs like (change) or their other titles...you can't go wrong.  This isn't as good as their past cd's but its write up there.  You  can't go wrong...
B00004TL21|4.0|The Deftones have a new smash hit Change (In The House Of Flies) which is similar to their previous hit My Own Summer (Shove It.) I bought their new cd one hour after it hit shelves and it is already one of my favorite cd's.   If you are a fan of the Deftones, hard rock/metal or even hip-hop go out  and buy this album!   White Pony has kept the Deftones one of a kind style  alive in the music industry
B00004TL21|5.0|It's been almost two years since the Deftones put out a new album, but it was definetly worth the wait. If you're looking for the loud, grinding metal sound of their first two albums then you might be disappointed, but  the one heavy song &quot;Elite&quot; should satisfy you. For the rest of  the album you can expect a heavy droning guitar combined with melodies from  frontman Chino Moreno. He finally showed everyone that he can sing too, and  can he ever sing. This album resembles Depeche Mode a little bit. You  wouldn't expect such a sound from the Deftones, but the mixture of guitars  and Chino's newfound singing ability definetly have the resemblance of  Depeche Mode, just trade the pop for heavy guitars. The addition of Frank  Dlegado on the turntables gives an unexpected surprise to this album. Its  not the Korn or Limp Bizkit rap/metal thing(thank goodness), but more  samples used to accent the hard work these guys put into this album. If you  are a fan of the old Deftones then you might not enjoy this album, but if  you're a die-hard fanatic then you can appreciate the progression that this  band has made, establishing themselves as one of the premiere metal bands  around
B00004TL21|4.0|Well, since Adrenaline hit shelves 6 years ago and I saw them at the Warped Tour that year, I never pinned the Deftones as a group that would incorporate samples of ambience into their songs.  Nevertheless,  &quot;White Pony&quot; defied my prejudice and did so with incredible  results.  The songs on this album are, for the most part, more  &quot;mellow&quot; than the groups previous efforts.  However, the rage  that is found in the Deftones lyrics this time around more than makes up  for the lack of distortion and Chino Moreno's whisper-shout routine.  The  songs have an emotion that seems to be lacking in so much seemingly  fabricated music, which is possibly the best part of listening to the new  album.  It is nice to know that there are still one or two bands who are  not compelled to blurt out useless insults and obscenities and call them  songs.  One of these bands is The Deftones, and their honesty is refreshing  to anyone who may feel that music today is nothing but 18-year old  Mouseketeers and four or five boys crooning on how they miss their  girlfriends.
B00003W8NM|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film on VCD when it came out. I admire its satire on pretentious commercialism of America. Brad Pitt does a fairly good job with his masculine violence but Edward Norton has to the most  talented actor in Hollywood right now. Since his stint in Rounders, no one  can duplicate his ironic voice and low-key acting which is quite  naturalistic. Edward Norton deserved an Oscar nomination.<br />Bonham-Carter  is quite aloof in this movie. This could be good or bad depending on how  you want to look at it.<br />Fight Club is a great film which I will admit is  a lovely satire on American values. It's a hard bitter pill to swallow  especially if you use a credit card like me (blowing up credit card  buildings) but it has a point. We are drugged on our culture!
0449002632|4.0|I enjoyed London much more in its early stages - while the families and their predicaments truly fascinated me and held my interest as they interwove with the historical aspects.  After about 600 pages, however, the  constant repetition of families, characteristics, and the way their  surroundings affected them began to lose their initial thrill to me.  I  finished the book and still have good feelings for it, but the novelty  definitely wore off after a bit.
6304913176|3.0|ok!  so it isn't the best scrip in the world.. But the story will hold just enough to get you to the action.. this is not a big movie for thought but it is a fun ride!
B000005YZM|5.0|When I first bought the record in 1968, and listened to it, I thought &quot;What is this?&quot;.  I listened to it a second and third time, and I was hooked.  What makes this recording so timeless is how little it related  to the definition of &quot;hit&quot; at the time it was recorded (with the  exception of &quot;Time of the Season&quot;), yet how listenable it is  today.  My initial reaction when I first heard this, was that I didn't  understand this music.  Eventually, I realized why.  The Zombies' final  recording was so far ahead of its time, that the world of rock music had to  grow up to catch up with them.  I can listen to this today, and it sounds  modern.  Marvelously tight harmonies, minor key arrangements, and wonderful  syncopation make this still one of my all-time favorite albums.

6305750750|3.0|To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this movie when I went to see it in theaters.  While some people were waiting in lines weeks to get to see it and had prophecies of it being the best piece of film ever made, I  figured it could go either way.  The first thing I noticed from the  previews was that they seemed to rely heavily on the special effects, at  least as far as the sales pitch.  The previews were basically a collection  of the best eye-candy in the movie.  This observation still held true after  I saw it.  Think about the first 3 Star Wars movies and how little they  relied on special effects yet still created heavy doses of awe.  This movie  tends to rely too heavily on the special effects, which adds very little to  the movie and creates that horribly cliched &quot;Episode 1 was made for  little kids&quot; line.  What I don't understand when I hear someone say  this is why they think this is any different.  The original Star Wars  trilogy could have been just as easily entertaining to children as to  adults, a rare feat indeed.  There is so much I could say about the movie  but I will sum it up with saying this.  The movie is a good prequel but  that is it.  Imagine *just* watching A New Hope.  You had to see the other  2 to get the effect.  I'm sure when the other 2 are released in 2042 the  series will be just as enjoyable.  The lowpoint of the movie were the  characters.  Some were hatable (Jar Jar), others underdeveloped (Young  Anakin), some just there for old times sake adding nothing to the story  (Jabba), and others were inconsistent with the original (Qui-Gon).  The  highlight was Queen Amidala - well acted, memorable costume.  Maybe the  movie was made for Lucas' kid.  Maybe it was just another Hollywood ploy  because Lucas' bank account is running dry.  Whatever it may be, it's still  an average movie that does and will add something to this classic  storyline.
B000002OOY|5.0|I own a plethora of movie soundtracks, many of them by John Williams, and this one stands out as one of my favorites.  The main theme that is introduced in Track 2 is a beautiful, sweeping melody backed up by full  orchestral harmony.  The other recurring theme (I can't remember off the  top of my head which track it first appears in) is a grand triumphant piece  that has a similar feel to the Indiana Jones theme, also by Williams.  The  rest of the score perfectly conveys the action and tension of the movie.  I  could listen to this album every day and not get tired of it.  Brilliant.
B000000OE7|4.0|This is without a doubt Queen's most reflective album,which is not surprising considering that Freddie knew that he didn't have that much more time to live. Some of Queens songs on Innuendo and Made in Heaven are the  most emotional stuff you could ever hear.However one star has to be removed  because of the truly hideous &quot;You Don't fool Me&quot; Why on earth has  this song become so popular? It sounds like a second rate disco song that  you would hear in a nightclub in Majorca! It is truly a shame that it had  to be included on this otherwise emotional album.
0393316041|5.0|Richard Feynman's book is full of energy and funny anecdotes.  His love for physics and understanding/tinkering with the simplest of things (like padlocks and ants, and even the behavior of people around him) is very  entertaining.  It's inspiring to read about someone who loves his work and  applies it to everyday things.
0553573403|5.0|This book, as well as the second in the series is totally and completely engulfing.  The method of storytelling creates an environment that is practically inescapable.  Each chapter follows one character and then  leaves them at a crucial moment.  But you don't care about leaving because  you're anxious to find out what's happening in the next chapter.  Because  of this you can't put the book down.  You keep thinking &quot;Just one more  chapter.&quot;  The only criticism I have of the series is IT'S NOT  FINISHED!  I can't wait for more books, and waiting three years between  books is difficult.  My only suggestion is to put this on your TO READ list  and then wait for the series to be completed.  Waiting for the next book is  agony.  800 pages reads like 200.  They'll go fast.  And then you'll be  left wanting more.
B00004TL21|5.0|This album is great. The tempo is slowed a bit, but it's still enjoyable. Best Tracks: Knife Party, Teenager, Pink Maggit, Korea and Passenger.
B00000JCOV|5.0|It's amazing how many kids hate Limp Bizkit in my school. Thank god for SlipKnot, now everykid likes SLipKnot now. ANd they're not sellouts either!  Their image is awesome, Nine lunatics with masks, boiler suits,  feel no pain, and scary as he! . Their music is even better, (Sic) is an  awesome way to begin a cd that i didnt know much about. The Eyeless, which  was awesome, and Wait and bLeed, the reason i bought the cd. Then  SUrfacing, the best song on this CD. SPit it out, a catchy song is pretty  cool. Then Tattered and Torn, i wasn't crazy about it, so i dont really  listen to it much. Me Inside was an alright song. Liberate is awesome, and  Prosthetics is creepy. Then the CD gets awesome, No Life and DIluted, and  Only one explode right in your face, and Scissors is a cool way to end it  publicly, and Eyore is a funny song for a hidden track. The reason the  music is great is because each member is a master of their istruments,  Corey, a singer, knows how to work the microphone. He can sing a low note  or scream at the top of his lungs and still make thousands of fans mosh pit  and headbang. <br />Mick, is the guitarist, #7. He plays the awesome opening  to Eyeless using freaky effects on a effects pedal, and plays most songs.  He is a friggin' giant, and he wears a hockey mask and loves Serial  Killers.<br />Shawn, an odd Drummer, with a clown mask, plays titanium drums.  He gives awesome percussion, like in Wait and bleed, and Prosthetics. He   is also crazy too. He always fights with their DJ, and gets injured many  times in Live shows. <br />Craig, a sampler, wears a helmet drenched in nails.  He is also a giant. He gives freaky sound effects for songs like Eyeless  and Prosthetics, and Tattered and Torn. No one goes near him when he's  headbanging.<br />James, a guitarist, wears a jester mask with a zipper mouth.  And has his hair showing out of the mask. He plays impressive  &quot;pumping&quot; type guitar riffs that are lightning fast. Like in Sic,  Wait and Bleed, and Surfacing are his most obvious works. <br />Chris, a  drummer who has a pinnochio mask, and admires Picaso. His drumming style is  awesome, and he looks cool when he headbangs. He has a cool part in Wait  and bLeed.<br />Paul, a bassist, who wears a pig mask, is a master of Bass. He  is quiet, and not a big part of concerts. But he plays cool riffs like in  the beggining of SIC, and surfacing.<br />Joey, a drummer, wears a white mask  with black hair and red hi lights coming out of them. He is the lead  drummer, and drums in all of the songs. he is short, and he dawns #1,  because he is in charge of all the guitar and drum work.<br />Sid, a DJ, wears  a gas mask and isnt in a lot of songs, but you can hear him in Surfacing,  and Eyeless. He hates Shawn. At a concert he jumped 30 feet into the crowd  and injured a fan.<br />Buy SLipKnot now!
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles had an incredible knack for making musical pastiches which worked fine as parodies but which also displayed such mastery of the genres they were lampooning that each song is a legitimate jewel of its genre at  the same time. With this lengthy album, the Beatles showcased this amazing  habit by taking on just about every style in rock's book. The effect can be  overwhelming for fans whose tastes are narrow and who find they may like  some songs but not others; the Beatles were so eclectic that they outrun  the ears of many. If this is the case, you should spend some time studying  this album until your education is up to speed. Funny, poignant,  outrageous, beautiful, experimental, and highly imaginative work is to be  found here, all in the same classic album.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is simply the best. I have to put it in  the same category as Star Wars movies ( not the last one! ). You watch it over and over again, but the facination never goes away. Now, that's what we called  &quot;art&quot;. If you have a DVD player, get this. If you don't, get the  VHS version. It will change your whole attitude. Laurence Fishburne is the  best! Are dreams real, or is reality a dream?
0140277447|2.0|There seems little doubt that far too many Chinese civilians were unnecessarily killed in Nanjing during WWII.<br />To say that this was a &quot;holocaust&quot; in which 300,000+ people were slaughtered smacks of  Beijing's perennial propaganda campaign.  The communist regime has  blackmailed Japan for decades based on this &quot;history&quot; to extract  various economic handouts.  Today most serious scholars around the world  believe the Nanjing death toll was closer to tens of thousands and, though  horrifying enough, did not come even remotely close to the scale of the  European holocaust.<br />Besides this is a claim of the government that still  teaches its school children that the Korean War began as a result of an  invasion by &quot;American imperialist devils&quot; and that the Chinese  and North Koreans fought back &quot;in self-defense&quot;.<br />Frightening  indeed.
B000023VR6|5.0|This album is in one word awesome.  I rarely come upon an album that from the first listen to I love and just keep playing it over and over again.  But this album definitely does that.  It is already one of my favorite rap  albums of all time, maybe in my top 5 and quickly becoming one of my all  time favorite albums period.  Not all of the songs are spectacular but  there is definitely enough here to make it worth it and there isn't a  single one that I skip on a regular basis.  Of course, &quot;Still  Dre&quot; is a great song, with a catchy beat and nice flows.  &quot;What's  The Difference?&quot; is also one of my favorites on this album with some  creative lyrics thrown in by Eminem.  &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot; well if  you haven't heard that by now where have you been?  A really good song even  after a 100 listens.  &quot;The Next Episode&quot; is another great tune,  and &quot;Housewife&quot; will have you cracking up.  Overall this is  probably the best rap album of this year and the past year, hard hitting  with a lot of good rhymes and great beats.
B00003CXDV|4.0|Isn't it great when actors can laugh at themselves and encourage others to do the same? Isn't it even better when a parody actually salutes the genre parodied and acknowledges the fans?<br />This is a good funny movie. A simple  plot (actors mistaken by an alien race under threat to be real characters.  Same actors help to defeat the bad guys and gain self-belief) and some  wonderful situations (made all the better for being so predictable).<br />The  stereotypes are played wonderfully: a nasty baddy with 'his' dumb cohorts,  Sigourney Weaver playing a token sex symbol so well indeed (compare her  character to Ripley for goodness sake - this is such a change), Tony  Shaloub playing the engineer and Tim Allen playing the Kirk character with  the same integrity and courage that Shatner tried to portray in his own  way. <br />Perhaps best of all is Alan Rickman whose jaded Dr Lazarus is  transformed into a the real TV character after all.<br />Whatever you want  from a movie, this can probably supply and it actually makes the first  series of Star Trek better to watch!
B000005H40|4.0|This is an excellent collection of work from a great artist.  Each piece just seems to blend seamlessly into the next one and all of them come together to give you a true taste of what John Coltrane is all about.  I  definitely like the work here better than some of the stuff on &quot;Birth  of Cool..&quot; which is another one of my favorite Coltrane albums, this  sound is just much richer and more haunting in many respects.  Overall a  very good piece of work.
B00003CX5A|4.0|This is Burton at his best. A dark atmospheric tale: stunning visuals combining with a masterful soundtrack from Danny Elfman. <br />Who has been decapitating dignatories in the village of Sleepy Hollow? The authorities  send in Ichabod Crane, a leading edge (well for the 19th Century) forensic  expert and nuisance. The character is wonderfully played by Johnny Depp: a  twitchy and effete character initialy out of his depth but later to find  steely resolve.<br />As you would expect layer upon layer of intrigue and  mystery is played out by some great characters. Michael Gambon, Miranda  Richardson, Christopher Walken, Ian McDiarmid, Cristina Ricci, Michael  Gough amongst others bring this bleak tale a quirky humour and darkness  that is absolute Burton.  <br />For being a tale about a headless horsemen  decapitating his way through a village most of it is surprisingly goreless  (imagine what Peckinpah or Woo would do) although there are many scenes not  for the faint hearted - particularly towards the end.<br />This is rocking  good fun and although the DVD does not really contain much else, the  movie's plus points make it a good buy.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|This is definitely Rage's best album so far, and it is a delightful mixture of hard rocking tunes, and social commentary.  The first track of the album is just a great song, &quot;Testify&quot; and it continues from  there.  Of course the original single &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot; which has  an awesome video modelled after the Gap ads is truly a great piece of work.  &quot;Mic Check&quot; hits you hard with lots of strong sounds, and  &quot;Sleep now in the Fire&quot; is as soothing as Rage could ever be.  I  think the rhymes have gotten better, the sound has gotten better and  everything's improved.  So why only 4 stars?  Well to tell you the truth,  when it all comes down to it it's still the standard Rage sound, and though  this is the best example of it, it sounds a lot like the other albums.  That aside if you want the best example of that sound ever buy this album.
B000002W5J|5.0|Surrealistic Pillow is the san francisco sound defined. It's a blend of poetic lyricism,supreme  musicianship,and a neverending wave of inspiration. Comin'back to me is a acoustic song filled with poetic imagery  and hypnotic melody. 3/5 of a mile is a flat out rocker. Plastic fantastic  lover is psychedelia with lyrics that transform you into another plane.  Today is a lovely song with romantic words and haunting melody. This album  also includes the overplayed yet essential White rabbit and Somebody to  love. A great album that has impact upon every listen...Essential
B00003CXDV|5.0|Have you ever wondered what would happen if Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and the cast of &quot;Star Trek&quot; actually wound up on the U.S.S. Enterprise?  (There actually was a short story written about just that  subject, but that's for another time.)  That's the premise of &quot;Galaxy  Quest&quot;, absolutely the funniest movie I have seen in a long time.  The  basic plot:  washed-up actors from a cancelled science fiction TV show are  enlisted by aliens to help them in their fight against a genocidal  aggressor.  Tim Allen, who now has played two space cadets (&quot;Buzz  Lightyear&quot;), gives an excellent turn as Jason Nesmith, the  Shatner-esque star of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; who chews the scenery at  every opportunity.  Allen brought a wonderful mixture of camp and honesty  to the role of an actor who actually believed himself to be &quot;the  star&quot; -- until overhearing a conversation that made him doubt his star  status, especially among his friends.  Alan Rickman is funny as the actor  Alexander Dane, who played the alien Dr. Lazarus, and I can just imagine  Leonard Nimoy saying, &quot;If I have to say 'live long and prosper' one  more time, I'll puke!&quot;  That is the attitude Rickman brings to the  role, and he pulls it off convincingly.  Probably the most stunning casting  decision was Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco, who played Lt. Tawny (where  did they get that name?) Madison.  It's hard to play a blonde bimbo,  especially when you're an intelligent actress.  Weaver gives a very  intelligent performance as the intelligent actress whose main assets are  her breasts, and her only job is to parrot the ship's computer.   &quot;Look, I have one job on this lousy ship, it's stupid, but I'm gonna  do it!  Okay?&quot;  The rest of the cast gives excellent, believable  performances, and Sam Rockwell (&quot;Crewman No. 6&quot;) almost steals  the show.  Invite your Trekker friends over to see it...it's worth watching  again and again.
B00000JCOV|5.0|If you ever need something to wake you up from a coma, this album is the way to go.  Get nine angry guys from the middle of nowhere and have them start making music, and the result is the musical equivalent of a  slegehammer to the crotch. If you have an annoying neighbor that blasts  R&amp;B all the time like i do, just start playing this really loud, and  they'll be cowering under their living room sofa.  I think the best thing  about this album is instead of the usual depressed, self pitying lyrics  common to this type of music, the lyrics are much angrier and lash out  more. This makes it more fun to listen to, for instead of saying how much  they hate themselves, they scream about lashing out at the world and  messing up the other guy. Needless to say, if you need a loud angry album  to calm you down after putting up with a day of school or work, this is  definitely the way to go.<br />Any thoughts on this, e-mail me: Khutta@aol.com
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever saw. Everything is perfect. After watching it, I thought that &quot;is there anything that I didn't like?&quot; and said NO! I like this movie and highly recommend it  to science-fiction and comedy fans and everybody who loves movies of any  kind!
B00000255F|5.0|I've listened to Springsteen for the last 16 years which is half my life.  I first heard him when he released Born in the USA.  I really enjoyed it and went out to see him in concert, the summer of '85 before I started my  senior year in high school, at Meadowlands in NJ with about 70,000 others.  WOW!  At 17 years old this man taught me more about life in those four  hours than high school ever would. Everything I ever needed to know about  love and friendship I learned that night. I ran out the next day and bought  Born to Run and have had it with me ever since.  It is rock at it's moving  best. It's stoires about love and friendship, hopes and dreams, struggles  and triumphs.  Thanks to this album I know what it's like to hope and  dream. I'm happy to say I saw him for the third time on June 17,2000 from  the third row at MSG in NYC. I cried during Thunder Road and was hoarse  during Born to Run.  Buy it, pop it in the CD player, take out the T-Tops  and take a trip down Thunder Road until you get to Jungleland.  You'll  never be the same.
0062502182|4.0|i had &quot;the alchemist&quot; recommended to me by someone who, on a different occasion, also recommended &quot;zen and the art...&quot; i was hesitant to try it because i found &quot;zen&quot; pretentious, wordy,  circular and overly self-indulgent.  i needn't have worried - on the  surface the alchemist is a simple and poetic book, but there are  undercurrents of &quot;universal truths&quot; (for lack of a better word).   at times i had to lower the book, take a breath and let the realisation of  what had been revealed sink in.  none of it was revelatory per se, but  there were constant switches in the accepted way viewing the world that  deserved more contemplation.<br />one of these moments came when the shepherd  relates the &quot;heavy burden&quot; of staying in one place.  where the  accepted view of life is one where the static, predictable, comfortable is  the one to be aspired to, coehlo makes the nomadic, searching shepherd's  life the truly free one.  also, i'm not sure if the translation from  spanish had anything to do with it, but the choice of words is often  inspired.  &quot;the universe CONSPIRES&quot; it could so easily have been  &quot;supports you&quot; or &quot;helps you&quot; or any other self-help  murmurings insertable there, but it wasn't.  it's thievy conspiracy by the  world to make sure you are aware of and are prompted to fulfill your  dreams.<br />occasionally it degenerates into a affirmations checklist -  insert life lesson here, but that happens seldom and because this little  book is so likeable you easily forgive it.<br />it's a parable with meaning  far beyond its simplicity.  even if you miss (and, believe me, it's  difficult to) some of the undertones and allegories, it's a pleasing,  easy-to-read, satisfying story.
B00000JCOV|4.0|I really enjoy listening to this CD. The selections bring forth so much emotion that I practically feel what Slipknot was feeling when they selected them. It is obvious from the singers voice that he loved singing  these songs and that is what makes this CD such a joy to listen to.
B000002LUB|5.0|black sabbath is lightning-fast and when they play, you hear heavy metal thunder
B00004NRWH|4.0|I had the pleasure of seeing these guys live, and before they strap on their guitars, it just seems like this would be another simple rock show. Until they break out with &quot;Breathe&quot; as their opening song.  BOOM!   This guys play a show better than what you think it's gonna be.  You won't  be able to mosh or anything at their shows, but you can have DAMN good time  just listening to them play live.  As for just the album itself, songs such  as &quot;Cowboy Hat&quot; and &quot;Leader of Men&quot; give you that Alice  In Chains/Matchbox 20 feel.  Good, laid back rock album!  And a VERY  powerful vocalist.  Just so you know, the lead singer told me that  &quot;Leader of Men&quot; is about KILLER MUSHROOMS. Well, I'm not into  drugs or anything, but it seems these guys love a good joint every now and  then; but you can't bash 'em for that.  Check out &quot;The State&quot;,  and just sit back and enjoy its melodic presence.
B000002I2I|4.0|This is the only Doors album that my unappreciative fiance will listen to. I know, he's a butthead, but listen; this album is worth having if only for &quot; Blue Sunday&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer&quot;. I'm in no way  saying that the other songs don't rock, but out of all their material,  these are both in my top 5 favorite songs. They're not long, not eloquent  or poetic as some of the others, but very peaceful and romantic. When I  hear Jim sing these, I swoon, and I know that effect is usually not  synonimous with rock music, but it's true. &quot;waiting for the sun&quot;  you will love, and the rest you will grow to love.There's something about  these songs that grows on you. There aren't a lot of recognisable hits, but  don't let that stop you from purchasing it, after all, this is the only  album that my fiance likes!
B00000IPAX|5.0|Ha ha, Obviously the most popular CD out there, that is labeled &quot;punk&quot;.  Why?  Well, let's just say, look at their sales!  Well, the sales are not what counts in a CDs quality, it's the....quality.  But I  bought this CD a couple of months ago from a store.  I thought, since I've  got money to spare, I guess I'd give it a shot.  So I bought it, and I  really thought the only two good songs on there was All The Small Things  and Dumpweed.  I began scanning through tracks, and the first couple of  seconds of each track sounded boring, until I fast foward it, that is.   Every song began making sense to me, and I began enjoying the quality of  the punk trio.  You'll have to agree with me, that these punk rockers' CD  will rule the charts.
B000002HJD|2.0|I am a huge Doors fan, but more so I am  an admirer of Jim Morrison. Over the years I've collected everything I can related to him and the Doors, even this. I won't lie to you. Most people can not appreciate this work. I  say this not because of Jim's incompetence, for which there is none, but  because the majority of people will not want to sit and listen and analyze  and ingest this work out of shear lack of attention span. And, to try and  understand his poetry is not as easy as reading those cute little cards at  the stationery store. This album is for poetry lovers, and non-squeamish  ones at that. I'm sorry to say that I found myself forwarding the tracks to  the next one, and I am certainly not at a loss for understanding.  If you  love Jim, I'd buy it just because it is a piece of him, in which you can  become lost in his soothing voice. Other than that, if you are just  curious, dont' bother.I am ashamed to admit it, but this is the one piece  that I could see myself living without.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Just got through watching the restored Rear Window--it had been so many years since I'd seen it, it was like greeting an old friend... What a wonderful, suspenseful movie by the master...please oh please oh please  release this on DVD!
B000002I2M|5.0|I remember being broke, having only the money for one Doors album. As I searced through all their different albums, I had to choose which one would give me more bang for my buck, pardon the expression. This was the first  one I purchased, and for a reason! I wasn't as familiar then as I am now  with all their material, but this album seemed very promising. It was  indeed a winner.It's just so bluesy and fun, from the first roar of the  motorcycle on L.A woman right to the end  I played this album so much in  high school it earned me the nickname &quot;L.A. woman&quot;, if that can  give one an idea how beloved it is. It offers sounds that people who aren't  into the Doors probably didn't know existed. I absolutely love  &quot;hyacinth house&quot; with it's lyrics 'I need a brand-new friend who  doesn't bother me'. This album will surely not bother you!&quot;L' America  like many of their songs almost sounds like a short story that the listener  almost has to piece together and interpret himself. This was ironically my  first Doors album and their last, as Jim Morrison moved to Paris only to  pass away suddenly. Those who consider themselves fans of the doors will  relish in it, for sentimental reasons, and who knows? Maybe one day  Mr.Mojorisin'will be spotted at Venice Beach singing L.A. woman.
6305657947|4.0|PIERCE BROSNAN &amp; RENEE RUSSO MAKE A HOT &amp; SEXY COUPLE ! IT IS A PLEASURE TO WATCH THEM IN THIS GOOD ROBBERY MOVIE &amp; THE SUSPENS IS INTENSE.<br />GOOD MOVIE !
B000007S5B|4.0|I'm sorry to hear that this album was considered weak by other critics. Honestly, I am very critical of what I hear and I can't help but conclude that this was by no means a failure.Analyze the album all one may, and one  can still not deny that &quot;Spanish Caravan&quot; and &quot;The unknown  soldier&quot; are great pieces of work, I don't care how pressured the  Doors were to produce new material. The great thing about the Doors is that  their songs vary greatly in lyrical content.This was a band that didn't  sing about love 24-7! And if they did they put a spin on it. How many songs  have you heard that have a Native American twinge to them like &quot;my  wild love&quot;, and even here in a song about his love, he speaks of her  and the devil. Yes, it seems sinister but it's not a piece that could've  been put together to take up room on an l.p!  Listen to &quot;Spanish  Caravan&quot; with it's amazing guitar and sound effects of wind, where one  can envision one's self on a ship bound for Portugal or Spain!  Again with  &quot;not to touch the earth&quot; there is almost a deep rooted  primitiveness to the music, like you want to get up and run with him and  dance and carry on when he invites you to, working yourself into a frenzy.  On a completely different note, you will appreciate what seems to be the  harpsicord on &quot;wintertime love&quot;, again,a sweet mellow song that  displays their knack for great music that doesn't have to be typical rock  and roll. With all these distinct sounds on one album ,one can hardly say  that this was 1/2 @ss. Just listen to &quot;yes, the river knows&quot;  where he pleads you to &quot;beieve&quot; him, and you'll see that this  album was wonderful!
B00003CWPR|2.0|WHEN I HEARD ABOUT A KUBRICK MOVIE WITH KIDMAN, CRUISE &amp; POLLACK I WAS EXCITED ! ALL THE GOOD INGREDIENTS WERE THERE TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT MOVIE ; BUT I WAS SO DISSAPOINTED...  THE STORY IS JUST PLAIN &amp; CONFUSING ;  KIDMAN IS VERY GOOD BUT CRUISE GAVE A POUR INTERPRETATION. THE ONLY VERY  THING ARE THE SETS WHICH ARE VERY ARTISTICS...
B000002I2G|5.0|then this album will take you to a place where, from the first blair of regal horns on &quot;tell all the people&quot;, you will be led around through odd places by The Doors. I actually listened to this c.d. while  driving to Las Vegas, Nv, and it got me ready for the ultimate road trip.  With &quot; touch me&quot;, you will not be able to resist Jim imploring  you to let go and embrace his timeless love. The beauty of this song is  that he doesn't do this in a whiny fashion, but commands you and assures  you in a confident way that few have been able to pull off. &quot;wild  child&quot; is another rocking song that in my opinion exhibits The Doors  talent at capturing the attitude of any generation. This song is older than  I am and I feel like the wild child, it transcends itself across time and  is ageless. I think the song that puts it best is &quot;easy ride&quot;, a  very upbeat and get down kind of song that describes the feeling of this  whole album, one big easy fun and strange journey to the soft parade.
B00000IOSU|5.0|When I saw the movie City of Angels and heard the song Angel by Sarah McLachlan, I knew I had to get the c.d. with Angel on it. So I see Mirrorball and said what the hell it's a live c.d. and more importantly,  Angel is on it. But let me tell you something my friends, the whole c.d. is  AWESOME!  I mean, songs such as good enough, hold on, I will remember you  and of course Angel are absolutley beautiful songs. Plus you have the crowd  in the background with Sarah singing. Here's my advice, buy this c.d., get  your headphones, relaxe, and just listen and enjoy.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I have always been a great fan of A-ha, but with their new release, they have made me into a worshiper. In India and Pakistan, it is believed that gods speak through the throats of certain singers/artists. I believe that  West can see such materalization through the vocal strings of Morten  Harket. LONG LIVE A-HA. May the entire world (especially U.S.A) recognize  the grace and magnitude of your new effort. ME/MS is the album that will  last in your memories with its haunting melodies and irresistable rhythum.
B00004TL21|5.0|Yes,  This is the new and improved Deftones.  They were able to get great advise and mix thenew style with bands like pantera.  I highly recomend this cd to anyone who loves Rock.

B00003CWLE|5.0|This is a true outstanding epic movie. I'm really surprised why it wasn't hailed as greatly as it should have been. I personally hail it as one of the greatest movies of all time, a true classic in every sense. I've seen  it totally ignorant of all the versions that preceded it and I've loved it  with the very first few lines \\"She came unaware of all the suspicion that  preceded her\\" \\" the first English woman I have seen\\". This story of two  unconventional people in conventional times with all its historical facts  and lush gorgeous background is capable of sweeping one's off his feet  making him feel all that cultural and emotional struggle that Anna and the  King seem to go through. Jodie Foster was lovely and extraordinary although  I used to think that she is too modern-looking for such movies...I guess I  was gravely mistaken. I think the movie's real surprise is Chow Yun-Fat who  was truly amazing. He seems to be so much at home with all this kingly  charm. He has such grace and overwhelming presence that would make him  probably one of the most remembered kings on the screen. I can't help  wondering if the original king was as charming as he was....and wouldn't be  nice if all kings were like that? We would surly love them. And what of the  palace? Do I dare and say more? I was totally amazed to know that they've  built a replica of the original one...wow!  I envy Jodie and Chow for being  in such lofty surroundings.  I think I would write a book if I were to  describe everything I loved in this movie...but I must take my hat off to  Andy Tennant for making such a masterpiece and for all the designers. Of  course, I must not forget the movie's music and photography and the  beautiful script that seems to linger in the mind forever for I would  always remember that \\"when a woman has so much to say and doesn't say it.  Her silence can be deafening.\\".
B000031XCR|5.0|I used to hate vocals. But for some reason, I became a Celine Dion fan and no longer hate vocals. In my opinion,Celine Dion has the best voice of any female singer. I hope that Celine will someday sing a duet with Jack  Jones(my favorite male singer) that would be a sound to hear.
B0000214F3|5.0|The movie, in my opinion, is a masterpiece in every aspect and every small detail. The leading actors are perfectly fit for their roles. And isn't it enough to know that the movie must be superb since we have Anthony Hopkins  and Brad Pitt as the leading actors? Hopkins as Bill Parrish is as  terrific, majestic and overwhelming as he is always. Brad Pitt as Joe Black  portrays death in a charming mixture of child-like innocence and an  overwhelming power that a critic has said: \\" If death were as charming as  that, most of us would go to it willingly\\".  The script is just so  exquisite and so intelligent that you will find yourself captured at times  in witty conversations or charmed by poetic speeches made by Parrish. In  fact, I've spent days with Hopkins' words and charming deep voice ringing  in my ears as he tells his daughter \\"I want you to sing with rapture and  dance like a dervish\\". Well, I think that they should have listed the  script as one of the leading figures in the movie. The movie is also  perfect with its grand exquisite settings. Parrish's mansion and pool are  just breathtaking. Although a lot of people criticized the movie for its  length but the hours you spend in watching it are by no means wasted. I  believe that Meet Joe Black is a must-watch for those who like to see the  art of making movies in its charming deep meaning. \\"It's a real up lifter  \\".
0061007137|5.0|I am not really a fan of books but when I started reading this book (my first Archer book), I could not put it down. The action is relentless, plot deep and more importantly, the writing is brilliant. Adam Scott is a  character that is a hero by chance and you will find yourself rooting for  him even when he finds himself in a spot. All in all, a great book. I hope  a movie is in the works.
B00004TL21|5.0|The 3rd largely produced album from the Deftones is definatly the Deftones, but a new Deftones.  Could I have fit the band name in that last sentence any more?   I am actually listening to it right now.  This is a  more melodic album, it has less hard pounding and screaming as the last  two.  The guitars sound the same and the vocals are the same, but there is  something just more mellow and organized about it.  For those of you who  like bands of this genre, but sometimes get turned off by consistant  screaming every now and then, this is a must for your collection.  Their  previous albums, I would enjoy to a point and then had to take a breather;   White Pony can keep playing and playing!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears is a great singer she has a great voice. She is one of my favorite singers I love her songs there isn't a song by her that I don't like I like all of them but my favorite song by her is oops I did it  again.<br />(britney Spaers is hot)
B00004TL21|5.0|Thank God for Deftones. During a period in music while every tired, two-bit, wanna-be Limp Bizkit/Korn band is populating the record racks, along comes Deftones with a refreshingly original and legit album. It's  amazing how this band has evolved over their last two albums. They could  have easily come out with the same thing over and over but they took a  chance and delivered a CD with more melodic and dynamic tunes. Every song  is unique in it's sound and texture, which is almost unheard of these days.  The standout songs are (not to discount the others): RX Queen, Teenager,  Change, Passenger (with Maynard), and Pink Maggit (although I enjoyed the  demo version better but it's still good). I recommend getting the Limited  Edition version so that you can get the good bonus track, The Boys  Republic, also.

B00000J6AG|5.0|This cd just gets you.  I could listen to this cd so much it is crazy.  My test of a good cd is if I could sit in a car, go on a road trip, and listen to it all the way through, without getting sick of it.  This passes the  test.  I cant say a bad song on here.  My personal faves are Honey,  Porcelain, Bodyrock, and Natural Blues.  Just buy this cd and listen to it,  cause you get the best price here anyway.
0140187537|3.0|Put me in mind of places and situations I've seen.  Seemed to drag on though.  Hard read with all the line chasing and pet names.
630526323X|4.0|This is a very dark version of Dracula and visually stunning. Similar to the 1922 silent version, Klaus Kinski plays the count as a horrible, creepy, creature from hell, and the sound of his breathing is unnerving. It  also has an eerie score. Bruno Ganz and Isabelle Adjani play Jonathan  Harker and his wife with rather remote blandness, and the rest of the cast  is bizarre...the rats however, do a splendid job !  I find all the Dracula  movies fascinating, it's a tale that will never grow old...see this film  for the brilliant cinematography, but for a version acted with heart and  soul, see Coppola's &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot;.
B00003CWL6|5.0|All I have to say is that the preview for this movie did it no justice.  American Beauty was incredible, but when I first saw the previews, it looked boring.  This has occured in movies such as Meet Joe Black, The  Devil's Advocate, The Matrix, and especially Fight Club.  Movies like  Battlefield Earth and Star Wars have been hyped up with their sci-fi  previews, but only disappoint with bad plots.  My Formula For A Good Movie  is to make a bad preview, and you will get a good movie.  When the audience  is not expecting much and you surprise them, it will leave an impact.  Anyway, American Beauty is great.  It is such a tease to not release it  until October!
0767802659|4.0|This seems to be a minority view, in that only about one in five reviews I've read see it this way, but I'm convinced that this film is one of the greatest cinematic jokes ever.  It seems to me that the film is a very,  very clever comment on propaganda film.  I think the idea behind it is that  it is exactly the sort of film that a patriotic director in Heinlen's  fascistic Starship Troopers society would produce to motivate people to get  behind the war effort.  Therefore, you have the attractive stars, the  heroic action and most importantly, the dehumanization of the enemy.  The  fact that the enemy are bugs is the device he uses to get a late 20th  century audience to fall for the trick, but when you take a step back, what  the film actually tells you as fact about the bugs is only that they were  attacked first by humans and fought back: there is no other reason to think  the bugs evil or deserving of slaughter other than the viewer's (cleverly  manipulated) anti-bug prejudice.  Substitute for &quot;bugs&quot; Jews,  Germans, Communists, etc, etc. . . Get it?<br />I suspect Verhoven would  regard the fact that most reviewers see the film only as a moderately  successful (if slightly over-the-top) action movie as confirmation of his  point about the power of well-crafted propaganda.
0670880728|5.0|This was one of the funniest books I have ever read!  You will laugh at the smug marrieds and fall on the floor as Bridget tries to navigate through dieting, booze binges and dating. Then when the meets Mr. D'arcy,  all hell breaks loose! Bridget is my favorite Singleton and I am hopeful  the makers of the movie do her justice. She is the poster girl for all of  the Singleton's out there who deal with Job, Crazy Family and the  absolutely heinous world of &quot;Comparison shop-dating!&quot; You go  Bridget! <br />And as a casting note for the British Film company filming this  movie, if you don't get Colin Firth to play Mr. D'arcy you should be drawn  and quartered!
B00004SCS1|5.0|This band is awesome.  Every song on this album rocks.  especially suggestions and p.l.u.c.k. I really hope i get to see this band live becus i have heard they put on an amazing show (also having nice outfits and  weacky things done to their face.
0425129586|5.0|As I sat down to read this book the afternoon I received it in the mail, many questions passed through my mind. I had never read any of Agatha Christie's mystery novels, and I wondered, would I like this one? Looking  down at the first page somehow I knew that I would.<br />The first chapter  sets the stage for the wonderful story to come, and every puzzle piece is  set there for the finale.<br />The book is brilliantly written, and masterly  crafted by Agatha Christie. Now, do not sit down exspecting to solve this  one, because that feat seems entirely impossible. I don't believe she gives  enough clues for that to be done, however I guess there might be someone  who figured it out.<br />This novel was so good I could literally not put it  down. I finished it in about 4 hours, and was very pleased at the end of  the day.<br />I highly recommend this book, even if you are not a fan of the  mystery genre, because the book itself is a literary classic.<br />I am  pleased I decided to read this book because now I know I like Agatha  Christie and will read more of her books, and I hope you do too.
0517053616|2.0|There are, obviously, pros and cons to buying any book. This edition of the complete works of Shakespeare is no different. Of course, Shakespeare is great no matter what the binding of the book looks like, but I would  really hesitate to purchase a single book containing the complete works, if  you're buying for everyday reading. I find that such large volumes are  awkward, hard to hold and really thick. My personal collection of  Shakespeare's works consists of single-work paperback volumes, not lovely  to look at, but functional. Someday I hope to buy a set of the complete  works in hardcover, but when I do, I'll look for a set, not a single book.  However, if you're looking for the complete works in a compact package,  this book is for you.
B00000I950|4.0|&quot;Voulez Vous,&quot; recorded in 1979 has long been deemed ABBA's disco album or their &quot;flirtation&quot;  with disco.  In some ways, throughout all the tracks, there is some disco influence, yet in songs such  as &quot;Chiquitita,&quot;  ABBA still manages to demonstrate their knack  for beautifully flowing songs.  And, truthfully, what's so bad about them  flirting with disco?  Other artists such as Dolly Parton(!) did it at the  time (Dolly's &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;  and &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;   were certified Gold), so it really just means that the album is rather  trendy.  This is just one time where ABBA really sort of &quot;gave  in&quot;  to mainstream disco, and slightly shied away from the  irresistable pop formula of their earlier and later records.  However, this  is still a wonderful album, as are all ABBA albums I've ever heard.  Every  track stands out in my mind, and even for all its saccharine sweetness,  &quot;I Have A Dream&quot;  can be considered sweet and uplifting.  If  you're a disco fan or just an ABBA fan, give this album a  try.<br />Highlights: &quot;As Good As New&quot;  (Agnetha's voice soars  beautifully here) &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; &quot;Angeleyes&quot; &quot;If It  Wasn't for the Nights &quot;Chiquitita&quot; &quot;Lovers(Live A Little  Longer)&quot;

B00004TL21|4.0|but no less moving, White Pony definately is a mus for the heavy metal fans out there. Change (in the house of flies) is a moving piece, with the vocal screaming for attention over the subtle but still heavy riff. Another  great example would be Feiticeira. Heavy heavy ballads could be the theme  for this record, but a great move for the guys in the Deftones. They  deviated a bit from their path, but I believe that it's a great record and  it will help them rather than hinder. Who wants to hear the same stuff  anyways? Hats off to them!
1558908358|5.0|This film came out in the summer of 82. This was a good summer for films(E.T., Star Trek II, Rocky III, Poltergeist). I recently checked the digitally remastered vhs out and hope to find this one on dvd soon. Nothing  but fun! The soundtrack by Wendy Carlos kicks(good tune by Journey-ONLY  SOLUTIONS also).It is fun to see how dated the computer hardware technology  is in the film when the actors are busy typing on those old TRS models! (ha  ha).      David Warner makes a truly evil villian as does the voice of MCP.  Cute Cindy Morgan is always fun to watch(have always wondered what has  become of her since her Caddyshack days!).Jeff Bridges swaggers around the  screen much like Han  Solo. Light cycle chase is awesome(remember the video  game tie in to this film! ).Awesome light show!
B000003TA4|3.0|Nevermind.<br />This album is awesome. Nirvana expresses the ideas of the members and can combine the ideas with good music. The song &quot;come as you are&quot; is one of the best songs of this album. This album represents  the maturity of Nirvana with their music. A bad aspect  of this album is  that the majority of the songs have the same format, but all are good for  the ideas and the combined rhythm.
6303965415|5.0|This is a fine movie adaptation of a beautiful story about a gracious, intelligent woman falling in love again with a former fiance.  This Jane Austen story is very sweet and moving and the heroine is particularly  worthy.  Amanda Root did a wonderful job playing this role.  Ciaran Hinds  did very nicely as the suitor, but his character doesn't shine quite as  well as in the book.  Overall, a pleasant and touching film.<br />Some of the  negative reviewers below compare this film with Emma and Sense and  Sensibility and if you are looking for high-gloss, Hollywood Austen, then  you might agree with their opinions.  But this is not a high-budget movie,  and as enjoyable as those movies are, this one gives another perspective  into Jane Austen's world which is probably more faithful.  To true fans of  Austen, this film will hold its own.
B00003CXFU|5.0|I want to thank Julia Roberts for making this film and for portraying Erin  Brockovich with such strength.  This film may not have been the best legal  drama but that wasn't it's intent.  The intent was to show a woman who  started with no money, three kids, no job and ended up making a lot of  money because she CARED about other people.  <br />It shows a strong woman who  had to do things on her own and survived.  It shows a caring mom who  dressed scantily and made it look good.  How many women out there went out  and bought Wonder Bras after that film?  It shows a woman who was dedicated  so much to helping other people that she spent her own time and money to do  it.<br />And the part is played so genuinely.  When she looks at her soon to  be boyfriend and says, &quot;Are you going to be something else I have to  survive because if you are, I have to tell you, I just don't know if I'm up  for that right now,&quot; every woman knows how she feels.<br />I am  incredibly impressed with this movie and the job Julia Roberts did as Erin  Brockovich.  I saw the movie with my boyfriend and he looked at me after it  and said - you're just like her.  And I took it as an amazing compliment.
B00004THAY|5.0|Imagine two guitar legends hooking up on an album. Imagine those two being blues artists and what you have is a fantastic album. Eric and B.B. compliment each other so well that your stereo might melt from the music  that comes out of it. The ferocity that B.B. gives each recording is what  you expect. Eric gives it a more subtle sound. Both play terrific solos and  the vocals are very passionate. My favorite track is &quot;Key To The  Highway&quot; simply because it is acoustic and that is my favorite style  of blues. This CD is what everyone who likes blues would expect from these  two. Absolutely fantastic!
B000000OU0|5.0|It does not matter if your a casual Eagles fan, or a die hard Eagles fan, this is the 70's supper groups best ever recording.  It features all of the bands greatest hits in striped down aucustic beauty.  The live performance  is just fantastic. The best versions of Hotel California, Desperado, and  Teqila Sunrise are all here,  yes even better than the 70's origional  recordings!   Check this one out if you dont already have it.
B000000QFV|4.0|Well, this is the sort of Sabbath album you would never expect: a concept album.  The weird thing about this concept album is that it dwells into Norse mythology.  I always thought Tony Martin dealt more with myth and  lore in his lyrics much like Ronnie James Dio.  It's actually surprisingly  good music, but you have to listen to it many times for it to finally sink  in.  &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; is a good track, as are the three that flow  into each other:  &quot;The Battle of TYR,&quot; &quot;Odin's Court,&quot;  and &quot;Valhalla.&quot;  The best track on here has to be the  &quot;Sabbath Stones&quot; and I absolutely dug the last minute of this  song!
6304494661|2.0|It was Mentioned that She left him for a football player right after the fight. Ahhh doesn't make sense, but niether does part 3.<br />I think this is a ok sequel it ain't bad, but it ain't good either.<br />The storyline is  pretty bad, but we get alot of good Cinema Moments that help this  film.<br />still.... bad Sequel.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When pure cinematic bliss like Fight Club is deprived of even a NOMINATION for best picture, It makes me ill.  I very rarely care what others think of movies in contrast to my opinions, but this movie really deserves the  highest commendations by the public, not complaints about violence.  Never  have I seen such masterfull satire on the modern consumer, intertwined with  subplots and twists that both amaze and boggle the mind at the same time.   I try to respect other people's opinions of movies, but there really is no  good reason to hate this film.  All you need is a stomach for mild violence  (If you disagree about this film's violence being mild, check out Saving  Private Ryan's opening sequence) and a sense of humor. You will love this  movie.  Period.
B00000490M|3.0|This is a Decent film that I enjoy very much.<br />Too bad for the sequels, they could have done so much more for this movie.<br />You can avoid the Sequels, but see this film.
B00000J631|5.0|This is one of the best cds I own.if you havent heard of some of these bands, this is the place to hear them.Now, normallly, I hate bad religion and pennywise, but these are some of the best songs ive ever heard.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson star in this hilarious, clever, well acted comedy about the day in the life of two convenience-store clerks.  During the day the two play a hockey game, a funeral parlor, discuss how  independent Contractors died in the second death star, and deal with every  messed up customer you can think of.  This one is a winner.
B00004U9WR|5.0|When I watched Toy Story I, I was incredibly amazed at not only the storyline but also the computer graphics.  When Toy Story II was released, I never thought that the movie could be as good as the first one.  We all  know how sequels normally go in the movie market.  But, with the addition  of several characters, the return of most of the original cast, and another  great script, this movie broke my expectations apart and I left the theater  being just as amazed if not even more than the first one.  I will  definitely have the toy box collection in my posession when it is released!
B00004U9WR|5.0|Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2 on DVD together,  this is a must have set for anyones DVD collection.  Young or old.  Great movies.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I was watchin'some music videos and I saw people in masks come out and started playing &quot;Wait And Bleed&quot; I really liked the song! I bought the album at the store when it was on sale. The next song I liked  was &quot;Spit It Out&quot; This album is perfect for the Metal Fan! Get It  Now!
B0000024SN|5.0|Though many people (including the artists, I believe) decry the overdubbing of electric instruments on this LP (especially the title track), I think it makes this one of S&amp;G's most listenable albums.<br />The title track, previously issued as an acoustic folk number on their debut album, gains tremendsouly from the dubbing, both artistically and commercially. Note that the original acoustic version disappeared with nary a trace, while the electrified reworking topped the pop charts and launced S&amp;Gs careers. The electric overdubbing adds a sting to the bitterness not achieved by the acoustic rendition.<br />Though Simon may have refined his talent on subsequent albums, his every-man poetics were well in place on songs like &quot;Blessed,&quot; &quot;April Come She Will,&quot; and a rewrite of Edward Robinson's &quot;Richard Cory.&quot; The angry young man of &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; can also be heard on the closing number, &quot;I Am a Rock.&quot; Perhaps the only real misstep is the poorly aging &quot;We've Got a Groovy Thing Goin'.&quot;<br />Simon's melodies are as haunting as his lyrics, and the duo's harmonies blended sweet and bitter, linking backward to the folk tradition and forward to the rage of the times.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This CD really proves that Britney has matured since her debut album.  There is a lot of attitude and sass in this album that was missing from a lot of the songs in the first album.  Britney has an amazing voice which  really makes the album hers.  I love this CD but if you listen to it  repeatdly over and over again, it can start to get annoying.  Save the  pleasure of listening to the album once or twice a day at maximum.
B00000I01A|5.0|Though I don't own a cd soundtrack after watching the film I couldn't help watching it over and over again until now.  Not only the movie itself was great but the music as well which what made me crazy about it. Especially  the songs Hearts on Fire and There's no easy way out and not to forget the  war theme too.

079215228X|5.0|A truly romantic movie.  I have probably watched this movie 50 times and I never get bored with it.  Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze and Whoopi give an excellent performance.  The script was beautifully written and the music  was perfect.  I absolutely love Whoopi's attitude toward Patrick Swayze.   If you haven't seen this movie, you really need to get to your nearest  video store and rent it.  I've been wondering why this hasn't been released  on DVD yet....I would love to add it to my collection....hint hint. :)
B0000020C4|3.0|This is a good recording of a great musical, but with serious flaws. First, there is Colm Wilkinson. He was the first - and for many people only - Valjean, but he was getting on in years by the time they made this  recording. The acting is still there, but the voice isn't. Wilkinson is  much better on the Original London and Broadway Cast redordings.<br />Michael  Maguire as Enjolras is also much better on the Broadway Cast Recording.  Here his high notes sound strained. But he and Wlikinson do decent jobs,  and Michael Ball as Marius and Philip Quast as Javert are excellent as  usual. The performer who ruins this recording is Ruthie Henshall as  Fantine. Most Fantine's tend to whine and sob a little for dramatic affect,  but Henshall is downright annoying. The first third of the musical suffers  seriously as a result.<br />If you're going to get this version, get it in  it's video form. As a recording, it doesn't measure up against the best.  Try the Original London Cast or the Complete Symphonic Recording.
B00004TL21|5.0|I have been in to the deftones since october of 95.This was when there first album adrenaline came out.The tones have always done things a little different than every body else.This album goes along with that same way of  thinking.now that metal seems to be cool to listen to again,the tones offer  up a new flavor and go against the grain.I have to admit i did not like the  album the first time a listened to it.for some reason like every great c.d  ,this one grows on you and you can't seem to shake it.Any fan of the last 2  records dont expect some hard and heavy riffs, just some very emotional  music that is heavy in another way.So listen with a open mind and realize  heavy can come in a different way.so i recommend this album to everyone who  loves great music and has a open mind.feel free to email me deftones fans
0060234814|5.0|The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe has earned a spot on my top ten list of my all time favorite books. This is without a doubt one of the greatest books ever written.  In this book we are introduced to Peter, Susan, Edmund  and Lucy. They find a magic wardrobe that takes them to the land of Narnia  where wonderful adventures await them.<br />Memorable characters abound in  this book: Aslan-the great lion, Jadis-the white witch, Tumnus-the faun,  Mr. and Mrs. Beaver ... just to name a few.<br />This is fun reading. Buy  this book.
B00003W8NM|3.0|Fight Club is such a literate, well-acted, visually impressive movie that you could easily miss the fact that it doesn't have a singe interesting thought in its head. It's central thesis is that men are being emasculated  by our consumer culture, losing touch with their nature -- which manifests  itself here and in Chuck Palahniuk's book through the desire to beat other  men senseless just for the heck of it.<br />You wouldn't think this idea was  big enough to support a 20-page short story (it isn't) and so it's not  surprising that the film seems heavily padded with scenes that do nothing  to develop character or move the plot forward, but give Brad Pitt and Ed  Norton plenty of opportunity to flex their pecs.<br />Still, Norton's as good  as ever -- he can take mediocre material and make it seem special -- and  Pitt is at his near-best, as he was in David Fincher's Seven. Watch for  Meat Loaf, by the way, in a surprising role.<br />The movie is visually  stylish, and the fight scenes pack a punch, but ultimately the whole thing  is emptier than Fincher's previous work: Seven and the underrated Alien3.
0767836251|4.0|This film is beautifly put together. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a great role as the ever so perfect Kathryn who's brother Sebastion is a sly ladies man. Reese Witherspoon acts wonderfully also. Sorry if I didnt go to deep  into the movie in this certain review.
0767903854|3.0|I guess expat Aussies everywhere are pleased to find new travel books about their homeland, with the hope they can sneak to a quiet corner inside the book and joyfully roll in the often incredulous (and favorable) remarks  - just like a queensland blue-heeler dog in 'roo dung.  I know I do !<br />And I had a good roll in &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot;.  The author  is accurate and fair (perhaps a bit starry-eyed) and I enjoyed the  travelogue and the anecdotes.<br />But the book is disjointed.  It chops and  changes, and the reader has to either cover vast distances in a paragraph  or tediously explore some private fascination for half a chapter. The  editing could have been tighter.<br />This 'wide brown land' is too big for  one book by one author. Nevertheless, Bill Bryson's book is a good read.  The average 'Pom' will get further insight as to why the convicts stayed in  Australia when their terms expired.  And 'Yanks' will see that if they want  to experience the 60's and 70's (of their parent's memories), then they  should 'go bush' in Australia.<br />Buy the book.  Go there.  And take spare  urine (read the book and you'll understand).
B000002HMH|5.0|I was a huge fan of Metallica's heavy metal Master of Puppets style music, and I still am. Having said that, Load is by far their finest work to date. It is the work of a band who are at their peak, who have already won all  the acclaim they need and are just doing things their way, and I love it. I  have over 100 CDs ranging through Indie, Punk, Metal, Dance, Grunge and  ballad-ish stuff, and this is the best of them all. The moral here is, if  you're a Metallica fan, buy this CD, if you're not into Metallica, buy  this. In addition, see them live, there;s just nothing like it.
B00004T9UF|1.0|Eminem is a good mc, but to do the same thing with this album that he did with the first is sad.  You've gotta come with something better and original than to repeat yourself.  He's played, shock-jock mc'ing is good  for one or two songs,not albums.  To be a good rapper and waste it on that  album, which by the way drags a lot, is stupid.  The sophomore jinx has  busted eminem in the face.  ...  BOOOOOOOO! gets for such wimpy  rebelliousness sells albums; it's like shooting fish in a barrel, boy, and  it amounts to one thing: SELLOUT.n my opinion  the best song on the album is &quot;The Way I Am&quot; which is  written,produced,and mixed by Eminem.It's one of the less disturbing songs  and it's got a phat beat and well written lyrics. My only complaint is I  would have liked to see him do more producing since he shows in that song  he has the talent to do so.<br />People need to forget the overpublicized  lyrical content and recognize that he has the right to be a cocky rapper.  Some say somphmore albums got a curse on them but he proves that the whole  sophmore slump thing only applies to people without alot of talent. <br />THIS  ALBUM IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN HIS ORIGNAL(that doesn't even seem possible,I  know) BUY IT IT'S WORTH EVERY CENT.BUM IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN HIS ORIGNAL(that doesn't even seem possible,I  know) BUY IT IT'S WORTH EVERY CENT.
0440217563|5.0|It took some doing for my aunt to get me to pick up this series, but I am so thankful I did! I usually don't read romance novels, and since I thought this was one, I didn't want anything to do with it!  I have seldom been so  wrong! Gabaldon is able to craft a rich tapestry of charachters that you  really care about, while keeping historical detail accurate and the plot  moving.  This series(especially Voyager)has something for everyone.  I know  men who enjoy theese books! For anyone who has doubts, bite the bullet and  give it a try.  You will be hooked!
078322804X|4.0|This is a great movie. I was a little kid when I saw it the first time and I've seen it many a time after but it always puts me in a good mood. The story of redemption by two low class but good intentioned criminals has  classic moments with great cameos by rythym and blues greats. The musical  numbers are awesome and the dvd is full of extras which the real blues  brothers fan can't do without. Also, it has been digitally remastered for  home theatre and thank you, because it just wouldn't be the same if it  wasn't. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the price is a  little steep for a twenty one year old movie. All in all though, you get  your money's worth
B000002HRE|4.0|Their album, Reload, is amazing.  The sound and passion of the album allows any listener to see how a timeless hard rocking band, has grown.  I recomend this ablum to anyone, not just heavy metal fans. Unforgiven 2 is  an amazing song that is as rockin as it is weiredly cool.
0784010188|5.0|This is the rare type of movie that can be looked at two ways. If you saw the first movie, it's a good continuation of the story with eye popping special effects. If this your first expierence with the movie, you still  will catch on the gist of the story with the special effects. Either way  it's a good story of human nature and the fear of machines too smart for  humans own good. The special effects were trailblazers for movies such as  the matrix and even jurrasic park. Just about every action movie fan will  like this. Some may not though because it basically is a violent movie with  good intentions. Overall, a must for the man with a dvd player.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido and her debut CD &quot;No Angel&quot; is truly serendipity in a jewel case for anybody who purchases this album. I watched Roswell a few times and I thought the theme song, &quot;Here with Me,&quot; was the best part  of the show. I purchased the album based on that beautiful song alone. Once  I listened got it and listened to it the first time, I couldn't stop  listening to it. I dare everyone to buy this CD and you will not regret it.  The least you can do is sample them on Amazon. Dido does not get the  recognition she deserves nor the airplay on radio. I have finally begun  heard &quot;Here With Me&quot; and &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot; on the  radio on a regular basis. Her amazing voice coupled with emotional and  powerful lyrics makes No Angel one of the classic CD's that won't come out  of my CD changer.
B000002AV5|5.0|Not a week goes by when I don't play this CD.  I have had it for three years and it is nearly worn out.  I just love her stuff and eagerly await her new album that has been promised for at least two years. Love the sexy  Caribbean/Latin/African beats. This is an all-time classic.
B000000WF0|5.0|Opinion on this album generally ranges from 'brilliant' to 'masterpiece', with good reason. This is in all aspects a classic album, and one of the defining moments of 1990's music. Rock music had been going slow up until  this release in 1997. Alongside Radiohead's OK Computer, Urban Hymns gave  90's rock some credibility after some tumultuous times in the hands of the  Gallaghers and their eyebrows. <br />The music on this disc is sonically  intricate. But behind all the shifting shapes and colours that mark these  songs are faultlessly crafted pop/rock songs that are both memorable and  scintillating. 'Sonnet' is a timeless gem. 'The Drugs Don't Work'- a UK  number one, is the most haunting song on the album, yet still manages to  leave you feeling euphoric and flushed with adrenalin thanks largely to the  sweeping strings and great lyrics...<br />'Like a cat in a bag/Waiting to  drown/This time I'm coming down.'<br />It's undeniable that these are Richard  Ashcroft's songs but they would be lost without the guitar work of Nic  McCabe, who leaves drug-fuelled lashes all over these Urban Hymns. <br />All  in all, one of the best rock albums of recent memory, and it should be in  your record collection today.
6305311463|4.0|This is not a movie you watch for the plot twists, or for the amazing screenplay, etc.  Unlike many super-action blockbusters, Armageddon actually succeeds at entertaining and producing a very enjoyable movie.   <br />The acting is great - the characters are great, and it is a literal  roller-coaster ride to save the world.  Is it far fetched?  Yes.  Is it  hollywood?  Yes.  But despite my synicism and hatred of Hollywood garbage,  I really enjoyed the movie - and am considering adding it to my DVD  collection.<br />The FX were awesome and it did do a good job of showing how  people will give their lives to do something for the good of all people.   Extremely entertaining! <br />Some of the awesome lines from the movie that  had me laughing out loud...<br />&quot;What are you doing with a gun in  space.&quot; &quot;Get off...the...nuclear...warhead.&quot;<br />Billy Bob  Thorton, Ben Afflek, Steve Buscimi deliver great acting...this movie is a  blockbuster that succeeds - you do not come out of the movie feeling  cheated or that it was dumbed down for you...rather, you come out feeling  like someone took you to the moon and back and bombarded you with an  awesome hollywood experience!
B000002HHB|2.0|This CD is simply boring, with none of the lively pop found on the earlier 10,000 Maniacs CDs. Natalie needs to liven it up a bit and not be quite so self-indulgent.<br />Speaking of self-indulgence, a few of these reviews say  that Natalie was friends with River Phoenix, which is why she wrote and  recorded &quot;River.&quot;  This is not true--I saw an interview with  Natalie where she said she didn't even know him.  I think she was just  jumping on the bandwagon with this one.
0553275976|5.0|Reading \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" is the best thing happened to me this year. The novel is one of the best I've read in my life. The author has expertly developed a chain of ordinary events into a gripping tale. Very  strong character development, elaborate details and unbiased analysis of  the contradictions existing in metropolitan life in USA are the hallmarks  of this work. Shame that Tom Wolfe has written only two novels.
6305127689|1.0|The widescreen version of this movie, is actually just the full screen version with the top and bottom replaced with black bars.  This means even more is cropped from the movie, and you actually see even LESS than the  full screen.  This is fraudulent, and the video and sound quality are  mediocre.  It's a real shoddy job for such a good movie.
0792839129|5.0|I can't begin to tell you how many times my 2.5 year old son has asked to watch this video. He loves the car and the kids and the songs. It's a long movie, so we tend to watch it in batches.<br />We even bought the soundtrack  for the car!
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby creates a sensual audio masterpiece with this album. The tracks herein are both groov-alicious (&quot;Honey&quot;) to thoroughly meditative (&quot;Guitar, Flute, and String&quot;), so there's a little bit of  everything for anytime.  With Play Moby proves that you can use synth and  turntables to express desire, sorrow, and hope.<br />This album is constantly  being listed in the top 20 or 25 albums of the 1990s; there's a good reason  for this, and it came out at the very end of the decade.  I see it as a  nice musical closure to the 90s, so don't miss it!
B000002WYT|5.0|I'm a relatively new Dave Matthews Fan, and after hearing and buying Under The Table and Dreaming I decided that I must buy their next album, Crash.  This album begins exactly where Under The Table left off, the music is  semi-diverse and played masterfully.  I can say that I thoroughly enjoy his  album, and that if you have any other DMB albums and enjoy them you should  purchase this one too.
0783229321|5.0|The video transfer is extremely good.  It is a very clean print; no pops or other defects.<br />The sound is Right and Left Stereo with Subwoofer. While this is not Dobly 5.1, it does an adequate job.<br />If you are a fan of  Animal House I would recommend this DVD
6302579295|5.0|Artist David Hockney's set design adds a wonderful dimension to this production (which premiered in San Francisco with a mostly different cast).  Given that &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; is a fairy tale, I found the  imaginative and whimsical sets very pleasing.  The cast is wonderful too.  Kathleen Battle's Pamina is beautiful to behold and wonderful to listen to  -- her voice is sweet, never shrill.  Manfred Hemm as Papageno is just cute  enough, nicely engaging and the perfect comic actor for this role.  The  stately Kurt Moll as Sarastro the high priest sings with the voice of God  himself (as well he should in the aria 'Im diesen heilgen Hallen').  Luciana Serra simply IS the Queen of the Night.  If I don't mention the  others, it's for lack of space.  James Levine's orchestra is topnotch  (well, this is the Met, so what else would it be?).  Subtitles make the  &quot;singspiel&quot; libretto accessible to us English speakers.  If you  want a definitive version of &quot;The Magic Flute,&quot; take my advice  and buy this one!

However, if you're looking for the original  brilliance of Lucas...sorry. If you're looking for  solid character  development...no cigar.

B00000055E|4.0|overall...this is a good album.  it shows all kinds of sides to tupac.  however, some of the tracks on this album are mind boggling.  for instance, what is &quot;Redemption&quot;(song 1, disc 1) about?  i have yet to come  to any conclusion of the &quot;secret message&quot; to this song.  if  anyone knows, e-mail me and tell me what &quot;Redemption&quot; is supposed  to mean.  peace.
0385484518|5.0|I'm not one for sappy, emotional, tear jerker books, but this is one of the greatest books that I have read.  I very much disagree with other reviews I have read saying that nothing happens, or Mr. Albom did a poor  job writing the book.<br />I feel Mr. Albom did a terrific job writing a  simple book on a complicated topic.  To me the book is exactly what I  expected it to be.  It was a journal of the last days between not only a  student and a teacher, but two wonderful friends.  However, I felt the book  also did a great job of addressing the bond felt between the two as well as  share some of Morrie's wisdom with the rest of the world.
B000002P6R|3.0|After listening to this album, the first of the band's two 80's efforts, I sometimes wonder whether or not Pete Townshend writes the lyrics before the  music, as he seems to put more thought into the lyrics than the melodies  and song structures, which seem rather bland. However, after a few listens,  this album does grow on you.  There are some good songs here, such as,  &quot;Don't Let Go the Coat&quot;, &quot;Did You Steal My Money&quot;,  &quot;How Can You Do It Alone&quot;, &quot;Another Tricky Day&quot;, and  the bonus songs, &quot;It's In You&quot; and &quot;Somebody Saved Me&quot;  are also pretty good. Criticizing this and their last album, (&quot;It's  Hard&quot;) as being worthless efforts because of the absence of Keith Moon  is ridiculous. The Who still had a lot of life left in them.(By the way,  Kenney Jones isn't as &quot;wild&quot; as Mooney was, but he's still an  excellent drummer). While not quite up to par with Who classics like  &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Who's Next&quot;, it's still a worthwhile  album, although I feel that &quot;It's Hard&quot; is the better of their  two 80's albums. I actually feel that &quot;Who Are You&quot; (which  featured Mooney by the way) was their worst album. I'd give Face Dances  three and a half stars if I could.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|Fight Club is a movie I didn't expect to be totally awesome, but I was wrong, again. The film shows true potential and is one of a kind. The acting is awesome, the direction is marvellous, the screenplay is ingenius  and the editing is pefection. This film is a big hit with the critics and  one of the few films that deserves all the praise it gets.<br />Edward Norton  deserves praise for his role as a young man who is continously attending  'groups' at different countries. When he meets a soap maker on his plane  called Tyler Durdon (the marvellous Brad Pitt) they start up a fight club,  which is successful, but turns dangerous and dirty.<br />Fight Club is so  awesome and so breathtaking that it is now ranking at #20 in my top films.  See it!
0375804013|5.0|The Monster at the End of This Book  May 21, 2000<br /> Reviewer:  jkteacher (see more about me) from Yakima, WA   Don't order this book!  No, don't buy it! ... You already ORDERED it? Oh NO! Now, you're going to  have to listen to your toddler giggle every time you turn the page after  Grover tells you NOT to turn the page. This is a classic! I read this book  to my son, Mark, when he was a toddler. He's 23 years old now and I know  he'd remember the story as if it were yesterday. He loved interacting with  the character, Grover, as though Grover were right there inside the book  talking to him. It's a great book to read when you or your toddler are  feeling grouchy, too.
6305358567|5.0|which is why we watch movies anyway, right? Blanchett portrays a great Elizabeth and we watch the anguished evolution of a young naive princess to a worldly-wise Queen. Joseph Fiennes is superb as Dudley, though it's hard  to sympathize with an adulterous dolt who wants to have his cake and eat   it too. But Geoffrey Rush...wow...an incredible performance developing the  deliciously complex character of Walsingham, (lots of lessons to be learned  from the portrayal of Walsingham...lots of lessons...)It's doubtful that  the real Elizabeth Tudor was this naive or this scrupulously just; but as a  story in its own right this movie does a splendid job of peeling back human  motivations and  ignorance and the unlikely places we can find allies...
B00004T8RK|4.0|I've been a loyal Pearl Jam fan since day one, and I have yet to be dissapointed by any of their releases.  But they have a lot to live up to and, as much as I hate to say it, this is my least favorite PJ album to  date.  I'd still recommend it, but it's definately got a narrow range by  Pearl Jam standards.  The tempo is largely quasi-slow with no real Porch or  Sonic Reducer-ish fast songs.  <br />Now don't get me wrong- I still  thoroughly enjoyed this CD and I recommend it.  Many of the tracks like  'Nothing is as it Seems' and 'Grievence' are very solid.  But, if you had  no other Pearl Jam CD's and you could only afford one, I'd recommend  Vitalogy or Yield.
B000002H97|5.0|&quot;The Black Album&quot; is Metallica's Best.  The album starts with their best song ever &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;. Other great tracks are Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Dont Tread on Me, Of Wolf  and Man, and Struggle within.  You can listen to this album over and over  again and never get tired of it.  If you just started listening to  Metallica you should buy this album.  Then work your way back to the old  stuff.  Trust me you won't be dissapointed!
B00000IO4I|5.0|I was highly impressed with Little Voice. It is a film that moved me, made me laugh, and almost made me cry. The acting is simply awesome, especially by the wonderful Jane Horrocks, and the awesome Brenda Blythen. <br />Laura  Hoff (Horrocks) is a soft-spoken young woman living in Britian, who gets  called Little Voice, for she does not speak often. When Ray (Michael  'Marvellous' Caine) discovers her ability to sing like Judy Garland,  Marilyn Monroe and Shirly Bassie, he leads her to showbusiness. But how  does L.V. feel?<br />I guarantee you will not be disappointed with Little  Voice, it is a heartfelt yet funny comedy that keeps you stuck to your  seat. Enjoy!
6303327982|2.0|Anyone who says this movie is an artistic representation of society is warped, or else doesn't have a whole lot of upbringing.  While this film was artistic, in the manner the film was manipulated and altered, not only  to make the work more attractive to the eye, but to also to make certain  points in the film evident, it is still a piece of garbage.  Violence made  with astronomical box office sales in mind.  They succeeded.<br />Now, while I  say that the movie is purely written to satisfy the American audience's  lust for violence, I also like it; I was raised with bloodshed, rape and  other forms of &quot;entertainment&quot; thrust upon me until I found it to  be normal.  So, in that respect, this film was entertaining.  <br />May the  Lord help us all.
B00001NFCY|4.0|I just went to the Creed concert last night and for anyone who claims that Creed is not a Chrisitan band then maybe they can explain why Scott Stapp stood up and said &quot;There is only one way, God's Way&quot;  They are  Christian and thank God Almighty!
0062513346|5.0|The Valkyries is a metaphysical tale, very much in the spirit of James Redfield, only this epic tale is authentic.<br />This is Paulo Coelho's astonishing true story of his encounter with darkness, his search for the  light, and the seeking of his personal angel.  He chronicles his journey  from Brazil, with his wife Chris, and their 40-day sojourn in the Mojave  Desert, seeking the Valkyries.  The Valkyries were rumored to be able to  speak and to see their angels.  Having fought a battle with darkness, Paulo  has redeemed his life and is a seeker of the light.  Paulo was also told  that \\"people wind up killing what they love most\\" as he seeks to rectify  certain, if not all, areas of his life.<br />This book is journey of faith, of  trust, of forgiveness, of love, of self-discovery, and of battling the  darkness within ourselves, and wanting to change.  As Paulo states, \\"Faith  is a different conquest, and it requires daily combat in order to  maintained.\\"  His faith is tested to the very end, as he seeks contact with  his angels.  His journey within transforms him as well as transforming his  wife at the same time.  Their two soul journeys will inspire you.<br />\\"We are  responsible for everything that happens in this world.  We are the warriors  of the light.  With the strength of our love and our will, we can change  our destiny, as well as the destiny of many others.\\"  In this age of angel  sightings, angel occurrences are happening with intense frequency.  It is  as if God is sending his messengers with a message and that message if one  of love.  The stories being written give hope to those in need of hope and  bring home the message that there is another way - love.<br />\\"If on the other  hand, we accept all that is wrong about us - and despite it, believe that  we are desiring of a happy life - then we will have thrown open an immense  window that will allow Love to enter.  Little by little, our defects will  disappear, because one who is happy can look at the world only with love -  the force that regenerates everything that exists in the universe.\\"<br />This  is an amazing book, which will cause you to think and revaluate parts of  your life.  I read the book in one sitting and had to keep going with it  till the very end.  If you are on a spiritual journey or even on a  transforming journey at this point in your life, this is one book that you  will want to read.  As Paulo says, \\"God is love, generosity and  forgiveness; if we believe this, we will never allow our weakness to  paralyze us.\\"  I highly recommend this book.the world only with love -  the force that regenerates everything that exists in the universe.\\"<br />This  is an amazing book, which will cause you to think and revaluate parts of  your life.

B00000FCBC|5.0|This cd does not represent what Metallica is all about.  The cover older songs beautifully and add a heavy metal side to them.  They DONT cover on any of their albums except this one!   The first cd feature songs such as,  Turn The Page, Die Die My Darling, Tuesday's Gone, and Whiskey in a Jar.   The second cd features songs such as, Am I evil?,  Blizkreig, Breadfan, and  Stone Cold Crazy.  DO NOT start your Metallica collection with this cd.   Start with &quot;The Black Album&quot; then get the older stuff and after  all of that get &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;.
B000002WYT|5.0|Dave Matthews is a creative genius, and he shows it to us in this album. The album varies from the soothing calm of Crash, to the energy of Too much in a perfect combination. Very few artists can write and perform their own  songs this well, but Dave Matthews does an excellent job. I look forward to  his next album
B00004THAY|5.0|Two of the greatest guitarists in history made some of the greatest music on this CD.  Even for people who aren't normally into blues, you must buy this.  BB King's guitar is unmistakeable -- sweet, bending notes that will  make you say &quot;Well well well!&quot;  This is the blues.  Very highly  recommended!
B00000J6AG|5.0|Please, whatever you do, do not be put off by the album's 'techno' classification. I thought about buying it when I heard everyone raving about it a while back but then I read reviews which said it was a techno  album, and I am not a fan of dance or techno music. So, I put off buying  it. After hearing one excellent single too many, I took the plunge. I am so  glad I bought it. I was only expecting to like a few tracks, but I was in  for a real surprise. Nearly all of the tracks are superb. 'Techno' is quite  simply the last category I would put this album into.  This album is so  unique that it cannot really be classified. Moby is obviously very talented  musically. Every song on this album is of a high quality, and there are  some fantastic stand-out tracks, most noticably the blues-inspired  &quot;Run On&quot; and the gorgeous, lush, mellow track  &quot;Porcelain&quot;. There are a few upbeat tracks on the album, but I  even like these. One sincerely hopes Moby is able to use his talents to  produce more records like this in the future.  If you are in doubt as to  whther this album is worth the cash, plese let me assure you it is. You  will almost certainly recognise many tracks, as movies, advert and TV shows  have been using these songs.  You'll have to buy the album to understand  how good it is. The range of styles and instruments Moby uses is huge, and  the result is truly a classic. You will not be disappointed.
0440180295|5.0|I felt this was a great book. It really made me think about how I felt about nationalism.Vonnegunt uses many puns and clever cynicisms to weave a great story. It was so good I read it in one sitting.
B000002H97|5.0|This cd is by far Metallica's best.  The cd starts with one of Metallica's bets songs &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; .

You can listen to this cd over and over again  and never get tired of it.  If you are just starting a Metallica collection  then this is the perfect cd to start with.  This is not an extremely fast  and head banging cd.  If you want a fast paced, head banging cd then you  should go with Master of Puppets!
B00004T8RK|2.0|I give 2 starts for the cover artwork and for the massive promotion. The music is as good as good as any other Pearl Jam album in the mid and late 90's, if you like those albums, listen to them insted of buying another one  who sounds pretty much the same (though seems like the quality here is very  poor. now what kind of stupid gimic is that! ).
B00004TL21|4.0|this is one of those cd's that seem to grow on me One of the first things that i noticed was that the cd had a mellower feel to it such as in the song change. The first time i listened to it i didn't like it all that much  but it grew on me. I would recomend it to any one who will listen to it for  a second before giving it up.....a very good cd worthy of 4 or more starz
6305718954|4.0|I confess that I went to see this movie because Patricia Arquette had a major role in it.  And while I thought she did a very good job in Stigmata, the message of the movie made me see it a second time.  This is not a  horror movie...not an Exorcist remake.  There were some major holes in this  movie, but its message and the visuals overshadow the weaknesses.   What's  right about it:  The acting is more than adequate(Byrne &amp; Arquette).   The overall message that organized religion is often very self-serving for  very human factions is undeniable!  Stigmata very effectively makes the  point that buildings and group of stodgy old men aren't a necessary part of  your relationship with any higher power you might recognize.  Visually,  this movie is quite often stunning.   What's wrong about it:  I felt that  the movie would have been better served with a classical soundtrack(i.e.-  Wagner) than with the modern techno tracks that were present throughout the  movie.  It would have been much creepier with an orchestra or violins.   There were times when it looked more like a music video than a major motion  picture.  There is  a gaping hole in the middle of the story.  I can't say  much without giving something away, but what you eventually find out is  wrong with Frankie(Arquette) is inconsistant with the scene in the middle  of the movie where her character tries to seduce Byrne.   In conclusion, it  is certainly worth overlooking the flaws to get the deeper message.  If  you're not into messages, don't worry.  Stigmata is graphic and Patricia  Arquette is stunning.
6305165912|5.0|why are some people so reserved in their praise of comedy? maltin stupidly called this a &quot;minor Coen concoction&quot;, and how so? - are Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink &quot;major&quot; because their themes are darker?  The Big Lebowski is their equal, if not their better, in construction and  contrivance, and its purpose - amusement - is fulfilled with such alacrity  that it holds value long after the first viewing. such diuturnal comedy -  and this is first-class - should be acclaimed, same as good tragedy and  drama, because its exploration of humanity is far more pleasurable, and no  less meaningful.
0684803356|5.0|This novel brings one into close contact with the forces in dreadful conflict during civil war--Solidarity versus Brutality; Hemingway portrays both thoroughly. The story told by Pilar in this book seemed to haunt me  for a few days, the images were so clear, and as one will find by reading  it, it is a story which has a very grave lucidity, as if you wished  Hemingway would drown the scene in a sea of lifeless and complex words.   The descriptions of the love story and Jordan's internal motivations  immediately soothe the unsettling images of war, and the novel as a whole  works paradoxically to the point where both sets of images collide, and  leave the reader both unsettled and fulfilled simultaneously.
B00004TL21|4.0|White Pony is a CD that has something for everyone.  There are the hardcore songs like elite and korea that get your adrenaline going.

The first time I listened to this cd I didn't like it but  now it grows on me with every listen.

B00004THAY|4.0|Eric Clapton is always at home when he plays the blues.  Despite lacking the intensity of From the Cradle, &quot;Riding With the King&quot; returns EC to the genre with which he is most talented, and with which he displayes  the full range of his talents.  When he parts company, as in &quot;I Want  to Marry You&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be&quot;, the quality suffers by  comparison.  All in all though, it is a good outing. Particularly on note  is the acoustic material, making you wish for the release of a &quot;E. C.  and B. B. Unplugged&quot; CD.  These are two of the remaining blues  masters, and the well from which they could draw is deep.  I just wish they  would have dropped the bucket a little deeper and challenged themselves to  a greater degree.  Still this is a rewarding set, and makes you hunger for  what is yet to come.
B00000JNO2|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is one of the best Skynyrd albums that is out there.  The two guitars do extremely well without being cluttered by a third guitar as they often are.  There is a wide range of songs, from the  rocking beat of Gimme Back My Bullets, to the melodic 12-string guitar on  Roll Gypsy Roll.  You will not be dissappointed!
B000002B7S|5.0|If you only have enough cash for one CD and have your heart set on something by OZZY, this is the only one you'll need. Black Sabbath was untouchable, and the Rhoads' albums are classic...but Ozzy shared the  limelight with both bands. This album is by far the best effort put forth  by the father of Heavy Metal, and he really gets to take center stage.  After this album, his songs took a turn for the worse, entering a more  commercialized style...blatantly evident on such albums as &quot;The  Ultimate Sin&quot; and &quot;No Rest for the Wicked.&quot; Although OZZY  did reinvent himself in the 90's with &quot;No More Tears&quot;, it doesn't  come close to Bark at the Moon. From the first note to the very last, this  album will leave you howling for more...and it never gets boring. I first  heard this album back in '85, and it has not grown stale over all these  years. In fact, I love it more with every listening. The remastered version  is great, but the bonus track &quot;Spiders in the Night&quot; was an  unnecessary addition...how can you add to something that is already  perfect? Do yourself a favor...buy Bark at the Moon, love Bark at the Moon,  and pass Bark at the Moon down to your children. It simply is OZZY at his  best.
006092988X|4.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the story of Francie Nolan, her brother Neeley and all of the people who live with them in Brooklyn. It is sort of a documentary of Francie's growing up. This book has so much detail and  excitement that it is hard not to understand, although it may seem  complicated when you first pick it up. This is a good book for people age  10 and up, and is the perfect book to buy for the ummer- it would be ideal  to bring to a cottage or on a camping trip.   Altogether, this is a  fantastic book that you don't want to miss.

0380713802|3.0|I always enjoy reading Bill Bryson's books, but this was a little disappointing. I have the same mixed feelings about the book as he does the places he's describing. He moves around too quickly, and although he seems  to have a good &quot;feel&quot; for the cities etc. he visits, they are  inevitably a bit superficial. Indeed, some of his observations are flawed.  For example, he must be joking when he says that, &quot;the Italians  technological contribution to humankind stopped with the pizza oven&quot;.  A typical Anglo-Saxon stereotype, and, as it happens wildly inaccurate: the  Italians are fine engineers, and....what about Marconi, for example?<br />I  also found his (Anglo-Saxon) &quot;can't (won't) speak the language&quot;  attitude rather irritating. With a little more effort, perhaps he might  have done better.
0590353403|5.0|The genre of this book is historical fiction because a lot ofthis story is true in different places such as castles which are inmany different places of the world.  Three headed dogs have existed before while just this summer a two headed cat was born.  With so many &quot;legends&quot; of witches and wizards, they must be real or where did they get the idea?  Just because you don't see something doesn't mean it isn't there.  It is also fiction because it came out of the author's head.  There are many great characters in this book.  The main main character is Harry Potter who is the boy that lived.  He was the only person to survive Lord Voldemort.  He got a scar but his parents got murdered.  Harry discovered he was the most famous wizard when he was 10 years old.  He goes to Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry.  Throughout the book he becomes the first first-year student in the century to become a Quidditch player.  He keeps Lord Voldemort from getting the Sorcerer's Stone which would have let him live forever.  Ron is Harry's best friend.  He has 7 brothers and sisters that are mentioned throughout the book.  Fred, George and Percy are the only ones who are still in Hogwarts.  Hermione is the straight A student who saves Harry's neck millions of times. Snape is the Potions Master who hates Harry because he hated his dad, James Potter.  Voldemort, A.K.A.  YOU-KNOW-WHO, A.K.A. HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED, tried to kill harry as a baby and wants to live forever by stealing the sorcerer's stone.  Voldemort gets Professor Quirrell to do his dirty work for him.  The plot line is hilarious.  For instance, Harry unleashes a boa constrictor, who has never seen South America, on his bratty cousin, Dudley.  Harry's best friend, Ron, has twin brothers who always make wise cracks like mixing their names up into Gred and Forge instead of Fred and George. Another time in a game of Quidditch, Harry almost swallowed the Snitch, which is a small, walnut sized, very fast, flying ball with wings.  The plot line is always surprising.  Sometimes incredibly normal things happen, and sometimes, just plain old weird stuff happens.  Harry nearly gets killed twenty times.  For starters, Quirrell tries to curse his broom in a Quidditch match.  Snape performs a counter curse and Hermione bumps into Quirrell so he can't perform the curse.  Another time is when Marcus Flint blocks Harry and nearly knocks him off his broom.  Harry nearly gets smashed into oblivion when he and Ron save Hermione from a troll.  Harry almost got crushed in the Devil's Snare while he was trying to catch Snape.  When Harry is in the Forbidden Forest, a Centaur saves him from Lord Voldemort's possible spell.  I recommend this book to anybody because its plot line is easy to follow, it's hilarious, filled with adventure, near death experiences and plain old fun.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest, I give it an 11!
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones have always swallowed the indignity of standing just behind KoRn and, now, Limp Bizkit in the public's cultural consciousness. With WHITE PONY, Deftones don't so much turn their backs on the rapcore genre as  expand their definition of it.<br />The heaviest moments come in the dense  balance between the rhythm section's intensity and Chino Moreno's  whisper-come-blister vocal delivery. It's a Deftones signature raised here  to teasing, stunning heights. But WHITE PONY is more moody, earthy and  breathy than anything else in the band's short catalog, stepping the  Deftones into the realm of art metal.<br />Deftones are taking more chances  with electronics and finding footing in the elusive, dynamic ground between  soft and bombastic. This might not satisfy those solely driven to mosh and  headbang, and WHITE PONY doesn't profess to speak to anyone's so-called  &quot;sickness&quot; -- the buzzword of so many rapcore contemporaries.  Then again, Deftones have always carried and explored their own soul. Now,  with WHITE PONY, they're riding to other untamed vistas.
B00004TL21|5.0|0ne of the Deftones best albums yet!  The thing I like about the Deftones is that they always continue throughout their albums manage to keep the same style.  They never change so dramaticaly that they sound like a  totally new band.  When ever bands do change their sound or style, the  effect is just not the same.  This is why I like this album so much.  It's  different but the style and the sound has remained, and it's for that  reason why the Deftones are so great.By the way...this is a totally awsome  CD!
0446310786|4.0|I really liked this book except for the fact that it was a pretty slow reader for me. It has a good plot, characters, story, and a pretty good ending. There were many boring points in my opinion during this book.  <br />  Scout and Jem are brother and sister(Scout's the girl). This story tells of  their growing up together with a friend of theirs named Dill, who comes to  Maycomb every summer. He and Scout want to get married some day. ^_^ <br />  One of the goals of the children is to get a peek at the mysterious  neighbor of theirs, Boo Radley. They have heard lots of stories about Boo  like when he was cutting up newspapers and stabbed his mother in the  leg...(eek!) <br /> Boo Radley had never left his house. One of the children  at Jem and Scout's school even goes a mile out of her way walking home just  to avoid having to walk by the Radley Place. <br /> The kids decide to make a  game called &quot;Boo Radley&quot;. It starts to turn into a play and they  end up playing it for a very long time. It tells of the story of Boo and  his life(I'm guessing that Scout, Jem, and Dill made up some of it on their  own). <br /> Will they ever see Boo? And if they do, what does he look like?  How will they meet? What would they say? Maybe they won't even see  him...you'll have to find out for yourself. ^_^

0792156684|3.0|This film was so popular, that I have to ask, &quot;Can millions of people be wrong?&quot;  <br />You bet they can.<br />The technical aspects of this film were GREAT!  Watching the ship sink, the people go flipping off into  space...chilling.  But the only highlight of the thin love story was Kate  Winslett's nude scene.  I know, I'm a dog!  But it was!  Leonardo DiCaprio  was a good fit for this movie, but Winslett's talents were wasted, and I'm  relieved to see that she has forsaken the big bucks for unique and  interesting movies (like Jude, Holy Smoke, Hideous Kinky--excellent movies,  all).<br />This movie presents shallow stereotype after stereotype, offering  DiCaprio as the noble, Poor-But-Proud Youth (an artist, of course), Billy  Zane as the Evil Rich Guy who is engaged to Winslett, the Naive Ingenue.  Gack! You've seen this story many times before, and much better than it is  presented here. Most people with any sense of fairness will detest the  stereotyping of The Rich in this movie...it is nothing short of bigotry,  but, alas, culturally acceptable bigotry. <br />The sad thing is, all the  actors, really, are good actors...clearly, they wanted to be in a James  Cameron blockbuster, because, unless they had a coma-like lapse of taste,  the script certainly couldn't have been what attracted them to this  project.<br />Great for 10-year-old girls, maybe, but as a movie for adults,  ordinary out of all proportion to its success.

B00004TL21|5.0|I think this is a very strong and diverse album. Though clearly not as hard as expected, it has some cool stuff. Like in the second song it is like he is singing in the bathroom supported by waterdrop guitar licks. And  the song Passenger with Tool singer Keenan: WOW!  What a great song(and  surprise!), the first time you sometimes must really pay attention who  sings/whispers when, those two voices are mixed so cool, sensual and full  of tension!  Just buy this album, you won't regret it. What a beautiful  year.. pfff... who's next? Tool ?

The acting is great (especially John Malkovich's) and the monkey  story is jaw dropping. I really loved watching this film.
B00004TL21|3.0|When I bought this CD I was like &quot;Whoa, Dude. It's the new Deftones CD&quot;!  When I finally got it home and listened to it I was a bit sad. I thought this would make me jump up and down on my bed like a 5 year old.  Instead, It made me sit and think about stuff. A real bummer dude!  The  other two albums got me totally stoked and ready to rip but not this one.  I'm not saying it's bad or anything but when I buy a Deftones album I wanna  rock and stuff not think about politics and other heinous stuff. This CD is  not as rad as some of their other stuff. The first two albums are wicked  sick!

B00003W8NM|5.0|What can I say, its the best DVD thats ever been released. The movie is great, but if that isn't enough you get a whole disc of extras. You can watch the movie while the actors and director comment,which is cool. You  see how effects were done,deleted scenes, TV ads for it, interviews, theres  just so much stuff it would take days to see it all. If you own a DVD  player: buy it.
B00004TL21|5.0|the deftones have always rocked, and if you're gonna rock you gotta rock hard and thats what these guys do they have always rocked from their first album to this one and if you can catcg them live do it cause they KICK A$$
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam is one of maybe 5 bands whose album I will be sure to buy the day it hits the rack. Their music wakes me up and makes me feel alive. They don't dwell in pain and irony for the sake of pain and irony like 99% of  what I hear on the radio these days. Pearl Jam searches for something  deeper and they usually find it. It's not in the lyrics or the style, it's  simply in the feel of the music. There is a freedom to their take on rock  and roll that transcends the blocky, cookie cutter shape of so much modern  music. All I can say about Binaural is that it does what I had hoped it  would do, it made me feel. It is, to date, Pearl Jams most well rounded  album. There is no filler. Just lots of very good musicianship and some  ever-improving songwriting. Anyone who believes that PJ has been in a  downhill slide ever since Ten hasn't been paying attention. Their  detectable loss of energy since 10 years ago has simply been replaced by  more sure footed outlook and a more confident attitude. They are 10 years  older and as people mature, they stop fighting worthless battles and begin  to accept the world they live in and play with it. Take anything that U2  has done post Joshua Tree. Gone are the angst ridden anti-war mantras and  the over the top soul searching. They sought and found what they were  looking for and went off in a totally different direction and had fun with  it. This is what PJ is beginning to do, much to this listeners approval.
6305297207|3.0|It seems that Evil Dead II was effectively an improved remake of Evil Dead 1.  Nothing in the story line is lost by skipping Evil Dead 1 altogether.  For example, Ash discovers the same taperecorder (for the first time) in  both movies, as if the events in ED1 never happened.  Yes, ED1 is creative,  for a low budget movie, but EDII is much better.  The combination of EDII  and Army of Darkness can't lose as a slapstick comedy horror  double-feature.  Save money and skip ED1.
B00004THAY|5.0|At last I found the CD with the &quot;old&quot; blues solo's played by Clapton. I always loved Clapton and also B.B. King but together the play the stars fom the sky.

B00000IPAX|5.0|This CD was so excellent. I got it cuz I liked Blink 182 back in the days of &quot;Dammit&quot; and I liked the popular songs &quot;All the Small Things&quot; and &quot;Whats My age again?&quot; and when I got it I also  liked the track &quot;Going away to college&quot;. Then &quot;Adams  Song&quot; became popular and that song is ok but not great. In the cover  of the album, it shows a hillarious line of dudes waitin' to get an ennema  from the chick on the cover. The other tight thing is this is a CD rom. Put  it in and it has a bonus video. Very neat. I like this CD a hell lot and I  give it 5 stars.
0764009842|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It had all of the right elements, a great plot, plus a good balance of of good and evil.  But most importantly, the movie was filled with wonderful insights, and delicate displays of love and  compassion. I was glued to my seat the whole time!  Long film, but worth  every single second!  Truly a warm and loving film, with some of the finest  acting that I've seen to date!

B00000DHRZ|5.0|Hi, I'm reviewing on this title that I've had ever since its come out and since I've had it for a while, I'm not TO inthusiastic about it. But this CD shant be missed out apon. Its got the punk band's finest with &quot;Get  a Job&quot; and &quot;Shes got Issues&quot; with other good songs such as  &quot;Starring at the Sun&quot;, &quot;Walla Walla&quot;, and &quot;Pretty  Fly for a white guy&quot;. By the way, this CD is a CD rom itself.
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones has done it again, this cd is different than their other two- they've said that they feel like making the type of music they want to at the time, so they dont stick to only one type of hard-core sound- but this  cd is great and does deserve 5 stars, with Maynard James Keenan from  &quot;tool&quot; and &quot;a perfect circle&quot; singing on the song  &quot;passenger&quot; how can you not be interested in hearing it? it is a  great cd for any hardcore fan, buy it now! you wont be sorry! later!

B00004T8RK|3.0|Not a bad CD, but if this had been their first album, nobody would ever hear again of Pearl Jam! Personally I think the songs are not bad but they are not particularly inspired, they are written in Pearl Jam style, played  very well, but it seems like they are not Pearl Jam, really, just a bad  copy!  Where is the inspiration that pervaded their early works? Even the  last album had some great songs, this one is really more flat, no great  peaks, neither bad songs, but they certainly can do better!
B00004U8JV|5.0|Just when you'd think that scientists had realized dinosaurs and humans don't mix, along comes The Lost World: Jurassic Park to prove you wrong. In this sequel, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) summons chaos theorist and  onetime colleague Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to his home with some  startling information - while nearly everything at his Jurassic Park had  been destroyed, his engineers happened to have a second site, where other  dinosaurs, resurrected through DNA cloning technology, were kept in hiding.  It seems the dinosaurs on the second island are alive and well and even  breeding; and Hammond wants Malcolm to observe and document the reptiles  before Hammond's financiers can get to them. Malcolm had enough of the  dinosaurs the first time out, but he decides to make the trip when he finds  out that his girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is  already there. However, Ian and Sarah aren't the only visitors arriving on  the island; a camera crew led by ecological activist Nick Van Owen (Vince  Vaughn) is on the way, as is Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), a  world-class wild game hunter who is supposed to round up the dinosaurs and  who hopes to bag a prehistoric trophy for himself in the process. This  sequel to Jurassic Park boasted even more impressive special effects than  the first film, though the acting and screenplay aren't always at the same  level.<br />This DTS version has less extras (Deleted Scenes, Illustrations  and Conceptual drawings, Storyboards, Models, The World of Jurassic Park,  Industrial Light and Magic), but the sound is sure going to compensate  that. The French Surround is not available too. Thats why it is on you to  decide whats more valuable.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I am not their greatest fan, I liked BSSM and I did not really like their following CD, but this one is just really really good! Some great rock songs, the best ones are &quot;Other side&quot;, Californication, Parallel  Universe, Easily. All tunes with a great melody, well played. But the whole  CD is just the right mix between funky and rock, more on the rock side and  less on the funky side, which is exactly why I like it more than their  average CD, it's really pure rock. It reminds me of Neil Young at its best.  If you do not own it yet, buy it, trust me it's good!
0345339703|3.0|I know I'll probably go to hell for saying this, but I really do not see why Tolkien is so popular. I can not deny that he writes intelligently. His world is undeniably well thought out. However, it seems to me that his  style of writing is out of date and if he wrote the Lord of the Rings  Trilogy today-- it would flop. His story is bogged down with detail (most  of it unnessasary), the plot is typical (yes I know his story is the  protoype for modern fantasy writers)and his characters seem very flat as  compared to the demand we put on writers today for well rounded characters.  I have great respect for Tolkien, but I think some readers love him only  because of his reputation and not for his work. His style of writing is now  extinct.
B000005J56|5.0|I first heard of Buena Vista Social Club through a colleague of mine.  He would play this CD in his office and I found the melodies quite rhythmic and haunting.<br />Once I purchased my copy of this wonderful CD, I was really  hooked.  The more I listen to it, the more I love it.  The love and emotion  for the artists' craft comes through and leaves an indelible mark on each  listener's heart.<br />These once forgotten musicians through the help of Ry  Cooder have been able to share their traditional melodies with the western  world.<br />I was amazed to see how successful this album's sale have been for  a world music title.  But a few listens later, it didn't surprise me at  all.  I guess people just know great music when they hear it even when it  crosses ethnic and language boundaries.<br />By the way, I'm an audiophile and  the sound quality on this album is exceptional.  The sound has a lot of  depth and ambiance.  Try this CD in a high end audio system and you'll  experience a certain intimacy you don't find in most traditional studio  albums.
B000002GXJ|4.0|Love them or hate them, the Eagles have had a huge impact on rock music. To paraphrase Ringo Starr, there are biggies and there are monsters. These guys were monsters in terms of sales, airplay and impact.<br /><br />Frequently  accused of being misogynistic (yep, some of their stuff could be seen that way)Henley & Frey are  still two of the most talented songwriting duos in music. Henley has one of  the most distinctive and rich voices in rock music while Frey is an  underrated singer who can easily hold his own with Henley.<br /><br />So how are the  performances? This album (it should be noted that this had a lot of overdubbing in the studio as the band members are perfectionists)is pretty good as far as live albums go. In many respects this is no different than listening to their studio albums although some of the energy of the raw performances leak through. While they  weren't noted for their spontanity in concert (their performances were  always rooted in recreating the sound of the albums, the band does bring a  harder edge to these performances. Joe Walsh acts as band clown on his  contributions and still manages to get in some mean guitar licks (with  Felder & Frey). Back up drummer Joe Vitale does a great job of helping  to fill out Henley's performance.<br /><br />The sound on this remastered edition is  exceptional. Producer Bill Szymczyk and remaster engineer Ted Jenson (although the previous edition sounded terrific as well)do an incredible job.  It would have been nice  to have bonus tracks (perhaps a couple of unreleased performances) and  better notes in the CD booklet (it would have been interesting to hear the  band's thoughts on this album twenty years later).<br /><br />Despite these minor  drawbacks, Szymczyk is to be commended for getting the ball rolling with  WEA to get these classic albums remastered. Regardless of the shortcomings  (and there aren't many) of this reissue, the songs are the most important  part. They still retain their vigor and power despite radio overexposure  after all these years.r and power despite radio overexposure  after all these years.

0812589041|4.0|Despite the \\"hokeyness\\" of the cover of the book, the contents within are quite good.  I read this book within a week and had a hard time putting the book down, it was a quick read and I anticipate reading the follow-up  novels.  The hero, Ender, is a 6-year old genius child that is slated to  save the world.  He is put through intensive and almost abusive situations  in order to create the mind of an adept commander.  Before his 2nd stage in  duty, Ender ends up on Earth for a time of reflection at a wilderness  retreat - this is one of the saddest part of the books.  <br />I liked the  book very much, however, I found the age of the characters to be too young  for the mature situations.  I'm not sure how believable it is for a 6-year  old to have the sophisticated thoughts that Ender displays.  Nevertheless I  found the book very enjoyable and recommend
B000002J27|5.0|Remember how George Harrison released five years' worth of stifled songwriting creativity after the Beatles' breakup, with the masterful &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;?<br /><br />I have to qualify this by saying  that I'm a huge Gabriel-era Genesis fan.  For the most part, I can do  without the Phil Collins era (okay, &quot;Duke&quot; is pretty good).  I  even prefer Ray Wilson's work on &quot;...Calling All Stations...&quot; to  most of Phil's.  But despite that, I have to say that &quot;A Trick of the  Tail&quot; is my single favorite Genesis album, PERIOD.<br /><br />As wonderful  as Peter was, he really had demanded too much control over the songwriting.   As a result, this first album sans Peter - where they were clearly under  enormous pressure to prove that they could survive without him - ended up  being like a songwriters' and instrumentalists' clinic.<br /><br />Tony Banks's  songwriting, Mike Rutherford's and Steve Hackett's guitar playing, and Phil  Collins's singing and drumming all get a great workout here, and there  isn't a single clunker in the bunch - &quot;Squonk,&quot; &quot;Dance on a  Volcano,&quot; and &quot;Entangled&quot; are the clear winners here, though  Banks's keyboards really shine on &quot;Ripples&quot; and &quot;Mad Man  Moon.&quot;  Only &quot;Robbery, Assault &amp; Battery&quot; ever strikes  me as a bit dated or campy - but it's strong enough instrumentally to  overcome the somewhat forced lyrics.<br /><br />I never get tired of listening to  this one on roadtrips, and it often rocks harder than much of their other  work.  So - despite preferring 1969-75 Genesis overall - it's usually the  album I use to introduce newbies to the band.  My recommendation is without  reservation.
0767903854|5.0|Note:  I read the English Version of this book, titled \\"Down Under\\".  Question why the difference in names? I have loved all of Bryson's books.  He has a cynical yet affectionate way of viewing things that hits the nail  on the head but doesn't hammer the people or culture he is reviewing.  I  received &quot;Down Under&quot; yesterday, chuckled all through my lunch  break sitting at my desk at work and forgot to eat last night as I ploughed  on to finish.  Having done so at about 11pm I called my parents in Oz to  discuss the book (9am their time).  This is by far his most enjoyable book  to date in my opinion (whether he gets even better or this one was more  unputdownable because I am Australian I am not sure).<br />I found out things  about my own country that I had not known and laughed at his gentle ribbing  of the Australian psyche.  His fascination with the venomous side of the  Aussie bush struck a cord.  I can't count the number of times English  friends have asked how we live with all those life threatening animals  (this from a nation that has had 25+ years of terrorist threats from the  IRA!)  Even as an avid Australian cricket supporter I found his absurd  descriptions of the sport hilarious.  I would like to point out that his  own country invented an even sillier game.  Were else do grown men run  around in a type of ballet hose with enough padding on their chests to stop  a freight train? Unlike the reviewer from Melbourne, I loved the snippets  of history that Bryson used to flesh out the Australian culture and felt  they went a long way to help any non-Australian understand how an  essentially English colony can have ended up as such a sophisticated and  multi-cultural society.   While it is true that 80% of Australians live  within 80 miles of the sea and nearly all in the major cities (and Bryson  states this SEVERAL times) most travellers to the country would be doing  exactly what Bill did; see the great outback, so I felt the book was more  balanced than most travelogues on Australia have been.  I also admired the  accuracy of the book.  I have lived in both the US and UK and it still  amazes me the totally out of date and just plain false stereotypes that are  held about Australia.  It is a refreshing change to read a book where the  author has taken the trouble to look below the commonly held views and put  forward researched facts!<br />The only complaint I could find was why, when  so much of the book showed meticulous research, did he not look into the  history of our &quot;unofficial&quot; anthem &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;?   Just about any Aussie he asked and the numerous web sites dedicated to the  song's history that could have explained that the term &quot;waltzing  matilda&quot; was slang for going on the road as a swagman (itinerant  traveller). He had found out that &quot;Matilda&quot; was from the German  female name \\"Mathilda\\" but had failed to discover that this was an  affectionate term given by German soldiers to their great coats (kept them  as warm at night as a woman would).  &quot;Waltzing&quot; made its way into  the Aussie dictionary from our German settlers as well (there were a lot of  them in the last couple of decades of 1800s) and derives from the term  &quot;auf der walz&quot; (go on the walz or tramp) and referred to the  practice of an apprentice travelling around the country to gain experience  from different employers in their trade.  Bill Bryson praises the  egalitarian lifestyle he found in Australia.  It would have been nice if he  had included just a little of the history around &quot;Waltzing  Matilda&quot; as it was written as a political ballad at the time when  events that forged our society were taking place.  If you are interested  type &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; into a web search engine and learn a bit  more of Australia's forgotten history.<br />All up if I could give this book 6  stars I would and it has solved my gift giving ideas for the foreseeable  future.  Well done yet again Bill!
B000002NIW|5.0|Deftones defied the dreaded sophmore slump with the second installment from the mastermind Chino Moreno. With the pounding riffs of &quot;Lotion&quot;, &quot;head-up&quot;, and &quot;rickets&quot; to the  dwelling, but soothing, &quot;mascara&quot;, &quot;Dai the Flu&quot;, and   the hidden track &quot;Daemon&quot;, All display how well the Deftones can  play. This CD has even stronger points with its radio played &quot;My Own  Summer(shove it)&quot; and &quot;Be Quiet and Drive(far away)&quot;. A MUST  HAVE!  Also check out there 1st CD &quot;Adrenaline&quot; for an even  stronger Heavy.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Ok, first of all so have I judt started to listen to Pearl Jam, and I only have this album. To the point, there is many guys who say this one is bad, but I don´t think so, there is both calm and really hard-rock songs like  Breakerfall.<br />Do yourself a favour and go out and buy this record.
0767903854|4.0|Another smooth effort by Mr. Bryson. I bought this book solely for the entertainment value but the author managed to throw in a little history, geology, zoology, botany, etc. which to me was a bonus. As he says at the  start of the book, most people don't know anything at all about Australia.  It is almost never in the news. Geez, all my life I didn't realize I was  mispronouncing Canberra by putting the emphasis on the second syllable  rather than on the first! I had never heard of the prime minister, Harold  Holt, who in 1967 went for a swim which, as Mr. Bryson delicately phrases  it, &quot;required no towel&quot; and was never seen again! I didn't know  that people in Sydney make Melbourne jokes, such as &quot;Do you have any  children?&quot;  &quot;Yes, 2 living and 1 in Melbourne&quot;. If you read  this book you will also discover 12 foot earthworms, kangaroos that live in  trees, and the cassowary- which is as big as a person, looks like an emu  but has a bony growth on its head and a murderous claw on each foot. They  attack by jumping up and striking out with both feet together. The book is  full of interesting stuff like this, just about on every page. As Bryson  says, &quot;Australia, what a great place!&quot;

B000002H33|5.0|Metallica is my favorite rock band. I own all of their Cds  and i must say that &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is their best ever. I strongly urge you to go out and by this Cd.
B00004R960|5.0|With new bandmembers and a new sound to boot, the new album seems to stand out from the others, almost as if it was standing on the shoulders of giants. With more of a focus on ballads than rock tunes (I Can See A Liar  and Put Your Money Where Yer Mouth Is are the only real rock sounds on  here), and the definite trips outside of the boundaries of current pop  music (Who Feels Love? and Roll It Over). But it's that new found love for  balladry that puts this CD over the top. Ranging from Go Let It Out (in a  sense) through Where Did It All Go Wrong, Sunday Morning Call, and Roll It  Over. People who were fans of Whats The Story (Morning Glory) will fall in  love with Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Dido makes a great first impression with her &quot;No Angel&quot; cd.  Although not perfect (some of the songs do run together and sound similar), it is a great start, and I'm looking forward to seeing her blossom as an  upcoming force in the music business, hopefully becoming as noticeable and  recognizable as Sarah McLachlin.  The songs &quot;Thank You&quot;, bonus  track &quot;Take My Hand&quot;, and of course &quot;Here With Me&quot;  stand out as some of the strengths on this album.  So if you're looking for  something soothing, but artistically creative as well, check her out.  It's  well worth the money.
6304406096|2.0|Sean Connery came back in 1983 for Never Say Never Again. Though it is a treat to see Connery again, NSNA is a very thin effort. Just like the other unofficial Bond, Casino Royale (1967) the cast is very distinguished,  including Oscar winner Kim Basigner (L.A. Confidential), Oscar nominees  Klaus Maria Branduaer (Out of Africa) and Max Von Sydow (Pelle The  Conquerer), and Barbara Carrera, none of them can measure up to their  predecessors. Connery himself delivers a good performance, yet he looks a  bit too old. The motorcycle chase is entertaining but silly and  unrealistic. The fight at Shrublands is boring and isn't even  underwater.The plot is a basic retread of Thunderball (because NSNA is  actually a remake of it) and though it has a few new twists, they realy  don't make the film better at all. I like the casino scenes yet the video  game duel is so childish. Also, did I mention that Largo isn't a great  fighter, doesn't wear his trademark eyepatch, and isn't menacing? The song  and score aren't very good, but one of the worst things is there is no  Robert Brown, Lois Maxwell, or Desmond Llewelyn, and there replacements are  very silly, especially Moneypenny and M. Overall, I don't recommend this  film and try Thunderball instead.
6304806418|5.0|What can I say? Evita is a great film, that was wrongly underrated by both the audiences and the Academy (Evita got only one Oscar). I think this film is a true work of art, and if you never see the film, you will be missing  out on a superb work of cinematographic art -  One of the greatest  qualities of this film is that it does not excessively stray from the  original material (And when it does, it does so in the right places).  Andrew Lloyd Webber's great score gives this film the musical beauty that  made the Broadway production a hit almost thirty years ago. The script  contains the classic Tim Rice trademark - the ambiguity in characters. It  does not allow the viewer to say &quot;Aha - she's good!&quot;, or  &quot;Aha - she's bad!&quot;. There is plenty of evidence to support both  sides, leaving the viewer thinking about Evita even after seeing the movie  (How many other movies do you know that make the viewer think?).  As  for the cast, I think the actors performed surprisingly well. I further  think Banderas outdid Pattinkin. I'm sure Mandy's fans want to bite my head  off (or think that I lack one), and to them I say this -- The day I hear  Mandy perform &quot;sing you fools&quot; with enough emotion to make me  snarl with anger at communist dictatorships for days after seeing the film,  I'll change my views. True, Madonna is not a vocal superstar like Patti  LuPone, but considering that she performed the same role as Patti, with the  score transposed only one step down - all during a pregnancy, I think her  performance is rather commendable.  The cinematography itself is  stunning - There is not a single frame in the film at which you can say  &quot;What the heck are they showing me that?&quot;. Every shot is well  planned and contributes to the plot and the mood of the film.  The  bottom line - see this movie. You won't regret it.
