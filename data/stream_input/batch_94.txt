B00K00U3AC|5|Sakkas clothes are fab
B009GWLY94|5|5 stairs
B00LHK7QZO|5|This is a great buy, nice fit and very comfortable.  It even looks nice.
B00E89WNFE|5|The softest thing ever! Fit well!
B00NLFU146|5|Pretty small for size. Still love shirt
B00F2GM8TI|5|Bought these for my almost 30lb 2yr old she's extremely tall but these pants still have room to grown in them. She loved seeing her favorite character on the pants&asks to wear these every other day.
B007T27MC6|5|Nice trunks. Fits well and good quality.
B00O3D165S|5|They are comfy and the non-skid bottom on the bottom work
B005CW06X2|4|The picture shows multiple colors - we only got grey - but grey works!
B00PI8I2WM|5|Was worried about it being an import, but it was actually a very quality made item.  The material and the graphic are nicely done.
B00D3V16J2|5|This jacket serve it purpose for me during the rain and snow. It is what I expected during difficult weather.
B00JJI1FOE|4|Fur sheds a little
B007HJG9KW|4|This bra is very trendy. Boneless comfort.  I can wear this bra any day.  It fits nicely.  I was hesitant to buy a bra online as most women would be because I was unable to try it on, however I am happy with this purchase.  For me being a very heavy chested young lady I personally won't use this for any active sports -i.e. running or jogging - as indicated in the name but I would recommend it as a yoga or pilates bra.  I even joked that it looks like a cute swim top.  I would recommend to others but for my daily gym needs on the tread mill I would be a bit conscious and ensure people are aware of their limitations.  So if you don't intend to be running/jogging/jumping rope, etc you will be fine.
B000QAS2SG|5|Embassy Italian Stone Design Genuine Leather Personal Travel Bag<br />Sold by Brooklyn Deals and Fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />I really wasn't expecting much at the price I paid, but I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this travel bag. And very spacious, too. At this time, I have the following items in it:<br /><br />Full size can of Edge shaving gel<br />Full size tube of toothpaste<br />3.2 oz bottle of mouth wash<br />1.7 oz bottle of shampoo<br />Large stick of Axe deodorant<br />Battery-powered tooth brush<br />Disposable razor<br />Small box of 30 Q-Tips<br />Grooming kit (clippers, scissors, etc.)<br />Various smaller loose items<br /><br />This just about comes to 1/3 of the bag's capacity. And as mentioned in another review, it collapses to the size of the contents rather than taking up the volume of a full bag.
B00AIKUCEQ|1|The rise was SO low and I did not like the fit of them.
B008DSMEPK|5|Great jacket for those that like plain jackets. I don't like all the logos and things like that, so if you are looking for that then you found your product! Shipping is always fast with Amazon.
B00NAQRHHK|4|This is one of the cutest shirt and short set I own and I have to say I was pretty worried about what I was going to receive since there were no reviews. This fits me the way it fits on the model in the picture. The shirt and shorts are long but it is supposed to be baggy. I didn't see the little bow next to one of the ears in the picture and when I saw it I thought it was so cute. The print of the front is the white rabbit from Alice in wonderland and it says &#34;The white rabbit&#34; I believe. I have it at home so I THINK that's what it says ^~^<br /><br />Great buy.
B00IEDAROE|5|Very comfortable! Fun pattern to brighten up a boring outfit.
B007DXUBR4|5|great product shipped fast great quality very happy with this purchase would recommend this to any one that likes this kind of thing
B008CV5R4S|2|The full skirt is &#34;bunchy&#34; like a dirndl skirt so it is not becoming on my short frame.
B005QAQFP8|5|Great soft shirt.
B00BUDRQM6|5|perfect - stretchy to stay on and stay put!
B00L5I1T1U|2|To big
B00QARGLG4|5|Excellent
B008FVRHOI|5|I assumed there was a catch, an awesome looking skinny tie for this cheap? You cant even get a hideous Christmas tie on clearance in June for that price. But there is no catch, its clean, its quality, its kind of amazing that this exists, I just wish i wouldn't have wasted literally thousands of dollars on ties over the years!
B002SW3EUG|4|I like these a lot because they do wrap around his head.  However, they need to have more Velcro for a snug fit.
B006WVMCP2|5|We love the swim shorts. My husband is thin and these fit super great  We hate to go to the mall and these were nicer.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B004WK2EK8|4|i have nothing bad to say about this prouct fits well looks nice and its snazzy..however in the pic it is an earth rag hoodie. it just doesnt make any sense. but i love it! and whats this i read about fumes? i aired mine out just in case.
B0084B7BOA|1|I read reviews that this coat is more than size, but did not expect that much. Usually I wear 2XL and bought XL hoping it would be nice to fit.
B000W2KO0W|5|This coat is not too long, so you don't have to worry about tripping all over it. It is also light, yet warm. Now two things to keep in mind: 1) The color looks purple indoors, but burgundy outdoors. Both colors look very nice though. 2) Be patient with the zipper. It get stuck at the bottom if you try to connect it too fast. It is a strong zipper though, so you have to work very hard to break it.
B00EVPPH0S|4|Love it
B00J7C5Y8U|5|Great value, adorable outfit for any occasion
B0031ES7IY|3|These pajamas are really cute, but the quality of the fabric feels cheap.  They are very thin, so don't count on using these when it's cold.  Better for summertime.
B0091K9SXA|5|VERY WELL MADE. FAST SERVICE. AND REASONABLY PRICED
B00JU1WUGW|5|Would buy again ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆
B00HX186X2|5|Love it!!
B007SL5JP0|3|The dress is well made and the fabric is heavy in weight. It's also the type of fabric that doesn't wrinkle which is always a plus. The dress is flattering but it's very plain. Aside from the back, which is very pretty, the rest of the dress is a bit dull. For me there just wasn't the right balance between the back verses the front to justify the cost.
B004X639O6|5|Love this dress so comfortable easy to wash and wear!  Will order again!
B0007N7RXI|2|It reminds me of something you would buy for one of your children.  The visor is VERY flimsy and the hat is floppy.  I am going have to insert a piece of cardboard to keep the white part up above the visor.  Total waste of my money.
B00H2K5LL4|4|Has this item for about 2 months and it has performed as expected. It keeps me warm in the cold and appears to be well made.  I'm a 5'7&#34;, about 170 lbs with a slight muscular built and the item fits perfectly. Just the right amount of snugness to make it look slim fit if that's you're style. The only downside is that one of the lapels curves up. An iron didn't fix the issue so I'll have to take it to a dry cleaner to see if they could do something.
B005UVM368|5|Fits well for my tall frame.
B004G8PN4A|5|Very good.. really protect..
B00BG2LJBU|5|Great fit
B0000ANDEI|5|this coat can be worn in the field or to a meeting at the office.... it's good for the top floor of an open structure or the conference room or the shop.... keeps me VERY warm yet when unzipped is fine indoors.... GREAT BUY!.... the attachable hood stinks tho.... WAYYYYY TO SMALL! (see separate review)
B0030977AO|5|Works great
B009OAS4WS|4|this product is of very quality is very very good my wife is happy for this product, thanks for the atention
B00D6WTZKK|3|This dress was really cute but I ended up having to return it because it was waaaaay too short to wear in any kind of professional setting. I honestly can't imagine a scenario in which a dress like this would be appropriate - too dressy for casual wear, and far to short for any dressy setting.
B0034L72CG|4|I've worn Pendleton wool shirts since the 70s, as a kid we lived near the mill, and ever since I'll get one every few years to replace one that's worn through. This is my first sweater tho. I quite like it. I hate polartec fleece and there are few options like this anymore made of wool.<br /><br />The zipper can be a touch annoying, it is sometimes hard to get started. Why one would want a double zipper (two-way zipper? opens from the bottom also) is beyond my comprehension.<br /><br />Comfortable, warm in my icy house and not bulky.
B005FD52XM|3|I bought these for my girlfriend who is relatively tiny (5'2&#34;, lean arms, tight frame). Overall the gloves will do their job for the costume my girlfriend is being. (Marvel's Black Cat). They aren't as tight as they look in the photo, to the point where we might have to adjust them if they aren't tight after pulling them over the black body suit she's wearing.
B000147M88|5|Exactly as pictured.  This was a bit hard to get into (you really need to stuff yourself into it like a sausage) but once you're in, it looks great.
B008D550OA|5|Very much like these leggings!  Great color, well made, and so comfortable
B00JG62RJG|1|The cardigan is of poor quality. It is extremely thin and I will definitely be returning it.
B00N3M9ZJ4|5|I bought this and another jacket for my 7 year old during deal of day.  Incredible price for both jackets and both fit perfect and are of excellent quality.
B0035WTMEA|3|I found the bra too uncomfortable to wear, but I have very sensitive skin, and am unable to wear many materials. It is well made. The return was very easy.
B00171LN5W|5|Looked good
B005NS06KS|5|Very good value. You can't be too careful with your credit cards! Great for traveling also!
B00IPC1W0C|1|So the item in the picture is definitely not the item you receive. The seller trying to trick people is why this item is getting a 1.<br /><br />Now, the item isn't horrible! Considering it costs $10. The fabric is cheap spandex looking. The buttons are just cheap, a bit gaudy looking. No satin anywhere. I'm sure my guy will like it regardless... but still.<br /><br />It's kind of like a high school home economics student trying to replicate an item they see in a magazine... unfortunate. Glad I didn't pay more than $10!!<br /><br />Regardless, I would not recommend buying because super shady what the seller is doing.
B005FGM9U8|2|Extremely short, I am 6' and even extended to their max they are way to short. On top of that the clip button attachmets keep poping off my shirt if the shirt material is at all thick. I would personally look elsewhere.
B006RHNPEI|5|I'm a returning customer and this time I purchased these socks. My boy hasn't worn them yet but I always love this brand because they are comfortable.
B00L2QR11C|4|its cute
B00H02ZDT4|1|Does not stay in one place.
B00K1FQVY8|4|Fits a bit small. I wear a 34DD & the medium was a bit tight in rib cage. It's ok. Not the greatest but for $26 for 2, it's a good deal.
B00P679IIC|4|Look like denim, very comfortable
B0049RYA3S|5|I like the Harvard Square Long-Sleeve Oxford HS600W very much. I feel this shirt is of excellent quality, with a tappered fit, easy to launder...a feel good shirt. I just ordered two (2) more.
B0006SE656|5|Feels expensive? You are getting what you are paying for. Welcome to the world of secure storage of CD/DVD. I own this product since December, 2004. This high capacity light-weight CD/DVD wallet (with handle) is elegant, robust, but feels soft when you touch it. The company also provides a piece of cloth so that it takes care of dirt on the disks. The sleeves inside the wallet are made of good quality material so that they do not get stuck with each other at high temperature (specially, if you carry the wallet in the car). Not a single sleeve got damaged so far (I am a careful user)! The zippers are still running flawlessly! The only thing I like to be added to this cool wallet is index inserts for quick identification. After all, it is hard to identify a particular disk within such a huge wallet! It would also be nice to see a Slappa 500 Pro CD Case the next time I purchase. How about removable pages?
B0011FYKCM|5|I have a long torso and this tank fits perfect.  I have them in four colors now and wear them to the gym all the time.
B00EPYB3VM|4|BEAUTIFUL colour & the length is perfect for me. The top had to be taken even for me who is a bit more on the busty side. All in all a great dress for the price.
B00GU30NEO|5|At first when i first looked at the Size info i was thinking it wont be for me .. then i Messaged them and asked about it and they cleared up and explained it to me and i put the order through and BOOM .. LOOKIN GOOD in my sexy jacket lol.. Would mos def get more from them
B00IVEDB8K|4|Would order again just larger size
B0081EMBK4|5|Have had the jacket for about a month. I ordered an XL fits as an XL should fit on me. A slight complaint may be the sleeves are a bit short. The jacket is warm in 30-40 degree weather with moderate wind. The hood is removable (has a zipper). As is the case with most olive colored clothes, the jacket looks brown in medium to low lit rooms. In the end, completely worth 28 dollars I bought it for.
B004FHRPYI|1|I have always bought the more expensive Carnival Front Close Long Line, I thought I would save some money by buying this one and it was a flop, so sorry I did. It was hard to snap on, the back support is not comfortable and the fact that the straps are not adjustable makes my shoulders hurt.  I guess you get what you pay for--- my mistake.
B008HAS8IG|5|Awesome
B00CMVMBDO|3|This shirt is cute but it shed everywhere! I washed it before I wore it and it still shed. I don't think the material is very durable either. I feel like I got what I paid for.
B0043W7RYI|5|These are the most comfortable shorts bar none in a hot climate.  I have been wearing these for years.  I just bought 10 more.
B00PTBPN3O|5|When you get the dress you have to wash it. It smells kind of funny
B00S6734PC|1|To small
B001FQMDRG|2|The color wasn't at all pictured.  The fabric is very thin and form fitting.  I'm afraid that it won't survive being washed.
B00KVCLU60|5|Can't wait till my grand Daughter can use it
B003QYGFVU|5|very very flashy and quality constructed. this coin skirt has quite a bit of weight to it, which is really what you want for belly dance.
B00JJN04MS|5|good quality, soft, not itchy.
B003EI0UHS|5|Perfect
B00G71LQRW|3|this is made for skinny people~ not your average American Sci-fi loving male. I would suggest upsizing.. since it's a poly fiber blend.
B009FV9NQM|3|my daughter was happy with it.
B00005LILM|5|Really like it for the cost.
B007R1OMC2|5|Fits great, looks great and feels really comfortable. Usually I wear a large but after I washed the shirt it fit perfectly.
B00CL0HPZU|5|Very pretty. Pretty colors and attractive design. Very reasonable. Dresses up a plain sweater and looks nice with a coat
B0052T9TB0|5|This dress arrived promptly and is a perfect fit -- our little girl was precious in my brother's wedding!  The quality and colors of the dress are exactly as appears in the photo.
B002QP3K0Y|5|I got these for my Day of the Dead outfit and they're perfect. Not much more to say! I recommend them for a costume type outfit. Currently out of stock (7/6/2012) so not finding them through the link search. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QP3K0Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B008RQZVP8|4|My husband liked them, found that they fit true to size (phew!), and continues to wear them in his underwear rotation.
B00AG3ZILM|4|Cute shirt, comfortable, soft 100% cotton. Very flattering cut.  Reasonable price, too.  I plan to order another 1 or 2.
B0019GNH40|4|Cool shirt.
B00LT2O86K|5|Awesome shirt  warm comfy and stylish yes it's a night shirt but I found myself in a bar at 4am w a pair of the comfy pants (also ralph) and this shirt & let me tell you I looked good and I'm not one to blow my whistle being s dad of 2 girls so enjoy and be flexible 🐼
B00ISQDP1E|5|The suit fits, and is just what I was looking for.
B00DJNSNBI|4|Perfect for what I want- inside the boot and coming out folding over the top.  Just turned it inside out so the tassels hang outside the boot.  Very cute!
B00NGLFIQG|1|Really small...terrible
B0048W5IHQ|5|I LOVE my PJ's!  I bought one for my mom, one for me and one for two of my friends.<br />Super cute and comfy.  The perfect nightshirt.  I am a large 14 plus 185 woman and the shirt fit nicely.<br />I do not think it would be as comfy for someone larger though.  It's not for an XXL person.<br />One size fits all is a myth and only true for smaller people. : )
B00PK9XTP4|5|Would buy again, just as described. Fast shipping.  Love it, Thanks !
B00JPT3072|4|The size chart does say that they run small so when it arrived, it fit as i expected.  Shirt feels good, it's soft and comfy.
B00EDO9GH2|5|I bought it for my Baby Brother who just turned 50. I got a fun text from him telling me he loved it. So you get 5 stars from me.
B004QF0LO0|5|looks very sexy on my wife..love to always see her dressed like this. Bought it for her as a surprise which she appreciated.
B00SG73B4Q|3|These fit small on me despite them being the correct size. Otherwise they're comfortable and I do enjoy wearing them.
B00BFAY85M|2|The jacket looks small for my 12 year old. Plus the hood is way too small for someone that has any amount of hair.
B004WJ2JNG|5|Great product!  Easy to put on, even on a fussy baby.
B00DT4R4KS|5|I ordered these over-sized as I wanted plenty of room. The quality is excellent. Can be warn as is or with under clothing such as jeans or thermals. I have priced similar bibs in my local sporting goods store(s) at twice the price and half of the quality.
B005243Z2Y|5|If you normally wear a 34 x 34 505, 514, etc, you'll NOT want 569 in 34 x 34 since the waist will buckle and fold over.<br />I normally wear a 34 x 34 in the 505, 514, 517, and 527styles but I've found that the &#34;ice cap&#34; 32 x 36 in 569, once washed, shrink to be equivalent to 34 x 34.  These look as great as the heavier weight 514 tumbled rigid but they're so lightweight one can move without any restriction.  Expect a great fit and lots of compliments.  Note that 569 Jaggers, the normal weight denim, do not shrink - and if you like 34 x 34 514's, then purchase 31 x 34 for the best fit.
B005O33LJA|1|I am super disappointed in this shirt.  The collar is stiff and about twice as high as I would expect; it borders on mock-turtleneck. It is very heavy and fits funny.  It is narrow at my shoulders and much longer than I would expect.  That said, my car is grateful to have such nice cleaning rags.  Being heavy, they hold a lot of soapy water and are soft on the paint finish.
B00LKY093I|5|Love these!  Warm and comfortable.
B00KHASZ6O|5|Love it! Same as in picture and is very body hugging. I ordered the pink one and is so pretty! Highly recommend!
B00K31E4JY|5|Despite being longer and a bit larger i love the feel of the fabric and color of my long johns.
B0072JAAYI|5|This wig is one of many wigs i buy online ,and I think it is very nice! but that send me the wrong color and then sending me a new one with right color am very please with the results and how it looks got and nice hair you will enjoy it!!
B008Q40ITU|5|This is exactly what I was looking for!!! Needed skme added support for my curve control this is definitely it! Seriously love this about to order another one asap!
B00PV8QZV4|5|Prompt  shipping, item fits as expected!
B00PH1KSDQ|5|Perfect!
B00B7GWBNU|3|I ordered a 6 but they sent me an 8 which ended up being good because the 6 would have been too small. The fabric is stiff and thin and had a smell, so I've washed it a few times. It's a little better now, but the fabric wrickles really easily. It's fine for summer because it's so thin. The sleeves stick up more than I was hoping, but I wear it with a jacket or cardican and it's fine. Shipped fast.
B00IVYPZQQ|1|These r straight up underwear!
B000XVVB40|5|Always good for elderly mom...
B000FXXW9S|5|My husband wears these overalls every day for everything and they are sturdy and practical.  They fit well and are<br />very well made.
B00I03ER1M|5|I saw this at the long beach aquarium and almost bought it, but of course I had to check Amazon to see if it was cheaper. I'm glad I did because it was $35 down to $10! Anyway, I would have paid $35. It's light and thin but well made. I bought the 12-18 month size for my about average 8 month old and it fits a bit big in the arms but the length is fine. I like loose fitting clothes and this has no stretch. He will be able to wear it for a good two to three months. I would say its more like a 9-12 month fit.
B00E0G2NB4|5|Perfect fit for my little one
B00GNO9HCE|4|This dress is very nice.  I only have two issues and it is not with the dress.  I don't have very wide hips so it is not so flattering like the picture, but that is not the dress.  The other thing is, is the length I am 5' 2'' and the dress falls a little below my knees like the picture.  Since I am so short this is not very complimentary, but it can always be shortened.  Again, these are not really issues with the dress, just a reference for someone similar thinking about buying it.  The dress itself is nicely made.
B00EEAZPF2|4|Would buy again. Perfect
B00SK9EB6M|3|Thin t-shirts and fit a little small compared to other shirts their size, hopefully they don't shrink too much. The lettering is coming off on the men's shirt straight from the box and it hasn't even been washed yet.
B003KG9ZC0|5|I bought this in size 3-6 months for my 4 month old son, and it fits great! There's plenty of room for him to grow even after I washed it, and the material feels incredibly soft and thick for bedtime.  I'll definitely be buying more of these from Little Me.
B0052BQSDK|4|I like my jeans yessir they fit like they were made for my body. Boot cut rocks yessir chicks dig my boot cut.. getcha some jeans
B00JM93MQE|5|Perfect fit for a 12-13 year old boy. Great quality shirt as well.
B0064Y439U|5|These pants are a perfect fit! The big elastic waistband makes them feel very secure and are super slimming. The weight of the fabric is perfect for where I live which is sort of warm. I'll probably order another pair pretty soon, thanks Danskin!
B0018Y269U|5|Good pair of pants for the money.  Can't beat it!!
B00P9XREPC|5|These are great - I have RA and these keep my knuckles warm plus I look very patriotic!  Ever since 9/11 - I have worn Red, White, and Blue every Tuesday (for 14 years).  It was on a Tuesday when the 1st plane hit the towers.  This is my way of showing respect for the folks who lost their lives on that terrible Tuesday and for our Military who go above and beyond.  God Bless America!
B009K1OD30|5|My brother loves it it fits well and serves the purpose the shipping was a little off but the product is as described
B00HVRAPV4|5|I've gotten lots of compliments on this- Super warm, love it!
B001BXZYP6|5|I was pleasantly surprised with this costume. Of course it's not the greatest material. It's a Halloween costume for Pete's sake but I've seen much worse. The size--in my opinion--was exactly as described. I ordered a s (4-6) for my large-ish 3 1/2 year old nephew.<br />It fits loose enough for him to wear clothes beneath--which is required, usually cold where we live.<br />The coloring was true and all the pieces were accounted for.
B00GB9120Q|4|Looks good under clothes. Comfortable. A little bit of a torpedo shape but not too bad under clothes.
B00HHBSSU4|5|It was hard to believe that a garment of this quality was so easily available and at such a reasonable price. Instant sartorial splendor.
B004B4DEL8|4|How is this coat in the rain/wet snow?  Is it water resistant?  It looks nice, but my climate is quite damp.
B008VPS986|5|Great pants,  Great price
B00N39V3EW|5|Gorgeous dress. Exactly as pictured.
B00HG7GEXM|1|it was disconnected and practically no use by the second wear ...not good quality
B00HD7BYX0|5|i love it
B003EDHLTS|5|My husband loves it and it did not look cheap. Looks great on him! I would recommend it! Nice color!
B00880B1XE|5|Belt is just as pictured and discribed.  Haven't had it long but seems to be good elastic and craftsmanship. Wore it over a long sweater and it worked great.
B004SQUDHW|5|Addicting. This underbust came quickly and in great shape made with quality materials and detailed craftsmanship. The shape it produced can't be posted here, but WOW. I will buy another when this one wears out, yet it is tough. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who already visualized this.
B007R0MXME|5|Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it! Plus it came early!  Its so soft and warm! Perfect for winter!
B0007A4MFC|5|[[ASIN:B0007A4MFC Goddess Strapless Satin Formal Gown Prom Dress]]  I ordered this dress for my daughter for prom. The dress came so fast. There were some creases in the dress which is to be expected from being folded nicely in its shipping box. But that is easy to iron out - silk setting w/steam. The dress is beautiful! The pictures don't do it justice. It is such a classy looking gown and for the price, it looks like it really should cost more. All my daughters' friends who have seen it want to trade dresses with her. They all spent over $200.00 for their gowns in town and I think this dress looks way nicer than theirs! I ordered a size up just to be safe. I had to have it altered for my daughter. It was a good thing I went up a size to accommodate my daughters big chest, but the rest of the dress had to be sized down. My daughter loves her dress and she looks beautiful!!
B00NL59JSA|1|Item is EXTREMELY small. It fits really tight and is not baggy look like the pictures show. I feel like I've wasted my money.
B001EJMT82|4|I like Calvin Klein lingerie cause it's pretty comfortable and good-quality.<br />Overall the product is good, I just wish it could look better after a few month of use.
B000CB1MOU|5|This is a very high quality shirt, and has a really good fit. It reminds me of the singer's shirt in concert. Very cool and very durable, excellent embroidery, a must have.
B008YCSDA0|5|This Dickies Men's Shirt came on time and the price was lower than other stores. I other it medium size for my 14 year old teen and fit confortable.
B00CYKP07M|4|Very unique colors and looks good with just some shorts or under an outfit.
B00N3TX35Y|4|Fits well, very warm, only downside is the fleece is about two inches up inside the interior edge of the hat so the acrylic is against the ears and forehead when worn. People with sensitive skin it may be somewhat itchy if your skin is sensitive to acrylic, bought this with the understanding it was lined with fleece as it is much less irritating to the skin.
B00C85G072|4|I was a little concerned about the sizes.  Some said too big or too small.  It seems these dresses vary based on color.  I ordered the black and the material was nice and thick which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I am 5'5&#34; and 140 pounds.  I am curvy but I wanted the dress to fit so I got the small/medium.  It was bigger than I wanted, and kind of had some sagging in the back.  Even with it being a little big it did cling and my thong line did show.  I just ordered the x-small/small for comparison, even if I only get one wear for the price it is worth it.  I will update my review once I receive it.  **Update the x-small/small was a PERFECT FIT! I received many compliments & I will purchase the sleeveless version of this dress soon.
B00NIY1I9M|5|Excellent look and fit.
B00KC0PEPY|5|I am always looking for long sleeve onezies for my grandson. These are of really nice quality, wash up nice and fit him well. He is 7 months old however he is about the size of a12 month old. Colors are true to the picture
B001IAI7LA|5|For the very reasonable price, this topcoat has good material and fine tailoring. It fits very well and my wife has complimented how it looks. The main reason I'm writing, however, is to praise the supplier, Menswear eCollection. Through my own carelessness, I accidentally ordered the wrong size and placed a duplicate order. When both orders arrived, I was travelling and unable to try on the topcoat for more than a month past their published return policy. They generously accepted both returns anyway and sent the single replacement in the right size, very quickly and without any additional expense. They even covered all the shipping costs.<br /><br />I let too much time go by, past the point where I can review the merchant directly - so the only way to honor their generosity and good service is by reviewing the purchase, which I'm doing now. Menswear eCollection went beyond what I could fairly have expected, and I feel the need to let people know.
B00F93E3V0|4|This was purchased for casual use around the house and running of quick errands. I like the quarter-zip feature and the fit (not baggy) and can be worn both tucked in and tail out. Good value for the money.
B00DDSBOVK|4|Good fleece for a great price. But, the fleece has a 1/4 inch orange band in the middle of the collar. You can't really tell from the pictures. Some people like the orange band, some don't.
B0009MKEB4|4|I was looking for a yoga short for the summer. This product meets my expectation. Easy to take wash and dry.
B002NA3OR6|4|The paints are nicely made, comfortable, but way way too long---had to have them altered.<br /><br />But overall--very nice
B00GNO9JZE|4|The dress was too small and I ordered a large 12-14 especially in the hip/bottom area fit fine everywhere else and was long like the picture and I am 5'4.
B00D5OWFRE|5|Thank you so much for the item. It is very nice and it came very well packed. I will recommend you. The item is just right what I wanted.
B00BSHE3LG|5|Fits my husband perfectly which doesn't normally happen because he is 6'3. The stretch material makes them extra comfortable to wear.
B00E8ILOCS|5|I am surprised at how much support this stretchy bra gives. Makes for a smooth back under knit clothing.
B00ZJJ21SQ|5|Can't stop wearing this! Looks adorable under tank tops, dresses, etc. Super comfortable and flattering.
B007WAU1QY|3|The blouse is thicker than i espected, but it's ok. The color is lighter than the picture and I didn't like how the buttons were lined up and they're plastic and not silver like the picture shows. Is a nice blouse for the price,  it looks good wearing it showing a shoulder.
B00946GQBI|5|GREAT deal!  These are well made, soft and well fitting.
B002KB0EXU|1|PICK THE WRONG SIZE.
B00CXXNIIS|2|Too small. No space for charger or USB cord (so I ended up losing them. Great.)<br /><br />And not hard enough for good protection. One of my cameras was damaged in this.<br /><br />FYI: Bought it for Panasonic Lumix
B00CJI9ZI4|5|&#34;My baby blues and you!&#34; Thanks for the review inspiration Barry! Nice fit and feel! Wife went bonkers for the look.  Croota has awesome products and the best online delivery service I have ever experienced
B00MFDUBUO|1|Do not order!  The sizing chart is way off.  They have no clue what a U.S. size is.  I ordered a med/large and I think maybe a 12 year old might could wear it.  Waste of money!
B00HWFA0DS|5|These are comfortable and fit as expected
B00KTGPCSA|3|Sizing chart was quite off. I gave them away.
B00C2VFH08|5|I love this shirt, I read the reviews and knew that it would most likely fit a little larger. I love it. It fits like a dream, and is so comfortable. I took the quiz on Pottermore.com and got sorted into Slytherin, which makes me a little more proud to wear!
B00HIV8YHA|2|very small..I bought other shirts in the same size and have been well, this remained small.
B00GTKZQQI|5|Love love love love it soo much!!!
B00GGX3FF2|5|Great product better then expected. Thought the box will be much nicer
B009PFYRKK|5|I bought this as a gift for my son.  He seems to really enjoy it, especially in the winter time, as I covers most of his face.
B00ACIGVIK|4|Very good price
B006HZFMCI|4|These Bermuda shorts are great for everyday casual wear perfect for the Aussie summer months. They are quite well made and at the price I paid good value.
B00CMWJV9U|4|Good material, a little loose on my skinny daughters legs, but its fine. When they arrive, they smell really strong because of the colour I think, after the first washing totally gone. Would recommend them!
B00C9XV474|5|I bought these for my granddaughter. She works outside as a trail hand and says these are the best pants she has owned for work.  Very comfortable and tough.
B000TGYG28|5|Very comfortable underwear. Very stretchy, and good quality as you'd expect from CK. Was a little snug around the legs, unlike other underwear from the same company. Good thing it's stretchy!
B00466DB5K|1|This looks and feels like a cheap product, but the worst part is that I've worn it a couple of times and is already falling apart.
B00HX0OGLO|1|This dress is garbage, looks nothing like the pictures and very see threw. Don't waste ur money on it.
B008L2J01Y|5|My little one is 4 months, and we've used these since she was a few weeks old.  They have held up nicely and are gentle on her head.  They are wide bands and look cute with a fun bow. Quick delivery as well.
B00B30XBOI|5|They're underwear and they fit like underwear. I bought &#34;nude&#34; to wear under white shorts. White underwear show through white shorts but nude does not.
B00DKSVPKI|1|First of all I am not a very picky person about clothing, but this jacket is just ridiculous. I ordered a blue jacket, and instead I received a jacket that was almost tourquise.They have advised us that the sizes are a little different, so if you needed a medium you needed to order a large, or if you needed a small, order a medium. I was expecting it to be tight since I ordered a medium, but instead actually got a medium sized jacket. That is false advertisement and I do not appreciate that. Also, the jacket is just hideous. The material is cheap looking, and it is the type of material that you would expect to have with a cheap hunting jacket; it litterally sticks to your clothes, and it looks NOTHING like the picture shown.<br /><br />Overall, I am not happy with this jacket, and it is not worth fighting over 40.00 something dollars for. I literally threw away the jacket, and now I am having to spend more time finding another.<br /><br />Please for the sake of your time and money, do not order this jacket or you will be very disappointed.
B001IO3982|5|Gloves fit perfectly!
B00K78UZGE|5|Quality is great but the outfit is too large for my little one .
B00FK8FT5S|3|Very cute jacket which I would give 4 or even 5 stars.  Material is thin and does not really keep you warm.  It does run samll which I should have taken into consideration and took a chance ordering the medium but large would have been more comfy especially is you need to layer.  Other than that, the jacket fit.  I would actually purchase another one but large versus medium. *i usually fit small or medium depending on style
B00A0GGKJ4|5|So, I plan to use this mask to embarrass my children at every opportunity. Whether it's dropping them off at school or answering the door when their friends come over. My mind is racing. This is a year round mask that will probably be handed down to my kids once they have kids of their own to embarrass.<br /><br />It is super stinky, but I followed another reviewer's recommendation and rinsed it with warm water (minus the hair), let it dry in front of a fan, and it was then pretty good.
B00BW9ZUAI|4|This scarf is going to be soooo warm in the winter time.....so big that you can't wear it to dress up a shirt, but would be awesome in snow weather.
B00TDK01J8|2|I wanted to like this. I was looking for a terry cloth bib with snaps, so I tried this out despite the bad reviews. As long as you don't was these, they are great! But with any baby item it HAS to be easily washable because babies are messy! If I line dry these they are ok, but the second they get in the dryer the plastic inside melts into a clump leaving the bib unusable. I lost 3 of these bibs after the first use! I would give them 6 stars if they could figure out how to make them so you can dry them without ruining them!!!!
B00B31RT86|1|Item is not very fluffy.  It is not full like the image.  Purchased a different keychain that was better from amazon.
B000KD6470|5|My 2 year old grandson loves the shirt when he sees me wearing it.  Cannot ask for morre
B00C7N2H18|3|I really like the style and fit of the pants but the quality of them was disappointing. The first day of wearing them there were two holes, one on the pant leg at a seem and the other at the waist band. Other than that they are comfortable and cute.
B005GYFVU4|5|Fit was great, can accommodate a larger or smaller body if you are unsure about size. The cowl doesn't stand up by itself so I'll probably reinforce it with some thin wire, but other than that it was great. Very comfy, I could stay in it all night.
B0017QA98Y|4|cute.  daughter loved it.  ran on the smaller size .
B00F7QG86C|5|Soft, roomy, comfy!  I love the look and feel of this shirt!  The color is true to the picture.  Perfect!
B00GHLMRAW|5|When I came across these scarves I thought they were cute and at that price why not. They delivered way before my expected delivery date and I was pleasantly surprised at how good of quality they are. when ordering things online you tend to not get your hopes up because you never know if you will be actually getting exactly what is pictured I am happy to say with these you get everything you wanted.
B00FX3WQ2O|4|Nice shirt. Too much money. But nice.
B00KT9TBNY|4|Fits well and is very pretty!  Great for my bachelorette party outfit :-)
B008H4A7QS|5|This is my first year in Minnesota and I didnt even know it got this cold in America. This stuff is a life saver!
B00C7FGZHI|5|a very nice frame and my friend likes it a lot...the style is simple but elegant.... it looks quite German
B00IIVX1Q8|5|Outstanding customer service, fast delivery, fast response on product questions, and any issues. We recommend purchasing products from Leggings4u. Beautiful colors/patterns on the fashion leggings.  Perfect fit, we give the product 5 stars. But most of all, it is a company that provides outstanding customer service, with fast delivery. To us this service is worth 10 stars instead of the only 5 stars we can give this company.
B00FYO6U1K|3|Too small and not poofy enough.
B00VP9LR98|2|I ordered an XX and I wear a 14 to 16 U.S. size... But this Dress was drastically too tight too small too little..no form nor fashion was this Dress to be an XX...Maybe ok for the land of the little people. This dress is more like a 5 or 6 Small
B00M9BOLAI|5|Beautiful jeans! Comfortable and very nice fabric and nicely tailor. They arrived three weeks before they the estimated time of arrival!!!
B00OAP79RI|2|Print was cute. But this is small. I wear a 10 in jeans and got the large but this looked disgusting.
B009JW9YQ6|5|We took our kids to Disney and everyone asked where we got this shirt.  So cute!!!!!  All of the princesses just loved my son in his cute mousestache t-shirt!!
B00ID4ROIQ|5|Great Socks! Great  Price! Great  Fit!
B00PZEHVCG|5|Quality product
B005DLUI26|1|Cheap and tore up very easily. Its a hard case to it does the job but the look doesnt stay in tack.
B00L4FUGQS|5|Bought as gift, and they liked them
B00ASGIJ0Y|5|I looked all over in town for Good Training Pants for my granddaughter, Could not find any thick one's.  My Daughter said look on Amazon you will find them! and I sure did.  Thank You  Amazon makes it so easy.
B006V4VDRI|5|Great looks great on a jacket or a hat !!!!!!!
B0031R22NW|4|Good quality product, doesn't stretch or loose fit like some other brands of similar style.  Very comfortable for all day wear.
B00MC1Q25C|5|Really nice THIN wallet!
B0051HFHS2|5|I love them
B0052H0EW0|5|I have always used plastic collar stays. This was a great purchase, I have al the sizes I need and apparently they will last long.
B001RFK9A8|2|lasts a few weeks....
B0054ZF8DK|5|My son was really wanting a tie for some reason.  This one was perfect.  He was so proud to go to school on Valentine's day dressed in a button up with tie and some jeans.  My handsome boy!
B0056JT2EA|5|Nice warm and cozy feeling.  Not to long so you never have to worry about tripping over it.  Easy to wash.  I just love it.
B000X1VLIQ|5|These Big Smith overalls are comfortable and durable.  This was my first pair of Big Smiths and I have been very happy with them.  They have a different design from Libertys, but they include a built-in pocket for my watch, which I really like, and - being as they are made of a slightly lighter denim than some other brands - they are comfortable right out of the box.  They have a generous cut, so they are not too snug around the middle.  Overall, I think these overalls are top-notch.
B009CCRK8C|4|Ankle elastic is not very large and has an absolute limit on how much it will stretch. When it stretches to that limit there is no give at all. If your ankle is a little too big, you are out of luck.
B00FQVVAQG|5|Perfect
B00ITIULL8|4|Purchased as a gift. Pretty.
B00NB921CM|5|Love the shirt. Very cute to wear to baseball games
B00TKIJKAE|5|Very nice and Totally worth it!  Buy and pay no Mind...it's nice. eom
B00OZEFH1O|5|Perfect fit and love the material!
B009TCFLAO|5|These are not only functional but they are adorable. They add a special touch to outfits. They aren't bulky either.
B00422MCW6|5|i gave this to my bf for his bday and he super loved it! love the quality of the leather. soft & smooth & you can put a lot of stuff like cards, pictures and etc
B00OO9C790|4|Bought for my teenage daughter. Fit true. Soft inside...she loves it.
B0055XOBYS|2|Flimsy. Doesn't stay attached. This item has one purpose and can't do it.
B00LCEZKJE|5|Comfortable pajamas that my son loves.
B0072QSR1Y|4|The dress fit nice, the material classy, I'd recommend it to my girl friends and sister, it has an elegant finish
B009EREJ98|5|Very nice!
B00CDZNAS4|5|I purchased several of these shirts in different colors to wear over my tank top while jogging in the morning.  Absolutely perfect for the job!  Colorful enough so that cars can spot my approach, light and airy to let the breeze in and the sweat out, and they are cute!  I am very pleased.
B00BYS4UP8|5|received agnethas wig today<br />it great quality fabulous<br />id recommend these for party piece you will be amazed<br />patricia mc keown
B00HHOXRZC|4|Received many compliments on this style.  The sleeves are a bit snug.  Orolay needs to be considerate of larger women in America.
B00KLFTFGY|5|Great fit
B00MGSOA0K|5|My favorite burp cloths! Super soft and absorbent!
B00HU09FFE|4|While the pants are beautiful they are quite large
B0083I21J4|4|just a bit too small
B00775MMQ6|1|The item was delivered to me damaged,  i think its a cute outfit, didnt expect to pay for a damaged item :-( :-(
B00D3WPANO|5|These are the only shoes my daughter wears.  They stay on her feet and keep them warm!  A must have for babies!
B00KXSMUV6|3|Very soft, light weight and warm. Giving three stars because the stitching in one of the sleeves was botched. I didn't have time to do a return and managed to work out the kink a bit but I still need to adjust that sleeve every time I put it on. If it was not for that issue I would have given 5 stars.
B00AENFW3S|5|Fit perfectly - very comfortable!  I am very pleased.
B004RCS1H6|4|Very cute but not as fluffy as it looks in the picture.<br />It is also a lighter color.
B001F8J9NA|5|I got a lot of laughs during halloween and never fell short of people rubbing me while i hoped to grant their wishes!    Hope you guys enjoy it as much as i did
B006B3K4S8|3|Very cute but the straps are very close to the edge of the shoulders which causes them to slip off. The leg is also high cut. Not very appropriate for a four year old.
B005OKLGB8|5|I bought the jean pants for my daughter, age 10, who refuses to wear jeans.  She needed to wear jeans for a band event with the school.  The small was a bit snug and I probably should've ordered her a medium (worried they would then be too long).  The jean pants are comfortable and look like jeans.
B000NZW3IY|5|Its all true, every word.  I am a skeptic by nature, but I chose to take a gamble on this \\"AMAZING\\" piece of apparel.  When I took it out of the package I began to immediately feel the life changing effects of this shirt.  The women, the fame, the fortune, they all came easily.  Within days of owning this shirt I rose to the top of the rap, rock, country, and gospel charts.  I have thrown 17 complete no hitters in a row.  My latest piece of art just sold for $450,000,000.      I haven't taken the shirt off since.  I purchased a second shirt, and to my amazement, with only minor adjustments I was able to wear it as a pair of shorts.  A third shirt was purchased, custom shoes were the result.  I now have a complete tri-wolf ensemble, and I am close to becoming the worlds first trillionaire.
B00O7UPWHU|2|The fabric is a little transparent.
B0097AZ1SA|5|Beautiful!!
B00DWXK4KI|5|Information about diabetic foods and counting carbs a must read book you will be surprised at what foods are good and foods that will not be good causing sugars levels to spiral
B00PXVU5X8|5|Cute and perfect
B00D8VA9AE|1|Received this item and its color is nothing like that of the picture. I was hoping for a sand colored belt, and what I got is a mousy brown one. This is the second belt I ordered from the Stacy Adams brand, and is the second belt I will be returning to the Stacy Adams brand.
B00K6JHD82|5|Its comfortable and neat
B007C2PZQ8|2|Shrinks!!!!!
B00OQQJ2BW|1|I was really disappointed in these.  Perhaps these are meant for pregnant women, because the stomach is area so large they reach my breast.  If that wasn't bad enough, 5 of the 6 pairs had brown spots in the crotch area where the stitching is (some on both front & back of the crotch).  I had to wash these twice with bleach before it came out (gross).  The leg area fits okay when you first put them on, but then loosens up quickly and becomes baggy.  I will try to cut these down and put a new waistline on them since they were soooo expensive, but will never buy again.
B00NUEDKWI|5|Awesome
B00OANDS1G|3|This product is Jr Sized. I see it now in the title; however, it is not mentioned in the description.  I ordered a size up as suggested, but it was still way too small. This same print is available in other style shirts direct from CafePress. I am planning to return it and purchase one of those. It is a very cute design; hope I can still get in time for a Christmas gift.
B00DQT0VRO|3|I may have read the sizing wrong...in fact I'm sure I read the product description wrong. The Capri Fisherman Pants did not fit me but they are so well made and the material is so good that I gave them away to a skinny person instead of sending them back for a refund.
B0033FLX6O|5|Great support! Love it fast shipping
B00KFPU7HG|3|Comfy, good material, and very cute. The only problem I found is that they stretch once you wash them. They fit perfectly when I first got them, but after their first wash they we sagging off my bum. I advise to order a size down if you face a similar predicament to mine (slim waist and thick thighs).
B0054DXEL0|5|The product is as described and above. My mother love the quality and texture of the pashina. Not a single problem with this seller. Highly recommendable. On time and trusty. Thanks.
B004KNP5IK|4|I really like the Cutter and Buck Drytec pools, they're incredibly durable and very comfortable.  The only negative at all is minor, that they do tend to run on the large size.
B008G7J9D8|5|Love it! Live in it! Great for Utah weather!
B00RDKOPIS|4|I am 5'3&#34;, 175, 38C and ordered a 12. The dress fit almost perfect, except that I would have had to take almost two inches off of each shoulder strap for it fit right in the bust. Probably designed for a larger bust.
B0000CBDQS|3|Okay but not very sturdy
B00IYNSV5Q|5|Very nice shirt. Will buy more in spring.
B00K16T37Y|5|I love this .. And enjoying swimming everyday :)
B008HNJ80U|3|Not bad for the price, but I'd rather pay an extra twenty dollars for better material. If you've ever worn an Express &#34;Modern Fit&#34; shirt, this is more baggy than one of those.
B00B30IZK8|4|I love it, the color was exactly the same like in the picture and it's warm and thick perfect for the winter
B0044VGA7S|2|I guess I have a larger than average head.  Other than being too small this seemed made well for the money, I ordered black and it was black.  That's all.
B007N8G5C4|5|love it
B00KOV06B8|5|I bought it in black but didn't love this color on line, so I waited for it to go on sale.  On my monitor it reads lavender, but it's really a beautiful blue-gray.  So glad I got it!
B00KIE10DO|4|I mean like everyone said you certainly cant expect much since they're so cheap.  I bought like 12 and im okay with a new pair whenever i need. theyre kind of rough in texture though nd they song have very much stretch to them.  but i can deal.
B00S7BUMUC|4|My daughter lice them
B004LCPDBY|5|I bought this t-shirt and many others for my children and they love them all. It has amazing graphic and high quality 100% cotton.
B00OZSJJSW|3|The dress fits me perfectly but the disappointing part is that it was more red then burgundy😌
B007CLI6CO|5|It's a great good quality pants that I have ever had! It's a little thick so I can wear in fall even in winter. It kinda look dandy and I love it!
B001M0MXWA|5|Beautiful shirt for the price!! Fits good. The body is regular cut, so it's not big and poofy. We ordered a size 18.5 and sometimes the shirts can be VERY big to try and overcompensate for the size of the neck. This one is very classy looking. Not too big and not too small.
B00KBZQXGE|5|Top top and top europe this is how a t-shirt must been
B00STV1TTI|5|Quality of the material & color of the t shirt was fantastic!  Shipping was great, arrived on time.<br />Will order from this company again!
B00CV3201Q|4|I recommend always buying a size up with this brand.  With that in mind, the nightshirt fits child and doll nicely and seems to be well-made.
B00ELN35RC|3|Size was small
B00DF6G172|3|I bought these slipper socks to wear over my alpaca socks to protect these expensive socks from wearing out prematurely.  They have gripper bottoms, which I appreciate.  But I find they wear out quickly, but that isn't a surprise for the amount I paid for them. I found that the Snoozies slippers work better for my needs.  They are padded and a studier slipper, but cost more.
B00CLBZLCS|2|This underwear fit very small.  VERY uncomfortable.  I threw them away.  Will not ever again purchase Champion again.
B00B17CEIW|5|Had to take and have alteration done to big!! But fit nice that's why I decided to keep.  When I went back on line small size was out of stock....
B00UB41ZYK|5|Love them...so cute!
B000H8ADWA|4|I think others have complained about the fact that you don't get to select the print - i decided to take my changes and ordered one anyways and i lucked out and got a nice plain black one .  It looks good and is very easy to use, easy to open and close and is very nice and compact.  Having a small umbrella is key for me as I want it in my bag and not think about is it going to rain while I'm out on a walk and this works great for that purpose. If it's already raining when I leave the house I usually grab a bigger umbrella as those are still better in real rain but its nice to have this one in my bag (or I have one in my purse too) for unexpected rain.  It works great to get you home or get you to the car and stay mostly dry.
B00NDVGH82|4|Because I am 5'6&#34;, I always order XL when it comes to clothing from Asia.  Otherwise the arms are always too short.  So the coat is a little big around, but I expected that.  What I didn't expect was how much it would stink of a &#34;gasoline-like&#34; dye smell on the coat.  I've hung it outside for 2 days, as well as in my bathroom, and the smell has only lessened slightly.  It's a darling dress coat, perfect for dressier outfits.  I hope the stinky smell eventually goes away.  I did wear it the other night.  My husband kept joking w/ me about it smelling like gasoline.
B0009MZY8W|5|I bought these for my husband who wears steel toes and stands most of the day. He complains of his heels hurting so I was hoping he'd get some relief. After the first day, he came home and told me how great his feet felt and what a difference the socks made!  The socks do say for longer life, wash with fabric softener, but I don't use fabric softener, so I guess I'll see how that works out.
B006ZZAC20|1|need to return. it just didn't fit well
B014I5VF6U|5|High quality T shirt, quick shipping.
B006Y3RVOU|3|This is the perfect pin for me - I work in a library.  Great design but the books fell off the pin and I had to superglue it back on.  Now it's on tight!
B005ETYAX0|5|Easier to use than loctite. More rubbery when applied. Great stuff to use when mounting a scope
B003ILJS8S|5|My college daughter asked for winter leggings for Christmas, so I gave her these, she said they worked well.  :)
B00N20P9MY|5|Best value for your feet...<br />Very cool, soft and extremely comfortable.<br />Happy feet = happy socks
B00B7O7970|1|Way too small...I ordered two sizes larger than I normally wear do to others reviews and still was too small! Very disappointing!
B005YVIZLQ|4|I love this sarong though I actually plan to wear it as a scarf. The texture, cut and flow of this is perfect & complemets my clothing very nicely. My only issue is that this had a run in it when I opened the package : (  I am considering returning it but I love it so much I might just deal with it.
B00DZPEFTY|5|very comfortable
B00CBPIQBC|5|Just as described! Bought a size 7/8 for my daughter who wears a size 8 and it fits perfectly! Well-made and fluffy enough to wear with a costume or casually. A good buy!
B00AVZRSCC|5|love it ! Great looking. Got many compliments the very first day I wore it. fast ship thanks A++++ Seller
B00AK9KULK|1|I purchased & just received this outfit and this one as well:  [[ASIN:B00AK9KULK Carter's Watch the Wear Baby-Girls Infant 2 Piece Flower Tunic With Zebra Leggings]]<br /><br />The outfits DID arrive faster than anticipated.  But I'm not happy with the amount of loose threads and gems on the garments.  If the gems are loose upon opening the package, imagine what will happen when my child wears them!  The gems are definitely a choking hazard.  I will be washing them, cutting the many loose threads, & removing the gems.  Don't be fooled:  Carter's brand is different from the Carter's \\"Watch the Wear\\" brand.  I expected better quality.  I will not be purchasing Carter's \\"Watch the Wear\\" products in the future.
B00K036KVU|5|I am an African American female, size 16, small on the top with large hips.  This dress fits perfectly.  The top is snug enough to hold and flexible to expand.  The skirt part fits with plenty of room, not a snug fit at all.  I am short 5'2' and the dress came to the floor with flats.  If you are a tall person this will not be a maxi to the ground.  The quality is good and fabric is lightweight. Shipment was fast.
B00IUG66O0|4|These are super cute and fun! They do have some stretch to them but I would order a size bigger than you are. They arrived well before the expected date, which was a pleasant surprise. They are definite attention getters!I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
B008G6G4VE|4|I am 6'6&#34; and normally wear a 32&#34;W x 36&#34;L. If you are tall, you'll know that clothes hardly ever look the same on you, as they do on these short/average height models they always use for the product pictures. But in this case, the picture in the description actually is pretty close to what you can expect.<br /><br />Ever since Levi's discontinued their Work Wear cargo pants in favor of amping up production on skinny jean metrosexual pants for hipsters, I have been on a search for the perfect pants. These aren't entirely it, but they are 90-95% there. For one, I found them to be comfortable right out of the bag, that's a good start. Not too tight around the hips, or too baggy, and with decent ball space.<br /><br />I live in the tropics, and feel the thickness of these pants are a good compromise between light weight, and durability, even with the double reinforced fronts. The button and zipper are large and sturdy, the front slash pockets are roomy, and overall the pants appear well made. The pant legs will fit over boots as claimed. But as a personal preference, I wish the leg openings were perhaps 20-21&#34; rather than 19&#34;, simply to refine the look for taller folks. Aside from a greater range of colors, that is really the only major thing I would change about these Carhartts. Either way, buy with confidence.
B00KQ16CB4|5|comfortable, like all fox clothing, and quality. Fits great.
B003KQ696A|5|thanks
B00T94YUSG|5|Great product! Used them for years...delivered on time as promised.
B00H4HM0IM|4|Nice....😉👍
B00FBD2G1C|5|reasonable price.
B004LRO45K|5|Don't be afraid to buy this if you're heavy.  I'm 5'6'' and 173lbs and it fit well and flattered me.  Everyone loved it.  It's the staple of my evening/kink wear.
B006SFRMPM|2|I alsp ordered this shirt in the blue and the 2 colors are 2 different materials. Whereas the blue is a nice silky feel, the black is an uncomfortable cotton, not as I had expected, had to return it unfortunately.
B005OFLSF2|5|These Briefs fit me very well, probably the best among all the brands I tried.  The cotton fabric is of good quality-- it doesn't expand and stretch on washing. This is very desirable in keeping the size and shape on repeated washes.
B000IG9BR4|5|Great hoodie, comfortable, but it did shrink QUITE A BIT when i washed it, so beware.
B00CF3Y7KY|5|the items is amazing perfect  cool i love it thank you very much i will give 5 star for that thanks , thank you very much
B00AT0N5RG|5|Haha I bought this product and liked it very much! But they sent me 2 XD so i got more for my money I guess!
B00374HRXE|5|Love this skirt so much!
B00579T9XI|5|As described and a quality purchase
B00F4SDWA8|3|ok
B00HB85EJG|4|neat !
B00VGTR18S|4|Very cute, lightweight maxi.<br />I really like this maxi as the perfect lounger.  It's very lightweight & comfortable.  I just wish the pattern lined up better.
B00BR4NV54|4|It's totally soft and cushy, but runs big. Even big-boobed women will find that the cover-up slips down. I got it to wear around the house, which I do, but I'm constantly having to pull it up. On the upside...my husband likes that it slips down a bit throughout the day.
B00LNK4QJW|3|Really nice t-shirt. It looks good on but cant't wear like a mini dress as it's to short.
B002QRCMTW|5|Works, My go to travel belt as it does not set off airport scanners
B00IYP7MOU|5|My 7 year old daughter loves this produce and she is always getting compliments on it when she wears it.
B0043RJQ8I|4|It runs a little small so order next size up, it didn't shrink for me so thats good. she loves it.
B00FTGBOHS|5|I really enjoy the way they fit..
B00EOA8SLU|5|It was a little longer than I expected but that is an easy fix.
B0041LQHQU|4|Legs a little long.  The hat needs more help.
B00KHTGN5U|4|GOOD PRODUCT
B00SDTQ6PS|5|Great fit and it seems to be of nice quality.
B00TJ07I2U|4|Loved this suit! High waisted black bottoms are hard to come by!! It's a great buy! The top is too small for me but it was worth it for the price and the bottom! :)
B00FKA9RQI|5|This bra fits perfectly, is easy to put on and gives excellent support.  I love it, and I no longer have to get it off asap after a long day.  It's that comfort. ...really.
B00QBISNC2|3|Sleeve is a little long.
B007CFJXPE|5|I love this kind, they are comfortable, look and feel good.
B00D8820ZY|5|The gloves are beatiful and is the perfect fit
B004URK9N2|5|love it
B00I2YSQJI|5|Great
B00B1TO082|3|DRESS IS MADE OF FLIMSY KNIT MATIERIEL, SHOWS EVERY LUMP AND BUMP, EITHER POSSESS A LUMP AND BUMP FREE BODY OR INVEST IN SOME SERIOUS SHAPEWEAR.
B000V7X7Y8|3|I was about to buy these until I noticed that the S&H was almost EQUAL to the actually price of these. A costume accessory that was supposed to be less than $20 is now over $30... Not worth it for some pastic chains I'll use a couple times.    Chains: $17.99   S&H: $15 for standard
B003AXVUI0|3|Satisfied but needed to be a little creative :<br />It's a little small and because it opens a lot in the front I can't wear it as a dress. I wear it with short pants (capri) and a camisole and it looks great. The fabric is very thin so it's fresh in the summer - but it looks less classy than I thought.<br />All in all, not my favourite but found a nice way to wear it.
B00FOSEUKE|5|Great quality and fit
B00I5FP1QK|5|It's great. Better than expected. Good design.
B00LN1KGLI|5|Cool and colorful
B00KAH2LIC|5|Excellent
B0088EYPJM|5|GREAT WALLET... LOOKS AND FEELS WONDERFUL.... AND THE CARD SLOTS ARE PERFECT FOR YOUR  CREDIT CARDS & IDS....  PLENTY OF ROOM AND VERY USER FRIENDLY!  TOM  WALERBORO, SC
B0049TPAQW|4|Great legging tights to keep you warm and cozy during cold days. The fit is great and not so expensive.
B00GASR0KO|5|A little bit large for me.  I am 5' tall, and skinny, so, the S size for me is still large.  The top however is great, nice design, nice fabric.
B002GCY1SM|5|When I ordered this I knew that many people had received theirs with the center lines not matching up to the rest of the lines. You can only imagine how happy I was to see that my mask arrived with the lines matching up perfectly.<br />Over all it's a really good quality mask. Visibility is good, it's very breathable, Probably my only problem with this mask is that it arrived a day late. Overall I'd highly recommend this mask.
B00LVPD1WM|4|it is not so warm I espected but it is ok
B00CEH25UK|2|need larger pair will order up a size next time.
B00J2U133M|5|I originally purchased this dress as a cover up, but it is way too cute for that.  I can't wait to wear it.
B00IXLM9DY|5|Nice shorts. Good quality
B003S8INVY|4|As advertised, washed up soft, good deal.
B00D132EZW|5|pretty cool little stick! love dirt bikes i was glad to find a heart shaped chain stick for such a good price fast shipping and easy to apply!!
B00P84JHJ8|4|Like the hat. It fits well.
B00KCRCAFE|4|Good quality
B00FAGNYWA|3|These are like booties. Nice for around the house. Too small will return for larger size.
B00KTSGUS4|5|Huf socks are always awsome
B00DHH8U8C|1|doesn't fit. the iron inside hurts. I wore once and then threw away.
B00B7KXTAA|2|Too short and too thin. My search was for a heavier material and longer legs. not good not  good crap!
B00BB7FHAE|5|I love these pants!  And they match the Jones T-shirt I got on sale at a local department store here in FL!
B00NF3PHJ8|1|The shirt it's self is very nice, but the decal has cracked and lifted at the rdges after 1 wash and it was on cold inside out and hung up to dry. Very disappointed.
B006QJEZIM|2|Great color but the fit was really off and it was really long, like short dress kind of long. I would recommend another purchase.
B00W3B3ME0|5|Awesome. Made me feel like the princess of Wales it matched the color of my dress perfectly Received a ton of compliments!!
B000MOZDGA|2|I have purchased these in store and again online hoping there was just an issue with the first pack but it wasn't...there is a manufacturing issue with the stitching at the left side of the waistband. U have had to sew each pair and wont purchase them again
B0050SPOHQ|5|As before also like the model, it was a little smaller than I spected, but it's ok, I like it any way it match my back pack
B00DE0RY5C|2|If you don't have 24&#34; arms, don't get this tshirt. It does not fit well. But printing is good.
B00GQZPUCG|3|If you don't have a wide foot these are probably okay but they are a little snug.
B00L3XUSTG|5|I listened to the other reviewers and ordered a size up and it fits perfectly, not even a gap at the bust and yet the waist is still cut in. The label says to dry clean or hand wash, but I sent it to my laundromat anyway and asked them to wash the non-whites in cold water and the shirt was absolutely fine. I'm going to order a couple more colors.
B008ZYCV28|5|Having the best luck shopping off of Amazon, this corset is amazing!<br /><br />Fits like a glove and looks amazing. Solid/stiff build which makes for a really great shape. Laces on the back make it easy to adjust to your body type.<br /><br />This definitely doesn't seem to run as small as people say. I would suggest sizing just one up your regular size. I ordered a M (as a 34-26-36B) and it fit perfectly (the back has a small opening so you can see the laces cross which I like). Obviously if you want the back completely closed, THEN you might want to size up.
B00JFSHJH0|5|Very nice and beautiful dress! Love it!!!
B00KXA4W5Q|4|looks a little cheap but fits well I will see when I wash it
B00E0KIF08|4|I love this skirt but it is a little too big. I just went with medium to be safe but small would have fit. Regardless I love it because the style and material its made of.
B009WNWI74|4|very nice jacket, lined with fur. Keep you warm in the winter.
B00D840A8C|5|It is good.
B000A821N6|1|Like another reviewer mentioned...this costume is not sized appropriately.  I ordered a medium for my size 6-8 build.  Lengthwise the skirt was good--hit just at my knees.  Waist wise it was huge.  I could pull it 7 inches from my waist.  The shirt was way too small.  I don't think a large would have even fit me.  If I lifted my arms just a few inches, my stomach was showing. Amazon was great with the return.
B002HEX1YE|4|I ordered my normal 32 length, but the crouch was so low that leg length was dragging the ground. Otherwise quality of the pant was good.
B00D3WPALQ|5|These were the 4th pair of Zutano Booties I purchased.  They are wonderful.  They don't fall off my daughter's little feet (and once she got a little older, they couldn't be pulled off!).  We used them throughout the winter and spring.  I've purchased a pair for 3 different expecting women.  They might seem a little expensive, but I like to think of them as SHOES -- baby can wear them multiple times (with socks underneath) before they need to be washed.  Great quality, great buy!
B00ARDCESQ|3|Cute but definitely NOT for infants!
B003JEFBC6|5|My daughter has THICK hair and can whip up her hair in a bun on the way to dance.  We love these and have stocked up on them!
B00HYPBPEY|2|There is a lot more decorations to this top than I thought besides just the lace flowers. There also separate flowers on the collar with pearls in each one which is a bit too much for me. I got a large and the torso was too small and the sleeves are too short.
B00O4CWIPK|1|The PJs were super cute. However I ordered a 4t and was sent a 3t but didnt have time to send them back. They fit my son now but in a month or two they will be too small, which is why I ordered a 4t! They were for him to wear Christmas Eve and they shipped a few days before so I just kept them. You would've had 5 stars from me if I was sent the size I ordered.😞
B007JOO164|5|This dress is beautiful...the fit through the hips was great only top was too large just a few alterations...but a great look
B00E0WMP2U|5|GREAT PRODUCT<br />MANY EXCELLENT COMMENTS
B007QB4NOK|1|I'm a size 10/12 woman, about 5 feet tall, and have a B cup chest.  This bra didn't push me up in any discernible way, although the padding slightly enhanced my size when compared to an unlined bra.  The cups were entirely too far apart for me, and I think the center gore needs to be significantly stronger in order to successfully enhance your cleavage.  This wore exactly like any other bra for me, which was fine enough, but not what I was looking for when I purchased this.<br /><br />I'll be returning mine, because I found the back closure to be incredibly uncomfortable.  I could feel the hooks digging into me the entire time I was wearing it.  It's attractive enough, I guess, but that wasn't reason enough for me to keep it.
B0043TYPQE|5|Great socks for hiking .
B007UT4YKQ|4|For the price, these are great jeggings.  They fit well and are comfortable.
B00FJ5LI3O|1|Nice design however one hinge broke,even though I had not filled the card slots and little currency stored. I have had this product approx 4 weeks.
B00H40BGYI|5|Great boxers!!!
B0048KUEK4|5|Great value, great fit, very easy to wear for long periods of time, cups hold me in, but push me up too...  all in all a winner!!!!
B004FGMYHM|5|We have four of these.  They fit well and do the job!
B002O8TD5O|3|Wig was good qualiity. The style was quite smashed when I took it out of the bag. Even though I shook it out it never looked like the picture. I wasn't able to use it. Very disappointing.
B005VDVQ2W|1|This product came
B00FIB15W8|5|This was a hit for my granddaughter.  She wears it all the time.  The quality was good and it washes well.
B008LE0V9W|5|I got these for my girl, & she loves them. I like that they look really good on her...& even better on the floor  lol. Definitely beats the flannel pajama pants
B004ALNS0E|5|This coat fit as expected.  I bought it for my 13 year old grandson and he loved it.  It is very warm and comfortable.
B007KF1U84|5|Love these socks! Wish I found them sooner. Super soft & comfy. Fit great & wash well. Will be buying more.
B008YMEVYW|4|I love that it's vegan-friendly and it looks nice, but the hole in the buckle for the belt to go through is kind of tight so it's a bit difficult to put on. I hope the holes stand up to wear of putting the pin in and out for years.
B0036SUXAK|5|My FIRST half bra and I'm IMPRESSED!
B005U30372|1|This item is very likely a fake.  I have never seen this style button among historical collections.  If you look at the rim underneath it most like will say \\"A O 1972\\"  American Originals 1972. Also, Kleenex had a promotional campaign at that time with reproductions of campaign buttons.
B000MXQ2AW|5|Comfortable, nice pair of slacks, fit was right on, wore well, washed and dried well.  Hang them straight from the dryer, no ironing needed.
B00K0C87US|5|good
B0007OW5J8|5|I bought this belt (Brown) on Amazon.  I am pretty impressed with it.  It goes well with jeans and Khakis.  The finish of the buckle and grains on the brown the belt are the work of a master designer.  A cool belt to buy.
B00JSQHV0E|5|I recommend it. It's not hot and the fabric is good.
B00QC16924|5|This dress is beautiful and is made in great quality. The seller contacted me to verify the measures according to the size chart. Definitely I will by again from them
B002JLRJSY|4|Very good product, good quality. It really slims your body. You can feel the pressure. I wore for 8 hrs and didnt bother me.
B00C2L9MQI|5|Bought for my adult son and he thought they were a little short in the crotch area but I think they are short waist pants and all in all he liked the sturdy fabric that will fit his needs as a work pant.
B008469PM6|5|I love this dress. After reading numerous reviews on this website and listening to the wonderful experiences most of the women on here had described, I knew I had to try it for myself. Ladies to get straight to the point this dress fits perfectly I'm a size 12 I ordered the medium and it fits me perfectly. I traveled to Gatlinburg Tennessee and it was almost 90+ degrees and I stayed cool and comfortable in this dress. Word of caution the material tends to get a static cling feel to it. To resolve the issue, I simply put the dress inside of a pillowcase with a fabric softener sheet and let it dry on a low setting for five minutes and the static issue was gone. I hope this review helps.
B00J5KZ6FK|5|i love it
B00IHM6YGC|4|I read some reviews and knew that it would run a bit smaller so I got large instead of medium. The large fits great. I love to run and although this creates a bit of a uniboob I am OK with it. I just hate the bounce which is minimized with this bra. If you look for a bra to run in, this one is great for the money.
B004FS4KWW|5|product arrived super fast although i paid standard, its really nice to have since the 2 piece sets just dont cover everything and sunscreen is such a pain. it even has a collared neck to protect and goes to about 1 inch to 2inch  below elbows and knees.very pretty and very high quality very happy with this product!!!!
B00NRJVTRO|5|I was hoping to put this cute beanie on my two-year-old, and it fit perfectly. It looks like he will probably still fit into it when he is three. I like that the beard portion can be removed with two simple buttons, one on either side, so if your toddler is resistant to wearing the beard initially, you at least still have a cute hat to wear. This makes for great hipster family photos, and the yarn is soft and not scratchy at all. I received a sample for review, but the opinion is my own.
B00CKIH5CG|5|Attractive socks that stay on her feet, and seems to be well made, able to last until the next kid needs them.
B001FFIT0W|5|I was given a pair of these tights several years ago by my sister.  I just bought another pair because they are comfortable and have held up and I have never had them run.  I purchased the size B and I am 5'7&#34; and about 125 lbs.  I don't ever find myself having to tug at them to pull them up so the fit is really great for me.  The reversible colors are brown and black and I wear them both. I didn't think I would wear the brown often but I find that it really looks great with my brown boots. I hand wash them after each wearing and hang to dry.
B00U5T48F4|3|This skirt is beautiful but it is so smal that it fits for them ho use s-m....
B00OEZERIS|3|I know I'm short but these were still much longer than my other palazzo pants.  Still extremely comforatable though.
B009GJ298M|5|Well made
B00GB7SGSY|5|These jeans are everything I expected a pair of Levi's to be.  Classic look.  Feels very durable. Decent price.  These jeans were a tad tight to begin with, but stretched perfectly in short order.
B001CP1LLY|4|My father-in-law is an avid fisherman. We purchased this for him as a fathers day gift. Fits well, good quality. Shipping took a day longer than I would have liked, however it was still within the estimated shipping quote.
B001G6GJ02|4|it dosent make saence that you have to fill out a review to give it a rating. its fair price and fits well.
B00422MCW6|5|good
B001FOR2CY|5|Great belt! Puts up with all the crazy running around and bending/squatting I do all day. Hard to find a better belt.
B00HFW90W0|3|these jeans fit true to size if knowing this i would had purchased a size bigger in the waist
B007R1EJ5C|5|I purchased this for my husband initially, and unfortunately it was too small for him but it fits me just fine. He is an XXL and I usually wear a L/XL. The hoodie seems more &#34;fitted&#34; as if it was made more for a woman than a man. If you're buying for a man I would go up a size or two. The quality of this hoodie is wonderful. It's so soft, not too thick and not too thin. It's just right. I appreciate the fact that it's made from recycled materials as well. That's probably what gives the material it's softness. Overall I'd say it's great, just made more for a woman in my opinion! :)
B00C1YCH2M|4|Looks great
B005XZIE28|5|just fine
B000XP0FDY|5|The jacket arrived today and was exactly as described in the reviews.  It fits like it was custom made for me!  The leather is incredibily soft and supple.  I am thrilled with the purchase!
B0006IXEA4|5|This feels great, I love the wide straps.
B001TYJDAO|5|Great shirt design. Saw it on a trip we were on and was excited to find it online. I've added it to my collection of Dead shirts.
B00243FULA|5|Expensive looking for a great price
B009L5Y2PY|1|Just not impressed with this blouse. In all fairness, I have not tried to return it for a smaller size and probably should do that. But the one that was sent, does not fit like I thought it would.
B00BS9ED8C|5|The scarf is true to color.  It goes well with blacks, greys, whites, pinks, and denim very well.  It is the perfect scarf for a spring summer and fall wardrobe due to it being so light.
B00B67E39A|5|I love this top, it fits perfect and the material is great. I am satisfied with this purchased. thank u
B006E5PNAC|5|We are very pleased with this robe.  Fits our 2 year old perfect.  Well made, nice terry cloth.  Fits him great.  This is a great buy for the money.  Could not be any happier
B00N4UDDOS|4|Love! Great color.  No tag so never sure which side is front or back.
B00HIAA1ZY|4|The pleating in the skirt was flattened by packaging so it sticks out and looks larger than the photo. Maybe a goof wash will fix it. Other wise very nice and cute for summer wear.
B00P5S7AAK|5|Love, Love .. LOVE this scarf!  Not only does are the colors nice and bright, the material is silky soft.<br /><br />An added bonus ... The color combo is a perfect match to wear in support of my favorite basketball team!!
B00J0QD6A6|5|Good
B00DW4LKR8|5|Best wallet I've ever owned. Super thin and very durable. I've had mine for over 2 years and it still looks like new. Bought this one as a gift for my son.
B002SBDLLE|4|My grandson loves this hoodie.  Only thing is that when you zip it the hood is very tight on the head.
B00B5UDV1E|3|3 stars for the knockoff, 5 stars for NuBra<br /><br />I'm a 34D, after reading the reviews I thought I needed DD, but it's actually too big, so I ordered a D. I thought I was going to receive the same product, but it turns out to be a knockoff brand called FreeBra.<br /><br />The knockoff brand does come with a pretty case, that's going to be useful when traveling, however the bra itself is very cheaply made. (You can tell from the comparison photos)<br /><br />My friend ordered size C and she received the knockoff as well. (The pink case) Both of our knockoff bras look dirty out of the case.<br /><br />So for your reference, when you are ordering, make sure it's sold by Amazon not other sellers, ie. Topgreen.<br /><br />On the photo, from left to right:<br />Knockoff FreeBra with pink case (size C)<br />Knockoff FreeBra with leopard case (size D)<br />NuBra in original packaging no case (size DD)
B00OTCOG6Y|5|nice shirt.
B0007CKMHM|5|I had an old pair of these and ordered some more. The price was great and they fit perfectly. Amazon is great when you know what you want and I find the reviews to be extremely helpful when I'm shopping.
B005ZBGRQK|5|Great fit.
B00LUIITR2|5|Perfect henley!
B00KWZ8VLS|2|I wasn't expecting an expensive belt at this price but I was expecting a belt that would stay intact for at least a couple wearings.  Nope.  The bow is just glued on so as soon as you stretch the belt, the glue starts coming undone so that I was afraid to wear it, expecting the bow to drop off at any minute.  I threw it in the trash.  Also, the bow is quite big and took up my entire waist making me look like a gaudy Christmas present.  The size might not be an issue for everyone though, I'm a petite person - 34-26-34.  The waist did fit me good which was the only thing I was happy about.  A lot of times these types of belts are too big on me.
B00N6SLFFC|5|Beautiful dress! Very girly, good quality! Mu friends loved it. I'm planning to buy some more!
B00N17AACM|2|Material very cheap feeling and itchy.
B00HQDJ3BQ|4|Great quality and really cute!
B00ENWJTEO|5|Very comfortable, soft fabric, I was concerned about the size but they fit perfectly! Im 5'4 and about 125lb. MUST BUY! I will definitely be getting more of these.
B00BG9Q3FK|5|I LOVE these bras. I have every color and I'm praying they make one in white (or patterns!) to complete the collection. It is very rare for me to find good, pretty bras - I have a D to DD cup - and it's super rare to find them unlined. These have enough support for me while being delicate enough to peek through sheer blouses/tops. LOVE. PLEASE make more…. PLEEEEASE!
B005UFME8G|5|Bought this as part of my costume for a  play and it was a huge hit!! I love it - easy on/easy off and gives ya that &#34;pop&#34; of color!
B00SSZYIVQ|5|Quality product, quick shipping!
B003DHSE7I|3|It feels nice enough, but there's no way on earth that it would ever tie in front the way it is in the picture.  I will barely be able to toss it across the front and have it cover the other shoulder, so it will be very limited in its use now.
B00AMX0CZ8|4|Nice tie, the liner makes this particular one a little hard to tie, but once it is done it looks nice.
B00OWXZL3W|2|Nice looking shirt but even the XL fit like an M. I wear an L so it was unwearable. Too bad.
B00JMKCL0G|4|The sleeves were a little short and tight for my taste, but overall pretty good fit. And I love the design.
B00797DK9U|5|I have been enjoying my product thus far. I use it while working out and the results have been great. I like the fact that is has three sets of hooks as it allows for easy adjustment throughout the weight-loss process. I'm 5'8&#34; and wear between an 8-10 so the large was a perfect fit for the mid section.
B00JZTCR94|5|Simple alteration for leg leg was all that was needed. General fit and appearance are great.
B00KBXUN3U|5|AAAA++++++
B00ASL3UUI|4|Very nice trench. I am glad I order
B007L6OOPI|5|i love these. you want to know why? of course, that's why you are here. i bought these exclusively for hot yoga and invariably to wear when i am lazy and don't want to put on real clothes.  i know what you are thinking, that these are entirely too provocative.  i was once convinced i'd be satisfied with yoga pants too. until i took a class at 100 degrees and was slipping around in my sweat and emerged completely soaked. then i was on a mission to find the least amount of clothes possible to wear that would still be comfortable, appropriate, functional, and stylish (enough).  i have purchased other yoga shorts, and they are often REALLY short.  i am 5'9&#34; and 145, which makes this even more of an issue.  these are the PERFECT length.  they are also a little longer in the back so that they don't ride up and provide the perfect amount of coverage - awesome.  they are a great balance of being tight enough so that they don't move around or become baggy (i HATE that) nor do they cut off my leg or torso to cause the sausage look.  i ordered the medium and that suits me perfect.  it fits me like the model in the pictures featured. the material is a little thinner than other yoga shorts, but not see through. so also a bonus as more breathable. only could be negative if ends up wearing/tearing sooner than expected.  probably will have to buy out the entire inventory!
B00L7MRUI0|4|Sexy and cute colors but they are a bit small. Ok for short duration wear but not everyday /all day.
B00519KJYM|5|Sesame Street Elmo Red T-Shirt - 2T, my grandson loved this shirt, good quality and really cute on him. very pleased
B00G31QD3S|5|Great shirt, Great price
B0094FRY7O|5|This is a great robe and was sold at a great price. Mine was a gift for my father. He is very happy this the robe.
B008FB9YRQ|4|My son liked them.
B0013XWDEE|5|Perfect
B008R6TNB6|4|Mid- length boxers are comfortable and do their job. Price is right only wish they also came in white.<br />One more word needed for review
B00L5GACI8|5|I am 5'8&#34; and 160 lbs.  The fit of the large was almost perfect.  The leg holes are a little tight, but I am sure they will loosen over time.  The quality is exceptional for being less than $12!! I think I may order another style.  :)
B00ROSD91I|5|Its great reklss life
B00F2ZX51O|5|Beautiful color, awesome price, fits wonderfully.
B00CONNILE|5|immediately improved my shape.  wore it for 10 hours on day 1 and when i took it off, my stomach was flatter than it's ever been.<br />and, of course, the shape it gives you while wearing it is ultra feminine.<br />always wear a tank top or camisole underneath it, though.  that latex lining inside will feel like it's rubbing your skin raw, if you don't.
B00GBVQDBC|5|received as ordered and more than met my expectations
B008H4HW9S|5|Perfectly nice jeans with a very nice price!
B0010Z9RGC|5|My mom is a diabetic with alzheimers and these socks are the only ones that we have not had to cut at the top to keep from leaving a mark on her leg.
B003ZW83EU|5|Love cotton t's!
B00HB2S3PY|5|My 6 year old son is using this for the second summer in a row.  It is very good quality.  He wore it swimming every other day in summer camp last year and is wearing it again this year.  It has held up very well.
B004GYW1PI|5|My 29 yr old kid suggested these for me when I wanted something more comfortable than earbuds to listen to music.  He knows everything about comfort and music....so I listened to him.  Love the color selection@
B00BUBWZU6|5|Very comfortable.  I bought it because I wanted a night gown that took up little space in my Carry-on bag for my trip. It's very attractive spacious and comfortable. It measures 72 inches around under the arms.
B00BJLE12W|4|Good rain jacket at a good price. It fits well and keeps me dry. What more can I ask ? I would compare it to an  L.L. Bean jacket at a much higher price.
B007CL5IE8|5|Perfect fit. On time.
B007OX42QE|4|These were a gift for my boyfriend. Took a risk ordering these without him trying them on, but they fit well. Great, breathable fabric. Fabric is as pictured but has a muted grayish stripe as well. Still very nice! I recommend!
B002OEBDLK|5|This raincoat is so cute. It can be seen from afar so its nice for safety. It is light weight so its nice for putting over sweaters or sweatshirts. My neice loves it and can't wait for it to rain.
B00CPZ2G5U|5|I am always getting compliments on this hoodie. It fits nice, it's comfortable, it's warm. I absolutely love this purchase.
B000QG6QNI|5|The best stockings ever.  One pair will last you many many wears - I usually get 7 or so wears with no runs and the stockings making my legs look great!
B004LTDDQE|3|This fits pretty true to size.  It has lot's of support!  It is a little pricy but I don't mind paying if the support lasts.  It is really hard to find a full figure bra that doesn't look like a tube.
B008RWBXZE|4|Warm and good quality. A good looking and versatile jacket that's fine on the slopes or at a bar, or commuting to work. This replaced a North Face Denali jacket that was lost--that was softer, whereas the windproof nature of this jacket makes it stiffer. But it's also more structured and warmer, slightly less casual.
B0089BOO2W|3|This t-shirt is super cute, but it's not the same quality as the blue one which is super soft.  It also was a tighter fit, I would order a size up.
B00G3PZDYE|4|The tights looks exactly like the picture, which is awesome.<br />The black part of the tights was very smooth and nice and thick...but the beige part of it is very fragile and looks like it'll snag easily if you don't take care of it properly. It's also kind of small. I'm only 5'1&#34; but I had to stretch it a lot to fit...so I'm scared of snagging the beige part. Fits perfectly and looks super cute though! Awesome!
B010RX1K94|2|Too small, I am very sad, because those are nice and cute
B00R9DSHJW|5|I love it!
B002JAQ1M0|5|I bought the shirt to wear with a suit in the summer. It is better made than the picture shows and fits well.
B0002TOZ1O|5|these are the best socks ever.<br />They last forever.<br />Very durable<br />I love my Gold Toe Socks...<br />Get your man some good socks.
B00BLYSBXM|3|Beautiful BUT what was described as white is actually ivory...fine for some but I look terrible in that color.  The rayon fabric is nice.  I bought it in black and love it.
B00804BQKQ|4|First, kudos to Amazon for their shipping. I received the package ahead of its scheduled delivery date! Then, when I I opened the Amazon box I found the jacket on it's own high quality plastic garment hanger wrapped in its original packaging. Beautiful!<br /><br />I'm 6'0, 172lbs and I ordered a medium. The jacket fits well and is very well made. I like the adjustable hidden drawstring, it adds shape to the coat.<br /><br />My only concern is that the sleeve length is a tad short for my build. I'm considering getting a large to see if the sleeve length is better, making up for the additional chest room with the drawstring.<br /><br />It's not been cold enough to wear it yet, so I'll have to wait and see. But overall, it's a well made jacket.
B00A6FQH92|5|according to the price it s an excellent product and it exceed my expectation. i advise you to bye it.
B00J65SW9Q|5|Cute outfit and great price
B005GYGFZO|5|I pretty much live in pants like these because they're so comfy. Will definitely be buying more!
B00JMUJ0X2|3|The dress fit like it should. The waist was a little high, but for me it hit my natural waist. If you are going to wash the dress make sure to do so in cold water and hang dry afterwards. The color is much lighter in person than online, which doesn't bother me, but to those who want the color to be true as they are online I am giving you fair warning. Overall great dress to wear for a night out.
B009N0CT02|5|I was kind nervous to buy these only because i didn't know what the sizes were like but i decided to get a small sense i normally wear size 0 and im glad i did. it fits so perfect and they are way cute! everyone asks where i got them from. the only thing is they took forever to get here like over a month but other than that they are so worth buying!
B00FQWJW4M|5|Snappy colors and cut, great looking and fitting.
B005FUGH16|4|Looks exactly as its in the picture.<br />Good for layering and fall not for very cold weathers.u used the free shipping option and product reached in abt 7 days  as mentioned .. i use it for office.
B00CSMG7ZK|2|Too small.  It is designed for women who are petite.
B0010ZFN4W|5|The sizing on this is tricky. I am typically a medium but sometimes I have to wear a large because I am a DD and have very muscular arms for a woman. I bought the large because others said the shirt runs small. For me the fit is perfect. It actually shows that I have an hourglass figure and it is not obscenely tight. I tried it on and thought it was a bit snug. I washed it and it did not shrink. I wore it yesterday, and it loosened slightly with wear. I am going to buy another.
B00EKPO9J4|5|price and quality was awesome
B007W0T6P6|5|I wanted a pin to show my respect and service of the Vietnam War.....being a veteran I just wanted to express my pride, although many, many americans hated and demonstrated against us,, we are here.  This pin is colorful and designed to do just what I wanted.
B00IVJ121I|5|nice top
B003VKX346|5|This product is true to size and is very comfortable to wear. I love the bright colors and the added ribbon for my hair. I will come back to this site for more costumes in the future.
B007XVVMNI|3|I'm a size 14, with large hips and definitely a butt, the large was a little on the loosish size, which is definitely better then it being too small, but if I were to buy again I'd get a medium.  That being said, the material is soft, and it's comfortable, the right length of short for me without being too short (I'm 5'3 with short legs)
B0041OFBNC|5|Fun, comfortable, and warm.  What else could you ask for?
B00N20O5LA|5|FABULOUS! Looks awesome with black leggings and boots!
B00D3ZL73S|4|I can't give it 5 stars yet because I haven't gotten in the water with it on.  I'm 4'11, 125lbs it fits good.
B00KC4UC5M|2|One size does not fit all.  If you wear over a size 12,  you might have trouble squeezing into this dress.
B004VO3OEU|2|Cute and fits around head well<br /><br />But the visor flap<br />Has no fabric stabilizer in it so<br />It constantly droops down covering babies face.
B004YZ853G|5|My daughter  is very happy with these panties! They fit great and don't ride up on her leg or tushy like the elastic bottom panties. She is thrilled. I will be placing an order for more as soon as I am done with this review!~
B009FV9CZE|4|I bought two of these because they look comfortable .I'm a size 16 so I got the 16-18. I figured that it a little loose like I wanted it. It's very snug
B004L5F7BM|5|Just awesome!!
B00KSRB8AQ|5|I usually have size S, which is what I ordered, but based on the measurements I was afraid the dress would be a bit tight. When I tried it though, it is somewhat tight, but fits me perfectly. I'm very pleased.
B007XGDTWA|3|These are ok. I am 5'8&#34; so they did not go up as high as I wanted! Other than that they are good quality.
B00LYN5XFO|5|nice mask
B00FK66D6O|3|I no like this hoody the cloth is no very good.
B00B1CW1A8|5|6'2&#34; 215 lbs. the usually wear xl but got the xxl in this. fits great just like the picture  Great quality, shipped pretty quick. bought 2 first one was to small , my fault so i gave to my nephew. deffinitly buy one size bigger then your use to
B00CEH0WLY|1|The description says they are cotton/spandex but they are not, they are polyester/spandex. Wish I'd bothered to read the reviews before I ordered. Returning them.
B00BQ9FXD8|2|This same exact Dickies Short Sleeve Black Twill shirt was purchased from a local store a few days ago. After getting back home and trying it and another Dickies \\"relaxed fit\\" shirt which Amazon also sells, I found that both shirts were short in arm length, tight in the shoulders as I put it on and the material puckered at the buttons as it was too tight around the chest and belly.<br /><br />I am 6'2\\" and overweight so I bought those shirts in a 3X size but they fit like a tight 2X size. I have another Dickies SS shirt I wear in a 3X size and it fits losely and the sleeves come down to just above my elbows. Dickies tag says \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed\\" in that they will replace/exchange or refund the purchase price. We'll see if they stand behind that. IMO these shirts are manufacture defects and I should not have to pay return shipping and I'm not about to drive 50 miles round trip to the store where I bought them from which had them on sale - exchange only or store credit.<br /><br />Am highly dissatisfied with sizing quality control and now I note that others have had the same issue. The only reason I didn't rate this item as 1 star is because other than the size being wrong, it otherwise seems to be a quality shirt.
B00A2F0ZH6|5|These are incredible gloves! I've gotten to a point where I don't think it's worth owning non iPhone-conductive gloves, so I was thrilled to find a good, professional looking glove.<br /><br />Fit -<br />As many reviews say, they definitely are a tight fit. I am ~ 6' male, and wear a Large. They are tight, but comfortable.<br /><br />Conductive Finger Tips  (pointer and thumb only)<br />My pointer and thumb reach the end of the glove, which is ideal, since I actually have surprisingly fine control of my iPhone. Control is obviously worse than bare fingers, but I am able to do all basic gestures with ease (open phone, answer calls, etc), and don't even mind texting with them. I can't type as fast as normal, but I can usually type accurately!<br /><br />Warmth -<br />This is my first season wearing them, and so far am happy enough with their warmth. They are no ski-gloves, but I find them warm enough for a New York winter. Fleece-lining is incredible soft.<br /><br />Look -<br />Downright sleek. Very soft, nice-looking leather, accented with three elegant stitches.<br /><br />For all you iPhone 5s owners, unfortunately the technology to transfer your finger-print through a glove has not yet been developed ;)<br /><br />These gloves are a must-have!
B00FA7G08E|5|We love these head bands, really trendy and warm. I'm giving them as Christmas presents!
B009YDFZ36|3|The cut was too large and too tall which is not something I am used to saying with clothes. I wear a 52 chest with 38&#34; sleeves and the XXLT was huge. I had at least 8&#34; of chest space and the sleeves were very long.  The fabric is a stiff canvas fabric that is like a lighter version of the fabric Carhartt made famous on their other coats and work overalls.  The cut didn't taper in at all so there was more room at the waist than in the chest.  Returned it. Bought a Marmot Guide's Down XXL and it fit perfect although the fabric is not as rugged but I wanted a down coat that fits.
B000MNBNF6|5|I have two of these shirts.  I like them since they cut are full on the full size and fit my big frame.  If you are a big guy and are tired of looking for a XXL shirt that is really a XXL shirt then shop no further.
B00FN5JSKA|5|super cute
B003IBNIFC|4|I'm a size 9/10 so I figured I'd be fine ordering the medium.  Got the package and it was way too small! There is no stretch in this fabric. Also if you are busty / curvy be sure to order a size up. The package says teen size so maybe that's why. Other than that I'm really happy with it. Great quality for the price.
B00HSZG2SE|5|Excellent
B00HN4CF36|5|Love it!
B00HR7CSC2|4|A bit large. I'm 168 cm and I got M.
B003XVYB4E|5|I love these so much that I ended up ordering eight pairs!  Have washed them several times and so far no bagging at the knees, pilling, fading, etc.  (Danskin used to be this way.)  The only negative is that, if you have sensitive skin as I do, you may need to wash them a couple of times before wearing, or the dye may be slightly irritating to the skin.  Also, they are quite warm, so even though I love to wear leggings in any weather, some may find these too hot for summer.  Still, overall, these are high quality, well-fitting leggings that should last a long time.
B004M6UDC8|4|Very functional wallet with it's many compartments & slots for credit cards, business cards, or whatever.  The only disappointment is the emblem came off after a couple weeks! Overall, a better than good product!
B005CGBOOI|5|it just the same with picture. very warm and nice quality. good choice for cold weather. suitble for the price.
B00C867MVY|5|I really like longer shorts because I find my legs getting cold quite easily and 3/4 shorts seem to allow an extra amount of freedom as well as great ventilation compared to jeans.<br /><br />Of course this has a lot to do with the material and thankfully the material is super thin but comfortable from the outset.<br />I was previously checking out similar shorts in the more hi-tech climate controlling type polyester/nylon blends but the price for those here is more than 2x these and as cotton offers great breathe-ability anyway I thought I'd try these out (esp thanks to Amazon's free returns on clothes).<br />Glad I did as I loved em and am likely to buy a few more pairs at least...just wish they had a few more colors.<br />I wear such a format for all sorts of casual tasks like walking/lounging on the weekends as well as more active sports including longboarding /biking.
B009OYPVNE|2|uncomfortable.  hate the material
B00EHU8I62|4|I love this skirt. It has stretched a little, so it's a bit larger than I thought it would be, but it has worked great for cold winter days. I probably could have gotten away with one size smaller, but really it all depends on where you want your skirt to hit on your hips. I tend to wear them a bit higher.
B00SYDMBQQ|1|Was too small and not what I expected
B00IPUIBEE|3|Nice. Bought to wear under something else
B005L8YVKG|4|This was a nice replacement for my husbands old wallet. He broke it in the very first day. This is a nice upgrade to his previous wallet. He likes the bi-fold wallet with slip out card holder. Thank you!
B003IC4XI2|5|Great
B007M82NHQ|1|Kind of an awkward look to the, way it lays on the body.
B00LPS946C|3|Liked this,  but was larger than expected.  I had to take it in to keep it up on my hips.
B00NHYXXAK|5|Bought it for my daughters first birthday. Loved it!
B00K8D03MY|4|Might need to order a size up was smaller then what I thought
B00M0D8STK|2|They were too small and had a small tear
B00GBCN0T4|4|Fits well.  Came early.  Looks good.  Only difference from the Ad picture is that the gray sash doesn't come included.
B00EV2Y8B0|5|Great key case, not a wallet. It fells very soft and looks great, i was able to get all my keys in, which wasn't easy, but i would not say it's a bad thing, cause if it's hard to put the keys, you won't loose them. amazing quality for the price
B001S5JDQS|5|I followed the advice of another person and ordered a size larger around the waste. That makes it extremely comfortable when you bend over. They are very functional and heavy duty. Anybody that spends a lot of time on their knees want to be sure to get pants with double knees. I love them. They are great to work in. Lots of pockets. Well worth the money. Remember - YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
B0037NYFW6|5|excelent
B0007NXV6K|4|Purchased for an older woman's use as a simple, inexpensive, easily donned and easily accessorized Halloween costume. Cape is soft, lightweight and well made; good, deep color; full coverage keeps her head, arms and legs nice and warm; worn with flat, thick-soled boots helps prevent tripping in the dark (thin fabric is easily trimmed and re-hemmed if necessary); new every year on October 31st.
B00THO2F3A|2|cheap fabric
B00AXWGRL6|4|Just got these in the mail today & so far they're not bad looking. I tried them on & they go just a little bit above my ankle. Please take note that I'm 5'1\\". The calf area is a bit looser than what I expected, but you get what you pay for. Especially without trying them on in the first place. I gave it 4 stars because the pattern is pretty good & because it is hard for me to find pants at the right length. I'm hoping they'll start to stretch out & elongate with a little wash & wear. Worth it for the price & if you're a short woman. We'll see how long they hold up for. Thinking about ordering the different shades, but maybe in a month or so when I see how happy I am with these.
B007L3PXTC|1|extremely scratchy and rough. My son would have to wear two or three shirts to be able to tolerate the rough texture.  Plus the size is very small for what I ordered...like a toddler+ size.  Surprised this is a &#34;genuine&#34; military issue.  Won't buy another and will donate this one to charity with the lesson learned: Get what you pay for.
B005L1881Q|2|it is a cute outfit and a good price.  However the pants are terrible they do not fit right nor stay up.  My daughter wore this one I still use the top but the pants are useless.
B00C2DJ81K|5|Absolutely worth every penny! ❤️
B0093JFWGQ|5|Great product made a great gift.
B00TBFPZ2I|4|Great even cuts your appetite
B0037TIDY6|5|I ordered these for my twin grandsons who were turning six.  They loved them.  I was satisfied that they seemed to be pretty well made.  The fact they had masks in all the colors was a great idea.  It lets them be which ever turtle they want to be.  It was a hit.
B007VI2OD0|5|I'm very picky about my wardrobe, including swim trunks, so I'm just ecstatic about the quality of these trunks.  They look just like the picture.  Since I've been losing weight I'm just about ready to purchase another pair.  I would highly recommend these trunks bc they not only look great but are of excellent quality, not skimpy on the fabric.  I'm 52 and I've always been a swimmer, so with that said these are the best pair I've ever owned.
B00439DA4M|2|So being a fan of the show, I bought this shirt in a heartbeat.     It showed up on time however there's two things that others should be aware about in purchasing this.    The actual grenade logo on the shirt is A LOT smaller than the actual picture provided on the site. In fact I would think it's at least 50% of what's shown on the picture displayed on Amazon.com.    I did get a Large, however I didn't think the logo would be so... small. In fact, I don't think it scales at all with the bigger sizes. They must use the same size print that they use for XS on all the other shirts. -_-;;    Second thing is that the t-shirt is 100% combed cotton... meaning just from the feel of it I can tell it's going to shrink quite a bit after its first wash.    I'm a bit disappointed but hey, it's a t-shirt. And it's a t-shirt from the Jersey Shore TV show so I guess I shouldn't have expected much right?    Oh well...     It's t-shirt tiiiiiiiiiime!
B00GBL85VS|5|I use them for bikram yoga and so far they perform well.
B00F8LEBJC|5|They have a good, vibrant color, are soft, and higher quality than what I was expecting from such an inexpensive pair of socks. And the best part - they actually fit my boyfriend's giant feet! Very pleased.
B00F3WDR9Q|5|I can't wait to wear it, just got my shirt tonight.<br /><br />The fit is really flattering as most reviews have stated. I am 5'1, 125lbs, and curvy in all the wrong places :) this shirt makes me feel very sexy. Its the right level of sophistication.
B00KIWDE4Y|1|Not good
B004FDGZH0|2|I was warned!
B00KIATCME|4|The breast little to big, but it could be my daughter..... beautiful dress
B000SKI76G|4|Only decent option for bigger feet...without spending $$$.  Can't beat the price for socks that actually fit my size 15 feet.
B00801Q3ZC|4|This shirt is very nice and looks well made.  The print is a little dark but it is black ink on a darker gray shirt.  It doesn't negatively affect the shirt at all but if you consider the colors this shouldn't surprise you.<br /><br />Regarding the logo many people have mentioned, as of the time I made my purchase there was no logo on the front of the shirt, by the tail of the snake or otherwise.  Yes there is small text on the sleeve as shown in the picture but it doesn't detract from the shirt and isn't uncommon with shirts.  I would recommend this shirt.
B005VVHRRW|1|The &#34;Elite&#34; version of these lenses are sold as meting ANSI 87.1 impact standards.  The lenses come with no paperwork certifying that claim, nor are the lenses marked as ANSI 87.1.  In other words, Revant is lying and charging upwards of three times the price for non ANSI 87.1 certified lenses.<br /><br />Buyer beware if you actually need ANSI 87.1 lenses for work.
B00KSV7G12|4|Beautiful dress. I like the material not thin or see through. And the length is just right above my knee. I advice before you buy the dress make sure to check the measurement because the dress does not stretch. I got the small and I'm 5' tall and 96 lbs.
B00KOWEY88|5|Loved this tank - soft, fit is perfect, arrived quickly. My husband says this is one of his favorite shirts I'm just disappointed because it looks like they are out of stock or have discontinued.
B00EUY51C4|3|Pattern made me look wide (I'm an xs). Husband gave it a big thumbs down
B0018OHISE|4|As always, a good product with a great fit! I just wish they cost a bit less, like they used to!
B00H21FGOA|5|bought a pair for 2 of my grandsons. I think the quality is great and the price is good. Material is nice and the boys loved them.
B00ANBWGEO|5|I have others in this style and like them all.  They are nice and roomy and have pretty colors in non-boring prints.
B007PSE3DA|5|These beautiful pj's were delivered by Fed X Christmas Eve day. That is the day we have our family Christmas. After cooking most of the day being rather exhausted I took my shower and decided to try on the new pajamas.  They felt like silk on my skin... the fit was so comfortable so I kept them on to finish party preparation..  When it was time to dress for dinner, I looked in the mirror and decided I loved these pj's and was going to wear them for our family celebration!  and I did. My family did not know until I told them, so our family Christmas photos have me in my new lovely pajamas. I have washed them and they wash and dry beautifully. Hoping to get another pair soon.
B00BGYNSW6|5|Recommend. Son said the work great!!
B003U709WE|4|I thought this bag was very colorful and has just the right size for my pre-school son. However, now I am realizing that is too much colors for a boy, and that the straps need some improvement.
B00QRGJXX6|5|Great price and fast shipping but it was too small
B005F9ER1E|5|Bought these for my 15 year old daughter. She loves to wear them and she said they fit great. They were a great price and shipped quickly !
B00KFGAWHK|5|Bought this for a friend and they love it.
B00J5FM9I2|5|Cute back pack.  Bought for my 8 y/o and 10 y/o sons.  They love it.  Hoodie fits inside of the pocket at the top of the backpack.  However, the pocket (stuffed with the hoodie) takes up us space inside of the backpack.  Not a problem for my 8 y/o but it bothers my 10 y/o (pushes up against his back) so he just leave the hoodie out at all times.  Still a super cute backpack.
B00A0GLAM6|5|Unicorn mask arrived earlier than expected, perfectly on time for when I needed it, bought it to go with an anniversary present for my boyfriend (a horse mask). I love this mask, and the looks that people give me when I wear it are hilarious! The only thing I would warn buyers about is that you need to air the mask out for a few days. When you first get it, the latex smell makes it very hard to breathe. My suggestion is to hang it upside down from a pants hanger (with gentle clips) and leave it near a vent until ready to wear. Other than that, it's great! I was a little worried by some of the reviews, but when the mask came in it matched the picture and I couldn't have asked for a better one for the price. Definitely recommend this seller, would buy from them again!
B00G8OKXW2|5|These skivvies are amazing!  I need extreme support -- its critical following a botched hernia surgery -- until I found these I was wearing a jockstrap  everyday, as recommended by a surgeon.  I've picked up at least 20 pairs in the last few months  I even picked up a pair of the the hundred dollar variety.  They are really nice, but I am good with the $35 variety.  I do prefer the styles that don't have any cotton in them.<br /><br />I figured out how to adjust the pouch after several trys -- just experiment until you get it the way you like it.
B00BPI91Q0|5|Love it!
B00TL5KLJ0|4|Good tank for everyday around the house when breastfeeding.
B00AJWESXO|5|I ordered three of these in different colors, all very soft,not real heavy flannel, fit well, I wear a size 10/12 usually in shirts or a large, and the large fits me perfectly.  Price is good and quality is really good, also washes well.
B0091MMPF6|2|when i received my package it was very nicely wrapped and the hat did not get damaged which was my main worry. unfortunately the title is a little misleading. i wear snap backs all the time and they all fit well this is the first i have bumped into that is tiny. i gave the hat to my 10 year old cousin and it fit him perfectly i just wish they would change &#34;men's&#34; snap back into &#34;youth&#34; snap back.
B0021WF67W|4|Hat fit great, provides good protection from the sun.  The rim is too pliable and cannot get it to stay in place, but otherwise love the hat.
B00T6Q35YM|1|I gave it to a very tiny friend, who wears a small, sometimes medium, in shirts, and who has no breasts whatsoever. fit her fine, even though it was an XL
B004C0VBEI|5|This product shipped in a timely fashion, is exactly as it looks in the picture. Low rise, flattering to the man-hood, very comfortable, holds everything in place well. The fit was perfect for me, I would definitely buy another pair. Somewhat see through, but I don't mind.
B008GBSE94|5|Very nice
B00H9MWZ0U|4|I liked the padding, extra lining.  It would be perfect if I wasn't so tall. Being 6'2&#34; tall the bra front area squishes my breasts together and the back is too high on my back side.  The straps are too short for tall people; no adjustment added. I have to unhook three top hooks to give them puppies room to breathe.  Give us tall people 1-2 inches extra fabric in the center front horizontally please.  Also, when I first started wearing the bra the bottom/center area rubbed me a bit raw, but now it is OK.<br /><br />Anyone of normal size would LOVE this bra.  I AM going to order more!
B004WMQB7S|5|I was recently professionally fitted, and was looking for bras in my size (40G) that were affordable.  I love this one. I really do. It's the first time ever that the center part actually does touch my chest wall.  The cups are slightly stretchy, not itchy at all.  The band is roomier than other bras I've purchased at the same size, but that's no big deal.  The straps stay on with no problem. The support is great, and the bra is stylish (so hard to find in my size without looking like Grandma's bra)  I am going back to order more of them - this was the best yet.
B00SMA42WM|2|Bottom fit but the top was way too small
B00GB00SIW|3|Jacket is nice enough but the sleeves are way to long and the sleeves have only one snap on cuffs. Would have returned it but my son who is taller than I am said he would take it. I purchased a different brand that I have used in the past for myself and now everybody is happy.
B00MIKC7ZG|1|I splurged on this for my 12 month old (I know... it was silly.)  The outfit is super cute.  I would give it zero stars if I could because the fabric pilled after three washes.  THREE WASHES.  This is significantly overpriced as now it looks like it came from good will.  not that there's anything wrong with good will.  and I bought two sets, one for a boy (24 mo) and girl (12 mo).  Both pilled equally.  So disappointing.
B0076R5S2A|3|This is a very durable jacket and water repellent but I guess I misunderstood what Omni-shield meant.  I was thinking breathable fabric.  We wore ours at a cruise stop in Greenland with another jacket underneath.  When we took off the outer Columbia jacket, the inside of the sleeves and the inner jacket were drenched.  Other reviews have attributed this to water passing through the jacket on rainy days but in our case, it was a sunny but cold day.  Apparently there is little to no breatheability in the jacket fabric and body moisture has no place to go.  It is a nice windbreaker and is especially convenient in that it packs into a very small self-contained bag.  But if you want a breathable fabric, look for something better.
B00KA4FJWK|4|Great fit...
B002XM7CC2|5|More than what I expected,this sword is a must have if you're a collector like me.Very strong grip,doesn't feel cheap at all.
B0002TOS7A|3|They hold up well and are very reliable socks.  But I probably will look for more cotton in socks; seems like most socks now have too much spandex that they can cut off circulation.
B000F276WI|2|These just really aren't for big busted women.  I'm a 38D and was hoping this would be a good to wear under tops that are low cut, it doesn't stay in place well enough to do the job though.
B00B6E997O|5|these are my favorite overalls nbow. i have been in -25 degree weather and they protected me. they are way better than carhart and much easier to clean. also easier to put on
B00TAZT9B2|4|Personally, I really like these swim bottoms. They are very small cut and on the sexy side. I am size 8 and the medium fits like a glove, the skirt offers a bit of modesty but it is still sexy and not at all the granny panty or brief cut of many other skirted bottoms. These are for a confident woman who doesn't mind the low on the hips style. The crochet is very pretty. Product came quickly, tags and liner on, nicely packaged. Would recommend!
B002ZBMIA2|5|I ordered this for my 8 lb 1 month old. I ordered the 3-6 size first because the 0-3 said under 8 lbs. I ended up returning it for the 0-3 size and it is perfect! Very cute! One of the cutest most affordable I've seen!
B00856YNZE|4|These are pretty good. Not as stretchy as I expected and I wish they were a bit longer. Well made though and not bad for $15.
B0078Z065E|4|I bought two of these. My bartender wore this for a casino night celebration at my business, and everyone loved it, and she looked awesome! Then my niece and I wore this for a Polar Penguin Plunge for a Make A Wish fundraiser. ! It was a big hit! Material a little thin, had to wear a layer under the top and short shorts as it is very short. All in all pleased with my purchase.
B00DK3GJ3Q|5|Fit as expected and very comfortable!  Purchased this for a costume but will wear it with an oversized bone colored shirt to dress it up!
B00JB93WHO|4|The size seemed small for a five, otherwise it was fine.
B008BHIFYM|3|lose fitting, a little wider than I imagined it to be but with the tie it isn't bad, very light weight and comfortable.
B001L994YW|5|Sturdy, well made.  I wear one every day.  I think I bought 10...
B0051EPUKK|1|I just bought 2 Polo Ralph Lauren Men V-Neck Pony Logo T-Shirt XL and the size is totally different than the store, is way too big.
B00DYRINN2|5|My sons favorite characters in one pack, wears all the time and color hasn't faded through all the washes.
B005GYGEWS|5|Cery good could buy like 4 of them strchy and nuce doesnt lose the strech after waches.
B000WK5CV0|4|Just be careful with the bra top as it is very loose on the bottom and rises up.  Otherwise, adorable outfit!
B00CYHQOSY|5|This was a perfect fit I ordered a large because everyone said get it in a size up and it fit's perfectly. This material is durable and it looks exactly the way it does in the picture. I was suppose to receive it in 26 days but I got it in 11. I am extremely pleased with this item .
B00DIXJDCC|5|My first Ane Klein dres and love it, the lengh is perfect if you want it knee lengh. The size fits on me just as I like my dresses. I already bought a red one just like this, can´t wait till it gets here.
B0014DAF16|4|What can one say about Fruit of the Loom shorts?  This package of three is fairly priced and the shorts are in a variety of colors.  The shorts don't shrink and are very comfortable.
B00CN5HG48|5|For the price this can't be beat!  Good quality thick material and fairly quick delivery, about 2 weeks.  I would order from this seller again but be careful of the sizing. I'm 5'6&#34; and 129lbs and a medium was too big.
B00DTINAKC|5|bought the shirt for my nephew for Christmas shipped fast and very cool shirt
B00C9RGJ1G|5|Hubby loves!
B00375MO54|5|I had purchased this dress for a bridal shower.  too many compliments to list!!!!   wears well, doesn't wrinkle,  looks nice and most Amy byer stuff seems to be well made.  purchased for a 5 year old who loved it.  gave her more of a \\"big girl\\" look with a dress made of great material without bears, dolls, etc all over it!   highly recommend!
B00E1L9UE6|3|Nice style, tight for a large. I am usually a medium or large, this is a Large size and it too small for me.
B001KWFBYC|3|I wish it would bind better but it will do..
B00TQ8NDSS|2|The odd socks look exactly as pictured but the material is what makes them odd.  Very tight, thick material with little give made our gift of socks a dud. Disappointing because otherwise they were exactly what we were looking for.
B00JXN1IRY|4|Color is pretty. Everything looks good together hat fits good
B00475V88W|5|These gloves are very nice. I gave three pairs as Christmas gifts and each of the recipients have commented about how warm the Thinsulate material is compared to others they have had in the past. The colors are very much as pictured. They were shipped from the UK, but arrived in about 10 days, even during Christmas season.
B0043O9NBG|4|These were purchased for a client, they arrived timely. Appeared to be in good condition. I have not heard any complaints from the client regarding these pants.
B005H3BT46|5|Shows fast! Awesome
B00MY8KW36|5|Nice quality
B00LAI7NO2|3|I love these dresses, but they are too small in the bust. I am about a 38DD/40D and there just isn't enough room. They are gathered under the bust, and it doesn't cover. The gathering starts mid chest. I need a smaller size through the waist, but I won't order a smaller size because of the chest. NY Deals ships quickly, and I do love the dress! It's just not the right cut for anyone with a larger chest.
B000FH2JSE|2|Overall these are great bib overalls. But I do have one issue. I have never ripped any jacket coveralls or bib pants in my life that were made of duck cotton. I've had carhartt, walls, burne, Schmidt you name it I've had or still have it. The first day I wore these my chest pocket somehow got caught on something and the stitched on burne logo ripped off and just to the side of it there is a hole now, not a hole where the logo was, it's actually beside it. So I'd say that either these are cheaply made compared to my past items or the others I have are made better. Either way these shouldn't have ripped on the first day.
B00VIZ5U1A|5|good quality and he loved it!!
B00PD1H2YI|2|Extremely large so large i dont even wear them.
B00M3O3IUU|5|bien
B007CFD3FA|4|Good quality, fit, light and warm.  I would say if you have a very big head they might be too small; fine on me, put them on my husband to let him check them out and they didn't fit.
B009JW8PNE|1|I chose this because my husband love batman. However the first time he wore it a button broke off and the stitchi is comi undone! Not a good product
B001XUQQI6|5|My 6 year old son loves his briefs so much that I had to tell him not to show them in public haha. I bought these briefs about 2 years ago but since the elasctic band is strong but doesn´t hurt, he could wear them since then, and still he has them and wear them after hundreds of launderings.
B003371GIW|5|my husband loves it soft leather great
B00FB6SFXM|3|Cute and stylish but after one wash the sleeves are now a little shorter.  I have long arms so I notice when this happens.  Otherwise this sweater is pretty nice if you're not so sensitive to that.
B0009W5J3W|1|This product isn't made for people who are short, it sticks you in the lower back and breaks skin. When I sit down it pokes me in the thigh.
B00DSQT1FS|5|Cool pant
B007L6IDHS|3|I'm giving these a 3 star rating only because they're not like any other yoga pants I have. Once you get them on, they stick to you and don't move. I dislike being \\"hugged\\" all day by my pants. I ordered a size large and I would say they run small. I am 5'7 190 lbs and they were pretty tight on me. They are especially low rise compared to any other pants I have as well. Maybe because I'm \\"too big\\" for them, I don't know. The quality and material is the same as you would find at a store just thinner. I read several reviews about these being \\"see through\\" before I bought them and took the chance anyway. I would not say they are \\"see through\\" exactly but you can see what's on your underwear. I may just wear them as lounge around the house pants but wouldn't wear them out. I ordered the heather gray pant with black fold over.
B009043DAQ|5|Runs a touch small IMO but were still a great fit. Fast shipping!
B00B6KGOYY|5|Wore this sweater with a pant set to a Christmas benefit. It was very comfortable, fit nicely and i enjoyed the sparkle. Received several compliments. looking forward to  wearing it again.
B00DF6FOK2|5|The recipient was very pleased and loved the colors!  She has already picked a pair to wear in the maternity ward!
B008MDNGA8|5|I ordered this and had it embroidered and absolutely love it. large enough to fit 2 irons in!
B00MSRYPRW|5|Daughter loved it. It's a Halloween Costume, it's Pajamas.
B0054RW2A0|5|Great product, great material, but I assumed since the title of the product said \\"wristbands\\" it came in a pack of two. Sadly I was mistaken, as it's only for one wristband. Would have loved to save on shipping and bought 2 at the same time, but eh, live and learn.
B0009Z3NXC|4|It was realy a wounderful suprise
B000ARG1VU|2|Just a thin socks
B008OITD08|5|Excellent
B00D4IZ3C0|3|Bought the largest size available and it barely fits my 3 year old! Super cute design. Feels like a high quality product.
B00LGI9OQG|3|******Update********** It is with a sad and heavy heart that I report that this coat has become nearly useless to me and will not survive another winter. I've had it for about a year and only worn it for about 4 months out of the two winter seasons I've owned it. First, the little tab on the zipper (the thing you pull on to open or close the zipper), just fell off one of the pockets - no big deal, because who zips up the pockets anyway, right? Except that it made it look a bit cheap. Then the little piece at the bottom of the zipper (the part you stick in so it catches the other side) fell off and the inner zipper will no long zip up, or when it does zip, as soon as I move, the zipper separates from the bottom. Then, the really long zipper, for the outer part of the coat, is having trouble zipping as the little zipper teeth are coming loose and moving around and not always catching when I pull the zipper up to close.   I've always been very careful with this coat and taken very good care of it when wearing it, or when it was put away during the warmer months. There is really no good reason for it to be falling apart like it is and it's really heartbreaking that it is. Admittedly, it's still very warm when you can get it to close properly, but if it doesn't zip up, who cares if it's warm? I really thought this one would last me a while, but rather than deal with the zippers and getting those holes where the zipper separates and trying to haggle with the zipper to make it go back down, I've been wearing a smaller, less warm coat, which really, really stinks! Because this coat only has zippers and no buttons or even belt, it just hangs open and when it gets windy, I may as well not be wearing a coat.   So I've reduced my rating. Sorry, Bagheera!  ********************************************************************************************   I think I love this coat so much because I got it for an incredible price, but then again, the price is only incredible, because it's such a great coat! I should have paid a lot more for it!  Because I don't live in an area that has frigid temperatures, I don't handle the freezing cold weather very well when it does come around at winter. As the climate has been going bonkers the last few years and we are getting temperatures that belong far north of us, I've come to find that Bagheera (yes, I named my coat) has been the greatest wardrobe purchase I've just about ever made. It is not only very warm, but it also is somewhat form fitting, so you don't look like a giant sleeping bag waddling down the road. I'm not keen on having a zipper from the very bottom of the coat all the way to the top, I'd prefer buttons or snaps so you could choose how much to close off, but when I do have to zip up the outer layer, it's actually quite cozy on the inside. The inside layer with it's own zipper is fantastic. It's also pretty water proof...or maybe &#34;resistant&#34; is the right word.  Unfortunately, I won't wear this coat for much longer as Spring will be working its way into my wardrobe pretty soon, but for the 8 - 30 something degree temperatures we've had this year, I've been ever so grateful for this coat. I've gotten many compliments on it as well. So, it's not just for warmth and a great big ol' hug, but it also looks pretty good (as good as winter coats can) doing it!
B00H3VIOGG|4|I actually liked these a lot.  I love the length and the fit is really good.  The heat it accumulates is pretty awesome.
B00ACIFVYU|1|The shirts that I received do not correspond with the product description, they are the &#34;Comfort Soft 100% Cotton&#34; and not &#34;Stretch 95% Cotton/5% Spandex&#34;.
B00KCYQE18|4|I got size Xlarge because I had read all the comments about them being too small. I like them, they're<br />Comfortable but that's the only thing I didn't like the size. If there wouldn't been xxlarge I would reorder and get that size. Other than that I weight 120-5 and I'm 5&#34;4..
B00C5GLRWW|4|It's pretty but just to small.
B00LHAT1WU|4|Gave to my grandson for Christmas. He loves them. They are soft but not a heavy material.
B001ADASF8|5|My son Loved the Ford Belt Buckle. It was exactly what he was wanting. And the price was great! Thanks  :)
B009Q21868|5|Great performance given that it's really thin and comfortable
B00EZI170A|4|I got this for my girlfriend to wear as Athena (me being Ares or Apollo) and she likes it. With a few modifications it will fit her very well.
B00NGECFQO|5|Well, my first review on Amazon, but they asked me, and I have to say, these are the best jeans EVER!!  True to size, fit like a glove, don't bag out at all,  Just washed them, used cold water and air dry, will see how they are, I'm sure they are fine.
B00RH2BFQC|5|The belt was exactly what I wanted. . . and the price was wonderful
B007HCAFH2|1|the description stated the shirt was a small to medium, it was not.  It was a large to extra large.  I was very disappointed.
B00DZYTZPO|5|It's a beer shirt disguised as a Jeep shirt....  Of course, I love it.
B00M21OWWC|1|I can't even give this a star.....this is NOT a waist trainer!!!<br />False advertising....I am so upset, total waste of my money.
B00F88QHM4|5|Perfect!
B00NYAULAM|5|Comfortable and easy to breathe in
B005UGTRVW|4|Fit nicely and interesting color. Arrived in good tome and well packaged. Good during the past cold winter days.  may order another pair at a later date.
B008I1AC6K|5|very, very good!
B001JF0IVQ|3|I tried this on in the store and wanted it, but was already purchasing bras that I really needed so when the time came I thought I'll just order it on line.  Unfortunately there was \\"slack\\" in the right breast cup (a small wrinkle) it didn't lay fitted and flat and if I have to pull on a bra consistently, then you can forget about me wearing it and Prima Donna prices constitute WEARING WHAT YOU BUY!!!
B00QKQILP4|5|Well made and very warm. Our boys just love their Thomas PJ's!
B00QA1XZ6O|2|Ordered a medium and the bottom part seemed it was an x-small.
B00QZTOWEK|5|Good socks
B00422M6JK|4|Made of good, solid leather. I think this wallet will last for quite a while. Has all the need slots for credit cards and cash, etc.
B00BBLB4CK|3|Could definitely tell it was a wig though, I wanted something a bit more realistic. It's unfortunate, I should have known by the price.
B009LEUW4A|5|This dress is beautiful, bought it for my 8 years old daughter and ordered size 8 and it fits perfectly. Seems to be of good quality, have not worn yet to an event. She loved it after trying it on at home and did not want to take it off.
B00O9RW2T2|5|The dress is true to size and very well made.
B00GAB7RW2|5|Love all volvox shorts. I have them in lots of colors.
B009043CU2|5|This is a great skort for the beach  Fits just right
B00565VYD6|5|These are great jeans. They fit very tight, like leggings. I got the short so they cut off right at my ankles with no bunching. Very satisfied.
B00BT0J272|4|The font color makes it difficult to read. A black outline around the letters could fix this problem.
B00BPFL1SE|5|I love these. They fit super cute and with no muffin top. I'm a pant size 14-16, and i ordered the 3-4X so i could have some wiggle room. they fit on the tightest notch! it's perfect! The only down side i guess would be that the strap is a little too long, if it were shorter i would be able to wear my thigh-highs higher up on my leg but i have to lower them to accommodate.
B007GVEY4E|1|Product arrived with birthday girl writing missing. It looks very cheap.
B00NIOL91E|5|Comfy, soft, and great beach dress. I added a hat and flip flops and perfect.
B00RWYGG14|2|I am a little disappointed in this scarf I thought it would look like the picture but it does have a patch of this design Also it has many other patches with designs I don't care for I wish they would of shown the whole scarf it isn't very pretty
B00401R9N6|3|I was dressing up for a party...going as Sherlock Holmes...it worked for the party, but not much else. It's okay.
B00I3ZO4SI|5|Beautiful blue and even nicer than pictured.  My Dad loves Cuba Vera, he was very happy to get this for his birthday.
B0051U184Q|5|Can't beat car hart for heavy duty quality. Fit good and washes beautifully. The price was unbelievable, should have bought more.
B00E4M13R4|2|Loved this sweater and even cuter in person. However, its a tighter fit so recommend you order a size larger.
B00ADKM0U0|5|Darling outfit, looks good on.  Soft fabric and pretty pattern with silver.  Shirt comes down to hip which is perfect with the tights.
B007TI2VI0|4|I purchased and loved them but too tight and a bit too short if they could just make one more sixe bigger and taller im sure there are a lot of people out there wanting the same thing
B00329YCDW|5|They just get more beautiful and I have enjoyed wearing this item and can not wait until I purchase as many as I can to add to my wardrobe..........
B00JYM9C86|5|LOVE. color is tan not yellow which was good. Sparkle is amazing. Turned out great as flower girl dress
B00MWVIG7Y|5|My daughter calls this her Princess Dress.....!!
B00E8AKMP6|5|I was looking for some nice bikini bottoms with minimal coverage (without being a thong) and these were perfect. Covers enough to be pool appropriate but is more on the cheeky side without being vulgar. Very cute! I am 5'1 118lbs with 36 inch hips and the small was the tiniest bit too small at first, but after wearing it a couple times it seemed to stretch and fit to me better.
B00SXU145O|2|The fitting of this dress is somewhat weird... it fits on me perfectly but putting it on me is  a whole fight between me and this dress, it is so tight, but once it is on me it looks gorgeous on me, I decided to keep it even I had to fight hard putting it on, as they say &#34;A tortured Fashion&#34; hahaha!
B008ER7YCS|5|I ordered this for a Christmas Gift, Delivery was fast and the product was legit! IM POSITIVE my signifigant other will love it too!
B00K1B275Y|2|The jacket is beautiful, but it runs too small. I was hoping it was going to fit a bit big for my one year old, so I got a 2T which she has some clothes that size and it's too big but not this one. It beatly fits.
B00FO3AK62|1|When I finally received this scarf I was very disappointed. It's very very cheap looking and made out of cheap material. It looks thick and plush in the picture, but it's actually very thin. You can see right thru it. It had loose threads everywhere and the edges are harsh and coming apart. Not even worth my time sending it back... It's going in my dog's bed, so she can lay on it..... very unhappy
B005EVLQGM|5|I needed a new coat when I found this London Fog. It is a great coat. Very warm, rain resistant and long enough to keep your backside warm and dry. Well made as a London Fog is known for. Very pleased with the coat, arrived on time and at a very good price.
B00HYHUHSW|3|It's big enough for a 10year old. I bought it for my 5year old.  I will have to wait 5 years.
B00OQRO356|1|Says they are modal, but does not act like any other clothing I've had made of modal. The fabric pilled and was see through from the first time I put them on
B0040I68OA|5|Bought this for my step son as a wedding gift, (aka JR Groomsmen) this is his first real wallet as he is 11 so he beats it to hell and it takes it. Couldn't have asked for a better looking nicer buy and it is Guess so he feels adult.
B00EWC08UO|4|These do fit  a little large. They are comfortable and I have always preferred white cotton.  White cotton was recommended by my GYN years ago as  &#34;healthier&#34;  than a satin or polyester type material.
B00EPYB3D0|4|Very nice dress look great I like very much
B00M7EJ4EA|5|Fits great and I've had a lot of complements on it, So get off your ass and order one !
B0008ENZKA|5|I like these jeans better than the levi's or wrangler that I have gotten before. I'll likely buy them again when I need another pair of black jeans.
B006PHXUOU|3|This product is NOT the &#34;magic bullet&#34; for those of us who carry all the required health, dental, driver's license, etc. in our wallet. So, I put only the most necessary items in here and still had marginal room for cash (perhaps a couple of $20 bills). The rest I left in my old wallet and it stays in my car.<br /><br />Still, having said that, it IS one-half the thickness of my leather wallet. It does organize the contents very well and keeps everything I need in easy access. No more &#34;four-digit&#34; digging for a crumpled business card or I.D. This in itself is reason enough for me to appreciate this product.
B00V1KSIAW|3|The shape is quite different as a picture and look less bohemian then expected....
B0055WQG8I|5|The tight is comfortable and pretty.My young daughter loves it very much. We will try other colors or styles, too.
B000ZN51UQ|5|I've already added the eyelet trim to collar, cuffs, and bottom (soon to add some to the pocket).  It's a fun shirt to wear.
B00IUOL1XI|5|These were an anniversary gift for my husband. He L-O-V-E-S them! They fit perfectly, and looked great. There is a weird smell when you first open them. The smell faded after a few hours, and went completely away after washing.
B00R6PK09I|5|Seems to be great quality leather and is super slim. I sometimes freak out thinking it's not there.
B0083EZCG2|5|Great gift, well made, got it for my father for his birthday, gadsden and culpeper make some fantastic items, take a look at their website -- [...]    They have great patches, stickers, jackets and shirts, worthy of any God fearing, country-loving patriotic American.
B00MBAI7YI|5|I thought it was black and yellow but it's brown and yellow
B006ZZAIL0|3|Neckline is too low! This offers no chest coverage.  Pick something else.
B00HY3NLD4|4|looks cute but crushes your genitals so if you want to look good I would get them but don't plan on being comfortable..  I would Maby get these one size bigger
B00KFRB8TU|4|I have recently lost weight, and I don't know what size I wear, but I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 100 lbs.  unfortunately, this skirt isn't offered in XS.  In fact, as many brands of similar skirts Amazon carries, I was unable to find one that comes in XS.  I like the style and comfort of it. I got a dark color because people complained about the fabric being thin and transparent.  It isn't a problem with my skirt.  With luck, I'll gain a little weight and it will stay up better.  If it fit me, I'd give it five stars.
B00DEK3IAC|5|I am so pleased with the quality and fit of this robe. The material is very plush and the L/XL fit me (I'm 6'1 and 200 lbs) perfectly.<br /><br />I paid under $40 and that's a great deal compared to what I found at the department stores checked.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend this item!
B00RMG305C|5|Very comfortable. Stay where you originally put them.<br />I recently purchased these pants along with the slightly cheaper Tesla compression pants.<br />Here are some comparisons between the two.<br />1) Far more comfortable. They feel like they are made of a much higher quality<br />2) I used these mostly on leg days and had no problem with them sliding down. I had to pull the Tesla comps up after every set.<br />3) Could be the Placebo effect but it seemed as if they did indeed help in recovery and my legs felt great after I pulled them off.<br />Overall, I'm happy with the price and performance. Will buy more.
B008VWOQQS|5|great quality. smooth and soft. one of the best buys we had.<br />looks beautiful on our girl. just a little expensive .
B009MJ5QK4|5|I thought maybe after a week off these wouldn't fit, but they're still just fine...
B005F5S4P8|2|Straight out of the package the deerskin seemed to be very dry and was shedding small grains of leather. It took about an hour for the grains of deerskin to stop coming off the palms of the gloves. The second day I noticed a split/tear in the deerskin on the backside of the middle fingertip. Since there is a thick mesh backing under the deerskin, the split isn't much of a concern, more of a worry about the overall quality of Caiman gloves. The gloves are rather comfortable but I expected a lot more as I have only worn them for about 10hours over two days. One day at work indoors, where they were a bit warm but breathable, and once outside for a few hours. So far they're nothing special.<br /><br />  In the past I have tried several brands of synthetic and natural leather gloves and as of now these are no better than average. Most of my gloves last a couple of months since I work with my hands almost everyday. As long as the palm side of the gloves last a long time I would consider buying another pair but at this rate I have serious doubts about their durability. Be sure to find these gloves for cheap otherwise they may not be worth your money.
B004GNIBBM|4|Was just what I have been needing , after a failed attempt  of reconstruction after mascetomy. They look and feel real price was great!
B0093GOKJ4|5|Great looking, really comfy. They run on the longer side which is fine by me at 5'8&#34;.  They are a nice cool light pant for summer
B00YBEDZ30|5|Fit as expected. I love the light pink color and used this the following day . Nice fabric quality and was thankful to receive this with a discount in exchange of my honest , unbiased review.
B00T3ELSHI|4|I love my dress I was very satisfied with it an also was beautiful.
B007ABR212|1|I am a Romany woman (ethnically Gypsy, with ancestors originally from India), and I see now that I have been dressing wrong my entire life. Whether I have honored the modest, whole-leg-covering skirts of my ancestors or worn the suits of my current profession, I am not being authentic OR mystic despite the fact that I speak Romani, an Indic language, fluently. Please, dear White non-Roma, show me how I must look, act and be so that I may fit your image of my people in the future. May we always be as sexy, mysterious, suspicious, and/or nonexistent as you need us to be. I love being reduced to a stereotype.
B00DIH7WIA|4|This dress fits true to size and can be worn with both flats and heels. The cut is nice and elegant and the color is very 'in' right now. Happy with my purchase!
B00AB85PHO|1|I bought these initially back in the 1980's and they were the best thing ever as I run very cold all of the time.  This undershirt was the answer to my problem of being cold no matter how many layers I wore.  But, I recently discovered that there were significant changes made to this once well designed garment.  They shortened the length of the v-neck and made it less wide at the shoulders with the result that I can no longer wear them under my v-neck tops or dresses as the neckline now shows.  What a stupid thing to do.  They fixed something that wasn't broken.  I can buy less expensive versions of this that closely approximates the style rather than waste money on this redesigned product.  It was perfect and now it's ruined.
B00HRN9T7I|5|Stylish and chic trench coat at a great price.
B00JCZ2JXA|4|Just received belt and changed to my buckle. the belt seems to be as described but certainly not of the quality of of belts i had in the past. i don't know how it will wear but i suspect not like the older ones
B00DUYUER2|5|buena
B00B4WQIAE|4|The color, size and the cut is perfect, but I didn't realize the fabric was shinning and very clingy. You might need to wear a slip under.
B00C3X6NFI|1|I ordered according to the size guide and I was swimming in these pants. sent them back. not a happy camper
B007FW0FT2|3|The lace is very very fragile and is already shredding after one wash. Also you can't wear any underwear under it, the material is extreamly thin. Any body imperfections show right through. But the are very beautiful. If you have a butt at all (I do) the pants sag while you walk.
B00NI4A2P8|5|Excellent. Good material and quality. Recommended!
B00JRUP5CC|4|Nice fit.
B00HJ9RXEG|5|Loved the shirt it fit perfect and made my night even better
B00C1C0IPC|5|i mean, it is french connection, and they know what they're doing. i like the style and the material - such quality. you must get it.
B000NRV702|2|The small belt isn't 39 inches it's barely 34. if your wast is anywhere near 32'' get a medium or large
B004TE2AYC|5|We LOVED these while they fit our little one and were so sad when he outgrew them!  Can't wait to bring them back out for the next baby.  They always washed well and will look practically new when we use them as hand-me-downs.  Adorable!!!!
B0071MEX8K|5|It's comfortable and I enjoy it but I bought it too small my breastfeeding counselor advised me to buy a bigger cup since my breast  are creating too much milk to fit in the size I got
B0018ONA7C|5|Very easy shopping. I'm familiar with the pants so it's just a matter of price and convenience.<br />Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store, finding out they don't have the 517 in my size and driving back home. I've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier. The pants themselves are everything they've always been, good fitting and tough.<br />It's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I don't look the same every day.<br />I was upprised how fast they came and that's a big plus too.
B005CLLT2K|5|Umm so dose this play the song like in pandor hearts or not??
B00377PAJE|5|I purchased for my niece. She is overweight and I thought these would smooth out &#34;the lumps.&#34;  Most heavy women put pants over regular cotton panties and their butt looks dimpled. Now she looks put together. Just my opinion.
B007QB4QJ2|4|One of the few brands that carries my size and this fits perfectly.
B000TJNDCO|2|Not the same color, no the same quality , my mum bought it for me and now we are out of us, no chance for return.!!
B009CDISUA|3|These socks are not what I expected but I gave them to my daughter and she likes them.  So that saves me some money.
B00K5ODASU|4|I read the reviews about these running small so I ordered my 24-month old a 3T and they fit well. I think a 4T would have been even better to give a little room to grow, but I realize Jammie's are supposed to fit snugly.
B002U0KKY4|5|Got these last week and I couldn't be more pleased.  Hands down the best pair of underwear I've ever owned.  I will buy 6 more so that I can wear a pair every day of the week.
B006L6DZC2|3|Somewhat large
B00LMZJ3QO|1|Stopped workin n not a proper month yet
B007NOEWV4|5|I use this case to hold the gas credit cards in the console of my truck. It keeps the cards nicely organized and protected from dirt and damage. It has a high quality finish and appearance and is pleasant to use.  Nice product.
B00X4YVX3M|5|This tank was surprisingly soft and comfortable for the very affordable price!<br />It is true to size, was just as described and did not warp after being washed. Very pleased!
B00JE8P1NK|5|Bought this for July 4th and got tons of compliments. I've already worn it again. It's very comfortable and fits as expected. I don't understand the other reviewer's one star review. Don't think that's warranted. I own a ton of Lucky Brand clothes and have never been disappointed yet!
B002DYY1BK|5|Hat was perfect. I couldn't have picked a better one myself.  We sent the first one back as it wasn't a good product.  However amazon made it right and I am very happy with it!'
B00BM8IVUA|2|They don't fit very well. I'm returning them..I expected mire from this brand..I'm disappointed.maybe next time..but not this pair...sorry! Ok
B00CIBCJA8|4|I ordered the white/teal/gray scarf and was really amazed at how fast I received it, less than a week. What I love about it is that it's a really light weight and sheer scarf so wearing it with a fitted tee and a pair of shorts in the September heat in the south was perfect. It does actually appear more sheer than the pic shows. I received a few compliments on it at work the first day I wore it. I love scarves but hate the heavy feeling around my neck most scarves have but this is absolutely perfect. The only thing I would improve is the quality of the stitching at the seams. But it is just a light scarf so it won't be taking any tension or stress to it. Love!
B005V1ZHCY|4|I just got my shirts today. Delivery was fast. Ordered them on Thursday or Friday, and got them on Monday. The fit was kinda bigger than expected (I ordered a large). But overall I am happy
B002R0FP88|5|Great coat
B00LGCQSRA|4|very nice dress, I should have ordered one size bigger...
B00VG8HRJM|1|The shirt was dirty had water marks all over it and smelled like mildew.
B0042D6M76|4|This bra really does 'cling on' to you, but maybe too much! The first time I wore it the plastic grippy lines cut me!<br /><br />I do like that I don't have to worry about it slipping but it's a little too stiff for my preference.
B00GNQR6CA|5|This is such a great product I'm kind of bummed they're running low on stock and don't have more colors. Fits close to the body but not tight: the perfect fit to have under a polo or shirt, where you don't want bulk. Hope there's more stock soon!
B00X7CK742|1|It was tore in two places was very big do not like
B0099AB092|4|Is a good product and good service
B00A85Z1XS|4|My teenage daughter likes this although the ears do not stand up as well as in the picture.
B00801Q03W|2|Short and wide
B00EE30EP0|4|This one has square holes and is a little too long. But it was easy to cut a half inch off with a band saw and drill new holes. It is working just fine.
B008XG2DLC|5|I am 5'8&#34; tall, 124 lbs with a 35&#34; chest.  I bought the MEDIUM and it's perfect!  If my chest were larger or my weight were 130+, I couldn't see fitting into a MEDIUM anymore.<br />The sleeves go all the way down to my wrists which is tough to find for me without getting a bigger (baggy) size.
B00EMG3YJW|5|cute socks!
B00H7XGM6O|5|Nice
B00GIIOXMO|4|I like it
B00LRF2H80|5|It fit me perfectly and is very comfortable.<br />I have no complaints about this tank top!!
B00MQSLE8Q|5|Awesome product
B00LHUEFEO|4|I like the color!
B00HK0WV1Y|4|Very light and comfy to wear. Perfect for summer. Your belly might be showing for its a little shorter in length.im 5'1\\" and99lbs. But its really cute. I'll recommend it.
B00J40MTGK|5|Great on the little girl (3 years old) who I bought it for.
B00505DW3C|5|Gift for niece. Fits perfectly.  She is very excited to wear it back to school.
B003D835TE|5|i got it for my 10yrs old son who's a little husky, a lil big but fits great! quality is great and im really happy with my buy
B001GQ84ZU|4|The ears dont stand up on their own.  I filled them with foam surrounding chop sticks.  That worked for me.
B00URCZJXO|5|Fits perfectly and the design is bad ass!
B00AAJ66PO|5|Great buy.
B00C3X7KL4|5|this top was beautiful but i wore out the part of the sleeve where my elbow went but i have bony elbows and do that to all my tops
B00NOFLB6U|2|Color was way different than in photo.
B00KBX4LUG|4|no complaints, fits true to its size.
B002H0F24K|5|The color on this one did wash well in cold water.
B003XKEOCE|5|Wonderfu product.
B002QGN2HO|3|However after I wiggle into it and put it on just right it serves the purpose intended. Now if not worn properly an imprint on the thighs will be obvious and I prefer no panties underneath. I notice the more I wear the more it stretches to fit my body and I am 5'7 and all of a 2x and it's a tight fit but it works.
B0045X807I|1|stupid hoodie.<br />I dont understand why anyone would think making this is was a good idea.<br />Straight edge is against sex and drugs.
B00EPDXRRQ|1|Hate them .. waste of money<br />Don't buy
B002HJ377A|5|I purchased this as a gift, but decided to wear it a day to try it out: it is a powerful shirt! I set the shirt out the night before: when I woke up in the morning, my wife thanked me for making out with her in her dream. (Hey, when you get older, sometimes dreaming of intimacy is better than the real thing!) Then, I went to a business to pick up an item. While waiting to be helped, a very attractive lady ignored me while she talked on the phone with another customer. This is a huge improvement, as very attractive females typically ignore me without any pretense at helping someone else! Thank you, Three Wolf Moon shirt!
B002HJ3DDI|5|These FLAT knit knee socks are the ONLY mostly-cotton knee socks I've ever found that STAY UP! I have owned a few pair of these for several years (3-4) and those pairs still stay up. I must admit to only wearing them about 5 months a year, in the summer.  But I wear dresses, and so I wear them every day.  Two socks of my older pairs got a tiny hole by my big toe nail, but I did a quick stitch-up and they have held up beautifully.  Colors are good and socks not a bad price either, so I bought several more pair to last me for future years.
B00KFAWKYO|5|Great quality
B00LWHWPBW|5|Fits snug yet not too tight. will use it hunting this fall. Then I'll really know how great it functioned.
B00K680W1S|5|Loved it.  Thank you.  One or the few times where i found cloths on amazon that actually fit true to size.  All of my orders actually this hole week fit great.  Thanks
B008I1ACXI|1|Too small
B00G570LGA|5|Exceptional product!
B00SLZZRJU|5|This product is really great for Spring and Summer look. It is very thin that the air goes through in and out, so it is very comfortable and stylish.<br />It matches with any shirt, jacket, and etc. The shipping was fast the quality is awesome.
B000JUT8A4|3|Smaller than I expected but there wasn't an XXL option for selection. The sleeves were a little longer than I prefer- I thought this would be more like a baby T or fitted design.  It did not shrink much but after one wash I did notice a bit of fraying on one side shoulder seam I need to sew up. (or not). Somewhat of a disappointment but that is just my opinion.
B007GMPTDS|5|Scarf was exactly as pictured.  I was trying to it match with existing clothing and it turned out perfectly.  I loved the color, length, fabric, and texture.
B00HY3MQAS|5|Love it
B00REGDAZK|5|Great pair of jeans good quality!
B008CGWT7Q|4|This is a slim fit shirt so I don't like it. But I love the design!
B00F8Q0LOG|5|I ordered this tank top to wear in a Strides Against Breast Cancer walk. It fit great, was comfortable and quality made.
B00KRC3472|5|I bit smaller than I thought but still in love with this!!
B0013CBZ9E|5|Fits perfect, I am short so I knew they would be a bit long. The pockets are great to hold all my gear when I'm crafting (Sewing, crochet, painting, yard work, lol) They are my go-to &#34;I have things to do and need pockets and I like to wear comfortable stylish (for me) clothing whilst I do&#34; pants.
B000UXFJWQ|5|I was honestly a bit skeptical on buying this jacket online, since I prefer to see things in person before I buy them so that I can get a good idea of their quality (and I've never heard of Weatherproof before). But I needed a new jacket and figured for the price, even if it was cheap quality, it would be OK. I just received it and I was actually really surprised with the quality and style. I got one in black, and it is not cheap looking, and is fairly warm. It doesn't have the look of a leather or microsuede jacket, but I didn't expect it to, since it is water-resistant. At the same time, it doesn't have a cheap plastic look to it either. It is something I could wear going to the mountains or to dinner. I don't think I will use all the pockets it has on the inside, but since they are on the inside they are not a distraction. I am very pleased with this product.
B001V5JEH8|2|Once upon a time you could depend on Dockers but along the way something has happened and It's not good...They have so many countries producing their products that you never know what you're going to receive from them anymore....Their new product lines may appeal to the very young but they are certainly a turn off for the more 'mature' among us.....
B00PG7RBOA|5|Love it
B004BDOPUS|5|Great for the summer and I had to reorder one size up because the size chart is a bit off.
B0081P6PPK|5|Totally awesome
B00OEF4K26|4|I really like that dress the only thing that i don't like is that it's made of thin material so you have to wear somekind of underskirt or something. Other then that it's very cute dress. Fit as expected. :)
B00080L00Q|4|HANDSOME CARRIER FOR SHAVING ACCESSORIES AND/OR TOILETRIES. APPEARS WELL MADE.
B00ITO1OWM|3|EXCELENTE..
B0036ZFV8W|3|I gave one to my grandson.  They are a little short for him..but will work around the house.  Or outside the house.
B001OG3XN0|5|These are great shirts.  However, be aware that if you are going to put them in a dryer, buty the next size larger than what you normally wear.  They will shrink even at the coolest settings.  If you air dry them, they may need a cool irone touch up if you're going to wear it to a formal event.  Otherwise, enjoy!!<br />Dewell Garner.
B0089GNJVO|4|This is a nice, quality shirt so it should have 5 stars. However, the sizing is way off. It says Boys 2-7 so I went off their sizing chart and ordered a Large (I have a 5 year old that wears a 5/6). I received the shirt and it does say it is a large, but it is huge. Luckily, I also have a 9 year old son and it fits him perfectly so I would say the Large size is more like a size 12/14. I am going to order another one since it is a great price and I can't find Puma shirts in his size in the stores around here. I really wanted this as a Christmas present for him since he ruined his last Puma shirt and it was his favorite. Oh well, better late than never. I will update this later when we get the small size to see if it fits.<br />UPDATE: I ordered the small size and it is definitely too big also. It is at least a size 8 boys. It is very baggy on my son that wears a 5/6.
B00WJN48B8|5|This product does run a little small but the quality is very good and they had excellent customer service with my exchange...will definitely purchase from this seller again
B00F3DP1SK|5|I was a little surprised that I ordered large,extra large and they sent me xxl and IT still fit I'm usually size medium  but color is good very silky
B00CDLE3NE|5|Once again quite a fancy top that dresses up an outfit
B005PQXCFE|4|fits well, better than I would have thought. Price ok. Repels spilt beer very well.
B002WJE620|2|No support. The back rides up and the front buckles under below the breast line.
B00DVN0J5E|1|Poor quality and very uncomfortable. It rides up and it is really hot if you want to wear it under a dress. I returned it and found better quality at Walmart.
B004P376S2|1|Poor quality
B007KAQAHU|5|Feels nice and is slim fitting. Definitely better quality than a 2-3 pack of tank tops for the same price, if you go for quality over quantity.<br /><br />I bought this to go running in. At first I thought it was very long, well below the waistline, but figured out that's to prevent it riding up. Good for workouts, bad for wearing under anything else as it's very long.
B002OB429I|5|Was in my wish list for a year and then it went on sale. I ordered another for when the first one wears out, which looks like it wont be quick. Quality made, and cards and cash are easily accessible. License is hard to retrieve from clear sleeve but rarely have to so not an issue.
B00T71JIF6|5|Lovely dress!<br />Skims your body...if you have major imperfections this is not a dress you would want.<br />Great fabric too.
B00FBD2G0I|5|Very comfortable, just what I expected.  Pleased
B00807HIX2|5|The four inch deep crown is too big for my head but the hat is well made and is a nice light grey color.  If you have a big head, this hat will fit you much better
B009YRMZVM|4|This bra, unlike many others I've recently tried, is smooth and comfortable. The straps are not adjustable, which I was afraid would be a problem (I have really small shoulders so I usually have to tighten up bra straps quite a bit), but the fit was fine as is. I highly recommend this bra for casual, at home evenings and weekends.
B00GNU1AFA|1|I ordered this because im a big big chested woman and i need a sports bra to job. I was unaware that the size chart is NOT fit for US standards. I ordered a size LARGER than i normally would just to be safe. Welll it didnt fit.. It was so small i couldnt even get it on! The fabric wasnt stretchy at all and i couldnt get it past my shoulders. Im not the skinniest person in the world but my 7 yr old put it on of course it covered her whole torso but it was TIGHT on her!!
B00CAUYCIE|4|This jacket was what I was expecting.  But as a woman with large arms there is not a lot of room in the arms.  The jacket does have a little give so it does stretch.  The arm issue is my only concern.
B00T5GNE8K|3|ok
B00P1NB2VC|5|So cute and so soft. Softest socks ive ever felt in my life.
B0064OC716|5|See Through!  If you can't tell by the picture these are pretty transparent, buy these if you don't mind showing your stuff.  Having said that... they are very nice fitting and feel very good while wearing.  Good product.
B0071P71CM|5|Not much to say - it's a hat.  Our 4 month old hates having the sun in her eyes so we got this to help and it does it's job - it keeps the sun out of her eyes.<br /><br />Wonderful seller!! (Quidsi Retail LLC (Diapers.com))  I ordered this in the evening on a Friday & it said 2 day shipping (only choice).  I figured that meant business days so we'd see it Tuesday, or maybe Wednesday.  Saturday morning it arrived via FedEx.  So happy!
B00DNVIPSM|5|One of my favorite dresses! Perfect for so many occasions! I am hoping to buy another in a different color.
B00LAGESEC|5|I bought two of these for my daughter. She says they are comfortable. The fit runs a little bit large, but overall looks great.
B00G9HUGM0|5|This wallet has been one of my own person best. It has plenty of space to hold all the cards that you get from every store. The two sections allows me to keep money and debit cards separate. I was originally worried that my license would fall out of the ID slot but has been working great. I will definitely would recommend this product to anyone.
B00GAZIE2K|5|Very comfortable and the straps actually stay on my shoulders.  I haven't worn a front close bra in years.  Now that's all I'm going to order.
B00ISKG5QW|5|My baby did not cry or was uncomfortable after wearing them so I guess they serve the purpose. I love the color and the color did not fade after multiple washes. Highly recommend this product.
B00SFEWR2W|5|Perfect fit
B00D2GF4QY|5|I am very happy with my purchase
B001F3WZHM|3|nuff said
B00817DYUM|5|They're pretty comfortable.
B007WHW5KW|5|True To Size
B00KBRHHY4|5|This shirt is awesome! My husband loves it!
B004IAIK9Q|1|Don't do anything and weren't like picture these are more for bathing suits
B00M1ID0J2|1|Ordered XL and is a small at most. The quality is not good. The lace is some sort of cotton and tangles up. The stitching was not straight and had threads hanging. Give the item away. It looks like a child's shawl not an adult. Not a shawl though but has sewed in sleeves to make a blouse.
B009LPUSES|3|Mine was a size medium not a large and small for a sized medium.
B00OI002N8|3|Extremely soft. But the size is a bit small by other standards. More like  3X than a 4X.
B001CP258W|5|My grandson loved it. It was perfect.
B0093KU4WM|3|Quality is pretty poor on this especially the lacing there are better options you can find for around the same price.
B005GYGF5E|5|Very good quality, very nice fit.  Reviews that other buyers posted were very helpful.  In fact, the reviews are what I go by, not just the product description.  They tell you pretty much everything you need to know, and there are no surprises.
B001JBNDL2|5|Excellent
B00LMKERHO|3|smallest than I expected
B0061IDXPO|5|I'm 30 and have three kids. Needless to say, I have some body issues (my stomach is sad). This suit is very flattering and disguises my skin belt wonderfully. Highly recommend!<br /><br />The only problem I had was that I ordered a size 10 because it was said to run small. When I got the size 10 suit it was too big so I had to return it. That was a bummer because I felt like the first one was delivered by Paul Revere; it took forever. But the returns process is super easy and it came much more quickly the second time.
B00MUVFHCI|5|Love this dress. Usually I'm a size 12 and it fits perfectly. Lovelier looking than the picture and very flattering
B001D0VHAI|5|She raves that these have made it(tummy with 3rd baby in it) so much more comfy.  I would say that if you dont want your wife to be all cranky when your out and about get her a few pairs of these undies.  Money well spent.
B000783Q4M|4|Great material and color was exactly what I wanted. However the bottom of hoodie was not like a stretch band . It was very loose . I guess  when you buy that BIG it suppose to be that way. The picture that they show when buying must be of a regular size xl, L, or medium.
B00OBSHPXM|4|comfortable
B009XB61K0|5|Belt IS Reversible, I just had to pull the fastener and twist, it should come with instructions. I like it.
B00FQQYIBU|5|Very nice and well made
B00GN7Y0JG|4|Four starts because the quality of the material is good, the length is as shown in the picture. Missed on one star because the neck design and the sleeve were different from what is shown in the picture.
B000KYR7A2|5|Awesome coat!
B0043610CO|5|Nice quality for the price and fits perfect.  Ribbon for a tie so it looks sleek.
B0060JJMNG|5|Great product
B000V6Y2ZM|5|Great product for the price. I ordered the &#34;recommended&#34; skirt that goes under since i am quite tall. The costume is pretty great for the amount paid.
B00CEY2U8A|5|Getting the robe was a good buy, it fits very well and feels soft. It has pockets and reaches about mid calf, perfect for wearing and the flower design is very pretty, a real nice robe I can put it on and relax in the mornings and afternoons.
B0094KRHWQ|5|This was a gift for mom, but she loves it and appreciates the roomy / flowing nature of the design.
B006NVTVP0|5|Great product, nice soft fabric, looking forward to see my daughter wearing it. I bought 18 months for my daughter who is 9 months old, the brand is on a smaller size
B00DD29GF2|3|Nice shirt but impossible to keep from wrinkling whether dry cleaned or hand washed. I am of average build with 36B's and the buttons gap a little over my chest with a size L. Just a bit on the small side.
B000SDGEAE|5|This is a nice sling backpack with multiple pockets. The main compartment is large enough for a couple of college textbooks and a small binder. The  mp3 pocket is spacious but the pouch for the radio/ipod holder isn't large enough for the Ipod Video.  There are two accessory sections, one on the back and another underneath that section. These two sections can hold a cellphone, calculator, pencils/pens, flash drives, and keys (there's a loop especially for keys!). The side mesh pocket holds my vitamin water bottle perfectly. I like the elastic trim on the pocket because it secures the bottle. The padded strap that goes across the chest is comfortable. I especially like the the pocket across the chest (zip closure) which holds cell phone and coin purse. If you're looking for a smaller backpack that can satisfy many functions and hold most of the items you'd need throughout the day, then you should be happy with this one.  It has straps which wrap around the waist.  These also tuck up into secret \\"pockets\\" when not in use so they don't dangle and get in the way. Samsonite really has thought of everything with this bag.
B00OAN7IYE|2|The size medium was definitely too small for an average C cup if you want to feel secure for any type of swimming
B00A65MXWM|3|it fits well just very cheap. looks like it was hand painted in some areas . I wasn't mad though it was not costly so I can live with this
B00DW7MB9Q|4|It's good but it runs a little bit larger than i thought. I probably should bought it smaller
B00CJOFYTM|4|pretty but little small for me but I love it. nice print very cute . love it  and good price.
B000LXB6FY|5|My son loved his new snowboarding socks. Thank you.
B00M0EMUKW|5|Really nice looking tie :) package arrived in time as well.
B006VY4S1Q|5|This shirt is awesome!  After almost a year of owning it, it still looks brand new and is extremely comfortable.  The seller was quick to ship the product.
B00A8F86J4|5|I love the pleated styling of this jacket. I ordered a small, and will have to move the buttons slightly as its a tad small. It fits everywhere else, and I think it would have been too wide in the shoulders and too long in the arms if I had ordered a larger size.
B00EK5ZP2O|5|perfect thanks
B0009MM372|5|working on third season - husband does heavy plumbing work
B00EWKBNHI|5|This is by far the best PUMA shirt I have purchased and I am a huge PUMA fan.  As a matter of fact everyone has been trying to take my shirt.  It's different yet support a worthy cause, which is why I brought it.  It fits as expected.  It's not too tight or too big!!!
B000A38CGG|5|Another great purchase from Wrangler.<br />Fit good, not to long in the length.<br />Very warm.
B00HLSRNL8|5|I was quite impressed with the color and quality of the bow tie and suspenders given their very low price on amazon. They fit all of my groomsmen, who each were of various sizes and builds. They seemed to last through an evening of dancing without falling apart, and I imagine they could be worn again someday for costume or special occasion.
B00AMA900O|5|Great quality. Fit perfect on my 4 year old.
B00NYIZGMC|5|I'm a 5'10&#34; somewhat slender male and the large fits great... yes its very very spacious, and the crotch hangs super low, but the sleeves and legs fit perfectly.  The fabric isn't super thick and very comfy, which is great as I plan to dance and dance and dance and dance and dance in it and I expect it not to get super hot.
B00ICO9E44|5|My daughter loves this dress and wanted to twirl in it as soon as I put it on her. Very cute and a great purchase. The dress is slightly more orange than it appears on the screen, but very nice.
B00AEYY2YW|4|a gift to my musician friend--he loved it! Check out the other designs..the only minus, it's ships from Singapore and took longer than I predicted.
B009S2HJFK|4|I opened the package and LAUGHED! My wife and daughter are both very slim and tall. They usually wear an extra small. The reason for my laughter is these shirts would not even fit my six year old niece! The sizes should be UTD or SPECIFIED!  STILL LAUGHING! seriously I NEED to know how to exchange these shirts. On the UPSIDE they are AWESOME & My gals LOVE them! Please REPLY ASAP Thank you
B00EDTN2HC|4|Really comfy!
B002N31I7Q|1|I was really disappointed when I got these because they were way too tight around my legs. I'm not a small lady, but these socks should fit, I'm about 140 pds and 5'3... They do stretch but it makes the material look cheap, and they don't stay up.
B0027P9Z6G|2|The title of this item said small/ medium, but when it was purchased there was a drop down menu to choose a size. I thought that you could choose the size from there. I chose a large/x-large but a small/medium was shipped to me and it was too small. It was still worn, but it would be nice if there were no conflicting options.
B00D8ERPXK|5|Just as expected. Looks like what picture looks like online and fits as listed. Nice product.
B007U3F0U0|4|My 3 year old son wanted the whole family to go as skeletons for Halloween this year.  This worked great for me to fit that request and we were a hit as a family.  The print on the sweater is good although I would not recommend running through the dryer.  Works perfect for an occasional wear on Halloween etc.
B00KNMW0CQ|5|These where a perfect fit, great color,and extremely comfortable and came eatlier than expected
B0064EYHQ4|4|Love them as much as you can love panty hose :)<br />Glad to find them online will continue to purchase as needed.
B008I6V4IA|4|These wings turn heads. They aren't built to last forever, but they will last you longer than one night. They have an adequate amount of feathers and they are visible from front and back. They are quite affordable as well. I don't have buyers remorse.
B004K2EKF0|5|They are perfect for the outfit I bought them for!
B00IJQEUUS|5|I'm 5' 8'' and 130lbs and a 6 fit perfectly. It is good quality and arrived on time.
B00OV3H410|5|Excellent.
B0096NBXMG|5|Terrifically warm and cozy for the winter months. The fit is normal and they do not sag. I will definitely buy them again!
B004AROJRY|3|It is lovely but little small.
B00P8X1X8W|2|I was very disappointed in the way the dress fit , it look too busty on me, it was not a smooth fit, the bust area was pertruding out too much
B00M9BIBW2|5|Great price, fit and quality
B00ARSIP4I|4|No small handle on top otherwise very good with many useful pockets and excellent looks together with the Forrest cotton duffle bag
B00AKFPOZQ|5|It came much quicker than it said it was going too, arrived in adorable packages and the little min pin looks great on my Sailor Moon satchel. The cloak though most of all was AMAZING and well worth the price. Mine was made well, super warm and fit me perfectly!! I even had some of my family and friends guess how much I paid for it and were surprised when I told them how much. Everywhere I go I've been complimented on it and it's perfect for going to cosplay conventions if you want to be pretty basic. I definitely recommend this seller. As a huge fan of Studio Ghibli films and growing on the movie My Neighbor Totoro especially, this is perfect for any fan out there.
B00HWR9960|4|This dress fits smoothly down the waist and over the hips.  Youthful, but modest.  I bought a size 8 when I usually buy a size 6.  This is because I am 60, and things have &#34;shifted&#34;, but otherwise the dress fits true to size.  I like the elbow sleeve and the boat neckline:  Looks great with a strand of pearls.  Fully lined is nice; but I wish the print was of a slightly higher quality.  I like this dress very much
B00QXHNSAS|5|great Item at a very good price. Would buy from this seller again.
B00SJ2MUNG|4|Wish it had side pockets, but still love them.
B00H1OTMOI|1|Not what is shown in the pic at all. The material is like a cheap suede kinda.
B006G7JXRM|5|This socks are great, they fit my babies feet just fine and go well with different kinds of shoes, I will definitely buy them again.
B00E0NUD50|3|You need a slip.
B00FJQQFFO|5|Love love love. Great price, light and pretty. I have several different colors and get lots of compliments on them.
B00APO9EL2|5|The L was sized a little small for me.  I didn't bother exchanging it for an XL and just got a refund instead.  I gave it 5 stars because Oneill is a cool company and I really like all the other shirts I have from them.
B00KU4DOZO|5|Good quality for price
B008MBNJZ2|5|Although I ordered this a while back, I can say my baby is now 2 years old and I still have this product lol I just can't through it away, when my baby was 6/7 months it was the best thing I've purchased!!! It kept her warm and it's so soft and snugly..I recommend this to any of my friends who are expecting or have a baby!!
B00A8LPNTY|5|Bought it for my daughter. It fit her iPad mini beautifully. Color was true to product photo. A nice looking, protective case.
B00W8FGAPE|5|Very nice sock. Does not bind at all and the material is not too thick.
B00IL5ROCS|4|expensive but nice.
B00C5EK9BY|5|Really like these shorts. working around house or playing. plenty of room and built for just about anything you wanna do in them. Just wish they came in more colors.
B00C2L82IC|5|These are my favorite scrubs I have ever owned.
B00T2WBJJ8|5|I really liked! 😍 I'm pregnant so I cant wait till used 😁 the delivery was fast thank you!!
B008P8MV3S|5|This top is so nice. It looks like a blouse I'd have paid a lot more for. I have another top from Patty and I have to say they are affordable, cool, classy, edgy and really comfortable. Whatever look you're going for, you should give these a try. I have a bunch in my cart just waiting for pay day! :)
B00J0TICRK|5|Wore it for the first time today! I'm in love. Perfect for spring weather.
B004S0KT68|5|Very nice quality and well made coat.  Stylish, true to size.  I am 5'10&#34; and 165-170 lbs and the medium was a perfect fit. Quite happy with this purchase.
B00D6Z09VG|5|Beautiful, soft, pretty colors. I recomend it
B0000BNGVL|5|My niece loved them!
B00CO8I378|3|Not great not terrible. Definitely run small
B00CDAYRT0|3|It's okay for some but there is no support in the breast area--it could at least have an underwire so that the breast don't droop.
B00487PKTM|5|I am well pleased with the mittens. They are just what I needed for driving my four wheel drive tractor while plowing snow.
B00CLYY2D4|5|One of my very favorite scarves!  I've worn it for ages and still love it.
B00EPMAIH4|1|Extremely small, sizes are no where near  true.
B00F4NCTV6|5|they are great
B001HS0AT0|5|Since I got this T -shirt and put it on I was happy, it fits just right, fills nice on my skin and very comfortable, highly recommended.
B000P15I5G|5|Fast shipping and great value!
B000SM94W0|1|There's a very good reason it was only $7. It's cheap cheap cheap. After wearing it 3 times it looks like it is a year old.
B00E0EHJDS|5|Was for daughter's graduation outfit.  Fit perfect.  Very happy
B002QB0UYW|5|Great fabric! The shirt comes out of the washer ready to wear and stayed nice looking all evening at an outdoor reception.
B00AFD6RF4|3|Got this as a gift for a 15 year old girl. I looked small and if nothing else it will be skin tight.
B00ATM9OW4|5|Great price for a silk tie.  Nice fabric and good colors.
B009UYOE86|5|Love the adjustability and the black under the brim of the visor.  Wicks very well and is great quality.  Thanks!
B00DRGJTI8|5|I got the black and grey pair for the gym and lounging. Gotta say that these are really cute and the material is not cheap despite the price. They look just as pictured and hug your body in a very flattering way.
B006SRTB9A|5|I've been sold on Duofold for 30 years and they have yet to let me down. I had 2 pair of one piece that i rotated and kept on for 3 months during the ski season.
B00B2HVBE4|5|My go to shirts
B00M7MN7KY|4|I just got this coat and I ordered a size 1-2 years. i received a size 8. Im going to call Amazon to get a replacement of the correct size. But, this coat is so darn cute and is made well. The lining is as cute as the coat…worth evert penny;
B009SL361C|5|These leggings are cute I'm 5&#34;10 184 pounds and they fit perfect...you have to try thing and yes they are a little see through
B0034S51SQ|5|I'm really happy with this necklace! The necklace is the perfect size even though the chain is a little longer than expected but it's still a good size. It's definitely perfect for anyone who loves the series!
B00MAOZ6D0|3|A little small in size with not alot of give....so order up a size. Although tight, I can still fit them. They are really cute and stylish. What I like most is how thin they are...si I can still wear them in warm weather.
B00LTTP2XQ|5|I love this shirt, I wish I had bought every color when it was on sale. Great value at regular price, but amazing value when I bough it on sale.<br />-True Fit<br />-Very attractive, I've gotten compliments from several people<br />-Well made<br />-Very Comfortable<br /><br />If you see it on sale buy all of them in your size!
B00V5B8PT6|5|Love them the color and fit were as expectided. The quality is awesome, thank you
B00KRC2LGC|5|The coat fits and looks like the picture.  It is a nice fall coat (to thin for NY winter) with a classy look.  No unexpected disappointments at all.  Fit good and doesn't have distorted length sleeves or short overall length like a lot of import coats.
B000O7L7WY|4|The Kenneth Cole belt was a very good quality.  The only problem with the belt was that there wasn't any instructions on how to reverse the belt to the other side(black to brown).  My husband still hasn't figured it out and he is very intelligent.
B009UZAE7U|4|I bought this because so many other clothes aren't made modest enough for me. It is a good cover, but maybe a little more material around the front underarm area would've been better.
B000MXINIQ|5|They fit well, stay cool and look nice. Great pants for a great price.
B0040NPFJ4|1|My order has been delayed 7 times!  Each time, on the day it is to arrive, I wake up to an email telling me it has been delayed yet again.  I've been planning to wear it this weekend since I ordered it a month ago.  I'm pretty sure it will be delayed again.  I'm thoroughly disappointed.
B00A6FN2K4|5|Terrific, nice and definitely not flimsy.  Got compliments and everyone was impressed with the fabric for white leggings.  Expensive, but would buy again.
B001LBKTQM|5|Good quality, I would buy it again! I kept one for me, and 2 were for presents. My aunt and my mother loved it!
B005KKB7DY|5|Great quality and simple to attach.
B003JTPIKG|5|perfect for 80's themed party, nice hot pink color
B00A5D96CU|4|This scarf is very soft and this pattern goes well with a casual outfit. It's long enough to easily wrap around once, and makes a great gift. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
B001RUVS5I|5|These fit perfectly no alts needed, I'm, 5'6&quot; weigh 145 and and size 8 is absolutely perfect...length and all. So comfy and so good looking. These are my go-to pants fro almost all occasions, work or dress up!
B00LWF0AYI|2|The graphic is faded. Not as clear and bright as pictured.
B00LXSBX6I|5|Quality is very good, I am very satisfied.
B00CI072RO|4|This is a beautiful dress but its rather short-waisted, wrinkles a bit easy and has some funky trim on 1/4 of neckline. Order a size up, get some spray sizing and remove the trim and you'll have a fabulous multi use dress.
B00E8GR7SA|4|I got this for an ugly sweater party...  However it was far to awesome to win... Over all a quality made sweater but fit a little on the small side.
B00J4E2VI2|3|I returned. It was a little small.
B00CT9TMM2|4|Nice soccer socks for my husband.  the length is good (up to the knee).  they are a little thin, but not a problem for him.  He can slip his shin guards in and off he goes to the soccer field.  Great price!
B001DNFAOO|5|This was actually used for a costume, but it was excellent quality.  Since it was so inexpensive I was expecting the material to look a little cheap and for the clasps to not be solid, but this far exceeded my expectations.  A great deal on a great tie!
B009IUH49S|5|well worth the money
B00DN1DAN2|5|I love pretty much anything that Dickies makes.  You can expect it to last.  These shirts are great in a hot kitchen, they breathe well and look awesome!!
B00DS5H5VQ|5|good
B00BB0TLNA|4|THESE ARE BIG! I normally wear a 27 in all jean brands. Every designer jean pretty much across the board. These are very big, I should have sent them back for a 26, maybe even 25, but I am going vacation and I wouldn't get the new ones in time. They are very comfortable. I am 5'8'', they hit a little above my ankle. I didn't measure the inseam, I plan on cuffing them anyways.
B00APV2OE4|5|I can't believe I'm publicly reviewing a bra.  I haven't decided if I'm going to blog about it.  I might, cause these are just that awesome.  Well anyway, I bought two of these this week on Amazon after I bought some in the store about a year ago.  These are the absolute best bras I have EVER worn.  Even after a year, they kept their support like no other bra I've ever had.  Now I'm going to get a bit personal here.  I'm quite the busty woman, and I have such a difficult time finding my size in stores.  I also have a difficult time finding bras, even in my size, that will keep me contained (ladies, you know what I'm talking about).  I personally think men design most bras, cause well, most of them are horrible.  This particular Bali bra is perfectly designed for us larger chested women.  I can mow the lawn, do landscaping in the hot sun, pull weeds, pick up my grandbaby, heck, I can even do jumping jacks, and my valuables are still safely tucked inside.  Oh ya, the designs on these are actually really cute, too -not old lady or hoochie mama looking.  I plan on buying more right now.  That's how awesome these are.
B00C4775SW|1|For the price I was very disappointed. I had expected to receive quality material for what I paid. I purchased 2 & I am sending them both back. The jacket material is Very thin, all the zippers are cheap, thin plastic. They just look & feel cheap. Had I paid 5 or 10 $ for them I would have no complaints, that is about the quality you are getting. These were purchased as a gift & I felt too embarrassed to give them to my children.
B001RMAAN2|5|I have owned this case and used it daily for work for over 6 years. It still,looks like new! I just bought an extra overstock unit from amazon for when my Orginal one wears out.<br /><br />Unfortunately Briggs&Riley has followed in the footsteps of companies like Tumi.<br /><br />Tumi and others have figured out that with an expensive \\"Status\\" name they can sell almost anything with their name on it.<br /><br />For instance you can buy a plain nylon travel toiletry bag worth $20.00 for Tumi now for $139.99!<br /><br />Briggs has done the same thing, nice plastic briefcases worth $39.99 for just $499!<br /><br />good Luck!
B00A8EFF9E|5|Very comfortable,  girls love em..... didn't shrink when laundering was worth the money, im very satisfied with my purchase thank you....
B008G17CQA|5|That hat is great  my brother and friends collect and wear hats daily  we are always looking for new and good quality  this was a great buy and I would recommend this to everyone
B0020B7VZO|4|I love the style 720 Full Figured Camisole Longline Bra. So I thought I would try other styles. This is much prettier than the style I normally wear but it doesn't have the perfect support the 720 does. All-i -all I am still satisfied with my purchase.
B005WSYSEY|1|Terrible!  First delivery was a girls night sleeper, which is not a large white pullover as shown above. They told me to keep it and they would send out the correct item. NOT.  Second shipment was the sweatshirt, but the size was incorrect. I asked for a large and got something a toddler could wear. Not even my ten year old could wear it. The tag that was attached to it said 14-16. Waste of time. They refunded the money because I didn't want to deal with them anymore. Pretty sad if you can't get one item correct.
B000BKPHY8|5|The gloves are the best.They fit perfect and have warmth along with control of steering wheel. I would buy no other brand.
B002QYO0IG|3|I have to admit, this is partially on me. I have no idea what my chest measurement is, but this sizing chart is absurd .&#34;Small-Medium? Sure, I'm lean, but I've got a highlander's chest and I'm tall enough not to trust a robe that fits small,&#34; I thought. I went to the customer reviews and was assured by comments like, &#34;On-size was too small, size-up fits great.&#34; I ordered the L-XL size and was immediately worried when my invoice marked it was just &#34;XL&#34;. I tried it on and, sure enough, I was swimming in the thing.<br /><br />The material itself felt awesome, but there was no way around it. I had to return it. There were no exchanges available and, by the time my refund when through, the price went up. My advice: don't even begin contemplating the &#34;large&#34; unless you're some mix of ripped/pudgy. You won't fit.
B00JK5RVOO|1|Only the cups are cotton. The rest seems to be nylon. On all the tags and labels, the content is in Chinese. Smells like chemicals.
B004QPJHYU|5|Simple but I wasn't looking for anything fancy, just something I could have with me when I'm out trooping. It has some issues holding business cards, but I'm wondering if the cards I have might be cut a little long...
B0041LIY9I|5|with a nw wallet, i have replacement windows, as they seem to fall apart before the wallet so the opportunity to be prepared.
B00857TH0O|5|I read the other reviews and ordered one size smaller than what I usually wear and this skirt fits great.  It is is comfortable and cute!  It is sized big and also stretches some, so definitely go with a smaller size that what you usually wear.
B00AG5VC7Y|5|I LIKE
