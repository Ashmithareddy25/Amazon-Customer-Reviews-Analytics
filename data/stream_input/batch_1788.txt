B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great way to make sure you get your zombie fix during the mid season break and before the next season is release on DVD/Blu-Ray.  My cable company only has three episodes online at one time and they expire.. nice to be able to go back and get my zombie fix whenever I want to.
B005KELWJY|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle Touch (sadly I don't have the Paperwhite) and I am pleased with it. The cover looks quite stylish and has been made very well. The straps hold my Kindle down securely and the front cover is plenty sturdy enough to protect my Kindle's screen while it's in my backpack. That alone is worth the price as the screen on my Kindle 3 didn't manage to survive my backpack without cracking. The magnetic strap thing that holds the front cover down well and pulls double duty by holding the cover in place behind the Kindle while I am using it. Also the inside cover has a sleeve that I put my hand in while I am using my Kindle which is handy during my commute to work on the train (I usually have to stand). Lastly, in my opinion the price of this cover is reasonable and is worth buying<br /><br />One note, if you are prone to dropping electronics often I would probably purchase a different case. I don't think the corners are sturdy enough to prevent possible screen breakage. This isn't a problem for me, but I thought it needed to be said. For how I use my Kindle this cover works fantastically and I'd fully recommend it.
0547884591|5.0|Everything you've come to expect from Tim Ferriss.  Definitely a book to be devoured in pieces - so much useful information.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I never saw the twists and turns coming with this book...loved every page! This is a great read and I will definitely be reading Gillian Flynn's other novels!
020530902X|5.0|This book contains great information. Very direct, but essential to any level of writing you might be at. Any of the 4 editions are useful however this current one relates to the times now. From the writer of Charlotte's Web.
0061478784|5.0|As much as I love the movie this book is just simply amazing, it's so beautifully written and I couldn't put it down, if you haven't read it yet, it's about time you do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is so amazing i reccomend this book ro every one!!! its sad the idea of kids killing each other but its amazing
B00365EVWE|3.0|I was very impressed with the bass, but my main gripe is that there is a TON of distortion especially in the mid/highs. So to start off for this review, all of my music is in FLAC format and I use a Fiio e10 DAC which doesn't matter as much for small earbuds as they don't require the power to drive like a full sized set, but it does put different headphones on an even playing field with low distortion amplification.<br /><br />Plain and simple, music with these get muddy and it ruins the sound. As mentioned above there is heavy distortion in the mid/highs. Especially in the vocals in all genres, the \\"t\\" \\"s\\" \\"ff\\" sound are produced with that terrible distortion \\"hiss\\" that poor quality speakers replicate. Other than the distortion, I found the treble quite \\"sharp\\" and that grew fatiguing. Even with the large amount of bass, the mids were recessed enough that it was just tiring.I am not sure if these are real or knock off's, but if these were really $180 headphones at one time it's very possible they are knockoff's with a \\"somewhat decent\\" sound. They aren't bad, but these are simply not that great as in the description. There is a reason you can't find much info about them online. I have been significantly happier with my Klipsch S4's; more comfortable and significantly better sounding.
B000002U88|5.0|Bob Seger Rocks.Excellent quality and sound.  Bob Seger always is excellent.  This cd surpassed the expectations.  The price was right, too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! It is easy to use and love the absolute variety of thing to explore. This one of my favorite apps on my Kindel Fire.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|Worst film I have seen in a long time.<br />It should have a warning that it only suitable for children under 12.<br />It was completely brain dead entertainment for anyone over that age.
0547884591|5.0|This book is awesome, not only do you learn how to become a chef and appreciate all the nuances of food to it's fullest, it also gets you on your way to improve the quality of LIFE in general. I think Tim's done it again, he wrote the best book this year!
0761171703|5.0|I first discovered Jordan Matter's work when a friend emailed a link to his website-- amazing!  I have been waiting for the book since then and it doesn't disappoint.  It's very affordable.  Hopefully there will be more volumes to follow.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had never seen Les Miserables but after seeing this production of public television I wanted to see it in person. This DVD is wonderful.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|I used to watch the 917s & 512s do battle at Watkins Glen Six Hour Endurance/Can Am weekends. Brought back many memories!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Spider solitaire is a classic favorite that I can't seem to stop going back to again and again.  Great classic game!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I would say: Chris Evans/Steve Rogers/Captain America...that's pretty much all you need.  But as an added bonus--you get Thor and Iron Man.  Drool drool.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read much of Stephen King but this subject (Kennedy assassination) has always interested me. The story grabbed ahold of me and wouldn't let go until I was done.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Have had the bag for about a month now.  Seems to be holding up very well.  My two camera bodies, a couple of lenses, and a few accessories fit just fine.  Overall the bag is great.  Would definetely recommend
B0022Y570K|5.0|A friend of mine just tunred me onto Volbeat a few months ago (I know - a little late) and I am so glad she did. &#34;Solid&#34; is the word that keeps popping into my head when thinking how to describe this album. Great lyrics, perfect blend of voice and heavy guitar and a great pace. Just love it!
B00001W9G0|5.0|This movie is a classic.  Loved it all again and again.  Barbra and Robert are such great actors they way the mesh is wonderful.
B00006JIA4|5.0|This was just an egotistical purchase, I guess the same as I'd view the singer, just plain egotistical from a rather dated culture. That's what happens when one grows up in a decadent society ;)
0547884591|4.0|I pre-ordered this book because I really enjoyed the previous 2.  And 4 hour Chef has surpassed my expectation!  I am no-where near complete just yet (although I have bitten off a sizeable chunk thus far.)  Can't wait to start cooking again, and keeping it simple.  I love that Tim has uncovered the fact that the true professionals have mastered the fundamentals.  To create a 1-page document that covers the rules (the basics) of any skill demonstrates true mastery.  If you understand, you can explain it simply.  If a so-called 'master' gives a complicated approach to what they do, they have not mastered or fully understood what it is that they do.<br /><br />Why the 4-star rating you say?<br /><br />(besides, in doing Amazon research, the 1 and 5 star ratings are a write-off anyways, right?)<br /><br />I felt certain sections so far were a bit of a tangent.  I know you demonstrate you point with examples, yet as I would get sunk into an example, next, i would get pulled back into the original task at hand.  The book can also be read non-linear as well (which I do enjoy as well) so perhaps I should create a game-plan of what it is exactly I would like to pull from the book.<br /><br />All in all, keep writing Tim.  Actually, keep living and experimenting.  As you create more content, you writing style could suck (it doesn't) and you would still add tremendous value to everyone who reads and applies what you teach.<br /><br />Your experience and exploits are a constant reminder for me to keep living and pursuing my dreams.  For that, I thank you.
0062209035|5.0|Ties Angeles games and Shadow of The Wind together. Can't wait for the 4th book. Highly recommend this to Zaffon readers.
0547884591|4.0|I have been following Timothy Ferriss since the early days of the 4 Hour Work Week.  I believe that nothing will top 4HWW in terms of changing my view of the world around me.  But 4 Hour Chef gives it its best shot.<br /><br />The 4 Hour Chef (4HC), much like its predecessor the 4 Hour Body (4HB), allows the reader to pick and choose the sections of the book that they want to consume or read.  Unlike 4HB however 4HC gradually introduces the reader to more difficult techniques and recipes by laying a solid cooking fundamentals (even though some are less orthodox than some would like).  I know how to cook and this book allowed me to quickly peruse the easier recipes at the beginning of the book and jump ahead to the WILD, SCIENCE and PRO recipes.<br /><br />Now this in itself is a bit too unorthodox for people who are used to consuming a book cover to cover, I for one really appreciated it as I did not have to endure anything that did not interest me (although the book is filled with interesting \\"recipes\\" from from Osso Bucco to learning Kanji).<br /><br />So why the 4-stars you may ask?  Well, I actually wanted more from certain portions of the book.  The WILD section for example really piqued my interest in hunting (I own a bow and mainly use it for target practice meditation, but I don't hunt).  While my kitchen-mad scientist bone was tickled in the SCIENCE pages.  The PRO section just made me drool so much that I had to try making a dish from its chapter.  While things may seem \\"too out there\\" or intimidating at first, just keep sharpening your techniques and practice the easier, but still ridiculously, delicious recipes in the DOMESTIC portion of the book until you can garner enough courage to try something uncomfortable/fun.<br /><br />Hope this review helps.<br /><br />This is a great book, and at over 650 pages is also a monster of a book.<br /><br />Cheers.
0547884591|5.0|I don't know that I can add that much in terms of detail-  there are plenty of reviews, and he's a master of publicity, so there are loads of tasters (sic) available.  Suffice it to say that this book contains loads of practical advice to help you learn to do anything- and I'm grateful enough to Mr Ferris to bother coming here to write this review, just as a way of showing appreciation.  Thanks Tim!<br /><br />(BUY THE BOOK!)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great movie and I highly recomend it to all ages.  Jennifer Lawarence is terrific in this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game provides great eye-hand coordination in a game that is not violent so it is appropriate for younger players.  I like the many variations of the game and the challenge to reach higher and higher/
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its good but sometimes it is really annoying! but still it id a fun game awesome and it intirtains everyone!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I am not good at chess!  This game starts at a level that I can beat and that is good.  I move to higher levels as I learn the game.  There are other games to select and being able to select levels from novice to good is excellent.  The screen is clear and easy to follow.
0739432176|5.0|In a nutshell (the story at least): 18-year-old Sabriel is forced to rise up to save the day when her father (a clever necromancer) goes missing. She'll have to test those skills that were learned from he himself, deal with powerful enemies, ride along with a hazy character, who may or may not be on her side, and meet the man of her dreams in the process. The loving are the daring after all, aren't they? It is another coming of age story, might be said. Well, this one is far superior than most.<br /><br />Daughter of a wise Necromancer, Sabriel one day receives her father's tools, bells and a sword, and must go to his aid. She goes into the Ancient Kingdom, a land of magic, dead, good, and evil. She is joined by a cat, and meets a prince who'd been cursed (kiss a frog? Or in this case, a figurehead). Together, they fight their way onward and through many hardships, and that unexpected ultimate loss, they vanquish evil, and restore peace in the Ancient Kingdom.<br /><br />Another little girl in another famous story (Alice in Wonderland) found herself in a strange land, dealing with strange situations and creatures. Here, although Sabriel does not have all the advantages of the age she lived in (on her side of the wall), and although she finds thrown into a stranger, darker and much more dangerous place, she is never a victim or an ingénue damsel in distress: she knows that she relies on those fatherly teachings and knows that this is her quest and her ordeal, facing any doubt whether she is really prepared to be and do what is expected of her, she uses her own resolve and wit, a little magic, and that enigma of a cat.<br /><br />The story shows (maybe a better verb is Sings) how life is not black and white, how people can't always choose sides, how no matter what's going on around you, you must look into yourself and find your own strength. It deals with loss, grief, moving on, with adolescence and with how finding that first love means more the discovery of ourselves in others, and sharing with us the delight of that recognition.<br /><br />Usually, male characters are painted as an extension of what women think the perfect man should be, but, hey, being realistic, who would really want to spend her life with a vampire who can't help but crooning the world, and whispering to you, how much he loves you? Wouldn't you rather journey with a man of honor, of courage, who shows his love rather than talk about it? Instead of being changed or improved by him and the relationship, who wouldn't rather be that strong young woman who finds her might, who can fight against adversity without super powers? Talk about a role model girls should vie for.<br /><br />I do believe that from all those stories that form the tapestry of our experiences, the fantasy ones (such as this one) exemplify realistically human nature, how every decision has consequences, the importance of honor, honor as in ancient times, honor gained through your actions, your words, honor among your peers. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in life because it reflects everything we are or want to be. In Sabriel, the world is defenseless against all they have forgotten, except for the people close to the wall, who still remember, no one stands a chance. And even they are in grave danger.<br /><br />They say that the test of a book is dreading to begin the last chapter, and I found myself clutching those very last pages wishing that this one had no end, that that dreaded last chapter lingered. So much that I named my own cat Mogget to honor that paradigm of smartness and bravery.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock works perfectly on the Kindle Fire! I think the thing I like most about it is that it will go off even if your device is off. Like many other alarm clocks won't But it has so many other great features. Sice there are math problems I have to solve before I hit snooze. I actually wake up. I really like it I thinks it's really good and this is a must have for Kindle Fire users. :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it. I watch all of the sessions in like a month. Best show ever.  recommend it for sure. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a very addictictive book..... I can't wait to start the next one. It should be very interesting......  Thanks
014241493X|4.0|Book was delivered along with a DVD. It was below the DVD, mostly good condition, brand new but was dented on the top so all the pages dented as well. I wouldnt complain if it was a book for me as I would just be reading it but its a gift.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a well written entertaining read. What a story!  Pi is truly an admirable character, he went through so much. Must read
0061474355|5.0|I have been a fan of this book for a very long time. It is beautifully written and every time I go back to it I find something new or spot something else. The use of two world in one is fascinating and well done, and in my head I read it as Scotland and England due to the Wall, though I don't know if this was the intention.<br /><br />I also love that when I read it, it was one of very few books with a strong female lead character that was available to me. I have recommended it to my friends over and over and read it more times than I can count. The sequels are equally as good. Read them!!
B009CPE424|4.0|Cute story, the customers are adorable.:-) The scuba gear particularly. The dresses were beautiful, but my boy hates<br />costumes, how do they get all the dogs to dress up?
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app a lot.  I get the most accurate forecast and I don't have to figure out what to do to see all of the panels.  I haven't had any problems with the app either.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! If you are a fan of campy, foreign (especially Aussie and British) films, you MUST get this movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Nice photos.  Entertaining for down time, Dr's visits. I do not see a way to import one's own photos. That would be nice.
0060899220|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Tony, so I am long overdue in reading this. It's exactly what I expected, with his crass, honest and humerous depiction of kitchen life. Having spent over 2 decades in the restaurant biz, I felt this book was right on. This is a memoir, so don't expect a cook book.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The seasons are harder and harder, which is good. Some of the scenes repeat themselves or are very close in comparison
B00008G7UF|5.0|I love seeing Meg Ryan in her prime. This is a sweet, charming, romantic comedy. Not an academy award performance, but still one of my favorites.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|This CD, since it was first released, continues to be my most favorite holiday music.  And I love the addition of the new tune.  Beautiful.
B005LF9OCE|4.0|Love the show its very funny great story. The really only character I don't like is Ted (the main character). The truth is though the show has passed its prime and needs to be rapped up.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Word of warning readers--you're not reading anything new in this novel, which isn't to say that what you will read is horrible in its predictability. Do we all know the gist of the story from the description given? Yeah, pretty much. Is it still worth a read? For sure, because that isn't all there is to it.<br /><br />The novel is well-written, something that free kindle reads don't offer as much as they should. The characters are consistent, we learn what shapes them and why they do what they do; there are no lapses in character authenticity. I wish there was more development of secondary characters and their ties to Connor and Megan, but you can't have everything.<br /><br />Summarily, A good-enough read...it won't blow your mind away or anything, but there is some charm to it. I would have gone for a 3 1/2 stars if it were available.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|It was a great movie.<br />Typical Heart warming Disney story with Great animation from Pixar.<br /><br />Story was a little corny but that is to be expected.<br /><br />I loved the accents!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read a few pages of reviews that were great and it had a lot of stars. So i decided to read it. I didnt see all the bad reviews tilll just now. I coulve liked this book it had potential. I got to the ending and am shocked that anyone would leave a book like this. A complete waste of my time and money!!!! I dont see how this is on best seller list.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|What more needs to be said? The Alien movies on Bluray!!!!!! You can skip Aliens 4 it sucks but the other three are awesome movies.
B008AT71WI|5.0|If you love this movie you will enjoy the extra booklet it comes with that gives some of the history of the stage play turned Hollywood movie.  When you watch this movie on blu-ray it just gives so much more than watching it in the past low quality vhs.
0525953728|4.0|I bought this book for it's modern military missions. I wanted to read something from the times we are all living through even though we're lucky not be the actual guys sacrificing to go over. Good book, good read and great to know guys like these are on our side!!
B009KHCRVO|5.0|What is there to say except, it was incredible, awesome, pulp B-movie making at its best. At first I thought it would be a movie to watch, not enjoy, as I was cleaning the house. It took all of three minutes for me to drop what I was doing, rewind it and fall back into the pure simple fun of it all.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have to say, I've been a long-time Grobanite and love love love all of his previous work. I knew Illuminations was going to be a different direction for him so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Unlike every single one of his previous albums, I didn't immediately love this one. Yes, it's quite different. But if you're truly a fan, go into this one with open ears and an open mind.<br /><br />The more I listen to this album, the more I love it. My favorite song on this album changes all the time. I immediately loved \\"voce existe em mim\\" and felt it had a lot of the same \\"bigness\\" as many of the number 1 tracks on previous albums, yet had a totally different kind of sound. \\"Bells of New York\\" came in close second and took over the number one spot on my list for awhile (as I said, it keeps changing!) I'm currently enamored with \\"Wandering Kind\\" even though he doesn't actually sing that song. To think he wrote that at twelve years old is astounding!<br /><br />My point is, especially for you die hard Grobanites out there, give this album time to digest. Really listen and listen again. If you still don't like it after that, that's fair. Just please don't dismiss this one because it's \\"different.\\"
B003FB0268|5.0|This was a gift, so I can't comment on the book itselt. It arrived on time, and he was happy with it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love every track! She is such a talented songwriter, and the lyrics and music combine to mean so much.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I can't complain about anything that is free. It is easy to use and fun, so I'm happy with it.
1400049628|5.0|This book was very informitive and clever, it brought up some thing i had not thought of.<br />Highly recemend it to any zombie fan.
1892005034|5.0|I am taking part in a class on nonviolent communication, and this book is optional. I am so glad I bought it. And the book is like new!
B009K0P10K|5.0|You know normally I don't care for snobby shows about being rich and famous or soap opera type dramas... but this one appeals to the underdog.  LOL  It's wickedly appealing and has lots of twists and turns that keep you engaged and anxious for the next episode. Oh and they got some poor people in it too.  LOL
B0097EWK3A|4.0|great game, amazing graphics, puzzles and hidden objects perfectly fit in to make it seem like it could be real... I finished it in three hours :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it it tells me how much battery I have :) I carry my kindle every where I go I love it I just like seeing the percent
B005ES5YEU|5.0|Crocs are a most for our kids. Perfect for the pool, beach, and around the house. I also love them because they last over a year even as their feet grow so fast. :)
1616284382|5.0|images that I haven't seen before- great resource - I haven't seen the film in years but made me want to see it again
B0090X4HES|5.0|This album is really well put together; it is very cohesive and it has a nice variety of tracks.  The skits littered throughout, literally makes the album and transitions the track nicely.  The production is nice and smooth, featuring some of the stronger names in the industry, with a laid back feel with a real consistent atmosphere.  The whole album feels like it belongs with each other with nothing feeling out of place.  Kendrick Lamars performs well with his quick tongue and laid back flow, which complements the production well.  His direction on the tracks with impeccable and greatly captivating, grabbing your attention and not letting go.  There is really nothing negative about this album.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|It was just OK.... I felt like the ending was extremely rushed and the author was in a panic to end this book. I had a lot of questions. SPOILERS!<br />What was the point in Marshal killing Sally?<br />What was the point in Marshal marrying Lavinia in the first place?<br />Why were Belle's chapters so short compared to Lavinia's?<br />I know the author thought she was going to have a twist ending when you remember the beginning.<br />It was an OK read but not one of my favorites by any means.

B0086700CM|5.0|Super fun and a little addictive. Hearkens back to Indiana Jones.  The monkey's faces are scary. Try it-you will love it.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Nice and cheap product. It's sturdy and well made. It doesn't get five stars from me because its not deep enough for my taste to hold cups or drinks
B009YP9L7U|5.0|If this is a preview of more to come with this new Harlequin line, I will definitely be buying more. The writer took an old tale and reworked it so well. There was so much feeling involved in this story. I wanted to pop the hero upside the head, but to me that's a sign of a good book. :)
B004XWLN20|2.0|Well, I'm on my 2nd one and about to return it for a refund because WB did not give this a good design there were huge flaws with both, the 1st one was missing a disc and every disc was scratched the 2nd one a lot of discs were scratched and it did affect playback. WB needs to get their heads out of their butts and release a Blu Ray version  of this set because they're durable (when was the last time you seen a Blu Ray scratched and GREAT quality my next one will be bought in a store, so the return will be more convenient if i experience the same results as the previous 2 smh. I just wanna sit back and enjoy the show LOL.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was such a good game I cant stop playing it is beast mo everyone should play it you shoulld try it
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was recently told about this and I love the app. however I can not figure out where the directions are for the things I want to try. so if n e can help me please let me know. I use it on my kindle fire only so if you know how to get to the direction please e mail me at.  patchkb@yahoo.com and tell me what to do. if I can figure that out then it will get 5 stars.
B005SZAEYO|4.0|I just finished this series, and i really enjoyed it. Its a great twist on the often retold haunted house story with a good story about family and responsibility mixed in. This series will sometimes leave you feeling a little lost but it picks up all the loose ends very well. Even my wife, whom hates horror shows, really liked the story. If you liked the TV show, \\"American Gothic\\", then you will appreciate this show. This show is one of a few on a very short list of shows that i can not come up with any real negative things about.<br /><br />This is a show that you must really pay attention too, because missing a smaller detail will through you off the story when bigger details are revealed. I give it four stars only because i felt the husband/wife lead characters i feel were an odd casting, i just had a hard time getting there chemistry to work for me, but it did eventually work for me.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I find it is pretty rare to put on any cd and listen to the entire playlist. However this album is absolutely fantastic. Every Song is unique. I would recommend buying the entire album. I hope ya'll come to the New Orleans Area Soon.<br /><br />I rate the following tracks in order from the best to ....(I can't say worst)<br />  Cruise<br />  Get Your Shine On<br />  Here's to the Good Times<br />  Hell Raisin' Heat Of The Summer<br />  Round Here<br />  Tell Me How You Like It<br />  Dayum Baby<br />  Tip It Back<br />  Stay<br />  Party People<br />  It's Just What We Do
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not my typical book when it comes to content yet I couldn't put it down! Author did a great job.
0547884591|5.0|How incredibly refreshing to read a cookbook that doesn't start off by saying to purchase the most expensive equipment you can afford!  This book tries to do what TF has done with fitness in 4HB:  get you the biggest bang for your buck.  The book delivers.
0060873175|1.0|This is not a Crichton book.  Hell, this isn't even a Preston book.  This is more like a fic of a Crichton book written by an avid high-school fan who thinks \\"copypaste from Wikipedia\\" is a good substitute for both actual science and literary technique.  The characters are stereotypically bad to the point where I was glad when Singh bought it after a poorly-timed spiritual awakening, just so the offensive pseudohindu simpering would end.<br /><br />Possibly the only reason to read this book is for the several pages devoted to the standard-issue Hawaiian detective eating Spam as brain food, and his eventual Spamfuelled revelation that he should do nothing for a while, then open an investigation if none of the missing people have come back yet.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Fantastic movie at a great price. It was promptly shipped and recieved in great shape. I recommend it to anyone.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|I have a consumer video services company.  I need a way to scan slides faster than we currently<br />do with a flatbed scanner.  I bought the unit to speed-up production.<br />I was anxious to try the unit, so I rescanned some slides that we just finished<br />for a customer.  So I had a \\"Before\\" and \\"After\\" picture to compare.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for the novice/consumer that is looking to do the leg work themselves.<br />There is no way to control color with this unit.<br />A lot of slides were yellow or blue.  I was able to color correct the scans with my photo editor.<br /><br />It was extremely fast and the picture was OK.<br />I hooked up the USB cable and a Digital Media Card for saving.<br />Easy to transfer and access the files from the media card.<br /><br />Give it a try.  If you are looking for top quality slide scans, this unit is not for you.<br />I may keep it to use for 35mm negatives to scan.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Great movie, great price, and excellent service. If the game was this exciting I would still be playing it instead of watching it.
0007137303|5.0|As a teenager with Dyslexia reading was not something I enjoyed, instead it was more of something the school made me do and I would try to avoid it as much as possible. Then in 2002 I was given Sabriel as a Christmas gift. It sat on my shelf for a few months before I finally got around to reading it and for the first time I had a book I actually wanted to read. It is one of the few books that I will pick up just for the fun of reading it, and have read it many times since I first recieved it. It is a really great story that sucks you in and stays a good read in years to come.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Good movie, pay attention or you'll miss the good stuff.  I love Robert Down Jr and I like the Sherlock Holmes series.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Considering that, say, the LOTR trilogy box set was close to $100 when it came out.  This batman trilogy is a steal at $30. I was already going to purchase TDKR on blu-ray but it only cost a few more dollars to get the other two as well (which I only have on DVD at the moment).  Well worth it.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie, all the actors do an excellent job, it's cool to have a good movie about moonshining.
0307341550|3.0|Was not sure what to rate this novel! I love when i see a book with a new take on things but this book Portrayed a very dark side of human nature and can't say that I liked it. It was kind of a depressing read for me. Even the main character has some serious issues.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|If you can get past Kristen Stewart's horrible acting you will love this movie, Charlize Theron makes up for Kristen's acting.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed it. It keeps you wanting more, reading more... The only bad thing is that I didn't sleep for about 5 day (that's how much it took me to finish the three books!!!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A charming tale with an all-star cast perfect for their roles. Friendship oversomes adversity and lush colors of India's culture as well.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Its a clock, Its an Alarm, Its an Alarm Clock... I have used it on my kindle on several occasions, It has not let me down so far...
B00936A0RU|4.0|\\"In 1920 they passed the prohibition law making the sale of alcohol illegal, well at least it was supposed to be.\\" This is based on the true story of the Bondurant Brothers and their moonshine running in Virginia in the '20's. The three brothers ran liquor and owned the county until a man from the Chicago outfit showed up to try and take over. The brother's don't give in as easy as everyone else. I was looking forward to this movie because I love gangster type movies and the idea of it seemed entertaining to me. I did like the movie a lot but the movie is a little slow in a few places but it in no way drags (if that makes sense). The movie opens up gritty and stays that way all the way to the end, which I really liked. The style of the filming and the look of it really fit the movie and added a lot to the enjoyment of it for me. Gary Oldman, while not in this as much as I was hoping, was great and really had a huge impact on the movie. I really enjoyed this but this is not a movie for everyone but if you are into these old time, gritty gangster movies then you will love this. Overall, a very entertaining and enjoyable movie for fans of this genre. I give it a B+.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|loud enough not too load. great that it works on its own.  Would recommend  for those that need to get up on time
B0099114WO|4.0|\\"There's no magic pill or wand, he's just a guy with an office.\\" Kay (Streep) and Arnold (Jones) have been married for a long time. Kay thinks they have a problem in their marriage, Arnold does not. Kay wants to go see a counselor, Arnold does not. Kay thinks talking will help, Arnold does not. Kay pays for the trip, Arnold does not. They both end up in counseling together. Kay likes it, Arnold does not. This is actually a pretty funny movie along the lines of \\"Something's Gotta Give\\". Streep and Jones are great in this and really believable as an old married couple. The one thing that really surprised me about this movie is how dirty it was. Not over the top dirty, but I saw Streep do things in this I never thought I would (nor ever really wanted to) so be prepared for that. I will say that this is funny and worth watching but if you are renting it for your grandma I would preview it first...just in case. Overall, funny and worth watching, but you must know your guests sense of humor if you are watching with someone. I give it a B+.
B008I43DYU|5.0|As I've gotten more mature, my ability to add & subtract in my head has gone by the wayside.  Yes, I have a calculator on my phone, but it's so small I need glasses to see use it.  I really like the size of this calculator as I can see it without my glasses & the keys are large enough I don't hit the wrong number or function.  PLUS the price was right!!!
B000085RPU|1.0|I was very disappointed when my DVD arrived and I was unable to view it because I live in the wrong region.  Much to my surprise DVD's are specific to certain regions and our DVD players will not allow them to play.  I purchased it from Amazon and it said it was coming from North Carolina so why would I suspect that I would not be able to watch it.  In fact, until this incident I was totally unaware of such a thing and I feel that consumers should be informed about this.  So you are warned!  I will however mention that the company Amazon arranged my purchase through refunded my money but my time was wasted.
B009A87X80|5.0|I'm a HUGE Eva Cassidy fan!!!  I have practically every one of her CDs.  This one, as the name indicates, is simply a compilation of some of her best songs.

1419707663|5.0|These books were bought as a Christmas present for a child who has had the opportunity to read 4-6 & loved them.  I thought he might enjoy reading the first 3  books & this item is PERFECT to accomplish this at a greatly reduced price over individual purchases.  I was impressed with the quality of the books & the box will keep them held in a compact fashion on his book shelf.  I can't wait until he open his gift at Christmas to see his reaction!!!
1593272782|3.0|It's a great book to learn mechanisms. However, it uses older older lego parts that are no longer available. A child using this book now would have a tough time trying to make some of these things. It could be better using current lego parts.

B009MB682W|5.0|As a teenager, I saw the first 007 film, DR. NO, in a theater in 1962. Now, fifty years later, I've seen every film except the newest one (SKYFALL), and I'll see it next weekend. I've enjoyed every film, especially the earlier ones that were based on Ian Fleming's novels. Over time, some of the less memorable films in the series have faded from my memory. What has remained, however, is the great theme music. Quite a few of the 007 songs are great songs in their own right, and some of them are on several of my playlists.<br /><br />A brief summary of my thoughts about some of my favorite songs in this digital album:<br /><br />* The \\"James Bond Theme\\" - One of the most recognizable songs in the history of movies, it's hard to get out of your head.<br /><br />* \\"Goldfinger\\" - Arguably the most famous song in the 007 series, Shirley Bassey is downright awesome.<br /><br />* \\"You Only Live Twice\\" - A haunting tune by Nancy Sinatra, \\"You Only Live Twice\\" is one of composer John Barry's finest pieces. The big orchestral sound, with the strings and French horns, is unforgettable.<br /><br />* \\"All Time High\\" - From OCTOPUSSY, this was one of Rita Coolidge's biggest hits. Not generally considered one of the best 007 songs, it's still one of my own favorites. Interestingly, it's one of the only song titles that didn't match the title of the film.<br /><br />* \\"A View to a Kill\\" - This great song probably got a lot more play than the movie. It's pure electricity and definitely one of my top five 007 songs.<br /><br />Those were my favorites, but by no means are they the only songs I like in the collection. There are maybe 3-4 songs that are just plain weak, but the others are all very playable and are a marvelous trip down memory lane for 007 fans.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|There's plenty of &#34;new dad&#34; scenes and hot chicks to keep the movie interesting for men, but it is something you would only watch with the wife because she chose to watch it.
B0081BU42O|5.0|I look forward to any Culture novel from Iain Banks, and this one is an example of why. A joy to read.
B009329ZF2|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE. Best of the 2012 year!!!<br />If you like Independence Day you will love this movie!!! The only thing I hated about the movie was that they always let the humans win the battles, when they have shown the aliens have far superior shields and weaponry.<br />Even with the one sided &#34;humans will win every battle&#34; the movie is worth owning!!! You have never seen a movie like this and it is all about the US NAVY and being an American!<br />Not all humans win the battles, they have awesome destruction scenes that help make the movie more realistic and that nobody else has dared shown in a movie that was not an actual war documentation.<br />This movie is bold and goes where no movie has gone before - I rank it as one of the Star Trek movies - it is that worthy!
0801896940|5.0|Neuenschwander's superb explanation of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics will lead you to the best introduction to Noether's theorem I have read.<br />This well written book is graspable by anyone with multivariate calculus knowledge.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|I thought this was the movie being shown and talked about on the radio and TV, that is just now out on DVD. Seems to have the same title. I don't get it. THIS IS A CARTOON - ANIMATED MOVIE - I do not know where the real movie is??? Can't find it on Amazon... Just a couple of days ago they showed the actor on ET and a scene from the movie where he said something like &#34;Gotham needs me again&#34;... They also said the DVD contained a bonus on the different Bat Mobiles. I tried to watch the 1st 10 minutes and could not, too much like a comic book.<br />I guess I have to spend some time in Google to find the actual movie...

1451620829|4.0|Okay, I am a pretty huge Kiss fan. They were the first band I got into as a young kid of 11 years-old. I discovered the band in 1977 right around the time Kiss Alive II was released, and I heard it at a friend's house. I promptly went out and purchased their latest studio album Love Gun, and became an instant fan. Prior to that, it was music like the Grease soundtrack, and the Bee Gees, and other poppy disco stuff of the time. So, Kiss was my first taste of hard rock, and I consumed all they had.<br /><br />They were my first concert experience, seeing the Dynasty tour in 1979 and many times after that. The only thing I really knew about the band was what I saw. Not an avid reader, nor a real follower of the latest tabloid/magazine world, I did not spend much time following the behind the scenes publicized dirt. They were super heroes to me - amazing musicians who put on a great show.<br /><br />Now, 35 years later, I am still a big fan. I have all of their albums, I have a bunch of merchandise too. I follow them religiously to a degree. Obviously I like hundreds of other bands now, but still Kiss ranks up their as a key player in my eye. I have followed the solo stuff, I have followed the former members (Ace & Peter), but still, only paid a small amount of attention to the publicized dirt.<br /><br />I bought Gene's book, [[ASIN:0609810022 Kiss and Make-Up]], but never read it. I did read his other book, [[ASIN:1597775029 Sex Money Kiss]], which I laughed off as just a bunch of his egotistical self-centered money-hungry crap that it was. I read Ace's biography [[ASIN:1451613954 No Regrets]] a few months back, and it really focused a lot more on his own personal struggle. The early formative years of Kiss were brought to life as seen through his eyes, but overall, the book seemed more centered around his own personal dark struggles, with not quite as much bad-mouthing as we find in this book by Peter.<br /><br />After finishing Peter's book, I have to say, my opinion on the band is drastically twisted. I am torn between two opinions. First, on one side, Peter was self-destructing and a real arrogant jerk who seemed to care less about others or even himself. With the amount of drugs and trash that he got into, just like I felt with Ace's book, it is surprising these two are still alive. Peter made so many bad decisions, he acted so ignorantly, impulsively, and abusively that it makes me despise him for the most part, and I often feel like he got what he deserved. Before, during and after Kiss, he just always seemed like a jerk.<br /><br />On the other hand though, after hearing the horrible stuff that Gene and Paul put him through, I can almost feel sorry for him, and that stuff makes me lose all respect for and despise them. But still, I see two sides fighting head-to-head, with Peter being a jerk, and Paul/Gene also being major jerks continually. It is hard to tell if this was cause and effect or not. As a musician myself, I can relate to some of the behind the scenes aspects of it. If I were like Gene, a sober, serious musicians looking at the business aspect of all that gets done (which I do tend to be), would I react the same way if a member of my band was a drugged out jerk-wad always getting in trouble and soiling the band's name and image? Probably so.<br /><br />Were Gene and Paul reacting to the horrible lifestyles of Peter and Ace, and that pressure caused more tension backlash from Peter and Ace? That seems to be the story we hear from one side. But Peter's story at times makes you feel Gene and Paul were abusive from the start, regardless of the drugs, etc. My real question is, with the amount of drugs and alcohol that Peter and Ace claim to have been constantly consuming all those years, how could they really remember very much about all of these details as they claim to in their books? Maybe their perspective is greatly clouded by their activity, and so they think things were worse than they were. It is tough toreally say, since it becomes just his word against his word against his word. Now Paul is working on his biography, so we can soon add a fourth version. Paul and Gene were sober, so could their telling be more accurate? Or are they just twisting it to make their selves look good. Were they taking advantage of the always drugged up guys all along?<br /><br />Peter seemed fairly clean and sober during the reunion tour, so for sure it seems they really screwed him and Ace during that time period, making Gene and Paul out as simply appalling people, which seems to be not just coming from Peter's words only. The trail of disgruntled former Kiss members can attest to there being some kind of real issue with the Gene/Paul team. I will chime in on the current replacement members wearing the Cat and Spaceman makeup - it is despicable and reprehensible. I have seen the band live twice with the new guys (I know, somewhat hypocritical to do that), and the band as a unit is amazing, and the new music they make is great. But there would have been no sense of fun lost at ALL if Tommy and Eric had their own characters, just like Eric Carr and Vinnie had. I believe it would have been a much more professional and honorable thing for them to have done, rather than allowing new people to wear the characters of the original members. After reading this book, I see this action as purposely being a personal attack against Peter and Ace - again, showing Gene and Paul to be truly horrible people.<br /><br />I have followed all of the seasons of Gene's Family Jewels show, and have gotten to somewhat know the man more than I have from just years of listening to his music. I found him to be quite human and loveable, and at times felt sorry for him on the show. Occasionally you get a peak at the hard-edged business man on the show, but these books show more of that side than the show ever does. The show gives us some of the silliness and family side of things, but at times I feel it might be scripted and set to be more entertainment than true reality. Peter's book takes away all of that love-ability that I built up from his show, and flushes it down the toilet. Gene comes out as a truly scumbag, bottom-feeding, womanizing, self-gratifying despicable character.<br /><br />In the end, Peter is/was a self-destructive, horrible person who made a lot of bad mistakes, abused himself and others frequently, and did a lot of wrong to a lot of people for a lot of years. It sounds like now he is on the road to settling down from that lifestyle, and the last section of the book discussing his relationship with God is a promising step forward, but the damage done in his wake is a long way from being rectified, and he still comes out looking like a bad guy through this all. So, he has opened the door to really reveal the filth that was his own life, and in the process whines incessantly about how he was treated.<br /><br />The fantasy is gone - the band Kiss will now forever be tainted in my mind. No longer are they just this cool, mysterious band of larger-than-life excitement on stage, but they are now a bunch of low-life self-pleasing jerks who only look out for their own best interests regardless of who they have to plow over to get what they want. Maybe this is nothing new for a rock band, but it really destroys the view of my first-loved rock band. Will I still listen to them? Yes, absolutely - the fantasy lives on in the music, tainted as my mind may be now.<br /><br />Oh, and one last comment. After reading this book, Peter last album, 2007's [[ASIN:B000RIHBI4 One for All]], which I admit I frowned on from the start and did not consider it to be much at all, takes on an entirely new life to me, and now I truly enjoy it much more, understanding the background that led to it.

0307352145|5.0|Do you hear it?  One third of the population is standing, applauding this monumental work by Susan Cain.  You probably can't hear it.  The applause is subdued, but heart-felt.  Most of the applauders are standing alone in their living room, a fire crackling in the fireplace, and the television is off.  They like it that way - the alone part, the fireplace part, and non-television part.  They are the introverts of the world, and they just finished reading the first book dedicated to explaining their sensitive, reflective selves.  The book is entitled, Quiet: The Power of Introverts In a World That Can't Stop Talking.<br /><br />At 268 pages of text, 271 End Notes, and a full index, the book covers a lot of material, and much of it in depth.  The book is no dry textbook, though.  Susan Cain shares much of her own story, including her discovery of her strengths and weaknesses as an introverted attorney. She shares her journey to understand those similar to her, the introverts in the world.  Throughout much of the book she shares her firsthand accounts of meeting the researchers who have spent their careers understanding introversion and extroversion.<br /><br />I was hooked in the introduction.  A quick self-assesment concluded that I, indeed, fit the bill for introversion.  I couldn't agree more with statements like,\\"I dislike small talk, but I enjoy talking in depth about topics that matter to me, \\" and \\"I prefer not to show or discuss my work with others until it's finished.\\"<br /><br />In the first part of the book, Cain attempts to illustrate what she calls the \\"American Extrovert Ideal,\\" by highlighting the work of Dale Carnegie (\\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\"), business models that force employees to work in teams, and business schools that coerce the \\"quiet kids\\" into constant collaboration.  Cain even visited an evangelical mega-church and concluded that much of American Christianity doesn't work for introverts.  She almost lost me in this first section.  The tone was humorous, but still a bit reactionary.  I realize that she was building her case, but in doing so, her conclusions were much too broad.  For instance, in the area where I have the most experience, the Church, I think she got it wrong!  In fact, in reflection on her mega-church visit, she quotes her host - a fellow introvert and pastor (who does not attend the church they visited) who says, \\"There was no emphasis on quiet, liturgy, ritual, things that give you space for contemplation.\\"  Hence, their discomfort in a public worship service.  Were they to dig deeper, they would find that this church teaches those contemplative practices to their members as they grow in their faith.  And while I am a raging introvert, I have to say that I do not prefer to worship publicly in a quiet setting featuring formal liturgy.  To suggest that introverts prefer a certain style of worship is to push general conclusions too far.  And if this was the case in an area where I have a bit of knowledge, I wonder where else this was the case.  However, she makes a strong case for the struggle of most introverts to find their place in American culture.<br /><br />In part two, Cain shares some of the relevant research on introversion.  I especially connected with the research of Jerome Kagan.  Kagan discovered that introverts tend to be very sensitive to external stimuli- almost over-stimulated - in that we observe everything around us, and then, having reached stimuli-capacity quicker than the extroverts around us, we need to retreat to a non-stimulating place in order to reflect, rest, and re-charge our ability to be stimulated.  Kagan noted especially that introverts are very alert, very sensitive, and experience complex emotions. That is so me!<br /><br />Cain's book is not just stories and theory.  In part four, she suggests strategies and practices that introverts can adopt to thrive and succeed in a world that is often uncomfortable for them.  She shares the secretto public speaking (and no, it has nothing to do with imagining the audience's clothing, or lack thereof).  She shares networking strategies for introverts who really want to \\"work a room.\\"  Finally, she shares strategies for parenting an introvert.  (I think I have one - I better re-read this chapter)  I would suggest that the reader only read the chapters in this section that directly interest them.  Honestly, the book feels a little too long at this point.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this to any introvert who wants to better understand themselves and learn to succeed in a world filled with extroverted success.  I would also recommend it to the spouse of an introvert.  This work will remain a standard for years!<br /><br />Required FTC Disclaimer: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.  That means they gave me a free copy of the book in exchange for my honest opinion about it.
0547884591|5.0|It was so nice to discover \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\" since I just finished reading \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" and am absolutely committed to live by \\"The 4-Hour Workweek\\" - all by Timothy Ferriss.  Non-cooks (or non-whatevers) now have hope to improve the quality of their lives, despite personal weaknesses.  What I really appreciate about Timothy is that he details step-by-step how to do everything he is advocating, rather than giving the reader some pie-in-the-sky untested concept that might sound good but doesn't work in real life.  I really admire Tim's commitment to due diligence and his humor in communicating what he has learned through experience.  So, whoever you are, go for it!  Have fun and enjoy Tim's passion.

B004W4CK44|5.0|You needn't see the film to enjoy the soundtrack, but if you loved the film you'll find your feet tapping and your mind filled with beautiful images. I have given this soundtrack as a gift, and have had to replace it because the copies keep finding new homes.
034580404X|3.0|Ordered trilogy set. Order was delivered quickly. Fifty Shades of Grey was good, but I thought the other 2 were predictable. Good reads on cold, rainy/snowy days though.
0547884591|5.0|He did it again!! LOVE IT!! A MUST BUY ASAP!!!! I honestly didn't know what to expect but I am pleasantly pleased.. I am a 4 Hour girl for life.. That paired with nutritional cleansing has CHANGED MY LIFE!!!<br />Thanks TIM FERRISS!!
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Recently purchased the U.S. version of The Beatles 2012 Stereo Vinyl Remaster Box Set.  The sound is excellent IMHO.  Great mastering/cutting job by Sean Magee @ Abbey Road Studios. Some of the titles such as Beatles For Sale, and Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band have never sounded better.<br /><br />The manufacturing, well that's another story.  Apple/EMI contracted out the U.S. LPs to Rainbo, to manufacture the box set. This pressing plant's QC was poor. By now you've probably read other reviews where the box set is having to be replaced or at least some of the titles due to sub-par pressings.<br /><br />Of the 14 titles, 16 LPs, I had 5 defective titles, 7 LPs that were returned to the store.  Unfortunately the Canadian retailer I purchased the set from, would not order another box and allow me to compile one good box and return the other to them.<br /><br />The defective tiles include:<br /><br />Rubber Soul - non-fill issues and noisy vinyl<br />The Beatles aka The White Album - non-fill issues<br />Yellow Submarine - lots of clicks and pops<br />Abbey Road - warped, lots of clicks and pops<br />Past Masters - non-fill issues<br /><br />Sat down the other day for a critical listening session with the replacement LP copy of Abbey Road.  It was noisy starting on Side 1 Track 2, \\"Something\\".  Just imagine listening to a Beatles album, while your sitting next to a crackling fireplace.  Get the picture?  The next day I took Abbey Road to one of the local audiophile equipment dealers. We cleaned the LP on a VPI machine. Then we played Abbey Road on an Oracle Scout turntable that retails in the $3500-$4000 range with an $800 cartridge. LP was still noisy.<br /><br />I've also finished listening to The White Album and Yellow Submarine. Both noisy again. They will be returned now along with Abbey Road, for a 2nd time.<br /><br />Wish I'd purchased the E.U. box set from Amazon.co.uk.  When the mono LP box set is released in 2013, I'm buying the Euro version, even ifit is $100 more the price in North America.<br /><br />I rate the sound an 8 out of 10.<br />I rate the LP pressings a 4 out of 10.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|our family watched this together. great movie, great moral. stayed true to the book (plus some). Enjoyed it from the beginning to end. is it ironic that this movie gets you thinking about all the stuff we dont need, yet we purchased it on Amazon to watch? no, probably not.
B008RJFRTK|1.0|What use is a map if you cant even mark the route you want to take. Directions with a highlighted route would be optimal but cant even mark ur route? !?!?! Annoying
B0086DBE62|3.0|it was ok. i knew it was going to be light hearted and kinda corny. it was. julia roberts did great. overall the movie was only really worth a few bucks to see maybe, might even be a dollar rental movie
B00009W8N2|5.0|This is an oldie by Opeth, but if you're an Opeth fan - who cares. It is still a great piece of work.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|yes, finally a series worth my time. i love this book and could not wait to dive into the second one and beyond.
B006ZT47O0|5.0|Another great one! Can't determine which CD I like best - they're all great, but this one is just as awesome. Check it out!
B003H4RDZQ|4.0|This book is not for everyone but was perfect for the people in this house.  Clearly the author brought some real-life memories and experiences to these unexpected stories and characters that live outside the pristine snow globe.  Only David Sedaris could pull off &#34;Dinah the Christmas Whore&#34; and manage to entertain his  following.  I can't wait to read my next David Sedaris book -  &#34;Naked&#34;.  These are short stories, perfect to read at the airport or on a plane...
B004LROUNG|4.0|The book was referred by a friend. I have read several books by the author and enjoyed them all. This one did not disappoint.
B00285K1KE|1.0|I decided to give this movie another try after not having seen it since it's theatrical release.  I often will re-watch a film years later after not liking it originally, only to find myself thoroughly enjoying it the second time through.<br /><br />This was unfortunately not one of those times.  I won't quite go as far as calling it un-watchable.  But dear God it was close to it.  The acting is ok.  But between the pacing which erratic and the plot which was so bad I actually wanted to go watch Gigli as a palate cleaner.  It is very uncommon for me to hate on a movie.  The exceptions of course being the prequels to my beloved Star Wars.  I'll hate on those all day.<br /><br />I think I'll wait for them to legalize pot in my state.  Then I'll try watching it again in another ten years.<br /><br />It can't be any worse than it is already.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book can't wait to read the next one. This book was hard to put down cause I wanted to know what was going to happen next
B00782O7IY|5.0|Great movie, well deserved the Oscar, the dog is adorable, would make an excellent Christmas present for any age or even for people with limited English knowledge (I meant the movie, not the dog...I don't think he is for sale..:)
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This has become one of my daughter's (9 years) favorite movies.  I love that she has a great movie with such an inspirational story to share with her friends when she has company over.  There should be more movies out there like this for children and pre-teens.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I try to do a puzzle every night. I had been playing for months now. It's a nice thinking game.<br />Unfortunately, after Amazon's latest app store update I lost all my progress.
0547884591|5.0|It is official!!  I have a serious mancrush on Tim Ferriss.  I have his other books and this one is his best yet.  There is so much good stuff to try out and experiment with.  I would encourage readers to be ready to take notes and just enjoy the ride.  As with any book you read, some stuff really resonates with you while other stuff you just take a pass on.  I appreciate someone else making all the mistakes so I have a better opportunity to succeed.<br /><br />To those who complain there is not info. on cooking.  I would encourage them to do their research prior to buying the book.  Tim clearly promoted the fact that this is a Swiss Army knife of many different topics and cooking was just a method of formatting and articulating the material.<br /><br />Finally, previous readers of Tim's books can see how Tim has really matured as an author and really had a great groove writing this book.  Please know all his books are great but, this one makes me want to supplement my digital version with a hardcover version.<br /><br />Congrats Tim.
0547884591|5.0|Outstanding! Fun to read and incredibly inspirational! I've got big plans now, and what the heck...I might even learn to cook!
0307383415|5.0|Gave me greater understanding of President Obama's challenging childhood and the difficulty of deciding which culture he would invest his life in.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|Great song, catchy tune, and a quick and easy buy via Amazon.  Also, tune in to Youtube to see the many great film clips with different groups singing this song.
B009CPES4I|4.0|An amusement, a trifle, but fun, especially for Anglophiles, mostly for watching seasoned pros--Dench, Smith, Nighy--show off their stuff.  Wilkinson, in perhaps the most serious role, is best of all, which is no surprise, if you've seen Michael Clayton.
0553801473|5.0|Can this guy write a &#34;bad&#34; book?  I don't think so.  What an adventure!  Keep on disfiguring your heros.  I love it.
6305657947|4.0|I know many love the original, but I found Steve McQueen badly miscast.  I didn't believe for a moment either that he was a bored tycoon or that he felt passionate about her.  Brosnan is perfect.  Russo is first-rate (and hot).  The heist theme is immensely more clever.  Maybe it all depends on whether you look down your nose at happy endings.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|Good for the beach.  This series was better when it dealt just with Henry VIII. It somehow lacked the juice the others had, but was fun to read.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book arrived in mint condition & delivery was very prompt!  Love the series - captivating reading.  Characters are a bit involved but there's an index to help you sort it all out.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Not for people not fond of sex scenes in books. A captivating story involving romance and play with BDSM, playing with what is and is not acceptable in todays society at large.
B0095R64AO|1.0|Slow, boring.  Waste of $1.99.  Glad I did no opt for Hd for one dollar more. Pick another movie to watch.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|We really enjoyed the movie- had a lot of laughs. I think there'll be a part 2, but not sure we'd be into it
0547884591|5.0|Awesome book. You can't go wrong with Tim Ferriss.I have 4 hour work week, 4 hour body. I had to get this one.. I was right.
B007PBL9KC|4.0|Good background album for work. Had it play thru around 10 times the other day when me and my crew were in and out of that work space. Nice chill music.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Great item, would like it a little longer in inches -- that's why I only gave it 4 starts, otherwise it works well<br />GP
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a great way to blow off steam or just give yourself a break. I was very impressed when I tried this app on a nook. I got a Kindle Fire and bought this app, maybe first. It's been almost a year &amp; I still have fun with it.<br /><br />There are a lot of options in each tool category (e.g., drawers, stickers, paper). This is a great basic app for creating something just for fun.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Great action packed book. Can get a little too detailed at times but captivating none the less. Definitely a great winter read.
B004SBX112|3.0|Old review:  This was not what I paid for. A season oriented game without seasonal updates is pointless. The recent update won't let me even open the game. When I could play it, it was fun.<br /><br />Update: After a few tries of updating and re-installing, the game is working well again. I've fallen out of the habit of playing, but did try multiple holidays and levels to revise my review. The seasons are cute enough and the graphics are of good quality. I do wish the change between games and reset of games went faster.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great action packed book. Can get a little too detailed at times but captivating none the less. Definitely a great winter read.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|my 5 year old really likes playing the game. He could never put it down. He loves the bad piggies.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman is one of those magical Christmas stories that has become a firm family favorite, and I have been watching it every Christmas for many years now. My almost eight-year-old daughter has become a fan too, watching it since she was a toddler. It has been wonderful to see her changing expressions, from interest and wonder, to poignancy as the story draws to an end.<br /><br />This 1982 London's Channel 4 production has David Bowie providing the introduction to the story which has no dialogue, only background music, a lovely score composed and conducted by Howard Blake. The story tells of an English boy's magical encounter with a snowman who comes to life one night. The boy had built the snowman earlier that day and at the strike of twelve midnight, the snowman comes to life and is invited into the boy's home where the pair proceed to indulge in some hilarious antics. The snowman is captivated by all that he sees and touches - electric switches, the boy's parents' wardrobe, and many more. Though there is no dialogue, anyone can appreciate the story by the expressive facial expressions on the snowman and the boy, and young children especially will delight in the pair's antics.<br /><br />Later that same night, the snowman takes the boy on  a magical ride in the sky, over snow-capped terrain, and into a world filled with beauty and wonder. This is a must-watch film, for it attests to the power of a vivid imagination and reinforces the notion of affection and the bonds of friendship.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Ben Goldacre knows how to make a readable book. It's very informative and Ben methodologically explains how drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients. All the tricks are explained: f.i. drugrep visits to doktors and witholding information on trials.<br />Very clear and nicely written.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|good game pretty easy.  it's good for all ages if u like playing games this is for you. If you start this game you will be on it for a long time.
B0068TJLSY|2.0|I found this movie hyped and kind of lazy. Not all is bad, the idea is good (the kind of short novel/story made into a movie worse than the book).
B007ZD17XO|4.0|The effects are really neat and it's a great game except for the ever-present minute time limit that gets old in a hurry...
B006W0QOF2|4.0|A bit bleak, good but not really memorable. It is a movie where you feel there is some potential (the actress is good), perhaps the director, yet not completely developed. I give four stars because of this potential, but it is not a movie to remember. Watchable for sure.
0547884591|5.0|Solid book love the meta section. All of Tim's books are great; check them out. I recommend this book to anyone there is something for a myriad of people so don't be shy. This is well printed and full color pictures and great price.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Good actors make a not so ambitious ''travel'' movie very watchable. Not a big issue plot or<br />thriller but occasionally makes one think a little about the meaning of life. Better than one expects.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these game's. I stay entertained for hours. My kids love to play all the games too. It s family fun game to play that everyone can enjoy. We have competition of who can get the higher score in certain games.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Shallow, entertaining and set in Hawaii. I recommend it but don't expect a serious movie about our times. The kids are good and<br />George Colooney is himself in a positive way.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I recommend this app especially if you have notes for school you could copy all your notes then later on if you forgot them you have them on your device
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Great buy very pleased with my purchase thank you Amazon, we now have the total set. I can't wait to watch this one.
B00005LOUP|5.0|my mom just love the grinch, so i thought it would be nice to buy it, thanks for your help to give my mom a present.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|I am a Ken Follett fan so maybe this review is a little biased! I am only half way through the book and have not wanted to put it down. The plots thicken as we see the next generation of the families and characters from 'Fall Of Giants'  forced to face yet another World War. Again, we read and learn about the devastation and cruelty that war brings about. The Spanish civil war, the rise and fall of Fascism, the complexities of Communism leading up to the introduction to Atomic weapons are all depicted through the lives and trials of the British, American,German and Soviet families who are allies and enemies but  intertwined and connected through past hardships and loves. A fascinating insight into how the dramas of WW11 unfolded and a great way to learn the history of these turbulent events.
B002X3V4P2|3.0|Nice album, although Watrmark and Shephard Moon are still my favorites.  I always enjoy hearing her beautiful, calming voice and her haunting melodies.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot of fun it reminds me of pioneerville or frontierville on facebook lol its not like the original orgen trail but still fun

B0076DCT2G|3.0|never thought I'd say this, but, the Corey character is great, the stories are getting old and repetitive. The ending was incomplete and unsatisfying. Seemed like NDM just wanted to get it done and set up the next one in the line.
B001QWBM62|3.0|I think this is probably a quality piece of equipment, but I have found it quite difficult to master the intricacies of operating the unit.  Time will probably solve the problem.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|The show is great,the dvd's are fine,not a ton of extras on them.It would be nice to have less disc switching when watching the show, 2 episodes per disc seems small.Probably could have done all 10 episodes on 2 disc to save switching hassle and package size.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Dont get me wrong, Pi (as an adult) appears to be a wonderful person - probably a good father and husband and teacher. However, if (as the story portrays) he was touched as deeply by the desolate and constantly life-challenging circumstances at sea with the tiger, Richard Parker, he would (as an adult) be the biggest conservationist on the planet based out of India saving every last (of the few) wild bengal tigers. Because he isn't, I am ultimately left at the end feeling like 'has he really learned anything?'<br /><br />I recommend leaving the theater moments after Pi tells Richard Parker \\"we are dying.\\" Because in the real world, more often than not, there are no hollywood endings - especially for bengal tigers.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I started reading this when the movie came on tv for Thanksgiving.  The background stories you do not get in the movie and parts of the story makes it worth reading if you love (or hate) the movie.  I will now want to read the other books about Oz by L Frank Baum.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Just cant stop playing it ,It is such a great game to play when there is nothing else to do,besides it has great graphics and response on my Kindle Fire . Highly recommended .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a game which will challenge you to think ahead.  It gets more difficult as more colors are initiated.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was a pretty good read and sucked me in to buy the other two books.  There is a good amount of adult content in it and I wouldnt recommend for younger readers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play and will give you hints if you run into trouble.  The best of the two free one offered.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|The quality of this product was disappointing. The instructions was not easy to use.I returned and purchased another product .
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This a great game.  Lots of games to play and can replay to try to beat the time.  Will keep you busy for a long long time.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|They are very cheap, and they do seem to help me out a little bit. I've had these for a couple years and they work as advertised. They aren't annoying in anyway unlike some other controller add ons. I would buy them since it doesn't really cost much at all.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I can see why this series won awards.  I highly recommend watching. Can't wait for season 2 to come out on dvd.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The only reason i give this thing 4 stars is because sony needs to redesign the controller a little bit. In general though, you can't beat the price on amazon. It works just like that other ps3 controller you had but probably smashed because call of duty and battlefield pissed you off.
B0086WQNZ0|5.0|Beautiful, just beautiful. A lifetime worth of pure, idiosyncratic beauty by the wonderful eloquent Gould. I  enjoyed allmost as much as the music itself the interviews and dvd's. To cherish forever.
B000BPFBVW|3.0|Great recording (90%) and most of the music (80%) is right on the money BUT there comes a time when you might have to consider hanging it up! There's a couple of tunes on this album that sound like poor ole Ray is 150 years old, it's just not right. If you like to supporting cast you won't be dissatisfied but if not, don't go there!
B009157BWU|4.0|We watched this film with several girl scout trrops ranging in age from 7-12. We picked this movie b/c we figured animals would be a safe genre they all would enjoy.  Kept everyone's interest and they all seemed to enjoy. The person who enjoyed it best was one of our mom's (science teahcer) who wan't supposed to stay but couldn't leave until it was over. (She was hooked).  All the girls were really rooting for Oscar and it was also educational. Overall a great film.
B007JQLNXG|1.0|Not something I would suggest to buy. Lost on stage with a full orchestra is not a pretty thing to whitness! Save your money for something better.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Great cast! Johnny Depp is sooo good! A different take on the actual TV series. I really enjoyed the movie. I watched it to the end!
0345803485|3.0|I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  All the nurses at the hospital love this book.  It was all the talk in the hospital for weeks.  So my wife read it and couldn't finish it.  I thought I'd pick it up, and it definitely wasn't for me.  The writing isn't polished, and I'm not into the S&M stuff.<br /><br />I do give her props though.  In a very difficult book-selling world, she has sold a ton of books and helped keep my local bookstore in business.  That definitely means something!
0761169431|4.0|This book comes with a TON of origami designs and includes papers in the back.  And pre-teen boy would love this!  I purchased for a 12 year old boy.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|\\"Food, Inc.\\" is a very interesting documentary that examines the current state of mass-produced food in today's society.  We eat every day, but do we really know where our food comes from?  This movie explores how government supported mass-produced food is making us all less healthy, in addition to negatively impacting our environment and the animals that become our hamburgers, sandwiches, and steaks.  It's an exhaustive (but not exhausting) documentary that should be viewed by everyone.  My only complaint is that the movie could have been edited a little bit, as it got a tad long in the end.<br /><br />If you enjoy this movie, I strongly recommend that you read [[ASIN:0395977894 Fast Food Nation]].  This fascinating book details how today's fast food marketplace is corrupt and destroying people's lives, in more ways than you may know.  McDonald's is the main culprit here.  Strongly recommended.
B009UQCGTS|3.0|5 stars for the show-0 stars for Amazon!  I love this show and am trying to catch up on one that was interrupted by football on my DVR, so purchased through Amazon.  Waste of $1.99!!!  It was taking FOREVER to download to my Kindle, so tried to watch instantly on my laptop and it kept stopping to load or connect.  The sound was also out of synch with the video.  I stream video a lot, so I know there isn't a problem with my internet connection.  Super annoying, I will look elsewhere on the internet next time before I buy anything like this from Amazon.
0143113100|5.0|The book, \\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\" is written by Norman Doidge, M.D. Doidge is a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and researcher at Columbia University for Psychoanalytic Training and Research in New York and the University of Toronto's department of psychiatry. He is also an author, essayist, and a poet. \\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\" deals primarily with brain plasticity. Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to change through learning and experience. Doidge writes that our brain is able to learn new things, overcome disabilities, and recover despite the long held belief that our brain was fixed. The book does a great job explaining topics in a simple way. Instead of the book being heavily loaded with scientific terms, Doidge was able to break down the science so readers from all types of backgrounds will be able to enjoy and understand.<br />For many years, neuroscientists believed that functions of the brain were localized.  In other words, each part of the brain has its own role and function.  This theory is not entirely wrong because scientists discovered that there are certain areas that are responsible for certain functions. However, new studies have shown that the brain is plastic. If a certain pathway in the brain is damaged, the brain has the ability to find alternative pathways and adapt to the change. Doidge includes personal stories of several patients who prove that plasticity exists. One of the patients name is Cheryl Schiltz who's vestibular apparatus, a sensory organ for the balance system, was not working. To treat her condition, she received an artificial receptor that developed new paths and learned to recognize objects, perspective, and movement. As a result, it can be seen that the sensory cortex is plastic and adaptable to change. Another patient, Barbara Arrowsmith Young had exceptional abilities that co-existed with retardation. She began to exercise her weak areas simply by practicing certain exercises to strengthen her disabilities. She practiced cognitive assessments to sharpen her brain and was able to overcome her disabilities.  Through case studies, Doidge shows how the brain is malleable, thus it is plastic.<br />Much of the content that is discussed in the book has been covered in our class. Doidge mentions the action potential, and states that the neurons that fire together are the ones that wire together and are therefore stronger. The \\"use it or lose it\\" principle is mentioned when discussing cognitive assessments, as done in Barbara's case study. If we learn a new skill but never practice it, we lose it. Most common example of this phenomenon deals with language. If we acquire the skill of learning a new language but decrease the usage of if later on in life, we will forget to speak it. Doidge also discusses the communication between the brain and the nervous system, sensory and motor function, and functions of frontal lobes. Much of this is discussed in Cheryl Schiltzs' condition since sensory and motor receptors played a large part in her disability. The book introduces new material, but Doidge includes well-written and explained background information that was discussed in class beforehand.<br />If readers are looking for an interesting, yet light read that deals with neuroscience, I would highly recommend \\"The Brain that Changes Itself.\\" I especially liked how almost each chapter had a personal story of patients that dealt with disorders, but were able to overcome them through neuroplasticity. Barabara Arrowsmith Young was one of the personal stories who was labeled to be \\"retarted\\" before she learned how to get better. She suffered from many problems; her Broca's area was not functioning properly, she lacked spatial reasoning and had a kinesthetic problem, she had a visual disability, and most of all, she had trouble understanding grammar, math concepts, logic, and cause and effect. However, she forced herself to work through her disabilities. She developed a system in which she underwent hours of assessments that helped brain functions that are weak. Essentially, she was able to change her brain through learning. I think that by including personal, success stories, I was more intrigued in reading the book. If someone is looking for specific research on brain plasticity, this book is highly recommended. Not only does the book talk about neuroplasticity, but major discoveries of neuroscience are also included. The long held belief that we are born with neurons that will never grow is now old information. The book discussed points that are highly discussed in the area of neuroscience without making the reader feel like they are reading a scientific research paper.<br />In conclusion, I enjoyed the book very much.  It was fascinating to read how neuroplasticity was rejected so many times by other scientists and now we read about it in our textbooks. Thanks to that breakthrough, thousands of lives were changed. Through neuroplasticity, patients are able to work with the areas that are weak and have them progress. The idea of that itself is fascinating enough because it makes me wonder what kinds of technology and new approaches we will have in the future. \\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\"  is a read that provides an important discovery and the truly fascinating function and adaptability of the human brain.
B009KHCT94|3.0|Don't take this seriously at all, the special effects are good but the plot is pretty thin compared to Moon with Sam Rockwell which has much more depth as a low budget sci fi. Iron Sky is a pretty decent film for the budget the studio had, just watch it and then continue business as usual. I would rather have watched Moon again.
0547884591|5.0|I love Tim Ferriss's past books.<br /><br />This book really completes the series of \\"Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise\\"<br />a trilogy.<br /><br />I wasn't as interested in the actual cooking aspect as seeing Tim's journey from novice to expert (top 5%)<br /><br />It's also a beautiful book :)
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I looked forward to sit and read every night. It would be difficult for keds though because of the many characters and countries involved.  The facts of the history are spot on and Follett is creative in how he ties the fiction with the actually events.

B007N5YIUS|1.0|What really sucks is that if you don't connect to the internet every 30 days, your game won't work. This is VERY difficult when you're deployed and CAN'T get on the internet to update your apps. Amazon says this is the publisher's fault which is why I'm giving this addictive game 1 star.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This two CD set catalogues a most amazing life story - told by friends and intimate companions of The Beatles and George Harrison as well as first person interviews with George, Paul and Ringo.  There is a marvellous spiritual aspect to the story that is plainly expressed without the haughtiness of many spiritual or religious endeavors.  The production is an artistic collage of  films and interviews - many of which were previously unreleased. It is not only a testament to Harrison's musical genius -  it  is an inspiration regarding the human spirit.

B005721Y7Y|5.0|dear amazon, i like the american beauty movie a lot. its not really a comedy but some scenes were quite funny. there's this guy who's in love with that girl who lives next door. hes a strange guy who likes looking at flying plastic bags carried by the wind for over 5 minutes. mom said he would be a probably be a good frind for me. theres that pretty chearleader also, she plays in that funny movie with the guy and the pie, that was a silly movie but i like it. mom told me her name in the movie not her real name, mom says her name is mena suvari. oh wow she is pretty! but not as much as marcy though. i think that girl was in love with her frind's father but he prefers playing with himself in the shower. he had a dream of seeing her naked and covered with roses. oh boy how i would've love to move away some of these roses! mom said it wasnt funny. one day i will lay marcy on a bed of roses while playing some barry white. anyway, the movie is good, sometimes its funny and sometimes its sad but the girl is pretty<br /><br />your frind kent

B00917IQFY|4.0|For three albums - Heat Treatment (1976), Stick to Me (1977) and Squeezing Out Sparks (1979) - Graham Parker and The Rumour were one of the very best bands in the world. Great songs delivered with passion and huge intensity. Sure, they lacked subtlety - everybody played all through all the songs - but it was so full-on, so exciting that it didn't matter.<br /><br />What happened? Lack of the commercial success they richly deserved led to frustration and to problems with their record company. Other acts in approximately the same genre (notably Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson) succeeded to a much greater extent. Just when GP&TR should have been stepping up another level to compete, they stepped down with a mediocre record, The Up Escalator (1980). They soon broke up, and GP embarked on a moderately successful solo career, but he never recaptured the early magic.<br /><br />So a new album from GP&TR, their first in 32 years, is a hugely enticing prospect, but also a rather risky one for a fan devoted to those three classic albums. My expectations from GP&TR are so high that there is not much chance they can be met.<br /><br />And so it proves. The album is nothing like their great 1970s trio. It's produced by much older men - slower, quieter more reflective. It reminds me of much of GP's solo work, in fact. So it's pretty good to very good (as is almost all of GP's solo work), but there are no sparks being squeezed out, and they are not pouring it all out. It's a good album, but if you were hoping to rekindle that adrenaline-rush feeling that GP&TR used to generate in the late 1970s, you'll be disappointed. If you like intelligent, witty songs performed by great musicians, you'll enjoy this.

B009EE13R2|4.0|Hello dolly needs no defense, it is as spectacular and fun for me now as it ever was. My beef is with the streaming and download. I downloaded to my iPad since streaming from my home system was a little slow and thought I could take the iPad with me to Thanksgiving to play the movie for relatives, but as of now Amazon digital videos downloaded to iPad are not compatible with an Apple TV setup. I am going to figure out a different way to go about it - perhaps import the video to my Itunes and then play?

B005FPT51K|5.0|We also read all of the reviews, but two who had hooked it up properly gave it good reviews.  Since this monitor was very adaptable with night vision camera, audio and alerts, we decided to order it for our great grandchild's room. We figured we would just return it if it didn't work.  My son in law had it connected quickly and with no problems.  He also fixed my iPhone so I am seeing baby in live mode nearly 2000 miles away!  There was some question about the router being strong enough so we also purchased a new wireless router taking advantage of black friday sales. Router was connected first, then the monitor.  It is awesome.  Audio is great, photo is great.<br />This has been a great purchase.  If you are not super techie, ask a friend who is to help with the set up, you'll be glad you did.<br />I tried to send a screen shot, but it wasn't video so didn't work.
0547884591|5.0|Everything by Tim Ferriss is just pure gold. It's also a beautiful book with lovely images and artwork. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to excel in life.
0547884591|4.0|The newest 4 hours are looking just as eye opening as the previous Tim Ferris crash courses in life. I am inspired to add classy meals to my chef game and I can't wait to read more in the wild section. As always you will get more than you would guess from Ferris and if you are up for it grow as a well rounded human.
0553801473|4.0|*EDIT* Review revised based on helpful user feedback<br /><br />I believe Dance With Dragons presents another strong entry into George Martin's world. My enjoyment was heightened partially do to anticipation just to get my hands on another entry after waiting so long after the last book. If you are reading the series for the first time back to back then you may not share this same sense of 'giddiness'.<br /><br />After A Feast For Crows I relished the opportunity to get reacquainted with quite a few character's POV chapters that were absent in the previous entry. It felt like getting to see an old friend again after spending some time away.<br /><br />I was happy with the progress Martin made in this entry and believe it sets up 'Winds Of Winter' to begin the conclusion of the overall plot.<br /><br />I originally had this review as five stars but after reading some of the criticism from fellow users I have to agree on one point in particular. Martin far too often repeats words or phrases for certain characters to the point where it annoys and especially makes rereading difficult. At this point we don't need to be reminded that Dany is a somewhat naive young girl or that Tyrion is upset with his father (repeating 'Where do whores go' a ridiculous amount). Martin seems to forget sometimes that we have already read 4000 pages of this saga before ever picking up book five.<br /><br />Otherwise I enjoyed the book very much and look forward to picking up the next entry (two years from now). Thanks to all the users who left feedback to my original review as well.
0547848412|5.0|Just finished The Life of Pi. I was almost brought to tears by the ending. Let me also state that I am an average guy--happily married with children, drive a Mustang, enjoy sports, etc. This book is one powerful mix of spirituality, psychology, and the horror of reality. I believe anyone would be moved by this boy's story and the way it is told. I am not so sure I agree with the way the book and the movie are being marketed as a great adventure.  The book was a hugely popular read before the film was made--I would think the studio and the publisher creating the movie tie-in paperback would have been able to sell the story for what it really is. And, no, I am not confused by the conclusion of the book.  It is clear what the writer intended, and I will be asking myself for the next few weeks (years?), would my own sense of spiritually sustain me in a time of real crisis?  I strongly recommend The Life of Pi.

0547884591|4.0|If you've ever read Tim Ferris's other works then you know his books don't follow the straightest line from A to B. On that note, if you like immersing storytelling throw in with your cooking lessons(among other things), then you'll definitely enjoy this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This Flow Free is tons of fun and very addictive. While it is free to download and start playing, it costs money if you want more hints or more games. Easy to spend tons of money in a night without realizing it - on a very simple app game!
B009HELT3C|5.0|The movie kept me interested the whole time and had a great ending. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a great team.I'd recommend it.
0345803485|1.0|As a prize-winning internet author on SOL, I could be accused of professional jealousy for hating this book so much - but the reasons are good ones! I think this really does pollute and damage the book industry - lots of talented writers out there who can't get published because people are so easily satisfied by slush like this, and she probably only made it because she was a TV executive with contacts. A lot of people in the publishing industry, as well as would-be writers are thinking this way, and I see a lot of sexually and romantically mature females on the 'I hate 50 Shades' page of Facebook who find it laughable.<br />It took me a while to pinpoint why it got under my skin so badly: the hypocrisy of it. It's the pretence of it being something noble and romantic, when in reality the type of woman portrayed by Anastasia would look at a guy like a cockroach if he flirted like Christian Grey, if he was not good-looking and rich (or at least one of those things). If Ana had been saying \\"I'm looking for a mega-rich guy with Greek God looks, and that's why nobody else has been good enough for me so far,\\" from the start, I wouldn't have minded so much, as at least the novel would have been psychologically honest, and if EL James could write decent prose then it might even have been a dramatic portrayal of a mercenary woman kind of 'coming of age' and learning her power.<br />It can't even be defended, unlike Brown or Archer (or indeed it's literally less-incompetent parent, 'Twilight'), on the basis of it being good storytelling, because it's not. Girl meets boy and we have to read about them 'getting it on' (in a quirky and unconvincing way) for the rest of the book. No thanks. I did not want to spend any more time in the sexually dysfunctional head of EL James, and yet another mention of 'Inner Goddess' on page 213, coupled with another put-down of a nice-guy suitor who was playing by the normal rules, ended it abruptly for me.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|good action, pretty fast-paced, some surprises, a great cast, super special effects, and a good ending!  I would definitely watch it again.

0547884591|5.0|Is Tim Ferris a master of hype as his critics say? Yes. Does it stop this from being a killer book? No.<br /><br />Here's the thing - right now this book is $21. It'll go up later, but basically all you're paying for is the cost of printing and shipping. And that shipping alone can't be cheap because this thing is MASSIVE! Not to mention gorgeously printed. My only complaint is that there are a few too many pictures of Tim himself, but whatever. I haven't gone through and counted the recipes, but there are a lot. Let's really limit it for the sake of argument and say there are 42. If so, that would mean you could also see it as paying $0.50 per recipe. Some of these recipes you'd pay $65 to enjoy at a fancy restaurant.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but the point there is WITHOUT even getting into the content, this book shows incredible value.<br /><br />THEN there's the juice: How to learn.<br /><br />Learning how to learn sounds trivial on the surface, but it is in fact one of life's most invaluable skills. Tim presents this kind of meta-learning in a way that isn't intimidating and that can be applied to almost any area in life - language learning, dancing, marketing, whatever. Imagine not feeling intimidated, but excited when you've got a new skill to learn. Every time you learn one thing all the rest of the things become that much easier to learn. People (and I know from personal experience) pay tens upon tens of thousands of dollars to get this kind of information from University and Grad School, and most of them STILL don't actually learn this.<br /><br />So what would you pay to for that? More than $21 I'd guess.<br /><br />Even if you hate the book, it's so damn big it'd probably take 4 hours to throw in the fireplace and burn all the way through - just enough time to have made a delicious meal for a sexy-time date and to snuggle in front of the final smoldering ashes on your bearskin rug. Boom - the 4 Hour Chef just got you laid.

0062127241|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, what a great, fast and uncomplicated read, cover to cover, a real page turner and it took me by surprise as Pete seems to be a complex persona but his penmanship, or reading it, was effortless. We are fortunate to have Pete around as he has engagingly communicated a sense of artistic freedom, independent thought and observation; rock music became socio-political in nature by an exuberant embrace of freedom of expression. Reading, I felt an artist and man at work; a dynamic exploring of a myriad of inventive realities as necessary `food' for inspired creation and analysis. His creative process, I found especially fascinating and I am glad he devoted time to the interplay with this and his external life. Yes, artists may be self orientated and driven, but so what? Their contribution to my world is their art and the freedom to express themselves via a variety of artistic media. This synthesis is their gift to us and Pete's gift has been great. A good book for those involved in the artistic process as well as those curious about the personal side of Pete and the history of The Who.

B004MYFV0O|5.0|Ok so I am one of the many ppl who thinks daily,\\"I can't draw...\\" or at least I did think that. Not any more! I took the time each day, only 30 mins, just before bed to read and draw. You want to know something? My first lesson had my mates saying, \\"Dude thats really good!\\". So if it helped me it WILL help you. And really, it's FUN!
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|OMG I was bored watching this movie. I found the characters to be dull, emotionless and one dimensional. I found the script to be anything but inspiring. I found the music to be desperately trying to pump emotion into a nearly lifeless storyline. I really don't see the draw for this film; I think it would have worked much better as a documentary.<br /><br />Did anyone notice that the lighting for the baseball on-field scenes looked totally staged; not at all what a live game (on TV) looks like.  And why did I have to listen to the character of Billy Beane's daughter sing that silly song...twice?!<br /><br />Wow...really...much ado about nothing.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ana was a bit annoying to me.  Christian told her from the very beginning who he was and what he wanted.  She went into the relationship with eyes wide open, but spent so much time trying to change Christian.  I didn't particularly like Christian's character either, but at least he was honest.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Love it!  ...and looking forward to War of the Damned.

0736063684|4.0|I was impressed by the illustrations presented in this book, but mostly by the detailed discussion of exercises and anatomy presented.This book could be an outstanding reference work for professionals such as personal trainers or physical therapists. It provides excellent graphics for multiple exercises within each muscle group.<br /><br />This book tho is outdated since there is 3rd edition out now.
B000E97X66|5.0|I read many reviews about this being a \\"breakthrough\\" moment for Bruce and the E Street band. I only had to listen to the album one time to understand why people wrote about it that way.  He performs four of my favorite songs on this album (Thunder Road, Kitty's Back, Jungle Land, and For You)  and each one is sung with a passion and urgency you won't hear on any other live album.  All of the songs are well done, of course.  Everybody has their favorites. His rendition of \\"4th of July\\" is another one that demands listeners to hit the \\"repeat\\" button more than once. This is a serious concert.  It is a fun concert.  You won't be disappointed when listening to this album.  It belongs in the collection of any Springsteen fan.

I look forward to the next instalment of this five part story.
B007FZ7R7W|3.0|This CD is not like Chris Brown's older CDs. Yes every artist grows and so does their music but I was expecting GREATNESS like he delivers every CD previously. Maybe next CD he will break out again. :/
B00825921I|3.0|I read this book having heard an extract read on radio, As I had never previously read a book by this author I felt this was a good book to start with. My overall opinion is that this story is somewhat contrived and the ending was fairly easy to guess way before it was reached
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Where I am I don't have much of an option of playing songs on repeat for hours on end from dawn until dusk BUT I wish I could with this CD! Emeli Sande's voice is absolutely beautiful!

0345350499|5.0|I recieved this book as a gift from a friend. I have always loved the Arthurian legends and she knew how much I would enjoy this retelling. I love that the book is written from the view point of the women. I have never been very fond of Guinevere (here a different spelling of course) but I came to understand her differently thanks to this story. It seems to be all encompassing. And I find myself at times disappointed in both Morgain and Arthur for their lack of or overabundance of conviction in one way or another. The story is written in such a way that one cannot help but be drawn in completely by the characters and the unfolding drama. It really is an amazing retelling of something as old as any legend. A truely lovely and unique reimagining of such an ancient and deep rooted mythology.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|Very inspirational! Got it for my bf ( he works as a sushi chef and wants to grow) he loved it

How my love for the Marvel movies has grown.<br /><br />What can I say?  I'm cheap.<br /><br />So I finally cracked the piggy bank and rented it on Amazon Instant Video.  Boy was I not let down.  This movie was all it was hyped up to be.  I should, I hope, be purchasing this movie so it can be watched over and over again.  Just one thing stands in the way of that.<br /><br />Cheap.  Me that is.

B009IU6N5Y|4.0|I fell asleep watching this, but what I saw was just what I like. there was violence and patriotism. I love the idea of this movie, but it didn't quite match up to what I thought it would be.
B00979CS50|4.0|I've been a long-time Neil Young fan and especially a fan of his albums with Crazy Horse.  So getting my hands on a copy of Psychedelic Pill after such a long hiatus was a good feeling indeed.<br /><br />The first song on the album, Driftin' Back, made me wonder however if something had gone terribly wrong.  The song seems to be completely devoid of the raw energy that characterizes Crazy Horse albums in the Neil Young catalogue.  Neil's voice even sounds frail and thin.  It's like they are just going through the motions on this one.  Had the septegenerian proto-grunge gods finally run their course?  Was it time to put Crazy Horse out to pasture? (sorry had to do that one)<br /><br />Twenty-seven minutes later, I had the answer:  No.  A resounding NO.<br /><br />The rest of the album is absolutely amazing.  It's just as powerful and energizing as ever.  There is a lot of different types of material on this album so no one can say they are a one-track mind.  The chemistry between them is still there.  The insane feedback-drenched guitar genius is still there.  It's all still there.  I was relieved.

B009JBZH54|5.0|This is an incredible Trilogy set at an amazing price.. I paid $29 (only $4 more than \\"Dark Knight Rises\\" alone).. The bonus features are amazing, I just got this today so I still have much to see!<br /><br />The case that holds everything together is very high quality. Soft touch material and super cool looking. I highly recommend these films and this Trilogy set. Christopher Nolan is a God among men.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|Very slow. The only reason I kept reading was because I knew it was coming out in the Theaters and I hoped it would get better.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey brings a crucial stage of British history to life.  A social system built on the medieval need for a warrior class had become a pharisaic set of empty rules impossible to maintain in an industrial age.  The series illustrates a breakdown of class barriers which continues to this day, not to mention the struggles over political rights and the transition from an agricultural society to an urbanized modern world.<br /><br />The characterization is magnificent.  The study of the things in life that can't be avoided is met bravely.  You become immersed in the lives and loves of this complex family and adopt them as your own.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good little weather app but needs a landscape mode<br />what ' I have to add more words in order to submit opinion?
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. Very inspiring for young girls. My daughter loves this movie. In fact we bought it.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a great movie for the kids and family. My kids love the story and the animation is superb.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|My order arrived in good condition and my the DVD's will be enjoyed in the years to come. Thank you.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Difficult to change the city--not very impressed so far.  Haven't been able to use it very much due to the programming limitations.
B0034G4P80|5.0|My order was in great condition and will be enjoyed in the  years to come. Thank you so much for theMarvel fan.
B0087YPCYA|1.0|I regret paying 5 dollars on this movie...Does not worth it...<br />Not good as action, horror or even porn movie.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I've used this on two smartphones now and it's still my primary calendar app -- and it's free. Customize it to suit your needs. Step through various calendar displays from daily to monthly, with color coding and \\"marks\\" and some icons. Also lists of important dates and notes at the bottom. Transferred easily from old to new smartphone. Like it much better than Google's since I don't share my calendar data with anyone. All in all, a very good and useful app. Recommended!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Left me wanting more.  I hope Brandon writes another with these characters.  He definitely left it open for the possibility.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm so in love with them if she doesn't choose Peeta I'm going to be mad. He is so sweet.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I am not even halfway through and I have already fallen in love with David Mitchell`s writing and story. Awakens the curious explorer in anybody.
B0053O89XI|5.0|It's a great tv show! And if you have a bluray player, why not getting it in a good quality!<br />If you're considering buying this product, you probably have the other 4 seasons, so I guess you don't need me to explain why it's good.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|So many great features, I love it. Use it multipli times a day for several different things.  I've got about 5 alarms promgramed right now, I think.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I did like their previous release a bit more, but this cd is great. This band deserves to be known worldwide, i recomend you either buy the cd, or at least the mp3's.<br />Listen to the previews (you can do so if you go to the post where amazon sells the mp3 version of this cd) and you'll get a better idea of Halestorm's style.
B000089RVX|5.0|My daughter loves this CD and was thrilled that she received as a gift. The music is fantastic. The product shipped really fast too.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This Deluxe edition, includes the bluray with the concert at London Arena, two cds with all the songs from the concert, and  an extra dvd with all the rehearsal done a couple of days before the show. It also includes a booklet with a little text about each John Paul Jones, Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and Jason Bonham, John's son (who plays the drums in this show).<br />Really enjoyable if you like Zeppelin, I've seen celebration day on the cinemas, and still i couldn't wait for this item to arrive.
0143122010|5.0|This is an important, fascinating, and -- wonder of wonders -- hopeful book that readers interested in our future as a species should take the time to read.<br /><br /> And it does take time.  Pinker wanders through many fields (archaeology, primatology, history, evolutionary biology, ethics, and on and on) to develop and support his premise: violence among human beings has fallen very sharply, not just over the long run, but in the short run too.  I found most (though not all) of the arguments and evidence he cites compelling, though I do want to check out the footnotes to get a clearer sense of his methodology (I listened to the book: have ordered hard copy).<br /><br />Another reviewer referred to Peter Singer's excellent review in the New York Times, which gives a much better impression and evaluation of the book than I can do.  ([...]).<br /><br />  To use the short form, however, I found this book engrossing, reasonable, and -- so rare in this day and age -- encouraging.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|If you like music and guitars, this documental is just for you! It features Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), The Edge (U2), and Jack White (The White Stripes) doing what they know best! You might want to see this 3 generations of musicians playing together. Just remember, this isn't a live concert, it's a documentary, so it has awesome parts, and it might get a bit...not dull, but, you know....it's a documental.<br />hope this was useful!
006091307X|5.0|I loved this book, but doubt it will lead me into a full-bore exploration of Pynchon.  It appeared 35 years ago (that does date post-modernism: the book was hailed as either an exemplar or a parody of post-modernism) and vividly captures the ethos of the time .<br /><br />But ethos isn't all there is: to enjoy this novel, you have to let yourself slide into Pynchon's very strange world.  The plot centers on  Oedipa Maas, a California woman who has been named executor of her lover's estate.  As she becomes involved in this process, she becomes more and more enmeshed in what may be a massive and long lived conspiracy, or may be her own paranoid delusion, or may be a plot to convince her that she is paranoid.  What's fascinating about the book are the side trips, into a mythic Jacobean drama, into the lives and times of a Beatlish band, into Oedipa's personal life.<br /><br />What does it all mean?  Who knows: it seems to me that it is something about humanity's efforts to impose meaning, but it could be about drugs, or California, or postal conspiracies.  Anyway it's a great trip, though it pushed me to the edge of my toleration for non-linear fiction.  And this is generally referred to as his most accessible work ------
B009YP9L7U|4.0|while the plot was predictable, i really really liked this book.  the dialog was great, it was a nice quick read.
0547884591|3.0|May I can add here some comments from outerspace (Germany)?<br />To be honest, I'm completely Tim-addicted already, have all his books and start some life hacks from time to time. (with more or less success)<br /><br />Now we have the third book and a lot of promises: \\"Cooking like a pro, learning anything, living the good life\\". Can it be so easy and 100% succesful?<br /><br />Yes, it can. If your name is Tim Ferriss, with same genetic, social and financial background as Tim Ferriss. :)<br /><br />If not, be carefull to avoid disapointing experience. First keep in mind that no serious change in your life will be super-fast and 150% successful. Second, I think Tim is a marketing genius. He knows exactly what he has to do and when and who to get our attention for his next great deal.<br /><br />I read 20% of the book and have to say it is great pleasure. Great to read, amazing pictures. But so far a cooking book with a summary of 4h week and 4h body. Not so bad, but also not so impressive. (as I though in the beginning)<br />However, I like the 80/20 idea behind all these lessons in all books. You need only 20% of your time/effort to get 80% of your work done. I'm happy to see so many practical hint and tricks to follow this principle. But these 20% can be hard work. And the gap between 80% and 100% can be important - you should keep this in mind.<br /><br />But finally, I'm here - writing a review to help Tim to get 500 reviews. And I follow up each news about 4h movement. :)<br /><br />Congratulations - great work at all.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This works just as it is intended to . The sound is awesome and i would say buy it buy it .
B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect; but it is a wonderful romance and a real education in various sexual appetites.  Not all appeal to me, but it was a fascinating read and it had a great plot and wonderful characterization.
B00979CS50|5.0|Before buying this, I went through every review. I agree that Neil has put out a bunch a sub par music over the years, so I just wanted to get a better understanding of this effort before taking yet another plunge. After listening through this three times now, I could honestly say that I am glad I did.<br />This to me is the best music Neil has put out in a very long time. I am amazed at how many people have trashed it. How can this be trashed?<br />Drifting Back? Ok, so it is 27 minutes long but it never gets old. At least not for me. I found myself lost and moving through time. The best way I could describe it was as if you were at the dentist office getting nitrous. Just bouncing around through time and memories. Is that not what music is about? Getting lost in the song? I also really enjoyed Ramada Inn. Much the same beat and almost as long but this song had some really nice harmonies and I found myself wanting more.<br />Twisted Road is also very good. She's always dancing is another decent track that again, just keeps you enjoying the sound and beat that NY & CH have brought us for so many years.<br />Let's talk Walk Like A Giant. Another very long song, that could have been at least a few minutes shorter but who cares? Can you honestly say that you have not been whistling since you have heard this? I can't get it out of my head. My wife yelled at me. What's with the whistling? Besides that, this is a very good song with decent lyrics to boot. I cringe at the bad reviews. There was even one reviewer that bashed the sound quality and the engineer. Again, anyone that truly knows this band completely understands this sound. It's part of what makes it great. It's garage band like. Raw. Simple and rustic!<br />Perhaps this effort is best suited for long drives but I really enjoyed it.
B00008WT5J|5.0|If you love AC/DC and you haven't heard these tunes yet, pony up the cash and get this one!  Ride On is one of Bon Scott's best songs.  Who Made Who is a bonus!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I could never get this one to load onto the Kindle Fire HD.<br />I like Bingo and I think I would have enjoyed this app, but it cancelled out rather than loading to the Kindle.
B000OLRH10|4.0|I was looking for a movie similar to Syriana, and this movie is not really up to par with it, but it is still an excellent movie. I'm not normally a fan of Leonardo di Caprio, but his acting was truly outstanding. The same goes for all the actors, really, but in particular also Djimon Hounsou and the child actors. The movie describes the ugliness of the conflicts in Sierra Leone and the diamond trade well. It is the ending that cheapens the movie somewhat. Maybe a fairytale ending is necessary to sell this kind of movie, but it would have been stronger without it. If you ignore the last five minutes or so this is a compelling movie, which is well worth watching, and might even be educational. I rented this movie on Amazon instant video and decided to buy the DVD afterwards.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My 12 year old son and I both read this book and reviewed it at the same time. For a child who does not like to read, this book had him hooked. It is a hit at my house.
B001NHJTKG|4.0|Great album on mp3, but I would have liked &#34;sultans of swing&#34; which is a separate purchase. But for the price you'll be very happy!
B00004TS0E|5.0|We absolutely love this Christmas movie! We love the original too with  Natalie Wood, but this is just different enough that it makes watching both of them each Christmas worthwhile. I can't imagine anyone not loving this movie!! It's pure. It's simple. It's positive. Great actors! Great location! Fun surprise ending! It's among the best!
B009IA9OLE|4.0|it seems like a lotta work went into this game. tons of fun....and then it's done. really short storyline but fun while it lasts.
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|Wasn't what I was expecting at all. Underwhelmed by the acting, plot, dialogue (especially), and so on. Wouldn't watch it again.
0547884591|5.0|What a fun book!!  Filled with tons of new and exciting things to set goals on learning... A nice way to escape the madness of daily urban lifestyle and take on something totally new and different from what most of us are typically used to doing.  THANKS TIM!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|The best zombie show I have ever seen. I look forward to seeing where the show goes on from here
B004LWZWGK|4.0|According to the listing there are currently over 300 \\"Reviews\\" for this \\"Product\\".<br /><br />Myself I'm interested in finding out about the Blu-Ray, not reviews of the movie, as I've seen it and now I want to buy a copy, which I have. However, I see in the Amazon listing there are NO SPECIAL FEATURES which means the producers at some point will ask me to purchase yet another disc or download with those features.<br /><br />So without viewing the product I just purchased, same as the other reviewers, I will give it one star. I want extras on the Blu-Ray. I also just purchased MIB3 and it would seem that it has plenty of extras.<br /><br />Thanks for listening.<br /><br />OK, I received the Blu-Ray yesterday and it would appear to have 3 hours of \\"Special Features\\". However, the Amazon page for this film under \\"Special Features\\" still says \\"None\\".<br /><br />I'm looking forward to watching this this weekend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest!  So many ideas and this ap makes it easy!  I have so many great ideas, now I just need more time to do them.
B0094FQZTM|4.0|Unlike many, I'm a fairly recent fan, really exploring all Tiamat has to offer around the time Amanethes came out four years ago.  For me, Prey and Amanethes are my favorites and this release doesn't exceed those massive gems, but certainly keeps to that level.  Note I miss in this release female vocals, which is definitely lacking.  My favorites from Prey were \\"Divided\\" and \\"Carry your cross\\" so that should give an idea.<br /><br />Another comment is to let this grow on you.  At first listen only two songs really struck me, but after repeated listens, I've become addicted to nearly all of them.<br /><br />My view is 4.5 stars on this.  If you've loved anything from Wildhoney on, this shouldn't disappoint.
B008518MOW|5.0|Let's get this out of the way right off the bat: Men in Black 3 is not nuanced, high-brow cinema. It's plagued by some of the same things as most big-budget popcorn flicks -- occasionally overdone special effects, the stray plot hole here or there, and a bit of predictability. But as long as you can put that aside, and frankly such things should be expected anyway, you'll find an extremely enjoyable and satisfyingly nostalgic movie.<br /><br />The Men in Black series seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it affair, and chances are if you enjoyed either the classic first movie or the.. well.. less than classic second movie, you'll enjoy MiB3 as well. Will Smith returns to top comedy form as Agent J, Tommy Lee Jones is as enjoyably grumpy as ever in his role as Agent K, and Josh Brolin delivers a nearly-perfect performance as a younger K. Whether Will Smith is paired up with the world-weary Jones or the brash, charming Brolin, the on-screen dynamic is always enjoyable and often hilarious.<br /><br />The occasionally wonky plot is buoyed by an interesting -- if slightly predictable -- story arc and strong acting on all parts. Overall the movie much more resembles the first movie than the second, and for those who grew up watching the original there's plenty of nostalgia to go around. By the time the resolution comes around, it makes for a very satisfying and surprisingly touching finish. Don't expect a Best Picture winner, but MiB3 has enough working for it to offer nearly everyone a highly enjoyable experience.
034580404X|5.0|Great book!!!  A must have and worth your hard earned money. A must read. I'm finshed with book one,<br />on book two.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Everything that can be said - good, bad or indifferent - has already been written about this book.<br /><br />The virtually equal spread of ratings show that people either love it or hate it. Perhaps the haters were expecting something feel-good and escapist? If so, then TV is a good option for them.<br /><br />No matter what Rowling came up with as a follow-on to Harry Potter, she really couldn't meet expectations. Perhaps she should have just published under a pseudonym (but the publishers obviously wanted to maximize the $$$).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book and look forward to whatever Rowling writes next. She is a great author and I will certainly buy her next book, whatever subject she tackles next.
B002JVWR54|5.0|Although it would have been enjoyable to see where he took the show in a season 3, Joss Whedon managed to wrap this show up in a good fashion once he got the cancellation news.
B0099116AY|4.0|I liked this movie, it was a little slow for me but the story line was cute, and i can see how this could happen after all those years of marriage.
B004LQI0HE|4.0|I watched this movie as part of a class assignment and because it has Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley in it.  It's a tear-jerker, and definitely not a happy story.  However, I enjoyed it, and it shows one side of the argument of whether or not we should clone people very well.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I initially downloaded app. because it was free.  Ive had it on my Kindle Fire for 2 weeks and use it every day.  The dictionary is very easy to use with extensive definitions and links to all types of subjects - much like Wikipedia.  I also enjoy the word games:  hangman, word match,  and Word of the Day.  IMHO the. best online dictionary I've used and an exceptionally useful app!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|so far this app has been easy fun and interesting to use! Cant wait to use it more!<br />Great for sharing your pics to the social media sites! Thanks!
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I have the Blu-ray version of this movie. The animation is great, color is brilliant. It is one of my<br />favorite movies. I watch it quite a lot. There is almost constant action as well as mystery to<br />it. The story comes from the original comics of Tintin from many years ago. Steven Spielberg<br />has promised in the extras to make other movies based on this comic character and I really<br />look forward to seeing them. I think children of all ages could watch it, but there is violence<br />throughout, a lot of bad men, so watch at your own discretion for your kids.
B0045XKJBI|2.0|This is probably the better movie of the first three simply because the movie itself is better. I'm still not sold on the actual story though.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|We never got past the 1 minute mark- we instant downloaded this while at a long layover due to a weather delay.  we were connected to the airport's wifi, but it just didnt matter, this thing would not load no matter how many times we re-started.  I'm in my 20s, and work on computers all day, so its fair to say it was not my or my mac-book's error, but something wrong with the streaming site.  Will NEVER auto-stream a movie from amazon again.

0547884591|5.0|No but really... good book. Great book actually. I'd so wish to expend a minute more to provide a more detailed review but as it is life has me (like it has most of us) busy enough (4HWW anybody:P). This is general review and not 4HC specific because I haven't made it through all of it yet. Working on it. I do own and have read quite a bit of all of TF's books and love them all. He is one of two author's that I would constantly recommend. It is typically 4HB material I rave about because, as a Marine especially, talk of \\"gettin' big\\" has me interjecting TF accomplishments in this area. (btw. about a year and a half ago i and a friend went at the weight gain with TF's methods and for the first time in my life I actually was able to gain considerable muscle - so thanks Tim!). All in all, as with anything, (and I'm sure Tim would agree) do your work. As I think he mentioned in the 4HC, allow him to guide, to get you thinking, to provide some sparks to ignite your own crazy paths of growth (workily, physically, cookily, etc.) and just roll with it. Explore. Experiment. Do something. Tim Ferriss, you're fresh. Keep up the good work buddy:)<br /><br />I definitely recommend 4HC. And 4HB and 4HWW for that matter. Also, check out TF's blog and hit up youtube for vids he's done. The Random Show is always a good kick.

1469984202|5.0|NO SPOILERS!<br /><br />Let's say this at the start: you might not just read this book, you might very well DEVOUR it.  Not only is it as readable as a novel can be, but it is worthy of some serious anti-utopian reflection along the way.  And if you need any more convincing, ask the 96 percent of readers who have given it a four- or five-star rating (and of those, the fives are overwhelming).<br /><br />\\"Wool: Omnibus,\\" a collection of his first five \\"Wool\\" short stories of varying lengths, is a book that may well serve as a model for a new kind of fiction selling: self-publication on Kindle.  It is a trend that is creating of some serious consideration, and may well produce other great works along the way.<br /><br />As the self-publication story goes, Howey produced his first work and distributed it free of charge.  When it flew off the digital shelves he bowed to public pressure and published \\"Wool 2,\\" then on and on until this collection brought all five of the original short (to long) stories together.  At this time of writing, \\"Wool\\" is selling on the Kindle for $5.99, a terrific bargain.  It's worth it at triple the price or more.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Howey's tale of life in an underground silo is both convincing and well drawn, drawing its strength from both its compelling story and its ability to construct credible characters who seem alive and propel the action.  What he is also able to do is convince his readers that he has lived the life--not necessarily that of silo dwelling, but of working with nuts and bolts of machinery and computers and pumps and whatnot.  When he describes the guts of an engine he seems to know it down to the grease and gearing; when he speaks of being starved of oxygen and on the brink of drowning it seems so real one has to wonder if the author somehow writes from personal experience.  (The author was captain of a yacht...more on that later.)<br /><br />Given the nature of \\"Wool's\\" birth, I thought it might be interesting to look at the collection individually.  There will be NO PLOT SPOILERS.<br /><br />Wool 1 (or simply \\"Wool\\" when it was originally published) is the tale of a doomed man-- its sheriff, in fact--who has run afoul of the very society he had sworn to serve.  As the book's cover copy tells you, question the society and you are \\"granted\\" what its unwavering law demands: to leave.  To do so, one must take part in a \\"cleaning\\" of the outside cameras, a task that means certain death in the hostile outdoors.  Though we do not know why this is, the environment outside the silo is almost immediately toxic, even when wearing the bulky full-bodied and helmeted suit given to those making the exodus.  As dramatic as this story was, I actually liked it least of the five, as it was the only portion whose characterization took too long to develop and ultimately didn't really matter, as the characters were leaving us.  It was still interesting, but I felt much more invested as the story continued.<br /><br />I was drawn in more by the second chapter, \\"Proper Gauge.\\"  Here the silo's new mayor is tasked with looking for a new sheriff, and what I liked best about this portion of the story is the immersion of the characters and the readers into the literal and figurative depth of the tale, as they travel down to level 140: a journey of over a day (think of the World Trade Center shoved underground).  And what a mysterious and strange place this truly is.<br /><br />Here is where the story really showed its stuff, taking us down into the beast, letting us understand better how this society runs, how the various levels are lumped into cliques with their own identities, and that this frighteningly claustrophobic place has been running not just for decades, but for so many lifetimes that its duration is really unknown.  Lastly, in this tale the beginnings of a controversy form--one that will have repercussions through the rest of the novel.<br /><br />The third tale is \\"Casting Off,\\" as a newsheriff is found and transported to her new headquarters.  Here so much happens, and personalities become very important.  I think this portion did a terrific job of furthering not just the essential plot elements, but also of detailing how the personalities of the characters are becoming.  And, very importantly, the monolithic authority of those in charge begins to show its frightening face: not just because of the laws, but those at the hub of the society who enforce them.  And if you think that means the sheriff...you're dead wrong.<br /><br />\\"The Unraveling\\" is the the part of the story that jumps this tale into overdrive and becomes an undeniable page turner.  Author Howey really shows his skill here at dividing the story into sections and alternating those sections masterfully, giving us just enough to whet our appetites and keep us pushing forward to hope for resolutions to some extremely forceful conflicts.  As I am being mindful of spoilers I will only say that the author does indeed accomplish a feat, in that he invests you in both sides of the coin, letting the readers see WHY each side believes he or she is acting in the interest of their society, however misguided their opponent views him.  This is what I found most frightening, really: that people who feel THEY know best do the things they do...supposedly, on our behalf.<br /><br />And finally there is \\"The Stranded.\\"  The longest one of the five by far, it needs every page to accomplish its feats.  Howey threads the interweaving story lines together as well as any thriller author out there.  At the same time, however, he is able to invest us in the characters at the heart of the conflicts, again displaying their motivations and their earnest beliefs that they were doing their best for those they represented.  This, we find out, is exactly how this whole thing began hundreds of years ago: because people at the heart of things thought they were SAVING us.  It's that which I find horrifying...that and the fact that much of society just mills about oblivious, like those who brought lawn chairs to view the opening battles of the Civil War.  Or, more properly, perhaps: they never even realized that a battle was taking place, and cared little even if they did.  They only want to go about their business and be left alone.  I'm talking to YOU, there, Mr. and Mrs. Undecideds...<br /><br />But as to the pace and cadence of the story, I was amazed: as I travelled closer and closer to the end I found myself becoming more and more incapable of seeing how the author was going to end this thing with any promise of fulfillment on the reader's part.  But he does just that.<br /><br />And, again, I really feel Howey did a great job of making it feel that the author knew whereof he spoke: his technical scenes create such a sense of verisimilitude that they seem entirely realistic.  While it probably has much to do with Howey's own experience as a skipper of a yacht -an occupation that probably gave him a certain amount of freedom to write as well--his former occupation created for me a certain interesting contradiction.  On the open seas, with the vast, teeming, wide ocean in front of him, how did he conceive of such a confined, teeming, claustrophobic world?  He so perfectly imagined a society that ran vertically down into the earth while the wide sea ran across the horizon in front of him--I think that is an accomplishment unto itself.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder Howey's success through Kindle is indicative of the future of writing--and I do actually hope it will be.  What is important here is this, however: this is a great book, and you should buy it.  I won't be so audacious as to predict this will be in schoolrooms in the near future, taught alongside, say, [[ASIN:0451521234 1984]], but it tells a cautionary tale that is worthy of teaching our young.  As long as we have politicians who believe it is right to forgo pleasing the 47 % who disagree with them...that thosewho are \\"unlike\\" them are somehow worth less than those who are \\"like\\" them, we will run the risk of a future not unlike this one.  We have already give society the means of accomplishing global extermination--we run the risk every single day of encountering the next person (or oligarchy) who could put it into being.the fact that much of society just mills about oblivious, like those who brought lawn chairs to view the opening battles of the Civil War.  Or, more properly, perhaps: they never even realized that a battle was taking place, and cared little even if they did.  They only want to go about their business and be left alone.

0547884591|4.0|This is the first time I've read a non-fiction book and really gotten lost reading it. When Tim says it is like a &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; it really is. I'm sure a lot of other reviews will focus on the content and the message which I think are great *IF* you make an effort to follow through. I'd like to draw attention to how well produced this whole book really is. The way it is written obviously had a lot of thought behind it and it really captures your attention. Even if you don't want to cook, don't like Tim, don't like the message of the book by studying the way this book has been put together I think you can learn a lot. For example, I can barely focus my attention on one thing for more than 5 minutes and this book has enough side-bars, pictures, and asides that it keeps me focused in the book.
0547884591|5.0|If you have read the two previous books from Tim, you'll know what to expect. Epic Results, This book is huge and will improve your life. Better than free real estate!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|You don't mind waiting for tokens. The game moves well and keeps you coming back. The puzzle pieces presents a challenge which keeps you interested.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was moved to buy the book series after seeing the movie. I was moved way beyond what I ever imagined. Reading what I had just watched moved me even more. A&#34;real&#34; sci-fI writer might have done the polical, sociological and technology aspects better - but they would not have gotten the emotions right. I love this book series and would recommend it to anyone from teen and above.  Be forewarned - the story is brutal at times - this is NOT a children's book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this game is the most addicting game EVER it is so fun<br />I play it all the time. it never gets boring I love it
B0064W6728|4.0|After the horribly boring and shameless sales stunt that was The Great Fables Crossover, Willingham reminds us why we hold this book to such high standards in the first place. Greatstory, great set up to the battle to come.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Very creative story and woven together beautifully. It is very much like a documentary- no main characters. This is also a slight draw back because some of the side stories are really good and it leaves you wanting more detail. The book is not suspenseful in the least. If you're looking for the scary moments of characters escaping zombies in the knick of time then this isn't gonna be the book for you. It is an enjoyable read however but definitely not the best zombie book out there
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Still reading but am always interested in this topic and have read many such books.  Written by someone in science only makes it more believable.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|I guess I was thinking that this would be as good as his last album.  I was wrong.  It has a few really great songs, but the overall feel is not as fun.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|i recommend this movie to every one who loves hayao myazaki!!!<br />wonderfull that is great for the whole family to enjoy!
B0063GORYU|1.0|Spider review placed in error by unauthorized person who seems to believe that I want everyone to know about a silly game that I have never played.
0316228532|2.0|I was looking for a book with characters about which I could care, not a book filled with cardboard cutouts. I was looking for a plot with risk and daring and challenge, didn't happen. Even an arresting setting would have helped, but Pagford is as dull as everything else about this novel. Unfortunately, I could never read more than two pages without falling asleep. Perhaps this book appeals to readers in Great Brittan, but I don't think it will appeal to most of us in the Colonies. The only thing to be said in favor of this book is that the grammar and spelling are correct. That fact is the single quality that prevented me from giving this book only one star.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|As other reviewers have put it, UltraViolet is a DRM monstrosity.  This movie is amazing, I would love to have the BluRay and an iTunes digital copy, but alas, I will be purchasing from iTunes because UltraViolet is an awful, awful, awful burden.
B003UESJFG|5.0|Megamind is awesome!! Will Ferrell and Brad Pitt do an amazing job! I personally love Megamind's interesting character. He is somewhat the nemesis to what we know as Superman. Superman can be compared to this MetroMan in this movie. The movie starts out with Megamind being mistreated by everyone else and it leading him to become the bad guy. He eventually \\"wins\\" as the bad guy, but then has to become the good guy. It is a very fun movie, full of creative jokes and humor. I recomend this for everyone!! I am a 24 year old father, and it is ranked in my top 10 favorite movies.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Big Doctor Who and fantasy fan, I'd highly recommend it! Not all that great for children though, my son says it's &#34;a little scary.&#34;
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I read the reviews on this app and decided to give it a try. This app has great effects. Everything you need for quick editing.
B009KYXEY6|3.0|This Deluxe CD dose not have the 3 bonus cuts on it according to other reviewers. I bought my Born To Die CD at Target and it did contain 2 extra tracks, \\"Without You\\" and \\"Lolita\\" so they were already recorded the other song is floating in cyber space. Then I also bought Paradise at Target with 2 remixes of \\"Blue Velvet\\". The first mix, Lana only said the words \\"She wore blue velvet\\" a few times. The second mix is totally instrumental. I Think that the record company wanted to boost sales. Lana Del Rey was suposed to be the next Adele. Sales are not what they expected. I don't think that Lana had any say in this and she does want to increase her fan base. I just want to end this with I loved the Born to Die CD.Don't buy from these sellers because you will end up disappointed. They don't have extra tracks. Maybe the record company will make good and issue the real Deluxe Paradise CD.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|loved the music and the movie was different don't get me wrong i am not a big musical fan but the actors and the quality made up for the goofy musical the music was nice just not in to musicals
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Watch it for the cameo appearances in HD with the volume up loud... and microwave 2 bags of popcorn.  I forgot the plot before the movie even started... but that is not why you watch this movie.
B00943SQCI|4.0|Since I am a Depp fan i wanted to see this movie not in to soap operas then or now but the vampire twist on this soap opera made the difference .great humor and scenes
B008TRUDAS|1.0|I was introduced to this book because I am a huge fan of The Avett Brothers. I thought the dedication to the band was sweet and was intrigued by the use of lyrics as an opener. But, I was immediately put off by the instant love between Lake and Will, and was wanting to stop reading all together at the poetry reading. It was the little plot twist of ethics that kept me reading. I laughed at times, I felt sad at times, and I rolled my eyes a lot. I read this book rather quickly and I do feel that Mrs. Hoover wrote it rather quickly. I felt that it was very rushed at times and that Lake was too willing to quickly forgive. The struggle to get into this book was diappointing because the same words that insprired Mrs. Hoover and her characters are the same words that inspire me. The use of lyrics was sweet, but at times I did not feel that they applied to the sitation. I was really hoping for some concert action; I know that Will eventually takes Lake to see those North Carolina beauties, but it was hardly mentioned. I have to say if it were not for the Avett Brothers I would not have read this book, and I certainly would not have finished the second one which was far more rushed than the first. By the time I finished the series I was completely put off and almost ruined for the Avett Brothers. I hope that Scott and Seth never read this series and find their beautiful words watered down for a crummy teen novel.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Graphics are pretty good as like any other disney movie but the story plot and the drama part is not up to the mark.<br />the best measure is: my 6 years old didn't shown much interest while watching this movie. we both watched many other disney movies to gether i know her interest on the disney movies. eg. Secret of the wings (she watched it 6 times) and she didnt even asked to watch this movie second time...that shows how miserably disney failed in presenting this movie.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I loved Kristen Stewart as Snow White.  Charlize Theron is also a seriously great witch.  Chris Hemsworth is also great
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read this book in just a few days, missing many hours of sleep.  Rich and complex characters.  Intense. Worth your time.
B003H6Z0TU|5.0|I have seen this performance in Salzburg in 1964 and has been waiting for a recording of it ever since. Now it is on DVD. Marvellous. Walter Berry is the best Papageno I have ever seen, and I have seen several.
0547884591|5.0|I appreciate this book for the way it teaches, but also teaches how to learn. That opens it up to learn ANYTHING now, using Tim's proven formula.<br /><br />I have yet to try out many of the recipes, but will, soon.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lots of pictures to illustrate his points<br />Detailed step-by-step on how to do everything<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wish it would of come out a few years ago. Could of saved me some time. ;)<br /><br />Mike
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a GREAT CD.  I listen to it over and over again and have several favorite songs on it as well.
B0093LFGMO|3.0|I waited patiently for the CD to become available here in America.  I waited patiently, then not so patiently and finally quite impatiently.  Maybe it was the wait that caused me to build it up too much in my mind and anticipation.  When I heard the first single release 'Candy' I thought it wasn't awful and hoped the rest would be better.  Then I heard the first song & waited, 2nd song & waited, 3rd song...,,,...waited.  Well, I think you can see the pattern.  I kept hoping to hear the one or two songs that I would just LOVE that would make the $$$ & waiting worth it.  For me it never quite happened.  A couple if the songs are hum-a-long worthy but that's about it.  'Hey Wow Yeah Yeah' brought back the ghost of my father saying 'If you don't turn that down you'll go deaf!'....I think deaf may have been a better choice over this song.  Then there's 'S$#*t On The Radio' which left me with two thoughts. First,' are you sure you didn't mean S&#!t on this new CD' & second 'ooooh listen, he found away to say the 'S' word repeatedly in one song, talent that is!  Very Clever lad!  For me the two relatively bright spots are 'Hunting You' & 'Eight Letters'.  Perhaps this album was influenced by his recent work with Take That, it did sound a little boyband pop -ish around the edges of some songs. Perhaps the music seems so different because we aren't listening to the songs of a twenty-something young man working through usual young adult angst.  These are the songs of a thirty, almost forty-something man with some life experience under his belt.  A newlywed husband and new father.  He's still, as we all are, the sum total of his life experiences so naturally the music is going to reflect the changes in the man.  Unfortunately, it reminded me of those 'where are they now' shows that spotlight someone who was a successful child actor but didn't make the transition to adult work.  If you haven't been a big Robbie fan or if you can put aside the rest of his work and listen to thiswithout expectations you may enjoy it.  If, on the other hand you are hoping for cd that is the 'next step' in Robbie's music, a step that builds upon the foundation created through a long career with some stellar moments, if your are expecting more mature work with a smooth transition this cd may be a disappointment.  Approach it with out preconceived ideas or great expectations and you might find a few hum-along songs to enjoy.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Bought in memorial of the death of Ms. Whitney Houston. Loved this movie since the first time I saw it in the movie theater.
1401322786|5.0|I ordered this book for my mom who wants it for Christmas. I'm living in a dorm and will be gone next week for break, and I ordered it a few days ago. I was worried it might not be delivered until after I vacated the dorm, but it came in just two days, brand new, shrink wrapped and everything. Great service, thankyou.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|My husband was so excited when I got this for him. It arrived shortly, and he was ready to watch it that night.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Nothing like the show and still love it . The differences between the 2 keeps me excited and wanting more .. wish daryl was in the comic
0547884591|5.0|Got this book about a week ago and love it so far.  It's not a cover to cover read and is really about mastering learning.  Have tried four receipts, non of which I followed the exactly (usually missing a spice or something), and yet they all turned out great!  That's what I need from a cook book.<br /><br />Why did I get this book?  Well as the header says, I'm a full-time single Dad and was tiered of eating out of the frozen food section.  I have been making the dishes with my daughters and picking up some great tid bits.  Like cracking your eggs on a flat surface.  I have been eating eggs, well for my whole life and never knew the secret of not getting shells in the pan.  I learned that on my first receipts and now so does my six year old. She now has a life time of shell less cooking ahead of her.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|this my little pomegranate game is fun. you have to buy stuff to really get. to play and I'm not a real big fan of that but it was a free game so what can you do.
0547884591|5.0|OK, I already like to cook, and am not bad.  So my purchase was less about that (although more skill is always good), and more about Ferriss' approach to hacking a skill.  So, loved the first part -- the part Ferriss says you can skip.  My favorite part!<br />Goes to show you can put tendencies to obsessiveness to good use!  :-)<br />Buy and enjoy, but it will take a good while to digest it -- and the recipes!<br />By the way, I lost over 30 pounds from Ferriss' 4-hour Body, and run my business more efficiently from 4HWW, so I like Tim's stuff.
B00AAOGQUY|5.0|One of the best show! Best Couple in TV by far... Awesome Cast and story lines. Hopefully Fillion & Katic get some recognition this season.
0385344333|5.0|Jack want to get somewhere. Jack meets the bad guys. Jack kills the bad guys. End of story. The first part of the book which takes place inside a car that Jack has hitched a ride in is great fun. After reading all of this series you start thinking like Jack and it makes the ride more enjoyable. I love this series, but seriously - Tom Cruise? I hope Lee Child got a huge fortune for the rights.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I really enjoyed this first book of the new series. So exciting that it's very hard to put down...I usually just keep reading! The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is because I don't find the main characters quite as endearing as those in the Percy Jackson series. Still...a great new series.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|A wonderfully restored version of one of the best and most beautiful films ever. No computer enhancement here just spectacular photography and breath taking performances. The best film ever. They don't make them like this any more.
0812550706|5.0|Great book. Read it first on my Kindle, it was so good, I immediately ordered the hard copy just to keep it on my &#34;favorite books&#34; shelf. I'm not usually a huge sci-fi fan or even more so- I'm not a fan of books with &#34;sad childhoods&#34;- I'm too big of a softie for some books. I'm so glad I didn't let that stop me with this book. I can't think of a book with a more AMAZING ending then this book. You know a book is good, when weeks later, you're still thinking about it and pondering new thoughts that have come to you from reading the book. A true classic.
0375507256|4.0|Though I liked every novella in this book the whole thing did not hold together for me. Questions and more questions arose while reading. Unfortunately none very important and could only be answered by the author who might not know the answers.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great show lots of action good comedy factors with Chuck Norris and Armold s. . Good plot with the special effects also.
0544045203|5.0|Like I said, I loved this book and have shared it with friends. I'm not a book reviewer just a reader.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I refused to get caught up with the hype of this trilogy....Then after the first book I was hooked.  Who wouldn't want an amazingly handsome, rich man obsessing over you and meeting your every need!!!
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|If you are looking for 90 minutes of just entertainment, not measuring plausibility nor believability than by all means watch this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i began reading this book because of all the talk about it.  Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down!!! AND the ending left me wanting to know more!!!  I downloaded book 2 at midnite, just to read the first chapter!  I couldn't sleep not knowing more!  Great book.
030758836X|1.0|Book should be called 'Gone Money Gone Time.' Because after purchasing the book and reading it, all you want to do is hit your head with it wishing you could go back in time and purchase a book actually worth reading. Unoriginal, cliched-ridden, flat static characters and scene upon unbelievable scene. One of the worst novels I've read this year.<br /><br />Between Twilight, 50 Shades of Grey and this book, I fear the death of literature is upon us.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait to see what else EL James can come up with.  I read all 3 books in two-weeks! I couldn't put it down.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Night Visions is a good album to mix with other music on an MP3 player but it's too light to make a steady diet of it. The lyrics are a bit too melodramatic. For instance, &#34;Before I'd bring you down, I'd bleed out, bleed out for you,&#34; are words straight out of the mouth of someone in high school. But, if you enjoy Top 40 music, you'll like this album.
B002N57KG2|5.0|I just love Burt Reynolds old movies.Burt the legend still alive old now but he made some dem good and funny movies.
B009JCL58G|5.0|I've had it on repeat for the last two days -- and between seeing the movie twice, and hearing the music some dozens of time, I find myself back in my own studio composing for the first time in many moons.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|I went to the multiplex with no expectations...having been generally disappointed with Hollywood offerings this year.  I was very pleasantly surprised how outstanding this film is.<br /><br />It is among the most spectacular computer generated animations ever created...every time the multi-colored tooth fairy shows up on the screen (or her baby fairies) I smiled.  And that is the point of this movie..it makes you smile. \\"Wings up, Ladies!\\" (Yes, this is one of those movies that the BIG SCREEN and HIGH DEFINITION enhance enjoyment).  I believe that the astonishing look of the film has something to do with Guillermo del Toro, executive producer - because he is the man responsible for \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", the film that changed the rules on Computer Animation in movies and made an indelible impression on world wide audiences.<br /><br />A perfect movie for children - with no annoying bathroom humor - a (religious?) battle between good and evil that is not too dark. No one gets killed or wounded because the matter in controversy is the quality of dreams.  My favorite character is Santa Claus - with gang tattoos of \\"naughty\\" on one arm and \\"nice\\" on the other. Instead of the usual stereotype, he turns out to be Russian or Ukrainian.  We know this from his accent and expressions (When upset, he will say something like \\"Shostakovich\\"). And...part of the fun is that Santa uses Abominable Snowmen to make the toys rather than the elves who don't do much work at all. The purpose of the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Santa Claus is to bring hope, cheer, and wonder to children.  Enter  - - - Jack Frost --- who has not taken sides yet. Like so many of us, he is seeking the answer to why he is here on earth... his spiritual journey is the core of the film and his quest will determine the childrens' fate.<br /><br />The characters are adorable, perhaps even the villain (The Bogeyman) was once himself.  The reason he has decided to change happy dreams to frightening ones derives from his loneliness.  He believes dark dreams is a way to achieve recognition....alas, an unhappy characteristic that is a dangerous one in our times.  Our heroes, or shall I say superheroes, won't allow that since their mission as GUARDIANS is to protect the children always.<br /><br />Hey, let's get a real family movie for the kids..not \\"Bad Santa.\\"  This is a wonderful choice. Friendly warning:  The beginning of the movie is very important so don't miss the first few minutes.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|love having the weather at my fingertips.  i also like being able to have multiple cities in my app to keep an eye on

Love the \\"homework\\" assignments...already made the Osso \\"Buko\\", the different types of scrambled eggs, and the Thai coconut mashed cauliflower(tonight) AND memorized 100 words!!  Suzie, seed, sun, Sam....LOVE IT!!  Tim's paths are very enjoyable - making the destinations all the more worthwhile to get there.  Can't wait to keep going and see how else I can improve myself on many different levels.  Because we all know...there's ALWAYS room for improvement!<br />Great job, Tim!  Keep it up!

B005D9MUWY|4.0|For the most part, this is an excellent keyboard, far better than the stock Gingerbread keyboard. I also prefer this to Swype. There are, however, a couple of glitches I've encountered with SwiftKey. On occasion, if I'm typing something and a text happens to come in, the keyboard will turn it into a string of repetitions and insert it into whatever I was typing. For example, if I'm typing \\"review\\" and got as far as \\"revi\\" and a text comes in while I'm typing, it will turn it into \\"revirevirevi\\" and insert it into whatever I was typing. It will also add it into the dictionary of learned words. The dictionary also sometimes gets confused in terms of capitalization with learned words, and can be very stubborn in that sense. \\"Hmm\\" at the start of a new line with autocapitalization on will be stored in the dictionary, and every subsequent time you type \\"hmm\\" it will automatically become \\"Hmm\\" with a capital H. This is a minor inconvenience. There are also times where it makes nonsensical corrections to things that are exactly the way you want it. Everytime I try to type \\"out\\" the keyboard automatically turns it into \\"put\\" for some reason, and this is only one example out of many. Otherwise, I am very pleased with how it learns from you and gets proficient at predicting your next word with scary accuracy. If the developers fix these little issues and add in an option for a user-defined dictionary, like the stock Android keyboard has, I will edit my rating to 5 stars. Regardless, this is still easily my favorite keyboard to use.
030758836X|4.0|I bought this book because it was on the best sellers list and I can see why.  The follow through of the auther was great throughout the book you just keep having to read!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Enjoyable and worth owning.  Robert Downey Jr. definitely stole the show with some great lines.  Looking forward to the sequel.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|My son began watching this series just this year and has seen all of season 2 and 3 but only part of season one.  I bought this so he could be all caught up as it quickly became his favorite show.  This shipped quickly, came fully sealed and in store-bought condition.  My kiddo will be very happy to get this!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Never saw this movie before and since the show is on I wanted to watch and see what he was talking about its prety good no lie
B007TNS6JI|5.0|super worth the download and wont waste your time when you wait for it to update hasn't let me down
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The whole series is wonderfully well written, with rich characters and intricate details setting the scenes. I am only sad that there isn't another one to ready to read after this one!
B005ML9YOU|5.0|I love the books, I always have. I have had the audible version before and can read them over and over.
B005EY2XFC|3.0|I ordered the Blu-ray + Digital Copy version of this product, specifically for the digital copy.  What arrived is a Blu-Ray with no way to access a digital copy.  My invoice states \\"Blu-ray + Digital Copy\\" as does every communication from Amazon.  I have opened the clamshell, and there is nothing inside other than the disc.  No code to download a digital copy via iTunes or to have access to an Ultra-violet copy.  Very disappointed in the switch.
B004NEY9EW|5.0|Daniel Craig is an awesome James Bond. There was never a dull moment! I'm glad we own it so we can watch it again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very simple and easy to use version.  I have click and dragged cards forever and this makes it more fun to play the classical game I love!
B005DF2QMC|1.0|THIS WAS A HUGH DISSAPOINTMENT. I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT. NOT EASY TO USE, NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND.  I HAVE NEVER USED IT AGAIN
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Only complaint he has is that he needs to look up too many words, lol.  Have never seen him read so much!
B003MC5N28|3.0|Great book but no real ending to the story. I am so dissapointed because I want to know what happens.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Great movie for whole family!!!!<br />Better than the original , Chan put it in a different<br />view for all.<br /><br />Mary Abbott
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I saw this movie just this year and was disappointed with it after so much love and hype about it.  The acting was not that great, and the movie overall was not that great.  It wasn't terrible but was expecting more.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written, overrated and a sad excuse for getting people reading. Sorry. Read it for my bookclub, too bad I purchased instead of rented from the library.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|I measure a game's worth by how long it takes me to put it away. This one is a keeper.<br /><br />It starts with an excellent tutorial and a couple of easy levels. Then the fun begins. Found the AI to be challenging enough, well paced and good level progression.<br /><br />Most definitely recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What a fun and exciting read - I liked the first and third books best, but all a enjoyable. So glad to have read them before seeing the movie
0547884591|4.0|I gave Tim's new book four stars because while I immensely enjoyed the unconventional, quickest routes from A to B in cooking as well as learning and surviving on a mad planet, I found myself craving more detail on learning hacks for improving one's life  in general as well as for producing awesome food with minimal effort.<br /><br />Best part about the recipes? He claims only four ingredients per dish for simplicity of execution--bravo--who among us hasn't given up on 20 ingredient dishes that end up costing thrice what the resulting entree might cost in a good restaurant? Other &#34;insider&#34; tips from working chefs are as useful and satisfying as learning to pick locks with an inexpensive toolkit you can keepin your pocket, another life hack in Tim's smorgasbord of a book, under the Wild section on surviving. Teaching us the method of breaking chickens necks before preparing them or catching and killing city pigeons to survive is as disgusting as it is practical and I question their inclusion save for the worth of re-connecting us with how it's been done for 1000s of years and reminding us how removed we are from the coarse but necessary aspects of staying alive.<br /><br />I bought the book hoping to glean some useful nuggets of applied cleverness and high efficiency methodology for both cooking and streamlining my life. There's a lot of this in there, in both very entertaining and usable kind, but you'll have to consign yourself to jumping around a lot, something Tim encourages, as the book is ostensibly organized into relevant sections, but seems to have a lot off odds and ends strewn through. I picked us a &#34;like new&#34; used copy for $18 bucks and was surprised to get 500 pages and almost five pounds of product in my mailbox. Thus, I have a great coffee table book that I'll likely pick up for the short, sweet and to-the-point recipes on a regular basis. Learning to make ice cream in 30 seconds with liquid nitrogen? Great dinner party pyrotechnics. Using a bit of baking soda in the pot to make soft boiled eggs peel easier? Nice to know, but more likely an Internet &#34;how to&#34; than a must have in a hardcover tome purporting to revolutionize one's life.<br /><br />In conclusion, lots of good substance, but also an equal portion of dazzle dazzle, which while making for a fun read leaves me wanting more in hard-to-find insider info and hacks that might make one the prized life of the party as chief magician/chef/mind-reader/Bon vivant. I think this is Tim's aspiration, which he enthusiastically shares with us, but damn Tim...give me more of the &#34;how to make a million while seducing a princess over pomegranate crime brûlée&#34; info. I'd pay extra for that!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|In true Tina Fey fashion, you get to laugh out loud at her stories of success and failures and entertaining interactions thorugh her years at SNL, the movies and now sitcom
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have my cloud player on my computer, my kindle fire, and my cell phone.  I am now officially never without my music!!!! :-)
B003UYUP58|5.0|As an oncology nurse of nearly 20 years I was fascinated at the telling of the amazing progress we've made over the last 75yrs in cancer care. A lay person would also enjoy and appreciate the story
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read every book in the John Corey series and from the onset of this book, John is in rare form. His steady stream of sarcastic humor continues throughout the book. The plot keeps you reading to the point where you hate to put it down. I can't wait for the next book!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|what a different take on inspiration for a book - the Victorian Language of flowers! The story was well written, though sad. It offers insight into the American Foster care system and one girl's struggles through time and life. A great read and good for bookclub discussion, too.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|i didn't necessarily agree with the whole 2 guys and a girl theme...actually pretty disgusting...but you are able to get past that with the drama and action and it turns out to be a really good movie that keeps you guessing.  I watched it twice in one week.  :-)
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I really wish I could get a refund and my time back- that's how much I detested this film. The book was sooooo much better. Why? Because it was better paced and characters actually had development. I liked Jennifer Lawrence as Kat, but only in the looks department, which is funny because I did not like Josh Hutcherson for Peeta looks-wise but he actually pulled off the essence of his character. The actress who played Rue was perfect. In fact, a lot of the actors were what you would expect them to look like in the book. However, the script's dialogue was awful, the cinematography unimpressive, and the film's plot overall lacking. The director did not give these actors a lot to work with and it showed. I did like how they attempted to show what was going on with the Gamemakers behind the scenes, but it got drowned out by the other things going on. I liked how they portrayed the Capitol residents. Their costumes were fantastic, but the others were lackluster and cheap-looking. The truth is if I didn't read this book I would have been at a loss as to what was going on and why I should care. The movie didn't make me care about the characters or any of the tributes while the book made me cry and laugh and reel in horror at the Capitol. I really wanted to turn the movie off after ten minutes, but I sat through the whole thing because I wanted to get my money's worth. I still don't feel like I got my money's worth. In the future I will stick to the books instead unless the author singlehandedly directs and produces the film.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|He is one of the best violinists and artist that I have seen, I bought 2 of his albums and this concert. He just got out a new album which is not yet sold in the US. I can't wait to have it in my hands, I hope it is released very soon. It is a shame that his concerts are mostly in Germany and Europe, I wish he could play in the US soon to be able to watch him. He is a master playing crossover music (classic and rock).
B0033H7VI6|5.0|love it!!! its a beast. I thought the handle slabs were a bit too thick till I had to clear some branches and they really made whackin comfortable. I still might throw some g10 or linen micarta on this beast for looks. Sheath is decent quality and could ride on a molle rig. Button snap around the handle feels pretty secure plastic/kydex liner for the blade (may dull over time) but the steel is great. It came fairly sharp from factory but I am OCD about edges and the belly intersection is tuff on a flat stone but I have a diamond stick/fish hook sharpener that gets the hard to reach spots. Blade strops well and after 3 hrs of whackin small branches it still shaves. High value great price
0385528752|4.0|This book had me hooked in the tiny spots where it focussed on the individual and lost me when it expanded to the business/corporation. While the business sections in this book aren't BAD, they're just not for ME. I'd like to see a second book by these guys that focusses on the individual with the same formula of the rider, elephant, and path.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Kinda cheesy.  Too many character puns.  The Rattlesnake/ Chuck Norris joke was pretty lame.  Other than that, the explosions and ass kicking was cool.
B00001QEE6|3.0|I loved this movie as a child so I was so excited to share it with my daughters.  It came with a scratch big enough to stop the DVD from playing for a few scenes.  Not a huge deal but definitely a hassle because you have to stop the movie and scene select a future scene to get it to start playing again.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|Hands-down one of the best shows of all time. I love these people! Definitely worth every dollar spent. Instant Video makes it so easy, and you have it on your laptop whenever you go!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a story about a married couple that, over time, have very different ideas and plans in life. They are both fairly dark and deceptive people. There is a lot to this story. The plot is wild! There are twists and turns. The wife is basically a genius but uses her brains for nothing but deceit and evil. She is one messed up lady. I do recommend this book. It is a wild ride. You never know what's coming next. My response to the ending is \\"WOW...\\". It sure didn't end any way I had expected it to.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|great movie to share with the family, the perfect gift for my self to share with my family and friends
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the book hard to put down. Can't wait to read book two of this triology.  Wonder what happens in book three.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|loved this movie as a child and to see it now its great memories to share with the grandchildren, it was perfect
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Such a great movie. Even though it left a lot of open questions, I'm hoping a possible sequel will answer them! The music and graphics were amazing.
B001JRB16U|5.0|wonderful show to share with my grand children and family and friends it was one of my favorite from my childhood
B003O86FMW|5.0|She talks about what's happening in the book all of the time! Yes it does have its ups and downs but I keep encouraging her to finish the book and reach the end! So far she does enjoy it and for that, I thank you Suzanne Collins.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love The Piano Guys.  Loved every song on this CD.  I bought 10 of them for Christmas presents.<br />Their music is innovative and fun.  They are great guys and I love their concerts, their goals, and their fun personalities.  I wish them huge success.  They deserve it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Perfect book and we started on the series right as the movie came out, and both entwined the story really well! Thanks so much!
0547884591|5.0|Thank you Tim for making another jam packed guide. The book is beautiful, being full of color and truly awesome photographs. I have only read to page 41 but can see that this is going to open a whole new world of self-improvement.
B001609SQA|5.0|Again, a great movie, no complaints! Thanks so much for offering this online to watch! I talk about the Amazon Instant Video to my friends all the time, and having the alien series on here helps back it!
0547884591|5.0|Tim once again takes the common body of knowledge and, in a joyful and funny way, throws it out the window. I may now be able to create a pallatable meal on my own. Nice work.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I played with it for hours, but there's a pipe piece rattling around in the ball, and there's not really a good way to just take the thing apart to fix it, even as handy as I am! What gives! It's fun though, and has friends boggled!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I wore one out (which takes some effort, I assure you) and lost one.  I carry one on my pocket all the time.  The ceramic sharpener is perfect for light touch ups, and hey the thing just works.
B00A12Z264|5.0|I love this new album. It's a little bit of everything. Not a big Christina fan, either, but I still love it.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Love a good period tale this one has a few interesting twists to keep you interested and yet it has a conclusion .
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I bought the PS2 version of this when it first came out, and I heard about enough new features in Golden that I bought a Vita just for this game. I've only gotten slightly past the first dungeon as of this review, but that was enough to see the biggest changes Golden made:<br />-Fusions have been made much, much easier. You can now pick what skills are passed down, instead of having to endlessly reroll important fusions. You can also search your possible fusions for the result persona; handy if you have something in mind but haven't memorized the fusion chart.<br />-Two new social links: Aeon and Jester. I've only seen Aeon so far, but it's a good link that's already made me laugh a few times.<br />-There's a \\"voice\\" feature which allows you to see what actions people have taken on each day of the game. For example, you can see which social links people hung out with the most, what days most people went to the dungeon, and so on. This feature also applies to fusion, so you can see what the most popular personas are at certain points.<br />-You can send out an SOS in the dungeon. People can respond to it to give you an HP and MP boost when you start your next battle, and you can respond to other people's SOSes to do the same for them. I've usually only seen a small boost since it's difficult to get more than one or two people to respond at a time, but every little bit helps. There's also a rescue log that lets you see the custom messages people made for their SOSes(taken from wordlists that include such fan-favorite phrases as \\"Meat Dimension\\" and \\"Bearsona\\").<br />-Some enemies have been tweaked. A big example of this is the boss of the first dungeon, but I won't spoil exactly how they changed it.<br />-Overall difficulty seems slightly harder than the original. There are also a wider range of difficulty levels now, ranging from Very Easy to Very Hard. I've heard that you can customize your own difficulty level on a New Game+ as well.<br />-Shuffle Time has been changed so that you select from any of the cards that are dealt. Certain cards will let you draw again, and there are bonuses if you manage to get every card in the hand.<br />-Skill cards can be gained from shuffle time & by leveling up certain personas, and you can register them and buy as many copies as you want.<br />-You can go out into town on most nights, and eat at Aiya, trade gems for items at the new Shiroku Pub, or hang out with a few social links.<br />-There's a new skip feature accessed by pressing start during dialog; this fast-forwards through scenes even faster than holding triangle does! Just be aware that some scenes from the original have new dialog in them, so keep a sharp eye out for that if you're skipping through them.<br />-Your characters can wear outfits to change their appearance in the dungeon now. You start out with three outfits, and gain more through various methods.<br /><br />So old players of Persona 4 can see what's in it for them. As for newcomers to the series, Persona 4 was already a solid RPG before these changes. It has a great story, an excellent battle system that keeps things fast-paced and tense, and a good balance between dungeon crawling and the rest of the game. It also has great replay value, since there's some bonus content unlocked by playing through a second time, your character's mental stats(Understanding, Diligance, Expression, Knowledge, and Courage) carry over to make it much easier to complete all the social links, and you get the chance to see the other character in social links that give you a choice between two people's stories.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This is up to my grandson...he is the Lego guy...I just hope he likes it. Thanks for asking and Merry Christmas!
B0067EKY7M|5.0|A &#34;little&#34; movie, character driven. Christine Scott-Thomas steals the show as the PR person for the Prime Minister. Both Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt are wonderful as the main characters. I believe the script is excellent and the actors do a wonderful job with it.
B009EANE3M|4.0|I enjoyed the songs they emphasized, like &#34;Six Degrees of Separation&#34; and &#34;Hall of Fame&#34; and songs like those were fantastic and deserved five out of five stars, however most of them were, typically, 4 stars out of five stars. If you enjoy the Script, I would get the album, however if you just want a couple of songs, I would recommend that you listen to the demo tracks and pick out your favorites, because some of the songs are not their best works, but a lot are.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|i would say is a very good movie but the last 2 ones are good to, i love all theree movies the same, im glad christopher nolan directed all 3, my favorite movie trilogy of all time
B000077VR3|5.0|This is such a great movie and I recommend it to all of those who enjoy musicals. Definite recommendation for everyone who appreciate genres like these.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|i love it especially the bonus disc with 3 and a half hours documentary. ridley scott did it again such a masterpiece
B001NYPTO4|4.0|I enjoyed the movie so much that I just had to buy the album. Obi-Wan Kenobi really outdid himself and made a spectacular musical.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|love it love it love it. Sweet romantic story. I like the practicality of the story line. It hints that once we‘re honest with ourselves and others that it is possible to get a real relationship.
1439181780|5.0|This book is GREAT! It gives some much invite that anyone cannot help notice them in their everyday lives. I'm reading through it for a second time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|a great relaxing game to play. I recommend it to anyone who enjoy card games. Try it out and you will like it!
0345803493|5.0|Good book but I preferred Fifty Shades of Grey the best.  But I would still let Christian do whatever he wanted lol
B001EN71CW|5.0|A great series. The only drawback being that it was not continued. But, then, Star Trek was not aired for long. So, perhaps, some enterprising filmmaker will pick this one up and run with it. I can only hope so.
0345803485|5.0|This is by far my favorite out of the 3 books.  I'd love to be Christian's Anastasia anytime he wanted lol
0345803485|5.0|Purchased for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it. She inquired about the series<br /><br />Maybe I'll look into purchasing for her.
0345803507|5.0|Good book but I preferred Fifty Shades of Grey the best.  But I would still let Christian do whatever he wanted lol
B007THA4FI|3.0|&#34;A Casual Vacancy&#34; was too long and convoluted.  I got bored with it.  It was not what I expected from her.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is a great product. I like the added support 4 vibration/rumble feature. Seems to charge faster & keep charge longer than my original controller. Maybe that's because it's still new but can't say 4 sure. Seems to take about 5 seconds or so after I press the PS button to turn on my PS3, but I don't mind that. Still a great product. :)
0547884591|5.0|Amazing book, especially for the price. Tim's books include so much more than what they are at face value. I've read all of his books several times and they have done nothing short of change my life. Can only imagine what he has in store for his 4th!!
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Firefly is forever on my top 10 tv shows of all time.  The characters get into your heart and don't let go.  It was sad that it ended so soon, but at least we got the few episodes that we got.  Josh Whedon may have hit his career peak with this show.
1419705849|5.0|It was funny, realistic, fantastic!! It had a very good story to it.  I own 5 out of the 7 books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got this for the grandkids but was surprised at how much fun I had playing it! Only complaint I have is that the purpose of some of the games is confusing and there needs to be a help page before the game starts._
B004OC07N0|4.0|Found it useful though sometimes too focused on a more marketing or sales track.  I found ideas I can implement in my new position
1609611543|2.0|Would not recommend to anyone unless they absolutely have to eat nothing but gluten free.  Wasted my money on this book.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|The game was fun! I enjoyed playing it until I realized that in order to get beyond the first level and advance you have to pay actual money to get more characters. That was ridiculous.  I can download it for free, but have to pay money to enjoy extra levels? I deleted it the same night I downloaded it.
B00005LOUP|5.0|One of my favorite Jim Carrey performances and definitely a staple holiday-flick for us. The music is great and the way they brought the Who's and Whoville to life is spectacular! Also, Max is even cuter and lovable than in the book. Grinch/Seuss purists may not be the biggest fans because of the improvising they do with the Grinch's origin story but I think it adds depth to the character and to the moral of the story.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Great Movie .Movie was in great condition.Could watch it over and over.Always pleased with all my purchases.Never had any problems
B000FC12SM|4.0|That being said, you cannot walk around using this thing when interacting with your wife / girlfriend, that's just not practical. This book is great for providing a different perspective for evaluating social situations with your significant other as well as other members of the opposite sex.<br /><br />I do not 100% agree with all of the content contained in the chapters but overall I believe the observations and suggestions for dealing with situations are effective and safe to use.<br /><br />This book is written in a light-hearted manner that is easy to read. You will most likely even find yourself chuckling as you relate to much of the content on the pages.<br /><br />I would buy again and will probably read this book again...
B00003CXA2|5.0|Great Movie .Movie was in great condition.This is one of My husbands favorite movies.Always pleased with all my purchases.Never had any problems
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My son, a diehard Star Wars fan, loves this advent calendar. Each day he cannot wait to open up his new Lego surprise. There are many characters that he has always wanted but couldn't get any other way. He is so excited to see what's next in each individual compartment. Instead of useless candy, this is a gift he can actually play with and enjoy!

141694737X|5.0|This book is my 11 month old daughter's favorite.  She loves lifting the flaps.  This book is a go-to when she is upset, as it calms her down instantly.
0547884591|5.0|I really wish I had bought a second copy!  I bought my brother a copy of this book for Christmas and was blown away by how awesome it is.  I plan on buying my own copy soon!  I'm not going to tell you that this is the real mans cookbook, I'd rather you discover this on your own.  You cannot go wrong with this book.<br /><br />Antonio<br /><br />P.S. Great job Tim!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case has been perfect so far.  Perfect fit for the phone.  Easy to put together and easy to use with the phone.  So far so good.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This was a quick easy pack out and all my camera equipment fits and carry on the plane is easy, fits right under the seat where I can keep my eyes on it. Love it for convenience.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I did get a little frustrated with the love story component of the book after a while  but, it was worth reading. I gotta admit, I'm looking forward to the movie as well.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Kept my interest from the first page to the last! This was a kindle e-book purchase and delivery was immediate.
0061992860|5.0|Lofty, yet again, has produced a publication which takes years of experience, loads of skills and a heap of technical information and makes it informative and easy to understand.  Helpful for survivalists of varying experiences, coloured images and well-defined drawings make it easier to understand what is being explained.  If you're looking at getting in to survivalism, or just spend plenty of time in the great outdoors, then add this book to your inventory.  Minty.<br /><br />Another publication from Lofty to consider is the [[ASIN:1602392161 SAS Urban Survival Handbook]]
1574216988|5.0|Zentangles is addicting. Definitely a workout for your brain! Our household loves art, especially doodles, but Zentangles takes doodling a step higher! It's meditative, calming, relaxing, and most of all FUN. Kids and adults alike love it. We had a Zentangles part and invited 6 adults to try it and they loved it as well. Then a month later, we invited 5 children for a Zentangles party. After giving them a brief overview of the various designs and telling the kids we had one hour to work on it, the kids kept working and didn't want to stop! FUN FUN FUN.<br /><br />Highly recommend Zentangle.
B007HO392S|5.0|A great CD. My love for music is &#34;Blown Away&#34; by Carrie's strong singing a great song. Many other good songs also on this CD.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Bones is our favorite show. We started watching it into the third season. Some of the scenes didn't make any sense, so we bought Seasons 1-4 and caught up on the background of the various characters and their relationships between each other. Now everything makes sense!<br /><br />We love all of the characters and how they are so well integrated into the various episodes. Great writing, great acting. Comedy and drama mixed well into each show.<br /><br />I highly recommend all of the Bones seasons.
B009A87X80|5.0|This is a CD that tops my music library. Eva is a song Angel! I'm sure she is pleased by the joy she brings in song to us from her place in Heaven.

B0041KVZ1I|5.0|There is not anything more to say about this classic offering from The Beatles, this is timeless and the music speaks for itself. If this was first released as a new album with all new material tomorrow it would be just as impressive as it was in 69! I have my old NM original UK on vinyl, and I hate to dispel the myth but this 2012 Lp just blows it away. I never heard this with such depth-particularly in the low end, but the highs too, Ringo was probably one of the best percussionists ever and that is so often overlooked-his performances shine here. Paul's bass comes through really well. The presence of the vocals is right there at center stage. And while some have had ? defective pressings?... mine thankfully is flawless and when comparing it to my mfsl copy, again this one gets the duke! The MFSL was eq'd and it's OK but its obvious too. They did use nice vinyl though! Well, this new 2012 one has heavyweight super glossy black vinyl, it is absolutely whisper quiet, and while they say 180 gram it feels like it weights 2 pounds! Again, all around this thing just rocks! It has a warmer sound than the fantastic 2009 CD on my system (yeah, I have a rather high end MC cartridge, but this would sound great on a fisher price phonograph!). We waited a long time, those of us who got nice clean Lp's really got the  GREAT LISTENING EXPERIENCE we were looking for! This is the best sounding version of Abbey Road I ever heard on vinyl.
0142501123|5.0|Kids loved that it was halloween specific and it was well written so we didn't mind reading it over and over (and over and over again).
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I loved this book.  Kept me interested and looking forward to my next reading session.  Highly recommended.  Looking forward to the next book
0142405809|5.0|It's a fun, very well written kids book. My kids had us reading it multiple times a day when we first got it. Definitely worth the purchase.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|Fifty Shades Darker.  Not enough story line.  Sex sex sex.  More sex sex sex.  Not real world, sex sex sex
0547884591|5.0|I simply loved the book. Tim's style is iconoclastic and funny. The descriptions of<br />the recipes are clear with great pictures. Lots of interesting video links as well as<br />lists of preferred tools.The basic choice of what to cook covers everything from kale chips<br />to scallops to roast beef.<br />I particularly liked the sections on knife techniques. You won't be disappointed.<br />Amazon and the designers also did a great job of presentation - it's a beautiful book.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I loved this book and indeed the trilogy.  A good read for everybody, male and female.  The only bad thing is that you want to keep reading and don't get the jobs done!
B002ZG99TK|5.0|This movie keeps you on your seat!  Seen it on tv had to buy it!<br />Will they be able to stop the train?
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I am loving this game so far. The graphics are beautiful and the game itself is action packed, and lots of fun.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|I bought this as a gift and my friend says this great film is enhanced even more by this Blu-ray version.  A masterpiece of the Pearl Harbor attack told without the usual Hollywood embellishments.
0547884591|5.0|Worth it for the breakdown on learning alone- this is the author's true talent. A worthy companion to 4-hr Workweek and to 4-hr Body.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I'll admit I bought this watch as a \\"knock around\\" work watch.  However, I quickly recognized it as \\"too nice\\" for that.  I have several watches from a inexpensive Timex to a solid gold antique Waltham (have not made the leap to a Rolex, yet) and this is the one which gets the most compliments.  I've even had two of my friends buy them as well after seeing mine.<br /><br />  Pretty much what you expect from Seiko: Quality made, nice glass crystal, solid feel (but not too heavy) and a reasonable price.  Mine is the \\"Olive Drab\\" and the military retro look is versatile and fashionable enough for many occasions.<br /><br />  It works best when  worn daily (or at minimum pick it up and shake it) to keep running, especially when new.  It will also lose a few minutes a day yet all of this improves (accuracy and momentum) once it gets \\"broke in.\\"<br /><br />  Buy it for yourself or buy it for a friend.  They come in a variety of colors and Amazon will back this for 2 years if you have warranty concerns.  This is a great wrist watch.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  He, like other Firefly fans, wishes there had been more shows and seasons, but at least he's happy to have the entire season plus special bonus features.  He gives it an A++++ for quality of the discs and the show itself.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|What happens in Vegas should stay in Vegas was given a very good twist in [[ASIN:B009YP9L7U Waking Up Married]] as author Mira Lyn Kelly told us the story of Megan Scott and Connor Reed, police procedural style, perhaps an unintended pun on the long running [[ASIN:B00915G6TE CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - The 13th Season]].<br /><br />Two complete strangers meeting in Las Vegas end up married. The readers might have to suspend their disbelief, but author Mira Lyn Kelly presented it so logically that quite frankly, you are just not given any choice but follow.<br /><br />And that is the genius of the storytelling. Because of the police procedural style, this romantic comedy became real while we were reading it, but once you finish, you say.. Wait a minute!!!<br /><br />I love the book. It's engaging and the author got me hooked from page 1.<br /><br />This book is rated PG 13 due to sex scenes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never knew about this amazing app until my aunt told me about it!! now im more on pinterest than facebook

B00679T1EO|3.0|This blueray import edition plays great in USA blue-ray players, but does NOT contain the Christmas Special episode, which is the only reason I got this version to start with.
B003K16P3M|4.0|This was a well written and interesting book.  I liked the unusual premise and enjoyed the characters.  It was an enjoyable read.
B0007RT9LW|5.0|Have this on VHS, and wore it out, so I was glad to get a DVD version, love all the different cars in the movie.
B00846TTDG|5.0|For this awesome movie I can easily put aside a little stilted- unpolished dialog.  This goes up there with black hawk down as an all time great.
0525952926|2.0|I have read several of Ken Follett's books, and particularly enjoyed the historical perspective and well-researched accounts he gave in World Without End and Pillars. This series, however, seems like a watered-down, pop version of history. Unfortunately, Follett seems to have gotten to that stage in his career where his work no longer needs to be an impactful, moving, and memorable work of literature. Instead, his name will bring enough people to buy the book just based off the nostalgia they feels for his previous, much greater works.<br /><br />The major flaw I saw in this work was the very obvious political agenda Follett pushed. The diversity and attention to minority and progressive issues was forced into each character relationship, and it seemed artificial and tedious rather than natural. Although I appreciate reading about the issues that faced marginalized groups during that period, he overused and exhausted these issues to far beyond the point of historical insight and humanitarian concern. Reading this book felt like taking a series of courses in African American history, civil rights, women's rights, handicapped rights, the history of antisemitism, gay lesbian and bisexual rights, and racial prejudices. When he did mention conservative politics or Christianity, it often was accompanied by negative undertones. Regardless of one's politics, I expected the same standard of accurate presentation of the complicated nature of history, rather than this very simplified, almost childish black-and-white, good-and-evil story.<br /><br />As being born in the Soviet Union myself, my family has personally experienced the treachery and the unexpected humanity from both the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Follett had a great opportunity to present another, hidden side of history, and the story of the men and women caught up in Fascism who fervently believed they were doing good. Instead, it seems every Nazi soldier he depicts is the same stereotypical impulsive sadist who,as if it wasn't enough to make him personally barbaric, was also portrayed as physically disgusting. If history has taught us anything, it is that nothing is ever so clearly black and white, and all aggressors were seen as hero's by some society or another. This book is a colossal failure in giving people a different perspective on the causes of evils that took place in WW2. Instead, Follett has made this book an easy 3-day read with the simplistic dichotomy between good and evil equivalent to that of a children's novel.
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|As it is one of my favorites, I was pleased at how well<br />this \\"Emma\\" was done. I have read and re-read the book<br />and seen all the different versions on film. This one<br />rates right up there with the others.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I am the happiest life form in the whole Milky Way Galaxy right now because I can finally support Ke$ha's very moderate and low-key lifestyle by buying her new CD! Surely, she will give a portion of the sales of Warrior to an orphanage or a conservative-run program for young women to remain virgins until marriage, or something like that. Hip, hip, hooray! If there's a small complaint I got about Ke$ha, it's that she made diehard fans like moi wait basically three years for her sophomore follow-up! How dare you, Ke$ha! People like me--connoisseurs of good music with a refined taste in songs and singers--want Ke$ha to put out more albums, digital tunes and even EPs so that she can single-handedly save music from the evil clutches of those no-talent \\"artists\\" like Led Zeppelin, Muse and Bruce Springsteen.<br /><br />We all love and remember Animal because it delivered instant radio-friendly hits that were also timeless classics that future generations will absolutely refer back to for inspiration and inner strength. Don't believe the lies for a minute about Ke$ha's extremely high-quality and intelligent music (like the lie that her songs are juvenile, feature nothing but annoying sound effects, tempt young girls into being loose women of ill repute, or that she can't sing to save her life!). We all know that Ke$ha possesses the greatest singing voice known to man, easily besting Celine Dion, Aretha Franklin and William Hung--combined! So I won't even waste my time in defending her because she's basically perfect, yo.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Warrior is even better than Animal! Wow, Ke$ha, from what kind of fountain of musical genius did you drink to even outdo yourself on your sophomore effort! Wow! That was even more surprising than Barack Obama's pretense about wanting to avoid the fiscal cliff at the end of the year! Yowza. Warrior features the usual awesomeness you demand from this princess of pervy pop perfection. It comes complete with more autotuning through the roof, phat beats that seem egregious, highly intellectual lyrics about Mick Jagger and her junk, endless repetitions of the same words just to keep the rhythm in a verse, and, naturally, relentless loops of DJ-inspired sound effects that sound more like they were created using a combination of the Nintendo Wii and household PC software! In short, it's the hippest, hottest musak around, yo!<br /><br />For just one example of Ke$ha's returning godliness, take the title track...which...I think is called...Warrior, but I'm not totally sure. Anywho, it features the same lovely Ke$ha voice we all know (and by lovely, I mean nasally and unable to carry a tune properly), spread out over block-rockin' beats that just won't end! D/a/m/n, I'm going to brush my teeth with Jack Daniels tonight to celebrate! Or take the slightly rock-infused ditty called Dirty Love (which is probably a reference to a boy's crotch area). It features the same, tubular oh-oh-ohs over and over again, nonsensical lyrics and, oh yeah, Iggy Pop making a cameo. I wish Ke$sha would adopt me.<br /><br />If you want good music, sprint, don't even run to your local record store or PC terminal to buy or download this album. Ke$ha is counting on you to help her in her unerring quest to save the music world from all those absolutely trivial and talentless acts like Elvis, Metallica, Garth Brooks and Devo.through the roof, phat beats that seem egregious, highly intellectual lyrics about Mick Jagger and her junk, endless repetitions of the same words just to keep the rhythm in a verse, and, naturally, relentless loops of DJ-inspired sound effects that sound more like they were created using a combination of the Nintendo Wii and household PC software!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|the interaction is great. the kids love playing and it keeps them entertained; especially on those long car rides. pure enjoyment.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|But I very much disliked it.  Hero is a manipulative jerk and heroine is TSTL.  I had to stop midway so I could not be quite so annoyed before finishing.  Neither of them have any redeeming qualities and neither does the book.  Don't bother.  Not worth it even free.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|we go camping a lot &amp; this was the 4 or 5 clock I tried. should have been the 1 !  it has always worked.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really enjoyed this game until the freezing/closing started occurring whenever I went to the shop.  Please update or fix...I have a KF.
B00006GA4C|5.0|This Grand Funk is hard driving and powerful. I love it. It is there best album by far. Buy it.
B009439HEY|5.0|Outstanding.  Great sound, great selection of songs, Excellent interpretations of the originals.<br />Many special guest appearences by outstanding performers. Steve Hackett is always amazing
B009WO7NQO|5.0|They did a great job of incorperating things from the movies into this game. from a big star wars fan. My 8 yr old grandson loves playing it.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|If you are not familar with Big Big Train, do not even think twice.  Buy this album!! The first time I played this album I really liked it. After 3 or 4 listens, I can not take it off.  This is such an amazing album from the beginning to the end. Every song on this album is outstanding, and each song will take you on its own journey.<br />In my opinion this is the album of the year!!!!!!!<br />ENJOY!!!!
B009FOBZL0|4.0|I loved Jakob Dylan's solo stuff and the Wallflowers' albums in the 90s. This was a very nice mix of all the best stuff Dylan Jr. has done over his career. There are intimate, warm songs, and darker songs that show more influence from Tom Waits than anyone else. &#34;Misfits and Lovers&#34; is going on all the playlists! The album gets a bit dull toward the end after the genius of the first few songs. Too many long-time bands frontload all their good material and don't weigh the album properly.
B006MGC3VK|3.0|This album is ok. However it is not their best in my opinion. Try to hear some of this over the internet before purchasing.
079074404X|5.0|This is a great old movie that is treasured. This is watched over and over and will be viewed for many years to come.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|If you like Steely Dan and Donald Fagen's other solo albums you will like this album.<br />Nothing special though. No new ground broken here. I  like his other solo projects more, but it is an OK listen.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Despite more recent similar stories and fancier animation, this is still my favorite one. I love animated movies, and every time I watch this one, I notice something new (or maybe I am just easily amused...). Anyway, I think this is one of the classics, and a true family movie.
1742200206|5.0|This Lonesome Planet guide is packed with hot spots, historical facts, and out of the way destinations in New York.  I can't wait to try one of the spas and several of the restaurants.  Great guide and very current.  We're going in January so I'll report back and tell you our favorites.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is so wonderful, and I haven't talked to anyone who didn't think it was the greatest.  I can't wait for the next season.
B000W453KQ|5.0|What can I say...I loved it when it originally came out. I still love this film. If you havent seen it you should.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|After seeing the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34;, I watched &#34;The Conspirator&#34; and It really made me think, and I had never thought about Mary Surratt,
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This apocalyptic film about the end of the world shows the importance of the word of God. How though some may think the Holy Bible is obsolete...just how much it is still relevant today. At least several people know this and one ruthless person tries to capture it for his schemes. How relevant.
B007NCSQFO|1.0|It is possible that Ms. Minaj has some talent, although I am not hearing it personally, but the fact that she chose to make every song on the entire album be rated explicit tells me that she really needs to figure out a way to express herself intelligently and accessibly if she really wants to ever be taken seriously as an artist.  This is unlistenable, and it didn't have to be.
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|Bought it for my boyfriend. It came in excellent time and the quality was great! Very happy boyfriend it was the last Simple Plan CD he needed to complete his collection.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Suspenseful and hard to put down.  Flynn keeps you on the edge of your seat and turning (or flicking) the pages quickly to see what happens!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has been my favorite author from his first novel on. Mitch Rapp is the most complex character in modern literature, and I only wish there was a REAL Mitch Rapp working for the USA. This latest novel continues Flynn's tradition of exciting action, conservative values, and detailed analysis of real-world situations.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is another great story from Mr. Grisham. I did enjoy the unpredicatable twist in the story.  I was a bit confused by the time line of the story.  There a places where it felt unreal, or unbelivable.  But the over all story was great.  The main character left you wondering if you really liked him.
0547884591|5.0|Will make you a bad-ass. It is the best book he's written and I couldn't love cooking more now. I have made tons of foods from this, and it tastes better and it's cheaper than any restraunt
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't think I would like a zombie show, but this one is very cool!  I love the character development. Each episode leaves you wanting to know more!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Fun and challenging game!! I was surprised and happy that there aren't too many ads for being a free app!!!&#34;
B0085S1IQY|5.0|I first picked up this book because of the beautiful covers done by Leo and Diane Dillon - but, was swept away from page one. Nix's writing style is precise and descriptive with a narrator who has this faint old world charm. I have read these books in many reiterations from my childhood to now, and I've seen new things appear and nuances uncovered. I recommend this book to the reader who wants a fantasy book that challenges notions of cliches from world-building to magic weaving. Nix is masterful in his words and characterizations. This book is worth the read and rereads, among the other two that complete this series. Sabriel is dark, adventuresome and beautiful. Read this now!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|TAlk about fantastic faiey tales this was great. I intend to watch it over and over. I wouldnt recommand it for children but it was great for those over thirteen. maybe we can have a Cinderella and her evil stepsisters next.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I hate giving negative book reviews but I am going to do it anyway.  I love J.K Rowling and am a HUGE Harry Potter fan.  I had high hopes for her adult novel but alas was disappointed.  All of the characters seemed miserable and the story just never seemed to go anywhere until the end which was a whole lot of sadness crammed together.  Despite not liking the story itself, I do think she writes extremely well.  Bottom line, if it doesn't have a wizard in it next time, I won't be reading any adult novel from J. K.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This was a great moviekept me right there for ever second of it. I would recommand it highly. I hope there is a sequeal.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author makes beautiful use of the language in telling this story. It is truly sci-fi with a great plot that keeps  you guessing, without becoming overburdened with unnecessary details --and this is accomplished without any loss of intensity or  relevance to a real fan of intelligent, coherent sci-fi. Howey presents characters that are believable and made to come alive in ways worthy of a great novelist in classic literary fiction,such as Dickens (not a claim I would make lightly). It is a compelling, fun read. What more can one ask? I just wish there was more of it, as I was ready to see what the major players would do next. I treated myself to the enhanced version on Kindle Fire HD  and have found this to be the most enjoyable read I have found to date in this format. The story is so well told and the reader does a great job on the audible portion that whether I was just doing some straight reading, reading along with the audible portion or just listening--all were equally enjoyable and I never felt I was losing anything by going with whatever happened to be the most convenient  method for me to use at any given time. A winner all around!
B001EN71CW|5.0|My husband has wanted this for sooooo long...ever since we watched it the first time on DVD's rented from the local library. When he told me it was on sale for $10 off as a &#34;Deal of the Day&#34;, I knew what one of his Christmas presents would be.<br />Product arrived in excellent condition. We'll see how she plays come Christmas day. ;)
B008YJFF2M|5.0|Ok, to be fair, some of the songs on here aren't the best; for instance the nails on the chalkboard aka Alicia Keys and Jack White, but that's not the point is it? No, this is one of those discs that you listen to to remember the movies, the earlier tracks are perfect for that vintage themed cocktail party you always plan to have and the later tracks can readily find a home in just about any playlist. Some of the 80s entries are a little cheesy but then again so were the movies so not much of a surprise.<br /><br />I bought this purely for the nostalgia of the movies, the opportunity to relive the movies in 3 minute soundbites, not because they are necessarily favorite songs. So, if you're a fan, and I'm guessing you are otherwise you wouldn't be on this page, go ahead, the price is right and you'll enjoy the memories that this disc inspires. If you're a casual so-so fan, then skip it, its just not intended for you, and that's ok.
B007M45PMU|4.0|There is something about their songs that just lulls me to sleep or makes a commute from/to work or from/to school easier. It is just plain good music!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great game.  I find myself playing it more than I thought I would.  It has advertising but it is not at all intrusive...after all the app is free.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|So my review is kinda biased because everything that I have listened to over the years from this great artist has been great, and so therefor I love this cd as well. I prefer his previous cd more than this one, but I had to get it since one of the songs will be the one I use for my first dance with my future husband come this summer. I have to say it is all around a great listen and his voice is  always comforting. His lyrics have been a blessing to my life and have helped me through some rough situations. Definitely a good title as well for this cd. &#60;3
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My family loved the movie. Can't wait for the second part to come out. I' ll recomend it for a family movie night.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Her music is able to make me feel ready to write a term paper, and that in itself can be hard. But I also find that I like her music due to its sing-a-bility. (Meaning, I can sing a lot with it) it is definitely in my range. But it is fun, energetic, and a great cd to listen to whether your in your car, at home, or going out! I love her videos as well.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|The tools seem great but it doesn't seem to work with a stylis. I could only get it to work with my finger.<br />I draw much better with a tool. Wasn't much for finger painting.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferris does it again. This time I found my first take away in the very first paragraph, one that is worth the entire price of the book. It is beautiful, captivating and I am thrilled with with the hard back and Kindle version.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|It was a pretty fun game. It made you think about different designs to get to the finish. But on my Kindle Fire, it kept crashing and freezing up.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|If you liked the songs from the movie and the actors rendition of each song, then this CD is an easy buy.<br /><br />Buy it, play it and enjoy it.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|I really, really like this app. Now, all of a sudden, it's giving me a nag screen saying I HAVE to be logged in to the appstore in order to use the app, every time I launch it. What kind of crap is that? I bought the full version. What right does Amazon have to require I be logged in??? It's a bunch of bullcrap.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|Rock of Ages had a limited release where I live. I think it was on the cinemas no more then 2 weekends, and I decided to go and see it mainly based on the soundtrack and also I tend to watch the movies Paul Giamatti is involved, I like his acting.<br /><br />Let's start by saying this is a musical, and you can expect a lot of humor and a story that just barely makes sense. The movie is just truly simple in many ways.The movie tells a different story from the broadway musical, with a more lightened and positive ending, by telling a pretty straight forward love story. Not much of a surprise there.<br /><br />But at the same time, it is truly enjoyable. The actors do an amazing job singing all those classic songs and Tom Cruise particularly delivers a very strong performance as a rock n roll legend.<br /><br />I bought the DVD version, and there is not much to say about it. I give it 4 stars as I think the DVD was very much bare bones, there is almost no extras, and even the interviews are missing Tom Cruise.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|A bit more fast paced then the show and the show explains more but otherwise its good and amazing comic!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game because it forces you to use your brain. not enough of that going on anymore. will end up downloading all of them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This a very fun very addictive game. I love playing this game. I am very into puzzles and the graffics are awesome!
0871164566|5.0|I'm inspired by Kimberly Sciaraffa Berlin's versatile wire wrapping book, \\"Build Your Own Wire Pendants.\\"  Many books have rigid designs and instructions; when one follows the instructions the resulting piece will look like the author's design but there's not much room for designing anything else.  But someone with a small amount of experience will be able to launch her own original designs by adding her own creativity to the instructions. In fact I don't think its possible to exactly copy some of the projects.  Ms Berlin even displays a variety of designs at the end of each project's instructions to encourage experimentation (with copper wire, of course).<br /><br />The front and back covers display jewelry made of beads but the book also shows how to design with large stones or beads that are drilled front to back, top to bottom and side to side. Those as well as the instructions for cabochons are not like those you've seen over and over again.  They are wrapped with flair and originality but are securely bound.<br /><br />Ms Berlin's instructions are thorough enough that someone with even a small amount of experience will be able to follow them step by step to successfully construct the pieces.  I don't think this book should be a potential wire wrapper's first how to book but I definitely think it should be added to her library early on so she will be inspired to launch her own designs and not just construct copied designs.<br /><br />The only thing that I think would improve the book is the use of a larger font.<br /><br />I only discovered after reading through the book that Ms Berlin is the teacher that introduced me to wire wrapping.  She was a great teacher and it shows in her book.  Congratulations on your wonderful book, Kim.  [[ASIN:0871164566 Build Your Own Wire Pendants]]
0316023744|3.0|In an era when responsible historians are parsing the most historically significant event of the 20th Century into smaller and smaller bites (&#34;Five Days In London&#34; anyone?), Beevor does a workmanlike job of snapshotting the bigger story. An impressive overview of an almost-impossibly broad topic.
0385535147|5.0|One of Grisham's better legal thriller in quite awhile.<br />John Grisham's The Racketeer is one of his better legal mystery thrillers.  The storyline is simple:  Innocent man goes to prison, Innocent man gets revenge on the legal system.  Although the plot is relatively simple, the storytelling by legal literary legend Grisham on how Malcolm Bannister gets his revenge is exquisitely complex.  This is an intricate legal mystery that requires the reader to pay close attention as there is a lot going on.  Fortunately, this will not be a problem as Mr. Grisham's engrossing writing style will keep the reader involved.<br />The Racketeer centers on the gruesome murder mystery of a Federal Judge.  Disbarred attorney Malcolm Bannister is serving a 10 year Federal prison sentence for supposed RICO (Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act) money laundering that he was innocent of.  While in prison, he discovers who killed the Federal judge.  Bargaining this explosive information for early sentence commutation, A fearful Bannister requests and enters the Witness Protection Program and the story takes off in earnest.  I hesitate to say more as I do not want to give away any spoilers.  Needless to say, not all appears to be what it is in this well crafted novel as Mr. Grisham takes the reader on a wild legal mystery ride.<br />Character development was absolutely superb.  This in conjunction with an ever-twisting plot will leave the reader breathless.  Again, I caution the reader there is quite a lot going on in this novel so pay attention and do not worry if you get a little confused at time.  Mr. Grisham has a knack of \\"writing\\" to the rescue at just the right moment to keep everything moving smoothly.  I am still a little amazed and dazzled at how much he packed into only 340 pages--Wow!<br />No gratuitous sex, language or violence.  Just good clean writing.  Thank you Mr. Grisham.<br />5 star strong recommend.  This is not just a good solid legal mystery thriller,best of all it's a FUN read.  After his last couple legal thrillers I was beginning to tire of the same old, same old John Grisham.  I missed his earlier blockbuster novels that I could not put down.  Then along comes The Racketeer and boom, I read this in 2 days.  This is the perfect novel for any holiday and that dreadful plane ride to anywhere.  Enjoy!  Now looking forward to the next Grisham legal thriller.
B005VPRDAY|3.0|Very small amount of lego's, I had to purchase another set of lego's just to go with this set. Not enough blocks.... mostly little circle thingys. My daughter will love it though!!!!!
0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef is a new reference for every man/woman hungry to learn and/or with an insatiable curiosity with new things. It gives away simple methodology to master difficult tasks. Besides the cooking tricks/methodology which work brilliantly (i finally managed to make perfect poached eggs every single time), there is much more to it. The curiosity/attention to details that matter will help you to improve any of your existing skills and, why not, add few more. Like any revolutionary approach, ie different than what is accepted as \\"the norm\\", there will be resistance but at the end of the day, this will change how people learn/live. A must BUY/HAVE!!!
0547884591|5.0|FHAB - Ferris At His Best! This book is great fun, beautifully laid out and filled with depth and originality. A great coffee table display gift. So thick with terrific is this work of smart, it doubles as a dumbbell! Hey - strength training works sportsfans - and so does The 4-Hour Chef!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Needed these because I'd lost the ones that came with my Plantronics Voyager HD and they were exactly what I needed..
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Excellent production. I actually felt pain when the horse gets trapped in the barbed wire. I guess we must assume no animals were harmed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is by far one of his best books.  I loved it! It deserves five stars and maybe six..must read
B0058SNI58|5.0|These are adorable on and really comfortable.  I wear a size 7 and ordered a size 7 and it fit's perfectly.  I love Crocs - they feel like you are walking on air, super light.  I have already gotten compliments on them at work.  Price was reasonable too.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love to do puzzles.  This is a great app but not all the puzzles I have ordered are available to me.  The app says I already own the puzzle but it wont download.  Don't know what the deal is.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|havent really downloaded many games for my kindle but thought i would give this one a try, cant put it down!!! Sometimes and and stumped on one of the puzzles but once I set it down I go back to it later it seems easy!
1451695195|1.0|90% about the doctors illness and 10% about his experience.  I found myself forcing myself to read to the end.  I didn't enjoy this book and I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Like many other people, the Lost City confused me. There were so many passageways and caves that it was herd to know where everything was.<br /><br />However, I really enjoyed this game! It kept me interested because there was always something else to do, and if I didn't know what to do, I could always look at the Game Guide in the journal.<br /><br />So, a very long game with too big of a map knocks off one star, but otherwise amazingly fun!!!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This is a great cd really lovely,  I downloaded it the other day and had a stressed day so I listened and all I can say is Only Rod can make a sexy Christmas CD .
B007TBZ63Y|2.0|Anthony horowitz is a better writer for sure. His books have more action in them and they make more sence. Easer to fallow and not rushed. Anthony horowitz is better!
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Not much to say really, if you haven't seen this movie by now you definitely should. Appropriate for pretty much all ages!
B002M89UMW|5.0|my wife had been looking for this movie, found at a great price and the video library is very convienent.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|awesome just &#9733; it its really addicting so be carefully I'm sure you'll love it too I think it disserves more than 3&frac12; &#9733;
B007HACDLK|5.0|Well worth the wait ! Vince, you just get better and better! Couldn't put it down till I knew the finish.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|... and it was a quick, enjoyable read. I like the image Reacher's character portrays. The story could have been a little more layered and complex; it takes place mostly in a small Georgia town and there's a fair amount of plot development that I consider 'jumping the shark'. I was hoping for more of a Robert Ludlum-esque level of plot development and complexity, but it boils down to this: I enjoyed the book and it made me want to read more of the Reacher books.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|While I like the story line and the  main characters, book 2 had too much graphic violence and sexual content. I found myself skipping over many pages to get past stuff i did not want to read and that had little to do with the plot. I have decided that I will not read the other books even though I was fascinated by the plot and the protagonists because I am not interested enough to wade through that kind of junk.
B008NABUU8|3.0|Challenging game that can kill a hour if you can afford a hour of time. Mildly amuesing and frustrating also worth the download if you have the space
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This movie brought back fond memories and Patrick is not hard on the eyes either :) Sorry that he is not around anymore.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|Phil Collins fans won't be disappointed.  It is classic Phil Collins with all the favorites there.  A nice addition to the collection.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham has come up with a nice light fantasy plot line that appeals to all who want to &#34;stick it&#34; to the man, as well as dispensing your own justice on the bad guys.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game. Sucked me in to playing from start to finish. Intriguing puzzles without being frustrating. Story line was well written. Cool graphics with good music. Nice use of the scary things that jump at you. That's one creepy doll. Please make many more of these games.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Did not enjoy ot as much as the forst one. This one was cornier and did not need Bruce or Arnold in it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Absolutely great love seeing old characters get new names and come back to the forefront.  Cant wait to see what happens next at the wall.  What to do with Arya hope the next volume shows soon.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I was impressed with how low the price was for this movie. I had to read the description over and over to come to terms of all the great bonuses that came with it. The movie was new with all the bells and whistles that come with new blu-ray movies. The package arrived very quick for an online order. It was still in original packaging and plastic wrap and plays excellent. Will reccommend this seller to anyone looking to purchase quality merchandise at a bargain rate. [[ASIN:B005LAIHSQ Snow White and the Huntsman (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)]]
B008YI91HS|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a teenager, and it terrified and fascinated me. Now I can share it with my son, and he just loves it.
0547884591|5.0|so i've just started the book, and am about 100 pages in ... i'll update this review when i'm done, but for now i can share some of my highlights and observations so far:<br /><br />1) its amazingly well printed ... special colored sections, big and heavy, beautiful full color ... there is no way amazon made money in selling this at $15 promotional pricing like they did when I pre-ordered it.  stunningly beautiful book - it makes me happy I got it physical vs kindle<br /><br />2) i actually used the random page on how to build a fire and it worked great.  thanks!<br /><br />3) i really enjoyed the section on his approach to learning ... anything ...  language, cooking, etc.  I thought this theoretically grounding into what this book was about (Tim picking the area he had most skill and knowledge with, and applying his learning principals) was excellent, and really interesting.<br /><br />i'm always interested in how things are done, not just prescriptive advice on what to do - so I'm still enjoying the first section.<br /><br />4) in general, I love to cook - not by typical recipes and complex specific advice, but with general themes and tips and inspirations and I love that seeming theme too<br /><br />again, I'm just getting into it, and more to post later - but I love how Tim's mind works, I love the physical look and feel of the book, and I'm really enjoying the parts I've made it through so far.<br /><br />well done, good sir!
B001JYEMOQ|1.0|What a horrible movie! I can believe Matt Damon was in this. There were only a few elements which were tolerable, the rest was pure garbage.
0525953728|5.0|This book really gets into what it means to be a Seal and what it takes to be a Seal. There are no &#34;secrets&#34; in this book and although I do understand the criticism the author received for writing it, it is a gem of a book for all those that love this country and love/respect what is the greatest fighting force on the planet. I enjoyed this almost as much as American Sniper.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is wonderful. I so far love the series and will continue to read books from Slyvia Day!!! I look forward to reading entwined in you
B004HXIZVC|4.0|I really love this app but it doesn't work on kindle fire. It downloads without a problem but it won't let me record anything. It says there is an error, that the configurations weren't compatible with the device but when I changed them and nothing changed. It still won't let me record :(
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game!  Graphics and premise are simple.  I haven't had a single problem with either the game or the app.  This is a definite Yes, must have!
B006IYG5HE|4.0|i being a fan of scandanavian mysteries an jo nesbo was particularly thrilled with this one. the story builds gradually and it was real great seeing how the various plots entertwined.
0547884591|5.0|He has done it again!  Way to go Tim. Only about half way through my book and all my expectations have already been met!
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|The funny movie was well thought out. Another funny movie with some good actors. They are so funny in this movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As a long time fan of John Grisham I think this is either one of or the best of his work.  The ending is a huge surprise.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|This movie makes you wonder if this will actually happen here on earth. The movie was and excellent drama movie.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The book is not a revelation, not a puzzle, but not an easy reading as well.<br />Well organized (or should I say constructed), good language... definitely worth of reading and definitely before watching movie.<br />And there will be something to think about after you finish it.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|LOVE IT AND i WILL NEVER LEAVE IT<br />original AND increadable. Just my style of artistic jazz. Inovative and entertaining.
B007SGM084|4.0|Enjoyed the characters and the story.<br />Although I have read 'sexier' stories than this one!<br />There really is nothing to shocking or over the top.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is an amazing game. Finding clue after clue leading to other clues, is truely  an adventure. I love the anticipation of this game and it got me hooked
0525478817|5.0|I found \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" to be enjoyable to read and could not set it down from the moment I started it. The book teaches a great lesson of looking on the bright side even when things get tough. Although Hazel has cancer and could relapse at any time, she continues to chase her dream of meeting her favorite author in the hopes of getting answers to what happens to the characters. The romance within the novel between Hazel and Augustus is interesting and at times it is easy for the reader to forget that the young couple actually have cancer. This makes it even harder in the end. This book both moves the reader and makes the reader laugh out loud. Hazel is sharp and witty, taking her life as it comes and living for the moment.This book is definitely a must read.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I had my original VHS copy of this movie from when I was a child and introduced my twin daughters to it. They adored the movie but ended up stepping on the tape and destroying it! Every day for a week my kids asked for Aristocats and in a mad scramble I tried to find where I could get a newer version of it that would last us longer. I placed my order and was happy to see it arrive promptly with no damage, the quality is great, and my kids are happy with it too!
0525952926|5.0|had to go back and refresh my mind with the Fall of the Giants...But for me this was as good a read ,One i could not put down
B002MVS18S|4.0|I have all of Saxon's cd's. This one has many catchy tunes Back on the Streets, the anthem, Broken Hero's, Gonna Shout, Raise some Hell and others. This one is a must for every die hard Saxon fan. The sound on this cd is a bit shoddy but I can live with it and sounds good enough. I especially like the cover of the cd, isn't she cute?  Ha Ha, all kidding aside, go ahead and get this, you won't be sorry.
B004LQEYAG|3.0|DECENT MOVIE. i DON'T CARE FOR WESTERNS THAT MUCH, BUT THESE TWO DID PRETTY GOOD IN THEIR ROLES. WORTH A LOOK.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|This book kept me enthralled. The writting and its education fasinated me as did the charaters in the book. Its a modern day classic.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Well where to start?<br />First if you go to the expense and trouble to send an expensive ship to a distant planet then you would definitely make sure that the people on board were professionals not some rag tag team. Any kind of encounter requires following safety protocols because of the obvious reason of being light years away from the nearest hospital. Besides that, before breathing any unknown atmosphere you must first study it's chemical and biological makeup before even attempting to breath it. Yet, what is the first thing they do? Remove their helmets and &#34;test&#34; the air by breathing it in. I guess they forgot about viruses and bacteria that don't make you drop over dead until days or weeks later.<br />I know that this was a &#34;prequel&#34; for the original Alien movie so many years ago (which by the way they did the very same thing but you excused it because they were hired labor, not scientists). In a slight way we got some answers but in a way were left with many more.<br />There also seemed to be a bit of a technology blunder as well, this movie the equipment seemed to be higher tech than in Alien and the cyborg more advanced but just as flawed as in Alien.<br />Finally, I'm not sure what the guy who funded this whole expedition was smoking but it would sure take a lot more than cave drawings for me to part with a trillion dollars. I was expecting more proof that actually pointed to a specific place in space not some general area that would be some billion or more square miles which is a big place to hunt down one small planet. Kind of like looking for a unique grain of sand on all the beaches in the world.<br />I was disappointed to say the least and the blunders should not have been made, it insults the intelligence of the viewer.<br />My recommendation, don't watch it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I liked this book because its nothing like l have ever read before. Pure escapism. The writing and the prose. (Delightful). A book must consume me, if the writing is too slopy or too may adjectives l loose focuss,  Kept me guessing all the way through. I was looking for Christian wherever l went and thought l might see him in any Audi. Bliss.
1449410243|4.0|I read the book in 30 minutes - it's hilarious!  Matthew Inman is great.  Although I feel like the book could have been longer.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Can l have some more please. Ive never been into romances and this by far the best. Ive heard alot of talk about being anti femist and l belive its more about equalism. I want more and am stalking the author on twitter. Could not put it down. I havent found anything like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this one as much as the first<br />Looking forward to Mockingjay<br />The suspense of the ending has me hooked
1936608898|5.0|This book is fantastic. Really fantastic. It explains the science with decent depth, though you should know that if you're looking for very in-depth scientific descriptions, you won't find that here. This book is meant to be a hands-on guide to an intense 30-day elimination diet along the lines of the paleo/ancestral health movement.<br /><br />I was kind of skeptical, but I gave it a try. And I am so glad I did!
B00917IQFY|5.0|\\"Three Chords Good\\", the reunion album by Graham Parker and the Rumour, is not a throwback to the classic Graham Parker & The Rumour albums of the late 1970s thru 1980.  Anyone looking for a redo of that explosiveness will probably be disappointed.  But they shouldn't be.<br /><br />While \\"Three Chords Good\\" is less aggressive than those early GP & Rumour albums, it is arguably still just as good.  They are not trying to sound like they are still in their 20s and early 30s.  The sound captured on \\"Three Chords Good\\" is of a band in their 60s.  That means it's a more reflective and less juiced up sound.  But the songs are still extraordinary and the album rocks as much as it needs to.  The playing of The Rumour is more subtle than on the early GP albums, but still top notch.  These are exceptionally talented musicians and it shows.<br /><br />The Rumour were one of the great backing bands and what a shame that Graham Parker chose to disengage from them after 1980.  While that didn't stop Graham Parker from releasing many great albums in the 3 decades since, it was still a tragic mistake to disassociate from The Rumour.  Since The Rumour were arguably one of the great backing bands ever, what came after from Graham Parker could only compare negatively since no matter how good the playing might have been and no matter how great the songs and strong the albums were, the end result could never be quite as brilliantly realized as would have been the case, both live and on record.  That's perceptive reality, whether it's justified or not.<br /><br />Regardless of what might have or could have been, the bottom line is that \\"Three Chords Good\\" is a classic Graham Parker and The Rumour album.  They could have chosen to package it with the same type of aggressive in-your-face playing and production as on \\"Squeezing Out Sparks\\".  I would not have complained had they done that, but that would have been the easy choice to make.  With \\"Three Chords Good\\", Graham Parker and The Rumour are not afraid to forgo recapturing old glories so as to chart out new ones.
B009AMANBA|4.0|... does not quite live up to the hype.<br /><br />And let's face it... in defense of Steven Spielberg, the hype was nearly impossible to avoid. I felt as though I had already seen the film before I paid for my popcorn. And the bar had been set extremely high.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong... \\"Lincoln\\" is very good. Based on Pulitzer Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, \\"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\", the performances are solid, especially those by Daniel Day-Lewis (another Oscar? You bet!), who manages to breathe believable life into a man previously best depicted in Brady ambrotypes and legend, and Tommy Lee Jones (at least a Best Supporting Actor nomination) as the fiery abolishionist Congressman Thaddeus Stevens. And Tony Kushner is sure to be rewarded for his wonderful screenplay.<br /><br />The story is both timely and compelling: how our iconic and most beloved President managed to \\"convince\\" a hostile House to adopt the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolishing slavery. However, it will be most appreciated by history buff-types (similarly to 2008's \\"Frost/Nixon\\") and less so by the casual moviegoer.<br /><br />During the theatrical matinee showing which I attended, 2 purse-toting teenage girls walked out precisely 1 hr. into the film (perhaps disappointed that the REAL President Lincoln wasn't an axe-wielding vampire hunter and hoping to slip into the latest installment of the \\"Twilight\\" saga a few screens down) and a middle-aged man several rows behind me snoozed loudly. Don't be surprised if your experience is similar. To some, it will be THAT kind of movie.<br /><br />My only real criticism is that the 2 1/2 hour film should have ended at 2 hrs. Everything that occured following the vote was really unneccessary and rushed. We all know the Civil War ends and Lincoln is assasinated. The first 2 hours cover the month of January, 1865 and the lobbying for votes, while February through April are needlessly crammed into the final 30 minutes.<br /><br />That being said, it's a great story and everyone should benefit from seeing it, if for no other reason than to understand the inner workings of 1860's American government and how it is relevent 150 years later. A-into the final 30 minutes.<br /><br />That being said, it's a great story and everyone should benefit from seeing it, if for no other reason than to understand the inner workings of 1860's American government and how it is relevent 150 years later.

0792835700|5.0|Brigadoon DVD came in a timely manner and perfect condition.  The cover was in good shape.  It is on the top of my musicals and I'm glad I didn'thave problems.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with the characters in this series. I am not much of a reader, but I could not put the book down. I think I read all three in 2 weeks. If you plan on reading this prepare for a lack of motivation to do much of anything else. I snuck to read it at work and neglected doing laundry or cooking. I had company over and I sat on the couch to read the last half of the third book the whole time. I feel kinda bad now, but this is a guilty pleasure. I really hope E.L. James writes them from Christian Grey's perspective.
6305558175|5.0|This is my top tear jerked movie.  So happy the DVD came in great shape.  No problems with viewing.  Clarity is clear without skipping or hesitations.  DVD came in a timely manner.  Have enjoyed watching it quite a few times.
B00846REIS|3.0|This story is very similar to the Fifty Shades of Grey series. The characters are way more screwed up. It was a quick read, but does not compare to FSOG.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This is one of the greatest animes ever made. The action, story, etc. Flawless! And this is only part 1 of 4. As the story goes on, and fixed from the strange little anime that was Neon Genesis Evangelion, it becomes one of the most epic tales ever made.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was amazed at how easy it was to learn to navigate this bible, I could keep up with my pastor!  And there are MANY versions to choose from.  Terrific!
B001MYIXAW|5.0|This is the truer story based on the book. Unlike the America film, this is less action filled, and focuses on story and character development. You get a better feeling of the characters and who they are. Eli, is a young looking vampire who hates getting her hands dirty. Osker is a cowardly little boy that learns to be a man thanks to Eli. The bullies are bullies that each have their own personalities. Good quality for an international film. Great movie, but I suggest reading the book.
0547884591|5.0|This book is great. This is something I always wanted. I don't want to memorize random recipes, I want to know how to cook. I want to have assorted ingredients in my house and know what goes together to make a great meal. And this book does just that, and so much more. There is an amazing amount of knowledge in all of Tim's books I always feel like I can sit down for 5 minutes and learn something new.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|It's entertaining enough with lots of good action sequences. However, the predictable and basic story is there just to justify a movie.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I, like everyone else, was a huge fan of Hot Fuss. This album, to me, shows that the Killers produced a great album and then moved on to something else. There are plenty of bands whose songs all sound the same or are all about the same thing. Here you have a variety of soulful music.<br /><br />For anybody criticizing \\"Here With Me\\" or \\"Be Still,\\" either you're not setting yourself in the right mood to appreciate them or you just don't appreciate beautiful ballads, because they are truly amazing.<br /><br />Sure, this album might be an acquired taste, but one you like it, you'll LOVE IT!
B0049OSQ18|2.0|Why do people call this kind of music &#34;rock?&#34; This is country (My idea of country is shake-tunes and British prison songs, so maybe I'm not the best judge of this Nashville-decended stuff). Get it if you like soft rock/country fusion. Good production values, if you do.
B004EKCNMA|3.0|This is a pretty good version of the Christmas Carol.  It sticks pretty close to the original story, and does a few interesting things with it.  But there are a few odd and boring moments in there as well.<br /><br />Also, a big negative was that the sound isn't adjusted right, and I could barely hear the movie, even with my computer's speakers all the way up.  So don't rent it on a computer unless you have external speakers you can plug in.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game.  I love it.  Very addicting.  Cute characters and it keeps you busy and wondering where Scratch is located.
030758836X|5.0|I thought this novel was great.  I loved and loathed the main characters at the same time.  They were intriguing and complex.<br /><br />I read a bunch of 1 star reviews by readers who primarily hated the ending.  I thought the ending was pitch perfect.  It fit in with all that had come before it in the novel.  A more traditional ending that would fit our cultures current need to have everyone feel good about how the characters turned out would have been a huge disappointment.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Great game!! but I suggest you LOWER the prices for gems!  or put them on sale more offten.other than that its awesome!
1849390983|3.0|I ordered the paperback edition and the seller sent me a hardback copy.  I didn't want to go through the hassle and money of  returning the item, but I really wanted the paperback.

B001SAO38Q|5.0|I just love the pictures and updated sound quality from Bluray movies that were transfered from either VHS or older DVD's and so will YOU!!!!
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|As another reviewer mentioned, this film is just different enough from the original Ah-nuld movie and the PKD story to be enjoyable. It really bears only a superficial resemblance to its progenitors.<br /><br />Essentially one long chase scene, I thought the CGI was great, Colin F. did a far better job of being stressed and confused, while Kate B. had a delicious relentless menace. I'm still not sure what Jessica B. did.<br /><br />Pay no mind to the gaping plot-holes. (tunnel through the Earth's core? hardware store respirators and civie clothes in the No-Go zone contaminated by bio-weapons?) This is not a thinking person's film. Lower your expectations, open up the popcorn, kick back and enjoy.

B009L32R5I|3.0|If someone told you they intended to re-make the movie Blade Runner, you'd be like \\"what's the point? You'll never get more powerful performances or cinematography no matter how hard you try\\". That's why I'm so torn on this record. It's such a faithful tribute, that in many cases it is nearly an exact replica of prior work. And please understand I'm coming at this from the standpoint of being a huge Hackett fan (and accordingly that era of Genesis music).<br /><br />There's no doubt, the double-album playlist is a fantastic selection of songs, and Hackett's playing is simply immaculate. The variety of vocalists adds some interesting & unique flavors (Nad Sylvan sounds like a mutant cross between Gabriel, Collins, and Edward G Robinson). Some new intros or parts have been written here and there to freshen things up, and the sound quality is outstanding. This is an exceptionally well engineered record.<br /><br />But in a way, I wish Hackett had re-tumbled the arrangements, instrumentation, and vibe to create his own interpretation of the pieces. A lot of times it sounds like old Genesis with a guest singer. So much of Gabriel's appeal (and early Collins) was his unique vocal inflections and character. About half of this record has the vocalists adding their personality which I love, but the other half feels like an attempt to match everything. It's like trying to re-do Freddy Mercury; overall a futile effort, so might as well do your own take.<br /><br />It was clearly a monumental amount of work to put this together, and for $11 it's a lovely spin down memory lane. I still get chills listening to some of the songs which identify so strongly with a certain period of my life. But ultimately there's just not enough new content to set it apart from the old records. I get the sense that Hackett just wanted to play these songs again, as his original contributions still rank as brilliant. Respectfully, I'd say save it for the live shows and make records that truly \\"re-imagine\\".

0446310786|5.0|It's been a very, very long time since I read To Kill a Mockingbird - maybe since I was in school myself. But teaching it to my students gave me the chance to explore the novel all over again and to remind myself just how masterful it truly is. What almost everyone remembers about the novel is the trial at the heart of it, and that's for good reason; it's still infuriating, disheartening, and effective, even all these years after the book's publication. But there's so much more to the novel; after all, the whole first half of the book is more about life in Maycomb, from the perils of the first day of school to the difficulties of navigating the complex social strata that make up the town (from middle class to the working poor to the white trash, from the whites to the blacks, from the foot-washing Baptists to the more moderate Baptists elsewhere in town). More than that, though, To Kill a Mockingbird immerses you in the perspective of a young girl who is only just beginning to understand the world, and that choice - to let Scout tell the tale, instead of the rapidly maturing Jem or the wise and thoughtful Atticus - is what really makes To Kill a Mockingbird so remarkable. Without Scout's narration, the novel could easily become any other novel about a Southern town, and the trial just another book about racism as perceived by the white folks who were almost entirely unaffected by it. But in letting Scout tell the story, it becomes a way of exploring the complexities of the world through the eyes of someone who understands none of them - and even more importantly, accepts none of them. That dramatic irony between what we know and what Scout knows makes the book even richer to explore, as we begin to realize that so much of what we take for granted flies in the face of the way we raise our children and expect them to live. If that sounds heavy-handed and moralizing, well, that's me, and not the book; in fact, To Kill a Mockingbird soars by telling its story without ever resorting to preaching, hectoring, or belaboring its points. Instead, it simply shows us a young girl who is forced to look at the uglier side of human nature, only to see that there may be more good in people than we think. It's a book that's rich in humanity, life, characterization, language, and so much more, and it's a tragedy that Harper Lee never wrote anything else in her life. But what could compare to such a perfect gem as this?er resorting to preaching, hectoring, or belaboring its points.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I appreciated Follett's treatment of the different characters from each country involved in the First World War. It made the factors each nation weighed before launching into an armed conflict clear, and also showed that there was no &#34;bad guy&#34; or &#34;good guy.&#34;

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|There are books you read for entertainment and books you read for knowledge. This book does a brilliant job of encompassing both.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini details the lives of two Afghani women over a span of 30 years. The book is eye-opening, thought-provoking, and heart-warming. Although the characters and plot are specific to Afghanistan, the themes are applicable worldwide - friendship, love, survival.<br /><br />It has been a couple of years since I read this book and I still think about it and remember it vividly. I remember reading it and staring at it in thought. I reread chapters and felt as though I personally knew the characters by the end. I hated to turn the last page and have it end. I'm hoping Khaled Hosseini has another bestseller in his pocket.

B00028U6B8|5.0|The hippie movement now seems quaint and even foolish. \\"lets take tons of drugs and the wrold will change!\\" lol, however they made some great tunes and this was one of the best of 1969's hippy discs. The songs are great enough and done by great musicians so it doesn't matter that the song 'volunteers' is silly today. (let's have a revolution and put chairman maojr in!)  It's still a good song though. I have everything this band put out and that's alot and this is one of their best releases ever. It's focused musically and features fine songs like: \\"turn my life down\\", 'wooden ships' and others that are just good songs and have nothing to do with trying to overthrow the government and crap. By this time maybe they were realizing the awful truth that they needed to change things and a bunch of wasted people can't change anything!. Still, song wise this doesn't have a bad song on it.  Even out of it's time , it's still a wonderful group of songs and that's the main point. It's not harder psych rock like 'crown of creation' which is heavier and less musical , it's a soaring group of songs. And the extras are good songs too. within six months people were waking up and the ideas of violent overthrow were thankfully left behind in most music , but the good songs live on.

159514188X|4.0|Personally, I couldn't put the book down. I read it all in one seating. In that aspect, Mr. Asher has succeeded because his book completely captured my attention. I know there a lot of mixed reviews about this book, some good, some bad, some very critical, but overall I think people who complain about the main character being unsympathetic miss the point of the story. Which is that not everyone copes with everything the same way. So maybe that trivial rumor someone started in homeroom that one time wasn't that big of a deal to you and you just managed to laugh it off. But maybe some other kid is feeling particularly like shit and that mean joke is what sends them over the edge.<br /><br />I don't think this book pretends that we, the readers, all start to treat each other nicely all the time. It just wants to show that even the smallest of actions can have big repercussions. Should a person who commits suicide leave tapes to forever guilt and shame the people she deems caused her to reach her breaking point? Well, probably not. It's not exactly the mature thing to do. But it's HIGH SCHOOL. If I had only done mature things when I was in high school then I wouldn't have done anything at all.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book. The narrative was different and the plot kept me curious until the very end. I'd recommend it.

0307749584|2.0|Dealing with a health issue and wanting a good story I could listen to, I tried \\"A Wanted Man,\\" written by Lee Child and read by Dick Hall. The result was an unexciting, boring story.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is hitching a ride to Virginia because he liked the sound of a woman's voice and wants to meet her. He's picked up by two men and a woman-they are dressed alike, as if they were members of a band.<br /><br />We learn that someone has been murdered and the killers in the car need Reacher so they can get through road blocks.<br /><br />Dick Hall does the reading. Unfortunately, in the story, Reacher has just had his nose broken so we spend the time listening to a nasally impaired person attempting to determine what is going on. The interpretation of the nasal sound almost sounded as if Reacher had escaped from an institution.<br /><br />In the story there is little suspense.  Much of the action is unimaginative and unexciting. With four characters in the car and the woman attempting to communicate with Reacher through blinking her eyes in Morse code, this goes on for lengthy periods and is monotonous.<br /><br />Finally, the ending was implausible. I'm a fan of Lee Child but was disappointed with this novel.

B00ADYYY50|2.0|Let's be honest.. Wiz has been treading in the waters of mediocrity for over 2 years now. Memories of the young kid from Pitt who basically re-invented an entire sub-genre of hip hop are fading. Wiz and everyone associated with him have abandoned whatever it was that made him so interesting during the \\"Kush & OJ\\" & \\"Cabin Fever\\" era. This \\"O.N.I.F.C.\\" album was his shot at getting back some lost fans. Question is.. does he care? Absolutely not.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to give a detailed review of the music because there ARE NO DETAILS! No creativity, nothing of interest whatsoever. One of the most lazy and repetitive albums I've heard in years, total lack of any originality. Wiz has never been very lyrical, never been much of a thinker or a conceptual song writer, but he never had to be. This is what happens to an artist when they force themselves into the mainstream instead of staying in their respected niches. Curren$y for example, he's the poster child for this style of hip hop. A$AP Rocky has embraced it, ScHoolboy Q, Dom Kennedy, Smoke DZA, etc.. all of these guys have embraced their roles and are seeing success. Wiz took himself way outside of his element, and this is the kind of garbage music he's coming out with. Not saying i'm against rappers trying to branch out and progress, but some just don't have the ability to do it, Wiz falls into that category.<br /><br />Bottom line- he doesn't care. He's going to sell a ton of records, he's going to continue to live the way he wants. Can't criticize someone for doing what they want, but this album sucks. The only 2 songs I really enjoyed were Paperbond & Bluffin. 1.5/5. PS- if you haven't heard the new Pac Div- GMB album that came out last week, I highly recommend it.

B000APR530|5.0|\\"CHAOS & CREATION IN THE BACKYARD\\": For anyone who dismisses the album as anything Other than Excellent, I STRONGLY advise finding the DVD that comes with the special edition CD (maroon slipcase over cover), and watching the film, on how the LP was made!! This is NOT a 24-year old young kid making Pepper, or a 31-year old dude laying down Band on the Run, or a 39-year-old man assembling Tug Of War after a life-changing loss. This is a Deeply-Matured, 62-year old with Full Mastery of his faculties in an excellent studio, and a very sensitive-of-artist producer (Nigel), who has created something which, in years to come, will be more valuable to your ears than MUCH of his other work - and I say this, LOVING his other work; been listening to Paul for almost 49 years. HOW do you choose of his best? Is it 'From Me to You' or 'Motor of Love', or 'Only Love Remains' or 'Daytime Nighttime Suffering' or 'Can't Buy Me Love' or 'Atlantic Ocean' or 'Hey Jude' or even 'Waterspout' or 'Return to Pepperland' or 'Robbers Ball'? WHATEVER YOUR CHOICE, Chaos & Creation stands alone, as a separate recording and listening experience. JL said, \\"I want everyone to get up and SWIM\\". Take a swim in the album, it'll do you good.

The graphics were great and storyline different.  I will warn you, be prepared to uninstall just about everything.  This is a large game!  When you download the sample it's actually the full game, you have to pay to unlock the full version.  I did like having a choice between hidden objects or a tile game.

B003AO1SVS|4.0|This album is a holds true to the unique style of the Black Keys; the percussion has an almost echo-y feel to them, as does the main singer's voice. The guitar lead guitar often has a unique distortion that is recognizable as a facet of the Black Keys. The bass holds a noticeable presence in most of the songs, but is never overpowering or under-whelming. My only issue with this album is that a lot of it is slow-paced, unlike some of their newer work (such as Run Right Back from El Camino) and deals with love and/or relationships for all songs. But this album is a must-have for any Black Keys fan! If you are new to this band, I would give their music a try on Youtube, or start with their other album, El Camino.

While this has been the easiest one to use (no clasp and not a slip in case) I wasn't too thrilled with the quality. Granted I'm not familiar with the Timbuk2 brand too much. The quality of this product doesn't feel sturdy enough for my taste and while it does look good, I think the feel of it in your hands should matter as well.<br /><br />It does do an okay job of standing up like shown in the picture however I think I would prefer the more stable set up of the [[ASIN:B008X9ZCDK Belkin Glam Tab Standing Case for Kindle Fire]].

B008ELUEQC|4.0|\\"Roderick David Stewart\\"--best known as just good ol' Rod 'The Bod' Stewart--has released the very first holiday album of his career, entitled [[ASIN:B008ELUEQC Merry Christmas, Baby]], and it's by far one of the best holiday albums I've heard in years. I suppose that's to be expected when your album producer is the inimitable David Foster, who also plays piano and keyboards on nearly all 13 tracks. The production is spot-on, being laid-back with minimal instrumentation when needed, and full-on big-band and strings on uptempo songs. In the U.S., his first single is a duet with Mary J. Blige, the chillingly gorgeous and beautiful version of \\"We Three Kings (of Orient Are).\\" I have never, ever heard a more beautiful version of this classic carol. In the UK, he's released the opening track, an equally beautiful, lush and rich take on the WWII-era \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\" One of the featured musicians is probably the best session guitarist in the U.S. (and has been for decades), Dean Parks, who is regularly highlighted here, and so is Troy \\"Trombone Shorty\\" Andrews, who receives named credit on nearly every track on which he plays. Another triumph is his \\"duet\\" with the First Lady of Jazz, the late Ella Fitzgerald, on the great ballad \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\\" Using the recording technique first introduced in 1991 by Natalie Cole when she \\"duetted\\" with her late father, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, at the time considered revolutionary, on the critically-acclaimed [[ASIN:B001CVT0GG Unforgettable: With Love]], Stewart's and Fitzgerald's voices blend in such a way that you'd think that they had been singing together for decades.<br /><br />And you can't help but smile and tap your feet in the groove on the title track, \\"Merry Christmas, Baby.\\" It's another duet, with Cee Lo Green, who seems to be everywhere lately. He's just now finishing up his contract in the live rounds of the fall 2012 cycle of the wildly popular hit NBC series \\"The Voice\\" (he'll be replaced by the young and smooth crooner Usher Raymond when the next cycle begins in winter 2013). Stewart and Green sound like they're having a ball, and you can't help but have one, too. It's one of my very favorite tracks on the CD. (Being a huge fan of \\"The Voice,\\" I could just imagine the two of them recording it, because they recorded it together in a Los Angeles studio, where Green is based). \\"Red-Suited Super Man\\" is another uptempo, fun song, written by Stewart and both David Foster and his daughter Amy--a powerhouse of a pop-song composer in today's market.<br /><br />Although I'm also a big fan of Michael Buble, his duet with Rod of \\"Winter Wonderland\\" was no wonderland for me. Stewart is a high tenor and Buble is a baritone, so their ranges don't mix at all, and their attempts to compensate with harmony seem forced. It is, for me, the only failure on the album. His sweet takes on \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,\\" \\"White Christmas\\" (singing the opening verse would have been nice, but yet it is so rarely done!), and \\"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\\" (featuring Dave Koz on tenor saxophone) were all lovely. Again, David Foster's arrangements, especially on strings, rendered these tracks exquisite.<br /><br />And rather than using the iconic Elvis Presley version of \\"Blue Christmas,\\" Foster elects to go further back in time to when it was a straight ballad with lush strings, and it works perfectly. I don't equate \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" as a holiday song, but Stewart delivers it effectively. The last two tracks close out the CD perfectly. \\"Silent Night\\" is tender and beautiful, as the Page Los Angeles Children's Chorus joins in to make it so lovely, and adult background singers then were added to make the track absolutely spectacular. But he saved--probably his personal favorite--for last. Ever the Scotsman, he delivered \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" as a co-arranger with Foster, singing all of the Scottish-to-English verses and arranged for a wee bit of synthesizer-bagpipes for flavor.<br /><br />This album brings to a close, at least for the meantime, Rod's hugely successful experimentation with big bands, strings, and as it is so well known, \\"The Great American Songbook.\\" His catalogue includes [[ASIN:B00006JL4J It Had to Be You... The Great American Songbook]]; [[ASIN:B0000C9ZEX As Time Goes By...The Great American Songbook: Volume II]]; [[ASIN:B0002X94Y8 Stardust...

For those of you who bought this album via retail, between a tag on the outer plastic covering and an insert within the CD, the new owners of this CD can download a total of four tracks of Stewart's songs, including the first track from his new rock album and three classic Rod Stewart tracks of yore.  This is quite a Christmas gift from Stewart to his fans.<br /><br />Why four stars and not five? Well, as of this review, he's a man of 67 and about to turn 68 in January 2013. His voice is beginning to sound as such, especially when he attemps to reach down in his lower register. It's always been gritty, but now it's hoarse and sometimes harsh to the listener. He's best when he reaches for his upper register and falsetto, but not every song affords him that luxury. It's clear that his singing voice, while quite good when the arrangement works for him, is definitely in decline. I couldn't help but think of Frank Sinatra's voice as he aged while listening to this album, although Rod's voice isn't anywhere near Sinatra's level of deterioration right now. And, as I said in the review, \\"Winter Wonderland\\" with Michael Buble was a total bust--and that absolutely floored me. I was SO expecting another great duet, but it was an enormous letdown.<br /><br />If I could, I would give the album, 4-1/2 stars, but I can't, so therefore...<br /><br />CD REVIEW:  **** (out of 5).....BOBBY BOURBEAU.....3 December 2012r-bagpipes for flavor.<br /><br />This album brings to a close, at least for the meantime, Rod's hugely successful experimentation with big bands, strings, and as it is so well known, \\"The Great American Songbook.\\" His catalogue includes [[ASIN:B00006JL4J It Had to Be You...

0385536828|4.0|Ian McEwan's Sweet Tooth is one of those deceiving novels in which, for page after page, nothing much seems to be happening until enough small pieces suddenly fit together to reveal another segment of the puzzle.  And, in the meantime, the main players are, bit by bit, turning into real flesh and blood people whose lives outside the pages of the books are easily imagined.  Serena Frome, who supplies the narrative voice of Sweet Tooth, is one such character.<br /><br />It is 1972 and Serena, bright as she is, knows that even her superior Cambridge education will not guarantee her a spot on a career path she deserves.  The corporate and academic worlds of 1972 Britain are, after all, still very much dominated by men, so her employment options are limited.  But during this Cold War period, British Intelligence sees Cambridge as an important source of new recruits to the service and, when she is \\"tapped on the shoulder\\" by a professor/lover who identifies candidates for MI5, Serena accepts the resulting job offer.<br /><br />She has no idea what to expect next, or even an inkling of how drastically this one decision will impact the rest of her life.  Now, after the passage of almost four decades, she begins her story in the book's opening paragraph this way:<br /><br /> \\"My name is Serena Frome (rhymes with plume) and almost forty years ago I was sent on a secret mission for the British security service.  I didn't return safely.  Within eighteen months of joining I was sacked, having disgraced myself and ruined my lover, though he certainly had a hand in his own undoing.\\"<br /><br />In the last sentences of the first chapter, speaking of her lover, Serena offers another hint of what is to follow:<br /><br /> \\"His case was more complex and sadder than anyone knew.  He would change my life and behave with selfless cruelty as he prepared to set out on a journey with no hope of return.  If I know so little about him even now, it's because I accompanied him only a very small part of the way.\\"<br /><br />Serena Frome, as it turns out, is as finely crafted a fictional character as one could hope to find.  She is certainly not easy to like, but she is easy to understand; she can be frustratingly boring one moment, and be taking stupid chances with her future the next; and she is as likely to let her innate intelligence be neutralized by her equally innate naivet&eacute; as the other way around.  She is, in other words, human.<br /><br />Above all else, however, readers will probably remember Sweet Tooth because of its ending, one likely either to infuriate them or to leave them smiling in admiration - one or the other.  Sweet Tooth is so much more than the sum of its parts that, as I expected from already being a fan of McEwan's previous novels, I find myself in the \\"smiling with admiration\\" camp.part of the way.\\"<br /><br />Serena Frome, as it turns out, is as finely crafted a fictional character as one could hope to find.

B007TK77QE|5.0|J.K. Rowling's &#34;Novel for Adults&#34;<br />As a document on contemporary Britain, this is brilliant. So is the plot, which never lets you down, especially at the end, the weak point of most stories. There are some memorable characters, too.The mix of social consciousness and humour puts it in the category of Dickensian fiction, like the works of David Lodge, for example.

0062502174|5.0|It is a wonderful book telling us about our spiritual quest as opposed to the gratifyication we think we get from material possessions and goals.  Our real goal is the spiritual one, to go where we came from and where we really belong.  Highly recommended for those seekers of the truth which lies beyond our present-day and unnecessary possessions.

1451695187|5.0|Kudos to Dr. Alexander for having the courage to write such a fantastic book based on his experience - - - maybe now the skeptical medical profession should be able to believe one of their own - - - a most enlightening and uplifting book recommended for all those who believe in a &#34;world beyond&#34; ....

B008M87GJK|3.0|Good content from a reliable international source.  Would like to see more video however.  Only a few short headline blurbs available at this time.
1609611543|5.0|This is a very informative book that will make it easy after you learn just how bad wheat is for you to pass it up.  I have been off wheat for 2 weeks and have lost 6 pounds.  My arthritis has improved also.  After reading the book you will understand why people are so fat and unhealthy.
0385535147|5.0|Reading this reminded me of how much I enjoyed reading The Firm. I was thoroughly entertained and hooked for the entire book and loved every surprise and twist that turned up.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the more I play the more I like the game.<br />cant wait to explore all the rooms. still learning the concepts but so far fun.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I was hooked at the start. Strayed's incredibly moving story about her mother is raw and insightful and sets up everything on her journey that follows. By the end, I'd made my own journey as well. A valuable read.
B004LUS390|5.0|The app is a wonderful way to entertain my young daughter.She loves to draw and now is able to anywhere we go.
0307990850|2.0|Just finished ' A wanted man' and was somewhat disappointed. Did Lee Child actually write this or has he gone the Patterson route? If yes, a shame. I refuse to read any more Patterson books since he has reverted to using a stable of writers.<br />This book just read a little flat. I agree with a prior comment that Reacher threatening a 10 year old, would just not happen.<br />Ending still not clear. Actions described regarding FBI and CIA strain credibility. Again, just not up to snuff with prior work. Does this mean I need to cross Lee Child off my must read list going forward?
B008OIQYTG|5.0|I've been a Lee Ritenour fan for twenty plus years so I'm probably biased.  This is a very nice CD and I have totally enjoyed all the cuts.  I have probably played it 15 times end to end driving in my car...
0547884591|5.0|The Four-Hour Work Week changed my life in 2008.  I left a corporate job and spent 3 months in Fiji living with surfers and volunteering.  The Four-Hour Chef is a whole new level of \\"spicing\\" up life and a great follow up to the series.  His breakdown of how to essentially hack languages is brilliant.  Nice work Tim!
0060245867|5.0|This is a timeless book.  The kids want it to be read to them over and over again and they<br />keep focus throughout this short story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It does what it says it does. I have no qualms with this app, other than its even necessary. I wish the Kindle Fire HD battery did what I need it to to begin with. But that aside, this app is every thing you need and even customizable. Good quality and reliable.
0805092447|5.0|Babys like listening to you tell the story while they are looking at the pictures.  The pictures are large and it is an easy book<br />to read to them.  As the children become toddlers, they say the story as the pages turn, but it teaches them colors and they<br />love it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie for mature audiences. Funny, sad, shows later life does not always turn out the way we plan. Wonderful group of personalities, a movie you can watch over and over.
0399226907|3.0|This is a very colorful book however I didn't realize we were getting the mini version of the story.  The words are small but<br />the children still enjoy the book.  I prefer the full size version.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fresh take on the old version. i forgot how much i love playing oregon trail! it is quite addictive. just like old times.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham always has a good twist in his plots. Once you get into the story you don't want to put it down
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love the characters and humor and fun murder mysteries these two solve together. Each season just gets better.  I can't wait to see what else the writers have in store for these characters!
0345803485|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book. It always had you at the edge wondering what would he/she do next. I just ordered the second book, and look forward to reading it just as fast as the first (3 days).
B0086700CM|3.0|Good game to wast a little time waiting. Can be habit forming so watch out. Make sure the Kindle screen is clean.

0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss's The 4-Hour Chef is a wonderful textbook on many specific subjects and yet life in general. The whole time I'm reading, I'm amazed at how his mind works; I hope by partaking of this book that I am soon able to do the same, to break down the complex to the simple. I'm rabid to try his language skills on my particular faves: French and Italian. His mind-set on the basic principles shortening our learning time is the primo gold herein. Also, I think he does \\"obsession\\" well. Something all of us should look for: our own \\"obsession.\\"
B006LSZECO|5.0|good story with many twists and turns. It sucks you in almost immediately so you have to keep turning the page. I wasn't so happy with the ending, though.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|My 5 year old is OBSSESED with Michael Jackson (not as creepy as it sounds).  She loves this movie and watches it all the time.  In fact, this one broke and I had to buy another, lol.  I don't care about the stuff off stage but, on stage he is the KING!!  Definitely need to own this if you consider yourself a true MJ fan.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just a great book a good ending of a trilogy. A story of hurt,struggle,love,joy,romance,survival,rage,madness,caring..the list goes on. Just read it. You'll understand.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|first time i ever seen or played the game. could not figure it out at first but once i did it became likeable
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book is very descriptive i liked the definitions and the origins. This book is a little. to long for me and it was hard to navigate. All in all,this was a very interesting dictionary.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have over a dozen study Bibles in my library and find the ESV Study Bible the best of them.  In addition, the ESV translation is the most readable.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's fun. It's intuitive. My Dad has pretty severe dementia. Sometimes I'll get him to &quot;play along&quot; when I'm playing Flow Free. The bright colors and simple design engage him. It's good for both of us. Thanks!
B00008DDSC|5.0|I love the movie!  It was just as great as I remembered whne I seen it a few years ago!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have found that this Facebook app works best at 3 bars and up so maybe that's the problem with the not loading news feeds? I get update after update @ 3 bars and still get them (albiet slower) at 2 bars and down! I use this app frequently and it does everything I want it to!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I had run through the seasons and Rio sostar wars was a nice change of pace and challenge again. Can't yet get the hang of the bird that shoots and how to get it to shoot the piggies hanging above yet!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|This is just another autobiography written by someone who is obviously NOT a writer. It's difficult to read because the writing is so bad!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have children which range from 6-16 who all enjoy this game! I have even played this game and of course I'm not as good as the kids
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Great book - really enjoying it.<br /><br />But this will be my last Amazon review because I don't care to be held hostage to a specific word limit.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|My own stop shopping for all things news. I saw this on a website of top apps to own, and I'm grateful for it because it has become my most used app over twitter.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|First of all Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is just magnificent as well as his meanacing voice. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was actually pretty sexy and Batman is just a badass plain and simple. I'm a little sad to see the trilogy end...so I would like to thank Mr. Nolan for reviving the Batman series after that Batman and Robin crap. I highly recommend getting this movie, I personally think its a little better than the Avengers(Despite it making 1.5 billion dollars).
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great game of logic just like the original Quell game.  It sure makes one painfully aware of their own flawed line of reasoning. This is better for a larger screen of a Kindle Fire than for an Android Smart phone.<br />I am eagerly awaiting for Quell Memento
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is my favorite kind of episode because it has major firefights, zombie heads exploding, personal vendettas being dealt out and possible new members being added to the crew.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is one of the best games along with the 2 Quell games I have seen in a long time.  It is better for the larger screen of the Kindle Fire that it is for an android smart phone.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is very MIST-like. The puzzle are challenging, but not impossible, the graphics are superb. I would highly recommend this game.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Allot of comic book readers are disappointed.<br />I am not one of them.  Admittingly, I haven't gone back to re-read the original source material.<br />Still a solid first 1/2 of the story arc. Waiting impatiently for part 2.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|loving this game. the details are terrific!  every character is in this game and the mini games are easy enough for my kids to enjoy it with me. Two big thumbs up!
B009CPES4I|5.0|A great, fun, uplifting movie.  How can you not LOVE the actors and their rolls.  A must see for all adult children, showing that the parents might age and look old, but we're still so full of life!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love this show. It keeps me right on the edge of my seat all the way through. The characters are strong and the way the story develops you really feel like this is a post apocalyptic world. Unlike other shows have attempted to, this one really nails it. Not for the faint of heart or young though, this is a TVMA  all the way.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a phenomenal collector-esque edition of this awesome film without the collector's edition price tag. It arrived slightly later than expected due to a miss communication with the deliverer, but other than that it lived up to my expectations in every way.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very good character development.  I had read the reviews so I was aware the ending was a surprise.  It really was a good ending.
0788861948|4.0|The case was a bit rough looking, like it had been stepped on or ran over. The DVD's worked good though, thanks.
B009157BWU|4.0|My 8 year old son wanted to rent this movie.  It was cute and educational.  We enjoyed it.  Good for young school age children.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|As the title states, it is an ultravillet digital download, not an itunes digital download as it has been with prior purchase.  Very disappointed, considering returning the purchase.  Even more disappointing is the fact that it doesnt show up in my Amazon Prime Video Library... WTF!
B008NMT684|5.0|This is great! My 3 year old grangson loves it and he also picked our name.<br />Fun Fun Fun Fun !!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed reading.  I was a little confused by Conner's ideas but thought it was a cute and easy read.  I am
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter loves the movie! My son will even watch this one as it's not so &#34;girlie&#34;. Enjoy as it's worth the purchase.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My 10 year old son LOVES this series.  He finished this book within 24 hours -- which is a world record.  He's now reading it through again -- and he reads passages he finds especially funny aloud to me.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I only had time to view the two trailers introducing the main characters. I have enjoyed other performances by each but have never seen an episode of Homeland. Based on these introductions I will purchase season one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best show on tv without a doubt!  I like how they revolve new characters in at a slow pace and are not afraid to kill off a main character by surprise on occasion.  A gory show, not for kids, but very suspenseful and entertaining.
B009MF56GC|2.0|This review is not meant to be a thrashing of the movie even though I only gave it a two star rating.  I really like these characters a lot and seeing them all back together was still a welcome sight.  My problem with Expendables 2 though is that it felt like something was missing.  The first film is not without its flaws, but it was fun and bad a** and a really entertaining movie.  (I especially liked the director's cut with the addition of the Shinedown song playing over all the carnage at the end.  For me, his movie's biggest problem is that it's all over the place.  Characters drop in without much reason, deliver some over used catch phrases and drop out just as suddenly and some of the top billed additions to the movie are barely in it (I'm looking at you Chuck Norris)  Plus, you can absolutely see most of the plot coming from a mile away.  **spoiler alert*  I knew Billy the Kid's days were numbered about two minutes into the movie.  It just seemed like the creators of the film, Stallone included didn't have their hearts in it this time.  For me the only stand outs in the entire movie were Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid and Jean Claude Van Damme as the new villain \\"Vilain\\" (Get it?).  Everyone else just seemed to phone it in.  It was nice though to see up and coming Scott Adkins play the Villain's side kick.  (I still want that guy to get top billing in a big movie)  Over all-this movie was \\"okay\\" and entertaining enough for a saturday night home viewing, but it really seems like a dud compared to the original.  I'm still hoping we get to see an expendables 3-and also a return to form.  I didn't hate this movie, it just really disappointed me.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw a few Youtube songs that The Piano Guys perform and they blew me away. Their style, sense of humour, complexity of musicianship are all wonderful. I only wish the CD came with a bonus DVD so that we could watch as well as listen! The CD is a permanent fixture in my car on the way to and from work. I recommend them to all my friends and family, More please Piano Guys!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was really an awesome book - very impressed and can't wait for the next one to go down in price so I can get it too - really kept me going :)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|the sharpener put a new edge on my knife that has lasted long and the ceramic bits help to keep the edge with regular maintenance.  the diamond stick is also nice to clean up or sharpen serrations on knives.  took a little to learn how to use at first, but overall it is simple to use.  have yet to replace bits.
B004EWFV9K|4.0|Mankell is one of my favorite Scandinavian authors and one of the most consistent.  He does climb onto the soapbox at times and he is on it a little in this story, but I can forgive him his idiosyncrasies because he writes a very real and moving story in this episode of Kurt Wallander's life.  Already a morose and brooding character, Wallander has now buried his father and is beginning to stare his own mortality in the face at the age of sixty.  Loneliness is beginning to set in and Wallander is visited by a past love that just adds to his despair.  The only positive news is that his first granddaughter, Klara, is born.  Overwhelming life issues including failing memory begin to take its toll on Wallander and when it seems that it can't get any worse, it does.<br /><br />The Troubled Man refers to both our protagonist, Kurt, as he tracks down a potential Swedish spy following the disappearance of his daughters' significant other's parents and the to the newly introduced paternal grandfather of Klara as he runs from something in his past.  The story has legs and gets its basis from the Cold War when Sweden cast its eyes East in fear and West in admiration.  The country was split on whether to join NATO and the general populace had its collective hands full of political intrigue.  Past events are woven into the fabric of this mystery and although the plot is well played out, it takes a back seat to the life and times of our main protagonist in this long series.  The story requires this reviewer to stop here so that other pieces of the stories can be left to the reader to discover.<br /><br />While the story is probably too long, and too deeply troubled and the mystery is not perfect, I will forgive Mankell as a greater and more important character study was in progress requiring his strong writing skills and mental toughness to complete.  If you are a fan of this series, there is no excuse to miss this one.
B0042U2HLY|2.0|Mr. Brooks, had you actually bought this set, you would've realized, I presume, that it's a 9 CD set, not a 10 CD set. Why bother writing a review of something \\"beyond your expertise\\" at all?<br /><br />Mr. Braithwaite, there's nothing wrong with the orchestra, sir. If you check the original vinyl editions, you will find their sound glorious and the performance exquisite. Soundwise, the brass is much clearer and more prominent than the Barenboim/CSO Bruckner set. However, the CD transfer is not so great, and especially lacking in the lower frequencies.<br /><br />Overall, a great Bruckner cycle, if able to find it on vinyl. Wand proves himself to be an accomplished Brucknerian, right up on a par with Furtwaengler, Knappertsbusch and Mravinsky.
006029129X|5.0|I have loved this book for decades, and am now having SO much fun introducing good friends' children to it!  No beeps, buzzes, or batteries are involved, just the marvel of mental creativity and imagination.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is ok but if your into this genre I recommend DragonVale. Pretty much the same thing only a little bit better than this.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Intelligent, breath-takingly incredible, beautifully well-done.  The best MI movie to date, and we're now looking forward to the next one!
B0000714BP|5.0|had been looking for this movie all over the world, found it purchased it and one of my best purchases yet!!
B002VECM72|5.0|I watched this movie with my husband (he's a football coach) and just loved it.  Very good story, characters, and it leaves you with a really good feeling that keeps growing and leading you toward thinking good things instead of you just having been entertained.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I give this one 4 stars because I reserve 5 stars for the really epic, great movies. This movie was very entertaining and even my wife enjoyed it and since she hates movies that's really saying something. Great acting, movie sets and filming. You'll probably like this one.
B000V63AVY|5.0|I love this group and would recommend this cd to every 70's and 80's rock lover. Go and get this cd asap.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is the scariest show out there. What fantastic writing! Every episode leaves you biting your nails and wanting the next episode. The cast of characters are so well portrayed by an truly gifted group of actors. And I guarantee, you will not be disappointed . You just never know what will happen next!
1250004217|5.0|Awesome. One of the best books I have read in a long time. Very educational.  Disappointed when looked Eli played the movie parts.
B008Z9L94O|2.0|First and foremost, this is a five star album.  This is a review of the newly remastered vinyl edition specifically.  As mentioned by others, Zero sounds horrible, incredibly distorted.  The rest of it sounds pretty good, but I'm returning it, for the price I'm not willing to accept this, the entire album should be perfect.  It's a shame, the artwork and packaging are top notch, too bad that quality wasn't applied to what matters most, the sound quality of the music.
B005HSL626|5.0|fun game for my 3 and 5 year old! and it is FREE! better than the sushi chop game. ha
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great. I set it when I lay down to read and it wakes me up gently without a mind jarring noise like a lot of alarms.
B001706I5I|4.0|great quallity my kids loved watching this movie, jim carrey did a great job but i still think the original is better
B007HACDLK|5.0|as always from the first page Flynn hooks you.  A complete enjoyment and ranks right there with his best.  The workings of intelligence and the political world always evident.  Mitch Rapp fun to follow.  Looking forward to his next book.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|its a weird trippy movie but i loved it tho if you want a funny movie id recommend this one
B008F5YDRI|3.0|Amazon's changed their stars, so 3 means &#34;It's okay&#34; which this film was, but I would have given it 2 stars in the old wordless system.<br /><br />This is a fairly run of the mill bait-and-switch romance, of a formula popular when Fred and Ginger were dancing in black in white:  Married man meets woman with love interest and falls in love, previous commitments conveniently fall away, then come back, then, well that would be a spoiler.  To spice it up, the story is set partly in Yemen, where a very wealthy Yemeni sheik wants to build a water project to create an agricultural base for his people, with a side benefit of salmon fishing for him.  The British government is at first an enthusiastic backer, what with 2,000,000 British anglers who vote and who are presumed to also like the idea; and for it's Middle Eastern theme with no explosions or death.  Unfortunately, it's going to take 10,000 salmon hatchlings and the fishermen go up in arms, so the only alternative is farmed salmon.  But will they run?  Will they migrate and establish a fishery?<br /><br />It turns out that, in the real world, farmed salmon do run.  A bit later as they first return to where they escaped or were released, then they miss the anglers who show up earlier to get the native fish, and then they screw up the spawning grounds by trying to lay their own eggs, so there's lots of emerging reasons not to farm salmon as we currently do, but that's not this film.  The point is, the fish DO run, they swim upstream and over the damn (and they swam and they swam right over the dam!).<br /><br />But this is a Western film, with Brits abroad, and it's set in Yemen and all we know about the Middle East is that there's a whole lot of terrorists over there, so that's the way the movie presents the Yemenis.  If they're not just standing around providing local color with their antiquated dress and weather sculpted faces, they're ordering assassinations, and trying to destroy things.  Don't ask why.  Don't consider whether it's our policies that might be causing this animosity, our treatment of the Arab on the street.  That isn't this movie, either.  Worse, the two British characters wander around in casual western wear, no more than one layer, nothing covering their arms or her head, just as if Yemen is a branch of Hyde park.  When she can't sleep, she comes out of  her tent in her pjs, then he comes out in his, and they sit next to each other.  No matter how this might outrage the locals in the real world, or get the Brits killed (it doesn't, the plot won't allow it).<br /><br />The movie is a rather simple romantic adventure, a boy and a girl join a rich sheik in his dream to bring salmon fishing to Yemen.  A few cranky old Arab terrorists and some cynical British politicians get in the way, but in the end &#34;Faith&#34; and Love triumph, and the salmon run.<br /><br />A lot of people thought this was an incredible film.
B0080K3G4O|4.0|It's worth noting that reviews for this book might be artificially low, as many of the purchasers are likely to be pessimists.<br /><br />Kidding aside, the premise is good, and the book is well-written. I found the first few chapters to be much clearer than later chapters, but either way, if you find mindless positive thinking frustrating, this book is a reminder that your frustration is well-justified.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|i love it cuz it was fast delivery and my son wanted this as a movie night to add with the other two he has and plus the movie was in good condition and i was ok with it not having a case cuz the case to me is collecting dust and when you have a disc you can add inthe dvd book sleeve
B00006GFAB|5.0|Scary outside but GREAT music inside-all the hits! I have to type in 10 more words in order to submit this review-which discourages future review submission!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A fun read, filled with bizare characters  gives a peek into life in Scandavavia. I usually have two or three books &#34;going&#34; at the same time to fit the mood I am in,&#34;The Hundred Year......&#34;  filled the bill for the one on the back burner that you read when you are brain dead and need a laugh.  Dave B
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is fantastic for someone who can appreciate those early (and late) high school years. A time of struggle and realization of who we are and who we can be or want to be. Charlie is a beautiful, complex (but at the same time, simple) character who allows the reader to learn and \\"participate\\" with him. He experiences so many different feelings from growing up and finding friends and his place to fit in.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and open heart.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Snow White and the Huntsman, Kristen Stewart is the Saga. Honey. Iced. Tea. in this move i couldn't take my eyes off of her. LOVE IT
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Love it!  I have their 1st CD as well.  Beautiful music for anyone wanting to listen EXCELLENT MUSIC BY A TOP GROUP!
0060392584|5.0|Marilyn Manson is one f***ed up dude.  After reading this book it is no wonder he is the way he is.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Best music I've ever heard!  Listen to it all the time!  I want to buy more of her tapes when my bills are paid for Christmas!
B003NTSBUG|4.0|I hate horror films so I've put off seeing this. But I finally watched it with my daughter and i have to say...it messes with your mind some! I don't know if there is a book for this but I would place a bet that the read would be better because of the ability to delve deeper into the insane others on Shutter Island. Some of those poor people appeared to have really interesting lifes that the movie didn't have time to go into. I don't want to spoil the plot so I won't say why it hurt my heart. But those poor babies....
B009LXEBD4|5.0|You can not beat Greatest Hits music!  Love it!  Would recommend it - Big American Idol Fan and love her!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The acting left much to be desired but the special effects are worth watching this movie for all by itself. The fairy folk are wonderful to watch; I loved them. The wicked stepmom is extremely wicked but facinating to watch. You almost feel sorry for her but that would be wrong, wouldn't it?!<br />Snow white...well...I have never been much of a fan of this actress who plays her. She does an okay job but it feels like a repeat from Twilight..teenage angst and all. But as far as recommending it..yes..watch for the special effects. They are cool.
B007HO392S|5.0|Loved it!  Would recommend it!  Blown Away is ANOTHER GREAT CD FOR AMERICAN IDOL'S COUNTRY MUSIC STAR.  I HAVE A LOT OF HER CD'S AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY.
B009D7CP2M|4.0|Good shape. As expected. Good job, I'm just gonna write words because it has a minimum word requirement. Potato. Vogue.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am in my late 60's and it was written for someone younger I thought.  It was boring in some ways.........sex is sex and I found it more interesting between their sex sessions and really found myself thinking &#34;here we go again..&#34; when they started their sessions. I bought the second book just to find out what happened as it seemed to end like a &#34;cliff hanger&#34;.  I am not reading it much really and probably won't buy the last one.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|While quite graphic, I thought it great to see so many well known action moive actors in the same movie.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was a book that grabbed you from the first page and wouldn't let go until the disappointing ending......which was just \\"too easy\\".  No suspense, and it was as though Flynn got caught up in his own plot lines and couldn't figure out any clever way to end it.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Just downloaded this album and absolutely love it. The songs are deep and meaningful. Takes a couple of listens but this isn't the standard American Idol fare with fluff, It's real music. Phillip must've had a lot of input into song selection. He did a great job.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Wonderful to see the guys in action together. Still hunky and movie was just plain fun to watch! Looking forward to #3.
B009K45Y62|5.0|One of the greatest movie and finale's of all time! I have never been more emotionally moved or satisfied to the ending to one of the createst sags and greatest characters ever in the history of media.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I liked the first season because it somewhat followed the Charlaine Harris Sookie Stackhouse series (well the first book anyway). As I read and watched, I noticed that by the third season/book the two begin to separate from each other. Still great series' (books and television). I highly recommend both!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book. I am an avid reader and this book didn't let me down. Great plot with unexpected twists and turns. Loved it!!!! Gonna start the next book right away.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love any and all DVD singles or box sets I buy from Amazon. As soon as I received this, I watched it in its entirety. Awesome show.
B009L32R5I|5.0|This is like a new &#34;Best of Genesis&#34; CD with modern digital recording and top-rate musicians. I was skeptical that the vocals couldn't be replaced by anyone other than Peter Gabriel, but on many songs the performance, I dare to say, is BETTER than Gabriel, because these songs have stood the test of time and the vocalists know it. Well, not all songs stand the test of time...I would have left off &#34;Return of the Giant Hogweed&#34; as I think it doesn't fit with the other classics here. The playing is often more passionate and precise than the original version. Thank you Mr. Hackett for putting this together!
1401300529|2.0|I bought this book for a Korean War history class. I did not know anything about the Korean War prior to this class and this book was very informative. It seemed VERY word-y. The content was interesting, but the reader tended to lose interest because of all the sidebars. Like learning about MacArthur's entire family and childhood. I can see how some readers might find the background information beneficial, but I found it to be distracting. The writer appears to really know his stuff though! If the Korean War is a passion for you, you'll love it, if the War is a slight interest, I would look for something less tedious.<br /><br />The merchant was good. Book arrived on time, and in exceptional shape for being a &#34;used&#34; copy.
B007XNAQL0|4.0|This was taken from 16mm film, so it's not as sharp as we are used to on blu-ray. But this makes it as good as it can get. Audio is well rounded but I would have preferred more bass punch at times. The highlight songs are &#34;San Jacinto&#34; and &#34;Shaking the Tree.&#34; I absolutely hated &#34;Kiss That Frog&#34; and &#34;Digging in the Dirt&#34; and will skip those the next time I play this. It's nice to have a good Peter Gabriel concert with a head of hair.
082300659X|5.0|The look and tone of the book can be described as &#34;gentle&#34;. The drawings are beautful: graceful and muted in subdued colors. Although I have read other books on drawing and this one covers some of the same subjects, this book is more interesting. It just pulls me along, page after page.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|A group of over-the-hill action heroes poking fun at each other - entertaining if you don't take it seriously -
B008KEQMDC|5.0|I LOVE this movie!!  It is so hilarious!  The dynamics of it all and the humor are so amazing.  I saw it twice in the theater and pre-ordered it so I could get it the day it came out.
0547884591|3.0|The 4-hour Chef, was a okay read. But it didn't hold up to my expirations. The book was about meta-learning through cooking, and I was hoping for more focus on the meta-learning. I'm disappointed that he didn't mention things like spaced repetition for learning (other than off-hand, without mention what it is) and other techniques for learning. But you will learn some useful tips about cooking and learning, just not all the tricks that I know he have.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This show is amazing.  I have seen every episode and own all the seasons that are on DVD.  I love the thrill and I actually learn a lot from it.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Real Rev D of the Prolific chip.  Works out of the box for win 8.  Be careful of the lower priced models, they are either bogus Prolific chip or the 2303 Rev A which has no driver support in win 8.<br /><br />The serial end is not designed correct however.  These plugs usually have screw clamps as in a male to a female.  Don't know what they were thinking, but easily solved with a male to female adaptor or cable as in C2G / Cables to Go - 02711 - 6ft DB9 M/F All Lines Extension Cable  which saved the need for a USB extender cable.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This movie was a great action packed film.  I love science fiction movies and this one was awesome.  Perfect addition to X-Men series.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this series . It never ceases to amaze the twist and turns of the plots. I can't wait until the next episode!
B0064W65UM|5.0|This graphic novel looks really good on the kindle, V for Vendetta is a must have for comic lovers everywhere
B0099114WO|3.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones' stellar performances draws out the disturbing storyline of a husband with major intimacy issues who keeps his wife at bay by controlling and bullying her. Their relationship issues weren't merely loss of passion and boredom. The film was strategically marketed as a comedy, but the sex therapy was more awkward than funny. The shame is that the main plot reinforces the concept that sex is the solution to troubled marriages.<br /><br />[...]
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Great story, great cast, great movie.  Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are fantastic.  Will remain in my collection for a long while.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have been a Mitch Rapp fan since Vince Flynn's first novel with this character and have read every book.<br />&#34;The Last Man&#34; I feel, is the best yet by Mr. Flynn and looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />In this world today we need hero's and even if they are in the images that form in our minds while reading a good book...Mitch Rapp is my Hero.<br />I did not want this book to end...I wanted Mitch to keep searching out elements that wish to bring harm, cause distruction and distroy our freedoms.<br />America is still the greatest country on this planet and one can only hope there are those out there like Mitch Rapp who strive to protect this great nation and the people in it.

B0041O40EI|3.0|I was ridiculously excited to do this puzzle. I thought it was going to be great to have a map of London, both from 1666 and 2014, and had plans to mount it. I don't usually do puzzles, and though this one was hard with the limited variation in piece size and shape, but I liked the challenge. If you don't use the provided guide, then it is extremely difficult to put together, but if you follow it, then it's easier.<br /><br />My disappointment began to grow with the second layer. I expected it to be more detailed that it was. The completed second layer is pretty flimsy, as there are many border parts that aren't connected, but it was still decent.<br /><br />Where this product jumped the shark for me was the buildings. The timeline shows detailed buildings, where in reality the pieces themselves were little more than smooth, plastic bricks. There are several that are identical and it is impossible to know which one goes where even looking at the map. That was extremely disappointing. I also had issues fitting some of the pieces into the puzzle. The area around my Buckingham Palace is bowed because the plastic piece is to big for the puzzle. This might be nit picking but I wanted my Tower Bridge to line up with the road. I agree that it would have been more interesting to design the puzzle to go more west of Buckingham Palace than east but, oh well.<br /><br />I enjoyed it for the most part, but the end result was kind of a let down.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Just like the CD, this is a great bunch of music that is fun to watch the show and listen to. Whetehr listening to the CD or watching the show it's a great gift of music.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|If you like shows like &#34;24&#34; this is 100x better and far less cheesy. Amazing performances from Claire Danes, Damian Lewis and especially Mandy Patinkin. I watched the entire first season in about 4 days. The wait for Season 2 is excruciating!!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is really a biography of four different men.<br />The story of each of their lives combine to give a picture of much of the social life and politics of the early to mid 1800's.<br />I have yet to finish this book only because I want to read it slowly.  I love the language of the day, so eloquent and intellectual at the same time.<br />I will add a comment when I finish the book.

0812993292|3.0|Please note that this review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />From the beginning it would be impossible not to feel the quiet desperation of Harold Fry. A sixty-something aged man, newly retired & languishing in a stale & unhappy marriage, full of regrets & painful memories.<br /><br />An unexpected letter arrives & changes things. In a most improbable twist Harold embarks on a walking journey from South to North England, some 627 miles, in the misguided idea that he can save an old friend from the ravages of cancer. As misguided as this idea may seem it speaks to the intangibles such as hope & faith & redemption.<br /><br />While the story may seem dismal & depressing it is written with such heart & hopefulness that you find yourself rooting for Harold to press on no matter what.<br /><br />Harold is joined by an assortment of characters with their own ulterior motives (as I am sure is exactly what would happen in real life). Harold did not ask for their company & both Harold & I were glad to see the last of them when they left.<br /><br />However, it is at this point that he feels he can't go on. Only with the help & encouragement of Maureen, the harridan wife left behind, does Harold manage to carry on his journey to the end. Harold's absence has give Maureen something to think about & you can feel her change of heart taking place.<br /><br />Apart from the few typos (I presume) of wrong words & a few tiny inconsistencies & coincidences, which would normally annoy me, I couldn't stop reading as I was so invested in Harold getting to the end of his journey. Throughout Harold relives his past & with each chapter a little more is revealed so you want to continue because you know there is more to come.<br /><br />Harold Fry is an ordinary man who did an extraordinary thing & I rejoiced for him.<br /><br />Note: I can see no comparison with `Major Pettigrew's Last Stand' except for the fact that both are set in England & both are elderly men. For me personally I preferred the story of `Major Pettigrew' but that is not to say that Harold's story is not good. It's just different.rred the story of `Major Pettigrew' but that is not to say that Harold's story is not good. It's just different.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy is not just an erotic romance ....it's about child abuse, the admiration and love a man has for his mother, the respect and adoration a woman has for a step-father, and the love that is capable of developing between a man and a woman. I can't think of one person who wouldn't want a relationship like that which develops between Christian and Ana.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|this is for my grandson for Christmas so he hasn't received it yet.  But he is a HUGE lego fan so I'm sure it will be a hit.
034580404X|5.0|I liked the price of this trilogy, compared to other stores in my country. And I wanted to read it in english
0345803485|1.0|Boy was I looking forward to this book. Was on the waiting list at the library for a long time and now that I received it, I am so glad I did not spend one red cent on it.  In all honesty I could not make it through the book - and after waiting so long I really tried.  Made me feel like I was 14 years old again and reading another \\"True Romance\\" magazine while babysitting.  Very disappointed.  Returned it to the library and cancelled my holds on the rest of the trilogy. Save your time and your money.  As another reviewer suggested, read a sample on Amazon, it will be enough.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|Occasionally, an album captures something so real, relevant, and awesome in the truest sense of the word, that it stands out from all the rest.  Listening to this music is an experience not to be missed.  I'd like to see it get more attention so that audiences who missed it earlier can enjoy it.  Sting deserves major credit for taking this creative leap.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Love this movie so much. I have seen it about 10 times at lest by now. Only problem was that the digital copy for the movie/music was damaged... But the other two were fine.
0525952926|1.0|Why is the Kindle price at $19.99 and the paperback at $12.99 Even some sellers are selling the hardback for $15.99. I've had my Kindle for 3 years but it just seems like Amazon has gone crazy with their pricing now of Kindle books.<br /><br />Won't be buying the second book of the Trilolgy until it comes down in price for the Kindle, if it ever does.
B00000IQV7|5.0|Really like this movie a lot. Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors of all time because of how funny he can be. Also the fact that this movie is based on a true story.
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|This is a great new album from GY!BE, as if it were only last year that their last one, YANQUI U.X.O., was released (it was actually late 2002, almost exactly 10 years before 'ALLELUJAH!).  The material was mostly written back in the 2002-2003 timeframe, so it's not surprising that there is strong continuity.  Like the 2002 album, the new one is entirely instrumental, without the prominent vocal samples that were an integral part of the sound of their earlier recordings.  There are two main tracks, and two shorter \\"drones\\" without the intensity and cinematic sweep of the longer pieces:<br /><br />1) Mladic<br />2) Their Helicopters Sing (drone)<br />3) We Drift Like Worried Fire<br />4) Strung Like Lights at Thee Printemps Erable (drone)<br /><br />'ALLELUJAH hits harder with more tribal percussion than the last (though the idea that YANQUI U.X.O. was a quiet album is quite absurd) and the Steve Reich influence is less noticeable.  Sophie Trudeau's electric violin is one of the most distinctive elements of the band's sound, over massed guitars and percussion.<br /><br />The lineup hasn't changed too much.  The 8-piece band has only a few subtractions and additions:<br /><br />Thierry Amar -- electric bass, contrabass, cello<br />David Bryant -- electric guitar, dulcimer, portasound, kemence<br />Bruce Cawdron -- drums, vibraphone, marimba, glockenspiel<br />Aidan Girt -- drums<br />Efrim Menuck -- electric guitar, hurdy gurdy<br />Michael Moya -- electric guitar<br />Mauro Pezzente -- bass guitar<br />Sophie Trudeau -- violin, SK5<br />(and Karl Lemieux -- 16mm film projections)<br /><br />Another reviewer says the album was recorded by the four core members -- that is not correct, it is a misreading of the liner notes.  Two of the tracks were mixed by four of the band members, but the entire band plays throughout.  This is a leftist collective after all, no elitism!<br /><br />I had the good fortune to finally see GY!BE on tour playing the album on October 5th in Atlanta.  It was a great performance, with no vocals and no light on stage drawing attention to any of the individual musicians.  A primitive looking collage of videos and still photos is projected throughout the concert.  Without any lyrics,  powerful moods of despair, anger, defiance, hope, and ecstasy are conveyed, and a utopian vision of an egalitarian world without war, poverty, or ecological destruction.<br /><br />The images that accompanied the high point of the night, \\"We Drift Like Worried Fire,\\" were fires burning, the burning of fossil fuels that is destroying the climate and the ecosystem, it seemed clear to me.  With Canada now madly mining the tar sands of Alberta and the U.S. fracking up the land, we are clearly moving in the wrong direction.<br /><br />I am glad that GY!BE decided to reunite -- their vision is an inspiration to keep up the fight for the future.  This is a great soundtrack for the massive collective direct action we need to stop the Fossil Fuel Industry's ecocide!tlanta.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is the absolute best weather available.  The format gives you weather for your zip then you can break it down hourly, for 36 hours or for 10 ten days.  There is also an excellent map.  Anyone who boats or does outdoor activities this is incredibly handy and is in a better format than the weather.com on a PC.  The maps allow you to see weather as it develops around you.

0316228532|1.0|I was curious to read this book by J.K. Rowling, if for only to see how different her writing would be from Harry Potter. Whoa, I didn't expect to be so bored that I finally gave up and stopped reading the thing. My fear is that someone in my book club will choose this book. I'll go to the meeting of course, but it's going to take a lot of wine poured to get me to stay.
B008M34INW|4.0|I rented this movie several months ago because no matter what, in my opinion, Mel Gibson is a very talented, excellent actor, writer, and director. After an eight year absence, it was truly wonderful to see him make a comeback in this movie (which he also wrote). One thing this movie teaches us is that no matter how crazy a person gets in real life, if they've truly &#34;got it,&#34; it doesn't go away. The title tells you nothing, so you just have to go by the reviews on this one and it still consistently gets four stars because it is just that good. The storyline is a bit unbelievable, but that's not what makes this movie worth watching. What is worth watching is Mel Gibson doing what he does best - transforming himself into the character with perfect timing, touches of just the right amount of humor, and never straying or allowing the action to overwhelm the story or the characters involved in the story.<br /><br />Story run down: he ends up in a Mexican prison, this weird sort of shanty town city inside of prison walls filled with corruption, drugs, prostitutes, odd sorts of restaurants and housing from District 9. In the midst of all of this, he meets a 10 year old boy who he sort of takes under his wing. Actually, the boy teaches Mel, and in the end, Mel does what Mel does best. In his wonderful playfully mischievous way, reminiscent of his earlier films, he saves the day (sort of). This film is quite violent and the language is colorful, so it is not for the kids.<br /><br />But for those of us who remember Mel from Mad Max, the brilliant Lethal Weapons, Payback. Conspiracy Theory, Ransom and so many more, he is back! I'd really like him next to make a movie like We Were Soldiers, The Patriot and perhaps my favorite Mel Gibson movie ever - Braveheart, but I am just happy to see his brilliance shine through once again in Get the Gringo. I highly recommend this movie whether you are a fan of Mel Gibson or not. It is so much better than most of what Hollywood is offering these days.offering these days.

B00821OX98|3.0|The only reason I bought Season 1 of Falling Skies is that Season 2 was just so much better, I wanted the full set. This is why we have to stick with a show! I get so annoyed when people watch 3 or 4 episodes of a show and decide it just isn't very good and turn it off. Instant gratification has been responsible for the loss of many brilliant shows. I'm not sure why TNT decided to pick this up again because this season was....OK. There was way too much talking, too many emotional scenes and not nearly enough action in Season 1. I love sci fi, so I stick with pretty much anything in that genre. Especially when the story is a post apocalyptic thriller. However, I admit that I almost dropped this show because Season 1 was so slow.<br /><br />As for the characters, when I first found out that Noah Wylie was going to star in a sci fi show, I didn't believe it. I honestly didn't think he had the acting ability to handle guns and bombs and monsters. I was wrong. He is fantastic in Falling Skies. Then there is Moon Bloodgood, a personal favorite of mine who plays the show's doctor. Will Patton who is also one of my favorite supporting actors. And a whole bunch of new young actors I do not recognize, but who carry this story. This is one of those shows that just came together suddenly, became family, and it all made sense.<br /><br />After the mediocre Season 1, the producers listened to what the fans wanted and Season 2 came out of the cable almost a different show. Less soap opera, much more action. A lot more information on the aliens (in this show, the thrumming noise they make actually gives me the creeps, and monsters usually don't scare me), more information about the children taken by them and what happens to them, much more edge of your seat action. So, it often pays to stick with a show, and that includes TNT, who gets a high five from me for not dropping this one, something NBC and ABC do way to often to the point that I don't even watch new shows on those networks. Why get hooked when it's just going to get canceled? Nevertheless, you need to buy and watch Season 1 to understand the characters and stories in Season 2. So definitely start from the beginning and understand that Season 2 will knock your socks off! The only thing I am upset about now is that we have to wait until next summer for Season 3!s.

0547884591|5.0|I believe this is my first Amazon review..in part because I am lazy and I read way too much to do a pseudo-book report to help promote a book every time I read and love something. Why did I write this because Tim Ferriss asked and I gladly would help anyone that askes and I want to. I have been a Tim-aholic since I guess 2007/2008 when my old roommate introduced me to lifestyle design via his first book \\"The 4-Hour Work Week\\" I ate up the ideas, the blog and became lifelong fan. Over the years I hopped on and off reading the blog but always waiting for the next great thing I can learn about Tim delivers time and again. Tim is one author that never disappoints this voracious Non_Fiction fan. So I ate up 4-Hour Body and now his current title The 4-Hour Chef. As a one of my vocations as a graphic artist I loved the book for its color and pictures, color tabs for reference and even though the books is hefty in size it will stand the test of time if there is a Zombie Apocalypse. Maybe it could be used as a weapon perhaps or for handy info for survivalism. Even if doomsday doesn't come round the book has just cool how-tos on cooking, learning or Meta-Learning, science and awesomeness to impress significant peeps at your own dinner party with oooh, aaah, and how did you pull this off?<br />My favorite sections thus far are the SCI sections as well as seeing on page 77 (7) How to learn the first 100 signs in ASL. This impart because my awesome baby nephew is hearing impaired and it will help me learn foreign languages faster. It's true, Tim said so.<br /><br />I highly recommend this entertaining and informative book. Now go forth and be AWESOME!<br /><br />Love and Hugs,<br />Jen
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Reading about Near Death Experiences (NDEs) helps to put life in perspective. Getting a glimpse of the 'other side' is both comforting and reassuring. Now add the credibility of a neurosurgeon, who prior to his NDE was polite, at best, to his patients who described their NDEs, and you have a book that is a must-read. Dr. Alexander's passage from life-to-death and his highly descriptive account of the stages of his descent and ascent is a thrilling page-turner. I believed before. Dr. Alexander sealed the deal.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|It has been eight years since the Batman took the wrap for the murder of District Attorney Harvey Dent. Eight years since the last time the Dark Knight was spotted in Gotham. The streets are safe, the police are receiving praise for doing a good job--except Commissioner James Gordon knows it's all based on a lie. About to come clean of what really happened that fateful night, Gotham is suddenly thrown into chaos at the hands of a mastermind, muscle-loaded criminal named Bane. With the city about to fall, the Batman must return to restore order to his beloved city otherwise it will fall into the hands of a sadistic genius bent on its destruction. To complicate matters, a mysterious female cat burglar is working out an agenda of her own and her endgame is tied into the legacy of Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />Will Batman rise from the shadows to defeat evil once more, or has he had his day and should have stayed in the dark?<br /><br />Saw the midnight screening of this gem before it hit theatres all over the world. This movie is epic on a scale that is hard to fit into a simple review, especially since I don't want to give away any key plot points and/or spoilers.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises picks up immediately after The Dark Knight storyline-wise, and eight years later in movie-time. Running throughout the whole flick are threads from Batman Begins and Dark Knight, plotlines that reach their ultimate climax in what I have to say is one of the best endings to a trilogy I've ever seen. It's on par with, third-movie-wise, Return of the Jedi and Return of the King. All comes to a head as we're led down a deep tunnel into who Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) truly is and what being Batman has done to him. Glimpses of his scarred psyche were hinted at in the previous two movies, but really get hit home in an emotional and powerful way throughout this final installment.<br /><br />Batman himself also shines as he gets to show off his physical skill against a villain that can truly stand toe-to-toe with him, something we never saw in the previous two films. The battle with Bane (Tom Hardy) is realistic, strongly-delivered, and one where this reviewer felt the punches thrown as if it was happening to him. Yeah, it was that good of a fight.<br /><br />The other Bat-flicks struggled with having two villains in the same movie. To be honest, I never thought I'd see the day where a superhero movie would have more than one villain and be just as good of a movie as if it had just one. Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is the best rendition of the character I've seen on screen, both in movies and on TV. She had to play multiple roles given her identity as a thief and work her deception in such a way that a lot of the time we weren't sure who's side she was on. I'm an Anne Hathaway fan, but this movie easily contains her best career performance to date.<br /><br />Bane was a crazy good villain, a kind of cross between Joker--intelligence-wise--and Ra's Al Ghul--combat-wise--of the previous two movies. Especially since most of his face was covered with a mask throughout the whole flick, Tom Hardy had to act with his eyes in such a way as to deliver a performance as if he wasn't wearing a mask at all. It was something he did in spades. Bane was one of those on-screen villains that you were afraid of because he's that smart and that powerful and that sadistic.<br /><br />Gary Oldman did an amazing job, as usual, as Jim Gordon, and Sir Michael Caine nailed it once again as Alfred. In fact, I'd be shocked if Sir Michael didn't get an Oscar nomination for his emotional portrayal of a hard-headed vigilante's butler.<br /><br />It'd be so easy to give away several key plot points in this review, but I'm keeping it vague on purpose because you simply need to see this movie for yourself. You might think you have it figured out, but you'd be wrong, my friend.<br /><br />All dangling story threads from the previous two movies are resolved, the SFX did its job but the movie didn't rely on it, and The Dark Knight Rises had one of the best movie endings in history, to me, one equal to the incredibly-satisfying ending of The Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />Hats off to director Christopher Nolan and crew for the amazing stories and respect they delivered to Bat-fans everywhere throughout the entire Dark Knight Trilogy.<br /><br />Good watch Batman. You must return to Gotham.<br /><br />You must.<br /><br />Recommended.vie didn't rely on it, and The Dark Knight Rises had one of the best movie endings in history, to me, one equal to the incredibly-satisfying ending of The Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />Hats off to director Christopher Nolan and crew for the amazing stories and respect they delivered to Bat-fans everywhere throughout the entire Dark Knight Trilogy.<br /><br />Good watch Batman.

B005LAIIHG|2.0|see it in 3D theaters instead because I felt the story was lacking. I don't know how the book is since I've never read it but the film didn't seem to have a story and characters that are very compelling. Ang Lee and his screenwriter needs to receive some credit in turning this tale into a feature movie, however. A story about a boy on a boat with a tiger where nothing much really happens except basic survival is difficult to shoot but Lee seemed to do as nice a job as it is possible given that challenge. Seeing the 3D version of the film may be the only redeeming feature of the movie. The 3d adds a depth not only to the images but to the story telling as well. Its use to convey depth in space is incorporated nicely by Lee into giving sense of loss and loneliness the boy feels in the ocean with all these non human animals in the boat and in vast the ocean. So while beautiful, original in its uses of CGI technology and poetic, these are the only reasons to see it as the story was lackluster and the characters also a little dull.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Only on Chapter 9 but enjoying it so much!! Amazing character detail. It does take a little bit to get into the story but stick with it! Very good!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book was a real eye opener for me. In the last 4 years or so I have suspected I have issues with wheat, gluten or both. After reading this book,  I know I have issues and am now wheat free. I look forward to seeing many healthy results in the way I feel. I especially notice now that after I eat lunch I have energy and continue my day with energy not that sluggish high that made me feel awful and always brought on a nap. The chemical information in the book about how the wheat affects our bodies is a little much for me but I highly recommend this book to anyone who eats!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I never thought I would see something on tv that would rival Lost, but the folks at AMC have done it. This season has taken everything to a new level. A new level of emotion, intensity and action. Plus, if you're into the whole zombie apocalypse thing, then you won't be disappointed in that category--despite all the character development and drama. I highly recommend this. So much so, that this is the first review I have ever written on Amazon.com.

B0085TKAW6|3.0|Fall of Giants was a good read but Book 2 of the trilogy was not in the same league.  I finished it but only because i was on long leg international flights.  I will still buy Book 3 but look forward to it with less enthusiasm after reading Winter of the World.
B00ADYYY50|1.0|Been a fan of Wiz since some of his mixtape hits like \\"Say Yeah\\" and \\"Paper Planes\\". I never liked any of his hits off this album that play on the radio but i decided to give it a listen and bought it. All i can say is I REGRET buying this album. Every song is about money and all the beats are nothing special. I only liked one song on this album. Dont buy this trash. Support the REAL and not the PHONIES.

B008N1V11U|2.0|I bought this game cuz of all the hype and it was only $0.99... I regret buying it. Althought the game is great with good story and all the things you can do. It lags so bad at some points that can get you killed. I have the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and The graphics could be much better. in the cutscenes you can see so much pixelation on the faces it's so bad. and it has a few glitches where sometimes you can see through batman's chest like he has a hole on his chest. 2 stars only. Gamelof just keeps lossing my respect.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Heard Imagine Dragons on Pandora and had to hunt this awesome music down!  The whole family loves this group!  Looking forward to hearing more from them.  'It's Time' sucked me in, 'Amsterdam', 'Radioactive' and 'On Top of the World' didn't let me go!

Although their methods are ruthless in the beginning, they find redemption and normality in the end.

B007SUW24W|4.0|Ed's work is a breath of fresh air in a pop radio world filled with stars who appeal mostly to teeny-boppers and tween-age girls. What a nice change of pace!  Of course, if you were expecting a rock album, you would be disappointed, but his ballads speak to the realities of our lives. I think everyone can find at least one song they can relate to.<br />And if nothing on his CD appeals to you, check out the songs he writes for the \\"stars\\" of today's music scene-- Taylor Swift and One Direction.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is a very well researched book and well written, no doubt.  However, it has been affected by the erotic trend prevailing at this time and makes it more of a soap opera.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I love this game and it is so easy to play on my new Kindle Fire HD.  Graphics are good and fun to play.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I highly recommend this excellent movie! Superb cast of first rate actors, veterans and newcomers alike. The story is of several retired people, couples and individuals, looking to find a warm place to eke out their dwindling incomes. They each opt for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, lured by the beautiful pictures and glowing descriptions in the glossy brochure, but the reality that awaits them is somewhat different. The actual hotel is woefully (and comically) short of its promise. The inhabitants (including the manager) react according to their characters, providing comedy, tragedy, joy and triumph.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm sad it took me so long to read this book. I thought it was magnificent. It was really easy for me to relate to the main character. I enjoyed the first person perspective and the letter form of the book made it feel really personal. I didn't want the book to end and I can't wait to see the movie (I hate seeing the movie before I've read the book!)
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This cover for my kindle works fine -- the way it is supposed to. I do have a suggestion , if this sleeve is ever redesigned have a place to store a stylus.<br /><br />P.S.  I feel as though I am back in school and doing homework with all these evaluations for Amazon.
B005R32L66|1.0|Not working with an Android tablet, nothing to say, must be a Skype/Android problem and Skype knows and won't fix it ;-(
