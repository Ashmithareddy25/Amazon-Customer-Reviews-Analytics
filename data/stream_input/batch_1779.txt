B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The perfect christmas movie. This movie symbolizes all of the joy and magic that christmas held when we were kids...
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|ok so I got this app played it to find one cheaper than minevraft there possible death everywhere. its impossible to move and u don't even have time to build a safe house.  the only reason I gave it 1 Stat was because I have to this app is a total rip off don't even think about the full version
0547884591|5.0|If you've read this far into the reviews then you want it too.  Thanks for writing a cookbook for smart people.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love this game! Would have given it five stars but that the kindle fire hd is not configured with face book is very disappointing.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|horrable on my kindle fire hd it will not let you put in your location very bad want my money back
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book, just as much at the first one. I want to be Eva Tremmel in my next life. Written in the style of 50 Shades of Grey, I loved every word.  The fact that Gideion Cross loves Eva with all his heart is the best. I wish I had that unconditional love.<br />..
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|Usually I don't care much for progressive rock but Flying Colors is phenomenal. Instrumentation is precise but very inventive. The songs are great. Clearly a huge amount of talent went into its making. Hope we'll be hearing from them again!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|All seasons of BrBa are 5 stars.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Easy to open, wish it had a little more of full size app.  Meets my needs.  Would like more history.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I love any and all Tim Burton Movies.  This one came in a very cool collective case and I simple adore it.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I really like this movie and have been wanting to purchase it ever since I had seen it on tv.  I received it within ample time and have enjoyed having it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I have seen this before, and ordered it because it is great...plan on a girls movie night with this as the featured movie!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the best and most reliable alarm I've used on the Kindle Fire. It wakes me up every morning and that's no small achievement.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app has amazing demographics,  features all the characters from the well loved television show, and is enjoyable for people of all ages.  Best part it's free! You have nothing to lose. :)
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Read all 3 of fifty shades.  Storyline was good but thought all the descriptions of the sex was a little too much. Also it was hard to believe a couple could go through so much in such a short amount of time.  But I was hooked after reading book 1.
B003FXCSU4|5.0|Both entertaining and smart, this book is an absolute must read.<br /><br />The plot is very original, and the solution to the puzzle very good.
0385474547|5.0|Wonderful complex novel about Africa, before and after contact with the white man.  It is fascinating as an inside-out view of the workings of a \\"primitive\\" society.  But it takes things to another level -- it works brilliantly as a novel.  The characters are fully realized, and one becomes emotionally involved in their struggles. The central character draws together  the two aspects of the book -- a book about a very different society and a book about an individual human being -- and his ultimate fate has the inevitability of tragedy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The third season has been awesome! Some of the episodes are gripping from start to finish. If you're contemplating buying this season, you won't be dissapointed!
B0098TL4YU|5.0|This album is a gem from beginning to end.  Almost all of the songs encourage listeners to try throughout their lives to continue to follow their dreams, something that Jamison at age 61 has continued to do and has reached a high point in his career with this album.  Nor does the album lack a social consciousness as evidenced in &#34;Street Survivors.&#34;  I particularly love &#34;Walk On (Wildest Dreams&#34;).  It's a great song to sing at the top of your lungs while driving alone in the car.  In &#34;Calling the Game&#34; I think Jimi may be telling his Survivor bandmate Sullivan that he doesn't need Survivor's permission to follow his own star as shown by his work with Kimball and his &#34;History&#34; CD with Fred Zahl.  In addition to the vocals I love the sounds of the background instruments, which I usually don't pay attention to.  As a Survivor fan from the 80s this album meets AOR requirements to a T.  But I think the younger generations should also appreciate it.  I recommend it for those of us in our 60s as well as those in their younger years.  If I have any complaint of the CD, it is that in &#34;The Air That I Breathe&#34;...on my equipment...the word &#34;you&#34; often sounds like &#34;chu.&#34;  I don't know why.
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|I have listend to Fear Factory since the beginning.  They are one of my favorite bands and have been a force in the industrial sound.  My personal favorite is Obsolete.  I will say my least favorite is Digimortal.  Soul of a new machine, Demanufacture and Mechanize were all great albums in my humble opinion.  If you have followed Fear Factory over the years you know about their rocky relationship between the band members.  Burton has always been there.  Dino took some time off (or was kicked out) and did Divine Heresy which I also really enjoyed.  Raymond and Christian were there for a while but no longer.  The bottom line has been Dino and Burton for so many years and when you listen to their side projects you can hear the Fear Factory sound in them.  They get back to that sound with this disc.  It is great.  Personally I don't buy any CD's without listening to the 30 second clips that are available for each song.  I suggest you do the same.  It is the easiest way to make a decision on whether you like the tunes or not.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Okay well i love Katniss and Peta and think they should be together.<br />So Katniss is chosen to be the girl contender for the annual Hunger Games where the 13 districts compete to the death. This is a post apactaliptic novel. So Katniss is chosen as the girl contender and Peta as the boy contender. I know\\"OH NO\\". So the districts meet up in Capital and meet the others. Oh and you can only be chosen if your between the ages of 12-18. SO there are 12 year olds in here. They train for the battle and Katniss and Peta's Trainer guy that helps them along is always drunk and passed out. They don't think they have any chance of winning. They have a challenge type thing were they show judges their skills and get points 1-12 on how well they did.Katniss is the best on bow. Lets just say Katniss got an 11! So based on this score you get sponsers. Sponsers help you throughtout the games like sendsing you food or medicine. As the games begin there is a huge caticomb in the middle of a feild that has all sorts of weapons. Katniss runs toward it to get a bag that was left off to the side. She almost got killed. So as the games continue. She meets Rue a 12 year old girl and they stick together. I'll let you find out what happenes. An annoncer comes on air and says two contenders are allowed to win the hunger games from the same district. Katniss automatically looks for Peta. They stick together and pretend they are in love to make sponsers suppot them. They end up the last two people and then the announcer revokes the rule that two contenders could win. Katniss and peta say they can't live without one another so they are about to take poisoned berries when the announcer says they both win. The Capital is angry with them now.
0446580848|3.0|I love John Corey.. Having read every Nelson DeMille book. This was a disappointment.. Slow and wordy.. Not much of a story considering how long it was.. 8/10th of the book led up to a (kind of) anti climactic ending..Although Johm is still pretty snarky and lovable.. But the book was definitely not one of his best...
B0090P98Z4|4.0|its a good game but a little repetative there are good weapons but if you want great ones you have to use real money.
0316228532|1.0|Ahh. New Book, by JK Rowling.<br />-  YAY.<br />Expecting an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Couldn't find the story, perhaps it's well hidden, or just meandering.<br />-  Maybe it will get better?<br />Very confused. Have to diagram who the characters are and how they relate to each other.<br />-  Now I'm annoyed.<br />Quit counting the number of characters at 48.<br />-  No, it's not getting better.<br />Forced myself to read up to page 100.<br />-  Angry at wasting money and time.<br />Felt guilty for hating \\"serious book\\" by famous JK Rowling.<br />-  I think, is it just me?<br />Google, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" sucks.<br />-  WheW!<br />Many readers have similar reactions.<br />-  Throw book in garbage<br />Frustration dissipates.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I found this book informative about a slice of British life and certainly for mature readers. It was not, however, captivating or riveting to this reader.
0741470314|5.0|It's nice to finaly read a book about Michael Jackson, portraying him in a good way. It is an amaing book, i love it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app was so helpful and looks and works like a real calculator .it is perfect for your homework or buisness work.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Granted, the Kindle Fire HD costs a lot less than an IPad, but for what I just paid for the large, top of the line model, shame on you Amazon, this app should have been included. Having said this, let me also say I guess I know why I was given $10 to use in the app store. There's simply no telling what else should have been included but was not. I have the previous Kindle Fire as well as the Kindle keyboard. Yes, I will keep the keyboard model as it works best out doors. Having two Fires is simply an excess so I will let my nephew have the older Fire. I am truly enjoying the HD and can't wait to take a few videos and shots. I think another app you may want is a file explorer type so that you can delete anything you don't want as I'm not that sure you can delete by pressing the pic till the delete menu appears from within this app. I'll try to update this review when I've had time to better explore this app. In the mean time, I hope the next Fire also has a rear facing camera.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|game is a lot of fun, uses a lot of logic skills--keepin the brain sharp. doesn't give very many help lines but that just means more thinking. overall it is a good game plays well and not many pop up ads.
B001DHXT20|4.0|Played perfect except for about 45min into the movie it stopped with the pictures flashing differeent scene, this last for about 10 min of movie but my boys  still got the gist and enjoyed it and watches it over and over and over
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a wonderful miniseries, with a great story, good character development and beautiful costumes.  If you like period pieces and watch movies more than once, this is definitely worth the price.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|I really like this little controller.  It isn't as comfortable to hold as an Xbox 360 controller, but it isn't uncomfortable.  N.O.V.A 3 and Modern Combat 3 play even better now.  My favorite thing to do is to push the games out to my TV via Airplay using my Apple TV.  I leave my iPad in the stand that comes with the controller and it serves as sort of a 2nd screen.  Now I can carry my games with me when I'm out and when I get home I can continue on the TV.  This is the future.  Watch out Microsoft and Sony!!!<br /><br />Ok now the bad.  $80!!!  Wow that is expensive.  That is more than an Xbox 360 controller.  I found this little gem on eBay for $50.  That is still pricey for a piece of plastic that can only play a small selection of games.  I'm an early adopter though and I really think this is where gaming is heading.<br /><br />The controller is only compatible with Gameloft games.  The layout of this controller works great and would make a lot of other non Gameloft games even more enjoyable.  Ion iCade is able to span out with other developers.  Maybe Gameloft can license out the tech for others to use.  The iPad really needs a Universal controller that covers the whole spectrum.  Gameloft and the iCade show that the iPad is a great gaming device.<br /><br />I'm certain we are going to see great strides in the future of tablet gaming.  I really like the controller, but I think it is too expensive and I hate how we are limited to a small selection of games.  If you really like Gameloft games this controller is really a no brainer, but try and pick it up off of eBay until the price comes down permanently.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Don't be turned off by the pseudo-intellectual reviews you read here. This is an hour and a half 100% kick ass escape pod! Some of the other reviews here appear to be searching for some deeper meaning. Bullshit! Click on Play, suspend reality for a while and enjoy some good old fashioned sex, drugs and symphony music! Along with some pretty powerful gory violence. I enjoyed this amped up action thriller even more than I originally expected too. If you're looking for deeper meaning, join a convent.....I came for the opportunity to be somewhere else beyond my dull ass middle class American life for a few minutes, AND IT DELIVERED!<br />Well developed clearly distinct characters, a fun and dramatic story line, a little love as the motivator and believable special effects all culminate into a short story that probably won't change the outcome of your life, but will absolutely give you a two hour guilty pleasure erection! ....UUUh, but, of course, I'm a guy......
B00877R85I|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was gruesome and unbelievable, at the same time, scary that it could actually happen.  It's a future USA, where there is a Capitol, with 12 outlying districts.  The Capitol is a cruel master and people are basically just barely surviving.  Due to a rebellion, at one point in time, the Capitol instigates the Hunger Games to remind the people of what happens when you rebel.  Two children, a boy & a girl, are selected from each district, and sent to the Capitol for the games. The purpose is to be the last survivor.  The story follows Katniss Everdeen, and Peeta Mellark, and their exploits to survive.  I can't wait to read the next book.
B004EPYZTE|5.0|Jason Momoa plays a great conan way better then Schwarzennegger ever could the reason i gave it three stars is because the dvd froze everytime i put it in the dvd player and the disk wasnt scratched i think it came from the factory that way i will be buying another copy from amazon very very soon update i bought another copy and both the dvd and blu ray play fantastic if your a conan fan this film is the version you should buy and add to your collection
0547848412|3.0|I read this on someone's recommendation, and because the previews of the movie made it look like it would be good.  There aren't many books I have trouble getting through, but this one is a real slow starter.  I would call it a book of lists.  LOTS of lists.  LONG lists.  I think the high point of the 1st part of the book was Pi's religious beliefs, and when the 3 religious leaders converge on him, each thinking that he worships ONLY their particular religion, whereas he actually worships them all.  The book really starts with the ship wreck and his saga for nearly a year, in a lifeboat with, originally, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan, and of course, the Bengal Tiger.  Obviously, the other animals didn't last long, and most of the trip was made with the tiger.  The third part of the book is the interview with the representatives of the shipping line, whose ship sank.  That part was so well done, you could almost believe the whole thing was true.
159562015X|1.0|Need to tell us that the code is required for the test and is not available in the book.  I did not see that information.
B0026WNGBA|3.0|Good running guide.  My only issue is that I find the presentation overly complicated for such a natural running approach.  Like my own practice of tai chi-- it's easier than it is.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|I have to say this is a game that gives you focus and you dodge and its just great you have to play it.
0156027321|4.0|The book is in good quality, as described. I am happy to get this book but it took me too long.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thought it was a really sweet story.  And more believable than a lot of \\"accidental marriages\\" that other books are based on.  I downloaded it while I was having breakfast and finished it before lunch, so it is any easy read but I thought it still had substance to it.  I liked the characters, with all of their flaws, and loved the ending too.  Definitely a feel good book that made a dreary rainfilled morning much more tolerable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|great book cant wait to read the next!! These two books have been really good can't wait to start the last book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is one of my favorites(: I absolutely love it!! because its really really fun I think you should definately get it!!!ha
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love all 3 books....hope they make a movie , this is a fairy tale novel...love these books very much
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Saw most of the episodes when they aired on TV and loved this season of the show, so I decided that I wanted to own it.  Love the season, it is creepy though at some points but is a very enjoyable and is a pretty awesome show!
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|this is an amazing book! had me hooked from page 2 for an older book i really enjoyed it and wouldnt mind reading it again
B00004RFFW|5.0|I have always loved Mel Gibson in any movie.  This part is not as good as 3 but pretty good considering the feature
B00447L4JG|5.0|This is one of my favorites and hopefully will be son's favorite also. Can't wait to watch it together. Thanks!
B003VS0CYC|5.0|I owned these movies as a child , on vhs, and loved them.  When I seen them on vhs they worent very good. The quality of these BlU-RAYs are awsome. I love them couldnt be happier
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I accidentally got hooked on the Vampire Diaries when I was presented with an opportunity to design a jewelry piece for the stylist to consider for the show. After \\"researching\\" a few episodes I became completely hooked.  Season 1 was great, and season 2 even better, but 3 is my absolute favorite!  I started watching season 3 and then decided to watch from the beginning.<br /><br />I'm not a vampire fan nor am I typically into mystical fiction, but the actors on this show are easy on the eyes and every single episode is a game-changer.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Both of the books in this three book series are great so far and I expect nothing less from the upcoming final installment. The stories are serious but the subject matter is not so heavy that you have to worry. The characters become real and their struggles are relatable. If I were a teen reading these books I'd find myself connecting with and understanding them. However, as a mom in my 40s, I cringe at their stupid mistakes as ones I've made myself and wish I could stop them.<br /><br />Just because the sex in Slammed and Point of Retreat is implied instead of described, does not make the sex in these books any less desirable, in fact I find it's just the opposite. I don't want to read about heaving breasts or hot loins, I want to read about love and the physical manifestation of that love. And in these books that's what you get, in more ways than one.<br /><br />Sure, I can understand the reason for categorizing these books as \\"young adult\\" but I feel sorry for anyone that may not give them a read based on that label. I love these books, but fair warning, don't start if you have to work the next day because you won't want to stop until you're done.  But they're both an easy read so go ahead.<br /><br />Good stories, good cries, good laughs...good books.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|I am new to Halestorm and started listening when I found them while researching my Hale family line.The first song I heard was \\"I Get Off\\", I was hooked and couldn't get enough.I listened to everything they had.<br />This new album does not disappoint and I love every song on it. From the rocking of \\"Love Bites\\" which causes me to not be able to sit still to \\"Break In\\" which always makes me smile and cry because I have a feeling someone read my most private thoughts to write this song. The songs on this record are all amazing! Whether you are a new fan or an old one, you will love this!!It is a must have..
1593272200|5.0|By far, this is the most interesting book I've read about the Linux operating system.<br /><br />It contains fantastic coverage of a wide range of topics at varying levels of detail. The writing style is very appealing and the details are wonderfully selected and presented. The many chapters allow the user to explore each domain to varying levels of depth and breadth.<br /><br />We have to thank the author (a leading contributor to Linux documentation) for having taken the time to produce it with such level of attention and sensitivity to optimal organization.<br /><br />This is highly recommended for those who are looking for a book to learn about the details of Linux internals  in a lucid and exciting style.<br /><br />I have a paper copy -- beautifully printed and covered -- and I look forward to purchase a kindle version,  too . . .
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|...gawd, how can this album even come close to being considered \\"a miss\\".  There's not a dull or mundane song on this list.  They're all better than great...they're killer.  Harmony is so spot on perfect.  I was 12 yrs. old when I began listening to the Beatles in '63 and they've been my absolute favorite band since (yeah, I saw them on the Ed Sullivan Show while sitting in my living room listening to my dad go berserk over how awful they sounded).  Ahhh the memories.  Abbey Road is an absolute \\"must have\\" for any Beatles fan.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have enjoyed reading these books. I look forward to the next movie...you will, too.<br />Very moving story. Will miss it.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|I pre-ordered Long Wave without knowing anything about it other than it was something new from Jeff Lynne. ELO was my Beatles, as the Beatles were pretty much over by the time I was listening to music. Besides (and I know Jeff would hate me saying so), I never cared much for the Beatles, even though Jeff clearly idolizes and still imitates them to some extent. I much preferred Jeff's writing, vocals and of course, the swirling, twirling orchestrations in the best ELO albums.<br /><br />As for Long Wave, like some people, my first reaction was disappointment because Jeff didn't write the songs. And being a little younger than he is, I did not share an appreciation for these classics.<br /><br />But then I listened again and discovered what a gem this CD really is. Oh, btw, if you are wondering why you should buy the CD instead of just downloading the tunes, it has to do with the sound quality. Mp3s are okay, but the sound from the CD is superior and with anything that Lynne does in the studio, you want to catch every nuance.<br /><br />About the third listen I started to appreciate that these songs influenced his previous works. And being a true Lynnonite, I want to know what makes my music hero tick. God knows, it's hard to get anything out of his interviews...what few of them there are, that is. That's okay. I'm an introvert, too.<br /><br />His voice is as good as ever. I was worried, because the voices of many aging rockers don't hold up to their former glory. But Jeff's voice is as velvet like as ever! And the arrangements are superb. This guy is a master in the studio. No doubts there.<br /><br />My favorite cuts at the moment \\"If I Loved You\\" and surprisingly \\"Love is a Many Splendored Thing.\\" I say surprisingly because I always considered that such a sappy tune. But Jeff applied his Strange Magic to it, and POOF, it's a song and arrangement that has gotten caught in my head begging me to listen to it again and again.<br /><br />I won't give Long Wave five stars because I can't say that everyone is going to love the old classics, even though he does an amazing job with them. And further, I still would have preferred after all these years for songs that he'd composed. I know he's supposed to release something new, but it's an understatement to say that his fans are waiting for it. Hopefully, I'll be able to give that one five stars.rs because I can't say that everyone is going to love the old classics, even though he does an amazing job with them.

B005VPRGB0|5.0|They love love their LEGOs. They choose to put this together<br />rather than watch TV with the rest of us. Enough of a challenge<br />but didn't take long.  Very happy with end result.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Does not work. I downloaded based on its relatively high rating. I should have read comments instead. Looks like it hasn't been working for many people, at least not in last couple months.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is a blast to play! my son and I play it together and hr always beats me!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Bought this disc after seeing the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;.  My enjoyment might have been due to the story behind the music  but really the lyrics are pure poetry.  This is my &#34;go to&#34;  gift for my adult grandchildren. this year.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Love the show.  The book was just ok.  Not one of those I just can't wait to finish. Don't know if I will read anymore of these.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Spent $18 plus tax for Dozed Dollars and did not receive them.  Instead I got a message telling me that I need to reload the game!  Feeling very cheated and ripped off.  Please credit my Dozed Dollars or refund my money.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Its better than the. First one love the awesome  actors great movie...I can't  wait to own it to watch everyday...;)
B009329Y30|3.0|The movie was entertaining.  I read the book and the movie was not as interesting.  Zac Efron is a good actor.
B004LROMQG|4.0|Four stars because there's too much, Morgana and Morguese and not enough of Arthur and Guinevere together. Appreciate the humorous episodes. Loved when Arthur took charge and made his own knights and a commitment to use the round table. Angel Coulby is excellent! The whole cast is really great! Happy to see Lancelot back!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|get it because I played it on my brothers I pod absolutely loved it!really think you all who are reading this should get it
B001LF347E|5.0|I gave five stars because of the concept of putting a new twist on the old Arthurian mythology. The innovative way they developed the characters peaked my interest. It seems to have captivated the imagination of a whole new young generation.  Actually, they are addictive. The episodes never disappoint, regardless of the fact that we watch them over and over, again! The only problem I have is that Guinevere is not on the DVD covers. She, Arthur and Merlin are the main characters of the legends!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Overall a very good read.  Twisting plot kept focus most of the time but there were some parts that required a re-read to understand the story line.

0439023513|1.0|I had very high hopes for this book and it pains me to say that it fell short.  Being so engrossed in the first two books, I thought this one would conclude this fantastic story in a very powerful/effective way.  Utter disappointment.<br /><br />The first two books were truly captivating.  The most significant aspect of any good story are the characters in it, and the relationships they form with one another.  Characters are the ones who the drive the story and give it life and meaning, essentially the guts of the book.  I enjoyed reading about the two main characters, Katniss & Peeta, and their slow development towards a relationship.  Their arguments, their camaraderie, their tenderness, their love.  All moments we got in books 1 and 2, but did not resonate at all in 3.<br /><br />Book 3 was a slow, drawn out war story that had no character development at all.  The characters simply disappeared.  Everyone became pawns in another bigger game.  Their depth, personality, humor, gone.<br /><br />The most upsetting absence was Peeta's, both mentally and physically.  I fell in love with him in the first 2 books.  He was level-headed, strong and eloquent.  He loved Katniss whole heartedly and did everything he could to protect her.  Maybe through his absence, the author was trying to bring the point across of how lost she is without Peeta by her side, allowing herself to become yet another piece in this war game.  He would've been the voice of reason for her and without him, she was lost.  Point made, if that was it!  But what's lost needs to be FOUND.<br /><br />We all knew from the first 2 books who Katniss truly loves, even though she didn't know it herself.  Yet, when she was finally reunited with him, there's another hurdle they'll have to cross together, with him being hijacked.  They don't spend nearly as much time together to get over this hurdle.  Maybe because she was so lost herself, but Katniss didn't seem to want to find the real Peeta and bring him back.  This wasn't the heroine I knew from before.  I thought her motto was to save/protect him at all costs?  Instead, she just avoided and dismissed him completely.  I even found myself hating her at some points in the story.  It would've been nice to see her try to help him, and win him back because she finally realizes her love for him.  She does realize that if the tables were turned, Peeta would try to get her back in any way he can.  But even with this realization, she was inactive.  No effort on her part at all to save him/bring him back.<br /><br />Katniss went from being a strong heroine to a tortured soul, an aftermath of being in a war no doubt.  Kudos to the author for this realistic portrayal but she didn't have to beat us over the head with it.  Katniss has witnessed so many deaths, sacrifices, it is sure to change her forever but where is the resiliency of the Katniss we all knew and loved?  The one that had to grow up fast after her father died, take full responsibility for feeding her family, saving her sister from the Games, winning the Games and saving Peeta's life?  The only person I could think of to bring her back to life, to some sort of normalcy was Peeta.  Why weren't there any moments of them together where he could do what he does best?<br /><br />The author keeps us \\"guessing\\" to the very end whom Katniss picks, although we all knew who it would be.  Her lack of character development doesn't give the audience a good feeling when she does actually end up with him.  It was just given to us in one paragraph when we were expecting so much more to validate our belief in their bond.  Something the first 2 books did so well.  It just felt like he was there to pick up the pieces in the end and worst of all, it felt like she settled with him instead of really choosing him, and that's incredibly unfair to such a wonderful character.  He deserved more.  No declaration of love, no big realization of how much she needed him in her life to balance her out andmake her see the good in everything.<br /><br />I don't deny it was a page turner, but not the good kind.  I kept turning the pages, hoping to find the real Katniss, the real Peeta and their special bond together, but sadly I didn't find that.<br /><br />I hope and pray that if this book will be turned into a movie that they will PLEASE DO SOMETHING about this.  This is one of the few times where I am totally fine with them not going by the book.
B0054JELS4|4.0|I dont like that it says on here that they where new yet the cases where damaged a littel and some of the discs are skipping I dont want to return the whole thing for a return but cant find where to only return the discs that skip and get better discs

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Different than the movie- a lot more detail of Charlie's issues and thoughts. I feel the movie was more “feel good “ and the book challenged your emotions on a different level. Great book-everyone can relate to certain aspects of the story. And isn't Pittsburgh beautiful.

0547564651|4.0|This is an excellent book on some of the misconceptions, myths, and challenges that children face when attempting to succeed. Traits and skills previously thought fixed and unmalleable, like character, turn out to be mouldable, while IQ turns out to be a very unreliable predictor of success. The author chronicles  the challenges of a few teachers, students, and administrators as it blends glimpses into academic research with first-hand accounts of on-the-ground challenges faced by these people.<br /><br />The structure of the book is very, very self-explanatory - there are only five chapters in the book - \\"How To Fail (And How Not To)\\", \\"How To Build Character\\", \\"How To Think\\", \\"How To Succeed\\", and \\"A Better Path\\". For my money, I think the first and second chapters - \\"How To Fail\\" and \\"How To Build Character\\" are well worth the price of the book - you would do well to read these carefully.<br /><br />That many of US schools are not performing is not news. That several of these schools happen to be in poor neighbourhoods is also not unknown. Millions, and billions of dollars at the national level spent, and a score or more programs have been launched, scrapped, and launched - all in the hopes of improving measurable outcomes in the form of improved scores, lower dropout rates, sustained efforts that lead to more students finishing high school and college. All with varying degrees of success. The effort to find more fundamental causes of poor academic performance and poor social skills among students therefore continues.<br /><br />\\"In 2008, eighty-three school-age teenagers were murdered in the city, and more than six hundred were shot but survived.\\" The city being Chicago, where the \\"murder rate is twice as high as the rate in Los Angeles.\\"<br /><br />The book traces the efforts and struggles of people like Nadine Burke Harris, who was the \\"lead pediatrician of the Bayview Child Health Care Center\\", or Elizabeth Spiegel, school chess teacher at the Intermediate School 318, where more than 60 percent of the students \\"were from low-income families\\", and which was also the \\"best middle-school chess program in the United States, bar none.\\" In following the lives of these and more people in the profession of education, the pursuit is to find out what are the building blocks of meaningful success in later life for students.<br /><br />More than parents' education, professions, or any other socio-economic indicator, it is the correlation between \\"Adverse Childhood Experiences\\" and \\"negative adult outcomes\\" that are very powerful. These were described in a medical journal article titled, \\"The Relationships of Adverse Childhood Experiences to Adult Health: Turning Gold into Lead.\\" written by Vincent Felitti. This is what causes children to fail, and hence the title of the chapter, \\"How To Fail (And How Not To)\\". For each category of trauma they had experienced, children were given one point by the researchers, and these categories included \\"physical and sexual abuse, physical and emotional neglect, and various measures of household dysfunction...\\".<br />What the researchers found was that \\"men with an ACE score above 5 were forty-six times more likely to have injected drugs than men with no history of ACEs.\\" It so happens that our human bodies evolved to deal with stress that dissipated within a very short amount of time - you either got eaten by a predator in a jungle, or not - and not with the stress that humans are subjected to in modern society - the mental stress that can linger for long periods of time. It is the body's reaction to stress that really kills us, not the stress. After all, how many times has your boss actually murdered a person, with their bare hands? Not very often, I would hope and assume. On the other hand, elevated levels of stress result in a hardening of the arteries over a period of time, and that leads to heart attacks. If adults cannot handle stress very well, imagine what havoc stress plays on the psychological and mental state of children.<br /><br />Lest we think that problems of underachievement are a problem only of those schools in low-income districts, the author points out that even in schools like Riverdale, where the affluent send their kids, children can be found wanting in grit. Schools such as Riverdale exist \\"not to raise the ceiling on a child's potential achievement in life but to raise the floor, to give him the kinds of connections and credentials that will make it very hard for him to every fall out of the upper class. What Riverdale offers parents, above all else, is a high probability of nonfailure.\\"<br /><br />And there in lies a valuable lesson - we cannot truly succeed in life unless we experience failure. Which requires the ability to tread off the known, safe, and beaten path, and try something different, not just for the sake of trying something different, but different based on a rational assessment of the alternatives. In other words, the ability to exercise cognitive self-control. \\"Cognitive self-control is the ability to inhibit an instinctive or habitual response and substitute a more effective, less obvious one\\" Now, researchers have demonstrated that \\"for infants to develop qualities like perseverance and focus, they need a high level of warmth and nurturance from their caregivers...\\" These traits are seeded at a very early stage in life. Being passionate about something can be \\"very liberating for kids\\".<br /><br />This book is filled with such nuggets of research, anecdotes of grit and perseverance. By the time I was halfway through, I realized that it - the book - follows a somewhat predictable cadence, which is not a bad thing in itself, at all. A flurry of research at the beginning of a chapter or section that summarizes and familiarizes us with the problem at hand, the status of research into that area, some of the people involved with the research, findings, open questions, followed by a long dive into personal experiences of the people and students in the field. Towards the middle and also in latter part of the book I felt that the narrative had become too skewed towards the narrative, and less so towards the analytical. It may well be the case that without reading about in some detail about the challenges faced by these students and teachers we may not truly appreciate the monumental nature of the task - I however felt some passages appeared more as filler, an attempt to get the book past the two-hundred page mark.<br /><br />A highly recommended, must-read for anyone wanting to understand the why and what of getting children to become more self-aware, develop character, and ultimately be happy in and with their lives.logical and mental state of children.<br /><br />Lest we think that problems of underachievement are a problem only of those schools in low-income districts, the author points out that even in schools like Riverdale, where the affluent send their kids, children can be found wanting in grit.

B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Unfortunately I bought this without trying the free version first. This app does not work. All it does is show the time and date. It also shows a never ending, \\"retrieving data\\" statement. But it never does retrieve any data. It only cost .49 and that's really not the point. I trust Amazon and have had many years of good experience with them. They completely dropped the ball on this one.  [ASIN:B006SMLAMQ Weather+]]

B003YCIE68|1.0|The actor who plays Santa Claus is wonderful, but even he can't save this horrible script. The story line is so bad and full of obvious holes that even my children won't watch it. Good thing we streamed it on NetFlix and didn't waste the money to buy it.

0743289692|5.0|This book is a most shocking and compelling life journey.  I was spellbound reading it and I was enraged for Ayaan and sad for her.  I was electrified when she made it to Holland and began her new life.  But through it all, I was struck by her indomitable spirit.  Do yourself a favor: read this book and learn about a culture, learn about tenacity and perseverance.  Become aware of all the pieces to the world's historical puzzle that this book brings forth.

0060507772|4.0|The Last Hero brings back several Discworld characters, notably Cohen the Barbarian and his gang on a last adventure, Leonard of Quirm and that persistent survivor Rincewind the inept magician, not to mention The Librarian. The story is not as long and complicated as the usual Pratchett book since most of the characters have appeared in previous books and are not as deeply developed here.  The story is strongly bolstered by  many wonderful, often-times intricate illustrations by Paul Kidby.  Discworld followers will find it worth reading.<br /><br />This is in a large (9-1/4&#34; x 11&#34;) glossy coffee table format which makes it a little less easy to curl up with but it's beautifully presented.<br /><br />It's a beautiful book and enjoyable
B008HK3XKO|5.0|It is not expensive. However, you got what you paid. I just use it as a protector and so it does.
0547884591|5.0|I found the latest book by Tim Ferris to be exactly what he promised (at least on his website).  It is a fairly complete guide for the absolute novice cook, taking someone from very basic dishes towards more complicated delicious fare.  It is also an amazing book about learning, leading to my choice of title.<br /><br />The 4 Hour Chef is really is really two separate books.  The first portion is really a treatise on learning in general, taken with the mindset of Pareto Efficiency (roughly meaning you can get 80% of the outcome from 20% of the work).  In the introduction and \\"Meta\\" sections, he lays out his mentality towards learning and his own process for taking a learning goal, breaking it down and seeing it through in the most efficient way possible.  If you're a Tim Ferris fan, and already a decent cook, this area of the book is probably what you will find most interesting.<br /><br />Much like 4 Hour Body, Tim encourages the reader to skip around and use what they need.  Looking at the lower reviews, some people seem to have gotten tripped up in the early sections as they were not about cooking, but more generally about learning.  My recommendation is to take Tim's written advice, which is to skip this section if you purely want to know about cooking, and move forward to the structured lessons/recipes.<br /><br />The larger second section of his book is focused on cooking.  In this portion, Tim leads the reader through a series of easy early recipes in order to give the reader some easy success to build upon.  This boosts confidence and teaches easy and basic (yet very important) techniques in a way that keeps the reader interested through success.  From here he builds upon the knowledge imparted to the reader and moves to more complicated recipes and techniques.<br /><br />All in all this book is a resounding success.  It teaches readers how to cook, but it also teaches them how to learn anything they want in the most efficient way possible.  Most people willpick it up as a cooking reference, and they will walk away not only as better chefs, but they will have gained a more important skill: efficient learning.
B0041KVXLA|5.0|This is probably my 5th review for the this reissue set. I have been purchasing these separately so I can properly absorb them sonically for detail and check for pressing problems.<br /><br />\\"With the Beatles\\" is the British equivalent to the American \\"Meet the Beatles\\" with some different song selections. To begin with, this pressing is in a different dimension than my American pressing. \\"Stunning\\" The detail is simply amazing. I am extremely happy with my copy. No warps,no distortion, no holes out of place,and dead silent in the quiet moments.<br /><br />I have pretty lucky so far, only the problems with the Pepper album as others have testified to. This record plus A Hard Days Night,Beatles for Sale,Help,Rubber Soul, Revolver are what I have so far.<br /><br />I plan to write other reviews as I buy more titles. I give this one a huge \\"thumbs up\\" if you don't have this in your collection already.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am still in search of a good Pepper pressing. I think I will repurchase that one last on my list after the dust settles.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|LOVE this show.  Probably one of my favorite seasons! I could watch it all the time and it certainly keeps you wanting to watch episode after episode.
B0041KVX1A|4.0|A Hard Days Night was not my favorite Beatles album, but it is still a good one. I actually never had a copy in my collection because some of the songs were on the American \\"Something New\\" LP so I never bought it. The British version however is a different story.<br /><br />It was an actual new record with all Beatles material. The US version had some songs from the movie along with  some orchestral pieces. I was not interested in that. Unfortunately, coming across a British pressing where I live and in decent condition was next to impossible. I had seen them at times going for \\"big\\" money because they were very rare.They weren't always in the best condition either.  When I heard these were being reissued, I was not going to be left behind on this one.<br /><br />As far as the quality goes, my copy was completely flat, dead quiet, and free of distortion or skips. I don't think it sounds quite as good as \\"With the Beatles' from this same series, but it's still very good.<br /><br />I have several titles from this reissue,WTB,BFS,HELP,RS,REVOLVER, plus this one. All sound good with no problems. I did have SGT. PEPPERS, but had to return 3 copies with no luck. I am apprehensive to buy another copy, but still may later on after the dust settles.<br /><br />To all the hoopla regarding the digital remasters, don't let that prevent you from giving these a listen. I think they sound great in my opinion.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I was wondering how Mark Ruffalo was going to fit that character, and it was a hit with me. I love Robert Downey, Jr in anything, and he is just great as the &#34;nutty genius&#34;, whatever costume he puts on. I believe everyone did a stellar job in this movie. I will watch it again when I have the time. I will watch something as many as four times over before I get my &#34;fill&#34; of it...so I will see how many times before I am done with this one!

I *knew* I was saving the better album for last.<br /><br />Anyway \\"Taurus I\\" contains the same type of Irish, orchestrated, instrumental multi-part, female chanting that Mike has been experimenting with since Tubular Bells, but come on now, don't think for a single solitary second that this can compete with the 24-minute slice of perfection that is \\"Taurus 2\\".  This is more like a brief hint at what's to come with Five Miles Out, but what a good taster it is!  If this were free food at the grocery store I'd be sneaking away with the whole tray of peanut butter crackers.  The intro has a REALLY beautiful Irish theme that's actually my favorite part of the song.  The piece then shifts in a really dramatic way that captures the feeling of rockets blasting into the sky before mellowing out halfway through with melodic Asian chants.  The second half of the song is quite the curiosity though- Irish themes that are sort of messy mixed in with the more space shuttle-like instrumental chops that first appeared in the beginning.  It's messy in an appealing kind of way since all the instrumental chops feel really adventurous despite how sloppy they may seem initially.  Pretty awesome song.<br /><br />The title song has a dreamy guitar piece in the beginning that should sound familiar to anyone who's heard even an ounce of Oldfield's work.  He uses that guitar technique in *all* his music it seems.  It's a glorious thing though.  A trademark sound I never get tired of.  Beautiful.  The vibes can best be described as optimistic and adventurous before Ireland comes back into the picture near the end with a marching theme.  Actually the entire song has marching elements but they're cleverly disguised under all the other arrangements so it took me a few listens to make out this stuff.  \\"Mirage\\" begins with a guitar line that reminds me of the line \\"I don't like you but I love you\\" from the Beatles \\"You Really Got a Hold On Me\\" classic.  Actually a quick google search reveals the Beatles didn't write that song- Smokey Robinson did, in 1962.  Anyway Mike's brilliant guitar work sort of jams along with the drumming and it's a really cool thing.  The whole song is based around that one guitar line but it works really well.<br /><br />Now for the rest.  In the future I normally dread the shorter pieces on Oldfield's albums, but not on this masterpiece from 1980.  \\"Wonderful Land\\" is a guitar instrumental sort of reminiscent of the spiritually uplifting intro from the title song but even better.  I wish this song were a couple minutes longer.  The acoustic guitar after the 2-minute mark is pure heaven.  \\"Sheba\\" is an experimental chant with female vocals and a vocoder in the intro.  This is probably the closest thing to filler on the album but... it's still great.  \\"Celt\\" is more of the same with less interesting results, \\"Conflict\\" is rather ominous in the intro before a swirly guitar line comes in and makes the piece super melodic, and \\"Arrival\\" brilliantly captures that feeling when you wake up in the morning and the sun shines through the curtains.  Even more melodic than the previous song I mention.<br /><br />Amazing feeling isn't it?  This is what Mike Oldfield's all about.  He's a master of instrumental beauty and feeling.  I wish he'd have stuck with this formula for his entire career but it wasn't meant to be, I'm afraid.  Pick up QE2 today.ou\\" from the Beatles \\"You Really Got a Hold On Me\\" classic.

0345803485|2.0|Let me start by saying I am an avid reader.  I read most genres, multiple authors and rarely have to abandon a book.  That being said...I just DON'T understand the hype over this book.  It really is JUST OK.  The two thing that stop this book from being bad are 1)I didn't notice any typos and 2)the emails that are sent between the characters in the book are funny.  Were it not for those two factors the book would just be bad.  The writing is solid.  The story is, simply put, boring and at times just stupid.  And did I mention the book is 500 pages long?  WHY?  I am sooooooooo glad I did not buy the trilogy.

B0002HLCGC|2.0|This looked so cute in the pictures but when I got it I couldn't believe how SMALL everything was! I wanted pots/pans that my little ones could actually put food INTO so I sent it back (amazon was great about the return).<br /><br />I did take out my measuring tape in case anyone wanted to have an idea the size: the pots are all only 3 1/2 inches across the diameter. Way to small to put any food into!<br /><br />Some of the utensils are an alright size,especially for little hands: The ladle was 6\\" long, but the pizza cutter was only 4 1/2\\" long and 1 1/2\\" across the circular \\"cutter\\". The plastic looked cheap like it wouldn't hold up very well, at least not with my boys! I don't have any first hand experience from actual play because I did send it back. Hope this helps someone else, pictures can be so deceiving with toy food and dishes!

B003WKOU0G|5.0|This was a remarkable film, I watched it for a class. It was amazing how all the babies came from a different culture yet still reached the developmental stages at around the same time. I would love a follow up to see how each of their cultures play a part in their future development, I am sure they will be vastly different.

B003V1WST6|3.0|This is a pretty enjoyable read. There are many hilarious scenes in the book and I loved Angela for her humorous self. The book started off great and fast paced but it gets slow in the middle and if I have not known this to be a serial read, I would say that the ending left out much for readers to digest.<br /><br />One very irritating thing about this book is the over-emphasis on branded products. Throughout the whole book, I have been reading about Marc Jacobs and Marc Jacobs and Marc Jacobs. Everything is about Marc Jacobs and about the 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'sigh', 'beloved' Marc Jacobs bag of Angela. Honestly, the first time I read about this, I was like \\"oooo a Marc Jacobs\\". The second time I read about it, I went \\"she really loves her Marc Jacobs bag\\". And when it began turning up more than once in a chapter , I was like \\"AGAIN?!?!?\\" I am beginning to wonder if Marc Jacobs sponsored this book. This took 1 star off the book.<br /><br />Putting that 'Marc Jacobs' thing aside, the book is readable and it would have earned one more star if the author had laid out the Tyler & Alex issue better. The ending seems rushed and the guys problem is like suddenly POOFED.<br /><br />I will still be reading the next 4 books in this series as I want to find out what happened to Angela.This is a pretty enjoyable read.

0545425115|5.0|Before the movie, I have no idea what is The Hunger Games. When almost half the world is obsessed with this, I am living in my own tiny world, having no idea that such a great book is out here waiting for me to pick it up!<br /><br />Having both watched the movie and read the book, the story are very closely linked and both of them are amazing!<br /><br />This book is definitely a page turner and had me captivated from the first to the last page. I couldn't put it down for long except for meals (because I am afraid of staining my book) and sleep.<br /><br />The story is very well paced and plot is perfectly laid out. It is so smooth and well written. If I have not watched the movie first, I would not be able to guess the ending! However, this doesn't even spoil my read. I have enjoyed the book a lot.<br /><br />I can't wait to start on the next book and also for the movie to be released!

B00AF619JU|5.0|First let me say, I probably skew the demographics on superhero TV and movies. I am a 52 year-old woman, and have loved the science fiction and superhero genres since I was 12. I love the X-men movies (all of them), most of the Batman movies, the first Iron Man movie,not crazy about Superman (too goody-goody for me, I like 'em dark!). I'm a faithful fan of the excellent Grimm, and the sometimes over-the-top Once Upon A Time. I even enjoy watching some of the animated Spiderman and others with my grandson (LOVE the Di-gata Defenders!). The best ones are archetypes, resonating in the soul.<br /><br />That said, my review:<br /><br />This series is really well-done, the cast is exceptionally strong considering their lack of fame, the acting is well above average for the genre, and particularly for a television series. It's dark, often creepy (but not so much that I wouldn't let a nine- or ten-year-old watch it), plenty of action, with a wonderfully believable set of characters. Stephen Amell is quite good, charming and gritty by turns, Katie Cassidy (Lauren) is quite talented and I really hope she gets a chance to show what she can do. Susanna Thompson (Oliver's mother), is a long-time favorite of mine (truly wonderful in NCIS as Lt.Col. Mann and Gibbs' brief love interest) has a character who is suitably deep and challenging for her. David Ramsey as John Diggle is prickly, distrusting and just cynical enough. His character is the one I am most concerned about, as it would be far too easy for the writers to allow him to become to prototypical \\"convert to the cause\\".<br /><br />The show gets a little moralistic, but that may serve as a caution to the intended audience to mitigate the violence. I like the way the producers/writers are filling in Oliver's 5-year absence while he was shipwrecked a little at a time, and can't wait to see where this goes.<br /><br />No, there isn't anything very original about the series, but it's so compelling that it hardly matters. I sincerely hope this stays on for a long time, provided the writing and the stories maintain their present quality!erely hope this stays on for a long time, provided the writing and the stories maintain their present quality!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|After many years ago of seeing  Short Circuit I decided it was time to add this to my library.  Wife and I watched it together and it was as good as it was a long time ago.  Someday if we ever have grandchildren it'll come off the shelve again and it will be just as good for young minds.

B00138H6KA|5.0|I found this lady on a You Tube Video sent to me.  Wow!  This lady is from France and I have never heard of her until now.  She sings in many languages beside French such as Russian and English  and does them all well.  What a pretty voice!  I highly recommend her, but you can hear her for your selves on a You Tube video.  Try her, you'll love her!
B0083IQFD2|4.0|I love this EP, it works great, but when i got it, there was a crease in the cover art as well as a small rip in the corner. CD works new, but the cover art was a dissapointment.
B001O03NCW|5.0|Saw the movie and loves the songs from many decades ago, with all the sound quality of today's studios.  This is top notch!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I've always had mixed feelings about Diana Krall.  She was encouraged to be a singer, not just a piano player because her record company saw a pretty face who might sell records. I think most of her early work was rather bland. She didn't sounnd convincing, like she didn't even want to sing. There were years and records where she was searching for her voice and the breathy sultry, coy phrasing seemed so forced to my ears. I do feel she has gotten alot better in the last six or seven years. But I have to marvel at this cd. I think this style of music fits her to a T. Her voice has really opened up. to my ears she sound better than I've ever heard her. Reviewers complaining about \\"get back to jazz\\" I find interesting. She's moving in a new direction and her 'fan's' don't like it...??  Her husband's probably telling her to whear it proud because this is almost like Dylan going electric and being cosidered a betrayer of folk music. Keep on going in whatever direction you want Diana, this is one really inspired record. You'll find a newer audience, one who willl follow you through the changes.
B00571F26Y|5.0|What an interesting book.  Really give great incite on a food that most of eat at every meal.  Whether we eat white bread or whole wheat, this food is not what most people know.  And it's not just about the gluten content of wheat either.  If you have digestive problems and or diabetes read this! We read it on our IPads (hey we have a couple Kindles too).  You'll find it is not all heavy medical jargon, but for the rest of us who speak English.  I have recommended this book to friends and they too have changed eating habits for the better.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Take a young boy scout, a crotchety old man, a giant, mystical bird named Kevin, a talking dog, a flying house, and a life-long dream and complicate it with an evil money-hound out to complicate that dream at all cost in the name of science and you've got the start of Up. This is a hilarious story full of twists, turns and a whole lot of fun. Some parts will bring a tear to your eye, some parts will make you rolls with laughter and others will have you white-knuckling the arms of your chair. The animation isso well done you can get lost in it and the soundtrack complements every aspect of this wonderful movie.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This movie was so entertaining that my whole family sat down to watch it with the kids. The director should get a stand up ovation. The director knew it was for children and they still used hysterical parts where the whole family laughs, without a regret for buying this movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The movie is perfect for playing in home cinemas and the sound 6.1 DTS HD is really HD. Honey for your ears. With a very nice presentation, like a book, is perfect for the collection. Highly recommended. Even for christmas is a very nice gift.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I really loved it.<br />Enjoyable to watch.<br />Movie for all ages.<br />Have watched it several times.<br />Makes you feel really good and inspired.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written book.  I raised 4 children, complete with the requisite pets.  Our dogs were well loved and sorely missed when they went to doggie heaven.  Though I wasn't the motivator when we invited these pets into our lives, I reaped the benefits of the awesome mixing of &#34;2-legged&#34; and &#34;4-legged&#34; &#34;people&#34; in my household.  We often wondered what our Nikki and Chilli were thinking about.  I wouldn't change a thing.  This book is a fine way to remember our own late, beloved pets, as well as a good primer for those young families looking to add a doggie person to their household.

So eager was I to read Anthony Bourdain's Insider Edition (for his insider notes) and having ordered it on my iPhone Amazon app, I didn't consider this book would literally be \\"pocket book\\" size and not the size as my first paper back copy circa 2000 (5 5/16\\" x 8\\") my bad... Inside are his scribbled thoughts and notes here and there on pages. If you didn't read the first Kitchen Confidential, don't mind sticking this portable size book in your pocket, and have keen eye sight, I still would recommend this title.

B00634GHJA|5.0|This little app does exactly what it says it does - transfers photos that area easily selected from your phone to any directory on your PC.  It creates a web server on your phone that you navigate to from your pc and select to upload or download single or multiple pictures.  The pictures and then zipped into a single file which is then sent to (or from) your PC.  It is much handier that say dropbox because selecting the files is so much easier.  I have used it numerous times with nary a problem.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|Some famous albums that have received the remix treatment can come off great. I think about Iggy and the Stooges' \\"Raw Power,\\" which got even more power on the 1997 Iggy remix, and even if there was a fair amount of clipping, it was really an occupational hazard in making the album deservedly heavier. The Beatles' catalog that got an upgrade in 2009 made us rediscover the music all over again, because it all sounded so fresh and vibrant. And Derek and the Dominoes' \\"Layla\\" didn't lose any of its integrity when it got remixed in 1990.<br /><br />Then there are the clunkers. Remember when Ozzy's \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary of a Madman\\" had their drums and bass parts re-recorded? Yeah, I heard a collective \\"Blecch\\" when those came out.<br /><br />This year, it was learned that Bob Ezrin was going to remix \\"Destroyer,\\" which is on my top five list of greatest albums ever made (two other Kiss albums -- \\"Alive!\\" and \\"Kiss\\" -- are on the list, too), and I was apprehensive. Do you really want to tinker with greatness, even if you're one of the greatest producers in rock history? And after 35 years of listening to the same mix, was I going to be disappointed?<br /><br />But I was happy to give this a listen, and I liked what I heard. While it doesn't replace the 1976 classic, it definitely complements it.<br /><br />Here, you'll find significant differences. A lot of things have been cleaned up, little touches and nuances that will become evident to those who have listened to the original \\"Destroyer\\" religiously. They include boosted and/or added vocals from the original sessions (most apparent on the chorus to \\"King of the Night Time World\\"), and more elements that either haven't been noticed or were otherwise buried sonically. On \\"Beth,\\" for instance, you hear more of the acoustic guitar in the intro, and on \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"King of the Night Time World,\\" the vocals seem more layered. Also, on \\"Great Expectations,\\" the part where Gene Simmons sings \\"I'm a million miles away\\" has been fixed.<br /><br />Some things I didn't like, though, such as the \\"You gotta lose your life in Detroit Rock City\\" line that's been added to \\"Detroit Rock City\\" here, and the \\"Get down!\\" line on the final chorus (you heard them on the \\"Double Platinum\\" version, too). An alternate guitar solo is put onto \\"Sweet Pain,\\" and it doesn't have the same fluidity as the Dick Wagner solo on the original mix (that mix is included here as a bonus track). The intro to \\"Flaming Youth\\" has a bit of a tempo gaffe. And the boosted boom in the car crash at the end of \\"DRC\\" really wasn't necessary, as the impact on the original was lurid enough.<br /><br />What's kinda cool here is the restored cover. It was considered too graphic for its time -- the burning city in the background apparently got the brass at the record company antsy -- but is more notable for the members' \\"Alive!\\" costumes, and the \\"blue\\" cover is presented in the booklet so you can compare. (That is, unless you got the MP3 version, which I'd advise against, because Ezrin penned the liner notes; there are rare photos including Ezrin in a top hat and tux with the Kiss members in the studio; and they made the CD look like an actual LP, with the original Casablanca label and both sides of the disc in black.)<br /><br />The thing about Ezrin's productions is that he brings an atmospheric element to them all. Listen to Alice Cooper's \\"Alice Cooper Goes to Hell,\\" and you'll best experience the ominous, doomy vibe that became Ezrin's signature sound. Then there's Lou Reed's \\"Berlin,\\" Peter Gabriel's first album, Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" and even Kiss' ill-fated \\"Music from the Elder,\\" all of which had an ethereal quality to them, an other-worldly vibe that both comforted and scared you. That was especially true of \\"Destroyer,\\" which brought Kiss' image to superhero (maybe even demigod) status based not just on the costumes, but the themes within the music.<br /><br />I think he did this as a labor of love,to go back and say, \\"If I could have had the time to do things a little better, what would I have done?\\" He deserves a pat on the back from me. While it doesn't erase the original from my mind -- nothing ever will -- Ezrin's 2012 remix is something to balance it off, and acts more as something for the die-hard Kiss fan to study and hopefully enjoy.<br /><br />I know there are a lot of folks out there who won't like this version, and that's their right. But keep in mind, a lot of Kiss fans didn't like the original album when it originally came out either, and it grew on them as time went on. (Some could say the same about \\"Music from the Elder,\\" which is less a fiasco in terms of Kisstory but more a curiosity that deserves to be revisited. I leave that for another debate, though.) I'd say give this a listen with an open mind and don't be so quick to judge it by the changes made. It still rocks, and it just might make you want to \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" even louder.to go back and say, \\"If I could have had the time to do things a little better, what would I have done?\\" He deserves a pat on the back from me.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|The story was definitely gripping.  Just when you thougt you had it figured out, it changed.  Very much Twilight zone for me...  Well written, enjoyed the ending.
B001TH16DI|1.0|It's pretty simple really. I won't buy these until they issue the director's cuts on blu ray. It would be nice if they would do both in the same package. Release each movie seperately like they did the dvd versions a few years back, give us the same extras, that's fine, but give us the director's/Tv versions too in high def. That's all I ask.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I totally enjoyed this movie. it was absolute fun. Definitely not \\"War and Peace\\", but come on, people, did you REALLY expect it to be? If so, the problem is yours, not the movie's. No story? Well, we do what some people are terrified of and some are totally excited about - sending out a signal to a possibly inhabited planet. Said signal, as some say will happen, some don't, brings those 'other worlders' to our world. The Navy gets to strut it stuff, the world wins out, the boy gets the girl, and there is your story.<br /><br />Again, no storyline by Dostoyevsky, but hey, what did you expect? It's a summer blockbuster. Get over it. Relax and enjoy, or don't, but come on people. Is it actually necessary to be a total JERK in your review? I am amazed at the number of people these days who rant and rave and scream in reviews, being as nasty as possible, just to hear their own heads rattle. I can understand making considered complaints about a movie, making points about problems with movies or books. I am certainly capable of ranting and raving about something that is important - glorifying child abuse, sexual abuse, etc. But ranting and raving about such ridiculous issues? Come on people, get a life. . .<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about this movie, if you take it in the vein in which it is intended. It is a shoot-em-up alien blockbuster. And, it includes a POSITIVE look at the Navy, which is really cool. Our soldiers put themselves in horrible positions, give up their lives, and we treat them horribly and pay them less than minimum wage for doing it. They deserve to show their stuff. And using those venerable old sailors on the Missouri? Priceless! My dad, a major in the Marines, would have gotten a HUGE kick out of that! I am going to be digging around, seeing if those are Really U.S.S. Missouri veterans. How cool would THAT be?<br /><br />I found the movie well worth watching, especially for this \\"end of the world/asteroid/alien attacks\\" movie buff. Great CGI, lots of big guns, the sailors showing their stuff, what's not to like? A total blast! Besides, Rhianna struts her kick-ass stuff . . . I really didn't care for Hopper, and was a little confused that he was apparently in his late 30's, then went into the military and climbed the ladder even though he was a complete sc**w-up . . . but, well, it was still a LOT of fun, and that is what matters!<br /><br />Take a pill if you are too uptight. Otherwise, pop it in, sit back with popcorn and soda, and enjoy.Great CGI, lots of big guns, the sailors showing their stuff, what's not to like? A total blast!

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I've watched this several times. Wow - Celine is awesome!  I'd never get to a Vegas show so watching this is a real treat. Be sure to watch the other side, as well, because it tracks the making of the front side, giving a behind-the-scenes look. Gave me an even deeper appreciation of this outstanding performer!
0060090367|2.0|After having read \\"The other side of the story\\", which was complex and multidimensional, I assumed all the other books by this author would be similar. Unfortunately, this one was the opposite - very predictable and boring. And the main character was too neurotic for my taste. I still liked the writing style, that's the only reason I finished the book.

B000ID1J40|5.0|This movie is packed with great actors and while its plot isn't exactly brilliant-- the brilliant acting and realistic portrayal of hacking/defense strategies keep it relevant. If you work in IT security or want to work in IT security, you have to watch this, for the street cred if nothing else. But really, its more than just a street cred thing because all the tactics portrayed in this movie (well, most of them-- there are some I might nitpick over) are still mandatory knowledge for IT-sec professionals. Examples right off the top of my head are the man-cage and social engineering.<br /><br />Just watch this movie. It's good for you.
0316287059|5.0|This is the second book by Kevyn Aucoin that I bought through AMAZON. If you look at the front cover it is composed of 2 different people whose makeup by Aucoin fused them into 1 face. This makeup artist was so good that he became the makeup artist to many film stars. His books show him to be not only extremely talented but also very humble. He was a person I would love to have done makeup for me once in my life because I thought so highly of him. This book exemplifies how excellent he was in his profession as the photographs of his work are just beautiful.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I decided to watch this despite kind of hating Kristen Stewart (with the exception of Panic Room) because the visuals in the trailer seemed pretty amazing-- I mean, the Mirror is a gold dripping figure, the contrasts of the snowy forest and the castle on fire, the epic Charlize Theron-bathing-in-milk sequence... just looked like visual candy to me. So I went for it... Yea, it wasn't worth it. You get all the best bits in the trailer-- seriously. The trailer is a better film than the actual movie. Kristen Stewart is predictably awful. You get the feeling Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are kind of trying but their characters are just as flat as the green screen this shit was shot against. So mostly I just felt bad for them.<br /><br />Sucks, because more than once I got the feeling that, at any moment, the writers/directors could have turned it around. There was real potential here. But in the end its just a bunch of fluff. Unsatisfying and kind of boring too.

B006H5120E|5.0|In my opinion, after seeing the movie for the first time last night, and processing it with a more critical eye for most of today, Titanic is one of the finest films ever made (and I don't say that lightly), perhaps second only to Martin Scorsese's \\"Hugo.\\" But Titanic has been praised in many reviews over the years (and put down in a few) so I won't go into much detail here. What I will talk about is this transfer, which is absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />I started collecting blu-rays earlier this year, and I have around 70, ranging from the high-budgeted Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, to more modest films like True Grit and Memento and I can say that, video-wise, Titanic is the clearest blu-ray I have ever seen. The aspect ratio of the blu-ray 3D was changed by James Cameron by using the Super 35 film, which \\"allows more information on the top and bottom of the screen without losing all that much on the sides,\\" making the 3D blu-ray's aspect ratio 1.78:1. Cameron believed this would make for a more immersive 3D experience and it really does look great, but for purists, the traditional aspect ratio is preserved on the 2D disc.<br /><br />This is indeed one of the best blu-rays out there (and judging from other reviews I'm not the only one who thinks so), so if you like Titanic, film history, or are looking for new movies to add to your collection I'd say take the plunge. (I did and I hadn't even seen the thing!)

B009HV2JT8|3.0|Hollywood has just run out of original ideas. Abe lincoln was a great man who i believe this film makes a mockery of.
B000I186FW|5.0|I never get tired of watching this film, and not just because Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are wonderful. It's one part revenge movie, one part politely uprising, one part love story. The story keeps you engaged from start to finish, whether or not you sympathy size with the premise (a re-enactment of Guy Falks day, complete with dynamite and fireworks). Its symbolism was not lost on me, and one could find similarities with the Wall Street protests in 2012. It left me, curiously, with a sense of hope. A great movie!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|A timeless tale with a new spin. I would recommend checking this out. I heard a rumor of  sequel. Dont push it please!
B00A3YTC6Q|2.0|I am a very big fan of the Step Up movies, as is my teen daughter.  If you are too, you will be sorely disappointed by this one.  It has a lot of hype and a boring story line to drag it out, and not enough of anything of much interest in the first half of the movie.  The dance scenes are great (too bad we're not into booty popping, or we might have found it to be more interesting!), but the movie is boring until the dance scenes pick up in the middle of the movie.  Then it picks up and there's more dance to it, and less crappy plot, which gets very predictable, very fast!  The best is the end of the movie and that is where the misleading hype comes in...  If you're a fan of Adam G. Sevani, who plays Moose (we happen to love his character!), don't bother looking for him until the very end of the movie, which is where the best scene of the entire movie is - the dance sequences at the end of this movie are beyond awesome.  However you can probably find them for free to watch on Youtube, so save your money!  Now why did we have to wait til the end of the movie to be really entertained and see all that great dance numbers going on?  Why did all the commercials and hype we saw about this movie lead us to believe Moose was in this movie?  This was the worst of all 4 Step Up movies.  We will not be watching this one again, nor will we be buying it on DVD.  It sucked the big one!  I can't get my daughter to shut up and stop complaining - that's how bad this movie sucked!  The only saving grace was that for some reason we didn't end up seeing this in the theater as we planned to do, so I saved some money... but I still wasted money renting this online.  If this is a sign of what's happened to the Step Up movies, I hope they don't make a fifth one - but if they do, you can bet that I won't be wasting my money on it, whether it's at the theater, or online!  No mas!  Fini!

0064471837|5.0|If you're a fan of addictive young adult literature with strong heroines and lush worlds that will envelop your imagination, look no further. This series is the perfect gift for the reader in your life (or yourself!) who is ready to cast their scopes further from books like the Twilight series. There are some adult themes present, so please use your judgment for a younger reader. I first picked these up at 15, but I don't think these are suited to anyone younger than 10 or so. I highly recommend this series and I can't wait to get my hands on the Clariel follow-up (and I'm 27 now!). #SabrielDay

B0013D8LCW|5.0|Unfortunately there are so few good male love stories leaving us to look at camp or porn to seek stimulation and how to sex guidance.  This story is an example of good cinema that does not trivialize us or deduce us simply to sexual animals without telling the story of our fullness as just another variation of normal social beings trying to work, play and live in loving relationships.  I am so tired of Hollywood and others reducing us to stereotypes or sex centric individuals.  Gay men and women are not socialized with respect to their realities.  We don't have proms, acceptable dating protocols, and ways to help us develop healthily into our gay bodies with other gay men.  We will never get full recognition as normal people until we are accepted as normal on the culture especially movies.  Name 5 great straight romantic  movies.  It's fairly easy.  Name 5 great gay ones and it's impossible.  The homophobes win until the gays in Hollywood and the whole industry provide good material for good actors that shows us no different from straight men and women.  Shelter is tender and realistic and the love between the men is charming.  I recommend this movie.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It works as good as the original which is leaps and bounds better than the chinese knockoffs you can find, but still its rather expensive considering the actual cost to make this. Don't think I should take a star off for good business though, gota fund the next generation somehow ;)

B009AZZEU2|4.0|So, I've been listening to the latest Soundgarden album, \\"King Animal\\" in my car for about two weeks now. I usually give an album at least that much time in my car's CD player before I really decide what I think of it. I've been listening to Soundgarden since 1999 - a band that actually broke up in 1996, and they've been one of my top three favorite band since I was fourteen years old. I did not like Chris Cornell's solo work, and I wasn't all that impressed with the last two albums from AudioSlave. In addition to that, I was extremely dismayed by the single that Soundgarden released for The Avengers, titled, \\"Live To Rise.\\" When I first heard that song, I thought, oh god, it's AudioSlave all over again. Then I heard the first single off this album, and I was just as worried for the album itself when it came out as well. But since I bought the album (not downloaded, I said bought), I have come to really like it quite a bit. I would even go as far as to say I enjoy this album more than Down on The Upside. I don't like it as much as Superunknown, but I doubt that I'll ever like an album as much as Superunknown - the perfect album. King Animal, as Soundgarden stated themselves, picks up right where Down on the Upside left off. It's a great hard rock album. Chris Cornell's vocals, for the most part, sound the best that they have in years. But one can easily hear Cornell's age here. The man is fifty years old now, and has been singing these insane high notes since the 1980s. That takes it's toll on the voice, and in some places, it certainly shows. Cornell struggles in the first three tracks to hit notes that were, at one time, a walk in the park for him. It's wonderful to have Mr. Kim Thayil back on lead guitars. He know when to come in with some awesome leads, when to hold back and let other instruments (including Cornell's vocals) have the spotlight, and he knows when to throw in intriguing little accents; things that just compliment the other instruments in a subtle,but excellent way. Ben Shephard is still just as amazing on the bass as ever, mostly following along with the guitar, but sometimes breaking off into something one would never expect of a bassist. And Matt Cameron is in top form here on the drums. So, all the members of Soundgarden are back - an amazing feat for a band that broke up 16 years ago. Back with some new music that sounds great, for the most part. And even Mr. Adam Casper has returned to produce this album. Casper produced Soundgarden's last album in 1996, Down on the Upside, and the production sound crisp and clean, but not overly so. It's still a hard rock album, and each instrument has it's own place in the mix. Overall, I love this album, but there were a few things that I disliked about it. Before I take it track-by-track, I'll say that I give this album four out of five stars. I recommend it for old Soundgarden fans, and for the new generation trying to find some good music in this sea of bullshit as well.<br /><br />Been Away Too Long (3) - This is the second weakest song on the album. They released this as the first single, and I understand why they did it. It's radio friendly and poppy. It says, hey, it's been sixteen years, but we're back now. And it does what it was meant to do. But, the lyrics are simplistic and say things we already know, and the guitars are stock, boring. The vocals here sound like Cornell is struggling to hit these notes. I disliked this song quite a bit, but I can actually make it through it without skipping it, so I give it three stars.<br /><br />Non-State Actor (4) - This is a pretty good song. It's about Republican obstructionism in the House of Representatives and in the Senate over the last few years. It delivers the message well. It's got a really catchy, but interesting guitar riff that you would hear only from Soundgarden. It's got a pretty cool chorus that gets you singing along after a few listens. But, again, Cornell's vocals here are not in top form. I don'tknow what order they recorded these songs in, but it seems like his voice doesn't warm up until track three. This song gets four stars from me.<br /><br />By Crooked Steps (5) - This is where the album really starts to pick up its pace. Cornell finally seems to find his voice here, and for the first time in sixteen years, they sound like Soundgarden. Looking at the album booklet, we find that this is the first song on the album that was written by all four members. The lyrics are great, the melody is awesome, the guitar riff rocks my face off. The verse riff is very reminiscent of Spoonman from Superunknown. I give this song five stars.<br /><br />A Thousand Days Ago (4) - We hear part of this song in the trailer they released for this album a few months ago. They spliced different songs together to make that thing, and the intro to this song was one of them. The album slows down it's tempo a little bit for this song, but it works very well. It sounds like something that would have fit in well on Down on the Upside. It's got a pretty neat little guitar riff, and the lyrics and vocals are pretty intresting. Good stuff here. Matt Cameron is a master on the drums in this song. Four stars.<br /><br />Blood on the Valley Floor (4.5) - One of the best songs on the album. The guitar part is sludgy and driving. Nice lead embellishments between wails from Cornell. We've got some classic Soundgarden time signature changes, in that way that only Soundgarden seems quite capable of pulling off. Very dark lyrics on this song. I don't think this would have worked well on any previous Soundgarden album. While this song definitely has some classic Soundgarden sounds to it, it is also a sort of new sound for them, and it fits very well here. 4.5 stars for this song.<br /><br />Bones of Birds (3.5) - This was one of the weaker songs on the album. It's pretty slow, and it's very strange, but not really in a good way in either of those two respects. This song's only saving grace is thechorus, which is fantastic. If not for that chorus, I think this would be the first song on this album I would bother to skip. Great chorus, but these lyrics are pretty lame, and it's just so slow. The music and lyrics are both by Chris Cornell, and I've gotta say the stuff on here that is all Cornell just isn't as good as the stuff that was written in collaboration with the other members. 3.5 Stars.<br /><br />Taree (5) - Fantastic song. I love the sound of the guitar. It's a great riff written by Ben Shephard. The lyrics are fantastic, and the vocals sound great here. The melody is fantastic. Great guitar solo from Kim Thayil here, although I do wish I could have had more of it. The song ends with a really neat guitar riff that comes out of nowhere and Cornell just screaming the title of the song. Great stuff. If I were to guess the next single from this album, I would say either this song or By Crooked Steps. I give this song five stars.<br /><br />Attrition (4) - This is a pretty neat song that would have fit quite nicely on Down on the Upside. Really great guitar work on this song. The drums are also fantastic. This is a pretty fast-paced song, and it really grooves along. It's got a pretty cool chorus. It's just kind of a fun song to listen to. I give it four stars.<br /><br />Black Saturday (4.5) - This song starts off a bit slow. I didn't like it at first, but it kind of grew on me pretty quickly. There's some really great harmonies by Cornell here. I like the lyrics. The guitar part is pretty stock for the most part, but then it drops into this really cool thing after the first chorus. It sort of teases with it at first, but then later it make it more of an integral part of the song, and it sounds pretty awesome. Something I found interesting on this song is that it throws these horns in there, which we haven't heard from Soundgarden since Ultramega OK. And they really work very well here. Suddenly, about half way through the song it drops, unexpectedly, into this strange, haunting guitar riff (which is heard on the trailer for this album). Overall, this ends up being a pretty great song. 4.5 stars for this track.<br /><br />Halfway There (1) - I hardly even want to talk about this atrocity of a song. When I first heard it, I thought, what the f#@k is this Chris Cornell song doing on my Soundgarden album? Get this crap off of here. Looking at the booklet for the album, sure enough, music and lyrics by Chris Cornell. Most of these songs were written either right before the band broke up or right after they got back together, but this thing is a Chris Cornell solo song through and through. And it sucks. This is the only song on the album that I thought was filler, and did not need to be here at all. I skip it every time. Awful. One star for this song.<br /><br />Worse Dreams (4.5) - Following the worst song on the album is another one of the best songs here. It begins with an excellent bass line from Shephard with Cornell singing pretty softly over it. Thayil comes in with a bit of embellishment and then is breaks into a fantastic chorus, and a really cool bridge that sort of reminds me of The Doors. This thing is another one that would not have worked on any other Soundgarden album, but fits very nicely here. Great song. I give it 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Eyelid's Mouth (5) - The album ends with two really great tracks. Eyelid's mouth is a Cornell wailer. The vocals are classic Soundgarden here. The guitar riff is really cool. It goes into this chorus that just really grooves along. Another song that works only on this album. And another one that I just really liked a lot. Five stars for this song.<br /><br />Rowing (5) - The best song on the album. The bass riff loops throughout the song with these drums that are very driving and hard. The chorus has some great harmonies. The verse has a great melody and some very showy Cornell vocals. I enjoy the lyrics themselves. Thayil comes in on the third verse with subtle guitar riffs that compliment that trippy bass riff very well. About three quarters through, the guitar comes in full force in such a way that I'm reminded very much of Like Suicide from Superunknown. I'm also very reminded of the songs Applebite and Boot Camp from Down on the Upside with this song. Very strong closing song for the album. I don't even have to think and consider my rating for this song. Five stars; easily.<br /><br />Overall, a great album. I recommend it. Cornell knows his limits in his older age and doesn't even attempt some of the things that he probably would have if he had his Superunknown voice back, but he still sounds great for the most part. The members all know their roles, and the play them very well. It seems like they slid back into this thing easily. Pick it up. Listen to it a few times. Some of these songs will take a little time to grow on you. But, give it a little bit of time, and you surely will not be sorry you spent your 12 bucks.

B005J4VV28|5.0|Son is going through a Beatles kick and I was so happy to find the cartoon on here! Thank you!
0756686970|5.0|We got this for a friend's 7 year old. He loves anything Lego Star Wars. This has all the characters in it plus comes with a little lego character. Very informative and has backgrounds on all the characters. Great graphics as well.
B0025KVLUG|5.0|My son loves this cd so much. It came very quick and as long as he is happy, so am I!
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Tame Impala came up with a record as brilliant as the first. This is the most decent band i have listened to since Arcade Fire times.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This might be the worst book I've ever read. It's the Plan 9 from Outer Space of books. Except that it's not even one of those so-bad-its-funny books. It's not erotic in the slightest. Perhaps it should be read aloud to prisoners, although it may get protested by human rights groups. It's the waterboarding of books.
B00006EXCC|2.0|The quality of Aftermath is out of the question, after all those lame cd versions of the 80's and 90's these gems finally got remastered properly. Amazon sent me the wrong cd though. I had ordered for the late 00's remaster that came in a nice digipak and a certificate but got a much earlier yankee version in jewel case with poor artwork, very disappointing. And you cannot return the cd once you opened it, so be advised on this. My first disappointing purchase over Amazon.
B0050R0XEG|3.0|Great kit. It really captures the Type 2 and the little things that you wouldn't notice unless you see it in a model like this.<br />The directions are horrible and the piece organization sucks. With other Lego models, the items are in numbered bags, so you can work out of 1 or 2 bags.<br />But this model? The pieces can be in one of 10 different bags, most very full.<br /><br />To anyone building, I found it much easier to grab my wife's tupperware and separate by color (ie red in one tupperware, white in another, grey in another, etc etc)
B00AA7O22U|5.0|There is so much comedy in this movie.  You get the cream of the &#34;action heroes&#34; in this film.  The special effects are awesome.  Though you know what's going to happen most of the time, you still can't take your eyes off the screen.  We didn't see it in the theater, and waited for Amazon.  It is worth the price.  We are hoping for an Expendables 3.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|There are different  levels that challenge young kids and then much more difficilt levels for adults. My grandaughter found this app and i became addicted.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Funny and pertinent.  John McGinty, Steven Root and Gary Cole are hilarious.  Jennifer Aniston fits right in. And Ron Livingston is a hoot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Can't wait to read the others!!!!!! So much goes on through the book. It definitely keeps you interested.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|The whole family enjoyed this one. Certainly not a Pixar movie,  but that is okay. It is nice that the ending is everyone wins.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I am very impressed with this fun game. The graphics and game play are really well done, and quite enjoyable.<br />I had a good time solving the puzzles, and finding the objects.<br />The seasons add a great touch to the game, and the concept is fun.<br />I highly recommend this for kids and adults alike.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like this game an its a good game not with a lot of fake blood and that boyish stuff its fun game
B005HSL626|4.0|My kid was playing it as I looked over her,so I found it for my kindle fire for FREE :) . Went to a hotel and they had it in their video game trap (lol) so I saved some coins. u can play off line that's a good thing for my KF.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|If you are a Kelly Clarkson fan, you can't go wrong with this CD. It has all of her hits and a few new songs, too.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|... this is a perfect Christmas album for you.  He still sounds great even after all these years.  I plan to listen to his album after the Christmas holidays.  The other artists featured on the album are a bonus.  Purchasing it with a promotional code was a bonus.  Enjoy!!!
B005GVF95O|5.0|My two year old was easily able to move the pieces around. If needed you can shake the device to move the pieces out of the way or to restart to puzzle.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Easy to get into, and unlike some British spy novels, this one isn't confusing to follow. The ending is jaw-dropping and causes you to reread the book to pick up on the clues. Yes, they all fit.
B009GJCFL8|5.0|2 cd's and a dvd for under 15 bucks.  I saw Asia on this tour and enjoyed it a lot.  I love the fact that they played a wide variety of music from there previous 4 albums together (plus one from Astra).  The material from the debut album always sounds great, but the real highlights are Holy War and Through my veins from Omega, and The Heat Goes on from Alpha......
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Now I honestly want to say the game is great. It certainly looks beautiful, but it is the type of game with still pictures. Which allows them to put better quality images. However, I agree with many other previous reviewers about the hint screen. I have no idea which area is screen 12 at this point. I could have guessed in the beginning. Since I could have stood in screen 1. But which one is screen two? The rooms are side by side for cryin out loud. Even after that the rooms and screens are all around, up down side by side. By then you'll be too busy trying to figure stuff out to keep track of screens anyway.<br /><br />Could be five stars. The writing isn't bad, control of the game isn't terrible. Hint screen is ridiculous.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Loved the movie!  We had seen it but wanted to be able to watch it again.  At this price you couldn't find a better deal.
B0015AARJI|2.0|It worked, but this was a counterfeit controller. I wanted to use this product with my Android tablet and it would not connect via Bluetooth. A legitimate controller worked fine. This controller would be okay if it wasn't the same price as the Sony official one and I wasn't using it for a non-PS3 application.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I used this processor for my first build and it is amazinggggggggggggg!! Seriously 0 problems, easy overclocking even with the stock heatsink, but I do recommend going for an aftermarket cooler
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Great show!  Very gripping and intense.<br />Love it!!<br />Fantastic watching.<br />I watched the whole dang thang in like one freakin' sittin'!!
B0070YDOT8|2.0|I'm deleting it... it's just too complicated... I just want to play... not jump thru hoops. Don't bother, there are waaaay better ones out there
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This story is a must read...it makes you laugh cry and fall in love...I really recommend it.... couldn't stop reading it!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie Reminded me of the a team but more killing & guts everywhere. Great action & acting. Can't wait for 3!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great book. Kept my interest from the first chapter. Does a great Job explaining the culture and landscape of Yemen
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will keep you wanting more and I promise you that you won't get bored. The ending of this book is such a cliff hanger that right after you finish reading this book Mocking jay will be purchased in less than a time's fly
1932100660|5.0|If you have got yourself wondering if you should stop eating meat or any type of diary diet, look no further. This book shows more than relevant and astonishing results that protein consumption has in our lives. A must buy.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It help me every time I needed a dictionary and also gave me the definition I needed every time I used one
B008HT4FUW|5.0|A must see production, can't wait for season 3. Excellent for a Christmas present as well.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|My kids love BTR so this was kind of a no brainer but there are some songs I like on it as well.
0525950079|4.0|Very interesting story that goes on forever.  My only complaint is that it didn't seem like the heroes would ever catch a break.  Completely different from the mini-series, much better.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it requires a bit of patince but very fun and plain awesome. all the ponies go by their fan names ( like dj pon3 and such) but if little kids are playing turn on the option that dosent allow in app purchuses as ( like i did lol) they might accedentaly spend real money on the dlc ( downloadable content)but as a 14 year old pony lover...this game rocks
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love point and click adventure games. This is a really good one. I probably wouldn't buy it, but as the free app of the day, it's awesome. It's pretty simple to figure out, but a lot of the puzzles take enough brain work that it's not boring.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|very interesting and addicting game. the game meets the expectations i had when i purchased it. well worth the money!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just love this game I might even play it every day if I'm not mastikeing and for your informally.
0307887448|3.0|Ready Player One verges on being a great book but settles for being merely \\"meh\\". The author sets up a good plot and an interesting world but lets everything fall apart with overblown and overly descriptive 80s references. There are frequent references to locations or items that are described in excruciating detail once and then thrown away, never to be used again. It's almost as if the author wanted to show off how much he knew about 80s video game and RPG culture in a single work of fiction.<br /><br />On the whole, it's an entertaining story but the author's descriptions get in the way.
B0086700CM|4.0|the only thing I don't like about this game is that it is sort of glitchy on the kindle fire. like I will swipe up and the dude slides down and its kind of frustrating. but other then that its pretty good.
0756405890|5.0|Prepare to be hungry.  I found this book during finals week of my first semester in college and almost failed out.  I just happened to pick it up walking through a book store and the back sounded good so I thought Id relax before studying for my next test.  i then proceeded to do nothing for the next 3 days until I finished it.  This is what fantasy should be.  Ive read all the big names (Jordan, Martin, Butcher, Lynch, etc...) and am always asking what people's favorite book is in the hopes I'll find something new, but so far no one has quite been a Kvothe.  Do yourself a favor and read this book
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Started it in Vienna while taking a river boat trip to Budapest<br />Wow was very insightful to the views in the small and large towns we visited  cannot imagine the times and yet it seemed strange nearly everyone in the book survived it all
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story had several twists and turns with an unpredictable, surprise ending... The ending totally blew me away -I don't know if I was disappointed or just surprised....
B007HACDLK|5.0|The release of a new Rapp novel is both the best and worst thing of the year.  Best, because I know the next 48 to 72 hours will be rife with excitement.  Worst, because after that, I have to wait another year.  I'm glad that the last few Rapp and Reacher novels have been staggered to give a little less time between releases.<br /><br />As for The Last Man, this was another strong effort from Flynn.  I worried about the addition of some characters, but they were handled perfectly, and the story never dragged.  Great stuff, Vince!
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Natalie Portman's on top of it as always as well as Mila Kunis. Laudibly artful portrayal of the ballet dancers' life is a must see!
B003XF1OJK|4.0|When we play a game, we enter an experience like no other. We step into the shoes of a hero (or villain) and embark on an amazing journey that develops into an amazing plot inside a universe we barely comprehend. But what we don't experience is the character. The mystery and wonder of the person always intrigues us. And we dive into that in this book. The Chief has always been an amazing hero. He has destroyed an entire Covenant armada, killed millions of Covenant in his campaign, and stopped a weapon that has threatened our very existence. But I don't want to learn about the Chief, I want to learn about John. The hardships of becoming a Spartan, the burden of his entire team, and the threat he faces as a human. This book makes great connections to him and the universe that amazes me, and makes me want to learn more about John and the amazing universe that surrounds him. I hope that all people who feel like this enjoy the book as much as I did, because you will never get this experience in a game ever.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|very cute and infantile cartoon with a profound meaning and global message. Great animation and original plot make it even more enjoyable
B0063IH60K|3.0|Great app only the winning draw feature stopped working months ago. Otherwise the game is great. The playing field is great and extremely easy on the eyes.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|As a long time fan it is disgusting to have Aerosmith charge extra for \\"bonus\\" tracks that could have fit on the album. The songs on the album are uninventive and lacking the elements that made Aerosmith a great rock group.  Maybe Joe and Steven will start fighting again and we can see some affordable, real rock music when the JPP tours again.  Still savoring that special night at Club Casino from their last tour.
0790729393|1.0|Oh, there's a bunch of angelic little boys just pulling kid pranks on the street...who are destroyed by the big mean adult cruel world. What happened to the man in the subway that they nearly killed with their hooliganism? Weren't they themselves really the original predators here? Oh, of course not. They were little angels with pure spirits sent to a demonic prison run by devil guards. Snooooze....might as well sleep through the movie, is that why its called \\"Sleepers?\\"<br /><br />There is one good prison guard, he just so happens to be black, I guess its the \\"magical negro\\" phenomenon. He stops Kevin Bacon from torturing the precious little boy angel heroes a few times. But overall its them versus the cruel, harsh world...their daddy's beat their mommys, why would they understand the emerging feminism they saw on TV?<br /><br />The one good actor in the movie was their skittish alcoholic lawyer...I forget his name. His cross examination of the female witness in the bar showed something actually believable. The rest of this movie is pretty predictable and dumb.
B002UQIH20|5.0|This vinyl is outstanding. All other raving reviews about this vinyl tell the story. No need to repeat. Do it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Found great music and now have them on my mp3 collection. The only thing stupid about all this it is that you have to put a number of words on the review.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game was so addicting, I played through breakfast and lunch on it, get it.<br />Ps: iron squares can help activate the electric items
B009FXIICK|5.0|Gets harder and faster the more you win makes it so much more challenging for those looking for something to do in their down time (ha ha), great time killer too.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is great fun and easy to play! me and my dad both love it! but the ponies look kinda odd...
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|I'm a play therapist and love the original Creator board game and wanted a newer version, but it's no longer in production so I bought this. I used it with an average 11 year old and we both had a hard time trying to build the objects in the picture. What I liked about the old board game is that the picture card was more of a blueprint to choose the bricks and to build it step by step. This one allows for creative design, but without any suggestions, it was way too challenging.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Engrossing object of obsession. Compelling story, plot, tone, dialog, acting, directing all good. Has better than average technical aspects of cinematic craftsmanship.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|In Australia this series was shown on commercial television with all the attendant shortcomings. By purchasing this DVD we were able to watch this quality production at our leisure and fully appreciate the high production standard.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Only watched the first 10-15 minutes. It quickly became apparent that this is not the type of &#34;entertainment&#34; my wife and I care to watch. Wish I could un-see the image of Tom Cruise's buttocks filling the screen. I was looking forward to this show from the positive comments I had heard about the sound-track. Unfortunately, some of the characters portrayed (at least in the first few minutes) were totally debased. I did not want them in my living-room. Only wish there was some way to get my money back.
B0098460O4|5.0|I had heard Jonathan and Charlotte sing on one of the early morning shows and thought their voices blended so nice together.  This album does not disappoint.  Love it; and hope there will be more albums from them.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|What an ending - cannot wait to find the other titles in the series - love all Gardner books so far and this is no exception
B000FCK65W|5.0|Nothing like the good old classics for late night reading. Very interesting and well worth the money. I could read this over several times.
B006VR65OQ|5.0|VERY good movie and an even better soundtrack - neat that it's based on a true story - not a Pitt fan but he was perfect - lived Jonas as well
B004LUS390|4.0|The overview doesnt tell you about everything, like what does that icon on the top that turns into a mirror image of itself do?  Definitely needs better documentation.  More importantly, you need to allow me to disable the double tap undo feature.  Simply drawing in the left corners caused my entire drawing to delete itself, because the program thought I double tapped.  Now when I start a new drawing, I draw an inch border down the left side to hopefully prevent that from ever happening agajn, but I shouldn't have to do that.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Baldacci always a safe bet and this is not exception - read all of the Camel Clubs and this on is as good if not better
B008518MOW|4.0|It's been about ten years now since the last MIB, and I can't say I was sitting at home thinking - I must have another one.. and yet, here it is, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  If anything, the gap since the last one and subsequent lowering of expectations has helped this one by de-linking it somewhat from the first two.  And that's probably a good thing, since while still a hoot to watch, this certainly has some unfavorable differences from its predecessors.  Primarily, Tommy Lee Jones is missed.  Even in his 5 minutes or so of screen time as K, he doesn't seem exactly `present'.  This is compensated by having Josh Brolin do the best Tommy Lee Jones impression imaginable.. so perhaps I should take a quick moment to explain..<br />This is a time travel story.  Present day, K is dropping hints about great secrets left to be discovered.  K however is wiped out of existence, by an old nemesis escaping from prison, going back in time, and making sure most of K's career never happened.  It's up to J to go back to the 60's and put things right, to save his partner, and almost incidentally, the planet.  So Brolin is the younger K, and really does an outstanding job.  The other missing element however, is the edge - the first two had some genuinely black humor which somehow seems softened round the edges in this one.  Is the director Barry Sonnenfeld getting mellower with age?  I'd like to think so, rather than the alternative, that the writers just got lazier.<br />Those are minor quibbles, only happening because the first two (or at least the first) are much beloved.. but this really does work more than some of the critics would have you believe.  If the time traveling element starts to get a little wrapped up in itself near the end, its ok, because at 106 minutes the pace is fast enough you don't really pause to notice or think about it.  And the heart is provided this time by the new character Griffin, who is certainly likeable in his role as a being who is aware of multiple timelines.  The 60's continues to be a gold mine of humour for cinema.. interacting with characters both real and fictional from the 60's adds a new element that could probably have been mined for more laughs, but gets it just right by not over-egging the pudding.  The `bad guy' Boris the Animal (\\"It's just Boris!\\") fills a required role without being either as menacing or as involving as his predecessors, but does the job.<br />All told - a welcome addition to the MIB series, and even if TLJ is missed, the other elements make this still a solid worthwhile watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Bought it to see what all of the hype was about and new exactly when I was finished - have not read the others yet but am sure to do so
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very easy read that keeps you interested. Good story with well developed characters. Have to read the whole trilogy now.
B000UH8BTK|5.0|I had been shopping around for a copy of BLACK MARKET on CD and I came across this deal from Amazon. I did not have the other 4 either, so what a deal!!( I have them all on vinyl but you can't very well listen to them in a Ford Ranger- at least I can't) The sound of the CDs were great and the packaging was just what was advertised-little mini-lps.. Very happy with this set and the Mahavishnu Orchestra set of the same kind. The Weather Report set highlights the first three bassists of the band so for someone who is just learning of this great music, this set is highly recommended!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always Vince Flynn writes with such great authority and believable fiction with believable facts the story is hard to stop reading.
B008UTV6S8|3.0|I did not get no sense of excitement of playing from watching the musicians on the DVD.(including Simon himself) So I felt the performance was a little &#34;too low key&#34; for me. Recording wise, it was fine and the individual musicians were top-notch ( amazing bass solo!) but boring after a while. I am a big Paul Simon fan but watching this was disappointing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great tale about inner strength and perseverance! A boys survival at sea not only for himself but the responsibility of a tiger. Amazing story telling.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Me, my mother, and my brother got obsessed and VERY competitive with this game...all on my mom's kindle...then I got my own and that made it worse in the GREATEST way ever! It is a good app because you can even get the whole family involved.
B0036OS3F6|5.0|I love these boots because they are so lightweight.  They are comfortable and warm outdoors in the snow.  I just wish Crocs would make 1/2 sizes because they are a little on the large side at the front of the foot. Heel and instep are fine.  I wear an 81/2 and ordered a 9.  I didn't want to return them so I added an insole for better fit.  The 8 would have been too small.
B00A5IYXY6|5.0|I viewed this film as part of a college course on film. It's a truly masterful film, family friendly, with a lovely message, and slower paced. I highly recommended it!
B0081TZETY|5.0|enough electronic swells, bloops, and beeps to feel brooding, with enough indie guitar jangles to not feel &#34;EDM,&#34; whatever the hell that is. check them out.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second novel in the \\"Crossfire\\" series continues with Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross.  If you have read \\"Bared to You\\" you have got to read \\"Reflected in You\\".  Their need for each other was like an addiction, drowning them into an all-consuming flame. Their passion would take them beyond their limits driving them into being obsessed with one another. An emotional ride that will leave you wanting more.I can't get enough of Gideon, being tortured by his past that only his need and control over Eva can soothe the flames of his past but for Eva it's not enough, she needs Gideon to share everything with her and trust her with his past as she has trusted and placed her heart in Gideon. An emotional story that will pull you into their world and will leave you wanting more of them. This is an erotic book with sex scenes that will leave you feeling their passion for one another. I cannot wait for the next book to come out. Read the book you won't be disappointed.
B0026GGCY4|5.0|We aren't in Kansas anymore!  Great album.  Africa has got to be one of the best tracks that Toto ever recorded.

B0086213XW|5.0|This movie  touched my heart because people get hitched too quickly before they even know themselves . When they get married they have high expectations and fall into a rut when it doesn't happen. Bittersweet movie.

B009SQRL4U|5.0|This movie speaks to the kids in all of us.I would definitely recommend it for family viewing night and don't forget the popcorn!
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton has written one of her most fascinating novels.  I could not put it down and I thought I had the story all figured out but Kate is a master of the surprise ending.  A most enjoyable tale...lI recommend it to anyong.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|played through in about an hour's time. decent little point and click style puzzler. reminded me of must and riven.<br />things that could of been better: I wish the hint system would clear out steps you have already completed. so if you choose to use it you don't have to go through each one until you get to the step you are stuck on. I used the hint system as I missed a flower in one of the screens. there are 40 screen and 4 seasons you flip through. the flower only shows on one screen during one season so 120 screens to go through for a small inventory item.<br /><br />other than the hint system and the flower 'puzzle' it was fun little time killer.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've been a fan of the Heroes of Olympus/Percy Jackson series since &#34;The Lightning Thief.&#34;  &#34;The Mark of Athena&#34; is another well-written tale, filled with plenty of mythology for a fan like me. If there is one criticism I have with this particular book, it would be the slight disappointment I have with the relationship between Piper and Jason.  After seeing the progression of the relationship between Percy and Annabeth in the first series, I would have preferred to get more of that character development within the story itself.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Very entertaining, not for the faint of heart.  However, its got a love story element .to keep the lady friend interested

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great bag for a great price, It has multiple different sections created by panels connected by velcro. Its very easy to move the panels around to create varying sizes for lenses, accessories, etc. It is working for me and holds everything securely in its place. Can't beat the price either!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I kinda like it but there's not a lot of fun games... I think you'll like it if you actually try it...
B00A77II0U|5.0|The story line and graphics were awesome.  You get your moneys worth.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had a hard time putting it down once I got started
B0084LQHN6|3.0|Azealia is an interesting artist, very explicit. I'm not really sure what her songs are about besides the usual sex, partying, and being cool. I would like to think that she is fresh and unique but I don't think she's that much different (lyrical wise) from other pop stars. However, I do really appreciate her honesty and &#34;youthful optimism&#34; she gives off in her interviews. I really like  the beats though, I think her music is great for working out but honestly I wouldn't sit around and chill listening to her. However, she is growing on me, and I hope she can put out some cool stuff in the future.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome but one thing it could really use is multiplayer without having to use the same wiring.Other then that its an epic game!
0316069434|3.0|Michael Connelly is so good a writer, than when he comes up with something that is only so-so, it's very disappointing.  He spent close to a third of the book setting up the situation, and then it was pretty clear who did what to whom.  Only the personal stuff -- his relationship with his daughter and a developing relationship with a new woman in his life -- had any of his usual magic.<br /><br />Read almost anything else by him, but pass this one by.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This second book seemed to go 'flat' after all the action in the first book. Disappointed with the ending, too. Will go on to read the 3rd book in the series and will hope for a reason to give it a higher rating.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great app. works great. simple to use. simple to read. and with the free price how can you lose? U can't .

These two have dark pasts that don't want to be left behind. I do so love a tortured soul that climbs out f the much and finds peace.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is very moving. The way it was written, transports you back to Nazi Germany and shows what it was like to live during World War II. The relationship that forms between the girl and the Jew says that even is someone or something is repressed because of the beliefs of one person, it doesn't mean that you have to believe that too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Lots of twists and turns as you slowly are introduced to this very interesting world.<br /><br />I look forward to a movie/mini-series as well.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Ever since I heard that heavy guttural riff of Bored way back in 1995 I have been a huge fan of the Deftones. A band, so cuttinng edge then, and infinitley talented, has once again produced an album that pulls no punches. I am blown away by this newest work of art, not only because it stands alone as yet another incredibly rich and well constructed amalgamation of textures, but also because it meshes so incredibly well with their previous works. This is what gives the Deftones staying power; consistency in style and message while their talents and ambitions evolve into something otherwordly. Now, just be quiet and drive.
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first I had trouble really getting in to the book.  But about a third of the way thru it got me.  Very good author.  Lots of imagine going on in that head!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Great movie which presents current theories into the beginnings of earth that align with ancient alien theories. Also deep religous investigation in a foreign world. Recommend this heavily.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Buy it and you won't be disappointed!<br />It's a great CD produced by an amazing BAND!<br />There's still hope for metal music with FFDP!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This product works great on my Kindle Fire HD.  My only issue is it uses UK english and not US english.  I should have figured this out from the title.
B005IS565S|5.0|I must admit it, FFDP is such an amazing group cause they produced just 3 albums but all of them are excelent, this one in particular is amazing!<br />There's still hope for Metal music if FFDP is there to produce masterpieces!<br />Buy it and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />PS: In less than a year American Capitalist has been certificated GOLD (500'000+).
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great little app.  It lets me see my file structure on the kindel fire HD and it has an easy to use search feature.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love it I think that this game is great. I have never played it before so I didn't know if I would link it but its so much fun and I recamend it to all my friends and family when they ask me if I know eny good games.
1469984202|5.0|I am halfway through the omnibus edition. I struggled for a minute to either give the series a 4 or 5 star, and decided on 5 to give Mr. Howey a benefit of the doubt. I probably have been reading a few too many novels lately and my brain cells haven't caught up yet. He reads all his reviews I've heard ;) I checked the reviews and was putting off purchasing until now based on a couple of reviews, I forgot their names but one woman from Texas said there seemed to be no hope. That is a bunch of drivel. Uprising is in the works.People in the story are fighting for the truth. Another fellow said there that Mr. Howey is too descriptive about objects. This too is drivel. Each author paints a picture and some use more brushstrokes.I didn't like Prip'yat from Mr Kraus as much as I liked Final Dawn.The first is more of a short the last a novel-series but the artistry is still there. I am new to post acopolyptic fiction and my favorite 3 are Howey, Kraus, and Molles. To me the greatest for a good story are believability and that the major characters don't shirk from their courage and become cowards, but expose the truth at all costs. I think there is an interest in this type of fiction because fiction many times parrallels reality. Most question now the truth in what the media says about 911 and how the bankers are spending more and more of our money but our economy gets weaker and weaker, and more of our freedoms are eroded. This questioning of authority and getting at the truth, not the propaganda is what seems parallel in this book of Mr. Howeys. For all you religious fanatics and those who are naive enough to think our government is there to protect us from the cradle to the grave. I too am christian, but read Romans 13 again and pay attention this time. The government is to be obeyed as it says. But the government described is a just government, one that upholds the good citizen and punishes the evildoer.When it does not there are exploits as it says in Revelation. And justly so. Mr Howey is a humble man. He even considers himself a nobody in his questions and answers on his website. I just ask him to not get caught up in his success and become proud, which I think will hurt his writing. I don't think he will but it should nevertheless be mentioned. Pride cometh before a fall. A continued success to you Mr Howey and well done!
B003Y74KCK|5.0|If you're looking for super-ruggedized all around protection, this isn't really the case for you. But if you want a case that makes the phone comfortable to hold, provides decent protection to the corners and sides against dropping it (from a short distance), and makes it MUCH less likely to get dropped, this is perfect.  My biggest complaint about the iPhone 4/4S is how slippery it is. Without a case, or even with most hard cases, the phone slides off my lap or slips out of my hands and lands on the floor all the time. This case has a little drag and is sort of soft, so it is much more easy to hold on to.<br /><br />This is also easy to get off and on the phone, and even though it's soft it doesn't seem to pick up dyes from clothing the way some other cases do. (Otterbox, I'm talking to you.) The price is definitely right! I had paid three times this for a similar case that I loved, so I was glad to find this one. And, it really is an attractive case with the concentric circles on the back.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|You think you know but you have no idea. This story is amazing.  Must read!!!!  Omg five stars for sure!
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|My teenager had wanted to see it because of something she'd seen referring back to it, and I hadn't seen it in 15 years or more. It definitely stands the test of time, and being able to get it &#34;right now&#34; online was perfect.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use on the Kindle Fire and I really like the auotcomplete feature. This is a nice game to relax and wind down the day.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Although I can see this program being fun for preteens or older, this game took too much of my time to play.  I found that quite quickly I quit playing, choosing to play other games that had better instructions.
B001NTUAFC|5.0|One of the best albums that many have never heard of. Nearly every song on it is worth listening to.
0307454568|5.0|Many violent scenes, but full of twists and turns in the intrigue.  I understand they made a movie of part one -- The Girl with the Dragon tattoo -- but I tend not to like movies based on books I enjoyed.
0375507256|2.0|I rarely abandon a book mid read but I could not force myself to get through this one. Absolutely uncompelling and pointless garbage. I can't understand why this book was turned into a movie either.
B00168OIOE|2.0|Digital copy is a joke.  I spent extra money for it and then my computer crashed. When we bought a new one with the exact same apple account, we could not transfer the movie to the new computer. Sine 90% of the viewing of this was on my phone for my son, we got very little value out of this purchase.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing! The story was set in the future, and was realistic. It was not so far-fetched that I couldn't see this happening. It had a perfect mixture of well-developed characters, violence, love, action, suspence, and tragedy. The Hunger Games reinvented my opinion of a good book. Katniss is noble, loyal, resourceful, and witty. Well-written and engaging. If you read only one book this year, make it THIS ONE!!!! A must-read for ages ten to one hundred and ten!
0307949508|5.0|I watched the movies before actually reading the books. The Girl Who Played With Fire was my favorite so I was REALLY looking forward to finally reading it. I'm glad to say that it did not disappoint. I am quite sad now though, since I only have one more book left to read with the wonderful Lisbeth in it. She has definitely become one of my favorite characters.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I bought this item for my son. It arrived quickly and shows very well. My son couldnt wait to watch it on dvd, It shows well..
B003CN4R74|4.0|I used to be a HUGE fan...but with each new album (yes I know officially there's only two not including the new one) the music just seemed to get worse. Origin, while not an official album is my favorite. After hearing the new single \\"What You Want\\" I guessed that just like The Open Door, this new album was going to be a disappointment to me. However, after actually listening to the entire album I am glad to say that I was wrong. Overall I think this new album is better than The Open Door. It doesn't sound as dark or creepy as some would expect but there are still several really good songs. I am not going to do a song by song thing but I will go ahead and mention some thoughts on a few of them. \\"What You Want\\" is my least favorite song on the entire album. The only thing I like about it is the chorus. My current favorite is \\"Oceans\\" which is closely followed by \\"My Heart is Broken\\". Both sound like....well how I expect Evanescence to sound like. The rest of the album is full of songs I would classify as \\"ok...will grow on me\\". So that just means I need to listen to it a few more times...and in the end I am probably going to love it. (Not as much as Origin or Fallen of course.)
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Every other device has access to an update with the December games,  but not the Kindle Fire. I am very disappointed.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|There are books, that when I look at the cover, I just automatically know I'm going to love it. It is a rare thing. After reading The Hunger Games, I found myself in desperate need of more dystopian type novels. I have always loved books set in a messed up yet believable future, but I usually went for those aimed at adults. The Hunger Games woke me to the realization that there are a TON of dystopian teen books...and they are good. Anyways, one of the first books I found after beginning my new search was Delirium by Lauren Oliver. It sounded interesting, and I fell in love with it before even reading it. I had it on my to-get list for almost a year before I was finally able to buy it. Not only did it sound interesting, but the cover was beautiful...and it \\"felt\\" good. I'm sure most bookworms will understand what I mean by that...the pages just felt good. I began to read and did not want to put it down. I forced myself to make it last a full week and a half though and I absolutely loved it. I did not want it to end. Luckily for me, Delirium is just the first in a series, so I have something to look forward to now. I also get to look forward to the movie that there are rumors about.<br />In my opinion, if you liked [[ASIN:B00877R85I The Hunger Games]], [[ASIN:1416911049 Uglies]], or [[ASIN:0385736827 The Forest of Hands and Teeth]], you will enjoy Delirium.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Just get it! One of the best I have played. Creepycool storyline amazing graphics and a killer clown. Worth the money. Well done Alawar!
0439023491|5.0|This is one of those series that causes you to have a moment of panic when you finish a book. An \\"Oh no! I want more!\\" kind of panic. Something I found shocking was that Catching Fire was just as amazing as The Hunger Games...usually the second book in a series tends to either suck...or is just disappointing (at least from my experience).
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Got this for my Husband's Kindle and he loves it. I have one that's kind of &#34;leather-like&#34; but he likes the smooth case.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|if you download a song vid on to mp3 you can listen to music in your imbox on kindle fire it works great but i use it for all my favorite music hope you like it to!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Seems like a collage of several other animated films. It's enjoyable without making history. At last a female heroine who isn't trying to get princed!
B007V65R54|5.0|This book brings a rather basic statistical analysis to everyday problems.  The best contribution is the ongoing discussion of conditional probabilities vs independent events, which makes many everyday problems tractable and illustrates many of the errors expounded on by pundits.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was a fantastic game that had gorgeous graphics and challenging puzzles. It was a great game to pass the time with.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome. An inside look at the unit and mission that took out Osama bin Laden. Considering DEVGRU (SEAL team 6) is a tier 1 unit and is shrouded in secrecy, the book does a good job explaining who these bada**es are. Worth the read if your interested in special operations or tier 1 operators. These guys and Delta are the baddest warriors on the planet.
1401322786|5.0|this book is different from other offerings from this author.  it is a quick and easy read that causes you to think about your own life.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|recomend this game to anyone,everything was great, worth every dime.very cool game every time i played i found something new i missed before,it wasnt borring  at all.grafics was amazing ,sound was realy wow,i got scared a couple of time,very cool
0739368257|5.0|I first read Sabriel in 2000, and since then I have probably re-read it at least 10 times. It is one of my favorite books, and one I recommend to most of my friends (unless they get scared really easily). Nix is able to brilliantly create a terrifying new world, where death is not the worst that can happen to you, and adds a strong young female lead to save the day. Sabriel is a young woman, who when confronted with a problem, no matter how big, she turns and faces it. We need more main characters like her, ones who are strong, brave, and able to make the decisions others shy away from.<br /><br />The main plot of Sabriel is the main character is from a land that is dark and dangerous where magic is used. Her father had been the Abhorsen, a necromancer that binds the dead and keep sthe living safe, but he has disappeared. The only one that can save her father, and possibly the country that she was born in is the 18 year old Sabriel. Helped on the way by Mogget, a bound creature that appears like a white cat, can she master the bells and save the kingdom from a very powerful dead creature.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the audiobook. The whole trilogy is available in the audiobook form and is read by Tim Curry. Curry was an excellent choice and really helps bring Nix's world to life. I usually listen to this at least once a year.<br /> Take a chance and step into a whole new adventure! ^_^

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although, I loved the movie.  The book was incredible and was so much better.  The details in the story is what makes it!
B0091LS07E|4.0|Loved the \\"Adagio\\" intro piece. Very nice piano chords.<br />Nicki Minaj...bleah. Alicia doesn't have the strongest vocals and on several songs I imagined what it would be like if Jill Scott or Beyonce were singing them. Still I enjoyed most of the songs. The last one, \\"Hallelujah\\" was reminiscent of Michael Jackson for some reason. Loved \\"101.\\" Worth checking out for sure.
B0068TLD3A|4.0|There  are a lot of blank pages. I'm not sure if this is how it is supposed to be, but it distracts from the story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So sad when the episodes end.  After starting new seasons it can be tricky to remember all the characters but after watching the first few episodes, it all comes back to you.  Highly recommend!
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|This was a complete waste of time, money, and acting ability. **** SPOILERS*****The story was only halfway thought through.half of a heist, half of a vendetta, some weird love story that won't be understood by most viewers then end it with not one but two idiotic endings one after the other (here is our crappy ending.... haha fooled you,here isthe real ending and its worse then the slop you just saw.)*****There were times when the director could have made something interesting and worth watching, but instead went the complete opposite direction.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|this game is fun but can get boring if you play it a lot because its really just the same levels over and over and over again. but thats justt my opinion.
1557047758|4.0|I NEEDED THIS BOOK FOR CLASS. IT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND ARRIVED ON TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH keep up the good work!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Some of the sounds are great for relaxing, some do not appeal for this purpose.  It REALLY needs a timer, so you can set it to turn off after a limited time.  I find it helpful for onset of sleep, which is all I use it for.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|There is the inherent problem in epics. They never focus much on all of the cast and introduce new characters. Still a interesting cast and story but the pacing is terrible.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Well the gameplay is a massive pile of grind and the important things, like the mane 6, are insanely overpriced. but the story is engaging and wide range of characters make up for it. Just make sure you get a gameloft account and hook up with fellow Bronies, otherwise you'll get stuck.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|The last good novel of the series but here *spoiler* they kill a lot of people here as treachery is abound and people die and come back. But a major plot line with the White walkers is kinda ignored and not talked about in depth.
1453814388|5.0|I always loved the Pollyanna story both the book and the Disney movie where I think many learned the story and then read the book. This book is a \\"rest of the story\\" of all the children Pollyanna grew up with and her aunts and friends. It tells the happy ending and how the \\"glad game\\" became and real part of a community in all they do.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|I originally found this book in my school library over 10 years ago. To this day the book is on my list of best reads. The plot is interesting and dark without being gloomy. I loved it and I don't like depressing dark novels. The book falls somewhere between fantasy and real life, which is my favorite kind of book. I love when books make me feel as though this magical journey could really happen, and Nix has done that. I read this series about ever 3 years or so. It never gets old! Great for 12 and up!
B00AE2I4B6|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, the storyline was interesting (but no real surprises) and the dancing was great to watch, but at times it looked totally computer generated, which was disappointing.  I think most people are going to watch this movie to see the great dancing, but to often than not it looked fake, so I give this movie only a 3.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|did you know this is the best game on earth you should get  it for free.by the way I like pie and ice cream peace out homies
B0083IQFD2|4.0|One of the best new artists of this year, Azealia Banks' &#34;1991&#34; is a great throwback to 90s house music. All four tracks are solid, and a great preview of what's to come with her full-length album early next year.
1616614609|5.0|I'm taken aback by the incredible game design.  There is a lot of strategy and after about three games, you will want to start tinkering with the decks and there are a LOT of customization opportunities.  The game does take awhile to learn.  The instructions are pretty confusing and I almost called it quits, until I did a search on youtube and there is a 45 minute video tutorial on \\"how to play android netrunner\\".  I highly recommend learning by youtube vs reading the instructions.  So there is the barrier to entry in that there is a lot of new game mechanics because the game is so original, but once you learn it, it is A LOT of fun.  More fun than magic, because you have so many different things you can do in a turn, and you feel like you are building up infrastructure to either help you carry out an attack or defend.  You can lay down traps  or bluff.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|My kids really enjoyed it. There were some good comedy in it too. I would recommend this movie to a friend.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I never Review films because it is a matter of taste.<br />But for people who like this type of movie it has<br />everyone and everything.<br />The action is only broken by the humor and at times<br />not even then.
B00632HWOG|1.0|since last update on my mobile the app has gone from not notification alerted, to not sending emails, to where I cannot even OPEN the program! (sanding galaxy s) and as of late, my kindle fire has been not wanting to open the Yahoo mail app. (this is basically my kids &amp; my only life line to my husband 10k miles away, especially if we are not home and with out wifi... please fix.)

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|coin dozer is a good concept and is done with good execution. not too much depth but I enjoy playing.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Even though I am a prolific reader, I don't always care for fantasy books.  This is usually because I find that imagining the world and the rules governing it takes so much attention that it I have a hard time also connecting with the story line.  Sabriel is not one of those books.  The rules governing life and magic in the Old Kingdom are effortlessly intertwined.  The fact that Ancelstierre is somewhat like a partially old fashioned modern Earth country makes it even easier to imagine some alternate universe where we'd need an Abhorsen to keep the dead in death.<br />Sabriel is unique and delightful.  It's better than any normal zombie tale and it has fun horror-esque elements without the unnecessary gore and superfluous fear.<br />I would not recommend this book for anyone younger than 13 because it has darker themes and the dead are scary.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|What do you say about the best movie ever? Ack! Ack! If you like Tim Burton movies,,you'll watch this over and over.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|A wonderful Christmas album! I just love Rod Stewart and this does not disappoint :) Originally purchased the CD then went back for the digital version as well.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie is so funny and it is definitely a movie u are gonna wana make a part of your Christmas family tradition it would be a great movie to watch when you get the relatives together at Christmas.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I normally would have been put off by the overall 3 star rating; however I downloaded a sample.  I didn't even bother to finish the sample before ordering the book, because I was hooked.  I enjoyed this book. It kept me reading.  While it wasn't the most uplifting I've ever read, it certainly was realistic, and I found it to be very well written.  Perhaps because I never read the Harry Potter books, I didn't have expectations.  Initially, I had a little trouble keeping up with the characters, but reading on, they became familiar and I continued reading to see how their individual story-lines would play out.  I had absolutely no trouble reading this book through to the finish.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my  six year old granddaughter loves this ...and the best part is that she's learning to read! she's also learning about time...like how long 1 hour is vs. 4 hours.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I saw Love Actually when it opened in theaters.  I was already a HUGE fan of Notting Hill, and so looked forward to writer Richard Curtis' next film, which turned out to be LA, and with him directing it, too.  I went in with high hopes, and while I did like it, I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't as good as NH.  But that's changed...<br /><br />I still believe Notting Hill is the better of the two film, but with each viewing of this movie I do actually love Love Actually!  Curtis has combined a number of stories of friends, husband, wives, and lovers that crossover into each other, each one with romance and each with laughs, and the first time I saw it I thought he had too many plotpoints.  But now I feel it really works.<br /><br />Curtis, who also wrote Four Weddings and a Funeral and the Black Adder TV series, knows how to deliver a comedy line almost better than anyone else.  And many other lines are quite precious.  Come on, it is impossible to resist a film that has a kid saying to his stepfather, \\"Okay, Dad.  Let's do it.  Let's go get the shit kicked out of us by love.\\"<br /><br />And what a cast!  Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman (The Hobbit), Joanna Page (Stacey in TV series Gavin & Stacey), and other wonderful actors, including two well-played appearances by Curtis veteran Rowan Atkinson.  Also look for January Jones (Mad Men),  Elisha Cuthbert (24), Ivana Milicevic (Bond girl in Casino Royale), Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie), and Claudia Schiffer.  Plus Billy Bob Thornton.<br /><br />Picture quality is very good, a step up from the DVD.  Audio is terrific, and makes full use of speakers in many musical background moments.<br /><br />Extras are carried over from the DVD (in standard definition) and they are quite rich.  There's about 35 minutes in deleted scenes; plus Curtis introducing choices of music for the film; a couple of music videos; a featurette on the making; and a very funny commentary with Curtis, Hugh Grant, and others (Grant makes fun of Firth whenever he shows up on screen).<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  A great film for Christmas viewing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was waiting for minecraft to come out on kindle fire. BEST GAME EVER!!!!! I cant get off of it!
B006GHA9VQ|2.0|Let's start out by saying that I like the Phantom of the Opera films through their various incarnations, even TV hack jobs like The Phantom of Hollywood, and I really enjoyed Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical (whcih I have seen about six times), and the movie made from it...but this sequel, Love Never Dies, is one of those projects where one can't help but wonder, \\"What was Webber thinking?\\"<br /><br />If you are going to move from the Phantom out of Paris, a good place to go would likely be London...but Coney Island?  Could Webber have possibly cheapened the character any more than by taking him from the granduer of the Paris Opera House to an actual freak show on Coney Island?  I don't think so.  And it is in this new setting that the production automatically gets into trouble.  When the Phantom was the single \\"freak\\" in the original musical, he was someone you could sympathize with, though be repelled by physically and for his persona.  Putting him amongst a lot of evil freaks of Coney Island is something that I am sure others besides myself found not only off-putting, but repulsive.  Many of these characters are out of your worst nightmare.<br /><br />And then we come to a plot that really stretches your belief.  First off, that Coney Island is where he would come to and set up shop as the mysterious owner of this carnival, but that Madame Giry and her daughter Meg would not only follow him there but work for him.  And Meg is in love with the Phantom.  Yes, I know, that is going some distance for the original musical's characters.  Then into this ugly land comes Christine and Raoul, believing herself summonded to perform for Oscar Hammerstein. Okay, now, I won't spoil any more of the plot, but where I left off is the \\"point of no return\\" with any possible suspension of our believing in the story.<br /><br />There is one thing I have to say about the production as a whole...it's very sleep-inducing, especially the first part of the second act.  I fell asleep the first two times I tried sitting through it, and only barely made it on the third.<br /><br />Music-wise, I hoped to find at least a few songs that might be nice additions to POTP, but with the slight (and I mean very slight) exception of the title tune, there is nothing here to indicate that Webber had anything to do with the music at all (except for one or two musical passages from the original POTO production that have new lyrics).  You don't come away from this humming any notable tunes.<br /><br />Talent-wise, Ben Lewis makes an adequate Phantom.  Anna O'Burne is a very lovely Christine, and has a beautiful voice to match, which she gets a chance to really use in the second half.<br /><br />Picture quality is excellent, as likewise is the the audio.  I ave no complaints in these departments.<br /><br />The only extra is a 15-minute \\"making of\\" featurette, and while it is supposedly HD, it looks SD.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this as a purchase, even to diehard Phantom musical fans.  You might like to just catch it if it shows up on Netflix or the like, but I can't guarantee you will want to see it all the way through.  (It does have a surprise ending, though, and maybe you will want to stay around for that.)
B0014JLYS8|3.0|Love the comfort with non slip sole, however within a week the nonslip portion of th shoes started peeling off.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Yes, as others have surely stated, it's not going to last forever (does anything really?), but if you're looking for one that's built well, is super-compact and minimizes keychain clutter, then this is the one you're looking for.  I've tried 4 or 5 different keychain adapters like this from different manufacturers (Dane-Elec, SanDisk, and 2 or 3 Chinese varieties from eBay), and none of them stand up as well as this one.  The SanDisk adapter comes in close second, but the Kingston is smaller and more compact, which, despite its smaller size, still allows the micro SD to sit fully flush with the adapter, meaning the card doesn't protrude from the slot (check the photo I took).<br /><br />Buy two or three of them if you're THAT concerned with durability.  At $4 a pop and a two-year warranty, it's not really worth debating over.<br /><br />The shape of the adapter means that it is possible to insert it into a USB port upside-down, but in a worst-case scenario, that's not going to harm anything.  Just unplug it, and re-insert it right-side-up.  Money..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great way to read the Word on the go but there are sometimes some glitches. The glitches don't take away from the overall usefulness.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My therapist recommended this book to me. It is VERY insightful. I would say its a must read for all couples whether struggling or not. I think all the ideas in this book can be used to improve not only romantic relationships, but also with friends, family, and coworkers
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great for fans of horror, both gore and psychological.  Very disturbing in the same way as Nip/Tuck was, though, so view at your own risk.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play it all the time. I love it!!!! Anyone that likes Solitaire will enjoy playing this game! Have had many happy hours playing it.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|As long as you know you're watching a glorified male stripper movie and keep your expectations low, you won't be disappointed.  The dance scenes are great, and the movie has a plot that is very much watchable even when they have their clothes on.  Great for girls get together nights!
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Actors were amazing!  And this book had me so freaked-out at every chapter. Therefore it was a great opportunity for this movie to either be a hit or miss.  Unfortunately this movie was a miss - there was too much time spent watching Eva wash red paint and not enough time building the unsuspecting yet highly intelligent mind behind Kevin, Eva's brilliant career as an author and love of traveling, and the extent of extreme differences (such as cultural) between Eva and her husband, their fierce arguemnts, and how this added to her suffering (they seemed too loving and understanding). There was so much more horror that was missed such as conflicting stories of what really happened to Kevin's sister's eye, the intricacy behind Kevin's final plan, the conversation at that morning's breakfast table, his reign and arrogance at juvie-hall, manipulation of the legal system, his sister's glass eye.  All this would connect when Kevin realized that his bullying tactics would become ineffective when it was time to go to jail as an adult. But most disappointing was when Kevin should have said \\"I'm sorry\\" to his mother at the end when she hugged him -this would have brought everything to a full cirle showing Kevin really loved his mother, and felt remorse for taking away her husband and daughter.  Did anyone else notice this crucial part was missing?  Agreed, unless you read the book, you won't understant what the heck was going on.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This was such a cute cute movie! My 17 month old son never sits and watches anything but he was so entranced in this movie, as well as my husband!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|For what it is I enjoyed this Concert and give it 5 stars, unfortunately my LG BD390 would not read this Blu-ray so I give this Blu-Ray 1 Star for Quality Control, all other Blu-Rays play on the LG, I watched it from my Playstation 3.  Probably gonna send it back for exchange.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|uninstalled the game and now I cant get it back it just keeps telling me to open it and no installation available
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I chose this rating because I like it and it is better than ok. But, I now know why almost every album has such a deceptively high ranking. Need new system Amazon math nerds.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|It is not just an easy to read book, but what I love about it is that it doesn't just describe the problem well - why we have a hard time changing - but actually gives some ideas of how to engage the elephant in ways that is applicable to all situations - bright spots! It is one of those books I will be going back to over and over, re-reading parts or all of it regularly. I have recommended it to everyone I know!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a great free game for people who like to play hidden object games. I also like the added quests in the game and being able to play online with friends.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book is the kind that spoils you for other books.  The story is so rich that it makes you want to go out and plant your own secret garden.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|if I could actually download it! every time I try it didn't download!it just went back and forth with one green bar!
B006JSXYPA|1.0|THis company advertised this as a 3D movie. When I received it it was only a Blu-ray. They told me I would have to ship it back to them to prove it. I was very upset and they are horribel to work with.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book was amazing!! Kind of similar to 50 shades without all the beating!! I already preordered the next one and can't wait till may!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Every Follett book I've read has a quality of self fulfilling providence. Historical foundations help, however, his ability to keep the components together make each read, particularly this one, invite a desire to carry on. So, I will now download Book Two.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I loved the books.  I'm hoping the tv show is half as good.  I hear good things about it though.
B007NWCZR4|5.0|I once collected Pet Shop Boys singles, but gave it up because the price of these imported CDs was rather steep compared to an entire album.  The singles, however, were always worth having because they offered new content, not just rehashes or remixes of songs from their albums.  Eventually I got enough \\"bonus\\" tracks to fill two complete CDs.  Well if you missed the boat and didn't buy the singles back in the day, now is your chance to get these really cool and fun Pet Shop Boys into your music library.  I have often found that some of the \\"bonus\\" songs were better than the some of the album tracks.  If you are a fan of the Bilinqual Album I'm sure you will enjoy the jauntier and much improved \\"Discotecca\\" track--in my opinion this is the version that should have been on the original CD.  This is a must for any Pet Shop Boys fan.  It includes some songs from some singles I was not able to buy because of the expense, making this a great bargain.  I find this collection far superior to their other \\"B\\" collection Retrospective.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|So sad and sweet.  Made me cry.  Hope that I can find that in my lifetime.  Such a beautiful story.
B005GSY23M|5.0|I rarely do reviews, but a soundtrack this evocative deserves kudos. I feel the same way about the Drive film and soundtrack as I do about the Sling Blade film and soundtrack. I knew I was going to buy each the moment I heard the music in their opening scenes. Both films are brilliant, sweeping understatements where music isn't just afterthought but is an integral part of the story...a rare accomplishment. Brian Eno (Roxy Music, U2, DP, Talking Heads...the list goes on) was the genius in charge of the Sling Blade soundtrack. Cliff Martinez is clearly in the same company as Eno with a varied musical background as RHCP drummer and also soundtracks to Traffic, Solaris and many more. Well done, Mr. Martinez.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I like this show so far.  Interesting, intelligent and keeps your attention.  Looking forward to watching the rest of the shows.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|Just saw parts of the concert on AXSTV....Went to Amazon bought 3 cd/DVDs for Christmas presents for friends....loved it....Michael Buble meets Madison Square Gardens.....Ryan's Poppy
B002N7P23I|5.0|I guess the ex ordered this on my account.  Guess I'll have to check it out.  Looks interesting.  Not much else to say.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|You can get behind these people.  When they hurt or laugh or are unsure of themselves you can relate and you care about them. Unlike some shows where you don't care about the charaters, these you do.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Awesome Movie.  Really enjoyed it.  Great quality and streaming from Prime.  Thanks for an awesome service.  Much appreciated!!  Good Stuff.
B0090YHSFC|1.0|I bought this game and played it on the way to a school dance. I deleted it after the first level there is no point. Dont waist your time
0545265355|5.0|She says that her father loved the gift.  I haven't read the series yet.  I have heard great things, can't wait to read it.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I am very happy with my new stylus! I use it with my Apple IPad and the Notability app.  The writing flow is nice and although it is chunky in grip I don't find that problematic.  I also appreciate that it's made in the USA!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I love this.  It's nice to stream through my iPad and use my computer.  Great product would recommend highly.  Thanks for a good thing.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Great show if you're into the zombie genre and good enough to draw you in if you're not. The Walking Dead, however, is not exlcusively blood and gore (although it does a great job excelling on that field). My favorite aspect of the show is the intense inter-personal relationships and actions that the characters are forced into.<br />Entire first season on great quality Blu-Ray and I got it for $12.99 so I have 0 complaints
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I'm watching it for the second time in 12 hours right now.  Great movie.  Great acting.  Great writing.  Love it.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Boring story line. Violent and graphic. Poorly written. I do not recommend it unless you have a sick sense of romance.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love this show.  Always interesting, great writing, awesome cast.  I just love it all the way around.  Great Show.
B009A9BF5G|1.0|Too much rapid cutting completely destroyed this for me.<br />This could have been a fantastic Blu-Ray of a tremendous group, instead I find I just can't watch it for too long. This disc isn't going to get the director any awards.<br />Love the music and will probably listed to the CD, but OMG that video cutting really is brutal!!!<br />I strongly suggest that you check out the videos on YouTube before you purchase.
B00338QENI|4.0|Fascinating information and extremely readable.  This was an eye-opener to me and I thoroughly recommend it.  Who would have thought that a book on cells could be such a page-turner?
B00513DGIO|5.0|David has done what no other author has done quite so well.  He has proven without a shadow of a doubt the lies that currently make up our economy and the valuation of our society.  This is a eye-opening and sobering account of the centuries of lies still being told.  If an alien civilization were to ever find us, they would think we are all insane valuing and motivating our society based on essentially two useless elements of the periodic table; silver and gold.  Add our acceptance of the notion of debt and the economy as Adam Smith described and economists keep espousing, and they would avoid us or write humans off as a lost cause.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I really REALLY like this movie.  It is from the perspective of  a little boy who has special needs.  The movie leaves hints all throughout that Oskar is different.  If you watch the movie through the eyes of Autism Spectrum Disorder, it makes MUCH more sense.<br />It is a very helpful look for parents whose children DO have Asbergers Syndrome to get a glimpse on how they think and are driven.<br />The parents portrayed in this movie are loving and kind, keeping Oskar busy and challenged.<br /><br />I love the twists and turns the movie takes.<br />I thought it was rather brilliant.
B005CRQ3UC|2.0|I mostly do not like this digital edition because it requires you to be connected to the cloud to read it and if your internet is down you are unable to read it on your computer Kindle player. That being said the version on the cloud is nice and looks like the printed book. It needs to be available off the Kindle cloud!!!
0545265355|5.0|I read these books a little while ago and I loved them! This is one of my favorite book series.<br />The only bad thing was the shippment, it took so long to arrive! But the wait was definitely worth it :)
B00480OHWK|4.0|This book is a lovely book and the children in class love it when I read it. It also looks like the printed book and flows nicely digitally so that is good.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I don't know why I have to write more when i already said that I like it. espero que le guste a todos.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|After almost 9 years Testament make this amazing disc.The sound is powerful,Alex and Eric play the guitar as only they know how to do,and Chuck Billy sing whit this guttural and strong voice.The production and mixed of the album is ok,but i think could do better.All the songs are amazing,my favorite:\\"MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE\\" AND \\"F.E.A.R.\\"<br />BUY THIS AND FILLS YOUR HEAD WHIT METAL,YOU WILL NOT REGRET!!!!!!!!
B004I8WD6E|3.0|This iPhone case set is okay.  I find it makes holding the iPhone a lot more uncomfortable in my hand.  It's also kind of an eye sore.  My iPhone 4s looks a lot better with it than without it.  It's also not something that's so hard to hold that it needs special protection against dropping all the time.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I really don't like it because it is probably for someone younger than me.  It seems like I just don't see the point.
0345803485|1.0|I am no prude by any stretch of the imagination, so the review is not based on that. =)<br /><br />This is one of the most poorly written, juvenile fairytale attempt at an adult story involving BDSM that I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to read.  It is completely unbelievable; the characters are fake and too \\"perfect\\"; the damsel in distress rescued by the knight in shining armor is nothing but childish; grabbing the iPod and dancing while she makes breakfast -- oh dear Jesus, how old is this author?<br /><br />Don't waste your time, money, or imagination on this piece of work series.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I never get bored of playing this game and would recommend it to everyone who likes puzzles and wants to play it.
0062073281|5.0|I have read all the other books in the LC series and this one is just as good. I would def recommend.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|When I first listened to the soundtrack I wasn't impressed.  However as I listened to it again and while working I have come to really enjoy the soundtrack.  When I see the movie a second and third time it will be even more important soundtrack for me.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|I liked how she told the story as if she were writing a letter to her sister.  Unexpected twist at the end made me like it even more!
B00062PN6I|4.0|I can always use extra headphones in my home recording studio. I bought these because they were so cheaply priced. I am a singer and used a pair for recording a vocal track. These headphones sound nearly as good as the more expensive ones I use.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I love it.<br />Its cute yet simple and also fresh. It doesnt look like to gody<br />For sure my friends will be jealous!
B00979CS50|5.0|I got more than I exepected as the singig continues to be great, the guitars and beat vintage Neil Young.  Some artists change and not always for the better.  Neil has evolved keeping his style and sound and still hits the mark.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have found it to be relatively accurate especially with the rainfall totals predicted in the 15 day total. It was predicting high rainfall totals for the last week and as held true helping me plan. Great job.
0385738765|5.0|liked the fist book and never really got around to reading the second, so i ordered it for transit on a trip i was taking. Books came just in time and kept me entertained
B002VHI8FE|2.0|This book has one of the best first chapters I've read in some time. Then it goes all hokey. Avoid like the plague if you enjoy the Game of Throne novels. Way to much exposition for my taste.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read this whole book in an afternoon!  It kept me in suspense the whole time, and I never saw the end coming. Great read!
0786956291|2.0|Cards, tokens, dungeon mats? WTF, I checked out of role playing after a few years of AD&D 2nd and found these rules confusing.
B000053VAF|5.0|In perfect condition and arrived quicker than I would have thought.You would probably want it if you enjoy satire adveture and comparitive religion . Rauchous,Ironic and thought-provoking.I loved it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am 1/2 way into the book and hate to put it down Again Ken Follett did it for me
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game. I like evrything about this game. I didn't care that I paid for the third level. My only problem is that I Cant seem to get the hoth update on my kindle. :'(
B002I0J5FG|1.0|These games were amazing for ps2 and I wanted to replay them on my ps3.  Unfortunately there is no option for inverting the controls and that makes this game unplayable.
0810996596|5.0|I quickly thumbed through this book a long time ago in the store but never realized just how much quality it had.  Not only is the book in stunning color-page after page, but the images and collectibles depicted in this book span decades and decades of horror movies and it is just perfect.  Forget who the collection belongs to for a minute because that is the least relevant piece of the book, but the collection is simply amazing and terrifically cataloged and displayed in this book.  You will look at this book again and again.
B005HSL626|1.0|The control is hard. It doesn't even work:( Very hard to work! Don' t get it because it takes forever to download and by the time it doesn't open:)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I got this book at my daughter's recommendation and have not been disappointed.  The story is gripping and the author has successfully put the reader inside the head of each character. I felt the fear, anxiety, anger, despair and hopefulness that permeated this story.  A very good read.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I've been hearing for months about how Lana Del Rey is fake, her new albums is awful, etc. I also tend to read the critic's album reviews before I listen and there were a lot of resentment towards her and her album.<br />I gave this album a go anyways, and I was pleasantly surprised; this is actually a pretty good pop album.<br /><br />Her singing style is actually quite versatile. She can sing low in songs like Video Games; she raps in Off to the Races (album's highlight) and National Anthem; and she can sing in that light, breathy way too.<br />Musically, the production is very polished, very pop, but it sounds really different from the typical pop (i.e. auto tuned ad nauseum David Guetta and Rihanna songs). It almost has that dramatic quality of Florence + the Machine that just really takes you in.<br /><br />One thing that I'd like to point out is that lyric-wise, it gets redundant pretty fast. Pretty much all songs are about her slipping into dress and looking pretty and tragic and reminiscing about fame and bad ex-boyfriends. Two songs stand out though in terms of lyrics: National Anthem is good at poking fun of the celebrity/ money obsessed modern society. Off to the Races seems to be talking about Lolita/femme-fatale like figure that's really intriguing to listen to.<br />In summary, this is a good pop album despite all the backlash (publicly and critically). Musically it's one of the most interesting pop albums of recent years.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Wonderful story line. It had been a few years since reading ut last and it is just as I remember it as a child.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A great game for fans of the Tv series. There are a lot of in series references that fans will enjoy.
0451228375|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors and you can't go wrong reading his novels.  This is the second book of Pillars of the Earth and I loved it so much, that I read it twice.
B008476HBM|5.0|I've always loved this book, from the moment I had to read in high school, and every subsequent reading thereafter. It's the greatest romance ever written, in my humble opinion. Austen is an excellent writer, sprinkling her work with surprisingly profound assertions, and witty one-liners alike. I would recommend to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is perfect for anyone who enjoys a challenge every once in a while. it also relieves stress:) big plus side to it!!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Every one of the Harry Potter movies has been great, and this is no exception.  We've watched this countless times already!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|As usual, Rod does a great job, this time on his first ever Christmas album.  Glad he finally did one!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|like vampire movies and this really came out well..who would have thought lincoln was a vampire hunter great idea for a movie
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  Reading was fast.  Did find that previous reading of her books was necessary for knowledge of the carachters.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|didnt think i would like it, but was talked into seeing it, am now glad that i did, kinda like the running man, but not
030758836X|1.0|I will start off by saying that I LOVED this book.  It was so different and I couldn't stop reading.  Every free moment I had to read more, more, more.  I was telling everyone about it, and how good it was.  But I warned myself, and them, that I hadn't finished it yet.  I read the reviews, good and bad. I was prepared for an interesting ending.  I even formulated different endings in my head wondering how it could end, and if I truly would be upset at varying scenarios.  I was definitely not prepared for the ending.  It was so bad.  Just bad.  That's all I can say.  Over and over.  It felt like the author gave up.  Like she got tired of the story and stopped. I really was hoping for a powerful ending that left me satisfied, that left the characters with the fate they deserved.  But, No.  If I hadn't been reading on my kindle, I may have even thrown the book across the room.  Or used it in the fireplace.
B0083GOVLW|5.0|This movie is truly moving and thought-provoking. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, whether you've read the book/graphic novel or not.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|was a gift to some one as a christmas present , she loves her so im sure she will like it.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|my grandson loves this game he is a lego nut and is enjoying it very much he beats everyone in the house
0761944524|4.0|it was allright, though the professor's instructions where enough. it anything, the cd-rom for review purposes could be worth it..
B009MO57H6|1.0|I loved the other movies.  I loved the video games.  I was so excited when this movie came out.  I went to see it and almost walked out well before it was over.  It was very short, very boring, and recycled the same action as the others.  The graphics sucked.  There were computer programs that looked like the old school DOS.  There were hardly any creatures in it and the ones that were in it, you've seen before.  They used the same moves as before.  It was a regurgitation of the other movies without a plot.  Yawn!  There was no storyline.  And it is set up for another movie!  It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen...  And I love Milla!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is nothing short of AMAZING! I could not put it down. Amazing character development. I felt like I was in the silo myself.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love Temple Run. it is a great and very fun game to play. Its also very very addictive...... GET TEMPLE RUN ITS AWESOME!
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|I usually like to give positive reviews. That said, I'm afraid that there was nothing on this c.d. that was more than mudane. I am very disappointed. I so cheered for her when she was a sensation on Britain's Got Talent. She had this air that anything was possible and you could conquer all odds when the world was against you. I admired her for that. But this, oh I don't know, is just not what I expected. Most of these songs are slow ballads and I was just waiting for her to mix it up, throw in some uptempo songs. However, it seems she is only capable of giving you the same song - only slightly reimagined.<br /><br />I am hoping that her next c.d. will live up to the standards that I know she has within her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really wanted this game because my sister has it on her ipod and it was really super duper fun. so I'm glad its for free and I hope its fun for you.and if you like moshi monsters.com add me my User is katsuma320490 so please add me for moshi monsters.thank you
B007T2XC7A|3.0|Norah is one of my favorite singers, but I can never seem to get fully into her entire albums. I love Good Morning, but nothing after it is has struck me as much. I enjoy the album when it is playing in the background of whatever else I&#34;m doing, but I find mysel only picking a few songs from the album to single out on other occasions. Maybe this one just needs more time. That's not unusual for my relationship with Norah's albums.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Time only makes Susan better and better. I was totally blown away with this album. In particular, her cover of ABBA's The Winner Takes it All was scary good. Her range and tone carried scary similarities to Agnatha's original, though distinctly Susan. Her inflections show true emotion that seem so much more natural now. This is truly a winner for Susan.<br /><br />I am hopeful that Susan will work with a writter to develop some original songs that are all her own. Her covers have been wonderful, but it would be a spectacular gift to fans to hear some songs specifically written for Susan.<br /><br />The duets were a special treat. Music of the Night featuring Michael Crawford with Susan was especially welcome. Michael's voice is so much richer and mellow than I've ever heard. It was a wonderful rendtions. Oh, what a treat it would be to hear Susan and Michael do a complete Phantom CD.<br /><br />Susan's rendtion of Bring Him Home was a suprise. I don't recall ever hearing a female do this song. She does a good job, but not sure why this was selected over so many other Les Mis songs Susan could have really excelled. I would love to hear her do On My Own, A Little Fall of Rain, maybe a full rendition of I Dreamed A Dream, and others.<br /><br />Memory was fabulous. With this song, Susan reaches new heights. Watch out Elaine Paige.<br /><br />All I Ask of You is another wonderful treat - a duet with Donny Osmond. Osmond is quite good. Susan awesome. Again, it would be awesome to hear Susan do a complete Phantom with either Michael or Donny.<br /><br />Susan's rendition of \\"Out Here on My Own\\" is good, but the original with Irene Cara is by far the definitive on this one. A nice listen, but kind of an odd selection in my opinion.<br /><br />This is a must have CD for Susan fans.
B007YQ6SYK|4.0|Love his old soul voice and the organic, retro sound of the songs. Definitely look forward to seeing him live and checking out any future recordings.
B009DJB9HC|2.0|I found nothing good about this cd. the music sounds like they had no direction or purpose. The guitar was good.
B00005JPS6|5.0|as a family we loved the movie. It was a very cute movie. Children watched it so much they wore it out. LOL.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|This is not his best cd but it still good. it a lot of good rock music but i like his blues music better.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Once again, Pixar has delivered; this film captures the essence of childhood storytelling.  This almost makes up for the travesty that was Cars 2.
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie has lots of cool things he fights for his wifes revenge and kill off alot of soldiers starts his own army and fights off england and has a relationship with englands king gay son and at the end dies for freedom.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|i wish i can have this app so i can get to facebook faster and i can get to there better so thats what i want to use when i have this app
B005BCE7FQ|3.0|I'm not a fan of 3D because I have trouble seeing it. But the product was what I expected! And fun to watch.
B009329Y30|3.0|Very hard to believe, but oh well, is a nice quaint love story, cute. Adults viewers only. Teenagers will never get it.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|Light appears to work good. I just took it out of the box, (it didn't come with batteries), and it's nice and bright. It came with 2 mounting options; drywall anchors & screws, or a double-sided stick pad. Obviously, NO thought was put into this. How am I supposed to stick it to something and then change the batteries later? Yes, it has a removable battery cover on the back, but you need access to the back to get it off. Think about it..........<br />I am going to glue a flat fridge magnet to the back, since it is going to be mounted in a metal cabinet. Assuming the light holds up for the long haul, I'd give it 4 stars, but for now, I'm docking it 1 because if they can't get the mounting options right, that doesn't bode well for the rest of it.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|The story is lame, very little dancing, too much bla, bla, lost interest in the movie, only two guys are good looking (Mat B and Channing the rest very ugly!!! :( Adults only (DO NOT recomend.)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Intriguing story lines, beautifully written and acted.  I love the costumes and sets on this show.  A welcome break from reality trash.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|It meet my expectations, is an interesting story, very real stuff in many of the cases, recomend to adults ONLY.
B003Y5H5F6|1.0|Im a huge fan of the series and was sick the other day and watch all 3 of the first movies and then ordered this one.<br /><br />This is just plain terrible. Everything looks super fake, its like they cut the budget to a quarter of what they had on other movies, threw in really awkward camera shots (for the 3D effect in the theaters) and made the lycan look terrible. Michael is in it for about 2 minutes (that I saw since I stopped early) and was another actor. Overall everyone's acting is bad bad. Another thing that bothered me is in the first or second movie she mentions that she has not had the misfortune to have to kill a human (leading me to believe she did not ever want to), but in this one its a human bloodbath the first few minutes. I get that they captured her and they are the enemy but if they had at least made her seem like she didn't WANT to do it, it would have tied it together better.<br /><br />At some point I'm sure Ill finish the movie just to finish, but if you like the first 3 do not ruin it for yourself and just pretend this one never happened.
B007JUWM64|5.0|It is very entertaining, good action, silly fiction, love the costumes, the cast is wonderfull!!! Will recomend to ages 12 and up!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|This movie is entertaining and mostly matches the book.  Quite violent, so not appropriate for children.  Obviously nicely set up for a sequel.
0375423877|5.0|I would rave about this book. Not for the mysteries, for Precious Ramotswe always seems to have them well in hand, even when McCall Smith tries to convince us she is worried about them.<br /><br />No, the reason to read this book is like Dickens, McCall Smith has a voice that burrows into the subject and characters and makes the world he shows us larger than the world we see with our own eyes.<br /><br />The author has a clear grasp of what one should as an accomplished writer. A voice. This may be a genre novel, but the use of words is so clear that you can see Africa in a way you had not expected. You can see the people that Botswana is inhabited with, in a way that you did not think words so succinctly could describe.<br /><br />That is the genius of the style McCall Smith has found. Each step builds to the next, and Precious Ramotswe becomes a loved person that is as good to remember as Tiny Tim, or Huck Finn, or anything Chaucer came up with.<br /><br />This is a must read if you like reading. And thankfully portrays Africa, not as a stereotype, but as a strong continent, with much to offer the rest of the world. (Botswana of course is actually an exemplary nation.)
B009B8YZKS|5.0|As a long time Halo fan, I have been itching for a movie or series like this for years. However, I was not expecting the quality or attention to detail that HUD delivered! The previous live-action short used to advertise Halo 3 was very well done, but it wes, well, short... And the action wasn't exactly excellent. In this series/movie, everything is done extremely well! Attention to detail is superb, from the cut on Laski's lip, to the blisters from his allergy... Some things you may not notice until you've watched several times (like the threat level \\"red\\" that you hear on the radio as the warthog passes by in episode 3 (as cadet Laski salutes the general as he drives by). Everything was done to the highest standards. I'm excited to see what Speilberg (if he's still insterested) will come up with for the movie(s) in the future. As much as I have enjoyed and loved the games, they are somewhat one dimensional and the Halo story/universe is so vast, it really needs some fleshing out. The books are great, but we need more movies/series like this. Happy to see that happening finally.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved it, first movie I've gone to see twice in the theater (in expensive IMAX) twice.<br />So, the take home, able to rewind, pause when I want, repeat... experience of the discs is worth it.
055358202X|2.0|This was a mediocre book, standing by itself. If I put it up against the first two, lets just say its no \\"Empire Strikes Back.\\" I found myself getting dug in to the main character stories and then trudging through second and third tier character chapters so I could get to the main characters again. In some cases, even skipping ahead if I lost patience with the \\"boring parts.\\" ASOS would have probably dissuaded me from continuing the series, if I had to wait another 4 years like those reading them as the books come out. Suffice it to say, I am on the other side of this one and hoping the next one is better.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a topic I am very interested in and have read a lot of the literature about.  This book definitely adds to the subject matter and presents a somewhat new and certainly different perspective to it -- that of a very well educated and highly intelligent man of science and medicine (a practicing neurosurgeon and teacher).  The unique scientific oriented presented by the author allows us to highly value and validate his NDE experience.<br /><br />He is quite convincing in his description of his NDE and how he experienced it.  He takes pains to show how the historic arguments against life after death do not square with what he saw, felt and witnessed and he appears before us as a changed man who simply sees the world very differently than he did before his NDE -- and is utterly convinced that what he experienced is what lies in front of and ahead of us in life.<br /><br />I was impressed with 95% of the book -- and certainly with the power of his NDE experience.  The other 5% that I was more ambivalent about had to do with the religiosity that was implied in what the author experienced.  I have always liked that the prevailing literature describing NDEs casts life beyond ours as imbued with non-judgmental beneficence -- not religious oriented.  The author, in my thinking, incorporated too much of the religiosity to make this a five star review for me.<br /><br />No question this is both a terrific read and a real contribution to NDE literature.  The author is well spoken and he has written a book which anyone can easily follow.  Very, very good.  Definitely worth while!
B005LAIHRC|5.0|This movie is awesome! It is loaded with so much star power it is unreal, Cruise, Zeta-Jones, Brand and plenty more, and one can't forget about the rocker cameos!<br /><br />I have never seen the musical, but if it is anything like the movie, it has got to be an amazing experience. The songs flow so well within the movie, and just about every 80s mega hit is here, from We're not gonna take it, to Every rose has its thorns. You will find yourself singing along and playing air guitar more than once!<br /><br />The story and acting were both top notch. Its rock and roll, with a little love story threw in, and some comedy to top it off. I believe this movie will turn out to be this generations Grease.<br /><br />So what are you waiting on, order this movie and rock out like its 1980! Enjoy and hope this review helped out.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I've been a fan of Alicia Keys from the beginning.  While admittedly a fan, I can't say that I've always enjoyed each offering from beginning to end on her previous 4 releases.  Call it musical taste, but I always find highlights of greatness and then not quite to my taste, but still a fan nonetheless and have and will buy an Alicia Keys album without hesitation.<br /><br />Case in point, The Element of Freedom.  Kind of underwhelmed with the exception of a couple songs Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart and my absolute favorite Unthinkable (I'm Ready).  And I must admit, I felt it would be the same with Girl on Fire.  Actually, I felt that I would be bored with most of the release only appreciating a few songs like I have in the past.  But I gotta say, this is my first Alicia Keys album that I can listen to all the way through and really appreciate each song.  Kudos to Alicia Keys.<br /><br />If you like drums and bass, this is the cd for you.  I realized how much I enjoy drums and bass.  Standouts tracks and my favorites thus far \\"When its all over\\", \\"Brand New Me\\", \\"New Day\\", \\"Girl on Fire\\", which by the way, I am personally happy that the inferno version is offered (despite Nicki Minaj) and not the slowed down version where I actually couldn't believe she'd release such an unfinished vocal.  The inferno version truly captures the intent behind the title.  One reviewer on amazon said something that struck me and its simple.  This is a cd that you have to listen to with your heart, and listen to the lyrics.  I found myself myself appreciating this offering for what it is for Alicia.  There are a number of songs, \\"101\\" especially, that if you listen, has to be about her media driven controversial relationship with Swizz.  Very interesting if you listen to it. \\"Brand New Me\\" at first listen you'd think why is this the first song on the cd.  Toward the end of this song, at least for me, it made sense why this song was in the beginning.  It was as if she was saying \\"I have something to get off my chest and now we can move on\\".  I especially welcomed tempo change toward the end of this song, where you hear the declaration that it is a \\"Brand New Me\\".  As I'm listening I'm saying, Alicia, I got it.  I get where you are coming from.  I'll close with this, this is a cd that you have to listen to not just with your mind, but with your heart.  And maybe it is listening with my heart that I've been missing on past releases.
030758836X|1.0|Let me start by saying that I love mysteries and have probably read a few hundred of them over the years. With all the praise for Gone Girl, and its best-seller status, I had high hopes for this book. I actually hated it. I don't understand how it became, or stays, a best seller.  I found the story contrived, the characters extremely unlikable, and the writing amateurish. In addition, I found factual and grammatical errors, which leads me to think the author was careless, or worse. I am sorry that I can't be in any way positive about this book, but it was an unpleasant waste of time and money for me.  Perhaps I started with the worst first, but even if that is the case,  I certainly won't read another of her books.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|...but not as good as any of those movies.  More androids working for evil corporations, acid-spewing monsters and flame throwers.  Give it up Ridley...or go work for SyFy channel cause this is nothing more than a high-budget made-for-tv scifi channel movie.  If you like those movies, you'll love this.  But for me it was totally un-scary...except for the disgusting surgery scene.  (Scott at his best.)  The rest is pretty predictable, yet well filmed.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My 3 daughters like this show. It's a touching story but I really like the graphics...it looks all warm and cuddly.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I'll admit I'm biased - I read all the comic books growing up, so was already a huge fan.<br />But this movie is really good - has all the necessary elements:  great special effects, good storyline, very good characterization...all in all, a great story and a fun way to spend a couple of hours.<br />Probably better than some that have gone before (Iron Man, the new Spiderman, etc.)
B007HACDLK|5.0|It is always nice to have a book you can not put down.  Vince Flynn always delivers and this one does it again.  Now waiting for the next.
B00913DPW2|4.0|Tough and challenging, with just enough in the way of hints and support.<br />Better than other similar games I've played in the past.
034580404X|3.0|There was an interesting, underlying story that kept me reading.  However, the constant repetitive sexual episodes became irritating and I just wished for the story to continue. Unbelievable that any time the two saw each other they were overcome by an overwhelming sexual need. Less sex would have made it more stimulating by anticipation, I think.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hats this game the facebook thing pops up without me pressing it I play someone then it freezes I hate it!

B0086DBE62|5.0|The movie was much better than I thought it would be! Great family fun, and the quality was really great through Amazon. I love that all the dwarves were REAL dwarf actors! Great job, they made the movie!
B001T3RA8M|5.0|Sabriel is a book I have owned since middle school and have read and reread even as an adult today. It has action, romance, mystery, and suspense, all on the canvas of an alternate universe that is foreign, yet evokes connections to Pre-WWII Great Britain and a kingdom woven with magic. Sabriel herself is a fierce heroine, embodying loyalty, bravery and sincerity while struggling with making her way in the world. I cannot recommend this book enough!<br /><br />P.S. If any of you know anyone in the movie industry, I am DYING for this series to be made into a movie (not to ruin it, but rather to make sure EVERYONE knows how awesome Garth Nix's writing is!).
B004IWF64Q|4.0|Very good second movie. This was our first time seeing it and we very much enjoyed the quality and the story line. A little interesting ending for a princess movie but they can't all be the same I guess.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I now buy copies for my team members and am always telling everyone about this.<br />This is a must for every person who wants to make themselves better people and improve their life.

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|this game is ok, just didn't like waiting 3 minutes for one point of energy to do<br />anything. the graphics were nice and it was interesting going prospecting for gold.<br />this game also has you make purchases with real money and that was disappointing. once you pay for a game you shouldn't have to pay more to play it.<br />there are other games more fun than this one.
B000G6BM00|5.0|Best Sequel ever in my opinion. It took many years later for Alien 2 or as it was labeled Aliens to come out, but the wait was worth it.<br />Doug

B003PBB4ME|2.0|My use for the X-Grip was with a Canon 60D shooting a long form video with at least one additional shotgun mic on a run & gun project. But once I added the extended battery adapter to the camera the Optika isn't tall enough to accommodate it. Even without, the balance is poor if you use a longer lens. It is best used with a lightweight pancake lens, no added battery & no peripherals attached. Don't expect better balance or improved stability/steadier movement; it it a handle at best - one that wiggles. It is a nice alternative to using a hi hat on the ground if you don't mind leveling the shot with your keys. And it does mount onto a tripod plate for a quick transition from a master shot to hand-held. If it is going to be used for ammeter video it is probably fine for the price.

B00138GY5I|5.0|If you're just hearing about Cake now, or been a long time fan, I think you'll be hard pressed to find another album from them with so many great songs.  They don't take themselves seriously, and I that's what I like about this album.  They have a good time, do what they like, and don't worry about making their lyrics too meaningful.  Experimentation with words, instruments, and harmonies are seen throughout the album.<br /><br />In regards to the individual tracks:<br /><br />1: Frank Sinatra - 4/5 - With it's slower pace, this song relaxes the nerves and sounds smooth, just like Ol' Blue Eyes.  Describing this song in one word: Entrancing<br />2: The Distance - 5/5 - Yes, this is the most popular song on the album, but deservedly so.  The change of pace throughout the song helps build the anticipation of finishing the race, and for me, brings back memories of high school.<br />3: Friend Is A Four Letter Word - 2/5 - One of my least favorite songs, maybe it's because I feel the trumpets are too repetitive.  Not an awful song, just not a great song.<br />4: Open Book - 4/5 - The song feels like a dark warning, but I love the harmonies and, again, the change of pace between the chorus and verses.<br />5: Daria - 3/5 - Very lighthearted kind of song, even if the topic is about denying the advances of a woman.  It's one I end up looking for in my playlist during long drives.  Easy to sing along to and laugh at with some of the lyrics that<br />6: Race Car Ya-Yas - 2/5 - Again, too much of the horn in this one.  Feels completely disjointed and out of rhythm.  I don't even have it on my music player because I always skip it.<br />7: I Will Survive - 5/5 - A fun cover of a well known song.  They put a nice touch on this, especially with the drums.  I feel it's almost a message to the music industry that they'll make things the way they see fit, and they're fine with the results of their musical creativity, good or bad.<br />8: Stickshifts And Safetybelts - 5/5 - Very upbeat, great harmonies, and a must for long road trips.  The song creates the very vivid image of a couple trying to be as close as they can during any moment in their car.  Great lyrics and it's hard to get out of your head once you hear it.<br />9: Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps - 3/5 - It's catchy, and I love the message throughout the verses, but I think the chorus could have used a little more.  I still love the song, but find it something I only want in small doses.<br />10: It's Coming Down - 2/5 - Not much creativity to this one, as it's pretty much the same line over and over.  I do like the instruments, but the lyrics to this one are very lacking.<br />11: Nugget - 3/5 - Lots of explicit lyrics here, but it's funny and I can't help but smile while listening.  It's so crazy, you can't take anything said in the song seriously.  &#34;Like sharpened knives through chicken McNuggets&#34;... Who comes up with this!?<br />12: She'll Come Back To Me - 3/5 - An average song, but a depressing message.  Definitely conveys the message that he's longing for his love, but not as creative as I was hoping for with such a message.<br />13: Italian Leather Sofa - 5/5 - The harmonies, ridiculous lyrics, and pace of this song just go well together.  The horns bring a nice touch to the song.<br />14: Sad Songs And Waltzes - 4/5 - Great closing song to the album, with slow pace is a nice way to &#34;sign off&#34; until the next time you listen to a Cake album.<br /><br />I owned this as a CD in high school, but couldn't find the disk a few months ago.  Browsing through my backup, I only found a few of the songs, so I knew I had to buy the album.  Amazon is my &#34;go to&#34; place for music purchases, and making the transaction was a piece of &#34;Cake&#34;.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I decided to read the book, after seeing the movie. I enjoyed the movie but totally fell in love with the book. What great story telling. If you have the slight interest in religion, curiosity of the meaning of life or just enjoy great story telling, this book is a must read.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|It's hard to pull off a 30 song album. This dude does it. :-) Listening to it is like an experience. It draws you in, and its made to just sit back and vibe with; clearly an intent in its creation, with an emphasis on art, instead of conforming to the tastes of the masses :-)
B007EE564U|4.0|This book lives up to his usual style. Fast paced, action packed and with some unexpected plot twists.  Would recommend it.
0811879542|4.0|I bought this book after a bookstore employee recommended it to me.  It is really great.  Each page has instructions and then when you turn the page, you have caused something to happen.  For example, you tap gently on a yellow dot 5 times, when you turn the page, there are 5 yellow dots.  The entire book is the circles/dots and some text.  They look painted, which I really liked (you can see brush strokes).  I have twin 2.5 year old girls and they really like it.  They love rubbing and tapping the dots.  They particularly like the parts when you shake the book.  They, of course, believe they have caused the changes in the book.  They think it is great.  It is an expensive book, but it is creative and my kids really like it, so I am very pleased with it. The outside is a board book material.  The inside pages aren't a true board book material, but they are a thicker, glossy type page.  I highly recommend it!<br /><br />I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because it is too pricey for a kid's book in my opinion.  Amazon's price is a good discount off the cover (or at least it was when i bought the book).

B000U0O9FM|3.0|I shouldn't have waited until middle-age to read this. I picked it up on the advice of a friend, and I should have loved it. Instead I found it creepy and disturbing. I had the same experience with the Dune movie and with Hunter Thompson's &#34;Hell's Angels&#34;. Loved them in my teens and early 20's, hated them later. Apparently, some things have a very strict demographic. I don't recommend against this book, just know what you're in for.

B001NFRA90|5.0|For those of you fortunate enough to witness the live collaboration of guitar extraordinaire Marc Bonilla with friends Keith Emerson and Glenn Hughes, you will know that these recordings have been rumored to have existed for a very long time. Well, it is a rumor no more as this all star line up affectionately know as the Boys Club has finally seen the light of day. Chronicling a few live California dates back in 1998, Live From California encapsulates the magical moments of these three brilliant musicians on stage.<br /><br />While for many, Emerson and Hughes will be the marquee players, this album is anchored by the utterly underrated and underexposed Marc Bonilla who released two fabulous solo albums back in 1991 and 1993. To this day they remain probably the best instrumental electric guitar albums of all times. With Keith Emerson making an appearance on Bonilla's debut EE Ticket courtesy of the song \\"White Noise\\" and then Hughes on the follow up American Matador on the entirely breathtaking rendition of \\"A Whiter Shade Of Pale\\", relationships had already been established. Three years later, Bonilla collaborated on Glenn Hughes solo album Addiction, while Bonilla has been playing live with Emerson since 2006. This ultimately progressed to last year's ambitious studio recording under the Keith Emerson Band featuring Marc Bonilla.<br /><br />But let's turn back the clocks over a decade and take a look at Live From California that features the three amigos, as well as Bonilla's impressive band affectionately know as the Dragonchoir. Prior to this live recording, Bonilla appeared at Billboard Live also known as The Key Club which is relatively small but one of the most efficient venue back in its heyday. That particular concert also included the surprise appearance of not only the three amigos but also Ronnie Montrose. Whether there were any high quality recordings of this particular concert captured still remains to be heard but had it been captured here it would have been the quintessential recording to fully represent the live dates of California on what is already close to absolute perfection.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the 68 minutes of live material that also includes the impressive studio collaboration \\"Middle Of A Dream\\" is an utter sonic delight of musician perfection. The album opens with Bonilla's solo track \\"Afterburner\\" that outright sizzles and places you on immediate notice that you are in for a wild ride of utter rock n' roll. Accompanied by the duel guitar work of Mike Wallace the music is tight and spellbinding. The album immediately changes pace with the more ambient \\"Long Journey Home\\" where it is Bonilla on his Ebow guitar downright weeping music tears mixed in a light wash of Ed Roth's keyboards. While it is a wonderful song in and of itself it acts as a prelude to the introduction of Keith Emerson's stage entrance as the song migrates into a brilliant rendition of Emerson Lake and Palmer's \\"Hoedown\\". The Emerson Lake & Palmer catalog is revisited later with the 19 minute mother lode \\"Tarkus\\" hammered out. However, instrumentally the band is at its best with their rip-roaring sampling of the Nutcracker courtesy of their playful and dizzy performance of \\"Nutrocker\\" that is so magical and transforming that it will have you believing that it could snow in the middle of the Sahara. The band is also spot on with the execution of Bonilla's composition \\"White Noise\\".<br /><br />However, let's not forget the powerful Glenn Hughes who arrives on stage on track four to present the audience with his awesome vocal rendition of \\"A Whiter Shade Of Pale\\". With Bonilla's guitar taking over the lead parts that were originally written for the keyboards, the duo and the entire band for that matter, breathe new life into this stellar Procol Harum classic. Those of you who have had the privilege to hear Bonilla's studio rendition will be happy to know that both the guitarist and the Voice of Rock are totally capable of reigniting their magic live. Hughes is also prominent when the Boys Club's perform his mid-tempo moody rocker \\"Cover Me\\" from the Addiction album, as he is on the band's interpretation of the Allman Brother's song \\"Dreams\\" all done with the powerful funk that we have come to expect from Glenn.<br /><br />For those of us that managed to miss this low profile magical moment, Live From California, you will not be disappointed. The production, energy and brilliant live performances have finally been etched for eternity via this official release. Run don't walk to purchase this silver disc and slip it into your hi fi player of choice. Then close your eyes and let Bonilla, Emerson and Hughes take you to musical heaven. Your rock and roll spirit will truly soar!ng their magic live.

1451627297|3.0|Somehow I'd never read a Stephen King novel before. This one is an exciting, plot-driven page-turner, but in retrospect was not entirely satisfying; the end, in particular, is clich&eacute; and predictable.<br /><br />The premise: Jake Epping, high school English teacher and aspiring novelist, is recruited by a dying acquaintance, Al, who has a portal to 1958 in his pantry. Al has made stopping the Kennedy assassination his life's work, and Jake agrees to take over for him, although it means spending years in the past.<br /><br />Plot is this book's greatest strength; although it's over 840 pages long, it kept me enthralled throughout. Each of the six sections has its own rising action and climax, and there's some truly heart-pounding action. The time-travel setup is interesting and well-thought-out, resulting in a sensible plot with almost no holes, a rarity for a time-travel book. I didn't begin the book with any particular interest in the historical events around which it revolves, but King does an excellent job in weaving the history into the novel in an engaging way; I had even less interest in Oswald trivia, but Oswald and his family and associates are actually the book's most vivid and lifelike characters.<br /><br />Which is unfortunate, since 11/22/63 is really about Jake, not Oswald or Kennedy. Jake reads like an authorial self-insert, and while his voice rings true, his mission is far more interesting than he is. I found myself rooting for him because he's the hero, but as a character, he's on the bland side. His love interest, Sadie, is worse: your typical action-story girlfriend, who's called brave loudly and often but who always comes down with a case of damsel-in-distress at the worst moment. (This book has more than its share of distressed damsels, and men rescuing or \\"avenging\\" them.) Many reviewers have loved their romance, which occupies a large chunk of the book, but while I didn't actively dislike it, I never saw any particular reason for these two characters to be together or got invested in their story.<br /><br />The settings are vividly drawn; King uses detail well to build atmosphere, and the Derry section in particular is creepy. The historical period comes vibrantly to life, rich with sensory detail, and Jake's culture shock in the \\"Land of Ago\\" is consistently entertaining. He does at times get off easily, though; Jake's 35 when he travels to 1958, which would have made him part of the generation that came of age during World War II, but somehow no one ever asks him about his war service or references any of the shared culture from the period that he missed. Additionally, for all the talk of cigarette smoke everywhere, King's rendering of the times is quite nostalgic. Racism is barely mentioned; Jake sees one whites-only restroom and hears a couple of racist rants, but we never see an actual person affected by segregation or hatred.<br /><br />Despite everything, this book is just so enjoyable that up until the last 100 pages, I expected to give 4 stars. Admittedly, reaction to the ending is a matter of personal taste:  I am not a science fiction reader and am far more interested in the potential alternate history than the effects of time travel on the space-time continuum. I also find moralizing about changing the past uninteresting, since time travel is purely fantasy anyway. Throughout the book, I suspected King would end it as he did and hoped I was wrong--sadly, I wasn't.<br /><br />Thus, my final reaction is mixed. Despite its length, the book maintains suspense and tension throughout. And readers who enjoy science fictional elements more than I do are likely to appreciate the finale. As a historical thriller, the book is not perfect, but it is a lot of fun.aracters to be together or got invested in their story.<br /><br />The settings are vividly drawn; King uses detail well to build atmosphere, and the Derry section in particular is creepy.

B009CPJHY4|2.0|I had read about this movie and from what I read I thought it would have been<br />a really good mother/daughter movie.  Well!  I watched over half of it<br />and had to turn it off.  I can't believe that a producer or director<br />not to speak of the really good actors would have taken part any this endeavor.<br />I wasted my money.
B003L77G06|5.0|You won't regret buying this season. Gave it as a gift to mom and she loved it. Endless laughter all in a few DVDs. Fast shipping and worth your pennies.
B000FBFM9S|4.0|Zadie Smith's White Teeth is an exposition in how to convey impressive dialog without seeming contrived.  The characters seem unbelievably human despite their imprints on the page; it isn't as if mere moments are defining but entire spans.  You may well find yourself shaking your head after a headlong rush through the novel- in a good way.  Thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommended.
0345803485|1.0|I don't understand how this made the best seller list and got movie rights. It's repetitive and not very interesting. She falls in love with him over a two week period and does nothing but cry, blush and bite her lip. It just wasn't for me and I wish I didn't waste my money.

B004HSMF2M|5.0|Hitler must ultimately decide what threats are real and when.  He relies on the one man he knows can accomplish the task of finding out the truth.  So he sends to England \\"The Needle\\" a deep cover spy who is so confident that he does not let the intermediate folk get in his way. Any that do do not live to tell about it.<br /><br />First, they have to believe that he actually exists.  Then they have to find him.  It they can find him, can they stop him?<br /><br />Yes, the story is intriguing.  Yet it is the people interaction (loyalty, love, and credibility) and the attitude of \\"The Needle\\" that make the story.  Ultimately, the question is \\"Will he succeed and what effect will this have on future generations of those who knew him?\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000035P5E Eye of the Needle]]
1451613512|5.0|Similar to Zinn's People's History of the US,<br />but focussed on 20th and 21st century. Will reinforce<br />your dim views of US militarism and capitalist<br />greed. Of course if those things don't trouble you,<br />then you better stay away...
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Fabulous under the radar movie. Great mix of science fiction and nordic history. Good story, good action and overall fun. Sorry I missed this at the theater.

B009NPM5Y2|5.0|I don't see any Academy Awards in this films future but it was fun and very entertaining. The music was a great. Tom Cruise' character was creepy and some of the kissing in this movie was oddly uncomfortable and again creepy creating uneasy chuckles but overall a movie I would recommend to friends and family.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has more than 101 games and the games are hard but fun to play all day I cant keep myself from playing it. Awesome! !!! :)  ;) =) &lt;3
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator app!  It has nice, big buttons that make it easy to use and keep mistakes to a minimum.  It also has nice advanced features that I will rarely use, but it is great to have them if I need them.  I like that those features slide out of the way so the basic calculator is clean and clear.
B006VGGAC4|3.0|I was really into this book up until he became governor.  The book was very interesting, and although it was obvious his ego was on display, I was still impressed with he true to life American Dream existence.  However, when he became governor, the book devolved into a check book of accomplishments that was far too detailed to be of anyone's interest unless they were looking as source material for a vetting.  I have always liked and admired Arnold and this book didn't change that opinion at all.  It struck me as very honest despite it's ego stroking.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|very riveting story. very good valu for the price. j am probably a fan o hugh's work now.<br />wool i not a sci fi bu more bout humans and what they do during desparsre times.
B00AE6SS5O|1.0|this game is awful the cover does not have anything to do with the game the price is should be free
0061474355|5.0|I read this book the first time when I was 14, and it really changed my life. To this day (I'm 24)whenever I feel a bit down or restless or trapped or anything I pick up the Sabriel trilogy. I truly love this series, even my dog is named for the second book: Lirael. [[ASIN:B001T3RA8M Sabriel]]
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|Great clean family movie, I would highly recomend for anyone. I give it five stars because I think anyone could watch it and get something out of it.
B002ZG999U|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed the movie very much! We didn't want to see #2 without seeing #1 and am glad we did.
B003XU02QG|1.0|The story was predictable and simple.  It could have been written by middle school kids.  Pointless is the best single word for this waste of film.  Average acting and above average blood splatter are the highest and best praise possible for this slasher want-to-be.  Really, don't waste a moment of life on this.  Reruns of the A Team are better than this useless dribble.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I absolutely loved the app until it stopped working on my kindle fire! And I was on the last level it really bugged me. I would've given it five stars if it kept working.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Awesome writer. Equal to a Clancy and Hunter story. I have read them all.<br />Wish he wrote a book a month, finished it in two evenings. It is like reading<br />what is going on today in our country.<br /><br />LAH

B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is great, I can't help but to read it over and over again, and I hope that it will transfix you in the same way.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I loved the original black and white version and wasn't really a believer that they would be able to improve on it at all, I'm very glad to say I was wrong, this color crossme is even better. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This flick kept me glued to the screen. It didn't like a two hour movie at all. Rent, See, Buy!
B0040JHL90|5.0|These are the best running shoes I ever owned.  I had a pair I bought over a year ago that were very comfortable.  These fit the same.  I may order another while I can still get them.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very enjoyable. Some laugh out loud moments, but overall gentle humor. Wonderful characters and excellent acting from a great cast. Overall a delightful movie.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I have always played the free games on kindle so when today this game was free I immediately downloaded it and man it was awsome!! the puzzles were easy in many places but sometimes I had to take a hint from the hint guide.A nice hour or so passed to complete it but it was worth it. I wish to play more games like this!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|i have always like all the mahjong i have played and i would tell all my family and friends of this game
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|ive been waiting forever to get this game all my freinds have it and ive been missing out.  if you play dragon story you may be aware that that game just wants u to buy buy buy with real money but this game does not do that just please give this game a chance.  also if your mad about their being no decorations and buildings and stuff on dragon story and how u need freinds on dragon story to expand dragonvale has 8&times; as much dacorations and building compareing to dragon story and you don't need freinds at all and expanding u just tap on stuff and it is gone u don't expand in groups I highly recommend this game
B0052FYPJK|5.0|Just read it. It may have the same effect on you as it had on me. Bruce, I wish I could have met you. Rest in Paradise.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|These are going to be a great gift for my 5 year old Grand-Daughter. She wanted them for her birthday  In October.Her mom said not now ,but we will see at Christmas. So I was told about the Lego's So I got the pink set just for her, because she loves pink. And this is one of the gifts she will get from her grandpa & myself for Christmas.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really enjoy Ken Follett and I did enjoy this book but I felt like the editor was afraid of releasing a book over 1000 pages so it felt like there was some serious editing. It seemed like there were some major gaps in the personal stories and also in regards to the Pacific part of the war. Regardless it was an excellent read and I did learn things I didn't know before about this time in our history.
B000I0QL82|5.0|This is a Christmas classic.  Perfect film for the holidays.  Black and white film and a brilliant musical and amazing acting.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|i bought the cd for the 2nd track, although the others songs are great they just all sound the same
0425263916|5.0|if you loves fifty shades, you will love this series as well. 100 pages in and so far so good
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game i play this game every day on my kindle and its really fun my whole family asks me if they can play thats how much fun it is
034580404X|4.0|I put off reading this series because I've heard curious things about it and the Twilight background made me just roll my eyes. Finally, curiosity got the best of me and here I am. I just wanted to know what the fuss was about. As a person who rather enjoys erotica of many flavours, I thought this was just going to be lovey-dovey porn due to the Twilight fanfiction background. It turned out to be not what I was expecting - in a good way. I've read Twilight and I've read The Story of O, so the first book (Fifty Shades of Grey) somewhat reminded me a bit of both at times. I certainly didn't expect BDSM when I picked it up, but that was just an added bonus. I obviously knew very little about this series when I started reading. I didn't even know that this was a series.<br /><br />The first and second books of the series are the better of the three, in my opinion, even if there is little plot involved in those two. I have this thing for character development and I dislike when an author takes a character and forgets that a zebra is still a zebra even if you paint it black. Christian Grey reminds me way too much of my boyfriend/fiance/whatever he decides to be on whatever day. Of course, Grey is far less believable and sometimes a bit too ridiculous, but that fact kind of makes this series frightening for me to read. I see so many similarities and it makes me wonder.<br /><br />Regardless, this series is worth a read if you don't mind a lot of erotica and, sometimes, repetitive erotica. Also, it's worth a read if you want to read something different from your girly lovey-dovey novels, are going through a break up or a rough point in a relationship and want to ball your eyes out (read the first book - your mental state will make the read more enjoyable), or if you're curious and even doubtful. It may surprise you. I was skeptical for many pages, and if you've read Twilight, you'll be sorely reminded of it on occasion. Nevertheless, I can - without a doubt - separate Edward Cullen from Christian Grey, for which I'm pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Don't read this book if you hate predictability or the first-person-present-tense point of view. If you plan on buying the first book, buy the second. You'll thank me later. You don't want to be running to Walmart at 2 AM, searching for Fifty Shades Darker in your pajamas.<br /><br />Overall, this was an interesting read. I don't regret picking it up.<br /><br />- Anda
0385333846|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. A classing among time travel books. SCi-fi fan or not, this is worth a read.<br /><br />High readability.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is so cool! I am on this app every day. You can breed dragons and your dragons can have compotishons. You can get floating islands and visit other peoples islands. GREAT APP FOR FREE OR IF IT WAS PAID STIL WORTH IT!
1608871452|5.0|This book is worth way more than the price and sure to become the most sought after collectable for fans of the show. The book itself is well made- quality paperstock, binding, etc. and richly colored photography and illustrations. I've always loved the whole enochian lore and the inside front and back covers/ pages are filled with artful enochian-type symbols from the show.I would highly recommend this book for any fans of the show, it is by far the best one out there. (I particularly like the bonus material of decal/ sticker symbols inside the book.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this game and played all the time on my dsi. So I was thrilled when I saw it on the kindle fire.  I love matching gems. it's. very. additive.  Awesome!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is a master writer his chapters come tolife with each page you turn. I can hardly put the book down but I don't want to read it to fast.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I bought this after buying and trying numerous other types of hands-free devices and I'm impressed with this device! It's small and easy to move from car-to-car if needed. The sound quality is better than any I've tried - and I've tried way too many. Easy to charge and the charge lasts a long time. Simple operation - just push the on button, allow a few seconds for it to find your phone and pair with it, then you're ready to go! Volume controls on either the SuperTooth or your phone make it easy to pump up the volume. The ringer is a Star Wars - type of theme which is ok, but the ability to change the ringtone to something else would be my only recommendation for this device. Not a big deal though but since they put so much into creating a great product, it would be cool to select a different ringtone. I have some significant hearing loss and this helps me tremendously. And, others can hear me on the other end, whether in conversation or just leaving a message, the voice comes out crystal clear unless I'm in a very bad cell reception area in which case the coverage would be to blame. Other than that, I highly recommend this small, portable, great sounding and reliable hands-free device!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Each book just keeps getting better and better.  Although I hated reading about what happened to the dog, I sure didn't feel bad about the next step Mitch took.  Fantastic read!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was recommended by my adult daughter as a book club read - I was hesitant because of the fantasy aspect description  - but talk about &#34;don't judge a book by it's cover&#34; - I could not put this book down!! I loved the characters and the description of each of the circus tents made me feel as if I was there ... I would highly recommend this book - different from what I've chosen in the past and an extremely welcome surprise!!
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|This is a great new LP and the download worked just great. No issues what so ever with it's installation.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A book club read - I was hesitant to read a narrative by Death himself - and I put the book down a few times in the very beginning ... But as the characters took shape and background story emerged - it was difficult to put down. What a heartwarming story in so many ways even with the backdrop of Nazi Germany and all of the sad events noted. This is a new all time favorite read ...
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Here is another great new CD download that I just downloaded. I am not a Country fan but this is not Country by any means. It is more Pop then anything. But has really good songs on it/
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|The Curious Case of Ben Button is pretty good.  I really enjoyed the movie and the actors that are featured, however I need to watch it again once it arrives at my house because I don't remember how amazed I really was by it.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|One of the best movies of all time, just had to get it for my collection of halloween and christmas movies
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I was really pleased with Captain America.  With all of the superhero movies that have come out in the past 10 years, there have been flops and hits.  I would say Captain America is a hit! At first the casting of Chris Evans as Capt. America ticked me off, I thought with all the actors in Hollywood they pick the Human Torch to play Capt. America.  But he does a really good job and the film holds itself together well.
6305428042|5.0|its a good movie, remembered seeing it when i was little and had to have it for my collection of movies
B0050PYNO4|3.0|I haven't watched Paul yet, but I can't wait to.  I heard good reviews from students at Purdue University in Indiana, who saw the film in a special preview that came to the school, but I don't know if I can trust the opinion of a Boilermaker.  I enjoy Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) so I'm sure I will like this film too. Plus who doesn't like Seth Rogen voicing an alien.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i love this game because i love the shows. wish i had more friends to play with though..i could do much better but its going pretty well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|gone Girl was a great suspenseful read. the only thing I didn't like about it was the ending, which was kind of a let-down.
B005I64U5C|5.0|This is a very good action movie. simply put, I liked it. Go ahead an psychoanalyze this all you like. If you like it go for it.
0061474355|5.0|It's a very, very well crafted introduction to what is one of my personal favorite trilogies. An amazing tale of a headstrong girl becoming a woman, all the while having to fight the dead and those who work to bring the dead back. An adventure and a mystery. Wonderful novel, recommended to anyone who can read.
0547884591|5.0|A great easy read. Clear cut answers on the topics of cooking, achievement and learning.<br />If you like Tim's other books you'll like this one.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Having seen the Stones in concert, read Keith's autobio and MJ's bio, and perused numerous books and articles about the Stones for 30+ years, and watched Charlie is My Darling a few times, this is the whipped cream. The cd-set brings the Stones full-circle. They began imitating others in their own style, then creating their own genre and defining themselves, and now being one that others imitate. By having the knowledge of the band and their personalities, as well as following the zeitgeist, this cd-set demonstrates the progression. I love that the work is pure. Each piece is self-contained and honest, the way the music and vocals should sound. I am pleased with adding yet another RS piece to my collection. I only wish that our newest generation of music listeners would see the value in the Stones work.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enjoyed this game. Looking forward to part 2. Liked the fact that you could choose difficulty level. I would recommend this game to those that enjoy solving puzzles and hidden objects games.
034580404X|5.0|If you haven't read these books, you better grab this box set! Way cheaper than buying at the store and you have all of them at once, they are quick reads and you won't want to wait for the next book..

B0087YYHZU|5.0|When we received this, our whole family was riveted to the screen, from our 6-year-old daughter to my 70-year-old in-laws.  We watched the whole movie and most of the making of documentary in one sitting.  In the following days, my daughters would find the parts they liked and watch them over and over, and even introduced their 3-year-old cousin to Gene Kelly.  Highly recommended!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Such a simple concept and such a great game. Endless hours of entertainment with increasingly challenging levels. Puzzle lovers will appreciate this game.
B002SEQ8ZM|5.0|The Coraline Limited Edition Gift Set is a great gift for anyone who liked the movie.  For just a few dollars more than the regular edition, you get an awesome case with cool little extras (including postcards).  Also, this set comes with the 2D and 3D versions of the movie with 4 pairs of glasses.  If you liked the movie this set is a must have; for children and adults alike.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I can't help but root for a happy ending here and im loving the story that leads up to it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really loved this latest book in the series, and I am already hungry for the next book.I look forward to see the new twist the author will take the characters to, especially Brandon Stark and Jon Snow.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|After reading another Jack Reacher novel, I had to find #1 and read it.  It was not dissappointing.  I am hooked on Reacher.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|You need to see this movie it is funny yet NOT.  The actors are really good in this movie also
B001NHNG64|4.0|I always enjoy a book that makes me think.  All Reacher books do this.  I like it when a book moves quickly and is hard to put down.  This book succeeds in this.
B00004XPPE|4.0|If you we a teenager when this movie cam out it scared the heck out of you.  People at this time were buying bomb shelters due to the problems going on.<br /><br />I like the movie because it makes you think.  WHAT IF
1451695195|5.0|This book is a good read and confirms what I have read written by Dr. David R Hawkins.  I love the ending very heart warming and strongly reccomend it
B009VA1FN6|1.0|I found this a very ordinary novel with predictable characters and plot. The writing was very simple showing no flair or imagination.  I would not recommend it to to anyone except those who liked  Mills and Boone books.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is a taut suspense novel. I like Flynn's Mitch Rapp character.  This is one of the best he has written.
B005FISBV2|4.0|As always, Dexter is captivating. We don't have Showtime, so we just wait and buy it on Blu-ray when the season comes out. It usually doesn't take us much more than a week or two to watch the season.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is outstanding to play because of the following facts:<br />1. You get to choose diffrent modes like Creative or Survival. The diffrence is survival you must live off of the natural resources around you and try not to get killed by zombies, spiders, or even drowning! In creative you are not pressured and have unlimited rescources to make whatever you can.<br />2. It is actualy pretty easy to control your character with the arrows and the screen. I only have an itsy problem but for some reason my character can NOT stop flying when I do what your supposed to do.<br />3. The last thing is the diffrent choices!!  It has so many diffrent things to use like bookcases to display ( not actualy read! ) , furnaces, a bed, paintings, or even flowers! Its adorable when you make a home &quot;homey&quot;!!<br />Hoped this helped!! Oh and you can only fly in creative mode! (; BYE!

B008LZHA3G|4.0|Since 2001, Bob Dylan has been rolling (and tumbling) with a string of critically lauded albums in which he appropriates and re-casts traditional American musical styles. These albums have ranged from great (\\"Modern Times,\\"\\"Love and Theft\\") to very good (\\"Together Through Life.\\") \\"Tempest,\\" the latest in this line, is a lot of fun but you get a gnawing sense that this trad phase is starting to wear itself out. There's some mighty purdy tunes here - \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" is a nice little up-tempo shuffle, both \\"Soon After Midnight\\" and \\"Long and Wasted Years\\" have lovely, rueful textures abetted by Charlie Sexton's gorgeous guitar work, while the Irish lilt that Donnie Herron's violin brings to the song, \\"Tempest,\\" makes it an enjoyable, if minor, addition to Dylan's canon of epic songs. (While I don't find the song boring, I admit the lyrics do sound as if James Cameron were trying to write his own version of \\"Desolation Row\\" - all effects, no poetry.)  Best of all are two tunes that demonstrate that the old master can still summon his powers: \\"Pay in Blood,\\" a full-throated growling jeremiad and \\"Tin Angel,\\" a stark tale of a murderous love triangle whose chilling atmospherics are supplied by Tony Garnier's bass guitar and Herron's mandolin.<br /><br />But then there's the over-reliance on blues tropes  - the annoying \\"Narrow Way\\" honks away in your ear for nearly eight long minutes and the enjoyable \\"Early Roman Kings\\" is too derivative (the ghost of Muddy Waters should sue for royalties). And finally, two very stilted ballads, \\"Scarlet Town\\" and his tribute to John Lennon, \\"Roll On John,\\" which might just rival Ringo's tribute to George from a few years ago, simply drag the album out.  It's an enjoyable - but quite familiar - latter-day Dylan album.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|We listen to through every night to help us sleep.  I bought the app to ensure I was supporting continued development of such fine products!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This Walking Dead is just awesome. By far the best thing on TV. If you like suspenseful and character rich show, this is for you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 does not disappoint! It has all the stuff you love from the previous seasons, and keeps the pressure on.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|Product was exactly as described. One dvd came loose, but there was no damage, unpreventable as dvd was wrapped and sealed (brand new). Thank you!  Have a merry Christmas!
0385742886|1.0|The book didn't really tie in to the other three books very well.  I really LOVED the Maze Rinner triolgy, but would never recommend reading this one

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Makes me laugh out loud.  Entertains the friends and family.  One of my favorite movies to watch.  If you like zombies and humor it is a must see.
B001BR5NH6|5.0|Its an awsome movie that arrived fast in a good package. I can not waite to watch it, Chet is the man.
055380684X|5.0|Excellent book for anyone interested in how we learn and why we become good at things. It does reference sports frequently, which helped me connect with it (especially when it talks about soccer), but the same truth applies to any skill you are interested in improving. It really made me examine the way I practice, and completely changing the way I look at improving a skill.<br /><br />One reason I did end up buying this was the endorsement it got from Jurgen Klinsmann and how he talked about improving skills on the soccer field. I'm big on self improvement and always want to be learning, and this is one I'm sure I'll reread again and again. I look forward to reading the successor to this book by the same author. Highly recommended to anyone interested in understanding how we become good at anything.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is a good movie with good acting and it came in good packaging and fast. No problems here. thanks
0316056871|4.0|great book about one of my favorite writers, tina fey. At times can be a bit distancing and female centric but that is to be expected. Overall this book is hilarious, full of stories from Tina's entire life and great lessons for any aspiring writer.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|When I purchased this book I thought it was the final book in the Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele series. This book is so similar it is very confusing! I did enjoy this series, but there is just no comparison to the original 50 Shades.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found it a little slow in the beginning but i am so glad I stuck with it, great book!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|The order arrived quickly and two-disc dvd contained interviews with the stars and the quality of the dvd quality was great!
000614182X|5.0|The characters, the time period, the sailing; how can you go wrong with a team like Aubrey and Maturin?  They are as immortal a pair as Holmes and Watson, Gilgamesh and Inkidu, Kirk and Spock! If you're a fan of the time period where men made things happen by their own hands and made decisions based on integrity, then this series of books are a must!
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I love the film because it was colorful and energetic.  Although I thought the plot was a little lame the actors did a great attempt at creating a fun musical.  It reminded me of The Birdcage.
B008EZVNO0|3.0|I wrote in a review of Greil Marcus's book about Van that Van is the only singer I know of who could sing the telephone book and make it interesting. Well, a couple of songs on this album, \\"Going Down to Monte Carlo\\" and \\"Educating Archie\\", put that claim to the test.  They contain some of the jaw-droppingly worst lyrics I've ever heard in a popular song.  The first of those gives us travel directions (\\"Goin' down to Monte Carlo/about 25k from Nice\\"); quotes from Sartre (\\"Sartre said hell is other people\\") and this, which wins the prize for awfulness: \\"Playing in the background in the restaurant, some kind of phony pseudo jazz\\".  Since it's a blues format, these get repeated, and they are coupled with blunt expressions of grumpiness and misanthropy like \\"Sartre said hell is other people, I believe that most of them are / Well their pettiness amazes me, even after I've gone this far\\".  So, I definitely recommend you skip that song.  As for Educating Archie, it sounds like a Lyndon LaRouche pamphlet: \\"You're a slave to the capitalist system / Which is ruled by the global elite\\"; also: \\"You're controlled by the media / Everything you say and do\\". For a closing song, it's quite a downer.  At least Marx called for workers to unite. This song just ends with \\"just can't fight\\".  Whew. And he complains that his record companies don't promote him hard enough. What can you do with something like that?<br /><br />What I always loved about Van, as I wrote in a review of Magic Time, and where he is unique, is his ability to write songs about mundane details of life, like sitting on a hill with a friend or cleaning windows, and turn them into songs bursting with life.  But there is the grumpy Van who doesn't get enough money from his record company and shows up on albums like \\"What's Wrong With This Picture\\". Well, on this album you get a little more of the latter than I care for.<br /><br />Fortunately, the album is redeemed by \\"Close Enough for Jazz\\" (which is a pretty ironic title on an album that complains about someone else's \\"pseudo jazz\\" but artists aren't required to be logically consistent - that's someone else's pseudo jazz) and also by \\"Retreat and View\\" and \\"Pagan Heart\\" while \\"Open Your Heart\\" is a pretty bland but generally enjoyable track.<br /><br />I conclude that Van passes the test - he can sing any song and make it interesting, at least once.  I have all of Van's albums and so I bought this one sight unseen.  But many potential buyers may want to buy individual songs as opposed to the whole kitbag.
B00005JPAO|5.0|What a marvelous take on what might have happen behind the scene after the tragic death of Princess Diana.  It made me very sympathetic toward the Queen who was brought up to believe in a completely different life, but became aware that she needed to change too.
B005HP2JAM|1.0|My entire family was bored to the point of parody by the end of this movie.  How many times can you show the same wall art in one movie??  This one breaks a world record I'm sure.  At best this should have been 20 minutes long to setup the find, deliver the images and then give final impressions.  Instead it drags on and on and on.  The 3d on our set was double image as well.  We all (family of 5 diverse people) give it 1 star.
6305128952|4.0|Although this is suppose to be a love story, it takes a backsit to healing the spirit of both horse and rider who had a horrendous accident together and can't get over the memory.  Beautiful landscapes and what life should be all about. Family and togetherness.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its entertaining<br />this game is entertaining. it also is non stop until you run out of energy. my only issue is when you run out of energy they prompt you to buy more.
B000YHG72E|4.0|If you like Will Ferrell, you'll love this movie! There are so many moments in the movie that just make you bust out laughing uncontrollably! From the giant baby in an elf world, to the soda drinking........&#34;Did you hear that?&#34; to the spaghetti breakfast!<br /><br />It also holds true to Christmas and the true meaning of what it's all about, with a touching moment at the end that gets you everytime.<br /><br />A classic Christmas movie to put in the library to watch each December!

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved the book and the movie is well done too. They were able to cast the characters to fit in with the book.
B009157BWU|5.0|The filmmakers lucked out on this one.  For all the hard work and the horrors of the bugs and sticky stuff on equipment, the heat and the hard-going, they were rewarded with a documentary which actually has a storyline worthy of a novel.  As we nature film watchers all know, most documentaries are &#34;slice of life&#34; where nothing coherent happens and the filmmakers try to splice together a coherent story of group or family survival or a threat from poachers or SOMETHING to hang the footage on.<br /><br />This one is not contrived at all but a straight out gripping story of one little chimp struggling for acceptance.<br /><br />In today's world of competitive employment and school bullying, we can all relate.
1609611543|5.0|Everyone should read this book! A friend told me about it and I am amazed as to what our graihs have become in this country. I have watched carefully the amount of grains I eat and with my daily exercise find it easier to keep my weight steady. No more sugar rushes.

0307592731|4.0|Parts of this book made me think it might have some fiction thrown in it. Who walks around in duct tape shoes? on a trail? If she really did this it is an interesting read.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|As a big fan of &#34;The Proposition,&#34;  I was excited to see Australian director, John Hillcoat, team up again with French cinematographer, Benoit Delhomme, for this uniquely American true story of Virginia bootleggers during Prohibition.  It exceeded my already high expectations!<br /><br />Beautifully shot, masterfully crafted, great pacing with no flat spots and a story that ropes you in and won't let go.  The characters are as intoxicating as the moonshine they're selling.  Run, don't walk, to see anything with the rising star, Tom Hardy, who in my book is the heir to the legendary Marlon Brando.  He and the brilliant Guy Pearce deliver two stellar, shape-shifting performances that embody what great acting is all about.  One of the strengths of Director Hillcoat is his gift for getting solid, moving performances out of ALL his actors.  No weak links in THIS chain.<br /><br />I was so impressed with &#34;Lawless&#34; that I watched it again the next day, something I rarely do.  I have also recommended it to all of my friends, although the true Cinephiles had already seen--and loved it!.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was my first zombie book I have read besides the walking dead comics.  It was a combination of a bunch of short stories that all came together to tell how the war started and goes through individual stories or highlights of the war.  It was entertaining and a quick read.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I have recently gotten very into all things Sherlock Holmes.  The classic books, the movies, the TV shows.  This show puts a completely different and awesome spin on things.  The roles were excellently cast, and after watching could not imagine it with any other actors.
B0041LG08U|4.0|This is a beautiful watch. The only problem I had was that the band wasn't long enough. I contacted the Seiko USA service site to order extra links and was told that this model was not a USA model.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show never fails to make me laugh!  Also, it occasionally makes me curious about the things that they are talking about, both the science and the nerdy stuff.  Makes me wish I knew a group of guys like them!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last book of this trilogy, the same as the ones before, you can´t stop reading, you want to get to the end and once you finish it you start missing it. Great ending.
0316228532|5.0|Although I had not read the Harry Potter series, I was eager to try her effort for adults, as I surmised that she must weave a wonderful tale.  Not only was I not disappointed, I loved every word.  I very seldom read fiction, but I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's the first time in years that I couldn't put a book down, and I only wish that it had been twice as long.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|great game and its free halfbrick did q great job again I have played it for about 15 hours and I got it 3days ago
B009S5IZJQ|4.0|An Italian and La Sesión Cubana - this title made me eagerly buy the album. Staying in Cuba for a while, he was learning from the natives about cubanian life and by all latin-american music style.  This album is different to other favourate albums. Those who are familiar with Zuccheros music will be surprised. Though containing known songs like \\"Cuba libre\\" or \\"Un Kilo\\" or the \\"Baila\\" and new songs helpfully produced by and with Cubanian might get you appetit on listening, defining the Italian maestro is hard, it is unsually soft and missing the familiar flair. However, the album is recommendable in any way, I am surely looking forward The Zucchero and his wonderful varying voice ever.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|loved it .gift for my son who has seen movie several times. cant wait to recieve the movie in the mail
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is awesome! I have been waiting for it to come out for android for some time now and I was very excited to find it for my Kindle Fire HD. The only issue I have come across is adding friends. The game automatically added a couple of my friends that play the game, but not all. When you go to social to add frends all it does is send an invitation on FB. There is no way to search for friends you know are playing.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the twilight series! i bought this new so of course it came in new(: it was in it's plastic package and the DVDs were clean, me and my boyfriend watched it, so overall i enjoyed it :D
B009B0L324|5.0|First off, I've been a die-hard fan for over 30 years (I've seen every concert since the \\"For Those About To Rock\\" tour at least once), so this review might be a little bias. Before I review the cd, I have to address the low ratings from other reviewers. To give this cd less than 5 stars is just wrong. To give it 2 stars is criminal. The reviewers say the setlist is \\"predictable,\\"\\"tired,\\"and \\"boring.\\" The setlist isn't boring, it's C-L-A-S-S-I-C.  The problem any band has that has been around for a long time is that they have TONS of songs, and tons of hits. This is the case with AC/DC, they have waaay too many hits to play in one concert. I'm sure they would play for 5 hours if they could, but they can't. Angus simply can't flop around and \\"duck walk\\" for that long, so they're forced to pick and choose songs (like any other band). MANDATORY songs at an AC/DC concert are \\"Back in Black,\\" \\" Hells Bells,\\" \\"For Those About To Rock, We Salute You,\\" \\" Highway to Hell,\\" \\"Whole Lotta Rosie,\\"etc. You find these songs on AC/DC compilations or live CDs because they are C-L-A-S-S-I-C songs; these are the songs the audience WANTS to hear. These reviewers clearly aren't die-hard fans, and that's totally okay, no problem there. They have every right to their opinion, but to say this cd is boring is totally untrue.<br /><br />The reason I LOVE live CDs is because they are more \\"natural\\" than studio CDs. Studio CDs should be virtually perfect. After all, if the band messes up, they just do it again. This isn't the case with the live stuff. Anything can go wrong during a live show, and usually does. In a live show strings break, pickups short out, batteries to wireless units go dead (during the song!), straps break, picks break (or are dropped!), and amps blow. This is also when you find out if the sound guy/girl padded their resume. Even things that aren't equipment related can happen, like the lead guitarist blowing the solo or the singer being a bit off key. And sometimes feedback happens, which to me is a beautiful thing when it is controlled properly. Anyway, AC/DC isn't immune to these problems, and they do happen (yes, Angus has blown a solo before), and these \\"glitches\\" do show up in their live CDs as well.<br /><br />One last thing I want to touch on. Another reviewer mentioned they were happy Phil Rudd (drums) was on this CD. Chris Slade is/was a studio drummer (not sure if he still is), who is literally a perfect drummer. The problem AC/DC had with him is that he was extremely by the book, and Phil will go outside the box, so to speak. Phil \\"swings\\" more, has more feel to the music and doesn't worry about being technically perfect. Phil also has a simpler approach and AC/DC's style doesn't require a lot of \\"busy-ness\\" where drums are concerned. I had the pleasure of meeting AC/DC and Chris years and years ago in my band days, and not only is Chris a superb drummer, but he's also a heck of a nice guy.<br /><br />For aspiring musicians, check out their CDs AND DVDs because AC/DC are an excellent example of straight forward rock n roll. They prove that you don't need exotic chord structures or chord progressions to sound AWESOME. They're also an excellent example of a superbly tight rhythm section, which is a critical element of any band.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was very funny, though it was a little drawn out in some parts. There are seriously laugh out loud moments. Definitely a must read.
B008M0UTRO|5.0|Set in the early 1960s in Yokohama, From Up on Poppy Hill details the story of 16yo Umi Matsuzaki. Umi's father is dead. Her mother, a doctor,  is away in the United States. Living at home, Umi remains the dutiful young Japanese female teenager. She wakes early to set the rice cooking. She prepares lunches. She takes care of her grandmother (loved seeing her still in her traditional kimonos) and her younger sisters while her mother is away. She raises the signal flags outside her home, because that's what her father and she used to do together before he was killed in the Korean War. She goes to school and is a good student. One day at school she finds herself the subject of a poem. A poem that is romantic! Who could have written it? As if that were not enough trouble, Shun Kazama, the local heartthrob, jumps down from high up on a building. Right in front of her!! This causes the entire school to focus on her.<br /><br />Suddenly Umi finds herself taken to Quartier Latin, a local club housed in an old worn-down building, by her younger Sora who wants an autograph from Umi. It is there that she encounters Shun again. This charming building is the subject of much fierce debate about its usefulness and its future. The governing body of the school wish it to be torn down and so do the majority of the students of the school. Umi finds herself caught between the battling philosophies waging war against Japan. As Japan throws itself headlong into the future while readying itself for the 1964 Olympics that will be held in Tokyo, people are everywhere tearing down old buildings, forgetting the past, and distancing themselves from the culture of their parents. Others resist this movement and try to preserve as much of the past as they can. Here is a Studio Ghibli film that you will find in many other films - the idea of balance. While elsewhere that balance is between the human world and the environment, here Studio Ghibli explores the idea of balance between the past and present and future. The character of Umi suggests that the building could be spruced up and maybe that would sway popular opinion. And so Umi, Shun, and the students of the school find themselves racing to battle \\"progress\\".<br /><br />The secondary story line concerns the relationship between Umi and Shun. To describe it in detail would be to ruin certain surprises that add a certain degree of drama to the movie. This relationship is a poignant, quiet one and as beautifully done in any Studio Ghibli film.<br /><br />I have now watched every single Studio Ghibli film (and if you click on my name you can see my reviews of those films). From Up on Poppy Hill is in the spirit of Whisper of the Heart, Only Yesterday, and Ocean Waves. Most Americans are familiar with the more fantastical Studio Ghibli films - think Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Ponyo, but I tend to find that films like From Up on Poppy Hill touch both my heart and mind more than the fantastical films. That's just my opinion and my favorite Studio Ghibli film still remains the fantastical My Neighbor Totoro. From Up on Poppy Hill is a worthy addition to the Studio Ghibli cannon and shows greater maturity from Gorō Miyazaki (the directory of the terrible Tales From Earthsea). Now I am looking forward to Takahata's The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, which will be released sometime in 2013.sent and future.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|Great game, my seven year old son enjoys playing.  However, it's too bad that it has to contain so many ads.  I know, it's free.  Is there a way to change the format or design to one's choosing?  Such as, board pattern, color, chess piece colors, background, etc.?  That would be a cool option.  Thanks!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've tried all the MS simulator apps and I've found OfficeSuite Pro to have the most functionality. The interface is intuitive and even plays nice with Google Cloud. The spreadsheet is by far more robust than some of its competitors.
B0050KTR36|5.0|Nice photos, illustrations, information, etc.  However, I wish it didn't take up so much memory on my iPhone.  Other than that, it's very educational for all ages.  Recommend it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is for the blu-ray set.  First, as at least one other reviewer has said, this comes in packaging that is like a book, where a page is a sleeve which holds a disc.  The back side of the page/sleeve is plastic, and the front side is paper that has information about the disc written on the outer facing for you to read.  So, the readable side of the disc is sliding against plastic when you remove the disc, so it's best to do this with care.  I disagree with another reviewer that this will damage the disc over time.  Blu-ray discs are more durable than CDs and DVDs, and it's very hard to scratch one.  Maybe if you watch the movies more than once a month you should buy plastic disc cases to put them in.  However, the disc are more likely to be damaged when you place it on your coffee table and then your dog or kid grabs it, chews on it, etc...<br /><br />On to the movies.  I only watched the first one so far, and I thought the picture was very good for a remastered 1970s movie (or was it very early 80s?).  I didn't expect it to be any better, so I would say that for the quality of the picture, if you like the Indiana Jones movies this set is worth it when priced well.  The sound was acceptable to me, but I was listening to it via the TV and not a sound system.<br /><br />As far as the movies themselves, well there are too many reviews covering the movies.  Most people like 1 and 3, they tolerate 2, and the 4th is a mixed bag.<br /><br />Overall I feel the set's worth it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app.  It's also great to use on iPhone.  Great ideas.  I'm hooked.  I have and will continue to recommend this to friends and family.  It's so fun!
0553108034|5.0|I'm loving these books so far! You really start to care about each character, and getting the story from all the different perspectives really helps suck you in!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 8 year old son loves playing this game.  I got it on my new kindle HD last week and he has been playing Angry birds every night since.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I'm unable to start a new game of solitaire after I complete one game.  I've been able to play one game of solitaire per day, but I can not start a new game after I finish the first game.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|If you have ever wondered why we go to war, you will probable like this show. If you are not interested in the politics of war, you'll at least be entertained.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a great app.the only thing i dislike about it is that  you can tilt the devise to get coins,and with my kindle its harder than my ipod.overall its a really great app!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun and I'm a sucker for cute little animals and toys.<br />l don't really get the object of the game tho and itmay take years.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I like knowing how the people involved think and how the decisions they make evolve. It is wordy, but to my liking. History is fascinating, especially when written by a respected author. This is my first book on Kindle and I am enoying reading with it.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|For 99&cent;, this app was a steal. It's so relaxing, addictive, and fun!! But don't just take my word...try it and see for yourself!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Excellent movie. Very thought provoking with an all star cast. The movie was also very well directed. However, it was a zone 2 movie  coming from America I was only able to view it on my computer.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I purchased this CD for my 15 year old daughter.  She loves it!  The music is amazing and the Yearbook Edition is a nice plus for a 1D collector.  I am quite pleased with this purchase.  Would highly recommend to anyone that loves this boy band!!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie is the first Wes Anderson directed movie that we've seen, and now we're eager to rent all of his movies. This style reminded me of Stars Hollow from Gilmore Girls and the off-kilter world of Pushing Daisies. Having stars like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand just add to the enjoyment of the unique world that has been created.  The bottom line is that if you don't enjoy quirkyness comedy, you won't like or understand the movie.
B0019QEG90|5.0|I love the selection of this album so much. Highly recommendable! You need to buy this album. Wow! I love it!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Push aside the initial reaction to the mash-up of Abraham Lincoln and vampires, and you get a really stylized vampire story from the creative mind of Tim Burton. The movie has a great look, and the action/fight scenes play out very well, even in today's digital environment where anything can be done visually. I think this movie will end up being one of the cult classics in the vampire genre - and you can guess which side the vampires are on!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is inspirational to hear that there is a link between science and spirituality. Although I can feel the frustration of the author trying to express the beauty and love he experienced, it is comforting to hear about his experience.  I appreciate his effort to relate to us what life beyond here is like.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|I am really enjoying this read - just 40% through and loving it.  It is the best Grisham I have had in a while - and best overall thriller - back to the quality of the early Grishams which were his best
B0099G3I96|5.0|OK, so I read some of the other reviews, and I generally have to disagree.  Yes, there is no Don't Speak or Hey Baby on this album.  But there are lots of fine songs, and its a musical work of art.  I like every single song on it, which I can't say of any other No Doubt or Gwen Stefani album.  All the attention seems to be on Push and Shove and Settle Down, when Looking Hot and Undone and Sparkle and Heaven are just as good.  Yes, she didn't just break up with someone and hasn't got the wave of pain passing through the music, she's happy (more or less), and it's harder to write Don't Speak under those circumstances.  But it's obviously a No Doubt album, and more than worth buying and listening to, and not just once.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|This is a great popcorn super hero movie.  The Blu Ray edition looks crisp and clear, and the additional materials on the disc were great fun to watch.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|A friend of mine was listening to Next to Me, and I was amazed.  Bought the album.  Her voice is so powerful, and the songs stay in your head and get to you.  Next to Me is the best, but Heaven, Where I Sleep, Suitcase, River and Lifetime are all staying in my rotation.  None of the songs are bad, the whole album stayed in my MP3 for weeks.  A couple are going to be classics.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Nolan took this hero franchise and grounded it with real world rules.  His interpretation of Batman avoids comic book trappings in favor of a kinetic pace that drives a story of revenge and justice.  A little Count of Monte Cristo mixed with some Scarlet Pimpernel, Batman Begins chronicles the story of Bruce Wayne, a billionaire heir who forgoes the corporate life in favor of the nightly pursuit of justice.<br /><br />Although some flaws exist in the film, this is the entry point to one of the best super hero movie franchises in film history.<br /><br />Nolan was an exemplary choice to direct these films.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the best yet and I hope another comes out soon so I can read it again and again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the game but there is way to many adds.<br />one of the most scariest and most frightening adds I ever seen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Definitely a great app to have on your device. It is simple to operate, and I appreciate bring able to have easy access to multiple translations of the Bible. You can highlight verses/passages, and write notes on your readings. Reading plans are provided.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|I got it for my baby niece that comes over every Sunday.  She loves playing with my iphone or ipad or even my 3 ipods.So I got her this app on my kindle fire and she loves it!!!!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Saw parts of this back when it was free. Originally pre-ordered it for me and a friend at about fifteen dollars and then it dropped to ten. Which was nice. Either way I'm happy to have this in my collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is challenging but fun and also some of the games on there I have never heard of which I thought was weird but I manage
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game so so so so so so so so so so so so so much. its like the new temple run but better!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Stop compareing this to the Pc version its not they are still adding stuff it came out on the android market 2 months ago there not going to have every thing
B003VIWO9I|4.0|I love the discworld books to do with the chalk, and this is one of them. Not the best though.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|These books are easy reads and only have one theme to them.  Not much of a plot, but then again who needs a plot?
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I just finished reading the fifth book of the Wool series, purchased separately so it won't appear as a verified purchase review. For a while I wandered if there is a good reason to add the n+1 review when n>2,500. Nevertheless, I was sufficiently impressed with Mr. Howey's writing to add another review. My first recommendation - buy the books and read them! For anyone who has a fixation on SF stories, SF true to its original source, it is a must. This series delightfully conforms to the traditional SF, where you create an imaginary setting in order to examine the ways people think and act in a context that allows more flexibility than simple fiction. The prose is fluid, the story moves practically effortlessly and the story line makes seamless transitions from one chapter to another and from one book to the next. There is the right admixture of action and introspection. In a nutshell, it is a well-deserved relief from the current surfeit of futuristic not-quite-porn, witches and wizards fantasy that fail to create a real imaginary world, pseudo-medieval quests for morons, etc, etc. Mind you, there are wonderful fantasy or erotic books out there. They are buried, however, under the avalanche of trash.<br /><br />Howey is a professional and writes much, much better than most. I read each of his five Wool books while in transit from one place to another during the still on-going US trip. I read in limo's, on planes, in subways, waking up at sleepless jet-lag nights. Thank you Mr. Howey. You made my trip so much easier.<br />Now, to the less pleasant part. What's missing, at least in this humble critic's opinion. Somebody wrote in a review that Wool is on the way to become an SF classic. Although it has the potential, I feel that it doesn't quite make it. The series is still written in the short story/novelette style, leaving no real space for developing characters .Too many are two-dimensional stereotypic cut-outs. My second problem, the credibility of the background.For example, why does a silo that appears to possess quite impressive recovery, recycling and IT technology, rely on foot transport and fails to make at least a simple hoist to transport goods vertically? Is it to create artificial labor market for strong but mentally challenged Porters? It reminds me of the first Matrix movie, where the underground operates superb and mysterious technology, but hasn't quite mastered knitting sweaters, or at least darning the holes in them. The third problem - the philosophy that drives the story is mostly obvious, although there are very neat surprises, like the discovery of the reasons for the existence of the silo. And, pardon my candor, this is not the thirties! Where is the sex (not as a main leitmotif, but as something that keeps people occupied for the last four million years)? Does its absence have something to do with energies spent on climbing the stairs?<br />If not for these deficiencies (which hardly impinge on the pleasure of reading the books), I'd have graded it at full five. So four it is, but on my own scale with better resolution, it is 4.4.<br />I am currently putting the last touches on my first book (you can get a couple of chapters for preview by mailing me at medfair@yaoho.com). Reading my critique of Wool I realized it applies to my own writing as well. So back to the grindstone and thank you again Mr. Howey. I am confident that your future books will be even better and I am looking forward to reading them.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Good story line. Not easy to guess outcome. Guilty party well disguised. Having traveled to these countries makes locations and geograpy more captivating in following the story.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like the format, when I first started reading, but I soon found it told a complete story, and quickly learned the characters, by their letters.  It was hard to put down, and I kept sayintg, I'll read just one more letter.  I didn't know much about the Channel Islands, especially how they had to cope, during the German occupation.  Besides being connected to the people of the island, it was a real history lesson.  I would recommend it to both male and female.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like this one.  the only think I don't like is when some prizes fall where its obviously going over the edge.  It's allgood though.  A fun time waster.
B009VB97EY|1.0|plot was miserable,  they are not the best actors in the world,  even my wife was bored with this crap!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is by far the best game I have ever played. There is not a single thing I disliked. Even though some things were tricky, I didn't mind beacause I love tricky things! I've already played the whole game, and the best part is, now I can play it all over again!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Saw this in the theatre with my 5yr old and now we've watched it at home too and it's great.  Beautiful animation, great music, good message.
0307346617|2.0|World War Z is as full of stereotypes as it is of different POVs.  Here are a few:<br /><br />(SPOILERS)<br /><br />Hello, I'm China.  The outbreak of Zombies started here.  I tried to hide it from the rest of the world to save face.<br /><br />Hello, I'm Israel.  I figured out what was going on but no one believed me.<br /><br />Hello, I'm a Palestinian.  Kill the Jews!<br /><br />Hello, I'm the CIA.  You guessed it, I'm incompetent.<br /><br />Hello, I'm a generic Indian narrator.  I know more about boats than I should considering I'm supposed to be an office manager.<br /><br />Hello, I'm an American celebrity.  I think I'm supposed to be Paris Hilton and Glen Beck, but the author won't say.  I'm greedy and stupid, of course!<br /><br />Hello, I'm the US military.  I can't figure out how to shoot a Zombie in the head.  Go figure.<br /><br />Hello, I'm the zombie hoards.  I don't actually appear much in this book.<br /><br />Hello, I'm South Africa.  I came up with the plan to save humanity.  Why South Africa, you ask?  Well, Africa has to appear in the book somewhere, right?<br /><br />Hello, I'm a women narrator.  I went to northern Canada with my family because the TV told me to.  Hey, no one said it would be cold up here!  Oh well, at least they have great people soup.  Yummy!<br /><br />Hello, I'm the president.  I'll tell you a secret... I'm Barak Obama!<br /><br />Hello, I'm white collar America.  Apparently I can't figure out how to build things and don't know how to fix things and I can't learn how. Oh yeah, I'm racist too.<br /><br />Hello, I'm Cuba.  I'm a hero in this book!  Hey, wait a minute.... did Michael Moore write this?<br /><br />Hello, I'm a nameless government official in the middle of the book.  I'm talking a lot about FDR and how his ideas helped me form a new government bureaucracy that was able to reorganize American society.  Wow, you can't imagine how hard it is to work with white collar people.  Sheesh, they're dumb.  Let's have them dig that hole over there.<br /><br />Hello, I'm........ZZZZZZzzzzzzzz...<br /><br />What you fell asleep?  That's about when I fell asleep too.<br /><br />...<br /><br />OK, in all seriousness, there are a lot of people who liked this book.  Many of you reading this probably liked it---it just wasn't my cup of tea.  This book takes itself VERY seriously.  It was hard for me to go there.  It also got pretty dry in the middle.  Because I didn't enjoy it and couldn't finish it, I gave it two stars.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great fun. Challenging but not overly difficult. Looking forward to playing against others and against myself for time. Be careful though it can become addicting!
B00962341U|5.0|I have been waiting a very very long time for Glassheart and it definitely was worth the wait. It's a mix of old and new Leona styles. The songs titled Un Love Me,Lovebird, Fireflies, Stop the Clocks, When It Hurts, and Fingerprints are all the type of tunes that Leona fans typically would enjoy from her. She surprises us though with Trouble, Come Alive, I to You, Shake You Up, Favourite Scar, Glassheart, and on the deluxe version of the album, Sugar. Also, the acoustic versions of Come Alive, Trouble, and Glassheart, on the deluxe version of the album, are beyond amazing. Whether you like Leona's music or not it really can not be denied that her vocals are beyond spectacular. Few singers have a voice half as good as hers and she deserves massive amounts of praise for this fantastic album.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Fagan can do no wrong.  This is not his best, but better than most material shoved down the ear canals of frustrated consumers. Sweet, slick, well produced and written.  A listening pleasure.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I've only been able to get through the first few chapters and must say I'm very happy with my purchase.  Well worth the price in my opinion.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|Deserves NO STARS!<br /><br />Lazy, cliched, boring and unintelligible.  This is a ponderous piece of dreck and I don't understand how anyone can like this movie.<br /><br />I actually want my $5 back.<br /><br />First and foremost, you can't understand a damn word that anyone says and bang up job not having any captions Amazon!  The cast mumbles and whispers as they lumber around waiting for the next set piece.<br /><br />Second, it moves at a snails pace with movie of the week dialogue with a tacked on insipid love story.<br /><br />Listen to me.... don't rent or buy this.  Don't watch it on cable.  Ignore it.  There are so many more things you can do in an hour and fifty five minutes.  Take a walk, go see a better movie, read a book, make love, call a relative, take a day trip, feed the homeless, visit a park.  DO ANYTHING ELSE but don't spend your time with this.<br /><br />As for all the positive reviews - Emperor's New Clothes.  Those poor souls got got and had the wool pulled over their heads.<br /><br />As Tom Hardy says in this movie, \\"goeavnoanoeaonaa aovaoea aoveaoe, go'on get\\"<br /><br />Garbage!
B004FOA84A|4.0|not the game I was looking for, but fun, didn't take long to finish, but for the price, kept me entertained for an hour.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking up married 4 stars<br /><br />I haven't read a harlequin series since maybe at least a decade ago.<br />Harlequin had been around for quite sometime now and this is one proof why.<br />With the hundreds of books they published over the years, there are times when the plot can be cliche, like this one,  but what makes it stick out like a sore thumb is how their talented authors tell the story.<br />This first book in their new KISS series is a keeper, Mira lyn Kelly is a very talented author capable of evoking emotions from her readers at will. Her words stir emotions that I don't get to feel a lot reading contemporary romance novels...and I read a lot of them. Ms Kelly had me smiling at some smart line  Megan said and my insides stirred when Connor realized what he'd lost, she had me reeling at the sight of the messages to Jeff in chapter 22; .the characters were developed in a solid way giving the reader a concrete background on where the character's perception is coming from. The hurt, the love, the joy they feel are validated with this background. A talented author with a cliche plot is equal to a reader losing much needed sleep...<br /><br />Kudos to Ms Kelly for stirring my insides with this book!<br />Hats-off to Harlequin for this new series avid readers would sure love.<br /><br />I'd give this a 4.5star, but shaved half off because of a couple of typo errors.
B000FC13MM|5.0|From a young age I hoarded books with the obsessiveness of a dragon gathering her shining treasure into a pile and sleeping wrapped around it, heart glowing with content. So when I say that among the hundreds of books in my trove I have a special shelf for the books closest to my heart, you can well expect that the books on that shelf are extraordinary. Sabriel is one of those books.<br /><br />Sabriel caught me at an age when stories have a heightened power over the developing brain, when they most easily take up residence in us and shape the way we grow up to view the world. Sabriel still forms a large part of the framework of my personal mythos, along with other books on that Shelf of the Most Shining Tales, like The Last Unicorn, The Silmarillion, and The Neverending Story.<br /><br />Don't miss adding this tale to your soul's ingredients.
0061122416|5.0|One of my best read books yet. A friend knew my family was having a difficult time and recommended this book for me.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, so much so I finished it in one night. Granted I used the hints a few times thank goodness they were there otherwise I'd probably be stuck &amp; frustrated! Nice graphics &amp; music. Worked great on my first gen Kindle Fire!
B005HHSXP0|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and liked that the storey continues. These are fast paced so good for young readers. I have read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy and found this very enjoyable diversion.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Wish it was longer but it is a good game. Hope you make a part 2. Love hidden object puzzle games.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This DVD is one of a kind. A great group of musicians playing off one another and obviously having a good time doing it. The audio and video are done really well when you consider this performance was 30 years ago. Several reviews made negative comments about Lefty Dizz's performance but he is an incredible guitar player and certainly not the only one onstage that had a few cocktails. Lefty was able to play a standard right handed guitar upside down without having it restrung, truly a talented musician. The impromptu style of this performance is what makes it such an amazing show!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Lots of introspection, not sure I liked the ending though...dont think the movie will be able to adequately convey thebthe book's multitude of emotions
B00932DCS8|5.0|I can find no fault with this movie. The action was stacked one event on top of another, there were parts that I couldnt bear to watch and, by the way, how did I find myself rooting for the art thief??? I woke up today thinking about this movie...pitch perfect.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This set is perfect!  The sequel is on of the best!  The third movie although not as popular is still a necessary part to the trilogy and I respect if for what it is.  Overall this set is a MUST HAVE!
B005LAIHR2|3.0|This DVD had great old time music that I wanted to hear.<br />The acting was just ok.<br />Glad I got it
B005FDXT32|5.0|This movie is awesome!  Al Pacino is amazing!  The story and action is great as well!  I highly recommend this movie!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This DVD was all and more of what it said it would be.<br />Just wish there was more skin and full frontal
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|This movie is awesome!!  The different versions really do a great job of changing things up in your mind about what happened.  I highly recommend this movie!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not easily impressed and I've never written an Amazon book review before. That should speak for me, but I'll toss a little detail in for the author. I'm a writer but I'm not an author. I'm an IT administrator. I wrangle sensitive data that is critical to human lives. And I protect that data. From my vantage point atop my racks and patch bays, this story has that sharp musical ring of potential, those hints of a possible future so believable that it utterly unsettled me over the 8 hours in which I read it. Another reviewer said something about meaningless detail. Absurd. The detail is both necessary and realistic. The stairway itself and stairwell both metaphors, And I simply gobbled up the contemplation of the stair treads at the outset, the handrail and welds, the layers of paint, all details referencing layers of a very human set of interwoven stories and substories....... and with a satisfying hard sci-fi feel that I absolutely love. The main characters are well developed and the supporting characters waiting to step in and grow. I want to learn more about these people, about these microcosms, about the history and the science of this world, and THAT, my friends, is what good fiction does, whether it's Jane Austen or Andre Norton. In retrospect, I would have spend four times the $6 on this tale. And Mr. Howey, I'm waiting for that opportunity. Jane
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|The cast is perfect in this version!  The music is excellent as well!  The whole production is done VERY well!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|So far I love everything about this case except for the fact that it requires the case to be open in order to charge the Kindle. However, that small complaint is not a real issue for how well the case functions.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The story, the actors, the directing, everything is perfect!  These movies are amazing!  Everyone of them is a classic!  I highly recommend this set!!!
B008LZHA3G|3.0|\\"Roll On John\\", Mr. Dylan's tribute to his friend John Lennon, is moving and heartfelt. It is my favorite of all the songs written about him. Unfortunately, none of the rest of the tunes on this CD are nearly as good. Mr. Dylan's touring band provides a solid backing, but their lines are so repetitive and simple that one loses interest rather quickly. And the lyrics are not enough to hold one's attention for long. Mr. Dylan seems to have been in very bad voice when this CD was recorded. Hopefully this won't be a lasting condition. Maybe he had a cold. His fans don't listen to his music for the dulcet tones of his voice - they never have - but its raspy quality is particularly pronounced here, literally wiping out the lyrics at one point. This CD is for the hard-core Dylan fan, worthwhile only for \\"Roll On John\\". Mediocre Dylan cuts almost everybody else, but that's the best that can be said about all of the songs except \\"Roll On John\\".
B00785P2QC|3.0|its pretty good not anything to over obsess about. You know its just i think roller coaster tycoon is better
B00984668E|5.0|The Sword continues to put out strong records. Warp Riders didn't quite get me like the others, but this new one is packed with incredible riffs. Perfect driving music.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Love the box set. I cant wait to give it to my boyfriend for christmas. I am so sad The Complete Saga got such horrible reviews because of George Lucas' changes.  I get it but what is done is done. Don't hate on the product because of the changes Lucas did. It is still a classic and was worth every penny.
0062124293|5.0|This is the wittiest book. Who is this brilliant Caitlin Moran? You could put her book by your bedside as an inspirational tome, but you'd be laughing so hard you wouldn't get to sleep. The book is like sitting down with an extremely smart best friend who is also hilarious and filled with good advice. Give this to your best friends for Christmas.
1423136802|5.0|This book is not just for children but so intriuging for adulys aswell. Rick roordan is a finominal writer i extremely enjoyed this series followed by the lost hero series & the red pyramid series!
B009YX02T8|5.0|I actually like this one better than the Breaking Dawn Part 1 soundtrack and would put this as my #2 favorite of the 5 (number one being New Moon). Oddly enough EW loved the Green Day song and disliked the Paul/Nikki duet and I find the opposite, the Green Day song is my least favorite.
B00A131VJA|5.0|I luv this album. It is great great great. I would recommend this album to everyone.  I luv it. Yes
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Having lately been in a romance mood, I have nevertheless been struck by how many truly awful romance books there are out there. And I've definitely read my share.<br />Thankfully, this is not one of them.“Waking Up Married“ is a fun sexy romp through the pitfalls of that age old emotion, true love.<br />Connor Reed has a proposition for Megan when they meet in Vegas during one forgetful alcohol soaked night. They should get married and have it all, without the messy complication of letting love ruin it.<br />Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time...<br />Here's a hint---if your wife can't even remember your name, you might be in for a rough ride.<br />This is a funny, smart and sexy romance. If you truly love the possibility of what a good romance should be, then don't miss this one. It's not a sweeping epic, just two previously damaged people trying to stumble their way to ecstasy.<br />It does drag in a few places that almost seem to be repeating, but all in all, it's an enjoyable ride.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|I have to say I enjoyed the book very much.  Well written and in the factual cases well researched (weapons and technology).  I think the fact that it was not solely based in the USA lends to a larger world Audiences ability to relate to the characters.<br /><br />The pre-political motivation and post-political results show how nations can change after disasters as well as giving the everyday man a bit of food for thought
1599290634|5.0|Fantastic art from cover to cover. I have all volumes and this book fits in perfect with well done fantasy art of all types. Digital art, sculpture and more throughout the book. This book an investment in my education as well. There is always something new and inspiring inside the pages of these collections and art has been my passion since the early sixties. The back of the book has the contact information for finding out more about each artist - their website url if you want to satisfy the need to learn more. These are such good books I never hesitate to order them as soon as they are available and even the price is reasonable. Perhaps my art may grace one of these well done books.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love it there is no problems with it.  Its amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :-D I totaly recamend you get it.  but it adicting

B0097EWK3A|4.0|liked the free intro, the almost free continuation was really fun, too. did alot of it on the train ride home after the holidays.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln knew that winning the Civil War was not enough to stop slavery.  The 13th Amendment was needed to  \\"seal the deal.\\"  This film demonstrates his down-home folksy wisdom in playing the necessary sophisticated political game to make this happen.  There are many great intimate scenes with Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, him and his co-horts, him and his adversaries.  There are scenes where a group listens as Lincoln tells a story that at first makes no sense, but later swings round like a Zen koan with a bite.  Occasionally there are familiar shots of Lincoln in silhouette, dramatizing his historical significance;  whereas after the assassination, his dead body appears to be a simple, gentle, humorous man taking a nap.  What a gift Spielberg, Daniel Day-Lewis, et al have given us by revealing the lovely ordinariness of this extraordinary man who graced our history and continues to inspire our nation!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is a perfect sequel to Pillars of the Earth. Following the history of Kingsbridge, several generations removed from the first book, is just as captivating. Follett's writing is amazing. I could'nt put it down and was sad when the last page came.
B0087ITC56|5.0|The climaxing scene of this film (the hearing) should live as a classic.  I have never experienced a moment in which the best and the worst in a person are placed in sharper contrast.  And the moment of decision for this person's \\"soul\\" is felt in its full weight.  Denzel Washington outdoes himself as a heroic pilot who brings about an unbelievable crash landing in a virtually hopeless situation - then has to deal with his even tougher down-to-earth addiction.  This isn't an easy film to watch but totally worth it.
B008N1V11U|2.0|I was so exited when I was down loading this game.little did I know it needs like a billion Mb! R u serious. after I found this out I tried making space but it just wouldn't take it. so I deleted it.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This was one of the silliest books I've ever read.  It took me weeks to get through it, and that was simply because I don't like to leave books unfinished.....I should have.  It reminded me of some story of teenage angst that I might have read in a teen magazine just expanded when there was no reason for that expansion.  It was a total waste of time and money.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|Works fine... no problems at all.  a little flimsy so handle with care.  Does what it says it's supposed to do.
B00846REIS|5.0|Grab a blanket and a good bottle of wine. This is a great book that you'll have a hard time to put down.
1416550550|5.0|From the first of the story, a child abandoned, through all of the subsequent intertwined stories, this book grabs you and doesn't let go - you have to keep on reading.  Kate Morton paints a detailed picture that you can see played out in your mind's eye.  The title suggests vines intertwined with trees, vines,  flowers and buds - so the story unfolds, spanning years and cultures.  It challenges you to pay close attention to who, when and relationships as the story unfolds.  I will read it again to see if I missed anything!
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|This book had potential but the overly simple plot and very very poor dialogue marred this. I only finished the book because in had paid for it. Pass on this one.
1401324649|4.0|This tongue-in-cheek novel takes the reader on a Forest Gump-type journey over a long life of a 100 year old man. The quirky language works well with the quirky life, filled with coincidences and serendipitous global milestone events affected by this one particular man....<br /><br />The long-life story is interspersed with present day events that are equally weird and require the reader to suspend belief or just accept this strange world and its unlikely perspective with its colorful cast of characters. The book and the events are funny, but not the knee-slapping type.<br /><br />60% through the book I felt that it became predictable. Indeed, most events were repetitions of previous ones, with the only change being the locale and the world leader whom our Old Man met and forged yet another friendship. I would have stopped at 85%, but read to the very end, hoping that some new twist would throw the story into yet another unpredictable, quirky ending that might change the perspective of things. But that did not quite happened.<br /><br />I read the book on a beach vacation, and that's the only place where one can spend time on such a novel.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It's a good cross between strategy and hack n slash scroller.<br />I recommend this to anyone who loves to be strategic.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not to bad of a game to pass the time without having to think on it. Do not like the slow progression without spending actually money but then again its free and a mindless pass the time game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is such a fun game especialy beacause it has so many games so if you get bored of one you can play a different one.another reason is you can buy more games.also you can buy points.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love that you can play this game for just one minute, or for twenty minutes and have the same amount of fun. I like the timed trials...seeing how many boards I can clear in a certain amount if time.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Obtained as faotd, works fine on kindle fire. Fun game with beautiful graphics. Doesnt get bogged down with unsolveable silly puzzles,  everything can be solved logically and makes sense. Well worth the buck I'm looking forward to playing more.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Her songs are incredibly deft and well sung and her talent is unquestionable. My only complaint is that this album and her other cd's seem a bit over produced. If I were emperor, I'd command her to play an acoustic guitar or piano with a very light accompaniment and enjoy every minute.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I was honestly hesitant at first to buy it, but now I definitely think it's worth buying and I am glad I got it. I have two other CDs by Shinedown, but don't listen to them a whole lot any more. This one I keep going back to, and have yet to get tired of. I enjoy all of the songs on it, there aren't any I end up skipping (which is really good considering I end up doing that a lot for other artists.)
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a pocket size version of the renowned game. The &#34;world&#34; here is smaller than the PC based game but still itn gives you a nice taste of what the minecraft universe is all about ;-)
B000EWD1KK|5.0|This is my favorite Danny Kaye movie.  I don't know why I never purchased it a long time ago.  The story is funny, and it is loaded with suspense for anyone who appreciated the old light hearted thrillers.  I am happy I have finally added it to my collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is source to hours of fun for the 6 year old in the family. Can be abit tough on the little ones but still a facinating passtime.
B000FC12SM|5.0|This book was recommend by a friend, and it is great. Really good at explaining the other side view point.
B008KE3960|5.0|Good game has some pay features so far not needed to advance. The bigger screen you have the better.  Might get old fast
B00AE6SS5O|2.0|The story line is weird.  This game is geared to very young children. To me they just slopped it together to make some money on a Christmas theme and did a bad job of it. I suggest you save you money for a much better game to come along.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love playing, this is an awesome game. I have played it for months and still love it. The game pays with no bugs. Lots of fun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good fifty shadows of grey maybe but fifty shades of me too red, white, blush and many other copies!  Wow
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I am a fan of Aerosmith and have been since their start.. This album is not really anything new for me, it is to me a draw back to past stuff that has already been done by them. I still like it.. but.
0061992860|5.0|This little GEM of a book is straightforward and easy to understand.  It is a new addition to my SHTF GO-BAG.  The book in some ways is too broad in its scope which is a plus and a minus.  If I need a Survival guide and I live in North-Eastern North-America, I probably don't need the additional info about tropical plants and animals and methods of survival in the remote desert.  I would really love to see a similar book written for regions with more info specific to your needs.  But this is a comprehensive valuable book.
B009P13RQY|5.0|Another great disc from a Texas band. If you like godd metal by all means check out this band they do deliver the goods
B00881VLCE|4.0|Iv only had the app a short time and since I have two cats I can not leave small puzzle pieces anywhere. This solves the problem!tt
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I was not able to view it. I downloaded everything the error message said, but I still was not able to watch it.
B000J233SK|5.0|Scratched our old one and had to replace this favorite.  Came quickly.  My husband loves this and must keep him happy.  I enjoy it also.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I'm quite happy with this item. Not too pricey and does the job. Extra long cable means you can shoot from a distance. Not the best of mics, but it's certainly usable for web vids and such.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Got this for my little sister's birthday. Got here when predicted and great disc quality. Great gift for the musical lover.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game in the world!!!! You can build ANYTHING possible!!!!! If you don't already have it... buy it now!!!
0060555661|4.0|Being written by one of the most influential investors of the last hundred years, it came as no surprise to me that the investment advice in this book was good and quite sound. Graham takes a defensive approach to investing that encourages smart decision making, reducing risk as much as possible, and ensuring that you are getting returns throughout the good and the bad years of the stock market. To supplement grahams writing, Jason Zweig comments at the end of every chapter often explaining grahams theories and advice in a much more summarized and easy to follow manor. Zweig does a great job of modernizing grahams thoughts through the use of modern day facts and examples.<br /><br />The downside to this book is that Grahams information is outdated to a significant degree to the point where many parts of his investing strategy are irrelevant or need much revision. Grahams final version of the writing (the version in this book) is current as of the 1970's which is over 30 years ago. While many principles of the stock market and investing remain timeless, much has changed. Grahams writing doesn't take into account modern innovations such as the internet, exchange trade funds, discount brokers and changing industries. Perhaps the greatest folly relative to modern times is Grahams heavy emphasis on the investment in bonds. At the time of his writing bonds returned anywhere between 4 and 8 percent, rates which are unheard of today. Because of this much of his advice and heavy emphasis on bond investment is sorely outdated. Finally much of Grahams writing is very hard to understand if you are not already heavily knowledgeable about investing. The book was clearly written for experienced people who wish to dive deeper into investment theory and strategy. For the beginner, I would honestly recommend skipping Grahams writing and just reading Zweigs commentary.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Good investment theory and strategy for the intermediate to experienced investor<br />-Outstanding commentary by Zweig<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Grahams writing is very outdated<br />-The book is very heavy in strategy and theory to the point where it is a pretty dry read
B006LSZECO|5.0|Book was hard to put down! Really enjoyed the different view of how it played out. Will read this author again.
0345531957|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I read it a couple of days.  I hadn't read a Grisham novel in a while and suddenly I ordered four!
0307951529|5.0|Practical How To Book on How to Build a Micro Business and Redesign Your Life. \\"The Four Hour Workweek\\" by Tim Ferriss defined the category of Lifestyle Redesign in 2007 and how to build a Micro Business. In 2012 Chris takes it to the next level in his new book! Very usable step by step guide on what to do. All you need is the desire and willingness to take action. Chris provides the rest. Very inspiring!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Hey Wi-Fi People. Great app. It's about time this type of service is available to us. I can use it anywhere I go. It tells me right off if I have a positive signal. \\"You're the Best\\" Good Job, keep up the good work. I hope to see more of these ah-some products from you guys/gals.<br />Thanks so much.<br />Cheers,<br />The Harvester
0399536108|5.0|I am a big fan of \\"The 4 Hour Workweek\\" by Tim Ferriss. But I found that book to be very rigid in it's approach. Here is the modern lifestyle redesign book. Chris shows how modern lifestyle redesign junkies like myself are recreating their lives and living their dreams. Written by a man who has lived it he get's down to the nuts and bolts of how to do it. Very inspiring. This book is now a permanent reference book in my library.
B00A17AD36|4.0|This 'new' release is actually a combination of his existing albums, but it is still a good collection of work from the Weeknd.
030746363X|5.0|I picked up this book in January 2012. Since then I have lost 23lbs via the slow carb diet and gained 15lbs back via Freak 2 Geek/Occams Protocol. The results were even more impressive for my wife as she lost 43lbs via the slow carb diet. The real 'harajuka' moment with this diet was understanding what the foods do inside our body. Since I now knew what carbs to do blood sugar and how important protein is. This allowed me to make the connection and easily take the weight off.<br /><br />Once I was done losing weight putting on the muscle was harder but easier since I was never able to put on muscle. I just didn't understand the importance of protein and diet. My time at the gym has never been so efficient with measurable results.<br /><br />This book is a goldmine of information which will have a positive impact on your life. There is something for everyone here and easily the best money you can spend on yourself all year. I've spent almost a year reading and referencing this book. The positive impact it has had is incredible.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was a very good book.  The happenings in this book you will not find in any educational book but can only be found through experience.  It would be impossible to make this up.  It was a true, intriguing and genuine book written from the heart
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The was in my mine, the best movie ever. So to enjoy it in 3D once again was just outstanding, I would recommend this movie to others.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Another book by Grisham that keeps you turning the pages.  If you're a John Grisham fan you won't be disappointed.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I very much enjoyed watching this movie, and would reommend it to other for the enjoyment of all the action.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Flynn sends a secret signal to his son from the digital realm. Sam deciphers it and makes it to the Grid. There, along with Quorra and his Father, he discovers a plot by the ruler Clue. The 3 decide to escape and save the digital realm. We know a human can enter the Grid, but can a person from the Grid come across to the real world?<br /><br />This movie is incredible. It's far exceeds the 1st Tron film in every way. 2 of my favorite actors, Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner, are back and make this another memorable movie. The special effects, plot, and acting are as good as it gets. There is also plenty of action and drama. You can't miss this incredible sequel that outshines the original.
B00005JMCT|5.0|I like this movie.  It is a great addition to the rest of the series of American Pie movies. Recommend it to you.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Everyone knows what Transformers is. A sentient mechanical life form comes to Earth and gains asylum. Their planet, Cybertron was nigh destroyed in a terrible war led by Megatron, and The Fallen Prime. Optimus and his Autobot friends are on Earth trying to recover the All Spark. The all Spark gives life to any mechanical object. If Megatron gets his hands on it, he could raise an army that will destroy the Autobots, and the Earth for good. Sam is a young man who has become friends with the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime. He helps them to fight against Megatron and his Decepticons.<br /><br />In this volume Optimus discovers his former leader, Sentinel Prime, has been on the moon. After reviving him, they learn that he has created pillars that make a space bridge. Sentinel betrays the Autobots and allies himself with Megatron. They plan to bring Cybertron into Earth's orbit and rebuild it using the human race as slaves. Sam, the Autobots, and the military must stop the Decepticon's plan before humanity becomes a slave race.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. It has great special effects, acting, screenplay, and soundtrack. The action and suspense are also quite good. There is also a lot of comedy. Transformers is an excellent reboot of an old classic series. It does the original justice. It's a must see for anyone who likes to have a good time watching movies.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This was better than I thought it would be. I was able to get into the characters and loved the way the story went. I cried and cried. So beautiful. My friend who recommended it to me actually made a point to go see the places in France while on vacation. It really had an impact on her, too.
B001FB55I0|4.0|After Judgement Day, John Connor realizes that he must save his father, Kyle Reese, from the machine slave camp. He meets a lone soldier named Marcus. He has come from the past and challenges John with an impossible choice that will change the future of the human race.<br /><br />This movie is about as good as the other Terminator films. The acting is better, and the action is also on par with the others. The story in this movie is a bit less intense. I think the difference is that in the other movies, a catastrophic and Earth shattering global event is about to take place that must be avoided. This movie is more of a personal crisis for John. It's a good story, but it lacks the drama of an impending nuclear holocaust of something like that. It's still good though. The special effects, fight scenes, action, and everything else you like about Terminator is still here. It's a really good movie, you might want to check it out.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was beautiful. Great story line. Great characters. Loved the detail written into each location and reading along it felt like I was in a movie walking along witnessing everything that was going on rather than feeling like I was reading a story. Get it!!!
B0036EH40Q|5.0|There are a lot of good western films, but I think this one blows them all out of the water. The story of Wyatt Earp, his brothers, and Doc Holliday, and their battle with the Cowboy's organized crime gang is legendary. The thing that makes this movie so much better is the acting. The cast is awesome. Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Stephan Lang, Charlton Heston, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane, and Val Kilmer make this movie shine. Believe it or not, Val Kilmer plays the best part and his acting is incredible. This is probably the only role I've ever liked him in, but he plays it so darn well I would call it legendary. This film is a must see for anyone who likes a good western, drama, or action movie. Don't you dare miss this incredible film.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book really made sense to me and I enjoyed reading about each love language and figuring out which one I was and which one my husband was. It is great information to have, but it doesn't mean it is magically easy to apply to your life- but a great start! I think everyone- married or not- should read this! Why don't they teach THIS stuff in school?!?
B00003CXHJ|4.0|A Navy captain and his crew are just beginning to enjoy their leave when they get a top secret mission. A Nazi U-boat has been crippled. Their mission is to intercept it before the enemy recovers it. The goal is to obtain the enigma machine that holds the code to Nazi secret communications. If they are successful, the war could change directions.<br /><br />This is a good movie with a good cast. The story is intense and dramatic. This is a pretty good movie, but not the best. I recommend renting it before you buy it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Works with out any issues  on the Kindle Fire.<br />It has been a long time since I played an advencher game and so far this has been very fun.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|Celine is a vampire soldier. It's her job to fight the werewolves who have been hunted to near extinction. She is the adopted daughter of the Ruler of her covern, Viktor. While Viktor sleeps for several hundred years, the covern is ruled by his proxy. This vampire has betrayed his kind and is dealing with the werewolf leader, Lucian. Lucian is discovering how to create a hybrid werewolf/vampire. Michael is his subject. As Celine and Michael become closer, the war escalates. Her only choice is to awaken her father, Viktor. Viktor is pissed and personally goes to crush the werewolves and their collaborators. The only problem is, he will never accept Celine and Michael's relationship.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. In a world full of half baked horror/action movies, underworld shines brightly. A great cast, story, and awesome intensity shoot this film to the top of it's respective genre. Don't you dare miss it.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Thank you so much for helping me w/ another piece of my collection and i am so going to recommend you and the product
B000FGGE68|4.0|Violet is caught in a war between the government and a sub-culture of disease modified human in whose speed, strength, and intelligence are greater than normal. She encounters a boy that holds the key to the future of humanity. The powers that be will stop at nothing to retain him. Violet must protect him to change the future.<br /><br />This is a non-stop thrill ride with a great cast and special effects to boot. I really enjoyed it. Milla Jovovich is her usual badassed self. If you've seen the Resident Evil movies, then you know what to expect. This is a memorable film that any Sci-fi or action movie film can appreciate.
B009329Y30|2.0|The acting is not so good.  The story is sweet and is a fine movie if you don't expect much from the acting.
B002O3Z50Q|4.0|Achilles, the legendary warrior leads a Greek army in the siege of Troy. It's said that Troy's walls are nigh impenetrable. That's not true. Anything that is made can be destroyed. Be it walls, armies, allies, love, and even a legendary warrior. This film portrays the rise and fall of a great city, a great warrior, and a great love.<br /><br />This is a pretty good movie in the tradition of Braveheart, and Gladiator; but it's not as good as either. The acting is very good. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Brendan Gleeson, and Sean Bean are excellent in their respective role. The 2 problems I find with this story ; Orlando Bloom's wimpy character, and the lack of emotion. This story tried to invoke some emotions, but only did it half-way. The same can be said for Orlando Bloom's acting. I'm not a fan of his, but this is his worst role ever. Other than those 2 details, this is a very entertaining movie; it's definitely worth watching.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has mastered the art of creating a hero that's easy to love by anyone living in today's world and the reality terrorism plays in it.  He also does a great job of introducing longstanding series characters to new readers without boring those of us that have read the whole thing.  The only thing he leaves us wondering is - when is the next book coming out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The first time I played this was on my friend's iPad. I found that this game runs just as smoothly on the kindle fire as it did on the iPad. Great game for wasting time. :)
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This was a comedy hidden in an action movie.  The dialog was a constant steam of one-liners and incredibly funny references to all of the star's other movies.  I would love to see some movie criric catalog all of the movie refernences used and write a complete list.  You could make a movie trivia game from this movie's dialog.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Everypony will love this game. All your favorite ponies are here and lots to do. I just cannot figure out how to add friends or visit random places.... please add me obiwankenpony
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|When you have absolutely nothing better to do this is a mindless, stressless, activity.  I recommend it. . I also agree that the regeneration of coins is slower then perfect.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|I love it!<br />Even though without the participation of Roger Waters, it is another fantastic Pink Floyd work.<br />David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright left nothing behind.<br />Just the track &#34;Marooned&#34;, instrumental, is enough to make it a great Pink Floyd cd.
0307277887|5.0|Love the idea!! Very interesting, i am excited to read the rest of the books in the series! very good
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele did a great job showing powerful vocals and lyrics. Nice collection of songs.<br />Also, very nice work done by the background vocalists and musicians.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the app. Its lots of fun! I play every chance I get. I play on the bus, in the breakroom @ work, even get in a game before bedtime.
B00013F38K|5.0|Fantastic back in time memories!<br />The complete first Kung Fu season is full of action and Philosophies of life.<br />A must have for old times sakes!
1597801585|4.0|A very well thought out book niche. It could not be more timely, though the eventual revelations are rather familiar. This prospective future genre draws on two major current cultural fashions, mashes them up, and adds a Blade Runner style thriller. While a very entertaining read, it's an obvious concoction.  The story is on a par with the style of Neal Stephenson.<br />Enjoy!
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Three cd's of fantastic music!<br />Vangelis did it again.<br />These cd's will bring the movie back to your mind.<br />I love it.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|Good to watch, think outside the box. Couldn't figure out the end. Which I liked. With be one of my favorites.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|This is a cd that you can listen to everyday!<br />It never gets boring.<br />One of the best Pink Floyd.
B0072OFM28|4.0|I loved the first season, partly because of the strange dialogue style. But like most I wondered how theyd get past the death of the star. They just ignored it, basically, like costanza going back to work after he quit, and it was no problem. Worth watching.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|A classic! Harrison Ford.<br />It is Indiana Jones. What else is needed to be said?<br />It still a great movie, just as it was time ago.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is one of the BEST Christmas movies. I look forward to watching this every Christmas. It's such a touching movie & I don't understand how anybody couldn't like it......<3 love.it.so.much.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my little cus loves My little pony and she is in love with this game.I just wish that everytime u leveled up u would also get gems.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very enjoyable. It kept me up late. Even though you know there is a twist coming, you are still surprised
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This series is so awesome. From minute one of episode one of season one I have been hooked. The DVD was delivered in it's original package and I have had no problems and have enjoyed watching.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|This compilation have the best of the Soundgarden, definitely.<br />The best songs and the best videos to us is simply awesome.<br />That versions of this songs at live is something We might just have to listen.<br />We, that like the story of this great band. Beautiful Soundgarden!
0446580848|2.0|I have read every DeMille book so I think I qualify as a fan. That said, this book felt like he was \\"mailing it in.\\" I don't know if DeMille had a contract to fulfill, but it really felt that way. The John Corey internal dialogue got old quickly, but more importantly that plot just dragged and dragged. Eventually, i.e. the last 50 pages or so, it got interesting and exciting, but the first 4/5 of the book were a drag. Save your money and your time. You're not missing anything by skipping this one.<br />I'm sure I'll buy the next DeMille book, but I hope he writes his next one when he actually has something to say.
B00968TI64|3.0|EXCELLENT music but poor Hoffman remaster!!!! Once again - bummer! Soundstage pretty narrow, Lows non existent, vocal is coming from \\"behind the curtains\\" and impossible to pin point on my high end tube Cary system.
B007OWG3LM|4.0|I only had to know SR had a new cd out to buy it! But I did in fact listen on Youtube to this one first. I love Varub (&#34;Warning&#34;)the best. The use of the children's choir is haunting..reminds me a little of the  song 'Daniel in the Sea' on Jonsi & Alex album (Jonsi is lead singer of Sigur Ros. & Alex is his boyfriend) I'd recommend it to everyone.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Muddy Waters, his band, Junior Wells, Buddy Guy all in top form. Mick Jagger never sang better than when was standing next to Muddy Waters.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm still reading A Clash of Kings, but is better more rich in drama, more depth in cunning, Martin makes a really better work than in the first part.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Just got this knife in the mail, and could have been more impressed. It was exactly what I was looking for since i was looking for a sturdy knife to strap to my pack. The knife is solidly built. I was quick to field test it on a tree out side and it held up well. The knife came sharp, and i cant really complain about the sheath since ill be strapping this large one on my pack. I was going to get the Bear Grylls but decided on this one last min. The knife gods were shining down. This knife is SOLID!!!!!
0374203032|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book, for within, Sandel artfully discusses the moral ramifications of applying market principles and values to non-market areas. He masterfully articulates what, I believe, many who share his opinion feel, but can't quite put into words when it comes to the proliferation of market ideals. That said, what really sells the book for me is the conversational tone he takes on through the whole work; when I read this, it almost feels like a long conversation with a particularly knowledgeable friend, and that makes it all the more accessible of a book, even for those of us without any substantive background in economics.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i got this app and absolutely love it  it works wonderful especially when i do my checkbook.  the numbers are the right size  best app yet
B005LAIGN2|3.0|Good Video....but far too predictable.....almost completely CGA....Very easy to figure out what the next scene will bring...I Love Aviation History...but this movie drags....
B00004XMTC|3.0|I'm not going to comment on the film itself because there would be much better reviews! Honestly the fact that the cover was faded is not a big deal as I just wanted to play the movie, but it was disappointing not to have the defect noted in the 'new' description, when I ordered it. I think a collector would not be happy because the VHS looked as though it had been a storefront display with classic sun fading (read - wierd pinkish hue). But then, are people collecting VHS anyway?
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie; probably because of the Cast.....I am waiting for someone to produce the &#34;Ant&#34; People....that American Indians fought and killed in the 19th century.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is a great read. Tina Fey is self-effacing and insightful. One of the smartest and funniest books I've read by one of the smartest and funniest woman alive.

B009VSW15Y|1.0|You don't need this app to access the camera on your Kindle Fire HD. Camera can be accessed without the paid app for taking basic pictures using the front-facing camera:<br /><br />- On the home screen, select \\"Photos\\" from top menu (slide that menu line right to left in portrait mode, Photos appears between Web and Docs).<br /><br />- On the \\"Photos\\" screen, you will see a camera icon at top-right of your screen. Select that camera icon.<br /><br />- On the camera screen, you will see a shutter icon across the long-edge of the screen (on the side where the front-facing camera is located). Click that shutter icon when you are ready to take a picture using the front-facing camera.<br /><br />- To view pictures taken using the camera from home screen, select Photos from home screen and click on the folder named Camera.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B00AE2I4B6|5.0|Watch the preview.  If you like it, you'll like the movie.  The movie is basically a series of dance numbers strung together by a loose corporate greed and teen love storyline.  The narrative is throw-away, but the dancing is excellent.  My teen kids really liked the dancing and music - so much so that they watched it again the following morning.<br /><br />Amazon instant video worked perfectly through my PS3.  Excellent high-def picture and 5.1 sound.  No lagging, no hiccups or hesitations.  Perfect.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|last time i check Ultraviolet movie's can be downloaded in Itunes and runs just as a good. Heaven forbid They don't spend more and not throw in a direct Itunes redeem code and some1 have to Google one or two extra steps to, legally, have the movie on the Ipod/pad. Better get used to it cause from what I read Ultraviolet is loved by the movie companies and not going anywhere. The Alternative is to have a super DRM copy of the movie like what came with the Avengers.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Such a simple concept, but really does give you the same rush as playing in the midway.  Also love the extra prizes and puzzle aspect.  Gives a bit more goal orientation.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Was glad to see Ana finally had an impact on his domineering character, although his childhood was horrendous and I'm surprised he wasn't a sociopath!  Ana is a nimwit, but one redeeming quality was the scene with Mrs. Robinson.  Loved that interaction!!

B000FC13MM|5.0|Sabriel is my favorite book! The world Garth Nix created is vivid, terrifying, and beautiful. He wove a narrative that will draw the reader in with page turning action, a rich world history, and memorable characters. I have introduced many friends, relatives, and acquaintances to Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom, starting with this novel.<br /><br />Sabriel is the first in this series. Sabriel is a young girl finishing school in Ancelstierre. A spirit summons her to her father's side where he has been trapped in Death. He usually navigates Death with relative safety as he is the Abhorsen- one with the ability to weave Free Magic and Charter Magic to keep the dead in Death and the living far from the tricky Precincts. But something has gone terribly wrong. With the help of a few allies, Sabriel must undertake the task of rescuing her father from Death and defeating a Greater Dead from unleashing evil into both the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre.<br /><br />If you like your fantasy to include a fully developed magic system, well rounded characters, interesting histories of magic and life, and gripping action, then this series is for you. Sabriel delivers it all and is completed with a snarky companion, a slightly romantic interest, lots of suspense, and enough detail to pull you into the story and keep you there through Lirael and Abhorsen, the 2nd and 3rd novels in this trilogy. A few short stories in this setting are available and the author has announced plans for 2 more novels coming out in the future to finally finish the entire story. Happy reading!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn keeps growing this franchise, and the orientation here is a little different after Rapp gets hurt and others have to step in. The interplay between characters is well thought out (as usual). Another winner for Rapp and Flynn. I enjoy it every time a new book hits the stands. Thanks Vince.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|H<br />Just like the Fall of Giants , this book has you in its grip from the beginning. A great read. Really looking forward to the next installment.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|good but sound on kindle not great.  I listen most all of my music on my ipod connected to my in house speaker system
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The storyline does not make any sense. The movie is lacking in plot. So-so acting. Extremely violent. I never saw the first movie. I was excited that these guys were getting together to make this movie. Unfortunately, my excitement died down after the first ten minutes. And I lost interest in this movie. Thumbs down!
B006KX3GXO|1.0|when I got it, it looked cool, but when I started to do it,acted retarded so if I were u I wouldn't get it!!!!good luck.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Good mindless escape!  Story line is better than first chapter.  Action and stunt filled for the entire two hours of the movie.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome because its free and u can go so far In it. so many animals and u can get somany coins and acorns
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A big fan of Follett, I was somewhat disappointed in Winter of the World.  As the sequel to Fall of Giants, it faithfully followed the families and characters introduced in the first book, but seemed to fall short of all the historical detail that has become Follett's signature.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book as much as book one and three of this trilogy. It was just a wonderful read and I highly recommend it. It made me laugh, cry and absolutely love the characters for the way the are portraied.
B0024CEY36|3.0|This is one of his earlier efforts.  Generally, his skills improved over his career.  This book keeps your attention, is full of historical facts, but the ending is not all that realistic.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I have been addicted to the book series on which this show is based. Wonderfully acted, vivid story and characters not to mention the amazing fight scenes! A must-watch for any fantasy fans!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The main character tells the story in the first person.  He is a black lawyer who is now in prison for a white collar crime, which he did not commit.  He becomes the jailhouse lawyer and is frequently visited by inmates who want their lives made easier.  During his interment, a federal judge is murdered along with his girlfriend.  Because of his knowledge of inmates lives, he knows who did it, and makes a deal with the feds to be released and placed in witness protection.<br />Once out, he begins a new bogus life as a film director, and tracks down a man whose brother was gunned down in a DEA action.  He convinces the guy that he is doing a documentary on corrupt police practices and wants the details of his brother's killing.  This is where the readers attention becomes muddled.  The man foolishly trusts Malcolm, and the rest of his life does not go well.<br />In the last 20 pages, you'll discover that Malcolm knew a lot more than he has let on.  All the pieces drop into place and they inlclude a judicial corruption, a payoff, and a political comment regarding the the leanings of the judicial system.
0547884591|4.0|Overall enjoyed the book,  learnt some great concepts but do have some reservations.<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />- Tim Ferriss' approach to learning anything - quite revolutionary, could change the face of traditional education if it catches on! Will be using it myself.<br />- An easy to read, story-telling approach makes it an enjoyable read.<br />- Teaches you lots and lots of excellent lessons about cooking, covering all sorts of things most chefs, cooks and books assume you just know. I finished with the impression that Ferriss had really done his home work, and thought carefully about delivering a book through which the skill of cooking is taught so that it didn't just replicate what was already out there. It taught me a lot of things about food and cooking that I didn't know and have already found these useful.<br /><br />Not-so-good points:<br /><br />- I really enjoyed 4 Hour Work Week, read it several times and used several of the concepts. 4HR Chef is not his finest work, I can't see myself coming back to dip into the 4HR Chef.<br /><br />- Large sections of the 4HR Chef just didn't click with me. I'm sure it did though with its target market - if you are male between the ages of 25 and 45 and American then you'll probably love the sections I didn't.  If you live outside the USA, many of the references to food and places leave you out of the story.  As a woman, I felt much of the narrative and many of the lessons come across as a 'lad' on a Boy's Own Adventure.<br /><br />Overall, great value for money and not a purchase I regret but didn't hold the magic for me.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I am using this microphone with a Behringer 802 mixer and could not be happier. I originally bought a microphone locally for about the same price and this Behringer sounds tons better. Very solid and sound is very clear. I dont think you could find a better one at this price. Don't forget to buy the microphone cable as it is not included. The microphone itself comes in a nice padded storage box and includes a mic holder. No off button which is not a problem for me.
1465001107|5.0|I like the calendar, because it has concert scene still photos which is nice and they are pictures that I have not seen published anywhere eles before.  I like the wide date boxes so that you can note appointments, of course, I would not deface my calendar with that, but you can do that because the squares are large enough with large numbers.  Well worth having.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Once you've seen the whole movie, you get how they were able to cast so many stars. Very cute, artistic, charming and perfectly charming.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a Massachusetts resident and a neighbor of a Massachusetts chief prosecuting attorney this book had a special<br />significance.  Much discussion of this book by many people who read it and discussed with me before book club discussion.  Predictable yet unpredictable ending.  Interesting look into the psyche of parents and their inability to see reality until too........<br />Read it.
B001RP1G0U|1.0|I loved Diane Lane in \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" but this movie was terrible.  The story line was dull and the acting was like kindergarten! I couldn't even watch the entire movie! Please save your money!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Made my think about my own life and what I have accomplished by going outside of the area that I was raised.  Also my goals for education were accomplished not by encouragement but by my own commitment to  his dream<br />The setbacks were only temporary for the alchemist who had a dream and a quasi  mentor who he kept always in his vision although i believe he could have accomplished anything he set out to do.  Inspirational for young and old.  Recommend<br />without reservation

B008FWHUQM|3.0|I lime the cast and the acting was pretty good, but the movie was predictable and just average at best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book... only downloaded it for a book report and fell in love. Recommended for  everyone who has a taste for adventure with a little romance to make u feel something inside.
B0065FFMR0|5.0|I have just finished watching Season 1 on Amazon prime through [[ASIN:B005CLPP8E Roku 2 XD Streaming Player 1080p]] (5 stars for both of those too).  Like a well written book and a can of pringles, you cannot watch just one episode.<br /><br />This single series horror serial has everything - mystery, despair, love, family dysfunction, loss, redemption (of sorts), humor - yes there are parts that I laughed out loud, sex, surprise, and of course . . . horror (some of it of the bloody, depraved kind).<br /><br />What is wonderful about this series?  Everything - the dialogue, the plot - even though the haunted house thing has been done - pun intended - to death, the acting, the cinematography, lighting, camera angles . . . and the ACTING.  Every single role in this series is well acted.  Jessica Lange is crazy good, literally.<br /><br />I do not generally like zombie like horror (too predictable), \\"blood and guts gore\\" or \\"stupid blonde\\" horror flicks - unless they are so stupid they are funny (e.g. [[ASIN:B0026ZH1CC Scary Movie 4]] or [[ASIN:B000ICXQOM Army of Darkness]]).<br /><br />I also do not like the \\"running camera\\" theory of cinematography with a lot of jiggling and movement.  There is some of that here - just enough.  There is some first person framing, and some very traditional horror angle framing.  In my view, all of it was just enough and not too much.<br /><br />Some reviewers faulted the series for the sex.  Yes, there is simulated sex in this series (no nudity), but really, nothing even close to [[ASIN:B008CLI4N4 Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season]] and to me, it relates to theme - there is a man vs. woman theme in this series.  The main male character has committed adultery, and is trying to reconcile with his wife.  So, as the various ghosts come on to him, and he \\"sees\\"the sex, it is necessary for writers to get these points home visually.  All of these scenes are relatively short, and relate to internal failings of the male character, or the \\"young love\\" between the teenagers.<br /><br />What is particularly surprising here is the ability to take this somewhat overdone horror genre that is fairly predictable (which probably started before [[ASIN:079284677X The Amityville Horror (Widescreen/Full Screen)]] but that is the one I recall most vividly), and make it interesting.<br /><br />There are a few oddities - for example, the main young male character killed 15 kids at his school (note to those who were critical of the gore aspect, none of the actual kill shots are shown), and some of those kids come back to haunt him, even though they did not die in the house.  These gnawing questions that sometimes drive me nuts were not enough to detract from a core cohesive theme.<br /><br />If you enjoy very, very good acting, an interesting story, a lot of surprises, and can stand some gore and sex, this is absolutely a not to be missed series. (so is the second season).<br /><br />- mikethe \\"young love\\" between the teenagers.<br /><br />What is particularly surprising here is the ability to take this somewhat overdone horror genre that is fairly predictable (which probably started before [[ASIN:079284677X The Amityville Horror (Widescreen/Full Screen)]] but that is the one I recall most vividly), and make it interesting.<br /><br />There are a few oddities - for example, the main young male character killed 15 kids at his school (note to those who were critical of the gore aspect, none of the actual kill shots are shown), and some of those kids come back to haunt him, even though they did not die in the house.

1609611543|5.0|This book has more important health information than any single book I have ever read.<br /><br />It covers the numerous and varied damaging health effects of wheat consumption on every body system. It is FAR more than a weight loss book or low carb diet even though those issues are covered.<br /><br />Every chapter reveals the almost shocking damage done by wheat, not just to the overtly celiac disease sufferer, but to just about anyone who consumes wheat or gluten in any form. I have been off of gluten for about a year and am having signifiocant health improvements of very long standing problems.<br /><br />I highly and emphatically recommend this book for everyone..even if you feel that gluten is not an issue for you.<br /><br />Wheat is an issue, to some degree, for everyone... and certainly for some of our family members and friends. It seems daunting and impossible to imaging giving up wheat but this book will provide the motivation to consider doing so.<br /><br />If you had a peanut allergy, for example, you wouldn't think twice about avoiding peanuts. Once you know the health consequences of wheat, you may see it in a similar light.<br /><br />William Davis is an excellent writer and gives enough background to have a clear picture of the particular issues concerning wheat. It is so much more than just the carbohydrate response. My suggestion is to go off wheat for 30 or 60 days and see what happems, see which of you chronic health problems begin to go away.<br /><br />If your mind is open, this book will change your life.
0446547654|5.0|I have not yet read this book but I am sure that like all of the other Nicholas Sparks' books that I have read, it will be wonderful.  For a used book, it came to me in excellent condition
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is what a super hero movie should be. Action, adventure, great characters, humor and visually amazing. I could watch this again and again.
0446698326|5.0|This book was wonderful just like all of the other Nicholas Sparks' books that I have read.  For a used book, it came to me in excellent condition.
0385344333|2.0|Have to agree with a lot of other reviewers, this is the worst book of the Reacher series. Plot was dull, pointless and meandering. After finishing previous chapters I almost didn't finish the book when it reached the end. After plodding through this book and entire chapters on such thrilling topics as looking for a car and walking up a driveway, I couldn't take the long, boring narrative and description of the building interior.<br /><br />Anyway, have to give Mr. Child a pass on this one. Everyone is allowed a dud now and then and it's still my favorite character ever. Just hope the next book is a lot better.
0810996596|5.0|The first thing I noticed when I received my copy was just how nice it was, it has a very \\"classic\\" feel to the cover and it represented with alot of thought to detail and presentation.  It has a nice thick binding and was quite sturdy which is appreciated when you have an image heavy book with heavy slick pages. I hate when the binding is poor and your book basically breaks open and tends to flop as your pacing through the pages. I have not had any issues with the pages sticking as one of the other reviewers had, and I have read through the entire book so not every printing has that issue I am happy to report.<br /><br />Kirk's collection is broken up into genre (toys, posters, art etc.) and by the decade.  They are represented quite well, great photos and each has a comment from Kirk himself about either how he came across the piece, its rarity or personal thoughts.  There were alot of pieces that I had never seen before and as a horror fan myself, that was a real treat.  It also introduced me to some classic films I have somehow missed along the way and alot of toys that I've never seen.<br /><br />The interview with Kirk was a great edition, he talks about how he became an avid lover and collector of all things horror, why he is drawn to a particular decade or monster and his favorites, he also ties it into his music as well; you get to see all the guitars he had designed based on his favorite monster films.<br /><br />This is a very nice book, you do not have to be a fan of Kirk's or Metallica's to enjoy this at all, as a matter of fact, this is about the other love in Kirk's life: Horror Business.  So I would recommend this to a horror fan, a book lover, a collector of classic films and tv monsters.  I was quite impressed with it overall.
B009MF56GC|3.0|I ordered this movie not seen thinking it was going to be as good as the original but it seemed a lil video gameish with all of the blood squirting out of everyone they shoot and no matter how many people fire at them seems no one ever dies? Chuck Norris appears like the next messiah in this, kind corny. 3 out of 5 for E2.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Always enjoy a good reacher novel.  Always a good read, great good guy, suspenseful and leaves you wanting to read another one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Honestly this book wasnt what I expected at all. In a good way. Ive never read a story quite like this one and i was pretty taken back by it. At first i was a little confused about the settings and plot but then as i continued...it go better! There were moments where the book tugged at my heart and moments where i wanted to slap both of the main characters but there was a happy ending.<br /><br />Megan the main girl, has been burned too many times by guys has sworn off of them and wants ti start a family so her only option is to go to a sperm donor for a baby.<br /><br />Connor wants a family as well but he has a love phobia...hes afraid of falling in love but wants the family package.<br /><br />Of course after way too many drinks these two get married...Megan wakes up wants a divorce but then Connor says \\"No we're perfect for eachother\\"<br /><br />Megan tries to fend him off but he keeps trying to make her stay in the marriage.<br /><br />When Megan finally gives into the marraige and agrees to try and make things work out....Connor finds out that shes getting attatched to him and so he starts being an ass towards her.<br />And the rest? Youll have to read to find out!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Kept me on the edge all the way through. Very descriptive through the scenery, through the torture.  Raw fear could eventually smell the pines.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I was trying to learn how to post an e book  to Amazon for kindle .  I needed this book for reference<br />to step by step find my way to KDP .  I found the book very helpful but decided to get a professional<br />publisher to insure  it download properly to kindle.  sometimes trying to do things a cheaper way is<br />not always the best way.  you have to be very computer savey to do the job right.  This book was<br />exactly what you read on the amazon KDP web pages.
B00A7ZXH4O|2.0|Rihanna has allowed the downhill decline of moral common sense amongst America to change her as well. She has the type of sound to be the pied piper of young people. Her songs such as &#34;We all need love&#34; and &#34;diamond&#34; lead people to what we are meant to be. Then she sings garbage. Sad. Very sad.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it kept on like messing up and i really didnt see the point of this game but ok i can see it for little kids not for me...
B0073LWEXK|4.0|great game without Cheats it can be beaten this is not always the Case with these click adventures. I did enjoy the puzzles and I world buy another game from this developer.

0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is a girl that grits her teeth and does what she has to, even if that means going into death and finding her dad. She seems to treat everything like a good student and never complains. The world that she lives in feels real. And who doesn't appreciate banter with a little white cat? Her journey is really exciting and flows really well and the ending is satisfying. I highly reccomend it, it is part of one of my favourite series along with Harry Potter, Jonothan Strange & Mr. Norrel, The Narnia Books and His Dark Materials series.
141659521X|5.0|Great action compelling plot.  Did not want to put it down and finished it too quickly.  Highly recommended for readers of this genre.
B005SFS4ZU|2.0|I have seen three theatrical versions of Phantom and own two scores and the movie.  I wouldn't even put this version in the same league with the others.  Here is why:<br /><br />1) The theatrical version itself was poor - no trap doors, the chandelier didn't fall, no moving and sliding walkways, the underground lake and the cemetary were done with large screen TV.  Many of the trapdoor exits and entrances were just done by actors leaving via the stairs.  The whole point is that Erik, the Phantom, built in trap doors, and secret passages all over the Paris opera house and that is how he gets around.  The phantom doesn't use the front door or the stairs.<br />2) The orchestra was on a riser in the middle of the stage so that some of the action was below the orchestra and some above.  The area above the orchestra was sometimes used for high action and sometimes with close ups of the actors.  Very distracting.  In some cases, the phantom was singing just above the orchestra and the conductor is busy waiving his baton around just below the actors knees.<br />3) The musicality was broken up repeatedly.  In the name of more emotionality, the rythm was repeatedly broken so the actor or actress could scream or cry or get a crazy look on their face.  Its a musical.  The music carries the emotional content, not by people looking crazy.<br />4) The musical climax was totally botched.  The musical climax of the piece is \\"past the point of no return\\", where the Phantom murders the lead and takes his place.  In this piece the phantom must be soooooo seductive that the police just watch him and Christine goes with him willingly.  This phantom was covered in black the whole time, Christine was playing a wanton milkmaid rather than an elegant engenue and there was very little seductive quality.  Compare the Gerard Butler version or any of the live versions I have seen and this one is just ho-hum.  Part of the problem is that the Phantom's voice must be far and above Piangi's in powerand quality or he can't be percieved as sexy in this scene.<br />5) Some really goofy non-sequiters.  In the final scene, the phantom lights a candle and then uses it to instantly cut a heavy lasso. Huh?  In the abduction scene, the phantom is surrounded by police and Raul is pointing a pistol at him, but no one is on the stairs, so he just leaves with Christine.  We are going to surround the phantom on all sides EXCEPT THE STAIRS?  Then, Cristine is abducted in a milkmaid outfit, but somehow changes into a wedding gown complete with a bustle and immense bow above her butt by the final scene.  So the phantom let her stop by the dressing room for a change of outfit?  We wouldn't want to be inappropriately dressed for an abduction would we?  Finally, what is with the milkmaid outfit anyway for the \\"past the point of no return?\\"  This scene is lifted right out of Don Giovanni (Italian for Don Juan), by Mozart.  Don Juan is a nobleman.  He'll do it with anyone but he doesn't make elaborate plans to seduce milkmaids - he was seducing a noblewoman, Donna Anna.  This is the only version I have seen with Christine dressed as a peasant.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game.  Very easy at first and gets progressively more difficult.  Because each puzzle stands alone and typically takes less than a couple of minutes this is a great game to start when you are in a waiting room and don't know how long you will have to play.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Deadwood set in a sudo-fantasy setting. Not much (no) magic but great fun, dialog that leaves a interesting aftertaste, and action that down low and dirty. The guy you've been waiting for is back too.
B007NCSQFO|1.0|The album is not worth the $3.99 or space on your memory. YM should give Scooby n Shaggy a deal and send the two acts on tour in the Mystery Machine. I'm hoping these characters can find out who stole hip hop.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Sure, I'd like to make fun of 50 Shades of Grey but in fact, I read the first two books and I liked them. Well, I liked the first one at least. And like everyone, I wished the writing were better. So when I saw this series was billed as 50 Shades of Better Writing, I figured, why not? And the first book is a lot like 50, except the writing and dialogue are indeed much better. I bought the second book. And from there, things quickly fell apart.<br /><br />Let's back up a bit. This is the continuing story of Eva Tramell, a sexual abuse survivor, and her billionaire boyfriend, Gideon Cross (Ridiculous soap opera names? Check. Young billionaire stud? Check, check.) They fall into a relationship despite having some serious baggage. For instance, Gideon trying to choke and rape Eva in his sleep sort of baggage. In this book, they are trying to keep their relationship afloat by going to therapy and having lots of sex, while Eva pesters Gideon incessantly to discuss his issues.<br /><br />Look, I know the sex is the main attraction and I can't believe I'm saying this but there is either TOO much sex in this book or, I just don't like the way Day writes about it. I get that Eva and Gideon are way into each other, but Eva worships his man parts like she's fallen into a primitive fertility cult. And the second thing is, these people are just too profoundly messed up and their relationship is vastly unhealthy. I got to the point where Gideon punished Eva with sex as a teaching moment and felt physically ill and just could not forge onward. These two don't need to headline a romance novel, they need to break up, go to therapy alone and keep their pants on for a while. 50 Shades may not have elegant writing, but I ended up caring a great deal more about Ana and Christian in the end.<br /><br />Finally, Gideon's propensity for continuously calling Eva \\"Angel\\" just got on my nerves. No one speaks like this. But I did like the first book so if you are curious about this series, I suggest you both start and stop there.
B007N31Z06|4.0|this movie is crazy, but a good one.  the things that went on then could not be allowed anymore, but this is a good show of the frat days.  shows why I did not even bother to apply for any of the frat.s It looks like this shows, even if fictitious, that sometimes, what goes around comes around.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I spend a lot of time playing this game when I want to relax.  I would recommend this to anyone.
0525953728|1.0|Matt Bissonnette is the Judas of the US military.  By writing this book without clearance, Matt Bissonnette sold out his comrades, his service and his country for cash.  In the process, he did harm to the United States, including contradicting the carefully crafted story of OBL's demise.  Don't spend your money on this book, or any book by such a dishonorable self-promoter.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I like that I can watch when it's convienient for me and that I can rewind or rewatch to catch little bits that I might miss or forget.

B00005N6KG|4.0|These are excellent headphones, especially for the money.  One little glitch...the cord is relatively short.  I bought an extention cord, and I use the headphones all the time.  Great sound.

B0073LWEXK|1.0|Game will only do the intro and then returns to the app section of the kindle fire HD 8.9.  This app should be noted that it cannot be played on the fire.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has been an excellent option for my Kindle Fire. It's a very useful app.  Also I have installed the same app in other tablets and I have been satisfied with its efficiency too.
0061474355|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was 11 years old. I was a bookish preteen with no friends, bullied and unhappy at school, who sought escape in the only place that offered any: books. I loved action and adventure and fantasy and scifi. But something was really missing from the books I read at the time. All the heroes were boys, and for a young girl it was a little disheartening to never seen a real female heroine that I could connect with. I didn't want to be a princess, I wanted to have a sword and fight monsters, and none of the books I was finding in the library seemed to offer this.<br /><br />And then I came across Sabriel.<br /><br />Sabriel was everything I wanted and needed as a young reader; she was brave, loyal, intelligent, and strong. But she was also an outsider, lonely, and awkward. She had failings and bad moments as much as she was amazing, and I think best of all, her gender was never made an issue or forced as a selling point. Reading Sabriel when I was 11 made me feel like I wasn't alone, that girls could be heroes and that I wasn't weird for liking \\"boy\\" books. She was also a fantastic role model: a woman who takes charge of her life and the safety of her friends and family, who doesn't shy away from the scary things in life and who accepts herself for who she is, and lets others do the same. Sabriel was, and is, a fantastic character, and an amazing book.<br /><br />I'm 25 now, and Sabriel still gets a reread every year. Each time I read it I come away with a different interpretation of the characters. It's a book that grows on you, and grows with you. I've had and loaned and lost multiple copies since I was a kid, and I always buy another one. Whatever your gender or your age, Sabriel stands as one of the best YA books out there. I highly suggest you give it a read.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have now read about 70% of this book and I'm disappointed I  am a John Grisham fan but not of this book I doesn't flow is rambles on and on.  If you like a good entertaining read I would not recommend this book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was in the miltiary during VietNam, so I really enjoyed seeing how things are done now days, plus it was nice to hear the real story, written very well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Oh my goodness. This game is incredibly addictive!!! I play this game every day. So many levels, its great!!!<br />Stay awesome,<br />Hawkflight of RiverClan
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|I like hidden object games and Christmas so with this game I have both the things I like. Not a hard game but fun to play.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read based upon sheer popularity and enjoyed throughout.  Believable hero and heroine for the age.  Content somewhat gritty for younger people.
034580404X|4.0|Really good trilogy. My face was buried in these pages for DAYS!  You can't read one without reading all three!!
0385344333|2.0|Usually, I love Jack Reacher books, but I notice a pattern, where some seem merely space-fillers between books that work much better.  This book seems manufactured to fill that space, but without any real substance.  The plot is misplaced.  The clues are misdirections.  And the characters are fabricated so that we might care about where this is going, but there is nothing of importance at its core.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|I enjoyed reading this unusual book. Such fun to imagine this man having such an interesting life.  His philosophical outlook on his experiences - good and bad - and his low-key, droll humour make this book a pleasure to read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Nice game. Appears only slightly limited<br />Several vaeiations means it will take a long time to play them all once.
B007T9FRFS|5.0|If you loved the others, you'll love this one.<br />Stay in, put the blanket on and get stuck in - Don't forget to leave the lights on.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Section one read like an Encyclopedia and was touch to gain interest in. The story picked up dramatically in part two. It was hard to put down and wove a story of courage and bravery, of intelligence and reason, of survival against all odds, and of God's grace and mercy. Richard Parker is perhaps the best character of any story I've read.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|thx for this its great but i dont know what else to say too many words. ok ok ok ok..
0316228532|2.0|I didn't get past 95 pages. It went absolutely no where, slowly. I was very disappointed. The people in the book just did'nt have any action for lack of other words
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|thx for this its great but i dont know what else to say too many words. ok ok ok ok..
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I thought that this was a great buy. Shipped quickly. Nice product with all media formats. DVD, and digital download.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|thx for this its great but i dont know what else to say too many words. ok ok ok ok..
0061474355|5.0|I have to say that I am pretty picky when it comes to books, but Sabriel, (and the whole series) is a truly wonderful read. Sabriel is a wonderful and strong female lead and I think really very unique! Nix did a wonderful job making her relateable while still making her a kick ass anti-necromancer (which by the way if you, like me, ever dress as Sabriel for Halloween, expect to get really weird looks at the world \\"necromancer\\" or \\"abhorsen\\" ). The whole lore behind the magic in the world of the Abhorsen series is so wonderful and rich and unique! There is true depth there and that is what makes a wonderful story. Even the secondary chars like Mogget are wonderful!<br /><br />I have to admit at first i was very sad to see that the other 2 books were not about Sabriel, but after giving them a chance, i found those stories to be just as amazing!<br /><br />The book itself is not very long but I think it says a lot when an author can do more with fewer words. The only other fantasy series that I would rate above this is The Earthsea Cycle... and to say it's a close second is saying a lot from me.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|thx for this its great but i dont know what else to say too many words. ok ok ok ok..
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Excellent Movie. One of the best from Marvel. I would recommend this Movie for anybody that likes the Action Movies from Marvel.

B004LROUNG|5.0|I had not read a John Grisham book for a while and he did not disappoint me at all. I was thrilled to read this book and get caught up in his world of law and lawyers.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I would next time get it durring preorder, alot cheaper then. Son thought it was awesome. great cd will look for more<br />.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a surprising book for me. I was not ready for the experience, but then I had to read all three because I wanted to know what happened.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My daughter and her best friend are red-headed Irish dancers who love anything even vaguely Celtic.  At last there's a movie available to them that has a strong, self-assured heroine who still has a mother.  The fact that the heroine and her mother have a stronger, healthier relationship after their trials recommends the movie even more.  The girls empathize with the heroine and absolutely adore the three little boys in this film.  It's even enjoyable for the adults watching it with them.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Oh my this whole Trilogy introduced me to things I did not know about. I liked it and was caught up over the summer with the rest of the nation. Not sure I would recommend anyone to read them if they do not want a lot of knowledge about what goes on in people lives in the bedroom.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|The app won't open past the into...I get to the &quot;continue&quot; screen to start the game and it takes me back to the app store.

B008K6DU4Y|5.0|This  program plays .Avi files, which is something the other programs have trouble with. It work as well as VLC does on my computers. Since VLC for android is really ready yet this is the best.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I have the free version from play store on my android tablet and that has the update. kindle fire paid version is still not showing any updates. what's that abt.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I went with my Grandson to see this last year in the theater last year and so I know my 3 Grandchildren would LOVE this movie as much as we did.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy this game a lot, does not hang up. what do you mean 10 more words required?  get real.....
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Huge, huge fan of the first one. The second movie felt like the series was gonna be a one-hit wonder... not so. Josh Brolin is beyond pitch-perfect as a young Agent K, the storyline is totally inspired and the pacing and humor are dead-on. So glad I didn't let this one slip-by after being mostly disappointed with the second installment.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|It crashes no matter what I do. I reloaded and restarted but nothing works, especially the game! I hope they fix it.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Great movie...Very intense and has some very surprising scenes.  I have seen it twice and was looking for the book it was taken from &#34;Ghost Walkers&#34; but I understand that it is out of print at this time...So I am searching for it and various bookstores.
1439107955|5.0|For those that love science, you will eat this book up.  For those that do not, you will be interested but it may be harder for you to grasp the more intricate experiments that are described in this book.<br /><br />Overall, I would reccomend this book for anyone looking to learn more about cancer, whether out of interest or necessity.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is another game that gets under your skin.  I already have bought coins but that gets a little pricey.  I know that the more coins you drop onto the ledge the better your chances are to achieve the challenge.  It's a great game and I would definely recommend this game to anyone .
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept surprising me, I loved this book! Probably the best book I have ever read.  Couldn't put it down.  Great read for women
0061438294|5.0|The book is an easy read.  It explains body language that we have all noticed with people and although some of the body language is obvious, the intent or limbic manifestations could be misread or interpeted incorrectly.  This book is very handy for the quiet observer.  With time and a supply of subjects, I feel that the ability to read someone's inner feelings could be achieved through this book's teaching and insights. For the active interviewer, the tips presented in this book needs to be learned, understood and applied in order to correctly assess the validity of the interview exchange.  I highly recommend this book.
