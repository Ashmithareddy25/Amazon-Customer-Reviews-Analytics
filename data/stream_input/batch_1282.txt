B001DHXT1G|4.0|Update: I never did get a chance to send the disc back to Amazon, but I did send an email to the studio telling them I felt I'd been mislead. Some time later an email showed up in my inbox with instructions to download the digital copy. Really glad the studio made this right for me. Not sure what the current discs will offer you.<br /><br />The description says it's the 2-disc version. One disc is the digital copy which allows playback on non blu-ray players, especially computer, iPad, etc. The code for the digital copy was not included with my disc and if you look at the SERIOUSLY FINE PRINT on the back it says the code \\"may not be valid after 10/31/09\\". Kinda ridiculous that they'd continue to market the digital copy feature on the disc packaging more than 2 years after it has been disabled.<br /><br />Sending the disc back. The movie is not good enough to overlook the fact that the studio mislead me into buying it. Amazon would do well to update the product description as well.

0141183675|5.0|It is difficult to believe that this beautiful novel was once banned in many countries and the subject of a sensational trial in the United Kingdom. In Lady Chatterley's Lover, D.H. Lawrence tells the tale of a young married woman, who after her husband becomes paralyzed from the waist down, becomes increasingly sexually frustrated. While her husband is prepared to look the other way as Lady Chatterley has affairs with those of her own class, all hell breaks loose when love blossums between Lady Chatterley and Mellors, her husbands games keeper. Mellors is by no means a good or perfect man, nor is Lady Chatterley the perfect heroine. However, there is something beautiful about their relationship which is based on sexual compatibility, rather than belonging to the same social class.<br /><br />Despite its reputation for a few well-written, but explicit scenes, Lady Chatterley's lover is a beautiful novel that asks many questions about the British class system and the notion of love being more important than duty or status.
0439023521|3.0|I'm only halfway through this book, and I must say, the story and characters really have hooked me. What I must comment on, however, is the atrocious grammar. I'm surprised that no one else has mentioned it so far.   While the book is written in present-tense, the author quite often randomly switches to past-tense, just for a sentence, then switches back. It is jarring. Also, she uses terrible sentence fragments in her descriptions, which could have easily been solved by the simple placement of a colon or a dash. The structure of her sentences is throwing me off so badly I can hardly enjoy the book; I suppose that is the curse of someone with an English Literature degree.  Sadly, these things would have been solved by a good editor. I wonder how these dramatic errors in the very fabric of her style managed to slip by... or if this book was even edited at all.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a awesome and you can find golden. eggs or just try and beat it. It gets harder as you go.!!!!!!!!
030788743X|2.0|A strained premise, a derivative plot, two-dimensional characters, an entirely predictable finale --- yeah, I get it, 80s pop references, blah blah blah, but really, this book was a huge disappointment.

140053271X|1.0|OK so a rating of 1 for the product itself is unfair.  This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.  Various contacts via on-line support chat, telephone support and visits to Barnes and Noble stores have yielded the following:  The people on the other end of the conversation basically have no knowlege of the problem and direct you through a series of needless exercises in hopes that something will work.  If you escalate, you will eventually get to B&N personnel who will acknowledge the problem and proceed to give you a non-answer.  If you compare this experience to the recent Kindle Fire problems you find Amazon.com stating they have a problem, what they are doing to fix it and an estimate of when things will be better.  Recent announcements tell you that Amazon.com has followed through on this and that the first batch of fixes are already available.  Barnes and Noble, acting in a manner that is the reverse of Amazon.com, continues to let those with the Wi-Fi problem live with that problem.  While you will not find any reference to the problem on the B&N site a Google search on \\"Barnes and Noble Simple Touch W-Fi problems\\" or a similar search, will give you a better feel for Simiple Touch owners who are struggling.  SOLUTIONS:  Drive to another location where Wi-Fi works (suggested by one B&N person).  For PC owners with Internet access, you can still connect to B&N from your PC, buy your E-product, download it and transfer it to your Simple Touch.  Your less technical friends and relatives or those who do not have a PC and rely on working wFi-Fi may not be so lucky.  Of course another solution would be to 1.Acknowledge the problem, 2.State and estimated date when a resolution may be available. 3.Fix the problem and announce the fix.  Amazon.com did this.  Why can't Barnes and Noble? Good luck to those without this problem.  You have a nice light, long battery life E-reader that works well in appropriate lighting.  The reading experience is quite nice.  And for 1.1.X, lets hope it doesn't introduce you to the Barnes and Noble problem resolution experience.  2011-12-27: I continue to try to resolve this problem on my own and have so far determined that all other Wi-Fi devices (several) I own connect fine to my home network including a Nook Color (strange being it is from the same company).  Also, others who have recently visited my home and needed to connect to Wi-Fi had no problems going through my router with their devices.  I drove to a McDonalds for a test as well with some of my devices.  All my other devices connected to Wi-Fi at McDonalds including the Nook Color.  The Simple Touch \\"found\\" Wi-Fi at McDonalds but could not complete the connection using McDonald's \\"proxy\\" software where you had to comply before you could continue.  The Nook Color was presented the acceptance message from the proxy through the browser on the Nook Color.  I may not understand the correct procedure on the Simple Touch, but it does not appear to be obvious.  The Simple Touch did connect via Wi-Fi at B&N and at my local library. Technicians I talked to advised against purchasing another router as a solution as the problem may also exist for other routers as well.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|At first the gang was annoying me to heck. I mean seriously, in terms of fulfilling the roles of a bunch of punk kids trying to be all tough and thug-like, they did a good enough job to make me not like the very much. And for them to become the eventual protagonists of the story and not the happy little nurse character does make for a bit of a shift for any audience member.<br /><br />But don't worry, the aliens totally make up for it. They're wonderfully visual with their luminescent teeth set against their pitch black bodies - seriously awesome look. And what's funny is that for the most part it's obvious that they're guys in what are practically gorilla suits - but the contrast of the green glow versus the rest of their bodies is just awesome. Throw in some classic horror movie blood and gore effects and you're pretty much set.<br /><br />What makes the movie work is how it combines elements from your classic alien invasion kind of movie with the sensibilities of a zombie apocalypse or survival horror flick. I'm really impressed with how Cornish managed to create that kind of a mood for the movie without having it dip too far into being overly scary or brooding. Thus it maintains a weird humorous undercurrent to things without going too far into the realm of slapstick or something.<br /><br />The whole movie is visually impressive - you'd never think that it was produced with a budget of approximately $13 million. The shots were generally well done, the action nicely intense and the aliens fairly scary all throughout. It doesn't pretend to be a more complicated story than it is - so you just get good entertainment as the crew try to kill the aliens before they get killed in turn.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|This is a slightly crude but very funny movie that doesn't expect to be taken seriously.  If you liked Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, or any other movies with Simon Pegg and Nick frost, you'll probably like this one.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|interesting game... it has different locations you can go to and use different items in.  It keeps your interest going.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game will provide many hours of fun. Not easy to win, but very easy to play. Appropriate for all ages.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|I got these shoes around 3 months ago and I have loved them ever since they came. They're comfortable and stylish and I wear them almost every day. The only complaint is that after a few months I started to wear a hole in my big toe but it's small and I don't even notice it half the time.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Exceptional movie.  Great Service.  The movie arrived promptly and was just as I ordered it.  I would recommend this Seller to everyone.
B005WKKI96|5.0|All of Lila Downs' albums are different from each other.  Each person seems to have a different favorite.  But they in each one are consistently creative, with a textured lovely voice and amazing musicianship.  I have all of the albums,and it's hard to top for me \\"La Sandunga\\" and \\"One Blood - Un Sangre\\" but this one is nothing short of wonderful and sure comes close.  It is far superior to her *one* weaker effort (in my opinion), \\"Shake Away\\" and a return to form.    By the way, if you're not acquainted with her, Lila is a treasure who must not be missed live.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|My wife and I had watched the first 5 seasons of Dexter.  When her children came to live with us we talked about it with them and they saw some of the later episodes;  and like us became quickly addicted.  We purchased this season for them so they could watch the entire Season to see the first of Dexter's Seasons.  They have now seen all of his seasons and can't get enough of Dexter.  So.....come on baby....keep on making them.  LEt's have a new episode.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series: both books and movies. This is a great set for people that want all of the movies in one collection. I bought this for myself for Christmas so that I can have my own set instead of sharing with my family. I'm so excited to have all 8 movies and to be able to have a marathon from first to last.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game! I love that you don't have to drag the cards around, clicking works great! I am addicted, thanks a lot
B005HSL626|4.0|this is a great game but it does not deserve 5 stars because there are a few things I don't like about it but I don't want to say them because I don't want to make people feel bad
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This movie is an absolute spectacle. Some people say it looks more like a video game than an actual movie. I like the use of the film grain. Some parts are very violent and perverse, but the overall message is spot-on. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and a must-own Blu-Ray.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this collection.  After watching these three unknown child actors (Daniel, Rupert and Emma) grow up on film, I will truly miss them.  This boxed set was definitely worth every penny I paid for it.  Am anxiously awaiting JK Rowling to utilize her creative juices to create another mind-blowing series for young and old alike in the future.
1904994679|5.0|I have to give this five stars because of the look on my granddaughter's face when she opened the package on Christmas eve.  She's eight and she loves odd statistics and she just whooped and hugged the book! Then she started reading us some of the grosser ones. lol! For the right age group, this is a fantastic gift.  I would have preferred the great old yellow-covered one with the old-fashioned line drawings that was as distinctive as an almanac. This one, while a solid quality book with tons of photos and information to keep the reader totally engrossed, looks like any other nice gift book - from the cover, at least. But I'm probably just getting old; my granddaughter loved it and no doubt kept my daughter and son-in-law up all night quoting from it.
B005MJ883K|5.0|I am glad this wasn't one of those \\"toys\\" that is suppose to be challenging and I was able to complete in ten minutes.  This one is definitely worth the money I spent and it truly gives your mind a work out.  I'd recommend it to all my friends.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I can't add much to the other reviews here, except to say that this is most definitely NOT a chick flick!<br /><br />I'm a 59-year-old white man, and this movie made me cry my eyes out.  Seriously, I think I went through half a box of Kleenex, and I'm tearing up again as I'm typing this.<br /><br />All the performances are wonderful, the script and direction are spot-on, and the musical score is well-chosen and evocative.<br /><br />It surprises me to hear that the book is a work of fiction.  These stories seem so real.<br /><br />I am also saddened to think that although race relations may have improved since the early sixties, the chasm in our society between rich and poor most definitely has grown ever larger.<br /><br />Today the one percent is every bit as smug and complacent as the rich white women depicted in this film, and they employ the rest of us to take care of them at slave wages.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that \\"The Help\\" refers not just to the maids depicted here, but the book they contributed to, speaking truth to power and wealth.<br /><br />Let us hope that works of art like \\"The Help\\" continue to spotlight the inequities that threaten the fabric of our society today.
B000W94FE6|5.0|This is not a review, but a question.  Does anyone know what the P.S. in the title means?  Thanks for your input and any help you can give on this question.

0743298039|5.0|This novel was a constant surprise - I must have gasped about five times while reading it, as I didn't see the plot resolutions coming. A lovely tale to curl up with, and, as others have said, once I started, I couldn't put it down. This is one I've recommended to ALL my friends -
0345529057|4.0|I must say these books are a great read for anyone who enjoys fantasy novels.  I received them as a present after watching the HBO series.  The books have fantastic stories and the characters are engaging.  I found the writing to be of average quality.  Occasionally Martin falls into the trap of over-describing love scenes, making him seem like he's never actually left his mother's basement.  Beyond that, I was pleased to receive these books and found them to be nicely bound.  One nit: The books were sent to me out of order.  It seems like a little complaint, but for someone who wasn't sure about the order in which the books were written, it was irritating to realize that the books were sent to me out of order (I double checked online before I started reading).  Other than that, I was very pleased with this series and will be ordering book 5.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I have no complaints on the actual film portion of this movie.  It is some of Christopher Nolan's finest work and features excellent acting.  I have never seen a more believable joker, and as a Batman fangirl, I can tell you that this is the best Batman movie I have ever seen.  The Bluray disc, however, had an unexpected \\"feature.\\"  While this movie looks amazing in full HD, and I fully recommend buying it in Bluray, you should know that some of the scenes were shot specifically for IMAX.  These scenes have a different aspect ratio than the rest of the film.  As a result, some of the movie, it will fill your entire television screen, and then other portions of the movie will have the black bar effect.  It's an annoying quirk to the Bluray, and I'm not sure why they didn't fix it somehow.  That said, if you buy the movie on Bluray, you will be stunned by how much better it looks than the DVD rendering.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I like this movie quite a bit.  I may only watch it during the holiday season, but it is a very uplifting movie without some of the normally irritating romantic comedy quirks.  This holiday, I asked my boyfriend to watch it with me, and he actually LIKED it.  It is a little hokey, so you have to suspend your \\"ick\\" factor while watching it, but the stories are sweet without being too saccharine, and I have found than a good amount of men actually enjoy the movie.  It is definitely a keeper.
1401923127|4.0|It took bruce till around chapter 4 to get to what this book is about. chapter 5(biology and belief) and chapter 7 (concious Parenting) in my opinion is the best chapters. although he slightly rambles on about personal stories, I think the book was decent. Not bad, but not all that super great.
B0063IH60K|4.0|As far as solitaire goes, this one is pretty good.  I seem to win a lot.  I could do without the ads
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is great to keep track of the weather today,tomorrow and in the coming days. I especially like the satellite view so I can see the weather heading our way.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Ok, saw this Blu-Ray and had to take the chance and see how it was. It was amazing!!! She is so talented and funny to watch also. It is almost like she connects with you through the show. So glad I added this to my concert collection on Blu-rays! You will NOT be disappointed buying this one. Buy one for yourself and as a gift to give to someone else. The video is high quality and the sound is amazing! Very good quality Blu-Ray. I will be watching this one many times. Thanks Adele!
B005HSL626|5.0|I really like this app. its super fun and really addictive. I wasn't really sure about it when I first got it but its actually a really great way to pass the time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Its addictive &ndash; hard to stop once I start. Great being able to go back to my game if I have to stop while playing. Love it!
B006P4H7OW|5.0|Movies, books and film have fascinated me since childhood.  I am an avid viewer and reader of great stories, plotlines and characters.  My husband purchased an HD TV and I was skeptical about watching anything other than some choice Blu Ray films.  \\"American Horror Story\\" proved to be the exception and I found myself counting down the days until FX aired the newest episode.  The only thing that concerned me as the season progressed was I could not figure out how they would continue for another season.  Everything seemed to be winding down and the power of the house and its evil spirits seemed to be the likely victor.  \\"Afterbirth\\" was my revelation that there will be much more intense, captivating drama to come.  If you are not frightened easily nor offended by nudity and a bit of traditional horror flair, this show is for you.  The plot and characters have room to grow but are clear enough to keep you watching.  I was surprised a few times throughout the season with its twists and turns, (this does not happen to me; I am the one who solves the crime within the first 15 minutes of an episode).  \\"Afterbirth\\" was no exception.  I left surprised, amused and wanting more.
B002RKSXJG|4.0|I heard of this book on the Kindle forum, and decided to give it a try. It is a well-written mystery. I had trouble putting it down once the story really got going. While I agree with others that the character of Laura is weak and therefore not at all attractive, it didn't take away my enjoyment of the story. The villains are human, though Sir Percival is less so than the Count. For anyone who likes Victorian mysteries, this is a good read.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|I had actually gone to the movies and viewed the movie there.  The movie seemed a little long at the time and I knew I did not catch everything... That is why I purchased it!  Overall great movie!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I got this app for my Kindle Fire and it works great. Lots of fun to play, easy to use. Great way to relax!

B0052RDHTM|1.0|Ken Follett is one of my most favorite authors. I have read all of his books. I was very disappointed in \\"Fall of the Giants\\" It being the first part of a trilogy I hope Mr Follet abandons book 2 and 3 and moves on to writing novels the way he has in the past.  Even though he had great success with his past epic novels World Without End and Pillars of the Earth, bigger isn't always better, at least in the case of Fall of Giants. Worst book I have read in years. I only kept reading to the end because Follett is one of my favorite authors and I was hoping it would get better the futher I read but disappointingly it didn't.
B003L77G06|5.0|This is one of the funniest series on television today. The actors have a great espirit de corp and really fit the parts! Great buy!
B00005JM20|5.0|We ordered this movie to view after our family Thanksgiving feast. We try to choose something that will appeal to all. There were adults and children 11 and above. What a great, light, and entertaining flick.  We decided Rowan Atkinson was a cross between James Bond and Jacques Clouseau (Pink Panther detective movies-Peter Sellers).  We cannot wait to see Johnny English reborn!!  Amazon was incredible in getting this movie to us on time as promised.  Thank you!!
B005C5A66G|5.0|MH makes nobody dissapointed with this new album. Melodic and aggresive. Just as good as The Blackening.

0312370830|5.0|Julia Jarmond is a 45-year-old American ex-pat living with her husband and daughter in Paris and working as a journalist.  When her editor assigns her the task of researching the story of the French government's 1942 roundup of Jews to the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver and later deportation to their deaths at Auschwitz, she finds herself simultaneously tasked with researching the story of her own life and coming to terms with truths that are as ugly as they are unavoidable.<br /><br />Tatiana de Rosnay's debut novel [[ASIN:1250004217 Sarah's Key (Special Gift Edition)]]weaves together the story of 10-year-old Sarah, whose family was swept away from her in the roundup, the story of Julia's in-laws, and the story of Julia herself.  As Julia breaks challenges the taboos of silence surrounding the Paris round-up, she also challenges the silence between herself and her husband, among her in-laws, and within herself.  The truth, once exposed, will not be avoided.  The truth, once confronted, changes lives forever, and sometimes for the better.<br /><br />De Rosnay's novel reaches deeply and compassionately into the grief of the Holocaust as one child experienced it and finds in those ruins of the human soul honest, fragile poetry.
B000H2MTUA|4.0|Since my recent trip to Ireland this book gave me a true picture of what the people of Ireland indured and survived.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I purchased the MicroShell with the expectation that it would be light and functional and contrary to several other users, I was not disappointed.  When I first viewed it, it reminded me of the HP portfolio that I purchased for my Touchpad and when delivered I found it quite similar.  If I were to suggest any changes it would be to mimic the manner in which the Touchpad folio fits completely around the tablet providing more extensive protection for the edges. Otherwise, this is a great item that one should consider.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|Works great now for Kindle Fire. Very simple and straightforward. They redid the app it seems and now it works great.

B006O5XYWG|5.0|This was a good movie. I want to know what happens next! I am going to name my next pet Caesar.
0439023521|4.0|Going into this I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had heard good things about it, but then again I had heard good things about Twilight as well.  Honestly, the best comparison that I have for this is Harry Potter.  The plot is not at all like it, but it shares a lot of the characteristics that Harry Potter has.  It has a very addicting writing style and the characters are people that can be identified with.  This in and of itself makes it worth it to read.  The downside is, the characters are not spectacularly crafted and the plot could be better.  Overall, I would recommend the books, especially the first one, but don't expect to be reading Martin or Rothfuss.  Instead, enjoy them for what they are.  Young adult books that captivate their audience.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|My sister and two daughters love Criminal Minds as much as I do.  It is wonderful to all sit together and have a Criminal Minds Fest day.  We are all in different states, so when we get together we watch them ALL.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|One thing you can say about the Eagles is that they don't cheat you on their effort.  This package includes the 175 minute concert which carries over to disc 2 on DVD.  There are some additional interviews on disc 2 as well.  The DVD is beautifully shot with thoughtful direction and includes a DTS 5.1 audio track along with PCM Stereo.<br /><br />The Eagles are more than 4 these days, at least when they tour.  Here there are 8 additional musicians including a horn section and some terrific guitar work by Steuart Smith.  Skimpy on new material, the boys manage to add some verve to the 30 songs here.  They are one of the few groups from long ago that manage to do that.  There is no denying their impact on popular music over the years.  They are great musicians, excellent song writers and can harmonize as well as anyone.  They remain relevant in the music world which is evident by their sold out shows across the world.

B002LFAHBO|4.0|This is a terrific movie for Christmas for those wanting the seasonal themes without the specificity.  Set in London, the film has all the appearances of one of those holiday movies we see several times a year (New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day) and in fact is.  The difference is that this one is well done.  The music alone (no not Christmas carols) is worth the price of admission (or purchase or rental).  Several stories evolve at the same time.  The characters are loosely connected in some way, although it isn't all that evident for a while.  In fact if there is a dig at the film it may be that there are too many story lines.<br /><br />Director and writer Richard Curtis assembles a cast that Robert Altman would have been proud of.  Liam Neeson is a recent widower raising his step-son.  Hugh Grant is the recently elected British Prime Minister, single but looking.  Keira Knightley is a new bride who may have married the wrong man.  Andrew Lincoln (TV's \\"Walking Dead\\") may be the right man.  Bill Nighy is hilarious as an aging rock star trying again with a Christmas twist on an old song.  Laura Linney is a spinster-like office employee longing over a co-worker but obligated to care for an institutionalized brother.  Emma Thompson is the wife of an executive (Alan Rickman) who may be cheating on her.  Kris Marshall is the hound dog Brit who can't get a date so decides to go to Wisconsin (!) where he's sure he can find plenty of women who will love his accent.  He does!  They are Shannon Elizabeth, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert, Denise Richards and Ivana Milicevic.  There is the couple whose job is too \\"stand in\\" for actors in a porn film and eventually fall in love.  Finally, there is Colin Firth, a writer who falls for his housekeeper (Lucia Moniz) who doesn't speak English.<br /><br />I know this all sounds so convoluted, but it works.  The writing is crisp and funny.  The film is sweet and moving at times.  There is humor, heartbreak and romance.  I'm also glad to see that the filmmakers and studio kept the \\"R\\" rating rather than excise some of the more titillating scenes and change the language.  Well done.  Merry Christmas!lmmakers and studio kept the \\"R\\" rating rather than excise some of the more titillating scenes and change the language.  Well done.  Merry Christmas!

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This movie is great. Our entire family enjoyed the Harry Potter series, including this finale. Thus, we'd give the Bluray and DVD 5 stars.  That being said, the Ultraviolet copy is streaming digital and worthless. We have loaded other digital movies onto our boys' iPod Touch and iPad devices and they can take the movies with them wherever they go, including car rides to relatives in others states. You cannot do this with Ultraviolet because it requires a continuous internet connection (via streaming). Save your money and get the Bluray and/or DVD without the Ultraviolet. If this is the future of digital media, it stinks. We will never buy another movie with prepackaged Ultraviolet again. Warner Brothers, I hope you're listening. We thought we were getting a regular digital copy as we had never heard of Ultraviolet before. I never want to hear of it again.
031603441X|5.0|By Keith Richards<br />Back Bay Books 576 pgs<br />978-0316034418<br />From my library<br />Rating: 5 - Sheer Perfection<br /><br />Full disclosure: I am hopelessly in love with Keith Richards<br /><br />OK, now that you know that I'd like to talk about rock and roll for a minute. Rock and roll is a force of nature. It can and does work radical change on every culture it touches. Remember back in the day when parents were horrified by it and teachers warned of a break down in discipline and preachers were calling rock and roll the devil's music? Everyone was running around hyperventilating and claiming that this music was all about sex and the ruination of western civilization was at hand. I always thought that claim about sex was utterly ridiculous. But you know what? It is about sex. It's sexy, exciting, feverish, sweaty and little dirty (come on you know it.) Hedonism personified. So is Keith Richards.<br /><br />Mr. Richards is living quite a life and shows no signs of slacking off after some 50 years as a guitarist, vocalist,  songwriter and co-founder of the Rolling Stones. He spent his childhood in Dartford, England as an only child. He joined a boys' choir and sang in Westminster Abbey for the queen. Then his voice began to change with puberty and that was all she wrote for that choir. They kicked him out. Keith was devastated. It was a betrayal. And so he turned into a delinquent, sort of, and to this day carries with him a deeply felt contempt for anyone or anything claiming authority. His grandfather Gus gave him a guitar.<br /><br />Keith discovered rock and roll while listening to the radio late at night in his room under the covers because he was supposed to be asleep. \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\" Then he began to hunt down rock and roll and it's predecessor, American blues. Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf. He taught himself to play these songs. Then one day he happened into a man on a train platform with a couple of these records under his arm. Mick Jagger. They began to get together to play and Mick knew a couple of other guys and pretty soon they had a band. They played covers of rhythm and blues songs. The Stones played the club circuit where they were very successful. The band had accomplished what Keith and Mick had envisioned: they were a highly successful London rhythm and blues band. Then along came Andrew Oldham. Turns out that old story about his locking Keith and Mick in a kitchen until they came out with a song is true. \\"As Tears Go By.\\"<br /><br />And then Toad's Wild Ride.<br /><br />Keith's personal relationships have been tumultuous, let's say. A decade long relationship with Anita Pallenberg gave him two children, Marlon and Angela. Another baby died as an infant of CIDS. Keith doesn't say much about that and I wouldn't either. His relationship with Anita finally fell apart due to a devastating heroin addiction. Keith finally got clean and Anita couldn't. A few years later he met and fell in love with Patti Hansen, a model in New York. They have been married for almost 30 years and have two daughters, Theodora and Alexandra.<br /><br />This book is also deeply satisfying. It is candid, the good and the bad, the ugly and the sublime, and as a reader you are grateful for that. Keith is not a tease. My conclusions in the end are that this is a moral man. He knows right and wrong in a cosmic sense. He gives and demands loyalty most of all. And he is a loyal father, son, husband, band mate and friend. In the end the best thing about this book is the style in which it is told. There's a riff behind the words. Life is written as if you were sitting at the kitchen table having a drink, a smoke or two, and telling stories.<br /><br />Please visit the author: [...]<br /><br />And http:[...]le of other guys and pretty soon they had a band.

B001NEK2GE|1.0|I am usually a fan of Logitech, but this one failed in a few places. The most annoying part that caused me to return this item was that it would not keep the setting for games. Also, the keys are so stiff, and takes more effort to press at prolonged periods. I keep reverting back to a cheap keyboard, because the WASD keys are not only stiff, it requires a certain angle to properly press. I find that my hand has to be closer to the top of the control, making it hard to press the lower set of keys. I purchased this mainly for SWTOR, and unfortunately it will not keep my custom settings. Additionaly, the mini-stick is again too stiff and do not have enough friction, causing one's thumb to slide. If it was less stiff, this would not be such a problem. Although it has an LCD screen, it is basically useless and provides info that is already on your monitor. I would not recommend this product unfortunately.
0307477479|5.0|Jennifer Egan<br />Anchor 352 pgs<br />978-0307477477<br />From my personal library<br />Rating: 5 - Sheer Perfection<br /><br />Goon = Time<br /><br />And in the immortal lyrics of Don McLean's American Pie: Can music save your mortal soul?<br /><br />A Visit From the Goon Squad says yes it can. Visiting the present and the past and back again, this infuriating and lovely novel is about the ravages of  time and how it affects a cast of characters whose lives swoop and dart and intersect each other at the most unlikely points along the way. Just as importantly this book is about music, rock and roll and how it transports and transcends and heals.<br /><br />Let's see if I can get this straight. As a teenager Sasha is a drug user and kleptomaniac who is a passionate devotee of music and of Bennie and his high school band. Years later Sasha is an assistant to Bennie who has become a music executive famous for discovering a band called The Conduits and starting his own record label. He was in a high school band with Scotty who has been down and out and possibly a little mental. Years later Scotty becomes a successful musician with Bennie's management. Stephanie is Bennie's ex-wife. She works as a publicist for Dolly who has a daughter named Lulu. Years later Lulu is an assistant to Bennie and hires Alex, who had a one night stand with Sasha, to promote Scotty's first concert in 30 years. Sasha eventually reconnects with Drew, her college boyfriend. They marry and have a daughter who confounds Sasha by keeping a diary using Powerpoint.And any number of various characters.<br /><br />The question is what happens between A and B? How do you get from back there to right here? How can you tell if the journey was successful? This set of criteria is put forth for your consideration by Jules,  Stephanie's journalist brother, while he was in prison:<br /><br />How to evaluate the relative success or failure of a life: \\"Marriage or lack thereof, children or lack thereof, professional success or lack thereof, healthy bank account or lack thereof, contact with childhood friends or lack thereof, ability to sleep peacefully at night or lack thereof, fulfillment of sprawling, loopy youthful ambitions or lack thereof, ability to fight off bouts of terror and despair or lack thereof...\\"<br /><br />Now these are all good questions. But can any of us come out in the black on all of them? At any given time? I don't think so. And neither do these characters. But they do get from A to B and they are moving along to C D E.....<br /><br />If you'd like to visit the author: [...]eof, contact with childhood friends or lack thereof, ability to sleep peacefully at night or lack thereof, fulfillment of sprawling, loopy youthful ambitions or lack thereof, ability to fight off bouts of terror and despair or lack thereof...\\"    Now these are all good questions.

B005OK725M|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, it didn't sound like it would catch my attention.   In fact, it sounded like a another cheesy B revenge movie with some crazy fool running around going nuts & blowing people up, with mostly or all unrealistic movie stunts & CGI...  I decided to further research this movie by reading reviews on amazon.com, and after reading the very positive reviews I decided to buy this movie on it's bluray release date.  I watched it last night & I must say it is SIMPLY AMAZING!!!  What a great movie!!!! A+ to everyone involved...  Zoe Saldana was absolutely perfect for her leading role!  Her acting was OUTSTANDING & she should definately perform in more types of movie genres like this one.  It was easy to see her Heart & Soul were both completely into this movie.  She wasn't over the top, as Jolie was at times in Salt.  Don't get me wrong the movie had plenty of action & great cinematography, but it was all believable & so well wrote/acted that is was smooth as butter!    The story line was perfect...   Yes, it is a revenge plot, but this movie offered much more than your typical revenge type of movie. It had a Great & Believable story, not too mention the acting was PERFECT...  The movie had several characters involved in the story with high emotions & energy that added drama, action & mystique to the story. The other characters in the movie fed off of Zoe Saldana's Masterpiece performance!!!   I have no doubt they can make a second installment of this movie & they should.  Although, they should promote it better the next time though, as I heard hardly anything about this movie until just a few weeks before it's bluray release.  Don't Rent this movie, BUY, BUY, BUY it...   You will not be disappointed!  Thanks for reading my review...

Storage is endless, there's a pocket for everything, and your monopods and tripods can always come with you!
0307269752|5.0|I avoided this book for the longest time. I now realize that was a huge mistake. This crime mystery is not just fascinating in the story as it unfolds, and the truly unique and sympathetic characters, it displays a craftsmanship of writing one rarely sees today. One of the reasons I had avoided this was because I was skeptical of the translation. I had thought that it would be difficult to take a well written story in Swedish, and convert to an equally well written translation in English. I was wrong. The translation was excellent. Only in a few fleeting phrases did I sense some difficulty in the construction where the translator might have struggled.<br /><br />Bottom line. If you like extremely intricate mysteries, characters you wish you could personally know, and extremely talented writing, this is it. Don't find an excuse to not read this book. Once you pick this up, you will regret the time you missed not reading.

B00407PNWO|5.0|This is the very best of Errol Flynn and my favorite movie of all time. This type of movie will never be made again because of the cost of such a production. In addition, the supporting cast is great and too long to list. Not much special effects, but great scripts, great acting and great scenery. There have been several Robin Hood films made previous and subsequent to this classic. None are as good as this. The music is by Korngold and is fantastic. Join Flynn and the Merry Men of Sherwood you won't be disappointed.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I have watched Woody Allen films for decades often in a theatre that had a handful of people when the film started only to have most of them depart before 20 minutes were up. I watched one in a huge theatre in Hollywood all by myself...surreal... but I have always loved his films. It seems they are much more appreciated in Europe than the US but perhaps most Americans don't get it. He has a distinct humor with a cinematic brilliance that perhaps may be unsurpassed in the history of film making. His characters often remind the viewer of Allen himself...indeed if you closed your eyes when watching Gil Pender you could in fact imagine it as Woody Allen in some of his earlier films.  Much like Annie Hall, Manhattan, Broadway Danny Rose and others Midnight in Paris excels at scenery and nostalgic moments that make the viewer believe they indeed walked onto the screen and joined the cast. His characters seem to just walk out and incorporate you into their storey. Another brilliant score and background. It incorporates extremely well the visits from present to past and back again. WooHoo no rotten tomatoes here!   Besides if you are a Paris lover you will feel you made a quick visit to this astounding city.

B005FITIK0|4.0|When watching \\"Young Adult\\", I couldn't help but think of this year's \\"Bad Teacher\\". The two films have a similar central character: an aging former \\"Queen Bee\\", still beautiful, but also still stuck in adolescent, immature delusions about how her life should be (as well as a penchant for substance abuse). However, while \\"Bad Teacher\\" was a low-brow, lightweight comedy, \\"Young Adult\\" aims much higher, and although it has moments of humor, is a serious and often painful character study.<br /><br />Mavis left her small town home of Mercury to move to Minneapolis, where she has had a fairly successful career as a writer of young adult fiction. In her personal life, she has become isolated and lonely, filling up her time with excessive drinking and one-night-stands. When she receives an email notice that her former high school sweetheart, Buddy, had recently become a father, she develops a bizarre and unlikely plan to go back to her home town and win him back.<br /><br />And so it begins. Although affable Buddy is happy to meet Mavis for a friendly drink, he is clearly content with his life as a husband (to a fun and compassionate woman) and new father, and has no romantic interest in Mavis. Clueless, Mavis continues her pursuit of Buddy, believing that the two are meant to be together and that he secretly feels trapped in his small town life. The more Mavis continues her pursuit, the more she humiliates herself, revealing her immaturity and desperation.<br /><br />While staying in Mercury, Mavis does also make a genuine connection to Matt, a former classmate still physically crippled by a brutal attack in high school. Despite superficial differences the two have a lot in common: they're both stuck, unable to move on from the past, and share a love of excessive drinking. Matt, as disappointed and angry as Mavis, is probably the only person in the film to tell her the truth about herself.<br /><br />Charlize Theron gives a terrific, nuanced performance, and is willing to explore her character at both as her most humorous and bitchy as well as at her most pathetic and pitiful. And Patrick Wilson and Patton Oswold both create fleshed out human beings out of characters who could have easily been two dimensional. \\"Young Adult\\" is not always an easy film to watch, but it's definitely a cut above the average Hollywood studio film.ost humorous and bitchy as well as at her most pathetic and pitiful.

B005K17RU0|5.0|have this on.my kindle fire, it runs brest in the background.  does not drain the battery even when left running. When opened in full screen the graphics and the way the information is presented is great.
B004H4XLRE|3.0|[[ASIN:B004H4XLRE Cars 2 World Grand Prix Race Launcher]] is basically a car case for the 10 race cars from the Cars 2 movie. It can \\"launch\\" the cars simultaneously by pressing down on 2 buttons. The cars race about 18\\" on a wood floor, so the launcher isn't very powerful. Each slot has a sticker representing the race car number and country of the race cars from the Cars 2 movie for these characters:  1. Nigel Gearsley 9  2. Shu Todoroki 7  3. Miguel Camino 5  4. Max Schnell 4  5. Francesco Bernoulli 1 - talking version does not fit well - back wheels are wide and scrape against the sides of the slot  6. Lightning McQueen 95 - either non talking version or talking version fits  7. Raoul ÇaRoule 6  8. Jeff Gorvette 24  9. Lewis Hamilton 2  10. Carla Veloso 8
B0054YIQLW|2.0|Olive Films has recently rereleased the Migenes, Domingo, Maazel, and Rosi film version of Bizet's great opera, Carmen. On the plus side: the transfer looks pretty good and appears to be in or close to its original aspect ratio. On the down side: the subtitles are not removable and are in white and yellow. Unremovable subtitles are unforgivable as any self-respecting quality DVD company should know. Reduction of 2 stars. The extras contained on the new restored Second Sight British DVD are absent from the Olive. Unfortunate. Reduction of 1 star. To sum up: 2 stars with a thumbs down for Olive Films. Given the mediocre quality of this DVD I may never buy another DVD from Olive Films again.<br /><br />There are, thankfully, alternatives to the mediocre Olive release of Rosi's Carmen. If you have an all region DVD, and every film and opera buff should, there is a two DVD Second Sight transfer of Carmen. You may get the PAL speedup with the Second Sight and you cannot remove the subtitles but at least you will have the two extras on the Second Sight. The other alternative is the Gaumont transfer that is available in France. It has English subtitles which are removable. So for those of you who do have an all region DVD player you have a choice between the bare bones Olive, the more fulsome Second Sight, and the superior French version. I really wish I had chosen the last.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game! very pleased with the game play and the tile selection. my wife and I have a great time competing for high score.
0240815807|5.0|It doesn't focus on what tools are used but how to use them<br />Gives a universal approach that can be applied to any setup<br />Really breaks down common mixing methods and types of plugins used<br />Breaks down common pitfalls with each (eq, compression, etc)<br />Mentions some good types of tools for the job but doesn't solely use them as examples<br />Mentions what makes the tools good (the controls in the plugs that are important)<br />It helped me get a great mix on any number of recordings. Highly recommended.
0385341008|5.0|I was very blessed to receive this book as a gift this Christmas from my stepsons who are in there late 20's and one a graduate of Yale, and currently a student at Harvard who is studying to receive his PHD in Political Science and working to receive is law degree from Harvard Law School.  He and his girlfriend Brit did not have a clue what to buy for a 60 year old avid reader but took the time to check with Brit's mother and grandmother who belong to book clubs to find their favorite book of 2011, unanimous vote went to The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and One Thousand White Women. I am so pleased with the selections and look forward to sitting in front of the fire this winter and enjoying them. I would like to add that when you are able to see the authors eyes light up the way Annie Barrow's eyes light up when she talks about this book, tells me this book is not to be missed.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Ad's, Brit and Stephen!  Love you guys! G.
B00637TV1I|5.0|Beautiful, energetic, fresh rock-pop music. Reminds me a little to Fleetwood Mac, Cranberries, U2 and The Cure. The best songs? Hard to tell, all are very good. Highlights for Catch Me, Endless Summer, Peace of Mind, Rosebud, and Long Highway, my favorite song of a perfect album.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Like many new Adele fans, we loved a few songs and elected to go the DVD route to check out her performance. Pure and simple, she rocks. Who knew she would be such fun and her interaction with those in the Albert Hall was grand.  This was the timeframe when she had throat problems, wow......no way!  She is great at setting the stage with the story of her life and the interplay with her songwriting.  Many songs may seem deep and sad, but her delivery leaves you speechless.  It is a great DVD/CD and one we will happily watch repeatedly -  not just once and done for this one.  I wish I was there in that huge hall, it had to be amazing. Nice to have a talent that really has the pipes to stand up alone or with an orchestra/band.  Power for days. Loved it.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Bought this product thinking it would help with the problems i had with the kinect , but i found that the Nyko zoom made it even more problematic to get tracked well in big rooms. I expected the wide angle lens to make tracking better but the IR data was getting completely cut off and the tracking actually got worse. The tracking was erratic and it was very tough to select on screen menus. May be good if you donot have enough space in your room but standing 2 feet from the TV is a bad idea as you cant see anything!!! The kinect worked much better without it, mounted it above the tv now and no more tracking woes.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Considering that I'm more of a younger audience, I LOVED these episodes! They're hilarious, interesting, and most importantly, make you want more. After the cliffhanger in the Great Game, I got so mad at the director's for ending it like that. I wanted to know what happened, no scratch that, I neeeded to know what happened. When you want to know what happens THAT badly, you can tell it's probably a good show. I think this \\"modern\\" version of Sherlock Holmes is better just because more people can relate to it. I saw a couple episodes of the \\"older\\" Sherlock Holmes and I just didn't understand it very well, it was to victorian. But this one was way easier to relate to. I especially love it when Sherlock makes these insulting jokes about people, it's hilarious! If I had to change one thing about these episodes I would make more of them! Watch it!!

0385523904|4.0|Apart from goose-stepping soldiers and images of military parades,  I knew almost nothing about North Korea before reading this book. I had picked it up before, but never got round to reading beyond the first chapter of a Kindle sample.<br /><br />Last week I saw surreal Stalinesque Youtube images of a featureless North Korean television announcer who had  a demeanor not unlike a female prison warden, officially telling the nation in a trembling awe struck voice, that their dear leader had passed away.  In the same clip were images of crowds of North Koreans, crying loudly in unison, as if their existence depended on producing copious amounts of compulsory tears.  It was surreal, macabre, fascinating.<br /><br />How, in the 21st century could a place like this still exist ?  How could people be so gullible, the deception so obvious, so complete? How had this come to be?  And why is it that in the 21 century, this place was somehow trapped in the somber decay of a discolored 60s communist time capsule?<br /><br />This book answers many questions about the machinery of this Orwellian superstate and how it manages to skillfuly deceive its people, how this deception impacts the lives of ordinary people and how the images which the world found so surreal, so out of place, would be completely normal if one had lived your entire life in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It gives a sense of the broad mechanisms that forces social cohesion and consensus, and provides a glimpse of how the system is perpetuated through isolation, misinformation, exaggerated half truths and outright lies.<br /><br />Though not a literary feat, the book is well written and provide fascinating insights into the lives of normal people. Interspersed with poignant facts, Demick manages to paint a heartbreaking picture of a dejected place, forgotten in time.  The text is immensely compelling as the reader is drawn deeper into an Orwellian 1984 to discover that North Korea seems more 1984 than1984 itself. The parallels are uncanny. As one the defectors remarked, one cannot but marvel at how the drab dysfunctional sociopolitical landscape of North Korea seems cloned from the imaginary dystopian world of Oceania. The similarities are truly astonishing.<br /><br />Despite being a mesmerizing read, the book is not perfect. The picture Demick paints is a little one dimensional, depicting a gloomy, humorless place filled with citizens who have been reduced to being obedient robots. Its hard to believe that people would so blindly follow a doctrine, without even a smattering of irony or splash of humor. Even the Russians, at the height of dealing with their failed communist system, would joke that they, the workers, pretended to work, and the state pretended to pay.  No doubt the lives of North Koreans must be dotted with at least some humorous stories of its contradictions and situational incompetence, though Demick fails to extract any of it, instead focusing mostly on sketches depicting the cheerless shades of a towering dystopian wasteland.<br /><br /> Though the picture is stark, I often got the impression that she tended to gloss over certain facts, or consciously chose to ignore them, to fit her own image of the place. At times I caught myself questioning some incidental information, and was sporadically left with the impression that some images had to be less uniform in reality than the ones she choose to depict in her book. For example, she sketches a place where very few cars exist, yet one of the defectors, an ordinary mother of no particular social standing is fetched, by private car, at her home, to be whisked to the border from where she would cross into China. How could an ordinary citizen in a place where everyone seems to be watching everyone else, do this without immediately raising a disproportionate amount of suspicion?<br /><br />At times her explanations for a particular sequence of events would not quite make sense. A woman's tofu business goes belly up and the explanation offered is the total absence of electricity for the stove that would boil the soybeans. Yet on the same page the mother goes to the countryside to collect bark and weeds and cook it for hours (presumably using firewood) in a desperate attempt to nourish her family. So why did she not just cook the tofu beans on a fire? Later on we learn that using electricity for cooking had  for years been forbidden. Perhaps, the reality was different. The real reason for the failure of the woman's tofu business may have had very little or nothing to do with the incompetence of the machinery of the state, instead other, more personal reasons must have prevailed.<br /><br />These kind of oddities occur from time to time, leaving some loose threads. The famine of the nineties clearly ended up changing North Korea, but how much or how these changes came about is not clearly explained.<br /><br />Despite these niggling discrepancies, this remains an immensely readable, factual and insightful account of what it must have been like to live in North Korea from the late 1960's to roughly 2005. The story telling is centered around real people and Demick skillfully weave each person's story into a web of historical events, creating an intriguing read that is very hard to put down.<br /><br />If you know little or nothing about North Korea,  Nothing to Envy would be an excellent starting point to understand the broad workings of this fascinating, yet terrifying place. Yet, if you already have a fair working knowledge of its squeaky, mostly broken state machinery, you may find her work a little bland.ce of electricity for the stove that would boil the soybeans.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is so much fun! I love earning the different swords and backgrounds! It's great on the Kindle Fire!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love evernote, it's great to have my notes available on my computer, phone, and now my kindle. well designed app that is easy to use.
B0051CSI0G|2.0|This movie is an awkward mix of bad George A. Romero meets equally bad and pretentious Terrence Malick. I was squirming for the first 30 minutes (not from the gore) and then pressed the \\"open\\" button on my remote. Fin.
0307887960|5.0|It may be similar to other weight loss programs, but I never felt I could do the others. This diet worked for both me and my husband.  He lost over 30 lbs in about 4 months time, going from a size 40 to a size 34.  I have lost over 45 lbs in about 5 months and went from a size 20 to a size 12.  I am over 5'9, so a size 12 is amazing for me.  Our friends are amazed and are always commenting on how good we look now.  It was the easiest diet I could ever imagine!  If you are a meat lover, this diet will work for you especially and the fat just melts away.  I didn't ever feel hungry or deprived, as there are great ideas for sweets too.  It changed our way of thinking.  We just got through the holidays, eating and drinking and cheating here and there, but we now know how to lose the couple of pounds we gained.  The good thing about this diet is that it changes how you think, and gives you control over you weight.  Many of our friends are now losing weight in this same way.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I use this product professionally at work.  I purchase one for home use.  This is an excellent product.  It works get with Win 7 64 bit OS.  I have used t with Pro-Engineer, SolidWorks, and autocad Inventor.  I cannot live without it.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|Even with a $10 rebate on this Kindle Microshell cover, it is not worth $5, much less $29.  It is a cheap piece of plastic with no features that make it worth any more than that.  I'm not sure that any Kindle product can or should be trusted.[[ASIN:B005HSG3TC Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Graphite]]
B005OK725M|5.0|That is, I don't need feedback from Critics who Rate up some of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br />If I'm entertained, that is all that counts.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a very lightweight cover and stand for the kindle fire. I agree it's expensive like most of the reviews, but I think people don't understand the design. It's designed with a hard plastic shell back that fits snugly with a lightweight plastic cover with soft inside to ensure the screen isn't scratched. The rigidity of the front cover doesn't matter as much because of the design of the back, sort of like the hard covers for the iphone or ipod touch.   Not sure what the people with 1 star reviews are complaining about with the stand mechanism because mine works perfectly and it doesn't seem like an area where there could be a defect... The Kindle Fire must be in the actual case for the stand to work.  Maybe they have it upside down?  All in all, its lightweight, and will protect your kindle fire from wear and tear. If you plan on dropping it a lot, maybe go with a heavier case.
B005HSL626|5.0|All I have to say is that this app is awesome I don't care about adds I love it soo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B005OCFGTO|5.0|Returned this product I did not keep it so I returned it.  Not sure what else to say other then I did not need it so it was returned
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is great! You are always in for new surprises and it is a great stress relieved.
B00005JPO1|4.0|I've watched this movie three times now, and appreciate it a bit more each time, but can't see myself giving it 5 stars; it simply isn't as good as the first film, which is deserving of the 5 star tag. However, this newest installment of the Indiana Jones series has much to offer. I think Harrison Ford does great in his 60's. He leaves nothing in the bag in terms of energy and attitude. I absolutely love the library scene, as it's probably one of the most entertaining sequences in the whole series. Cate Blanchett is spectacular in her role, and really gives this movie a boost with her accent and hard edge. Karen Allen doesn't carry that same flare and energy that she had in Raiders as Marion Ravenwood, but at least it's not distracting. This film is signature action as it should be in this legendary series. This movie proves that even an aging Indy still has it. And remember.....\\"If you're going to be a great archaeologist, you gotta get out of the library!\\"
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use my notepad for creating to do lists and this app is perfect for that. The fact that the notes are color coordinated make it very is to be organized. Overall it is a wonderfull app.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Nice slim packaging and a very good price point for the complete set. Purchased as a gift and the recipient was very pleased.

B001GM28HO|4.0|I was a little late to the Lady Gaga party, myself.  I fell in love with \\"Born This Way\\" and then went backwards by purchasing \\"The Fame Monster\\" and last, \\"The Fame\\".  While I would have loved this cd if I got it first, and still think it is very good, it just does not stand up to \\"Born This Way\\" at all.  In my opinion, it really shows how far Lady Gaga has come in her career and how her style has changed and evolved.  It makes me even more excited for what she will do next!  I think this cd is solid and a must-have for true fans but if you're seeking just ONE cd of Gaga I would recommend \\"Born This Way\\" because every single track is amazing.  \\"The Fame\\" has bright spots and a few misses.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|The game was really fun to play, and it was really challenging. I like crime games so this was a great game for me.
1848566980|5.0|Good print quality and lots of illustrations.  Chris Foss is one of my most favourite si-fi illustrators.  His works make my imagination jump over thousand years ahead. Turn the music on and unforgetable jorney begins.  Try these ones:  H.U.V.A. Network  Solar Fields  Fahrenheit Project  I bet it's better then a film :)
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I love Midnight in Paris!  We want to go to Paris so badly and this movie will give you the feel of the city like no other; the beautiful sights and outdoor cafes..Paris in the rain and Paris lighting up at night.  You don't have to love Paris like we do though to love this movie.  This movie is imaginative with a great ultimate message; it's a magical movie mixing humor with something so much deeper below the surface.  The acting is great!  I watched this movie two nights in a row and I am going to watch it many more times over!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
B002ZG99TK|3.0|Don't be fooled by the title, this film is anti-climactic and thus disappointing.<br /><br />Washington (in his second train-based film in a row with Scott and 5th film with him overall) and Pine play the cliched due of retiring veteran and rookie who are grinding away another day at the train yard. But the incompetence of a fat yard worker allows a half-mile long freight loaded with hazardous chemicals to get loose and tear through the countryside. Our heroes then put aside their usual chores to catch up with the loco and hit the brakes all while head office and the media watch and wait.<br /><br />Sound exciting. It's not. There's no real sense of speed. Tony Scott tries to make the audience believe that the train is going really fast with lots of quick, shaky camera pans and some annoying stutter cuts (when will THIS dumb trend come to an end?). It hits a few bumps and scratches a few cars, but no significant damage is done and no breathtaking destruction fills the screen with eye candy.<br /><br />I really have to wonder where the appeal was in the script. There's really nothing worth mentioning between the moment the trains starts and stops (yes, it does indeed stop). If this were a 70s disaster epic it would be 140 minutes long (as opposed to 98), would feature many, many deaths, even more obstacles, and would end with the train blowing up...and all with a PG-rating. In 2010 an easy ride with a couple of flash pans is apparently the best that they can do.<br /><br />Not a keeper.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 5.1 and plenty of features.
B004V2AWKG|5.0|One of the best books i have ever read if not the best an amazing story i would reccomend this book to kids and adults of all ages

B004O3YGMC|5.0|The app performed perfectly when connected to wifi. Having the ability to access my complete PC remotely has proved invaluable. I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants access to their home PC on the move. I am not sure why there are low reviews as this exceeded every one of my expectations.
1856697525|5.0|from my fiance and this book is a knockout!  I love the work of SAUL BASS and am still learning about it!  So graphically appealing and this book is HUGE and HEAVY!  A real treat to look through.  My degree is in ART/ILLUSTRATION and couldn't be happier with this present!
B002KSPKRS|1.0|After reading the directions and following them perfectly I determined that there was something severely wrong with this piece of equipment.  I even followed directions I found on the internet and couldn't make the sound work.  It will go back for a wired system.
B004EPZ084|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I've seen this year.  Most of the comedies this year have left me wanting for more.  They seemed to use swearing to create the comedy.  This is not the case with Horrible Bosses.  The premise is that three guys have jobs where their bosses suck.  One thinks everyone should be there for 14+ hours a day, another wants to only make money off of the company his father started and another one is threatening to tell his wife he slept with her until he does.  All these guys should quit, right?  No, it's not that simple.  Without giving anything away, they are stuck in these jobs.  So what should a guy do?  Kill his boss.  That's right, eliminate the problem and the job gets better.  Imagine the three whitest guys you know walking into an all black biker bar, and this is how their hair brained idea begins.  It moves to reconnaissance and into an attempted murder.  The whole time it's funny line after funny line.  Absolutely great movie.
B005O30Y5Y|4.0|None of the movies are as good as the books.  I was disappointed by the final battle sequence in film compared to the book.  It still was a decent movie that captured enough of what the book presents to be entertaining.
B005HSL626|5.0|Bast cure for boredom that I've  found. And I've done a lot of Searching. I highly recommend this App. ALthough I' Dont care for the Score and Rewards they have
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Not much to say.  A good action/SciFi movie for its time.  The quality was fine for me.  It was reasonalby priced.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I love this book. Okay, I'll admit: I'm not done with it. But this is a really good book.[: I got this for my Kindle which I received as a present this morning, and I haven't been able to put it down since. I definitely recommend it(:
B005QBKXSC|5.0|My husband was so excited to get this cd for Christmas.  He loves, loves, loves Daughtry and was just as happy with his latest cd! :)
B004GJYROG|5.0|The all-time favorite movie for every one of my 5 grandchildren.  We have owned a VCR copy since it was first released, which finally wore out.  This replaces our old copy and is as entertaining as it was when new.  Who says you have to grow up?!  We like it as much as they do!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I tried to describe the series to my friends, they found it depressing. I guess being a sci-fi geek, I am used to the Post-apocalypse genre. Easy to read, fast-paced and entertaining, the series is absolutely worthwhile.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I have grandchildren & we have all read all the Harry Potter books.  Every time they come to visit, at some point they pick a movie for us all to watch...this one we did not yet have.  We all find the Harry Potter movies entertaining & imaginative...they seem to be ageless & keep the kids riveted.  The price was reasonable & the movie is now added to our collection.
0740748475|4.0|Binding sucks indeed.<br /><br />But that's easily said.<br /><br />Add The \\"Complete\\" Calvin and Hobbes - the $100 hard cover edition of all the comics to the growing list of classic media being edited by their creators. Apparently, two of the comics have been edited and one removed all together to maintain a more PC viewpoint by Bill Watterson himself. While no official explanation has been given, the two original strips that were altered for this book could be perceived as anti-adoption:<br /><br />CALVIN: Mom, was I adopted?<br />MOM: No, why do you ask?<br />CALVIN: Are you planning to put me to work in a cannery for 14 hours a day when I turn seven?<br />MOM: Of course not!<br />CALVIN: You're not just fattening me up to eat me, are you?<br />MOM: Good heavens, Calvin! Who put all these ridiculous ideas in your head?!?<br />CALVIN: That's right. \\"Ridiculous ideas\\" she called them.<br />HOBBES: Oh, sure. You think your mom's going to tell YOU?<br /><br />In the Complete C&H, the word 'adopted' is changed to 'genetically engineered or cloned.'<br /><br />The second strip with altered dialogue is from 25 November 1988, and originally looked like this:<br /><br />CALVIN: Watch out, Mom. I'm in a bad mood.<br />MOM: Be in a bad mood somewhere else, OK? I'm busy.<br />CALVIN: Hmph! I'll bet my biological mother would've bought me a comic book and made me feel better instead of shunning me like you.<br />MOM: Kid, anyone but your biological mother would've left you to the wolves long ago.<br />CALVIN: Yeah right. Really, how much did you pay for me?<br /><br />In this version the phrase 'my/your biological mother' is changed to 'a good mother,' and Calvin's final bit of dialogue has been altered to: 'Yeah, right. Let's see your training certificate.'<br /><br />Now, perhaps the above could be seen as a slight against adoption, but I don't think editing without explanation is the answer. I believe that all media should be preserved. Warts and all. It shows that the creator is flawed. That at one point in time that flawed creation was also was accepted by the masses, and reveals society as also being \\"flawed.\\" If Mark Twain would've lived to see another century, maybe his liberal guilty conscience would've driven him to stealthily edit all future prints of his work, but would that have been acceptable from a historical perspective?<br /><br />To finish this rant, this strip was not included:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I'm just hypothesizing here, but maybe Bill Watterson was afraid it would drive children who read $100 comic collections printed on museum grade T-saifu cloth paper to jump in the washing machine with their stuffed pets and drown to death.<br /><br />All this being said, I have purchased the books.<br /><br />Rant concluded.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book through the first time I picked it up. And since finishing I have reread more than 5 times. Great job with making the reader play a little guessing game. Didn't love the ending up, wasn't upset with the way it ended either.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Just when you thought your kids would be parked in front of an Xbox all vacation, along comes Settlers of Catan. Took ten minutes to learn, yet tremendous fun. I thought board games were over but I was wrong, and it's great for adults and kids. A \\"must own\\" and I rarely write reviews!
0064430227|5.0|I missed this book when I was the right age to read it or to have it read to me.  I am now a parent of young children, and the publisher of the Polish edition (which is bi-lingual Polish and English) gave my wife and me a copy for the kids.  I am in awe of the cleverness, the wisdom, and elegance of this story.

It holds the Kindle in the right position for watching movies, and the strap holds the cover in place as well as wraps around my hand to hold the Kindle for reading.  Worth every cent!!

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|My wife and I watched this film together.  She fell asleep halfway through it.  By the time it was over, I envied her.  A movie like this should come with a \\"Z\\" rating for \\"ZZZZZZZZZZZ\\"(Snoring).  If there was a point to the story, I didn't get it, and according to the reviews, I'm definitely not alone.  I saw this movie as a rental. so I'm not out a lot of money.  I feel sorry for anyone who actually bought it.  They shelled out 20-30 bucks for what is virtually a paperweight.

0684135051|4.0|This is my first EZ book.  I am a young knitter, in my early 20s, and have enough experience to follow her thoughts fairly well.  If you get her book for instructions or patterns, I find that you will be sorely disappointed.  As this book was published in the 70's, a lot of the information is seemingly outdated and a few of her sweaters, old and not flattering in today's fashion world.  However, I liked this book for the insight it gave into the mind of a knitter 40 years ago.  The progress that has been made in the last 40 years is fascinating.  As a fashion major, it is important for me to look to the past to see the future.  This book, while it may be a bit outdated, is fascinating in the information she unwittingly gives to the knitters of today.    As a negative, I find that her train of thought while writing this book is a little like a long trip with multiple stops along the way.  She eventually gets to where she is going, but she makes a lot of side trips.  As most of my conversations go this way, I can follow along with relative ease, but I can see it getting annoying or frustrating for people who wish to get to the point of the paragraph about circular needles.    EZ's books are legendary within the knitting community, and honestly I'm not entirely sure that she is worth all the hype, but I found interest in the book none the less.  My advice for people who are disappointed with the book, try reading it in a different light, rather than as an instruction book, view it as a journal with helpful tips.  As soon as I did this, I found it to be insightful and interesting.
006117758X|1.0|I read it all, hoping to find a paragraph or two worth reading. No luck. The dialogue, and the attitudes of the characters, certainly were not representative of the era.( BTW I was reared during the Depression and responded to the call for Service).   A bio? I suggest there is much fiction here , especially in the college episodes and the dialogue. On second thought, an overwhelming amount of fiction, written for shock value, in which it failed.  In fairness, I have not read the author`s other works. I may, but I am not in a great hurry to do so.They may be worthwhile.

0553381407|5.0|In the process of reading \\"Toxic Parents,\\" I began to understand for the first time that the \\"problems\\" I had always struggled with in my life were not entirely my fault.  I grew up thinking I was defective and unlovable because my parents abused me emotionally, and in reading this book and processing the information I started feeling like there was hope that I might not be the horrible person I was \\"trained\\" to think I was.<br /><br />This book was one of many I read on my journey of recovering from the abuse, which I wrote about in [[ASIN:B005DRCFC6 The Box of Daughter: Overcoming a Legacy of Emotional Abuse - A Memoir]].  I so appreciate Dr. Forward's willingness to step out of our conventional way of seeing parents as perfect beings, and make it clear that some parents are absolutely toxic to our inner selves, to our self-esteem.<br /><br />I know it's really hard to be a parent, and that most parents do their very best.  I think mine did, too -- they just treated their kids the way their parents had treated them.  But their abuse really screwed up my life.  I highly recommend this book to every reader, even if you don't think you had family issues.  It will help you to see the truth behind the facade.<br /><br />Katherine Mayfield<br />Author of [[ASIN:B008Q19TDE Dysfunctional Families:  The Truth Behind the Happy Family Facade]]

Most standard Bible versions are available for download / offline viewing.   It is fast and easy to navigate.

B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great download for the Kindle Fire. The best part is that it allows you to set the level of your competition when playing against the computer. I am somewhere between a beginner and just bad, so it is nice to be able to play without feeling like a three year old would be better competition or that I am not smart enough to play. As I become better I can raise the level of the computer so it remains a challenge. Download this game, it's free, what do you have to lose?
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|You gotta be kidding!!   Or, maybe it's a comedy masquerading as a drama? Or,I could see it, maybe, as a satirical melodrama?  Update: after writing the above, I read the NYT movie review, which  belatedly informed me that film  was \\"supposed\\" to be funny!!! But, how was I to know?   It's true that I was laughing at some scenes... but only because the script seemed so inept and implausible. Bit confusing, eh?   Something is wrong here. IMHO, in many ways,at least for me,  this film does not pass the smell test. Who is fooling whom?

B005ORVN1Y|5.0|Stinky's review was very accurate, but I'll add my 2 cents. The 5.1 version of Signals is just about worth the price all by itself.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Although Hollywood has jumped on the superhero bandwagon which has made some flukes Captain America is a Very Good and Patriotic Movie(Minus FDR who was aBiggovtLiberalFascist himself)and Evans(Not another Teen Movie) as Cap,but oh well.  The Red Skull is wickedly Cool,the action is good and while the part with Bucky which I should not mention is not true to the Comic it is nonetheless a decent film adaptation with some flaws but worth watching.Besides Cap Fighting Hydra and As in the Comics the Germans it would have been nice in both or perhaps in the next installment(highly doubt it) he would fight RedFascism(Communism/socialism) but being Cap is Apolitical,The Special Features is great with the Creator of Cap(God Rest his Soul) give a interview at 90 years old and some other great features,If your A Fan of Cap you need to see the movie.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I'm just now getting into Jane Austen and have been watching and reading everything I've been able to find.  Pride and Prejudice is a beautiful story of how first impressions aren't always right and how ones pride, if left unchecked, can easily get in the way of happiness. This is not only the best film adaptation of P&P I've been able to find, but the acting is splendid as is the costuming and setting.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle have amazing chemistry.<br /><br />The Blu Ray addition is perfection.  The restoration is very well done.  Color and sound are fantastic.  I, honestly, cannot say enough good about either the film or the Blu Ray edition.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have read a lot of Stephen Kings books and this 11/22/63 rates up in the top 10. I think It and The Stand being his top two, well at least my top two. Without giving any spoilers I thought the outcome could be a little different, yeah it's science fiction but I seen TV documentary on Time Travel. I'll just say I don't totally believe in the \\"Butterfly Effect\\" and leave it at that. When the book started out I thought it might get to be your typical \\"horror\\" book from King, for he borrowed a couple of characters from the book \\"It\\". Though he was just using those characters to build upon the new characters --- Thankfully. The ending was better than I thought it would be for the middle of the book I thought it might have a stupid ending like \\"Under the Dome\\" did (my opinion), but it turned out to be a pretty decent ending. The book might have been long, but it was easy reading in my opinion, but then again I have read a lot of Stephen King books.

0545265355|4.0|Set of books that are hard to put down.  Well written with the right mix of action and storytelling.  The third book really pulls it all together even if the ending could have been more developed. I guess the lead up led the reader to fill in the holes for themselves.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|This is a very clever film. The director Natali is taking up strands from Cronenberg (sorry for the puns) and running long miles with them to create something else. For one thing Natali focuses on the characters and their creation to explore the ramifications of genetic experiment. Right from the first appearance of the \\"human\\" clone it becomes a question of empathy and species identification (note that even when she has grown into a young woman and they have to transfer her to a farm, the male protagonist still calls her \\"it,\\" while the female protagonist calls her \\"she.\\")  The way the film works the characters shows up in two important scenes, when the female geneticist turns on her creation, and the male geneticist (shall we say) dances with his. It's a wonderfully played plot.   Disturbing? Yes. And a perfect new wave science fiction thriller that balances scientific jargon with human emotions. Why can't more sci-fi films be this clever and humane?

B006FLGBGA|5.0|Wow. What an incredible movie. Top-notch talent in nuanced performances deliver an emotionally-involving action movie. Astonishing use of CGI; finally special effects are being used as they are: to the deliver the story, not to impress you with CGI. Compelling and thrilling score by the ever-excellent Patrick Doyle.<br /><br />And Andy Serkis once more proves he is the king of motion capture acting. Is there nothing that man can not do?

B0035WTJFW|5.0|One of my favorite movies that most people have never seen.  Its weird how so many techno things have become reality from this movie, I've always thought it was overlooked as a really impressive piece of work.  The quality on the BR Disc is excellent.  As others have chimed in, the grainy look is intentional in this film (its not a reality tv show!).  One thing, I thought this included both the BR and DVD dics, but it doesn't. The other disc is a making of MR which is cool too.

B0052U59F4|3.0|I loved the contract and the emails. That is absolutely reason enough to read Fifty Shades of Grey. I'm sure the contract was not supposed to be hilarious, but at the moment I read it it was. I still hated Grey at that time. I had tears running down my face as I read the playroom and contract chapter. At that point I felt that the Mr. Grey was all ego. I stress at that point. The title for the book is very appropriate. As I continued to read I discovered some of my initial feelings towards Grey were wrong.<br /><br />I liked the unraveling of Christian Grey. He is an intense character to read. There are so many different layers to him. My curiosity of finding out more about him is the main reason I made it through his book. I would love to read Fifty Shades of Grey told from his point of view. That would be a fascinating read.<br /><br />Anastasia irritated me more than anything. She's very young and naïve. I also hate that she wants Christian, but not his baggage. She also expects him to share his very dark childhood experiences with her when they have barely started a relationship. The relationship is a very new concept for the both of them. She seemed to have some very high expectations from the very beginning. Ana has much growing up to do. By the end of the book she has done some, but she still has a long way to go.<br /><br />A quote from Anastasia to Christian: \\"Have you been playing with the thesaurus again?\\" I would love to ask the author that! I have a list of nearly two dozen words that I have never seen or heard in my life. I'm glad that I read this book on my Kindle and had immediate access to the dictionary function. I found this annoying. I was left with a feeling at times that I was not intelligent enough to read this book. That is a feeling that a books should never give me.<br /><br />Clamber.  Definition of clamber, verb: to climb awkwardly (as by scrambling) to climb, using both feet and hands; climb with effort or difficulty, noun, an act or instance of clambering. This word is overly used. Where was that thesaurus then? Ana clambers in, out, up and into EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Another annoyance that brought the rating down was the phrases and word choices of the characters and the setting. Had Seattle, Portland, Washington never been mentioned I would have thought Fifty Shades of Grey was set in perhaps England, Britain, or somewhere across the big pond. I guess that complaint goes along with the complaint about some of the words used.<br /><br />I have not decided if I will read further into this series. I struggled with this one. I'm glad I pushed myself though. Once I got to Chapter 7 I could not put this book down. Perhaps after a lengthy conversation with the person who recommended Fifty Shades of Grey she can give me a few reasons why I want to move on. I didn't get a strong enough grasp of Christian and Anastasia as a couple to want to jump into the next book. There were many aspects I loved, many I liked, a few annoyed, and there were bits that I absolutely hated. Fifty Shades of Grey is emotional not only for the characters stumbling into a new relationship, but for the readers as well.<br /><br />And now we will move on to the very disturbing Edward, Bella, Jacob and Christian, Anastasia, Jose comparison. It is scary! (I hated Edward and Bella, Ana and Christian are so much more tolerable.)<br />* Edward tells Bella to stay away from him that he is not any good for her. Christian does the same with Ana.<br />* Bella's mother is a bit flaky and gets stability from the men in her life.

Ana's friend Jose wants to be more than friends and Christian has jealous tendencies because of this.<br />* Bella's junker truck came from Jacob.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|[[ASIN:B004LSO6YI Elena Undone]]<br /><br />A beautiful straight woman, Elena, is drowning in a loveless marriage to a gay-bashing Pastor. Through a chance meeting, Elena learns that true love knows no spiritual or sexual boundaries, as she discovers her soul-mate in another woman. In fact, another beautiful Lesbian woman, named Peyton. Peyton and Elena meet at Elena's Spiritual Counselor's home, initially by chance, then again at a weekly service, where they have a chance to really visit with one another. It is during this meeting that Peyton feels obligated to reveal her sexuality to Elena, more than anything one senses, because of past troubles she has experienced with straight women by withholding the issue. Peyton seems surprised that Elena has no problems with Peyton's revelation, and in fact Elena seems more determined than ever to become closer and closer to her. It seems that Peyton even tries to pull-back a bit, possibly to see if Elena is serious and not just pursuing the relationship out of a sense of curiosity. I felt that Peyton had indeed had a love affair with a married woman in the past, and that this past love broke Peyton's heart. We can only imagine the possible scenarios. But no matter, Elena is not going away and she pursues Peyton just that much more, even showing up at her door without notice when Peyton stops returning Elena's calls. In the end, Elena decides that making love with Peyton is something that she cannot resist, and she and Peyton engage in the most beautiful, sensual and amazing scene of Lesbian love I have ever watched. It is not cheap or pornographic in any sense at all. This is a very beautiful and realistic scene that one finds hard to believe is acting. It is absolutely realistic in every manner. Considering that Elena must listen to her husband's gay-bashing, every Sunday from the Church Pulpit, it is actually strangely satisfying to see the old boy try to \\"figure out\\" what could have gone wrong??! Now as I wrote earlier, these ladies met at, and attend, what seems to be a Unitarian/Style Church, and their Spiritual Leader is a long-time friend of Elena's who I am certain that the Pastor Husband knows nothing about at all. Now that Elena is distanced from her husband, the love between Elena and Peyton continues to grow and Peyton is disturbed when she discovers that she is becoming jealous whenever Elena must be at home. Peyton cannot stand the thought of Elena being touched or even pursued by another, even Elena's own husband. As they both realize how obsessed they are with each other, the love scenes become more frequent but less visible to the audience. The first love scene, as I said earlier, is very tender and believable and it is a testament to both Women that not one moment of doubt exists and there is no separation between actor and character. Moving on, and inevitably, complications do arise between Elena, her Children, her Husband the Pastor, and even a troubling member of her Husband's Church, that threaten Elena and Peyton's future and they both wonder, just what were they thinking when they got into this situation. It is only through the consistently positive teachings of their Spiritual leader, and his insistence that they must follow their heart no matter what, that these two women weave their way through this long series of surprising challenges, both together and at times all alone.  The ending was a surprise to me, although a pleasant one as I reflect back on it. One warning is please do not try to take the story apart. Enjoy it for what it is, a Love story. Bottom line is how one realizes that complications experienced by these two Women were in many ways, no different than complications between straight couples, whenever one person finds a love outside of the marriage. It is always problematic, but necessary, when one is lost in a loveless and negative relationship, be it straight or Gay. By Elena having a negative and Gay bashing Pastor for a Husband, we are offered an opportunity to see how the added wrinkle of his fire and brimstone preaching, could be the added and seemingly insurmountable \\"wall\\" that kills and later destroys any chance of love or reconciliation. Had it not been for Elena's Spiritual Leader and his insistence that Love really \\"must\\" win in the end, Elena may have given in to the pressure and returned to her loveless marriage..  The Documentary style of this Movie seems to bother some, however I enjoyed it as a learning tool. You never lost sight of his influence because you could hear his voice throughout the film.<br /><br />\\"Elena Undone\\" was a must-see film, at least to me, period!

B000003TA4|4.0|There's not much to say about this album that hasn't already been said, but I'm going to join in on the cliche with my first Amazon review.  Nirvana's second album, and first commercially sucessful album, 'Nevermind' was released in September 1991. Blah blah blah. It was the little Grunge album that could.  'Nevermind' is an album that you'll probably either love or hate. There isn't much of an in between. Personally, the first time I listened, I didn't get it. It took two or three listens until I really realized the magic of what has now become one of my favorite albums.  The album is no doubt very overrated. I have no doubt it would be much more appreciated if it were an underground album. But just because it's overrated, doesn't mean that it's a bad album.  Let's go track by track:  1. Smells Like Teen Spirit - The one Nirvana song that EVERYBODY'S heard, especially if they were tuned into the radio in the early '90s. And although it gets old after multiple listens, this angst anthem sounds just as real, raw, and angry as it did the first time I listened, and it drew me in.  2. In Bloom - I've really grown to like this song more as I've listened to it. And the words really go along with 'Nevermind' and it's sucess. It's really catchy, and it'll get stuck in your head. I promise.  3. Come as You Are - This is another one of the more popular songs on the album, and although I love it, it's one of my least favorite songs on the album. The main guitar riff to it is very catchy, and the song itself is great, but as with 'Teen Spirit', the song gets weary after repeated listenings.  4. Breed - One of the three heaviest songs on the album (the other two being 'Territorial Pissings' and 'Stay Away', which I'll get to later). The song doesn't say much that any other Nirvana song doesn't, but it's definitely one to head bang to.  5. Lithium - I go back and forth with this song. I was beginnning to grow weary of this song as well, but when I listened to it again recently, it's really one of my favorite songs on the album. It's really an anthem, and is extremely catchy and fun to sing along with.  6. Polly - A Nirvana song that actually has a story behind it (not that others don't, this one just stands out to me). It's about a story that Kurt had heard of where a woman was held hostage by a man, and used reverse psychology to get of of it. This is one of the slower songs on the album, but it's a really great song, and I dont't see myself getting tired of it any time soon.  7. Territorial Pissings - The heaviest song on the album, in my opinion. But I like it. Not my favorite, though. It starts off with Krist Novoselic singing in a falsetto voice, and then goes into the thrashy feeling that the song has. Another headbanging song, and also one I don't find myself listening to as much.  8. Drain You - Probably my favorite song on the album, for the exception of the instrumental break. I really like how it goes from the almost screamy vocals in 'Territorial' to the smoother vocals of this song. It's just a really catchy tune.  9. Lounge Act - Another one of my favorite songs on the album, but I don't have a whole lot to say about it. The bass part is awesome, and I love it when Kurt changes octaves halfway through the song.  10. Stay Away - Not much to say about this one that I didn't say for 'Breed' or 'Territorial'. Another thrashy, headbanging song, but for some reason I find myself listening to this song more often than the other two.  11. On a Plain - I've really grown to like this song more lately. It's really catchy, and has a really nice vibe to the song. I also want to note real quickly, what's with what happens right before the intro? There's some kind of squeaky-toy sounding thing, and then it goes right into the song. I don't know what led the band to do a lot of things they did.  12. Something in the Way - A really eerie song. It's also very quiet, and I have to turn up my volume to even hear the vocals. I find myself drawn into this song whenever I play it. It's a very nice ending to the album.   13. Endless, Nameless - This is just...no. I don't like this song. I've only really listened to it all the way through a time or two, but it just gives me a headache. Something in the Way is just a really soft ending, and then ten-or-so minutes later, this comes up and ruins it. I don't consider it part of the album. The title of the song pretty much shows you the feeling of the song. Endless.  So, in all...  Favorite Tracks: Lithium, Drain You, Lounge Act  Least Favorite Tracks: Breed and Territorial Pissings (Although I like them. I just had to pick a few). Endless, Nameless.  So, if you've never listened to the album, give it a go. If you have and you like it, listen again, and listen loud. If you didn't like the album or are closedminded against it, give it another try. It takes a few listens to really get it.  Five cool points if you read all of this.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Do i agree with the horrible new changes? No. I hate lucas, but dangit I wanted the star wars saga on blu ray and i guess this is the best we are ever going to get unfortunately, so might as well join the dark side and buy this set if you ever want to see the deleted scenes and high def clarity etc... The changes blow but it's still basically star wars so if you desperately need to see the theatrical versions then buy the vhs on ebay otherwise itll be when hel freezes over..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is not for fun it is also stragiyu and takes paytionts your kids will love this app!!!!!!...   Love it so much..
B004LWZW4C|5.0|This is a very good movie, even though it does not follow the comics to the letter. It was enjoyable, and easily understood.
B005JLN9ZI|1.0|I've noticed the reviews of everyone  saying the same about the album but giving it four stars for free. I think Mr. Drake is very talented! When I bought the album, I thought to myself that this might be a good one since he had 17 cuts on it.  Boy was I wrong! This album is below average for an artist like Drake! I could care less about the songs that's on the album, I listen for the hunger and how well the record is put together. There might be 4 releases from this record but the drive is gone! Having a dream team record label like Cash Money and not having a better production baffles me! Maybe it's time to stop reading the press about how good you are and get back to the humble hip-hop songs that made you hot earlier this year. Sometimes having success to fast can put pressure on you and I believe this might be the case. The more I listen to the album the more he sounds like Craig David to me. I will cut no slack for this album, step it up!
0385535139|4.0|I got tired of Grisham's formula books, but this one really was fun to read. It was predictable in some ways-- but well worth my time. A simply entertaining book. I would recommend it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|We might not have the original versions but I'm not complaining. Episode IV started it all. I think its refreshing to see the new changes.if the uncut versions come out on Blu Ray in the future, I'll pick them up also.
B004MPESSY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! I think that we humans typically love watching movies because in those moments we are transported into a completely new dimension of experience. When the movie has the power to stimulate our emotional cords and keep us at the edge of our seat, wide-eyed, then it is definitely a good movie. \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" is just the movie that I had been yearning to see! A move that had the power to keep me glued to the television screen, not wanting to go to the restroom, even though I had the ability to press the pause button!   The movie starts off with a beautiful young woman who just wants to get out where there are no disruptions,distractions or interuptions; away from the hustle and bustle of the city, simply to concentrate on writing her next novel. On her way to the cabin that she rented, she has to stop and pump gas. As she pumps gas she attempts to get help with directions from the guys who are attending the gas station. Being a small town where there is nothing to do, the attendants seem a little odd, not familiar with outsiders or how to interact with them. They find out where she is staying and end up showing up and violating her. The rape scene is very intense, lasts for quite some time and can be rather disturbing, definitely not easy to watch. Yet, as I continued to watch, I started to realize exactly what the movie producer was doing, why he or she was giving so much emphasis to that particular scene. The length and violent nature of that scene helps to build this tension within the viewer, this sense of acute anger, of frustration, this sense of wanting to do something to help her this poor girl. The scene completely pulls you in and you totally forget that it is only a movie; and that is the magic of a good movie!   What you feel for the perpetrators is the catalist, the primer that enables you to enjoy the sweet revenge that is surely to come during the rest of the movie. I was amazed at the ingenuity that the girl expressedin her contraptions, designed to get each of her perpetrators back for what they did to her. I won't give away the details, but I loved the last revenge plot, and how she executed her payback. What made it really cool and interesting was that she got her chance to say back to them,to each one of her attackers, exactly what they had said to her as they were raping her and she pleaded for her life.   I hope that I didn't give out too much, but this is definitely a movie that I recommend for adults who want a good nail-bitter to watch!
B0055SWM08|5.0|A good game for the price, and a great way to entertain yourself on the toilet. Better than reading the back of a shampoo bottle.
076115728X|5.0|This creative, interactive book is great for kids from three to about seven.  My five-year-old niece loves it.  It's fun to read to her and she can now \\"read\\"  it for herself because it's simple and easy to memorize.  It's nicely made and very clever.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Awsome movie. Never seen anything like it. Loved the originality, and it has a great cast. Might be a little gory for some people, but still worth watching. Definitely one of my favorite movies.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|A fine wrap-up to a show that should have gone longer.  Joss Wheaton & his cast did a great job.  I am well pleased
B005HIEFC4|5.0|This was a very cute movie with great cameos. Justin and Mila played off each other very well. A couple scenes had laugh-out-loud quotes. Very enjoyable.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I would recommend this book about a fascinating visionary. He was a complicated broken man who we owe our gratitude.<br /><br />I did get tired of the childish and borish behavior of Steve but that's the man, not the author.<br />It's amazing how much very talented people would put up with from this guy.
B003CN4R74|4.0|Amy Lee's voice is not like anyone else out there. She's amazing at rocking out and also soft ballads. Her piano playing isn't too shabby either. Anyway, I love the first song on this album and its gotten some significant airplay. I dont really think any other song on the album is as catchy as \\"what you want\\". Actually, a lot of the songs kind of sound the same. I might sound like I dont like it but I do, its just not as diverse as the prior albums.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|A decent movie faithful to the book. If you enjoyed the book, you will find the movie to your liking. On the other hand, \\"The Help\\" provokes reviews that have nothing to do with the movie. Or do they?  To my delight and satisfaction, I recently viewed, \\"The Help.\\" The movie adhered to the book without embellishment or editorializing. The casting was brilliant the visual capture of the times accurate and not the least distracting. I was especially enthralled by the fashions and automobiles which rendered me incapable of judging the story from a modern perspective; a neat trick.  Then I read the reviews on Amazon. To a person, they attacked or commented on the story, not the movie.  Do viewers or readers have a right to attack a story of the author's invention?* I don't know that I have the answer. I have visited writing clubs that focus only on the story and never on the writing. I leave those groups instantly. I feel the story is owned by the person who imagined it. It is their vision, not that of the reader or viewer.  Am I wrong? Is the random reader rather than the author to be the final arbiter of the story? In the case of the book, \\"The Help,\\" was it accurate? Well, it depends on your point of view. My articulate and literate friend Sonia is from the South and experienced that specific time and circumstance. She told me the story only skimmed the surface of the horrors and turmoil experienced by the blacks during the time depicted and that she enjoyed the book for that particular story.  The improbability of the author gathering the protagonists as represented in the book is very low yet did not distract her from enjoying Stockett's rendering of the events. Sonia also had the perspective of the whites who employed `the help.' My friend, Doris, on the other hand, told me the book was accurate and a fair representation of that time. She never lived in the South nor does she have black friends who were `the help.' To her, the book resonated with her particular view of that history. For Sonia, it did not. Which of the two gets to validate the book/story?  How is either opinion relevant to Ms. Stocketts telling of the tale she decided to relate? Are not her creative efforts and the artistic license she invoked not her choice? Her product? I am forced to wonder if \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" or \\"Diary of Anne Frank\\" would ever have been written had the reader been allowed to determine which parts of the story are accurate or to be incorporated into the tale. Is it not the job of the author to portray realty as they see it and for the effect they hope to create? There are few white people who would give credence to Ralph Ellison's view of white America in the 60s. And those views did not, do not, erase the impact of the stories, nor should they.  I once wrote a short story about an 11 year old girl who experienced sexual abuse in her younger years and hence, related to adults in a mature-for- her-age manner. Her constant vigilance and adult-like commentary are entirely consistent with sexually abused children. My reviewers told me no eleven year old would see what she saw the way she saw it nor would they react that way. Is it my job to educate the ignorant reader that that is exactly the way a bright eleven year old would react and behave when sexual abuse is part of her world view? No. Absolutely not. And it is not Ms. Stockett's responsibility to defend her story. It is her story.  If the viewer or reader is in a position to control or edit what the author chooses to relate and who will read it, will there be any unique stories left to write? Is that not what an anonymous review hopes to do? Is the reader so naive that they believe \\"Schindler's list\\" is an accurate portrayal of events? Or is the reader to surmise the story is merely a representation of what the writer perceives and choses to convey? Can a 90=120 minute movie or 300 page book be expected to be an accurate history that covers all points of view? Or is that the opposite of what fiction and novel writing is all about?  Disagree? Many will. My position is simple. If you don't believe the story conforms to your view of reality, stop reading/watching. It is not the purpose of a book or movie to be an accurate portrayal of your reality. If you want a factual portrayal, seek out a documentary or history; which is no doubt tainted beyond your detection. But when you volunteer your commentary on a creative effort, is it not wise and appropriate to respond with your reactions to that unique portrayal and not the story?  Do we not assess Bogey and Hepburn traveling on a small boat in treacherous waters in terms of the art form rather than the probability of a spinster on her own hooking up with an erasable river rat? Can we not afford today's authors and movie makers the same respect?   *Not relevant to this discussion is who owns this story. That is played out in the courts as you read this. The point is not affected by the details of the law suit.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Received item within promised delivery date. Item is as described and functions as stated. Good product and appears to be a reliable company.
B0015AARJI|4.0|It's a flipping controller, not a game. Anyway, sure, it performs well, but I'm a bit irked by the fact that Sony has so much control over the prices. This junk is SO expensive, only because Sony makes the only good controller, and they try and void your warranty if you use anything besides Dualshock (This has happened to me. Thanks a lot, Pelican.) #OccupySony
B004KKX80A|5.0|Is low on spin power but is all types of Beyblades (stamina, balance, attack, defense). This is the best bey I've ever used!

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Popcap doesnt seem to care about the issues it has. I emailed  them and they gave me some answer that didn't even make sense. I was told when it first came out that they were fixing the save bug but it still exist and completely unplayable on the galaxy nexus. going to request a refund on this one ave support another game developer.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I am really impressed with this CD; it's very well done and great to listen to.  Great for a first CD!

B005K17RU0|5.0|I loaded this and added 5 locations on the first day I opened my fire.  It worked right away. The visuals are easy to read and very intuitive.  I like being able to quickly view extended forecasts in various parts of the US.

B003L77GGK|5.0|Great show, the brothers beat the crap out of evil! I'm watching it now. It comes on tv daily at 10:00 am EST Mon. thru Fri. On TNT, and on the CW Fridays at 9:00 pm EST, don't miss it, I never do, or check it out here on Amazon.com or Hulu, and buy all the seasons on DVD so you can watch anytime, plus have a great collection of a great show cause it's great. Thank You
B00667KMUO|4.0|I have all the Harry Potter movies but this one, all special edition ones.  So, I want this to complete my collction, yet this is so expensive.  WHY?  It's older technology than blue ray so it should be cheaper yet Amazon wants to charge a fortune.  I don't get it?? Why so much!
B006JJ9JE4|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I can't wait for season 2. Which I am sure there will be one. Everyone that I know that has watched it loves it as well. The Hampton's scenery is also breath taking. I purchased all the episodes and downloaded to my kindle fire and watched them on my bus trip to and from work each day.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is ab ok game.  too hard some. tine. oh well it fun you should down load it you will like it
1416583432|2.0|As someone who loves dogs and is in the psychotherapy field (my dogs work with me)...I was VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  Sadly, I would not recommend this book to anyone because I think the author could have done a much more interesting book.  Instead, I thought it sounded like a researcher, not a person who loves dogs.  THERE WAS VERY LITTLE THAT GRABBED MY ATTENTION....I read it to the end hoping it would improve....TOO BAD...IT DIDN'T.  P. LESLIE
B000X107GI|5.0|I cannot believe how inexpensive these are to buy through Amazon.  You get five for the price of 1 at my local drug store.  I have several items that require this small battery and I have been buying through Amazon for a while.  Highly recommend this way of purchasing.  The vendor that Amazon uses is very reliable.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Everyone I had spoken to about this book had warned me about the first 100 pages. \\"It'll take you forever to get through that. But once you've done it, you'll be hooked!\\" I purchased this book after it was recommended (read: I was coerced!) by my mother, sister, and cousin to read it, and I am certainly glad they pressured me to do so. It was always on my radar to read it, but because I am a slow reader and am intimidated by the potential idea of hard-to-read books, I had postponed reading it a few times.<br /><br />What they said about the book is true though. Getting into the book can be challenging because of the Swedish names and locations, but the author did a very good job of going into great lengths to explain things in detail so that the reader is truly never really lost. If you've started reading it and have put it down, give it another chance.<br /><br />I have heard conflicting things about the book, but mostly positive.  There are events in the book that feminists will not be happy about, but think I can understand what the author was trying to convey even if may have come out wrong to some.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the book is griping and it's a fascinating tale. I have tried not to talk much about the book because the true nature of it is revealed later on, so I don't want to go into too much detail. Get through the beginning and make a decision for yourself!<br /><br />I gave this book 4 stars because at times it felt a bit wordy and long, but all in all I'd rate this a 4.5. Steig Larsson was an incredibly smart writer and i was impressed on multiple occasions on how much he knew.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|7.1 Surround Sound is great to tune your AV system.  Move is okay too. Plan to purcahse this move to demo my new 3600 Harmon Kardon AVR system that I got for Amazon of course.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|The best way to really judge an act is by watching or listening to live recordings. Many times I have been disappointed by live performances, but Adele proves she has what it takes. She's the real deal. You will not be disappointed.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I'm not a very big pinball fan, but my dad is and now he stays on my kindle fire a lot. the graphics are outstanding. I love the backgrounds u can choose from. its an all around great game and works perfect on my kindle fire (((:
1451627289|5.0|I have not been a fan of Stephen King for a long time, but this book intrigued me.  I was very glad I downloaded it onto my Nook.  This book was not in the horror genre, but more of a historical fiction.  I could not put it down.  Well worth the price; almost 700 pages.  It really makes you think about how we all affect the universe.  Highly, highly recommend.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It is too ad free! Quit complaining! yeahh so they might have a couple angry bird ads but there's a way to make them stop. when ur game is paused and there are ads just look in the bottom right corner of the box and there is a pig with a sack of mail ... just touch him and BAM! its magic. sheesh don't make a big deal out of it, its so worth a dollar! I would pay a lot more for this game. nice quality on the kindle fire also! :)
B002ZG983M|5.0|I think this movie is made for the 18-40 year old range and generally anybody else that enjoys silly yet well choreographed action.  I really loved this movie and have seen it several times.  It has the same feel as a sin city and with the exception of a couple of really unrealistic cheesy parts, it is really good.  I especially enjoy the soundtrack, the youth feel, and the action sequences with Nicolas Cage.  Do not watch this if you don't enjoy silly humor.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Why are people giving one star reviews just because there hasn't been an update recently? Harsh! Its worth the dollar, the game is addicting and cute:) not for.little kids at all! it requires a lot of thinking
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I love the feeling I get when I walk out of the theatre after seeing a really surprisingly great movie.  I couldn't believe how good this was.  The action sequences and the story line all built up into an amazing final sequence.  I don't know if I have ever looked forward to a sequel like I am looking forward to this!!  I feel that half of the bad reviews on here are due to people not being able to handle direction with a documentary camera feel.  It makes me feel bad that they didn't give this a chance :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the graphics are ok and some of the games are childish. great game other wise. tons of fun games. super addicting.
B003L77GHE|5.0|I absolutley LOVE this tv show, and urge you if you haven't watched it before then watch it...it is well worth the time.<br />As for the blu-ray edition, the picture quality is amazing...

B00005JPCF|1.0|I bought this for Christmas for my four year old..... The movie starts out saying somthing about \\" You dont have to be beautiful to turn me on baby!!!\\" Seriously? How come all kids movies involve love and sex THEIR KIDS
B0043ISH6O|5.0|I got this album having purchased the 2-CD set \\"Ghosts\\" by NIN and pretty much all the NIN albums there are to go along with that over the years. I loved \\"Ghosts\\", comprised of instrumental sketches that weren't meant to be songs but impressive, vocal-free sketches.<br /><br />On to the \\"Social Network\\" soundtrack, I thought I was in for a round of \\"Ghosts\\" Pt. 2. I have to say I was wrong by a long shot; it's easy to say the 2 albums are so much alike because they're both instrumental but the sound, the intensity, and the composing set the 2 apart.<br /><br />With this soundtrack, I was surprised at how well thought-out and complete each song sounded; the songs didn't even need vocals. At times the songs reminded me of the instrumentals on \\"The Fragile\\" back in his NIN days; other times they sounded like fully thought-out songs that could have been on \\"Ghosts\\" or even the \\"Still\\" EP.<br /><br />This is more than a soundtrack to me, this is Trent Reznor (along with Atticus Ross), showing that he's not abandoned his abrasive guitars, industrial tendencies, or his talent to make ambience have a brooding urgency. He still maintains to create beautiful, delicate piano driven songs with gloom brooding around them.<br /><br />People who love NIN's instrumental stuff, this is a must have.<br /><br />People who want vocals should still get this because it's great with or without Trent on vocals.<br /><br />If you don't know anything about Nine Inch Nails, you might not enjoy this as much because of the characteristics that usually go along with a Reznor project. In this this case though, I really think this one is universal to all.<br /><br />Buy
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it gives you a lot of points for just logging in, but I haven't played it long enough to know how it really is
B0001I561E|5.0|The product arrived within the expected delivery date and was in great condition. I would definitely order from here again.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is a must have.  The music is phenomenal.  The lyrics are memorable.  A wonderful tribute to the spirit of survival post 9-11.  This is a great buy.
B003L77TZI|3.0|So by now you have probably heard that \\"Teenage Dream\\" has spawned 5 number 1 singles and 6 top 5 singles, the most from any album from a female artist ever. Now you would think that the othher six songs not released as singles would be just as catchy and just as fun and upbeat, but sadly, that is not the case. I found myself confused as to how bright and peppy songs like \\"California Gurls\\" and \\"Last Friday Night\\" can be on the same album as \\"Pearl\\" and \\"Not like the movies\\", which are very heavy and dark ballads. I'm not saying that I didn't think Katy Perry could pull of songs that go deeper than drunken parties and making love like teenagers, but I don't think that those songs are her finest moments. Now, it should as no surprise that teenagers, particularly girls, will love the themes of self-empowerment and not letting another dull your shine, but if you're looking for those types of songs executed with sharp precision and outstanding vocals, you might be better off buying a Taylor Swift album. But regardless of those few distracting moments, \\"Teenage Dream\\" as a whole is decent, and I don't regret buying it, but beware, not every track is club-worthy, you'll have to grin and bear it sometimes.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This runs fast on my kindle  like on my droid incredible. I love it, just as good as the original angry birds title.
B00000K0EA|5.0|\\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" opened on the very same day as the extremely popular \\"Titanic\\", but still has managed to go on being a Bond film that was well received by both critics and fans alike. Raking in a remarkable $333,000,000 at the box office Pierce Brosnan (in his second outong as Bond) tries to stop a maniac from creating World War III. Filming locations include Vietnam, France and Germany and features a pre \\"Desperate Housewife\\" Terri Hatcher in one of her biggest film roles as a Bond girl. Others in the cast include a very creepy Jonathan Pryce as the villin Carver, Judi Dench as M and Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I wasn't so sure about the book at first. I'd read all the reviews, thought about it and decided to pick something totally out of my typical genre. I'm so glad I did! The book had a mystery feel to it at the beginning and just got more exciting from there. The characters were well developed throughout the book and left me guessing more than once before the end. What an exciting end it was! I would recommend this book to anyone that would like an exciting read. It doesn't leave you hanging, but it looks like there could be a sequel in the works...
0060873027|1.0|I am probably being too picky.  I was hoping for something little more believable.  I would read a passage and ask myself 'How can these people survive?'.  If you shrink a person by a factor of 100 linearly, oxygen and water molecules would have a relative size of 100 times the width of the molecules these bodies can handle.  The molecules could never pass through the walls of the intestines or the lungs.  They would have suffocated almost instantly.    Asimov solved this issue by having the Proteus be a sealed environment, so the crew had air to breathe and water to drink.  When they need to top up the air tanks, the intake had a miniaturizer in the stream to shrink the incoming molecules.  (This wasn't in the movie, but that's Hollywood.)  Hogan's Bug Park did away this miniaturization by having nano-machine with virtual reality.  This gave the same type of view without the superscience and tossing out of common sense.  This will be made into a movie, obviously.  It reads more like a screen play.  I may see the gee whiz special effects in the theater.  (That's what I did with the equally bad Timeline.)  I will not keep a copy of this book in my library.

B0041I0N9A|5.0|Whoa this is one massive incredible Lego build. Without a doubt this is the largest Lego I have ever built. But darn it, this thing is so cool.<br /><br />I can't think of a single other Lego kit that is cooler than this one. The detail is amazing, the kit looks fantastic built. In fact, it is probably one of the more &#34;lifelike&#34; kits. Lifelike is a manner of speaking, it looks so much like the images in the Star Wars films.<br /><br />The detail is fantastic. The two wings have a crank on the back to raise and lower them. The cockpit opens and closes. The stand is impressive.<br /><br />This is not a particularly difficult build. A big table is critical, once the subassemblies start coming together this takes up a lot of space. Thank goodness Lego has done a great job organizing the bags of parts. It's pretty easy to find the correct part out of the five bazillion parts in this kit. There are four instruction books. Each one builds a major subassembly of the Shuttle.<br /><br />I recently built the large Space Shuttle kit. That was much more complex than this one. I would say any solid Lego Maniac should be able to put this together. Although Lego labels this 16 years plus, if a twelve or thirteen year old has been building kits for a while, this should pose no problems at all. Sometimes it takes two people to manipulate the craft and attach parts. The stand is so darn cool.<br /><br />Three of us completed this build over three days, maybe a total of 10 hours build time.<br /><br />I am always amazed at Lego's quality control. In an over 2,000 piece kit, there were absolutely no missing parts and the leftovers were about 15 tiny pieces. Simply incredible.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really love this app. Accessable from any device. I have it on my phone, computer, and kindle. Highly recommended for organizing your to do, shopping, and reminder lists.
B005WM6RUS|5.0|I have held off from reading this book because of its sad element, but when I saw the movie trailer and then heard the author is coming to Montreal, I knew I wanted to read the book. Although this was a sad story, I truly loved reading it. The author succeeds in interweaving a modern story with one that takes place 60 years prior. She captivated my interest throughout.<br /><br />Julia Jarmond, an American journalist married to a Frenchman and living in Paris discovers the shameful Vel' d'Hiv' event that took place in France in 1942. As she investigates, she discovers a long-held secret connected to her in-laws and to Sarah, a girl who was torn from her home in Paris in 1942 and sent to a concentration camp. Julia's probing and tenacity to learn more about Sarah gives her courage to face her own issues and her husband's infidelity and to bring about changes in her life.<br /><br />The short chapters alternate between the two time periods and for me this eased the heavy sadness of Sarah's heartbreaking story so that I felt I could absorb it better in little chunks. It also built suspense, kept me turning those pages at break-neck speed and culminated well with Julia's story.<br /><br />This story is beautifully written, flows well, and offers the reader a historical look at yet another horrific, and perhaps not so well-known event associated with the Holocaust. An absorbing and compelling read. Highly recommended.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|This cheap does not beat my intel 3960x's and that's to be expected.  $1200 vs $200 range would explain that.  But what impresses me about the FX6100 is how close it comes in some ways to the 3960x, it really takes some rugged use before you can see why the 3960x is a chip that whips AMD right now.  With that said;<br /><br /> Most users never put their machine through what makes a 3960x worth the $1200<br /> and not everyone of my PC's need to do what my power machines do.  This is my chip, and I'd love to try the 8core one day.<br /> One thing to note: UNlike the intel extreme editions, these chips clock down unlocked core usage, or so I have read.<br /><br /> Regardless, I love the system I built with this chip, and considering the price difference is tremendous, am to no end impressed.  AMD promised a bit more with these chips than delivered (that is the opinion of most tech savvy types, and people in the industry I talked to) but one thing we all agree on is there is no better value for the money than this chip.<br /><br /> Love it, and I think you will too.
0316017922|5.0|book is a must for all self employed people and it explains a lot of great people and their place in our history . Also answer a lot of thought about why things are as they are in our every day lives .
B005HSL626|3.0|Good game, but they should offer the pomegranate (multi-slice fruit) update that they offer for apple devices; really adds to the gameplay.
B005ZMUQCK|4.0|Good graphics, engaging animation and storyline. Kind of long, and could do without the innuendos (though there are but a few). Prefer a plot for kids that doesn't involve romance, which this one does. Movie does however teach a good lesson.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Wow. With all the bad reviews, I almost passed on this one, but this is a perfect execution of the old Atari games that started it all. They give you 9 free games exactly as described that are exact duplicates of the originals. Try it before you review it and rate it according on how well it meets the description. The ones you pay for are cheap as well. Cheap devices won't work well here, because you have to touch two spots at once.
B004FOA84A|3.0|From the start it was hard to play.  You can't get to some of the clues because they are behind something else or an instruction. Unfortunately, there are no hints or help on how to proceed.  So, after paying for a game you cannot continue...if this keep happening I guess I won't be buying anymore. No clue on how to get to the shiny object and no clue about the key in the steps.  What a downer.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app to track any and all thoughts that come into my head. works great like a charm!
1931559317|5.0|This atlas is packed full of info and things to see in the night sky. It's not for beginners such as myself. It's an atlas, not a how-to. I'm sure I will grow into this as I continue to observe and learn.
B005KELQEU|3.0|I put this on my wish list because I wanted something that I could put my Kindle Touch with the leather lighted cover into.  The reason is because Amazon's lighted cover is rather nice and I didn't want to scratch it up.  Also, the downside of Amazon's cover is that there isn't any strap or anything to keep the cover closed.  So, I wanted something else to put it all in so that everything would stay protected in my bag.  This product did not fit my needs.  Mainly because this cover fits the exact dimensions of the Kindle Touch so there is no room for anything else.  Also, the lighted cover adds a couple of inches to the top of the kindle (because that's where the light is located) so that was sticking out the top of this cover.  Ended up having to return this item.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Excellent
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are harder than others but overall fin to be had. Def helps pass the time. Worth playing over and over.

B005Z271Y6|5.0|If you like Adele, you will LOVE this show. I also love that it came with a CD so I can listen to it in the car. It's a MUST buy!!
1427646341|3.0|I own several audiobooks that deserve five stars, but this gets a three beause of the two reasons listed in this review title. I have read & loved other of her books & loved the movie of this book, but have not read this one, therefore did not realize that it was not written as well. Though I like the reader of every other fiction audio book that I own, I did not enjoy this reader. I tend to listen to an audiobook at bedtime & this reader's harsh, sometimes abrupt delivery is more stressful than relaxing. It may serve well for listening to while driving.
B006O3MU96|5.0|I love this game for kindle fire! I put on a catchy song and jump to the beat. ;) Very ADDICTIVE game here!!!

B003YL4LYI|2.0|His books get longer and longer but have less depth, and story. You'll get entire pages dedicated to family members they will never mention again. It's like reading early chapters of the Bible... and Mzdahr, begat Lothar, who begat Hizdahr, whose second uncle was a great man of the fishing provincies and had three brothers named.... WHO CARES!!!!  I find myself skipping entire pages. He does the same thing with descriptions of places, explaining every wall in a room, Ok I get it,flesh out your story. Don't write a movie, including screenplay, and set design all in one. Needs to seriously learn how to edit out the crap or the for the next book I will only be reading the Cliff's Notes version.
B003L77GGU|4.0|Season 6 of Supernatural was slow to start. The show felt different with new people running the show. Well, not really new as they were with the show for some time now. But the creator of the show stepped back from running it. So the first several episodes has a different fell. But after they got into the season, everything starting taking shape and this was a very good season. Supernatural look excellent in blue ray and the sound is always top notch as well. Plus Amazons deals can't be beat!
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Great free app, but there isn't a screen that shows captured pieces.  For a novice. Chess player though, it is great.
B004LUS390|5.0|Very fun, not so great for photoshop-style photo editing, but exellent for drawing and doodling. I reccomend it if you want to leverage your device's touchscreen. Kindle Fire
B001676320|5.0|I just purchased Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire on BD from Amazon.  WOW...WHAT A GREAT CONCERT!!!  The positive energy generated by these two bands during there onstage performances   is so infectious that the viewer can't help but to get caught up in the excitement.  If your having a bad day pop this BD in your blu-ray player and hit play.  You'll feel better immediately!  Picture and audio quality are both great.  Especially the DTS-HD Master Audio.  Turn up the volume on your AVR to \\"reference level\\" and it's like your center stage   at the Greek Theatre for this spectacular concert!  I'am a fan of both bands but didn't think they would mesh together well on the same stage.  Boy was I wrong!   It was amazing at how seamlessly great both bands sounded when they played together onstage.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I really enjoy having the ability to set the difficulty on a sliding scale instead of the standard easy/medium/hard. I also feel the AI difficultly really matches the scale. I'm probably going to buy the full version.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Great family strategy game. Others have discussed the mechanics, but I'd echo how intensely strategic and interpersonal the game can be. Perfect length at 45-75 minutes per game.   Only gripe is the board, which is basically made out of normal cardboard and thus prone to warping if any piece gets wet or bent. This can make it nearly impossible to set up the board.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I feel so organized!  I have only been using this app for about a week but I am already dependent on it!  Love that I can save any type of note, picture, recipe, online shopping receipt, webpage, etc, etc, etc, and access it from my phone, pc, notebook or any future device I might purchase.  Give it a try!
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|These books are awesome! However, if you want to buy them for your Kindle then I strongly recommend buying the ebooks individually. As others have said, the font sizes changed randomly (and even the options would change so I couldn't get it back to the same size I was reading yesterday..?). Also, I thought I was buying the set of three books as individual Kindle files but this is one big file. Some people may like that, but I'd rather not have to go into a table of contents to choose which book to look at. But again, the books are great so far!!
B001AFF25W|4.0|I think the puporse of these type of self-help books is to supply the reader with a simple philosophical approach to life that can be swiftly and easily implemented without taking a wrecking ball to your current lifestyle. Very few authors are successful at doing this.  Brian Tracy hits a homerun with this book. Sure, the book doesn't reveal some ancient secrets of productivity from some lost civilization of demigods (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars), but it does present various systems of approaching procrastination in a straightforward way. And you will see results. By setting priorities and eating your frogs you'll get things done and your forward moving momentum will thrust you into the next level. It is amazing how much you can accomplish when you don't procrastinate.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|beware this app is extremely addictive unless you have the eagle ( I do) it can also.be very frustrating but worth it
1451627289|5.0|This book was riveting. I started reading King books as a young adult, but stopped reading them at some point, deciding they were too creepy. I'm glad I gave this one a chance. It is the best book I have read in a long time and I often read 3-5 books per month. It was worth the price and more!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|fruit.ninjas is one of the top games I play on my fire it is defintley worth $0.99 to buy awesome &quot;app&quot;
B005FMB8X6|5.0|Im a stingy 5 star giver.    its gotta blow me away.  This re-release does.  If you are reading this you know the album.  Its an old friend.    I would say if you only listen to it once this recording is well worth the price of admission to \\"hear\\" and old friend and not just go back in time, but hear it as it should.    The discrete presentation of so much detail brings it all together.    It breath's now!  it needed a bigger stage, now it has it.
B003TT2X72|5.0|Buy it on Blu-Ray.  At Christmas time, I was able to buy the trilogy for an ave of $7.50 each.  A must have.  This trilogy is easily at the level or better than the original Star War Trilogy.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|This case is the perfect accessory for my kindle touch. It protects the kindle from scratches and the rain. I like the color choices.

B003JA5MO2|5.0|I just opened my vinyl copy of MOJO and I am blown away by how good it sounds. The music is awesome and Petty delivers a solid set of vocals. A plus is the MP3 download that goes along with the record. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Tom Petty and the blues.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I really loved this.game!!! ot was really hard and puzzling and I used cheats a few times but over I give it 5 stars!!!.IM REALLY HOPING FOR A SEQUAL &quot;FIRE MAPLE GAMES&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B005FITIK0|5.0|We all know a woman like Mavis Gary. She's the kind of girl who everyone feared in high school, who was always effortlessly beautiful, and yet she had no personality whatsoever. She would do whatever was thought to be \\"cool\\". Her loved-but-feared status meant that she probably barely registered your existence at all. We assume that this kind of woman goes on to do great things, and becomes an amazing person who would have a whole new generation of people fearing her, but that is not always the case, and that is where we meet Mavis, in \\"Young Adult\\".     Diablo Cody will forever be known for writing 2007's hip-dialogue laden and instantly memorable \\"Juno\\", a somewhat controversial teen comedy, which served as a star vehicle for Ellen Page, ensuring that she will play rebellious teenagers well into her thirties. Diablo Cody has reunited with her \\"Juno\\" director, Jason Reitman, for \\"Young Adult\\". I would like to mention that aside from auteur moments in Cody's writing, this is nothing at all like \\"Juno\\", and that's a good thing.      \\"Young Adult\\" is the study of a borderline psychotic personality. It's the story of Mavis Gary, a woman pushing 40, who lives alone, with her obviously neglected Pomeranian, in her disheveled condo in Minneapolis. She is a ghost writer of young adult fiction, which is ironic, considering she hasn't grown up at all since high school. She is not emotionally matured in any way, and thinks that her living in a neighboring city of her suburban hometown means that she has a life. She gets an e-mail from an old high school boyfriend who invites her to a baby-naming ceremony, or something like that. Fully intending to get him back, she blatantly ignores the fact that he is a husband and new father. In her mind, there is something not right in the universe, and she intends to fix it.     We don't really know, as an audience, if we are supposed to feel empathy for Mavis, or if we should just feel pity. At several points in the film, we see Mavis laying face-down on a bed, either in her cold pigsty apartment, or her hotel room, where she appears to be dead. She's never dead, just dead drunk. Her character says to her parents at one point, \\"I think I might be an alcoholic\\", and the statement is largely ignored. Anyone who says this aloud knows damn well that they are, and the fact that her parents ignored this statement shows you what kind of family this woman came from. Mavis is definitely an alcoholic, seen repeatedly drinking heavily just to make it through the day. She may as well have been drunk in every scene. This is a study of a depressive character, but the thing that bothered me was that her parents ignored this statement, because they would obviously rather pretend that there is no issue. It's upsetting, but like I said, it shows where this woman became this way. That's good writing.      This film works because the lead character is extremely well written and observed, but also because Charlize Theron knocks this one out of the park. First of all, before I get to any other facts about this character, I must say that Theron plays a drunk very well. The last thing I remember seeing her in was her infamous performance as Aileen Wournos in 2003's \\"Monster\\", and it is going to sound trite, but she's playing a different kind of monster here. She is a woman whose main goal in this film is to break up a marriage. She gave so much of herself to this character, and she may as well be responsible for the film's success. I personally liked Mavis, a character who we're supposed to hate, or feel great pity for, and I give Theron most of the credit for that.      Patton Oswalt, of stand-up comedy fame, plays Mavis's ally in the whole thing, Matt, a guy who graduated with her, who she probably never talked to in high school, yet he is either fascinated by her antics, or just enjoys talking to her, because they become good friends. I know Oswalt from Cody's Showtime series \\"United States of Tara\\", where he also played the kind of character he plays here: the voice of reason to a borderline sociopath. He is a crucial ingredient to why this film is as good as it is, and had to be mentioned.     With \\"Juno\\", \\"Thank You For Smoking\\", and \\"Up in the Air\\", and now \\"Young Adult\\", Jason Reitman has a fantastic track record. I have enthusiastically enjoyed each of his films thus far. It's interesting for me to think of this film as a companion piece to 2009's \\"Up in the Air\\", two films about emotionally stunted individuals. [George] Clooney's character in \\"Up in the Air\\" didn't want to feel anything, and didn't want to get too close to anyone. The film ends with him not exactly changing, but moving forward in his life, ignoring factors that would have emotionally devastated the average person, and just moving forward. Meanwhile, Mavis is irrevocably stuck in the past. The best time in her life was high school, where she was popular and kind of feared, and now she is just pitied. Yet she is obsessed with making her glory days a reality again.      There is nothing warm, sentimental or happy about the ending of this film, let me just say that right off the top. The film itself is dour, bleak and emotionally brutal. The performances are powerful, and the writing is excellent, yet it doesn't have the warm, happy, everything-is-better-all-of-a-sudden ending that American audiences are used to, and that's a damn good thing. Most character studies about unlikable people typically have the antihero change for the better in the end, in an ending where everything is warm, and everyone is left happy, but Mavis doesn't get off the hook that easily. While the film, in a whole, is quite depressing, its brand of black-as-night comedy is refreshing and welcome. I would call it the meanest Hollywood film this year, and that's a very good thing.     Grade: A-
0307949486|2.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo is an okay story. The author is a good writer who has created interesting characters and a good story line However, nothing very clever, nothing very intellectual, no Aha! moments as the mystery unravels. Skip the reading and just see the movie. I will not be reading the next book in the series since this one was boring.
B0032JTV74|5.0|best bluray and season of glee ever  everything came just as promised  love glee, love amazon =D  looking forward to second and third season
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|In my opinion, I think Drake's 'Take Care' album is the best album released in 2011, even though there are elements of R&B ..the feel of this album is incredible. Drake defintely has a good ear for music.. pretty much every track is amazing, real feel good album. If you haven't heard it. Its worth a listen, trust me.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I bought this season ( and the fifth) to catch up on the Supernatural after missing almost two seasons and I am so happy that I did. The show is fantastic and this season is no exception.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The movie accurately shows how short-term profits (which ignore risks) cause problems.  But nobody cares because the short-term profits cause lots of high pay and bonuses, consulting fees, etc.    I loved the photos of Greenspan with Rubin--says it all.  I wish that the judicial system's obliviousness would have been included.  Yes, the movie talks about the ratings agencies and  greedy academics (economists), but what about the judicial system?  You'd think that some local judges started screaming about unbelievable numbers of foreclosures long before 2008.  And what about all the discretionary appeals accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court that ended up favoring the financial industry (not to mention tobacco, etc.)?  Financial entities like Citibank, etc. continually convinced the U.S. Supreme Court to accept appeals on issues \\"of great general or constitutional importance\\" (which were not really of great importance except to the financial industry).  I can't figure out how the whole world just keeps throwing money into Manhattan for \\"management.\\"  You'd think that there'd be some common sense and mistrust by now.  Warning: do not trust people in Manhattan people with your money!

0062101897|5.0|I became a Harry Potter fan when the books first came out. At the time, I was teaching 6th grade, and my students insisted I read them. I was hooked! I own all 7, and many were purchased on the day they were released. I have re-read them numerous times, and have seen the movies too many times to count. The Harry Potter Page to Screen completes the series for me. I loved the details, from characters, clothing, wizard tools, creatures and everything in-between that made Harry's world appear so real. I am saving the books for my grandchildren, and have already watched Sorcerer's Stone with my granddaughter. J.K. Rowling made an important contribution to children's literature, and I am glad I was along for the ride.
1451648537|5.0|[[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]]As a former user of the Apple II through almost every model to my Mac Pro and was a dealer principal for 11 years, it brings back memories of the early days and introduction of the 1st Mac.

0670022705|5.0|Bought A History of the World in 100 Objects for my father this Christmas and he absolutely loves it. Each object has a picture and 3-6 pages of information, making it easy to pick up for 10 minutes or three hours. You can learn quite a bit from this book; it's perfect for History buffs! I highly recommend it.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I love this game.  Very challenging later on, but also very fun!  if you like puzzle games, give this one a shot.
B005BDZN62|3.0|I bought this product as a Christmas gift, and specifically for the book enclosed. A relative was in the movie as one of the Jets, and he was going to autograph the book before I gave the gift. Much to my disappointment, when we opened the book the stitching from the spine also ran across the pages. Not Amazon's fault, that lies with the manufacturer, but a disappointment none the less.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had never read Stephen King until this book. It had been decades since I read a novel that sat at 850 pages in length. My interest came from my interest in the topic: in the 3rd grade when we learned about President Kennedy, I stayed up all night crying because I didn't think it was fair that two kids had to be without their father for most of their lives. I even explored this exact topic in my own high school writing class.  This story follows Jake and a time portal in Maine. It is a book of deep respect and homage to the time frame Jake returns to (1958). The book is full of twists and turns that make two to three hours of reading seem like ten minutes. It also explores the implications of time travel in interesting and very personal ways.  If you're interested in this book primarily for the topic area of the Kennedy Assassination, go into this knowing that MANY more topics and sub plots that have nothing to do with President Kennedy will be explored. I will not get into any more detail here for those of you who plan to explore the book yourself.  IF you get the Kindle extended version with video, do NOT watch the video until after you've read the book.  Stephen King apparently started exploring this book's content in the 1970's and found the approaching 50th anniversary of the Kennedy Assassination was the first time that it was right to move forward. Timing, character development and compelling plot are all extraordinarily beautiful in this great work.

B000007UXS|5.0|LP was packed safely & shipped fast the sound quality is excellent, of course your sound system is a major determination on how well it sounds. I'm a mid-range price audiophile, I'm spinning on a Audio-Technica AT-LP120 USB, to a ONKYO Receiver and I am very happy with the sound. The LP has some great songs, I'm basically addressing the quality of the LP itself not getting into to music as I figure listeners are familiar with it.

0439023513|5.0|Like many others, I was put off this book by so many negative reviews. And I will readily admit: Mockingjay is violent, merciless and depressing. At times, I just didn't want to read it anymore! But my love for the characters kept me coming back. And today, after finally saying goodbye to this trilogy, I can hardly find the adequate words to express my satisfaction. Mockingjay has the most intricate plot of the three books and when it all is said and done, I was left in tears. Buy it... Now!

B004WR125O|5.0|Never has a device so small and affordable added so much value to a product.  Attached the UWFR-1 adapter to my receiver this morning and can now use the receiver through my wireless internet router to receive SirusXM, Spotify, and may other entertainment services online through my stereo receiver.  Really like being able to use the adapter to control my receiver from multiple locations throughout the house; as easy as downloading an Onkyo app for my Droid phone and my cell phone is now a truly remote control.  It's especially nice to be able to power down the unit from my bedroom at the end of the day.  Best high tech gadget to come along in years.

B003Z2LAAO|4.0|The 3D is always good and sometimes excellent in this view of the Grand Canyon. I have read some complaints about this Big Screen & IMAX presentation that say it is too political and preachy -- Really? The idea that a documentary that states that monitoring our water resources is imperative to the quality of life is preachy and political, well, if that is so, then let's have more of it.

B0043RSE2M|5.0|Good movie with very good 3D. Not as good as \\"Monsters Vs. Aliens\\" story (as that film is the best use of 3D in an animated film to date -- And with a story that every fan of 1950's Science Fiction films will really appreciate), yet \\"Despicable Me\\" turns out to be charming and fun. Great for kids and fun for adults.
159562015X|5.0|Makes some very strong points and helps gain insight.  A must read.  Bought for work but got lots out of it.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|I'm giving this gamepad 3-stars only because all of the buttons and \\"thumbstick\\" work as advertised.<br /><br />I thought about giving it a 0-star rating, but only because of one simple flaw. My hand is a human hand since I'm human. That means my thumb is opposable, which means it doesn't naturely work like a finger. Logitech completely failed to take this into account when designing this thumbstick. The thumbstick is a brilliant idea, BUT, it needs to be placed in a manner that is useable for more than 10 seconds.<br /><br />For example, the \\"hat\\" switches on aircraft joysticks sit directly on top of the joystick and not along the side where the rest of your fingers grip it. The thumb naturally rest on top of a joystick, because it is opposable. The G-13 is designed without any thought given to this simple and well-known characteristic in human anatomy.<br /><br />I've used the nostromo and really like it, but I was looking for more buttons and even more comfort. The G13 has the buttons, but fails miserably in the comfort department, unless you never intend to use the joystick (or at the very least, rarely intend to use it).<br /><br />If you're all about the buttons for your fingers, and having 2 spacebars for your thumb, then, this is the board for you. If you want the functionality of a thumbstick, this one will give you cramps in a matter of minutes and will be almost unplayable before 10 or more minutes pass.<br /><br />Good idea, horrible execution.<br /><br />It's a shame. This could be the perfect gamepad with just the smallest tweak. The palm rest is perfect, the number of buttons is perfect and the LCD screen is a GREAT feature and should be implemented on all gamepads.<br /><br />One good thing about this purchase is that it has really made me appreciate my nostromo even with its fewer buttons, if only because it was designed for a human hand.
B006C45MRE|5.0|My 11 year old son loved this movie.  We rented it on amazon and he watched it over and over until it expired.  I myself really enjoy a good western and so I enjoyed that aspect of the movie, but adding in the modern alien parts didn't quite ruin it for me.  It was quite creative and worth a watch.
B000MQ54OY|5.0|I got this for my Wife for Christmas. We had family over and watched it. Everyone loved it old, young and in-between.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  It's really worth taking the time to watch.  There were moments that brought out laughter and other parts that brought out tears.  Now my teen age daughter wants to read the book.
B0064SHI9I|5.0|Does exactly what it says. There is extra benefits when rooted, but nonrooted phones benefit from having texts, calls, and some settings if you ever have to do a hard reset.

B006O5Y0SS|5.0|What an amazing movie!  It opens your eyes to life's realities in a magnificent way!  The way \\"Gil\\" brings his desires of the past into perspective is wonderful.  The leading lady was dreadful, but I believe that is the role they wanted her to play.  Every character did a fantastic job!
B005HSG3U6|4.0|We love this unit and it does what it's intended to do.  I would have liked a screen protector or something akin to an otterbox, but outside of that, it was a decent offering at a decent price.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This story broke my heart in SO many ways! It was beautifully written, with an amazing point of view, and it was so sad, and at the same time so very strong.<br />Mia is a character I definitely want to read more about, she seems like a strong, and lovely young woman. Her Adam is amazing as well, as is her best friend Kim.<br />It is just astounding to read something that is written so close-up to a characters feelings and emotions, while the character herself is so removed from everything else.<br />If I could give more than five starst to this one I would - even with all the tears.
1451627289|4.0|This book was suggested from within my book club and I am finding it quite enjoyable, though I have not finished it yet. My enjoyment is probably due at least in part to the fact that I grew up in the '50's and the book's depiction of 1950's America strikes a chord for me. I've not read a lot of Stephen King, but I like the accessible prose and the way that the 50's are revealed through well-developed real characters rather than the stereotypic bobby-soxers and Elvis fans. It's deeper than that and all the more convincing for it. For me, it's evocative of the time, but in a more realistic way than others have presented it.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Soul Surfer is the kind of wholesome family movie which, tragically, is so rare today. Yet among its many successes, this inspiring and uplifting movie succeeds in proving that it needn't be that way. Here's hoping that Surfer's enormous and well-deserved popularity will finally encourage Hollywood to begin offering us films which encourage the best in society, rather than a constant stream of movies which encourage the worst.   Finally, never forget that, in Him,   The End  ... is just the beginning.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Buble' is up there with this excellent album compared to Andy Williams and Johnnie Mathis. Buble' is today's Johnnie and Andy.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I've been a fan of BSB for over a decade.  I had been disappointed with their last couple of CDs and wasn't impressed with the song samples for this album listed on Amazon.  Despite misgivings I decided to buy This is Us and give it a listen.  All I can say is that I'm extremely happy I gave it a chance and I consider the music on this album to be on par with their previous hits. It turns out that there was too much greatness in these songs to fit into 30 second snippets. This album is more of a dance/R&B album that harkens back to their pop roots as opposed to the ballad cds they've been putting out and it's a fantastic album. Keep an open mind and take a listen to \\"Straight Through My Heart\\" and \\"All of Your Life\\" among the other great songs on this album, you won't be disappointed.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Too bad there are the annoying adds.  Otherwise this would be a great free game.  Get rid of the adds and thus is rated5.
0553385461|4.0|This is my first attempt to wade through any material produced by Stephen Hawking. I am an amateur to this topic so I began reading this material with the expectation that some of this information would go over my head. I was surprised to find that he did a reasonable job in explaining the necessary knowledge and it wasn't until quantum physics was discussed that I began to have trouble. So based on the information itself and some of his nice illustrations I would give this book a very high rating.<br /><br />What held this book back for me was that as I read it, I noticed that he occasionally decided to \\"philosophize\\" about the implications of various subjects like a possible universe with no beginning(or \\"edge\\" as he might describe it), the limitations of a scientific theory, the nature of God, what it would mean if we could not find a unified \\"theory of everything\\", etc. During these brief moments, I couldn't help but to think: \\"Mr. Hawking really needs to consult a few good philosophers before he provides commentary like this.\\"<br /><br />Imagine my shock then, at the end of this book where just pages before he uses philosophy(although, perhaps unaware of it?) to speculate about the ramifications of various theories, that he gives philosophy a major kick to the groin on the last page of the last chapter when he says:<br /><br />\\"...the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as whether the universe had a beginning. However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittenstein, the most famous philosopher of the twentieth century, said, \\"The sole remaining task for philosophers is the analysis of language.\\" What a comedown from the great traditions of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant!\\" pg 142<br /><br />To me this simply seemed as though he felt that philosophy was an unnecessary discipline and could be set aside - even though even he was unable to set it aside in his analysis regarding the significance of pieces of scientific knowledge. He may not have intended to imply such a thing, but this is not the first time I have encountered this perspective among a theoretical physicist. The study of philosophy, logic, and critical thinking are essential to correct and explicable knowledge.<br /><br />This is still a worthwhile read (hence, 4 stars which is the \\"Amazon\\" equivalent to: \\"I like it\\"), but I felt it was necessary to point out an inconsistency on his part.for philosophers is the analysis of language.\\" What a comedown from the great traditions of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant!\\" pg 142<br /><br />To me this simply seemed as though he felt that philosophy was an unnecessary discipline and could be set aside - even though even he was unable to set it aside in his analysis regarding the significance of pieces of scientific knowledge.

B0021L8V0M|2.0|If you're a fan of non-stop action flicks where the plot is neither important nor makes much sense. then you'll enjoy \\"Salt\\". This is a film in the Mission Impossible mold. The action sequences are well-shot and often thrilling, but Anglelina Jolie, as Evelyn Salt, is very much a comic-book hero. She jumps onto a moving truck, shoots her way out of impossible situations, falls out of a helicopter into freezing water, etc., always surviving with a few scratches (and looking gorgeous while she does it).  And of course, she never has to eat or sleep.  The Russians are stereotyped baddies trying to start WW III (how retro!).  There's tons of collateral damage, and of course it doesn't matter if many minor characters are maimed and killed as Salt rampages.  If you want a couple of hours of mindless action with lots of stuff blowing up, then Salt is the movie for you.

B004EPYZUS|5.0|Say what you will about Tom Cruise's off-screen life, but onscreen this man is box office gold, consistently producing hit after hit. M:I GP is the latest in the franchise and it's non-stop adrenaline. I saw it on opening night and left happy. On paper, everything about this film looks good. Directed by Brad Bird (Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, all good movies), produced by J. J. Abrams (Star Trek, Super 8, M:I III) and Cruise (you don't need me to list his film creds, do you?), that's one hell of a creative team. I loved M:III and if you thought the action there was intense, the filmmakers turned it up to 12 for Ghost Protocol.<br /><br />They took the best elements of the entire franchise, trimmed off the boring expository bits, boiled down the rest, and gave us pure M:I brain-melting espionage action. There's really not much espionage and cloak and dagger double-crossy trickery going on to confuse thicker moviegoers. They cut to the chase (quite literally) and stick with action. It's a cold open (skipped credits) with a guy busting through the door on the roof, chased by two bad guys armed with SMGs. (We know he's the good guy because he's handsome.) He pulls some kind of button on his chest, jumps off the roof, and kills his pursuers before landing on his inflate-a-pack. This film has all the movie-going goodness you need: exotic international locales, scientifically impossible gadgets, physics defying acrobatics, car chases (and car crashes), foot chases, fisticuffs, guns, stuff blowing up, and stuff blowing up. Excuse me? Oh, I repeated myself? Here, I'll do it again. Stuff blowing up. Lots of stuff blows up. They blow up the Kremlin. The Kremlin!!<br /><br />The film is filled with very likable and excellent actors. The funny, but typecasted Simon Pegg (Star Trek, Shaun of the Dead), Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker), and the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton round out the cast, with Tom Wilkinson making a cameo (one of my favorite actors). Throw in some Russians, Cold War nuclear tech, and a brilliant but insane (and insanely athletic) middle-aged Swedish guy who wants to destroy the world and you've got a story. If that doesn't sound like popcorn munching good times, I don't know what does.<br /><br />As with all action movies, expect ridiculous, over-the-top action and leaps of logic. Why did Agent Hunt have to cut a hole in the tallest building in the world (Burj Khalifa, Dubai), climb on the outside of it unharnessed with Spiderman gloves of questionable reliability to reach a server room 5 stories up and 30 feet across? Because if he took the elevator, you wouldn't pay $10+ to see that. The action is consistent, interrupted at no time for more than several minutes for some story-telling. There's a fight, a chase, or some crazy stunt probably every five minutes, it seemed, along with some bits of understated humor (supplied mostly by Pegg's character). You get to see some fantastic location shots of Moscow, the UAE, and Mumbai (India) for the finale. The aerials over the Dubai desert and approach, for example, I'll probably never see in real life, so it's a treat to see on the big screen. The car at the end of the movie is off the chain (a BMW concept car)!<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained by this film and enthusiastically recommend it to action fans. Movies aren't cheap in NY ($13.50), but nothing feels quite as bad as wasting not just money, but 2 hours on a bad movie, so I choose what films I watch very carefully. It's made by smart filmmakers who have a solid reputation and delivers a very sleekly choreographed action film without any eye-rolling stupidity. Waiting for the next film in the franchise already!uclear tech, and a brilliant but insane (and insanely athletic) middle-aged Swedish guy who wants to destroy the world and you've got a story.

0671027387|2.0|As a number of reviewers have pointed out in detail, this book has factual flaws and flights of fancy which take it well beyond the normal limit to suspension of disbelief. Some similar, but less jarring, flaws are to be found in his better known books.<br />My ranking for this book reflects my personal reaction. I'm not suggesting that I isn't an enjoyable read on some levels, but . . . 3 stars would mean \\"I like it\\", I must choose \\"2 stars' \\"I don't like it\\".

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Like many other readers, I was caught up on the books since page 1 and I could not put it down until I finished. If you are a perfectionist, you will totally understand his obession, his deamons, and his drive. You will find him simpathetic and grateful that he missed so many social filters, otherwise, he would not have made so many breakthroughs.  I found way too many names in the biography (sometimes referred by their first name and others by just their last name, which is very confusing), and it is hard to follow if you do not know who the players are.  I miss a couple of important parts of his life in this book: the dead of his father and the born of his children. By knowing how he felt in each of these moments would make us closer to him.  In general, an inspirational book with many flaws that seems that the book was rushed to be published and take advantage of Jobs' death momentum. Nevertheless, a must read if you want to get into the mind of a genius.

B004EPYZUS|5.0|To me it has always been the theme song. I could watch just about anything to that sound track and think it was great. Fortunately we had a great film that explodes on the big screen. The gadgets were extremely high tech and I seriously doubt many of them really exist. Face scanner in a contact lens?<br /><br />The opening scene of Cruise in a Serbian high security prison being broken out, was superb. It becomes a mystery that plays constantly in the back of your mind during the film. Who was the man he took with him when escaped? Where is he now? It engages you and puts your mind into the proper framework. Tom Cruise is later written off along with the IMF and must operate rouge to save the US from terrorist named Hendricks who has the Russian launch codes and plans to use them against the US. Cruise's team are the guys that just happened to be with him at the moment...with no masks!  Great Stuff.<br /><br />This is a good old fashion break out the tub of popcorn and enjoy the feature action-comedy-thriller. I didn't see it in IMAX, but clearly that is the way to go considering how the scenes were shot. After seeing it once, I want to see it again on the really big screen.  And of course every \\"impossible\\" scene is made more complex, complicated, or twisted. Humorous and heart stopping action all in the same moment. Can you say Oscar?<br /><br />Good Luck.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

C'mon! And those special features are the best! I hope Disney will not apply this on future Diamond Editions. Despite this, everything is good.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|A few years ago, I bought the original Puzzle Quest for about $15 on XBL. It was more than worth it. I got several dozens of hours of pure addiction, and the game's quality far succeeded most retail games. Unfourtunately, I never got PQ2, although I did get Galactrix. When I saw this for just three bucks on the Amazon Android market, I couldn't believe my eyes. The sequel definitely lives up to the first game's appeal. Worth $3? Definitely. I would happily pay tenfold that amount.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This anniversary celebration of Les Miserables is simply wonderful.  If you have loved this musical for years, you will tremendously enjoy this DVD. I think it would also be a great first experience with it.  Alfie Boe has a voice that is pure velvet.  And seeing all the casts from over the years together was wonderful. We have the ten year celebration VHS version and did not think it could get any better but it does.  If you love a story of redemption, courage, and love, nothing beats Les Mis.  And these gorgeous voices!  Just have to say WOW!  Could you be disappointed (I'm not sure how).  And the rendition of Bring Him Home with all three tenors is surely heart stopping.  this is one that you will watch repeatedly.  I wish I had more knowledge of music to make this review more meaningful.  Let me just that this is wonderful (from the perspective of one who has seen Les Mis performed probably 10 times on stage).

B0056BMK6K|5.0|What John Locke establishes in this book is that he accomplished what the aspiring writers who bought the book are seeking, and they don't have to reinvent the wheel to do the same thing. He doesn't brag about it, he just states facts. His financial success with numbers. Sales. Why charging 99 cents for a book makes sense, how the big publishing houses are now stuck trying to justify charging 10x as much for their authors' ebooks. It really has pissed some people off, which is why the negative reviews of Locke's phenomenal success story.<br /><br />Locke is a pioneer and deserves praise from those of us who aspire to do the same thing.<br /><br />Really, I don't have much tolerance for hoity toity writers who've been in the business for over 40+ years and who resent Locke's success. Get over it, people. It's a new age - a new dawn. Get with the program! Remember the big problem in the recording industry and NAPSTER? This is the same thing - only instead of musicians it's writers. I welcome the ebook phenomenon because the publishing industry has been completely locked up for many years, and a lot of great talent never stood a chance.<br /><br />Locke talks about how he, like a lot of writers out there, was not published, was not a 'name', and his past careers weren't literary. He spells out where he came from and how he got to where he is today, and explains the ebook phenomenon and why and how it opened the door for all writers. Those are all points well taken.<br /><br />He offers a detailed 28-point checklist. He gives you a roadmap for the destination so it doesn't seem like pie-in-the-sky pipe dreams. It's great to let a pin fall on a map, and declare it's where you want to go - but it's a different thing altogether taking the journey. The 'how do I get there?' problem is solved here. He lays it out for you. He gives you a checklist, then explains each point.<br /><br />This book showed me that it's possible for a no-name writer like me to achieve great things and become a best-selling author with some degree of financial success. We don't need no stinkin' permission to become writers...we ARE WRITERS, and the stigma that used to go with self-publishing is fading. He showed me that he did it, and challenges the aspiring authors reading to take him up on the challenge of following his system.<br /><br />He points out that most writers don't have a plan. They write the book and throw it on the wall like spaghetti to see if it sticks. There really should be more thought that goes into it, and he goes into what it is you need to figure out before you even start writing! GOING IN WITH A PLAN! Now there's a concept.<br /><br />The beauty of the system he presents is - it has nothing to do with publishers or paying a publicist. It's all Do-IT-Yourself, utilizing blogs, social media and more. ANYBODY can do this, but it requires work, and due diligence of course, and a certain amount of organization skills. And chutzpah. After a point, though, you could have a team of people helping out because you could afford to hire them!<br /><br />I wonder if the previous reviewer even read it. I pored through each page, and read some pages over and over again. His style of writing is fresh, entertaining, and he doesn't talk down to the reader, even though he's obviously very successful.<br /><br />The descriptions of some of the characters in his books were such a kick, that I actually bought a Donovan Creed Kindle ebook book, and loved it. I have a friend who is a Green Beret who is very similar to the Creed character in every way, so I enjoyed it immensely and plan on getting more.<br /><br />So not only do I consider Locke an expert worth reading on the topic of how to become a successful writer, I am also a new fan. Thanks to Locke for taking the time and making the effort to prepare such a wonderful resource for aspiring writers. It inspired me to get off my duff, and I will continue to refer to it as I continue my own writer's journey.
B005LAIGGY|4.0|Adapted from the 2005 novel by Jonathan S. Foer, this is a brilliant film that certainly has Academy Award potential.  The acting is exceptional, the theme a haunting one and even though there are some parts of the plot that do not ring true, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and it left me deeply moved, sad and crying at the end.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is cast as a father who is deeply committed to his 9-year old son.  The son, brilliantly played by young Thomas Horn, who may or may not have Asperger's Syndrome, is extremely intelligent although afraid of such things as going on a swing in the park.  His father spends a lot of time with the boy and is committed to educating him.  The boy thrives on this.  And then, suddenly, the date is September 11, 2001 and the father is at a meeting on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center and makes several panicky calls home which get recorded on voice mail.  Sandra Bullock plays the mother in a heart rendering role.  She and her son have never been close and the boy resents her even though she deeply loves him and does her best to get him through the hard time he is having.<br /><br />One day the boy finds a key in his father's closet.  It is in a small brown envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it.  The boy assumes that this must be a person with the last name of Black and then sets out on a voyage of discovery to visit every single one of the 472 people in New York City with the last name of Black.  Soon he is joined by an old man in his eighties, played by Max Von Sydow who doesn't speak and who communicates through writing on a notepad..  Together they travel the city and there are a few humorous and heartfelt moments between them.  Eventually the boy does discover the truth about the key although it is not what he expected.<br /><br />There were a few problems with this film in general.  How can such a young boy be permitted to travel around the city alone? Where was the mother?  Eventually, in an emotional conclusion demonstrating fine acting by Sandra Bullock, we do find out but it's hard to believe that the plot could have really happened this way.<br /><br />Clearly, this is the saddest film I have ever seen and I will long remember it with tears in my eyes.  That is why I just stop short of giving it my highest recommendation. I do not want to recommend it only because I know it will make everyone who sees this film sad too.  And there surely is enough sadness in this world already.e acting by Sandra Bullock, we do find out but it's hard to believe that the plot could have really happened this way.

1451627289|4.0|Though it drags in spots, \\"11/22/63\\" is one of Mr. King's best. He's obviously taken up dancing as a hobby (therapy?) as it figures heavily in the tale. As to preventing Mr. Kennedy's assasination? Good idea? Leave well enough alone? To quote Mr. King himself from \\"Pet Semetary\\", hilariously mouthed by Fred (Herman Munster) Gwinne in the really bad film version: \\"Sometimes dead is better.\\" One of his best, it drew tears at the end. You rock, Steve-O!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Do you have to like Woody Allen movies to love Midnight in Paris?  Yes, otherwise the subtle nuance of sight, sound and dialog will be lost.  However, if you appreicate Mr. Allen's work like a sommelier knows the subtle differences between Merlot and Meritage this is a movie for you.<br /><br />I have not seen a movie in a long time that is both as enjoyable and literally stunning as this film.  Frame by frame; Mr. Allen paints a portrait of today's Paris bathed in rain, sunsets and street lights.  I have been to Paris and never saw the city with the beauty that Mr. Allen filmed it, but he makes me want to take the next Air France flight from Miami.<br /><br />Owen Wilson has always been one of my favorite actors.  Somehow, he channels Woody Allen without losing Owen Wilson.  It is a brilliant performance that I think is Oscar worthy.<br /><br />The music, wardrobe, lighting and editing are breathtaking.  I suggest you buy the film as you will want to see it over and over again.<br /><br />Congratulations to Mr. Allen for making the year's best picture.  As the author of [[ASIN:1452075158 Sara Rose, Kid Lawyer]] I would be humbles if Mr. Allen would consider taking it to the big screen.  I can think of no better director making films today.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This product is amazing!!! My daughters and my son love it.they see it over and over again and they also see the behind the scenes!! This product has very good quality ! We all love it!!!
0470474874|1.0|I purchased this for my son, who is a Mac user, and the enclosed CDs do not work for a Mac, so we decided to return it. The product description does not let you know this upfront. Excel has always worked for a Mac (one of the reasons Bill Gates is a billionaire). The book is fairly expensive and part of the cost is the CD. It seems it would be fairly easy for the author to have a Mac programmer convert the CDs to a Mac or at least offer the book at a smaller cost without the CD.

B000002KBD|5.0|It bothers me that so many \\"professional\\" music historians and critics reluctantly praise this album and opine that it falls short of the genius of Van's previous two albums \\"Astral Weeks\\" and \\"Moondance\\". I heartily disagree with those shortsighted reviews of \\"His Band & The Street Choir\\". While this album may have been a stylistic departure from the previous two LP's, it was just Van stretching his wings and exercising his true musical genius. This is Van's first great homage to American soul and R&B, and what a fantastic, funky, and deeply soulful homage it is. Kicking off with the lively superhit \\"Domino\\" we know we're in for a treat and one can sense Van's excitement as he soulfully belts out the lyrics over a very Memphis Horns-influenced funk band backing. The second track, Crazy Face, is a melodious soul ballad that would've done Otis Redding proud. Beautiful sax solo and gospel-tinged organ behind Van's wailing vocals. Then the masterfully funky and infectious \\"I've Been Working\\" that I dare any ass to stay in its seat while listening to. This is a groove-packed soul classic. Other songs on the album \\"Blue Money\\", \\"Gypsy Queen\\", \\"If I Ever Needed Someone\\" and \\"Street Choir\\" attest to the all-too-clear truth that this masterpiece is not a second fiddle to Van's previous albums. This album stands alone and deserves just as many stars as those albums do. Personally, I've never been overly impressed with Astral Weeks, I just never really dug it all that much. Moondance is an incredible and great album, but Street Choir is quite possibly my favorite Van Morrison album of them all. It's a celebration of life, of love, and of music. It is spiritual on many levels. I LOVE THIS ALBUM! Thank you Van.

B00004TS0E|2.0|This 1994 version of Miracle on 34th street, starring falls very short of the original in many ways. I am sorry to say that this VIDEO and its characters lacked the luster of the 1934 award winning performance by British actor Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, Gene Lockhart and the warmth and charm of Natalie Wood.<br />  The story has a few small changes and the \\"magic things\\" Santa did are weak and missing. The little girl. Mara Wilson, does pretty good but lacks the luster, depth and brilliance of young Natalie Wood and over all the story seems flat,  lacking the loving charm of the main characters in the 1934 version, and actually somewhat boring.<br />  THAT BEING SAID; You must watch and buy the three versions of this story on the Special Edition of the 1934 original version that Amazon offers.  It contains all three original versions. The B&W, the colorized and a miracle find of the 1950 64 minute TV version. In the 2 disk set FOX also included the feature length audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara. THIS IS A SURE FIRE COLLECTOR VERSION.  I have the original version but this one I had to buy and keep and share only with a few good friends so it would not be damaged.
1612680003|5.0|Everyone should read this book, especially if you have children. It really makes you change the way that you view and use your money. The advise isn't what you want to hear, but what you need to hear...you just have to listen and put it into effect.

The authors are entertaining, the book is NOT boring!  Loved it!!

B004O3YGMC|1.0|This app set up perfect on my gtablet and worked really nice from my wireless network. Then I decided to try it from a wireless network outside the home. couldnt connect. Created gmail account, turned on network discovery, entered credentials, still couldnt find my computer. What's the use if you can only use it on your own network? Might as well just go to the computer!
B004GYY714|3.0|Really like this app, and the ability to quickly find a program by genre.  For example I can look for \\"talk radio\\", \\"business\\" shows, and then get a list of all currently playing shows all over the country and find them.  Recently though, it looks like they now feature \\"stations\\" over specific programs in the search results.  It's easier to pick a show by the title of the show.<br /><br />Some software revision is needed, because when driving down the interstate it frequently pauses and drops the data stream, requiring frequent clicking and punching.  If you're listening to a podcast, it usually restarts it from the beginning, which is frustrating, if you've listened to half of it already and have to annoyingly fiddle with it to get to the last point listened.<br /><br />For comparison, IheartRadio app rarely drops audio stream, even with the same stretch of highway which I travel every week.  IheartRadio also starts the audio within 2 seconds, while TuneIn takes 5-20 seconds to start the audio.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|If you think good horror is supposed to be like Friday the 13'th or Saw or Wolf Creek or various other gory / torture-porn movies, then this is not the movie for you.  If on the other hand you like complex plots that are challenging and suspenseful, if you like witnessing a character change in the face of hellish adversity and trying to escape from an awful plight, if you like a movie that makes you THINK, then this is the movie for you.  People who liked The Shining or Memento will like this film.  When I first rented it, I wasn't planning on paying it much attention.  I figured it would be another cheesey Bermuda Triangle film.  I am SO delighted to report that this movie has nothing to do with the Bermuda Triangle.<br /><br />Instead it is a film with far reaching roots, going back to Greek mythology, and, like Memento, as time passes you see events from different perspectives that suddenly change the context of what you saw earlier in ways that will surprise you.  Ultimately the decisions of the main character become clear, and the ending does this with dark power.<br /><br />If you are willing to sit and pay attention to this movie, to immerse yourself in it, you will enjoy it.  I recommend it heartily... this is one that you will find your mind returning to long after the film is over.
0515123447|5.0|Just started to read the series.  It was a good read.  The author loved using the word \\"suck\\" or \\"sucked\\" for the description of a door opening and shutting.  Other than that I really liked the book.

B003ZMF26W|5.0|So at this point I've had the mouse for eight months, and it continues to serve me as well as it did back in April when I ordered/received it. I also take good care of it, so I'm sure that's another reason why it's lasted so far. I know selecting a gaming mouse can be hard and especially obscure products such as this one that do not have a immense amount of reviews can also be a turn-off. Well let me just say that this mouse is everything I hoped for and more.<br /><br />The mouse I replaced was the Logitech MX518, highly regarded as one of the best gaming mice around, and it really is/was a great mouse. But alas I felt I needed to replace it, I just got tired of using the same mouse for so long and I'm glad I moved on. I gave the MX518 to my girlfriend and she is still enjoying it so it still has a happy life, but if you ever used the MX518 and thought it was comfortable, then the Inferno will be an easy transition because it's one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used. Honestly to see any review about this mouse being uncomfortable is baffling, they must have giant-sized hands or something. (What's funny is the MX518 is actually more money than this one, shows what popularity can do)<br /><br />This mouse has so many options it may be hard to understand at first. If you are great with macros then it shouldn't be too hard for you, but if you're someone who rarely has a use or just never made macros before, it can be daunting. I recommend looking up tutorials to learn how to make them. Don't blame the software because you're not too adept in macro-creations. I'm not too adept myself but know the basics enough to make macros if I need them for anything.<br /><br />Quick mention, it does only have red LEDs on the mouse but you can set it to different modes. Also, the mouse wire is awesome and I love the strength it has to it. This wire will not rip unless you intentionally want to rip it, I do not understand the complaints on the wire at all.<br /><br />Now if you're a gamer and see 4000 DPI, you might be inclined to go to a 5600 DPI mouse, all I can say is DON'T BASE YOUR DECISIONS ON DPI AMOUNT! I don't even use the highest DPI settings because I just have no need, it's as smooth as I need it to be and I game a LOT!<br /><br />Let me also mention real quick that a friend of mine had the Cyborg R.A.T. 9, a mouse that is three times the cost of this one and he had issues from the get-go with it, eventually having to send it back about a month ago because it crapped out on him. Do not base your mice decisions on price alone because you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Some people also know about the Twin-Laser issue that other mice have had. It's a certain brand of laser technology that when you lift the mouse up and place it back on a surface, the cursor will jolt slightly. This does have that same issue but I have never noticed it affect my gameplay experience at all, and I play FPS, MMOs, MOBAs (League of Legends), RPGs and more and never once did I stop and say, \\"Wow, that laser technology issue really messed me up there!\\" In fact, before writing this review, I kinda forgot about it. The only time will you notice this issue is when you purposely do it and have a mouse cursor showing. It's extremely minor and will not affect you in any way.<br /><br />Last but not least I would like to say you should have this mouse on a completely flat surface. For the past eight months I have been using a wooden desk as the surface for it because normal mouse pads DO NOT WORK with it; when I say this, I mean the cursor will not be smooth and will be very messed up spinning everywhere, the laser is just too sensitive for surfaces such as that. I recently ordered the Razer Goliathus mousepad and assume it will work very nicely with this baby. If it does I will mention so.<br /><br />In conclusion and TL;DR for some people, get this mouse, it's amazing and the only gaming/casual mouse you'll ever need. The minor issues it has are nothing and will never affect your gaming/casual lifestyles.

B004A8ZWXS|3.0|A random walk through World War I. By a horse.   Made in Classic Hollywood style, the film is populated by good actors, beautiful (or beautifully horrible) sets, and a grand vision. While the individual segments are fine, they do not come together to create a whole which is greater than the parts. In fact the whole may be less than the sum of its parts, diminished by mawkishly transparent manipulation of the audience.   Spielberg is a master manipulator but here the hand of the master is a bit heavy.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|As I expected with Brad Bird directing, MI:GP is well and carefully constructed. It's fast paced but unrushed. The characters are distinct; their interactions fun and credible. The action is intense, the stakes are high, and the whole thing is leavened with a good amount of humor. And some of the stuff Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt suffers caused me to wince and cringe in sympathetic pain.  I'd quibble in a couple of places: not a fan of the title sequence that basically previews the movie, and Ethan Hunt falls off of things just one too many times prompting my daughter and I both to laugh where that was obviously not the intended response. Still, a respectable action flick and an interesting addition to animation director Brad Bird's resume.
B0061S073A|5.0|Great app for my Kindle Fire. It allows me to let my six year old use the fire supervised without fear of him being able to make purchases by accident, since one touch ordering cannot be actually turned off (just makes me mad). This is a great app for anyone with kids!

B004EC5IV6|2.0|\\"I will start of by saying I did watch the orginal series.  I have seen this over and over again I was attempting to figure out what the hype was all about and Well in my Opnion (IMO) They should not have \\"Remade\\" This series.  The orginal you have to take alot in it had some great action and awesome grapgics for its time, The orginal story jumped around alot and it seemed that the ending was done to quickly, the orginal did not take \\"IMO\\" enough time to explain the main Charaters and made them either realy Winny, Exstreamly tempermental or Emotionaly blank...The orginal I would of given 3 perhaps 4 stars b/c even with some of the flaws you still had a awesome Scf-fi anime but in all that was the Orginal series.  However this is a remake of the orginal series and I do see that they cut alot out to add some eye candy to this generation of Anime viewers. Personaly I think they did a poor job of it and should not of messed with something that had flaws to begin with.  But on a side note it's still a Sci-fi anime with loads of action but b/c of the cuts and the trimming they made I do think they made it much much worse.\\" Is what I posted on 1.11 and found it also relevent here.  They did a little better job on this one then 1.11 it seems they kept more of the story with this one but I still give it two stars b/c they should not of remade the series like this.

The younger child, a boy, is hidden in a closet by his sister, who carries the key with her. That is the key of the title. Without giving away what happens, all I can say is the first half of the movie is well made and emotionally stirring -- it's a Holocaust story and the movie has a great cast. Unfortunately, the main character, a journalist, is less and less believable and likable as the movie progresses. There are some completely unnecessary scenes in which she is looking for lost family members but not finding them -- why are we looking at perfect strangers opening their doors and shaking their heads? Couldn't the director think of anything else to fill out the story with? It goes downhill from there -- the last third of the movie is poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted. It's tempting to give it a high rating because of the power of the subject matter, many Jewish families were destroyed by the Nazis and some children were rescued by brave, kind souls, but the movie doesn't live up to its promise.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I downloaded this for my kindle fire and it works perfectly. The game is very addicting. It adds some very fun twists to the classic Uno game.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|There were a lot of reviews that were chilly towards this movie. I read one that even though it was some kind of spoof. It's not. It's basically a sub genre of science fiction called the weird western. They've neen around forever. This one has tons of great explosions and a mysterious arm band ray gun and lots of action. I don't know what more people want. This is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in years. Watch it. Just watch it.
B004KO8036|5.0|Red Fang are one dangerous outfit.  I don't have their debut as of this writing but I will be ordering it shortly based on the power of \\"Murder The Mountains\\".  Fans of High On Fire and Yob, take note.  This Portland foursome all have lengthy pedigrees under their belts in separate outfits, but they have hit the right chemistry as Red Fang, one of the heaviest rock and roll bands out there.  Note I said \\"rock and roll\\".  Metalheads will love it, too, and I'm one, but these guys know how to write songs that go somewhere and have actual classic pop structures like the great heavyweights of yore, like Nazareth, Mountain, or Budgie.  Plus, there are actual real sung vocals, not generic growling or shrieking, and best of all, no blast beats!!  Yay!<br />  This album may have a somewhat weird title - how does one murder a mountain, unless you're Zeus?  Red Fang just might be able to bring one down with their crushing attack, if anybody can.  Tracks like \\"Hank Is Dead\\" almost explode in intensity, the guitars sounding like a demolition derby from Hell, yet retaining a real melodic sense.  That isn't easy to do, at least in this day and age.<br />  Red Fang will be a huge act and only the bravest and heaviest brethren are advised to share a stage with this outfit.  Unless I were Electric Wizard, High on Fire or Yob, I'd think twice about letting these guys open my show.  They are dangerous competition and the fans are the winners.  Some of the heaviest and best written heavy rock and roll to come down the pike in a long, long time.
B00005JLCI|2.0|This is an Elizabethan play with Elizabethan language. But the costuming in this movie is not of that period. That spoiled it for me. Changing the time the play is supposed to be in doesn't add anything to it.
067144901X|5.0|My Daughter is 13 months and we read this all the time! She loves the pictures and thinks its so funny when I say the pig says \\"la la la\\" haha! When we read our bedtime story this is a book she never fails to get.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|As indicated by the subtitle \\"The Kingkiller Chronicles: Day Two\\", The Wise Man's Fear picks up where The Name of the Wind left off, continuing into the second day of the telling of Kvothe's tale. The Name of the Wind was what I consider a perfect epic fantasy, combining the timeless quality of a fairy tale with the believability of a legend gone to myth. Patrick Rothfuss' writing is dramatic without being overly so, his prose is beautiful, and his language feels archaic while still remaining easily understood. There is no denying he's a natural-born storyteller.   That said. For as long as fans waited, I expected better.  To start with, I had every intention of re-reading The Name of the Wind beforehand, but ended up just jumping into The Wise Man's Fear when the mood struck. I spent the first several chapters regretting that decision. It had been so long since I read the first book that it was hard to rekindle the enthusiasm and I'd forgotten enough to be a little lost. The story's progress has slowed to a snail-like pace. If a third of this book was removed, it would've been better for it. Countless pages are spent on mundane and repetitious threads, while more exciting events are summarized in just a few sentences. When I finally got to the end, I was relieved that I hadn't spent any more time with this tale. (It took me more days to finish this book than anything I've ever read before.)  Rothfuss still proves to be very good at making key elements relatable to his audience. Much of Kvothe's story continues to center on the University. His academic endeavors, as well as his social experiences, resemble real college life. Kvothe is a very talented musician, and his music is another relatable aspect of the novel. If you're an artist, or even if you're just a no-talent aficionado like me, you can relate to the way Kvothe's music is a big part of who he is. As for this reader, I enjoy spending time in a nice, cozy bar, so naturally I enjoyed the Waystone Inn interludes the best.   However, I had difficulty accepting that Kvothe could be only sixteen or seventeen years old during these adventures. Admittedly, I'm a hard sell when it comes to child characters. Some authors have made me believe that a kid can fit an adult's worth of life experience into so few years -- Mark Lawrence's The Prince of Thorns, for example -- but only a very few, and this time, Rothfuss didn't quite pull it off.   It's because Rothfuss set the bar so high with The Name of the Wind that a three-star rating seems bad by comparison. To give credit where it's due, there are some moments of exceptionally gifted writing in The Wise Man's Fear. Nonetheless, when I look back at my reading experience, what I recall most is boredom.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|it took a while to load but it was an awesome game it was so intriguing I hope you enjoy.
B006IGZWB2|2.0|This book was prob' great but the movie version, hmmm not so much, I can't quite put my finger on why.  It felt like they struggled to portray the era, over acted (particularly the white women), costuming over done fake.<br />It felt disjointed and hard to get attatched too.<br />Id recc'd : \\" The long walk home\\" with Spacek and Goldberg instead, its superb.  There are others too that are better, I watch this subject matter frequently and this just didnt take me in as they usually do. the characters fall flat and or the acting is sub par (again white womens parts). In my opinion the running time was just too long, sorta made the story fall flat. I kept fighting the urge to speed ahead, but I paid for this and I kept thinking it had to get better.<br />As for amazon video rental I rented this on holiday wknd (off peak hrs) special for 2 bucks, the quality was not what I would expect and would call poor.<br />I have a fast cable connection and pc and am very familiar with optimizing all settings for video and do well with most streaming I run frequently but this was a bit flashy, choppy and grainy in scenes.<br />Im glad I didnt rent a thriller or action flick.<br />It was fine for this type of film but I will be very careful how much I pay and what I choose next time.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is one of the most beautifully rendered works I have ever laid eyes upon. Rothfuss' incredible sense of humor and ability to see elusive elements of human emotion are evident in his masterful character creation. Well worth the read if you are a fan of Tolkien, Eddings, Brooks, or Jordan. Enjoy!

0553801473|1.0|I have read the whole series so far, so I wanted to get this book.  Looking at the $35 price tag at the bookstore was a little hard so I finally went to the library and borrowed it.  I am glad I did.  To be honest, I found this series predictable but entertaining.  I could pretty much figure out what was going to happen to who well before I read it.  A Dance with Dragons just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and leaves me asking the question what exactly was he thinking when he wrote this book?  I am no author but I could have done a better job.  This book isn't even boring filler material needed to set up back stories or to move the book along.  What he does to some of the characters leaves more questions than answers.  Really, what was the purpose of Jon in the series if he is killed off?  What is Bran doing with the greenseers?  What is Arya's purpose?  Why did Daenyris fight for the slaves if she is just going to run off and let them be enslaved again?  With this tome, the author has utterly destroyed the whole purpose of this series.  He has killed off most of the important characters and left the others with absolutely no direction at all so that this series is spiraling downward into a pit from which it will take a massive undertaking to recover to even be an acceptable series in the genre.  This book was a severe disappointment for me and was not even worth borrowing from the library.  I definitely won't be waiting anxiously for the next book after this disaster.  Maybe Goodkind or Williams will have a new series coming out soon.  Heck, I'll even take a new Dragonlance over this series now.

I believe I have found that solution in this Pelican PS3 triggers.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has tons of fun and unique games. they make you work hard. not very good on kindle compared to ipod touch.
B004KKX80A|5.0|Between my meteo l drago and basalt big bang is my favorite he is extreemily powerful and so unpredictable my favorite part is when my opponent thinks they are winning and then big bang unleashes hell when he goes into attack mode! He is also very wide, before in battles i used to get real close to the stadium to see everything, but big bang likes to knock beys out of arenas so i wouldn't reccomend getting to close to a stadium. I hope to buy hell kerbecs next so i can have two ultimate beys because big bang is strong but if he cant kill his opponent quick enough then they will keep spinning bc his stamina is not to great, but the attack makes up for it. ive also dropped him a couple of times but it doesnt seem like hes messed up and he doesn't have any paint but metal so you dont have to worry about a bad paint job after a few battles. Word to the wise though when you first open the bey make sure you really tighten it bc i was so excited to have him i just began battling and he fell apart in the arena T.T so embarrassing!
B004RFYEEC|5.0|An excellent product.  Beautifully packaged with everything a true Beach Boys fan would wish for. Vinyl is superb..  Well worth the money!  Great service from Amazon.  Thank you.
B005PTQPU0|2.0|An avid fan, I must register disappointment.  The work on this  album is more like tone poems than songs.  Considering the   long wait between new original material, all I can say is that  she is exploring uncharted new areas or is creatively bankrupt.  A clue is the length of most of the cuts - overlong and  numbingly repetitive.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fruit Ninja is a fun game!! I love how there are 3 types of games on this one game for only $0.99!! if you get this game you won't be sorry!!
B000X418UO|5.0|It seemed a bit far fetched, but with the prison system the way it is throughout the country it could be possible. At least for this movie it had a great ending, the kid wasn't killed by the psycho nor did the worst of the worst get away from Cage's justice, especially the leader who plays bad guys to perfection. All in all it held my attention throughout the show. I'd recommended it to everyone.
B005HSL626|3.0|Its really fun at first, and can be for a long time if u get hooked. But for a price of 0 nobody can be picky. If ur.looking for more fun games, checkout paper toss.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this a great game with great color. I love playing it! its simple touch is great too. you don't have to drag each card.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|Achtung Baby is an outstanding piece of work, in my opinion probably U2's best work. I really like the second disc, in particular the \\"Mysterious Ways\\" track (No. 9). It simply blows my mind. If you like U2, pick up the deluxe edition of Achtung Baby. You'll be very pleased.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have seen all the film on Jane Austin's \\"Emma\\" that I can get my hands on and this is far the best.  Romala Garai's acting is wonderful. The sets are superb.  My favorite scene is when Emma dances with Knightly at the ball.  For anyone who loves Jane Austin, this is a must.

B003UYUR0G|5.0|For some the Prince Of Persia wasn't all that good. But for others like myself it was excellent. I saw nothing lacking in the storyline, nor in most of the actors. Good triumphs over evil. The special effects were outstanding. I enjoyed the whole of the show, but then again I've liked most of the movies based on distant times in Persia, the swords and sandal movies they're called. If you're like me give it a try, but find the best price, either DVD or Blu-ray which ever is less expensive. You've nothing to lose.
B0038P80CO|5.0|This film was a surprise, and a good one at that - I don't typically like horro-scifi but this was tasteful, engaging, plot-driven, and stimulating (particularly the ending).
B0063IH60K|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys playing solitaire.  Graphics are really exceptional.  I enjoyed. playing this game quite a lot
B005N95JA4|5.0|The deluxe edition of Some Girls is outstanding, definitley one of the Stones' best. Pick it up as soon as possible!!!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album is perfect. I have listened to it more times all the way through, without skipping any tracks, than most CDs I've owned for ages.  It's the perfect driving CD. I love listening to it when I drive by myself, because I can sing along ridiculously with my fake British accent. But it's also great for driving with other people, because it serves as perfect background music for any conversation - and most people end up loving Mumford & Sons by the end of the ride. (of course, I don't sing when they're there. that would change things.)  It's also the perfect creative CD: I like to listen to it while I sew. The stories their songs evoke make me want to paint... but alas, I am not a painter. They sing with such feeling.  I (age 22) love this album, my friends love it, my boyfriend loves it, my little brother loves it, my mom loves it. They're great.
B005ORVMT2|4.0|This is a response to Noah Rice's post regarding the All the Worlds a Stage disc.  I too have the same problem, from track 7 onward it is all glitchy and unplayable.  I tried to rip the audio to my hard drive with Exact Audio Copy and I get Sync Errors and Suspicious Position messages - this is definitely a manufacturing flaw and not an isolated incident.  However, the band is only (so far acknowledging flaws in the Fly by Night cd and A Farewell to Kings DVD audio so we are on our own with this one, looks like I will have no choice but to exchange the whole box with Amazon and hope for the best.  I did manage to get an email address for SRO/Anthem and emailed them to let them know there is yet another issue with this set  :-(  On the bright side, I love the way these remasters sound.  Yes, they are loud, but dynamics are preserved and they have a great punchy sound with deep bass.  JQ
B003U2QHB6|2.0|Whole family loved the first when viewed in 2011, it is aging well.  This one is not aging well too many things are too bogus to keep the story line going.  The scene with the Reaper's Challenge is the only redeeming scene and even that one is slower than most scenes in today's comedies.  Only watch if you are a \\"Bill and Ted\\" Historian.
1451627289|4.0|I am not one into history and I am ashamed to say that I never thought \\"that stuff\\" was important in school and it is only now as I am getting older that I am learning that \\"that stuff\\" is actually pretty interesting and I wished I would have at least paid attention to it in school and learned something. So when I saw this book by Stephen King, one of my favorite authors I thought \\"oh great, I am going to be getting a history lesson told by one of the great masters of writing\\". I was so excited to get my hands on this book. I was a bit nervous as I didn't know much about the events leading up to the shooting of JFK but the storyline of the book was nice and smooth and it gently led me up to the date in 1963 when the motorcade came cruising down the street.  I remember reading King when he wrote the books that had me lying awake at night being creeped out or worrying about demented things but this book put me in a different state of mind.  Lately after reading a few of Kings books, I find myself reflecting on life or myself and this book is no different.  11/22/63 whole premise is time-travel and who wouldn't like to time-travel whether that be forward or backward in time.  Who wouldn't like a \\"do-over\\" just once or twice when life gives them a wrong hand or you made a wrong decision? Sounds good to me for I would like to have my life be good at least for a while when it's not but have you thought how it could affect anyone else's life? Do you even care about that? Hmmmm. Jake in this novel takes over the mission to prevent JFK's assassination and he doesn't realize how big of a task this is.  You can't just plop in from 2011 to 1963 without some conseqences and Jake is the kind of a man with a conscience.  How King keeps my attention going for 842 pages is beyond me but the story is engaging and I got some history too - a bonus package. The ending was not what I expected, I expected more drama, more hype, more something but perhaps King is changing his style or perhaps it is me. You be the judge.<br /><br />\\"The multiple choices and possiblities of daily life are the music we dance to. They are like the strings on a guitar. Strum them and you create a pleasing sound.

0307277887|5.0|The first book in an excellent series that some, such as myself, will LOVE, while other will hate. But what are you going to do, haters gonna hate, right? Dexter is a blood spatter analyst by day, a serial killer by night. Basically, he's the Hannah Montanna of serial killers. (I appologize for an awful comparison, but maybe you get the point?) I love reading about Dex because he has a sense of humor, even if he is a cold, lifeless amobea inside. Emotionally, Dex is a dead battery, but he sure does make me laugh, which is strange considering this a novel written from a serial killer's point of view. But Dex is often hilarious.<br /><br />The book is also thrilling and heartpounding in places, especially near the end. Along with Dex, there is an interesting set of characters, including Dex's foul mouthed sister, Debs, the mind-in the gutter, Vince Masuka, and La Guerta, whose gunning for world's worst boss of the year award. Dex, of course, is the reason I read these books, and I find it interesting that the book's in the perspective of a serial killer. Even without emotions, he still makes me care about him, and keeps me interested in the story. How does he do it?<br />Darkly Dreaming Dexter also has some of the best scenes between Dexter and his father, Harry. Here, we get to learn the dark origins of the likable serial killer, and about his early life. What events, you wonder, shaped that strange, dark, ball of clay into the prowling killer that is Dexter Morgan?<br /><br />I love Dexter, and I love the first book in the series. Well worth it.
B002MXA7TC|3.0|I love the feeling that Sweet Disposition evokes - I can listen to that song multiple times in a row, and it just fills me with joy and a sense of wonder. I was hoping that this CD would be an entire album of that feeling, and I could be lost for longer than that 4 minutes or so.  That may have been a silly presumption, but nevertheless this album did not meet my expectations. Sweet Disposition is still, by far, the best song on the CD, and there are only a few other songs on the album that I really enjoy listening to. I do think the Temper Trap makes interesting music, but I don't think I needed the entire album.
B004A8ZWXS|5.0|War Horse was powerful and timeless between man and horse in the wartime.  Beautiful and you get tears or two. Really like the hard not to wince but powerful scene of Joey who were tangled in painful barwires around got two soliders from two countries to cooperate for awhile to save Joey.  It's the best film of the year and deserves many awards including Oscars for Joey, War Horse and several actors and actresses.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This is such a good movie and all the discs in this pack make it a great value too. Its like E.T. meets the goonies.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|I suppose the title of my review alone will bring wrath down on me, but so be it.  I found this show in the middle of its second season.  Despite the amount of important material I had missed, I hung in there and kept following along, finally buying the DVDs of previous shows and catching up.  It has been well worth the effort.  \\"Fringe,\\" while seeming very much like a derivative of \\"The X-Files\\" as it geared up, really came to not only stand on its own, but outclass its predecessor already by the end of its first season.  (I say this as someone who owns most of the run of \\"The X-Files\\" on DVD.)  It really hit its stride in season two and shows no signs of faltering here in season three.  The (literally) multidimensional narrative, the complexity of the many strands that form that narrative, the performances across the board are all top-flight.  (The plot, by the way, is not confusing, despite its complexity.  You don't have to be Sheldon Cooper to enjoy it.  And even characters who often simply pop in and out, like Jasika Nicole and Blair Brown, are FABULOUS.)    It looks very much like Fox is on its way to kiling this outstanding show (why the banishment to Friday night last season?  Why?), which is a real shame, since I think it has legs to go longer than the X-Files did, certainly longer than \\"Lost.\\" But I fear we will be robbed of this exceedingly imaginative, entertaining, thought-provoking show well before its natural life would have given out.  I know that's the way of television, but it would be downright criminal in this case.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|We purchased this for our 8 year old grandson for Christmas.  The package arrived on time and in great condition.  We made sure this was the last present he opened because we knew boring clothes wouldn't even get a look once he had his new Nerf gun.  The gun is very well made and as it turns out, a lot of fun for the adults too!  It was \\"accidentally\\" shot at someone at close range (by an adult) and didn't hurt the person who got hit.  It's kind of big, but it comes apart and can be shot in two different lengths.  The shorter nozzle is the more accurate one.  Our grandson loved it.  His dad is a hunter and so could show our grandson the finer points of aiming through the sight, how to hold the gun while walking and general gun safety.  This was a great purchase and we are all glad he got it.

B006O5Y0SS|2.0|This movie is for 3 types of people. 1) Die-hard Woody Allen fans, 2) People who love Owen Wilson, and 3) Sci-fi and/or time travel aficionados. Everyone else ... save your money. It's not worth even 99¢.  I'm bothering to write a review to save people like me from tossing out any pennies on this stupid flick as well as removing any expectations you might have of a fun 2 hrs.  I like most of Woody Allen's films ... except for the too-far-out-for-me ones. Midnight in Paris definitely falls into that category. Owen has never done it for me, and the only time travel stuff I've fallen for is Kate & Leopold, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married, and The Lake House. You could fall into these movies, trip back in time with the cast and drop caringly into another century, forgetting ... for a while ... from whence you came.   If you want to suspend belief and watch Owen Wilson tiptoe thru time, acting his dumbstruck, dopey self, you'll love this flick. Personally, I'd have walked out of the theater in 20 minutes or less, but since it was online, I hung around waiting in vain for it to become likable. Never happened.   Hated it. My two-stars is only because if Woody did it, something brilliant this way must have come, even if I couldn't see it.  p.s. I am, however, a big fan of his brother, Luke Wilson.

B006INDGFE|1.0|We rented this movie to unwind after the long Christmas weekend. The writers, editors, filmaker, actors (and i use this term only as an adjective, for there are no actors in this movie)publisher and producers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this kind of sloppily finished product out for the public. Not only does it insult the average person's intelligence, it slams whats left of todays morals by their crude shock and awe language and images. Shame Shame Shame. It is pretty sad when one stoops this low to make a buck; at another's expense; giving nothing back, stealing what they can get. If I had read the reviews I would not have rented this trashed vulgar movie; the only good thing from it is the lesson i wont forget for a long long time, read the reviews before buying.

0385504225|2.0|After reading the Da Vinci Code I was really looking forward to hours of intrigue after having made this purchase. Unfortunately, whilst tediously working my way through (I will confess to have skipped a lot) some far too lengthy descriptions I found myself focussing on the authors unusual grammatical style rather than on the potentially good story.  In particular, the use of italics which could have been replaced with a higher level of writing skill and the many new paragraphs. Are these space fillers? Do readers feel that if they buy a thicker book that this justifies the investment? Whilst I don't have the answers, I feel a good story was spoiled by unnecessary padding.   Entertaining yes. There are better options out there however. Let's hope the writers next novel will be of a higher quality with perhaps some more disciplined editting and not merely be a free ride on the momentum of a previous success.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|This CPU makes for a great general purpose and gaming machine. As far as the stock cooler and fan, I found it to be more than adequate for me to over clock it to 4.5 Ghz. It kept case temps at 35 to 37 Celcius at idle and at abt. 68 cpu degrees at gaming, loaded at full bore DX11 and hi settings on several current games like Crysis 2 and Skyrim and the like. I guess it's important to have good air flow in the case. And not loud fans either. I have a total of three case fans one cpu fan and one psu fan. It overclocks very easy in the bios. As far as getting the I7 2600K over the I5 2500K I figure that the 2600 is more future proof, being that as time goes by more cores will be used. When it gets to where one needs more than four cores the extra threads will come into play. So when things get to where one needs six to eight cores this CPU will still perform and when higher speed cpu's are needed it will overclock to over five GHZ, and then better cooling can then be employed. So as I see it this CPU has a long life.
0553378384|5.0|I have been studying astrology for the past 45 years under two master astrologers with input from several accomplished astrologers. This book is very beneficial and an important reference book for me. For those using astrology as a tool to self awareness and personal growth, I belive this book is an essential read and will be a continual treasured reference.
B004VF68AQ|3.0|Jane's Addiction is a huge part of my personal history. Just thinking about \\"Mountain Song\\" provokes a powerful, primal response in me. So, I was excited to see Jane's had a new endeavor, and that my awesome brother bought it for me. Listening to it, however, has thrown me for a loop.   I don't consider myself a purist, by any means. Bands grow and evolve, if they are passionate enough about music, and I think some \\"fans\\" resent growth, are so attached to the earlier, younger musician and their product, that they cannot accept that 40 year olds make different music than 20 year olds.  That being said, this album is underwhelming.  The lyrics are pedestrian. Lost is the epic grandeur of my beloved \\"Mountain Song.\\" Gone is the creative quirkiness of \\"Standing in the Shower Thinking.\\" Perkins' drums, Navarro's guitar, and often times, in my opinion, Perry's unique and driving vocals are just lost in an ocean of electronics.  Nothing on this CD makes the body want to move, and that is probably due to the lack of some truly inspired Avery bass.  This all makes me sad.  I don't recommend this album for old Jane's fans hoping for something great. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone who has never heard Jane's. I don't hate it, but I am as far away from loving it as that allows.
B005HSL626|4.0|fun and colorful, this game is great! there are different types of game modes. even though it's the free version, it's still great. the graphics are nice too. the ads are annoying though.

B0034G4P94|2.0|Rocky this is not! I was disappointed with this movie. The acting was pretty good overall, and a movie centered around MMA was a great idea. However, the fight scenes were just OK, hardly comparable with the real thing, and some finishing moves left me thinking \\"really, he couldn't get out of that?\\". Overall hastily done choreographing with little passion or suspense to grab onto. The story itself is what really left me feeling cold. It was a nasty setup... brother hating brother, both brothers hating and disrespecting their father. Even Jesus Christ gets attacked while the brothers argue endlessly.  An AWOL \\"hero\\". Left me totally unable to identify with the characters. And the worst is, nothing gets resolved at the end. All the issues that are brought up in the movie are left dangling in the insipid wind. The movie ends with the last fight and that is that, no questions answered (like did the dead soldier's widow get to share the winnings after all?), no balm to soothe our wounded, aching souls. Sad!

B005CMSDKA|4.0|Saw the trailer and was excited with all the action, thus, prompted me to get the movie.  Overall the movie was very entertaining but felt that the story was bit awkward in the sense that all her known family and friends are dead, even her enemies, So that leaves me wondering, how will she carry on after the ending as she is still a kid and will need guidance - sorry but that my sense of how a film should not end - an open ended one that leaves it to your imagination, which I don't have much that's why I watch movies.  The action was good while it lasted and have this music ringing in my head (the one where the bad guy is whistling before the family interrogation).  Still questions remains, such as how the \\"father\\" expects her to know her target just by name and also the world around her, such as getting to Germany, let alone locating the Grimm house and her maternal grandmother's place.  For that matter, even searching the Internet.  There's my 2 cents into the pot.  Acting wise, Saoirse Ronan is pretty good at being Hanna, Eric Bana has a strange accent (German I presume) and Cate Blanchett with an American accent (not too sure from where - South?)
B000002L9J|5.0|Well, I'll tell you a few things that maybe have not been touched on.[...]<br /><br />The \\"Mr. Shankly\\" in \\"Frankly, Mr. Shankly\\" has to be referring to the famous Liverpool soccer (football in Britglish) club manager Bill Shankly who is most known for his quote: \\"Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.\\"<br /><br />Given the Smiths were Manchester United supporters, the song could be a dig at their main rivals, Liverpool, even though it is a bit obtuse.<br /><br />As far as the album, no point in me adding any more raves than you've read here before other than I'll say it's their most complete album from start to finish.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this.  It helps me during hard times!  When I have no Bible around me, this is what I use.  GET IT!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|This is the best Woody Allen movies since \\"Manhattan\\" and \\"Annie Hall\\".  However, I have one problem. Both the DVD and Blue Ray demonstrate  a yellow tint, especially at the beginning with his multiple views of Paris.  Am I the only one who appreciates (ugh!) this problem?
B001QXE0OC|5.0|It plays great, and since Selena Gomez is a favorite in our home, it never gets old.  It's good listening.
B001EN71DG|4.0|I got this box set knowing that the dvd was non-anamorphic, But fortunately, If you're watching this on a computer or an HDMI TV, then you could zoom in to a better format (though the subtitles would be cut off). I also knew that it was a bonus feature.  Other than those drawbacks/nitpicks, this is a satisfying box set. It DOES have the original versions of the trilogy despite it's controversial format. I DO agree that the original trilogy should be in an updated format, but if you can cope with or solve (via zooming aspect ratio) the format, you will be satisfied with this box set.
B000002KNU|3.0|Maybe it's looking back but \\"Psycho Killer\\" was such a powerful song on this album that the rest pale in comparison. It's a good album just not as consistent as Buildings or Fear Of Music which followed.<br /><br />Of those three this is the one I play the least now. I would rate only \\"Who Is It?\\" and \\"Pulled Up\\" as worthy of the Heads' lofty standards. The rest are just so-so but still far more listenable than most music now so don't let my slightly negative review put you off.<br /><br />I'm just saying, take it for what it's worth-- a terrific first album but far better was on the horizon back then.

B003QNXPUK|1.0|I purchased this because I have a Zagg skin on our little Kodak video camera. It's been great. The skin went on the iPhone 4s just fine. Within several days however, the corners started catching on every little thing. Pretty soon the edges were peeling and became covered in dust and lint and whatever else it came in contact with. Inside of a week we had to remove it because it was so bad. I have several Zagg products that I really like but this isn't one of the better ones.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I have been a Captain America fan for almost five decades, since I first saw him comic books in the mid-1960s.  I was a little uneasy before I saw the film, as some previous attempts to put him on movie screens and TV had been pretty disappointing.  But a great crew and great acting produced a film that was a joy from beginning to end.  The origin was wonderful, and Stanley Tucci did a wonderful job making Professor Erskine into more than just a cardboard character.  Chris Evans was great, and so was the rest of the cast.  Costuming was wonderful, they took what was in the comics and came up with versions that seemed more believable and worked better in real life.  Special effects were also wonderful, especially the way that Steve transformed from scrawny to super soldier.  And the vehicles were very well done, as they worked from many high tech designs the Nazi's had on the drawing boards, but were never able to produce during the real war.  All I can say is thank you, from a fan whose fondest wishes came true.
B000002KO3|3.0|All I remember about this album when it came out was the breakdancing dude in the video of one of the tunes (I believe it was \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\") which I thought a weird direction for the band to take.<br /><br />Certainly, \\"Once in A Lifetime\\" is a classic but other than this and the aforementioned \\"Crosseyed...,\\" I only like \\"Born Under Punches.\\"<br /><br />Coming on the heels of the Fear Of Music album, I felt this album was a letdown. I still rarely play the whole thing through from beginning to end.<br /><br />Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think this is one of the weakest releases by a terrific band.
1591843162|5.0|Again.  Definitely one of the best books I have read over the past couple of years.  Seth will make you think.  His writing style reads like a blog with nuggets of wisdom and inspiration all along the way.  Linchpin is a treatise on how to become indispensable.  He describes how to make a difference in your work life.  Full of great stories and examples, reading this book will provide you with plenty of ideas and examples about how to improve not just how you work, but why you work.<br /><br />My favorite part is his description of what we teach in schools.  After a long list of things that include \\"how to use a number two pencil\\" and \\"how to not stand out,\\" he then states what we should teach in schools and lists two things we should learn how to do in schools:  lead and solve interesting problems.  Imagine what our schools would look like if we took that advice.  We just might make a difference in the world around us.<br /><br />This is one of those books that you slow down near the end because you don't want to finish it.  Oh well, you can always read it again.

B000002KNY|5.0|One reviewer likened this to the Talking Heads' Revolver and it sort of seems like it was the album that showed that creative shift a la the Beatles did with the LP Revolver.<br /><br />This is my fave album by the Heads and mainly because it has everything from killer drivin' danceable rockout tunes to funky weird spacey sounds to lyrics that address the dichtomy of modern society. Plus this thing holds up well even now in the 21st century as one of the best albums of all-time (no hype, kids, buy this and you'll see your parents were not as square as you think).<br /><br />There really isn't a single duff track on this at all. Some are better than others, of course (mainly \\"Paper,\\" \\"Cities\\" and \\"Life During Wartime\\").<br /><br />Really deserves ten stars out of five.

B000002LBH|5.0|Although this album takes you only up through 1987 (so no songs from the Strangeways LP) it is about a great a collection of songs as any band's greatest hits. I do like the fact so many singles' B-sides were also thrown on here and it shows the Smiths had a TON of great songs.<br /><br />Now there are people who find the Smiths not their cup of tea, but to those who cannot appreciate at least the guitar work of Johnny Marr on tracks like \\"Ask,\\" \\"Half A Person\\" or \\"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\\" then you really need to get your ears tested.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|I loved the first hangover and I was a little suspicious of the sequel - turns out I was right.  It's the exact same plot as the first one, without the surprise or the humor.  Even the lost pictures at the end aren't really funny.
0307277887|5.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is the first of Jeff Lindsay's Dexter series. Dexter Morgan, damaged by a Traumatic Event in his extreme youth, is now a blood-spatter expert with Miami-Dade PD. Dexter is also a serial killer, but he works according to the Code of Harry, Harry being his late foster father, a good cop and a great human being. Dexter only kills people who really need it: other serial killers, mostly. Dexter's foster-sister, Deborah, also a cop with Miami PD, is sick of working vice and wants to advance to Homicide, but needs Dexter's help solving the current series of prostitute murders, which, strangely, bear some resemblance to Dexter's own work. The Dexter novels are full of black humour, excellent plot twists and interesting characters. Lindsay also manages to put in a good portion of the D section of the dictionary alliterating with the name of his main character. Readers who have seen the TV series of the same title will enjoy the novels even more, picturing the perfectly-cast Michael C. Hall as Dexter.
0060558121|3.0|I read a few dozen reader reviews with interest--in some cases, more interest than the book itself sustained.<br /><br />Yes, Mr Gaiman has a vivid imagination, and one of his main premises--that the old world gods wither in America, as succeeding generations cease to worship them--is a brilliant concept.<br /><br />But in the course of writing a long book over several years, a lot of other thoughts and influences muddied the literary waters in which he was 'swimming.' It is indeed quite odd that the war between old and new gods is dismissed in a page or two, after much warning and foreboding; it is even stranger that the book concludes with solving a mystery that wasn't an especially prominent plot point.<br /><br />On the plus side, there is a vivid imagination at play here. I suppose the contract a reader makes with a writer is to go where he is taken, and it's a tad unfair to complain that you \\"don't like the tangential stories\\" (I, for one, did) or \\"don't believe the protagonist's character\\" -- I tend to agree, and yet, the characterization IS the writer's prerogative...<br /><br />All in all, there are passages of dizzying, phantasmagorical imagery contrasted by plodding, dull stretches and a few too many side roads to travel. So 3 stars seems fair. The call for more clarity and better editing seem warranted, too. Fans of Neil Gaiman are the most likely to be pleased, whereas newcomers to his work, such as myself, might wonder quite what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's good to have a writer of fantasy/supernatural material reach and stretch for meaning and resonance. That he didn't quite there and wasn't too clear about the path is not a disgrace, just a mild disappointment.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game, I have never had cut the rope before only seen it, and its a great app!<br />tons of very addictive fun and lots of replay value!<br />Fun! Fun! Fun!
B00005QK5X|5.0|Having been lucky enough to see them live twice in Seattle (yes, we drove down from Vancouver especially to catch them), they blow any band these days out of the water. sadly, this is something they were unable to fully capture on vinyl. They came close but capturing their live sound was unattainable back in those days.<br /><br />Of the three discs, Is This Real? is the weakest as there are no tracks other than the classic \\"Alien Boy\\" (which is actually a single off an EP that wasn't on that first LP anyway) on there that stand out like, say, \\"Taking Too Long\\" or \\"NO Fair\\" on Youth of America (the title track that was a tour de force wall of sound live) or the first three tracks on Over The Edge as well as their best song \\"Romeo.\\"<br /><br />With box sets you get a lot of out-takes and different mixes which are really only for hardcore fans who need that as they just show why the band bagged these for official release. Having said that, I liked the \\"Youth of America\\" original miz far better.<br /><br />Add to that the artwork the Wipers did on their 1st and 3rd LPs as well as the peace symbol band logo is something you just don't see nowadays.<br /><br />A must buy for anyone interested in music when all the stuff that was good was ignored by radio. Ah, the '80s--the forgotten decade by all but ad execs in their 40s now who sometimes throw the odd Jam or Buzzcocks tune at us.

1612930859|4.0|Persuasion is the 6th published novel by Jane Austen. Anne Elliott is a sweet 27-year-old woman of good breeding and integrity. She is intelligent, thoughtful, considerate. This may come as a surprise, given that, after losing her mother at 14, she has been encumbered with a father, Sir Walter Elliot, and an older sister, Miss Elizabeth, who are both vain spendthrifts and find her inconsequential; both of whom are blind to the fact that Elizabeth's poorer \\"friend\\", the fawning Mrs Clay, is intent on marrying Sir Walter to become Lady Elliot. Her younger, married sister, Mary is selfish and self-centred. The only person in her life who cares about her at all is a friend of her mother's, Lady Russell, who, when Anne was nineteen, persuaded her not to accept the offer of sailor Frederick Wentworth, as he had no position. Lady Russell tries to persuade Anne, when her estranged cousin, William, heir to the Elliot estate, reappears, that it would be prudent to accept his offer. But Anne is suspicious of his change of attitude. This is the last full novel written by Jane Austen, probably her most mature novel, and it is a great pity she died not long after this novel was completed. This novel has intrigue and humour and, of course, romance. Truly enjoyable.
B005HPY8LU|4.0|I still think the lady scraems and needs a voice coach, but listen to the lyrics. Some remind me of those of Alanis Morsette on Jagged Little Pill. I am thinking of renaming myself MR. KNOW IT ALL after listening to Ms. Clarkson's song... how do I know how you feel! Right on Kelly.
0385535139|5.0|I love this book!  Well written, as usual, many funny moments, especially AC's name!  Moves fast, very interesting and ties together the plots, characters nicely!  Five Stars!!!!!
B000002L80|4.0|This is probably the album where the Talking Heads took their sound more into a poppy (without being wimpy, eh) direction. It's a worthy addition to your collection but it's not really a dance record overall.<br /><br />\\"Road to Nowhere\\" sort of sums up both the band's sound and its direction at this time. They seemed ready to go somewhere with their sound and although not super commercial it was a far cry from \\"Psycho Killer\\" or \\"The Big Country.\\"

0385534639|1.0|I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THIS BOOK AND AM VERY  DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE TO SAY THAT I JUST DIDN'T ENJOY IT. IT   WAS LIKE THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TOO HARD WITH HER DESCRIPTIVE  WRITING BUT THERE WAS NO PLOT AND VERY LITTLE CHARACTER DEVE-  LOPMENT. THE COVER ART IS GORGEOUS BUT IT JUST GOES TO PROVE   THE OLD SAYING THAT \\"YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER\\"! I   WOULD ADVISE TO OTHER READERS THAT INSTEAD OF WASTING THEIR   TIME TRYING TO SLOG THROUGH THIS BOOK TO INSTEAD READ RAY   BRADBURY'S CLASSIC BOOK \\"SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES\\"  ABOUT A SINISTER CARNIVAL THAT MYSTERIOUSLY ROLLS INTO A   SMALL MIDWESTERN TOWN.
B0000004V2|5.0|With over 200 reviews I'd say this review is just filler at this point. So let me just add that this is as close to perfection as, say, Echo & the Bunnymen's Heaven Up Here is.<br /><br />The other thing that gets me every time I listen to this album is how a band can do an over eight-minute song (\\"I am the Resurrection\\") that is not only presumptuous (let's face it this song is about the Stone Roses' sound resurrecting a Brit music scene that was in a post-punk down cycle) but rocks out.<br /><br />Throw in the buildup to \\"I Wanna Be Adored,\\" the breath Ian Brown takes before \\"Sugar Spun Sister\\" starts to John Squire's transcendent guitar playing and this is an album that will hold up for decades.
B005LB1MY6|4.0|After the adrenaline-filled house antics of \\"Cross\\", \\"Audio, Video, Disco\\" understandably ruffled a few feathers, because it's a great shift in focus. But it's a great shift. AVD (as I shall call it henceforth) has a lot more to do with 70s synth pop than French house music. If Daft Punk had gone in a different direction, I could see them making something in this genre. The title means \\"I Hear, I See, I Learn\\" and it's so fitting. This album is not in-your-face like its (awesome) forerunner, but a cracking listen that stands on its own merits.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I have never been a fan of the first two tracks, \\"Horsepower\\" and \\"Civilization\\", both of whom sound anthemic and big but rarely grab me. It's first with the low-key \\"Ohio\\" that magic really begins to reveal itself. The song is simpler than even the simplest on \\"Cross\\", and is light and breezy, yet oh so captivating. Why \\"Canon\\" had to be split in two tracks is anyone's guess, but both parts are very catchy.<br /><br />It's from track 6 onwards, however, when AVD really becomes a winner. \\"On'N'On\\" is one of my favourites, with a steady beat and a gripping melody that's interestingly centered on the singer. Racing from \\"Brianvision\\" all the way through the supersonic closing track is a gamut of winners. \\"New Lands\\" has a very catchy chorus and \\"Helix\\" ought to delight even the most jaded \\"Cross\\" fans.<br /><br />AVD is a very brave, successful shift in tone. It doesn't try to be a \\"Cross: Part 2\\", but rather a stand-alone work that does the synth pop genre (fused with some rock tones) proud.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|I was never a Kate Bush fan except I liked a few of her singles and eventually\\"Ariel\\", which completely changed my opinion of her. In ways \\"50 Words For Snow\\" sounds like a deeper investigation into the realms of the soul and beauty found in the ordinary world. Unlike \\"Ariel\\", Ms. Bush weaves all the songs together in a song cycle where she finds the rise and fall and eventual rebirth in life and matters of the heart in the creation, falling, building structures (i.e. snowmen) and the eventual melting. Some of the musical forms parallels the work of the great Meredith Monk and other 20th c. avant garde and experimental sound composers. With it Ms. Bush achieves a level of artistic expression and emotional depth that is rarely heard in pop/rock music. There is tremendous beauty found here. With the exception of Lindsey Buckingham, Ms. Bush is one of the few musicians in her fourth decade of work that is making music that is as good, and as fresh, and as excellent as her earlier records.  \\"50 Words for Snow)\\" is easily one of the years best releases and one of Kate Bush's finest records of her career.

B0051E9INK|4.0|The original cult classic is a guilty pleasure. Useful, too, for its glimpse of mid-80s Manhattan (as the first [[ASIN:B00005N5S5 Terminator]] did for L.A.). Everyone wore long coats back then to conceal shotguns and swords. Good times.<br /><br />Although the theme of immortality had been explored on screen long before Highlander--I have a fondness for the 1960 Twilight Zone episode, [[ASIN:B00004S89H Long Live Walter Jameson]]--the story maintains interest here, at least before it was spun into countless sequels. Christopher Lambert is good enough. Sean Connery overplays his mentor role, reprised the very next year in [[ASIN:B00029NKU6 The Untouchables]] and then again in [[ASIN:B000B8GT92 Rising Sun]]. The real winners are Clancy Brown (as The Kurgan) and Queen, the latter for one of the best rock [[ASIN:B000000OAX soundtracks]] ever.<br /><br />I watched this on cable, but the disc to get seems to be [[ASIN:B001JFZ118 this one]].

B000QGAU4E|5.0|Funny moments. Novel plot. Excellent action. Flawless cinematography. Seriously, there's an action scene thats about 10 minutes long that's a single cut. And the story line is not centered around a romantic relationship or just general blood-lust! I don't know why every review of this isn't 5 stars.
B000HF6XKO|4.0|I was not disappointed by Syriana or its involved, complex plot, which mirrors, one can be sure, the sorts of back-stabbing, nationalistic, money-grubbing that inform the nonfictional book that the movie is based on. The cast is great, delivering both nuanced presentations and over-the-top portrayals of the cast of lawyers, fanatics, executives, operatives, and officials who run the world and its cartels, those who have sold their souls for money beyond measure and those who delve for deeper meaning in life.<br /><br />There are questions and there are answers here, but they don't always lead to clearcut outcomes. The movie twists and turns, relying on the viewer to keep juggling, keeping sorting, keep thinking, sometimes dismissing entrenched notions to recognize that power and corruption are so linked and so absolute that lives are just part of the currency.<br /><br />Those who want easy entertainment or James Bond action should go elsewhere as Syriana, for all intents, is art replicating life. It's not pretty or easy.
B006OB3K1A|5.0|Directed by Steve McQueen, \\"Shame\\" explores sexual addiction, alienation, and loneliness in contemporary New York City. With its many sex scenes, the film manages to be unerotic. The movie and its actors have received numerous accolades.  The acting is convincing and the scenes of city life well drawn. Many viewers will find this film disturbing.<br /><br />The film stars Michael Fassbender as a successful 30ish professional named Brandon who cannot control his sexual appetites or channel his sexuality into a relationship. Brandon is both a predator and a victim. He is apparently able to pick up attractive similarly lonely women on the spot for short encounters. Brandon also uses the services of prostitutes.  When he is home alone, he watches pornography and camgirls on his computer. He gets confronted with a wide range of pornographic material on his office computer. He is unable to function in an attempted relationship with a coworker, Marianne, (Nichole Beharie) which involves attempted emotion beyond sex. Fassbender plays this role well in his lines, dress, gestures, and facial expressions. He has a sense of decency and is at war with himself.<br /><br />The other primary character in \\"Shame\\" is Brandon's younger sister Sissie played by Carrie Mulligan. Sissie has suicidal tendencies and is emotionally needy. She moves in with Brandon early in the film and the emotional tension mounts between the siblings as the movie progresses. Each sees the serious, devastating issues in the life of the other. Brandon's sexual addition and his relationship with Sissie become intertwined and form the two themes of this movie.<br /><br />The movie makes have use of atmosphere to establish the sordid character of Brandon's mind. There are many scenes of crowded subways which capture the lonely, solitary character of much urban life.  There are pick-up scenes in bars, from the fancy to the seedy, which stress lack of emotional connection. The movie shows several scenes of paid sex between Brandon and various women together with the shame and sadness felt by both parties. The musical score is ominous and brooding, punctuated by Glenn Gould playing Bach and by various pop songs. Sissie is trying to make it as a singer and, in a pivotal scene of the movie, offers a rendition of \\"New York New York\\" in the company of Brandon and his boss.<br /><br />The movie includes substantial nudity, male and female. To their credit, the producers declined to soften the movie to receive an \\"R\\" rather than a \\"NC-17\\" rating. The movie offers an effective portrayal of how sex can become a narcotic to deal with loneliness in a harsh world.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanwomen together with the shame and sadness felt by both parties.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|Awesome product everything I expected and more. This cover is thin enough that I can still carry my fire in my purse!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I am reviewing the E6 with a Ipod classic 120GB and Klipsh S4 headphones with a LOD F9.<br /><br />It is a good product? I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could. I think it is better than a 3 butt not worthy of a 4 at least in my setup. The sound quality of the E6 compared to the Ipod straight out to headphones is really minor. I really had to listen closely and A/B between the two quite a bit. I did notice the stronger signal coming from the E6 that gave the sound a slight improvement butt only slightly in my opinion. Where the E6 shines and why I do use it on the go is this. When I drive the Ipod at a high volume,it will overdrive the amp and over a period of couple of songs the amp starts to get over driven compromising the sound quality. The E6 however driven at the same DB(volume level as the ipod at max level) does not over drive the amp even after hours of listening and it has headroom to spare. In that regard it makes carrying another piece of equipment on the go worth while.<br /> On a side note, I read the specs on the E6 and the E7 and it seems they are the same as far as the power amp side of it. It seems the only difference of the two is the E7 is of course a DAC as well as an amp. As far as the four tonal options on the amp. I like the blue and do listen to the E6 in that EQ setting once in a while butt mainly listen with the EQ off//flat. As far a recommending this product I say yes. Is it worth $30 after S&H?? I say yes. If it would have cost more than that I think I would however packaged it back up and would have sent it back.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Not because I liked it. I found it depressing. It was full of thoughts that I don't agree with - or perhaps I simply don't want to agree with because I'm not a deep thinker.  I just wanted to get to the end, and I did.  The story certainly described the Glory of War very well. Any veteran would probably agree with me on that.  Reading it made me want to write my own famous Vietnam War novel. It could start something like this:  \\"I first saw Vietnam from the deck of the USS Dupont (DD-941). It was the dark of night - but it wasn't. As far as the eye could see the coast glowed as bright as day from illumination flares that floated slowly down on little parachutes. I think that this was meant to keep the VC from getting a good night's sleep, but they were cozy in their tunnels from what I hear.\\"  ...  \\"Life on a destroyer wasn't all bad. At least the food was good. From time to time Navy Seals would come alongside in their Swift boats for a good meal and icecream. Note the shrunken heads on ropes around some of their necks. They shrunk them themselves. So it's said.\\"
B00447G29S|5.0|I read many product reviews before purchasing this item.  The 3D Blu Ray is sensational, with a remarkably clear and impacting 3D image.  Definitely five stars. Evidently though, from previously reading the reviews, the 3D DVD and anaglyph versions both sound like a flop.  Get the Blu Ray format and forget the others, but first make sure you have the gear (3D Blu Ray player, 3D TV, glasses) to show it as intended. If you get the 3D in Blu Ray you will thoroughly enjoy the movie!

B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Having fallen in love with the wolves of Mercy Falls I was sad to read that the series had come to end.<br /><br />Packed with lots of drama that surrounded real life events-- it was enough to keep not only myself at the edge of my seat throughout; but it kept my daughter in tears. Macy kept the Kleenex Corporation rolling in big bucks with this one through the very end.<br /><br />One point Macy made at the end of the book I thought was a wonderful idea so if the author reads her reviews maybe Ms. Maggie Stiefvater will as well.<br /><br />\\"Though she has told all she want to write in a book and the Wolves story as a whole has ended maybe she will treat us with special short stories of the whole gang in one of those book where they collect short stories about great books by different authors. Maybe she will write about Sam & Cole taking Grace & Isabel to the prom or their weeding. You never know, right mom?\\"<br /><br />And the children shall lead them... I couldn't have said more simple. I loved sharing this series with my daughter and I hope other mother's enjoy it as well.<br /><br />Disclosure: I participated in Books for Review Club and a copy was provided to me by the author.

B000063DFS|4.0|This is another amazing album by Ozzy. Its so good as his first 2 albums in his sollo career. It has really amazing songs like : I dont want to change the world - Mama im coming home - No more tears - Hellraiser - Zombie Stomp. The rest songs are very good also (its just that they are not so good as the first ones i have already mentioned.) If you are new to ozzy or dont have this album - just buy it . You would probably like it.

Eventually, when they come out with a new special movie pack it may take up twice as much space on the shelf.

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|The Band Perry is rapidly becoming one of my favorite bands. Kimberly Perry has an amazing voice that cuts into your soul whether she's singing the melancholy \\"If I Die Young\\" or the blunt \\"You Lie.\\" Unlike other popular country artists who are more pop than anything, The Band Perry has somehow managed to capture the world's attention with their insightful, young, fresh, and deeply poetic lyrics. \\"If I Die Young\\" is the most well known song from the album because of it's unique sound and Adele-like ambigious meanings. However, \\"All Your Life\\" and \\"Lasso\\" are just as heartfelt and deep seeded in emotional range. \\"Miss You Being Gone\\" and \\"Double Heart\\" are just two of the energetic songs that contradict with the rest of the album, but it works. Kimberly Perry puts just as much anger and satire into those as she does with every other song.   This is one of the best albums I ever bought. Kimberly's soothing voice mixed with the guitars, violins, etc. and the poetry of her lyrics make for an unique sound in a time when originality is hard to find.   There is not one bad song on this album. They are all equally fantastic and speak to each different emotion a person can have. They are indeed bringing country back.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|by far the worst album of all time and thats hard for me to say since i live in a world where bands like nsync and the backstreetboys have put out albums, if you want to spend money go ahead but dont say i didnt warn you

B0049P1VHS|5.0|i watch this show semi religiously i watched it when it come on tv, i watched it on netflix dozens of times and i got the first season for christmas and when i opened it i saw the walking dead and i went nuts but it wasnt what we all expect from shows, usually you get a complete season of any show its this huge 2inch more then 2 cds with about a dozen episodes spread across them. so i was kind baffled when it was the size of a normal dvd case. and then i remembered that the first season was only 6 episodes, which then i was very happy that amc didnt try to do what all the other tv shows do which was make a big package to have a excuse to over charge you for the product and i was so over all i highly recommend buying this even if you have never heard or watched this show, its a must if you like the horror or zombie genres

Very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />I am always looking for inspiring and practical decorating tips for my room and shared apartment. Even though I have a small space, this book has some great tips about where to place furniture for example and wall hangings, how to mix and match colours and how to make all of the styles I love, work together. Domino has a great eye for detail.<br /><br />I come back to this book every time I want a change and still love flipping through the pictures. Even if the rooms are not to your taste, there is a fresh idea on each page. If you are still deciding whether to buy this decorating book -- do it!
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|This item arrived promptly, and within the timeline I was given. It was a Christmas gift for my wife, and I was glad to see that it came in a nice box and worked perfectly right out of the box. After about 20 minutes of practicing the commands I was able to perform all of them quite easily. The commands are simple, and intuitive. I was pleasantly surprised that it can take the input from several different remote controls without having to change any of the steps to \\"teach\\" it the codes; Now my wife and I can use just this wand instead of 3 different remotes for our TV/Blu-Ray set up! The only thing I wish I could do, is teach it new actions. It comes with 13 already known (in other words, you can program up to 13 remote functions), but I would love to be able to teach it new patterns for new functions!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm a very novice book reviewer as, typically, I just tell friends I enjoyed it and that spurs them on to pick it up themselves, but here's my concise take on this book.<br /><br />It's an excellent read, but not for those without patience. George Martin takes his time to develop an intricately woven story with it's fair share of moving parts. His attention to small details is phenomenal and adds new depth to the story. I found myself recalling small details from chapters past as I read the book, admiring how a small seemingly innocuous word could have such a large meaning a few pages later. This fantasy novel doesn't progress through major battles, like other fantasy novels might, and at first I was a bit off-put by it. I was so accustomed to being fed scene after scene of battles that I almost didn't continue reading, a mistake I narrowly avoided. The magic is in the fine print. He's a storyteller, the \\"how they made it\\" is almost as exciting as the \\"why\\", and the consequences are even more so. The book strings you along by changing the character being narrated. At some points you're an honorable father, in others a fearful damsel, but each chapter leaves you feeling incomplete, you must read on to reach the cadence.<br /><br />All in all, this story is well thought out, well written, and pulls you in. If you don't believe me, pick up the trial of the book using any kindle application, be it phone, pc, or tablet. The first chapter is as good as any (and the trial goes much further than that!)
0240815807|5.0|As soon as I got the book, I randomly flipped through some of the pages and found several excellent tips just in the first few minutes.  I have been recording music in my home for over 15 years.  I don't claim to know everything about recording, but I've been around the block a few times and still found very worthwhile information.  I believe this book will make a very nice addition to my collection of resources... and likely yours too.  I kinda wish the information was laid out in a more \\"block-like\\" manner to make it easier to use as a quick reference, but I imagine the author wanted to be heard, not used :).  So, expect to spend a little sit-down time with this book.  The writing style is also very simple, which is what I like.  I hate it when authors try to use complex, and sophisticated writing techniques to prove their writing skills.  This is a straight forward book about mixing.  Also, don't be deterred if you are new to recording.  This is a good book for anyone serious about putting out a good audio project.  Put it on your shelf and keep it dust-free!

0374290024|5.0|Very informative, well researched.  If you take your time and look at the data, go to his website and look at even more data, then you can see the time and effort put into this book.  A question such as this cannot be simply answered by looking at just history or economics, and this book looks at several different disciplines and takes them into account.  He points out potential weaknesses of his argument and how they were dealt with as much as possible, showing trends through time instead of the precise data that is impossible to come by for much of history.  Well Done, I enjoyed it immensely.
0060763280|5.0|I got this book a few weeks ago with the intent to make 2012 the year I become financially free. A close friend suggested this book. After reading it, I see that this is THE book that does what others fail to do - give actionable steps. Other books dance around the subject of getting rich. Other books are written by people who never \\"did\\" what they they are talking about. There are people who can give you tools to succeed, but without the right mindset you will continue to fail. I am just finishing section one and this book has already started to help me see the mindset that has held me back and build a Millionaire Mindset.  If your in Scottsdale AZ, join me at Dilly's Deli at 7:30am on Tuesdays to discuss this book with others reading it.

0307916812|3.0|Let me start this review by saying the book is very good - 4 to 4 1/2 stars.  This critique is only for the audio CD , or if you prefer the audiobook, version of The Son of Neptune and not the actual story by Mr. Riordan.  After listening to the entire Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, including The Demigod Files, as well as the first two part of The Heroes of Olympus, I came to the conclusion that narrator Jesse Bernstein did a job so good that any other narrators would have a difficult time maintaining the standards he set with this group of characters.  Mr. Bernstein was able to make the books really come to life by doing a great job in giving each one of the multitude of characters their own distinct personality. In The Lost Hero as well The Son of Neptune, his successor did not match these standards.  Although Joshua Swanson made an occasional personality really stand out, such as Coach Hedge in the first book and the Gorgon Sisters in this book, his narration for most of the book lacked the intensity and passion that was put in by Mr. Bernstein.  To be honest, I felt he narrated with a monotonous tone without emotion in several parts.  Although this may be overly harsh on Mr. Swanson as part of this difference in narration may be a result from the change in points of view.  In the Percy Jackson and the Olympians, we experienced the adventures from Percy Jackson's first person perspective while The Heroes of Olympus have been seen from the third person perspective and that perspective is from three separate main characters.<br /><br />In addition, it would have been nice if Mr. Swanson did his best to have kept the voices similar to the pattern established by Mr. Bernstein.  For example in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Hephaestus had a New York-like accent while in The Lost Hero, he sounded like grandfather from the rural part of the Midwest.  However, I can accept a difference from Mr. Bernstein's voice for Ares and Mr. Swanson's interpretation of Mars as one is the Greek version of the God of War while the other is Roman - different personalities might equal different voices.<br /><br />I imagine Mr. Swanson is under contract to finish The Heroes of Olympus series, but one can hope for the return of Jesse Bernstein in the Mark of Athena or if there is a third story arc dealing with Camp Half-blood and the Greek pantheon of deities.  Or maybe even he will return to read the future series Mr. Rick Riordan announced that will revolve around Odin, Thor and the rest of the Norse pantheon.ne is the Greek version of the God of War while the other is Roman - different personalities might equal different voices.

Some of the routers, such as netgears, D-links, are bad. Use linksys instead. I pointed out Linksys because that was the router I've used when I confronted problems with weak wireless signals. Just because the router streams well other electronic devices does not necessarily mean it has the capability to work well with all other electronic devices. Linksys 2000, 2500 and up will get the job done.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|I bought these for my and my son's Kindle Fires.  Mine is pink and his is white.  The case is a hard plastic that protects the Kindle when dropped.  The cover, a softer plastic, is held in place by an elastic strap that is more than adequate for protection.  What is really nice is that when the cover is open, there is a groove that you can put the edge of the cover into so that the cover supports the Kindle at an ergonomic reading angle.  I really like reading this way with the Kindle horizontal.

1401233066|4.0|This volume, FABLES Vol. 16: SUPER TEAM, collects issues #101-107 and is bookended by two self-contained stories. \\"The Ascent\\" kicks things off and offers a catch-up peek into doings in the Fables' lost business office. In this one-off, the blue winged monkey, Bufkin, hero of the realm of the lost business office, scales an ancient giant tree and somehow ends up back in his homeworld of Oz. Thereabouts he begins to foment a revolution, of which we can be sure to hear more in due time. Just not now. \\"Waking Beauty\\" closes out the volume and catches us up with - as Bill Willingham puts it - \\"the life and restful times of one of our long overlooked friends, as she continues sleeping on the job.\\" Just goes to show, nature abhors a vacuum. In the Homelands, in the ashes of the Old Empire, assorted warlords vie to become the new head cheese. One such has figured out that one way to power is to lift the enchantment from the sleeping Briar Rose. But he's not the only one to have worked this out.<br /><br />Getting to the meat of the matter: As things stand, Mr. Dark had sown waste to Fabletown and had driven the Fables out of Manhattan. Recently, Frau Totenkinder had failed to properly contain Mr. Dark, who escaped his confines, forcing the Fables to flee the Farm in upstate New York and seek refuge in the kingdom of Haven. There's nowhere else to go after this, should Haven fall. And here's Mr. Dark now, very close to ripping thru the mystic barrier that keeps him from stepping over into Haven. Day by day Flycatcher's magic is failing him.<br /><br />With Frau Totenkinder officially retired (fully deserving of her happy ending), Ozma has assumed leadership of the spooky witches what used to dwell on the 13th floor of Fabletown's Woodlands Hotel. Ozma means to assemble a strike force - composed of the fiercest and most fearless in the Fables community - to take on the malevolent Mr. Dark, except that Pinnochio suggests a loopy embellishment: Why not form a superhero team?<br /><br />Pinnochio, an avid comic book fan, persuades Ozma that - in the interest of \\"every little bit helps\\" - it may be worth harnessing the faith and belief generated by a population of Mundy comic book fans. And as you know, belief is what sustains the Fables, the Mundy's belief in fairy tales and folk stories and nursery rhymes and such. Pinnochio himself has fully committed to his cape & cowl persona, having parked his butt in a wheelchair, noting that a lot of super team chiefs seem to be handicapped so. I was halfway expecting him to cry, \\"To me, my Fables.\\" It's an indication of how desperate Ozma must've truly felt, that she'd go along with this whiff of silly.<br /><br />Willingham also introduces a side plot with truly disastrous potential. Bigby Wolf learns that his implacable elemental father, the North Wind, means to kill Ghost, Bigby's invisible zephyr cub and the North Wind's grandson. This all has to do with a proclamation the North Wind had issued ages ago, about not suffering freak monstrosities to live.<br /><br />After the debacle called The Great Fables Crossover, here's Bill Willingham again experimenting with meta-storytelling, except that, this time, he's doing it proper. It's a lot of fun watching Pinnochio do his damndest to ensure that the Fables conform to all manner of superhero tropes, working feverishly to get the costumes and the code names just right. I grinned big when I saw the superhero roll call which opens issue #104. There's something pretty priceless in seeing the likes of Bigby (a.k.a. \\"The Werewolf Man\\"), Ozma (\\"Super Witch\\"), and Thumbelina (\\"Tiny Titan\\") outfitted in garish crimefighting threads. And don't tell me that Brock Blueheart isn't playing the Green Lantern analog. The F-Men, indeed. F-Men assemble!! Heh.<br /><br />Since this is FABLES, the story arc doesn't take you where you anticipate. Bill Willingham has something else in mind. Frankly, how he goes about resolving the problem of Mr. Dark is more satisfyingto me, although I can see how other readers may disagree, seeing as how Willingham had seemingly set the stage so carefully for a dramatic and epic conflict, but then - bam! - here, eat some anticlimactic pie. But I like the unpredictability of this series, and I'm glad things didn't degenerate into a big stale superhero fighty fight, even if it does leave the \\"F-Men\\" sort of just milling around and Brock Blueheart entertaining some pretty lame aftermath conclusions regarding his deity Boy Blue. As an added treat, we finally get a glimpse of the person who had roused Rose Red from her horrid apathy at the Farm. Except that geting a glimpse doesn't translate to knowing just who in heck this person is. Willingham also introduces some food for thought, future plot points concerning a prophecy for Rose Red and the identity of the North Wind's successor.<br /><br />As ever, Mark Buckingham and Steve Leialoha's now iconic artwork is invaluable. These guys are the perfect artists for FABLES. They draw Bigby Wolf, my favorite character here, the only way he should be drawn. I'm glad he didn't get stuck in \\"superhero\\" mode for too long. Wolverine and Timber Wolf don't need that kind of competition.to me, although I can see how other readers may disagree, seeing as how Willingham had seemingly set the stage so carefully for a dramatic and epic conflict, but then - bam! - here, eat some anticlimactic pie.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie and the book which originally inspired it undoubtedly takes some liberties with explaining race and gender relations.<br /><br />I watched it as a person with disabilities who did grow up with my own restrictions and laws. The book and this film does not deal with disability (except for fleeting references to cancer in Skeeter's mother), but I could certainly relate to the experiences and issues raised in 'The Help'.<br /><br />I give the screenplay kudos for publically explaining that the women did face discrimination and segregation on a regular basis. It realistically portrays the numerous rules and customs which governed the mobility of Abileen and the other domestic workers in 1960's Jackson. Limited mobility translated into difficult and limited life choices.<br /><br />When Skeeter 'really' interviews Aibileen, both are obviously cautious when she goes to the house in the 'Negro' part of town. Having researched State laws then on the books, Skeeter visibly starts to understand how much trouble these interviews could actually cause. It is different than asking a domestic to 'help' answer a newspaper advice column.<br /><br />Because she is not undertaking this assignment lightly, she then wins over the trust of Minny and others who were initially more skeptical of motives for wanting to write about 'their' lives.  They come to trust Skeeter, forming a multi-cultural sisterhood out of the business arrangment.<br /><br />Of course, you would be skeptical too after a life-time of mistreatment, having to clean up for others for inadequate pay. The domestics could not even use the in-house toilets of their employers! And they witnessed the abuse which these 'good' women subject their own families to, refusing to change a child's soiled diaper until their morning arrival.<br /><br />While I'm uneasy how much gennuine 'care' a domestic actually felt towards the children of their employers, arriving at a house and seeing a young child in soiled clothing had to be troubling and frustrating because of inevitably produced health problems. Proving the insanity of racism, the domestics were actually being stereotyped as the 'unclean' ones!<br /><br />Bryce Dallas Howard gives a great performance as the evil Hilly Holbrook. This president of the Jackson Junior League is so interested in collecting canned food for 'poor starving children in Africa'. Holbrook thne ironically chooses to ignore the extreme poverty and violent conditions her own domestic and others routinely face every single day because of Jim Crow Laws. Becoming a domestic was the only kind of work which these women were able to obtain!<br /><br />And then, several neighbors believe that only a 'negress' wrote the book-within-a-movie which eventually gets published from these interviews. The idea that another white person could be interested enough to listen to 'those people' is genuinely unfathomable: Domestics are expected to listen to families as part of their job, but their employers aren't ever expected to recognize their hard work.<br /><br />An exception is Ceila Foote who is herself 'different' in this era. She is recovering from a series of miscarriages and really does need an extra pair of hands as part of her road to recovery. She proactively eats in the kitchen with Minny and provides Minny with the care to escape domestic violence which Hilly and other employers never would. This actually shocks the usually-outspoken Minny. She recognizes that important cultural and social barriers were being broken--wanting them finally broken and actually getting to this point were two very different actions.<br /><br />As much as she needs a job, Minny is intially unsure if Ceila is playing some kind of 'game' with her. Unlike Hilly, the lower-income Celia is less concious of the racial barriers of the era. She and her husband (who actually might have harassed Minny in another screenplay) are sincerely nice to Minny.<br /><br />An obvious strength of this movieand why I was interested in seeing it was that the civil rights movement is used as backdrop. It shows everyday people actually working to change their difficult conditions during the era, something which should still resonate in our era of Occupy Wall Street. The women weren't just passively accepting the discrimination and segregation which was very much a part of their daily lives. And they are also very much concious of 'national' events such as President Kennedy's and Medgar Evers's assassination, without themselves being these 'famous' names.<br /><br />Skeeter did help the domestics initially tell their stories. But Aibileen and her colleagues are the only ones who were then capable of taking the received book royalty money and deciding what to do with it. They helped each other and themselves make a better life.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the menu design--which looks like it was pirated. The movie itself is awesome.and why I was interested in seeing it was that the civil rights movement is used as backdrop.

0385341008|5.0|There are always books that make you angry, hurtful, pissed beyond pissed and then turn you around with so much love and positive admiration, you wonder if you could ever live through what they had to live through.  It's not slavery, but it's close, memories and written letters of death, heartache, lies, and so much hurt during the war with remembrances of the Holocaust.  Don't think you may not be able to read it because it deals with so evilness, it's the power of Juliet and the people she writes to and they write back of their spiritual and mental power.<br /><br />I started reading this book on a Friday and did not leave my house for anything until I found out who survived and who found love and compassion.  One particular character gave her life to stop the Nazi's from beating her friend because she needed to go to the bathroom.  My heart got filled with so much anger and a few minutes later it got filled with so much love.  I'm still reading it over and over again to just keep that compassion and love in my heart for everyone.  Please, please read it.  Books can change your life and this one will also.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003TLMVVI African American Books on the Kindle Blog]]

B005H0IW6W|5.0|I've enjoyed Michael Buble's CHRISTMAS and Paul Anka's DECEMBER SONGS this year while decorating the tree, baking, or just sitting around the house. They're comforting albums in an ever-changing world where your favorite things seem to fade away and modern music sometimes sounds so harsh and grating. So glad I got them both, as I love the classic, vintage sound that still has a modern feel to it. They both bring back that feeling of Christmas as a kid, when you're hearing your parents' Christmas albums. Buble says he intended to give people that feeling like he had growing up and hearing the Bing Crosby Christmas album played over and over at his house around Christmas.   I never liked ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU (or any cover of it) until I heard Buble's version! I can't pick a favorite on this album--I just love listening to the whole thing over and over. Such beautiful 'old school' arrangements that still sound very 'today.' Perfect selection of songs show-casing Michael Buble's voice and song style-ings.   Buble's CHRISTMAS and Anka's DECEMBER SONGS are Christmas standards for me now. From now on, anyone who comes to my house from December 1st - 25th is going to hear these records playing, and I think they will be hooked like I am. Get them both now, along with Josh Groban's NOEL and Andrea Bocelli's MY CHRISTMAS, and your house will be set for Christmas atmosphere each holiday season. If you have children or grandchildren around, you will be setting some good Christmas memories for them--note that at the end of his liner notes for this album, Buble writes to his parents, \\"Thanks for playing that Bing record.\\"

0393338827|3.0|If you're looking for a fairly detailed description of Wall Street's role in the subprime mortgage mess, then this is a good read.  This is more than a 101 course on the cause of the \\"Great Recession\\" but it's not quite on a graduate level.  It's important to emphasize that this book is solely focused on the investment banks that securitized subprime debt and the investors that bought/sold these securities or their derivatives.  As a society, we like to have a single common enemy that can be blamed for catastrophes or an unfortunate turn of events.  Lewis understands this and panders to his readers (and potential customers of his book).  Investment banks certainly fed the beast of the subprime machine, however there are points further down this supply chain where individuals were intentionally committing fraudulent acts that were at worst criminal and at best morally despicable. Our author makes brief mention of the front line conmen that sold subprime/floating rate/balloon payment loans to customers who would have easily qualified for high quality 30 year interest rate locked loans for their home.    The collection of prophetic protagonists (Burry, Lippman, Eisman, Cornwall Capital,etc) was mildly interesting.  Lewis overestimated his diving depth into the life of hedge fund manager, (Mike Burry) who clearly made a good bet ahead of the MBS/CDO/CDS collapse, but the details surrounding his journey upon becoming investor missed the mark as being relevant to his investment.  Likewise, I found the \\"garage incarnation\\" of Cornwall Capital to be interesting, leaving me impressed with their entrepreneurship and strategic fortitude for their investment selection. The made a sound progression of trades from their investment of buying risk on the triple BBB rated mezzanine tranches of collateralized debt obligations to their savvy exit of these contracts to avoid the counterparty risk with Bear Stearns.  But their history leading up to their actions isn't all that relevantto collapse of the economy, other than fitting perfectly into the cookie cutter mold of David standing up to Goliath.  In a way, Lewis used this economic calamity as a biographical vessel for some of our \\"heroes\\" who's story probably wouldn't sell stand alone hardbacks on their own.   They say a rising tide lifts all boats, during this chain reaction of events the receding tide of mortgage defaults beached most boats in the global economy. (It's important to note that this was not limited to the United States) Lewis tells a good story, and as any good story teller would admit, there is embellishment and exclusion of facts that paint the compete picture.  All in all, this is a well written narrative that boils down one of the most important events in modern American history into 300 pages.

B005HIBWFW|5.0|The late Ken Russell consolidated his film-making career with a series of the lives of artists (usually composers) for the BBC most of which episodes were great. Then he started making feature length films and his first 5 are extraordinary and the life of Tchaikovosky (The Music Lovers) was about the best of them. Still strong in the visuals and the melding of images with the composers' better works. Less durable has been the acting of Chamberlain but perhaps that's a result of subsequent overexposure. Slightly less daring now as well since homosexuality has become much more mainstream since 1971.

0446556750|1.0|This book started out well and created interesting possibilities, and then just ended with a thud.  More  to the point, there was no ending - The pages just stopped.  It felt like a complete cheat - it was either a brain freeze by the author (unlikely), or a shameless come-on to buy the next book.  Not going to happen - it is fine to create a character and a franchise, but each book needs to stand on its own as a complete story, and this one failed miserably.  There are many better mystery choices out there.
0525423656|2.0|So I read Matched, and was delighted to know I didn't  have to wait long for crossed.  I finished it in less than 24 hours, but the truth is, I think I kept turning the pages thinking, ok, something really good is about to happen.  But no.  No Society.  No Officials.  No big surprise, no betrayal that I saw.  They ran, and ran, and ran, but the antagonist never once was even close on their heels.  Or at least, it seemed that way to me.  Then in the end, Cassia obediently does what shes told (apparently because her reaction didn't get it's own chapter).  Ky's character seems a little broken, and Cassia seems more in love with the idea of rebellion than with Ky.  That's ok, I suppose, but in the end, that isn't even acknowledged....they are stil pining for each other when they want very different things.  Further more, The rising seems an awful lot like the Society.  So far, the only \\"Free people\\" in the book seem to be the farmers, who apparently live in third world country-like conditions and are easily annihilated by either the Society or The Rebellion.    *spoiler*  Another thing; there is this great moment when Ky chooses to burn a map to society in order to protect Cassia from what he sees as danger and disappointment.  While what he does is motivated by love, he is mimicking the actions of the Society; taking away free choice for someone's \\"good\\".  This moment falls completely flat when his character fails to see or even truly repent this action.  Furthermore, for someone given almost no choice in his life, he seems awfully eager to inflict such restrictions on another life.  There should have been this moment there when the two of them both realized how easy it would be to become the thing they hated most...but that just didn't happen.
B005SJIP2S|3.0|First let me say this is one of the best SOUNDING live recordings I have ever heard, beautifully captured instruments and vocals (although they were smart enough to bury Steve Howe's; sorry, Steve) But what strikes me about this the most are the ridiculously slow tempos. I wonder if this is the band's fault (deciding to bring things back) or Alan White's (age, lol) or perhaps Benoit wanting to milk EVERY Jon Anderson nuance he can. Those that own Fly From Here notice how he sounds NOTHING like Jon on those tracks. The dirge tempos make it difficult to really find a groove in any of the tunes at all. Siberian Khatru normally gets my whole body moving, but this version nearly made me fall asleep. Steve Howe nearly sounds like he is playing in reverse!   With that being said, let me say that Oliver Wakeman did a PHENOMENAL job getting the sounds and the parts to a nearly perfect shape, albeit without his famous father's flair. Benoit is a good vocalist, but many times he sounds scared to try to hit some notes, and the over-apeing of Anderson's sound gets a little too much. Perhaps he would be better off just sounding like himself and just hitting the notes dead on. I have heard people do Yes tunes and hit the pitches and they sound fine without having to imitate someone. When a band had a singer change, it SHOULD be different, otherwise get the guy who did it in the first place! I get the feeling that perhaps Yes (Squire particularly) just wanted a change, for whatever reason (money, maybe?????) The politics of rock bands are often far more involved then the general public is privvy to.   In any case, I can only say this is pretty much a diehard fan recording. Give it a chance, perhaps, for the sound quality, but those that start with this CD see if you agree about the dragging tempos. Happy listening everyone...

B006O5Y0SS|2.0|Goodness, this is  just Woody Allen' narcissism wrapped up in a feel good quickie for the rest of us. His main character in  this flick is a dead ringer in a dress, manner for the director himself who conjurs up the immortals of early 20th century Paris for his own self-exploitation and nostalgia. Gad, Hemingway hated the Fitzgeralds not because he thought that Zelda was vapid but because he felt  threatened by Scott's talent. Wish that this film had some talent. Boring.

B000056HE9|5.0|1947 was Hollywood's second-greatest year, eclipsed only by 1939. With it's postwar optimism, it gave us GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT and MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, among many others. This 1947 film is a holiday classic. Along with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS CAROL, THE BISHOP'S WIFE is required viewing for the adults at Yuletide. Of the three, THE BISHOP'S WIFE skates (almost literally) closest to the edge of year-round viewability.<br /><br />David Niven is Henry Brougham, the youthful, newly-installed Episcopal Bishop of a large Northeastern city. Loretta Young is his lovely wife Julia. Their marriage is heading down the road that should not be taken. It has nothing to do with love. There's plenty of that, and even passion. But Henry has become consumed by personal doubts. He owes his Bishropic to the machinations of Mrs. George Hamilton an unpleasant, demanding, but extremely wealthy widow who has promised Henry a new cathedral. She has also attached a list of vain \\"ifs\\" to the promise. Henry, who used to pastor at run-down St. Timothy's, is willing to do almost anything to see the new cathedral rise. Knowing that he is in thrall both to Mrs. Hamilton and to his own ego, Henry has become withdrawn, distracted and unhappy, and worst of all, distant to his wife and child.  He prays for divine intercession.<br /><br />Enter Dudley (Cary Grant), a suave, sophisticated, likeable and witty fellow who has a roguish sense of humor. He takes a job as Henry's assistant, but immediately informs the Bishop that he is an angel sent down in answer to his prayers. Henry is very skeptical and asks for proofs.<br /><br />While Henry continues to fret and worry, Dudley begins taking Julia out on the town for walks in the park, to expensive lunches, to stylish couture shops, to visit old friends, and, in a charming scene, to an ice-skating rink. Although Dudley's motives are at first angelic, he soon begins to fall in love with the Bishop's wife.<br /><br />While this forbidden affair of the heart is going on, Henry keeps finding himself in embarrassing situations---locked inside a room, stuck to a newly-varnished chair---and he begins to get angry at Dudley, whom, he rightly suspects, has designs on Julia and is not interested in the new cathedral. His suspicions are confirmed when a friendly cabbie asks Henry if he is the Minister who is going to marry Dudley and Julia, and then, almost in the same scene, a much-changed Mrs. George Hamilton decides to give her millions to the poor.<br /><br />Unlike other great Hollywood Christmas movies, THE BISHOP'S WIFE is a romance that has a very large dose of puckish humor: When crabby Mrs. George Hamilton wants a stained glass window of St. George Slaying The Dragon to \\"suggest\\" her late husband's face, Henry asks \\"And whose face should the dragon suggest?\\" When an old friend of Julia's serves some rather poor sherry from a near-empty bottle, Dudley turns the sherry into top-shelf Shiraz and makes sure that the bottle will never run dry.<br /><br />But like all great Hollywood Christmas movies, THE BISHOP'S WIFE has a simple, direct lesson about motives and motivations and the meaning of life: \\"Let us ask ourselves what He would wish for most. And then, let each put in his share, lovingkindness, warm hearts, and a stretched-out hand of tolerance. All the shinning gifts that make peace on earth.\\"<br /><br />It's a lesson that is as powerful today as it was in 1947.

B006B3975Y|2.0|A funny thing happened about a month or so ago: The Roots and The Black Keys came out with albums around the same time. I liked the Black Keys' album, but hated the Roots'. I was all set to write a scathing review of Undun in which I lamented the downfall of The Roots, noting the unfortunate (for the listener) turn their career has taken, the softness of their music, the lackluster voice and bland flow of Blackthought, the vapidity of their \\"concept,\\" etc. All this changed, briefly, however, upon reading some of the many negative reviews of the Black Keys' album. Much of the criticism of that album came from long time fans who felt that their favorite group had changed too much from their initial philosophy and sound, had allowed too many pop influences into their music, and had basically made a crap album as compared with their old stuff. This sentiment bewildered me because I liked the album, and being new to listening to their music, I felt that these fans had lost perspective on music and life. I respected the opinion of the long-time fan, but really they all sounded whiny and crotchety, letting their expectations and nostalgia cloud their ears from hearing something that seemed to undeniably sound good. Then, looking at the overwhelming positive reviews of the Roots' album, I was struck by how many people, giving Undun 5 stars, claimed never to have heard a Roots album before, or claimed to never have heard of The Roots before they were on that late night show. It struck me that in the case of The Black Keys, I was like the fawning, new Roots fan, who, to me, sounded ignorant. But, in the case of the Roots' album, I was like the long-time Black Keys fan who sounded ridiculous and lacking in perspective. So, I decided to wait before writing this review.<br /><br />First of all, it is unfathomable to me that there are so many people out there who had never heard The Roots before this album, or before Fallon. It's not like The Roots are new, or relatively new, or have only had regional appeal. The first concert I ever went to was when I was 15, in 1994, to see The Roots while they toured for Do You Want More. They've been around for almost 20 years. And, I went to the concert not with my inner-city friends, but with some guys I knew from Ardsley New York (a wealthy suburb). From the beginning, it seemed that The Roots had widespread appeal. By the time I was in college in the late 90's, The Roots were well known to people of all ilk, being played in cd changers throughout campus. I guess what I'm saying is that every single person I've ever met in my entire life (in many countries) knows who The Roots are. They've never been some obscure group. Maybe not everyone bought their albums, but they weren't strictly some underground act. So, to read so many reviews of people who had never heard of them before this album or before Fallon to me is mind-blowing.<br /><br />As far as the music is concerned, all of the things I said in the first paragraph still seem true. I can't totally pretend that I don't know a lot about rap music, but I tried to listen to this album as one might who has never heard The Roots before, or never listens to rap. In doing so, it seemed that, fine, some of the songs had a pleasing-enough sound. I guess if this is the only album by a hip-hop group (more or less) that you have in your collection, then fine, I guess. But, if that is the case, it seems strange to be reviewing the album as though you have any authority on the matter. Not only that, but it seems as if this album, Undun, was made just for you. While some of the album does not absolutely make me vomit, it does when compared to other music that is similar. As much as I tried to keep a completely opened mind while listening to this, I realized that not only was it impossible, but it was unnecessary: people who got this album should know the context. If you don't know anything about rap music than this may come as a shocker to you, but: the \\"concept\\" of Undun is not only not original, but it is the basic premise of 99% of rap music. What is the concept? A kid struggles with falling victim to the streetlife? This is the subject matter of the vast, vast majority of rap music. This isn't a new concept at all. The concept of the album seems makes the content seem distant and slightly sentimental.<br /><br />The beauty of rap music is that it is rugged and direct. Not wistful and theatrical. This album sounds like something that was made not so much to be bumped from car radios, or to dance to at a party, or to sit around and think about, but like something that might be turned into a Broadway play. This is Broadway play rap. If you listen to The Roots albums of the late 90's, you will hear music of the same exact concept, but much more immediate, hard-hitting, and rhythmically complex. I am not begrudging The Roots room for personal or professional growth. I'm not mad at them for not being on the streets, or trying to make money, or whatever. But, to pass off an album as a \\"concept\\" album and have the concept be so trite; to be a bridge to rap music for many newcomers to the genre and have the music be so soft, smooth-jazz-Broadway-play rap, it's just disingenuous. I know that I am a crotchety, nostalgic, old fan, but you have to realize that at one time, The Roots revolutionized what rap music could be. The fact that they made rap music with a live band was mind-blowing. Blackthought was the best emcee ever. He was your favorite rapper's favorite rapper. I am a long time fan and as ridiculous as it sounds, The Roots' music has represented a certain aspect of who I feel myself to be. Over the course of the last few albums, culminating with this cynical effort (as it seems to me as a long-time Roots and rap fan), their music is unrecognizable to me. I won't be interested in their next album.ly not original, but it is the basic premise of 99% of rap music. What is the concept? A kid struggles with falling victim to the streetlife?

B000V4UFZK|5.0|Daughter and granddaughter wanted this-finally found it on here.  Watched it Christmas Eve at their house after leaving ours.  Daughter remembered it from when she was growing up and loved it.
B0068AWQQ2|1.0|I'm not hung up on the fact that remakes should always follow the original movie to a T. But I do believe you shouldn't take too many liberties because you kill the original concept and end up with something like... Fright Night, the remake. Nothing is scary in this movie and lot of it feels completely contrived. And worse, Brewster doesn't even lead into the movie by discovering he has a vampire moving in next door. Evil (his side kick in movie one) tells him without witnessing anything and then becomes snack food right off the bat. Sad, although the effects are pretty good, although lame at times.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|This album has the best 'Blue Christmas' version I've ever heard!  Too bad Christmas is over because this has been my favourite holiday album this season.
B004A8ZWY2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. After seeing it at the theater today I came onto Amazon, as I often do, to add it to my wishlist. I then read the unexcited reviews currently found on the page and thought I should write a review to posit a counter opinion. The other reviews currently posted don't seem to have enjoyed the film, two major criticisms being that they found it melodramatic and heavy handed, comments like these make me wonder if audiences have become so cynical that they view any attempt at displaying open/honest emotion to be an attempt at manipulation. Everyone has differing opinions but I feel this film will appeal to anyone who enjoys stylistically well made films and/or anyone who enjoys stories about bonds/will being tested. In a general sense Spielberg uses the story of this horse to explore the human condition and explore some very well done set pieces/environments.  As I saw it, the horse is a metaphor for hope and how it can be shared and spread, how it can inspire and endure. I don't mean this in an oversentimental way but just in a very real way. We are all hopeful for different things, big and small, and this film is about how under the right conditions and with the right persistence that hope can avoid being snuffed out or lost.   The film, based on a play I have not seen and cannot compare it to, is episodic as the horse goes from owner to owner during the years of World War 1. The fact that the film was episodic didn't make it feel chopped up or give it the feel of a broken narrative. I felt the throughline of the film was the human condition and the travelling horse facilitated the telling of several viewpoints while exploring the excellent recreation of a time period. The acting was top notch by everyone seen on screen. To counter another criticism, the main human character, a boy named Albert, does show strong affection for the horse, a character in the film quips \\"come on now boy, it's not as if he were a dog\\". I didn't find this relationship to be strange, the horse simply becomes very important to Albert because as we see he doesn't have much to his life and the horse is something he gets that then works to make his life better. Perhaps I also never found it strange as I always found the horse to be representative of hope rather than as just some random animal.   The writing in terms of dialogue flowed and felt incredibly natural, as it does in most Spielberg films. John Williams score, while clearly a John Williams score, is the perfect mix of innocence, action/adventure and drama as the story calls for it. I would strongly compare the pacing and acting to Catch Me if You Can, as that film also had several major settings that shifted as the film progressed. I found War Horse to actually be better paced as it has a few more settings (about 5, possibly 6 in total?) and each one is shorter than the ones in the aforementioned film. Best of all the film actually ends when it ends, the story concludes and there are no tacked on or forced endings for the sake of pandering or overexplaining as many recent films have had.  As far as the directing, I don't know if one can compare anything to the seeming effortless magic he created in his early films or certain efforts from the 90's but this would be Spielberg above his recent best and closer to those older films in quality. Everything unfolds visually in such an easy to follow an familiar way while still being unique and involving. There are some masterful shots that recall the opening of Saving Private Ryan but in an artistically different way. This is unquestionably due in part to the fact that this film has been made family friendly, while that could serve as a criticism I didn't find the film to be aimed specifically at families, though it has been made to fascilitate viewing by younger children. Rather than illustrating the pure violence of battle as he did in SPR, Spielberg spends his time in this film showing the brutality of war in a creative fashion that suggests the horror more than displaying it. There is one such scene in particular where mounted soldiers ride into battle and on the other end of the shot their empty horses emerge without many of the riders they once carried.  In a sea of films about special effects, high concept stories or big names here is a film that is a complete film on its own without any gimmicks, as fun as gimmicks can be (Mi4 for example). This film is an actual experience for those who are open to it. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was an excellently crafted film that pushed the dark and grittiness, War Horse is a excellently crafted film that pushes the lighter elements but both are equally enjoyable and excellently made. Watching a good Spielberg film is like watching the epitome of what film is. It's like more recently watching Christopher Nolan's films, there are always flaws in any film but films such as theirs are so carefully and purposefully made as films that they are engaging and fully engrossing.  One potential weakness I will admit, though I feel a reviewing of the film would diminish it, is that the film doesn't have as strong an arc as most films. The characters change but so much of it is internal here. The horse's first owner does change but he is absent through the middle of the film, the various other owners also change in varying ways but all during their own vignettes. The horse itself has changed in much the same way as his owner as suggested by the final shot of the film, but perhaps critical audience members won't pick up on this. That said, one could (and I would say should) view this subtlety as purposeful. The film isn't as much about how the boy or the horse has changed but how despite all they've been through they managed to stay so much the same, they maintain what could easily have been lost.  I dunno, I personally love it (5 Stars) but for objectivity I'll give it 4/5 for general audiences, I think most everyone I described at the beginning of this review will like this film if they view it. For those who feel it is heavy handed and melodramatic go and watch Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, its also an excellent film but there is no overt display of emotion to be found there. Thanks for your time
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This one has a starting skill level so low a six-year-old could figure out how to beat it with minimal instruction. In Chess that's important because learning should be too much labor and frustration... and did I mention that it's free and really pretty to look at?
B00457X7XQ|5.0|The book is written around the growing concern about our excessive reliance on technology. Computers are being used everywhere & we are so heavily dependent on them. In starting, I didn't like it very much as it starts with series of disconnected stories but author magically connects those stories & at that point I got hooked that I read the entire novel in 4-5hours in one go.  the author has got all the technical mumbo-jumbo spot-on which shows the story is well researched. I also liked portrayal of women and the nerdy romance. This really stresses the need for security in a elegant way that no kb article can't & goes to a extend on showing how \\"broken\\"/fragile our current technology really is.   To conclude,  This is a must read if you are a nerd -- you are defiantly knowing to enjoy reading this!
0670022705|5.0|I read about this book in the New York Times and ordered it immediately.  Each of the 100 items included in the book is a remnant of someone's story; the stories are eloquently reported in the book.
0439023513|4.0|After reading other reviews I almost didn't read this book.  So many neagative reviews, I was worried it would ruin the other two books for me (which I really enjoyed).  I am glad I read this book.  No it doesn't have the happily ever after ending but it also isn't nearly as depressing as some of the other reviews have made it out to be.  After reading it, I am not sure I can see another way for this trilogy to end.  A delightful series to read.  I recommend all of them.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Warrior is the best sports movie I've ever seen and not just that but also the best film I've seen all year.<br /><br />The funny part? I hate sports films and never heard of this film up until my friend dragged me into it. Two hours later, we were sitting through the credits in utter silence.<br /><br />It has been years since a film has managed to pull tears out of me.<br /><br />And you know what? This isn't some artsy film that touches a few people... everyone else is raving about it. Look at imdb.com top voted films of 2010-2011, Warrior is currently #5 on the list and over at amazon.com it has a full 5 stars.<br /><br />Stats as of 12/26/11:<br /><br />46 reviewers gave it 5 stars<br />3 reviewers gave it 4 stars<br />2 reviewers gave it 3 stars<br />0 reviewers gave it 2 stars<br />1 reviewer gave it 1 star (either a troll or judgmentally impaired)<br /><br />I've never seen these kind of numbers for any film on the site but fully understand why.<br /><br />A few things that make this film work so well is that it transcends the biggest Achilles heel of sports films... predictability.<br /><br />We always know that this person/team will either win or lose.<br /><br />Here we're in love with the two struggling brothers working their way up the MMA food chain so when the numbers thin, our tension skyrockets... who do we root for???<br /><br />There isn't one main character here... this is the story of two brothers and their father. All of them are looking for redemption. Their stories are unfolded an inch at a time, balanced out with superb action that grabs you in a scissor lock and doesn't let go.<br /><br />Tom Hardy was a rising star I've had my eye on ever since Layer Cake but now he has graduated to one of my favorite actors and cannot wait to see him put the cowl on for the Dark Knight Rises. His performance in Warrior is nothing short of perfect.<br /><br />No one really saw this film in its limited release but it's out on all VODs now so go ahead and see why everyone is buzzing about it.<br /><br />Tell your family and friends about this film because it would be a huge injustice to see it not get any Oscar nominations but these days it's more of a political/money game than a quality game.<br /><br />By the way, Tom Hardy's character on this film is the biggest badass of all time.<br /><br />What are you waiting for? Go watch it!<br /><br />Above review originally posted over on my blog- artofthestory.comot get any Oscar nominations but these days it's more of a political/money game than a quality game.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|According to Wikipedia the Association of Black Women Historians criticized \\"The Help\\" for not exposing sexual harrassment blacks maids were forced to endure. Most women (including my grandmother) in my hometown (Orlando, Florida) were maids and they came to mom's home beauty shop to get their hair fixed and gossip.<br /><br />I remember my grandmother being highly insulted when \\"Miss Ann\\" told her to store her plate with the dog dish...so I can relate to this movie and the fear of violence and economic reprisals which kept colored people quiet for so long. I laughed, cried, and got mad during this movie because it felt like home.

1451627289|5.0|First things first. I've read just about every Stephen King book, anthology, magazine novelette and non-fiction he's ever written since Carrie and 11/22/63 achieves two things that he hasn't managed in a long while, in my opinion at least in a decade or more.  #1: Once I started the book I couldn't put it down  #2: The book's conclusion is satisfying. It's believable, it's heartfelt and unforgettable.  Going in I had my doubts whether a writer, even of King's stature, could pull off what seemed to be another in a long line of first-person time traveling experiences. In fact, my expectation was that it would travel from point A to point B and to point C and that it would end as I expected. The difference in 11/22/63, however, is that the path from each of those points isn't linear. As Jake finds out (and I don't think I'm spoiling anything here), like a guitarist playing a melody, pluck or strike one string it affects those strings around it and the tone of the notes that follow. In other words, the past only allows so much improvisation before it begins to collapse on itself. Additionally, I liked Jake, thought Sadie was a well-developed character and thought the back story believably informed the end result.  (Oh, and kudos to Stephen's son novelist Joe Hill to his dad for encouraging changes to the last few pages of the book. Maybe it's why it works so well).  Whether you're a first or long time King fan, you owe it to yourself to pick this one and read it. I promise (or at least hope) you won't be disappointed.   In sum, I have to echo what the USA Today reviewer wrote when this book first came out. This isn't ordinary King. This is extraordinary King.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I love success stories. I especially love writer success stories, and John Locke has written a real winner. As he told his story, I felt I was there with him. I felt the elation, the satisfaction, and the celebration. What else I loved about this book is that it gives hope to other writers who are not as successful as Locke. He didn't sell those millions of copies on his first book. He was not an overnight success. Years of preparation and thought about how to make a bigger impact with his words are what brought about his success. It left this writer with the feeling that if I just do the footwork, maybe I can be more successful as well.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|I was converting some of my discs to MP3 and recently dusted this one off. This album is basically the Wall Part III. The Wall is a phenomenal album, but (in my opinion) suffers from being (1) depressing and (2) long.  How often to do you listen to a double album straight through (besides perhaps London Calling)? The Final Cut though takes the softness of some parts of The Wall (Two Suns, The Final Cut) and heavy rock parts (Not Now John, Hero's Return) and combines them in a tight package. Ultimately, though, I like this album because I 'feel' it. The best sections of the album are about exposing yourself emotionally - exactly like when The Wall is brought down in that album. It also shares the anti-war theme of The Wall ... but takes that from WW II on into the modern area of atomic weapons (Two Suns). Although The Final Cut appears to have songs from The Wall's 'cutting room floor' and ergo part of the reason for the name, the quality of the songs from this album are are overall better than the wall in their consistency.   I'm not a Floyd 'fan boy' or Roger Waters for that matter. Nor would I ever say this album is better than The Wall.  But, I'll leave you with this...  For every time, I've listened to The Wall in its entirety, I've listened to The Final Cut three times. I'm a middle aged guy - the album reaches me. The Wall is art. The Final Cut is more personal. ... It certainly doesn't reach the drug doing crowd like most other Floyd and Dead albums.  Four tracks not to be missed: The Hero's Return, The Final Cut, Not Now John (only single released from the album), and Two Suns in the Sunset.  Although it was Floyd's lowest selling album since Meddle, it still sold 3 Million copies - no small feat. (Their best album is Dark Side of the Moon)

B006O5XYWG|5.0|I've always been a Planet of the Apes fan.  Actually I really enjoy movies with apes (think Project X, George of the Jungle, etc.)  So as soon as I saw the first trailer for this film, I knew I was going to see it.  In addition to apes, I'm also a fan of James Franco.  I rented this movie from Amazon...free movie credits ROCK!!!  Something you should know about me is that very rarely do I just sit and watch television/a movie.  I'm always doing something else, UNLESS a particular program gets my attention.  Rise of the Planet of the Apes does just this.  It was very interesting from the very first scene.  Lots of action but also tender moments. I thought it was a great story line.  I'm a sucker for animal movies and I'll say I definitely wanted to cry several times, but I didn't because I'm already stuffy from allergies, lol.    That being said, the reason I give the movie a 4.75 is that I really didn't care for the last 15 minutes or so.  Just a bit over the top for me.  But that's just my humble opinion.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I'd watch it again.  And if there's a sequel, I'll watch that too.

0393338827|5.0|I cannot recommend this book enough.  The story is so compelling, and the characters so vivid you sometimes forget that you are reading about actual events with real players.  The story has a way of immersing the reader so much in the buildup of the story that the climax is almost a relief.  This book has a way of informing you on every important aspect of the crisis while still feeling like you're reading a fiction thriller.

B001OQCV6K|5.0|Robert Downey has the perfect quirkiness for this movie.  I loved this one and enjoyed the second one just as much.  Sequels many times have a habit of going astray from the impact of the original, but this time, I was not disappointed.  I am very particular about the movies I watch because of the content, but this one didn't have anything that brought great concern or was offensive.  That's something that's hard to find in action movies these days.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a good game for when you have nothing else to do. games are not too hard and are usually pretty easy
B004HO6I4W|5.0|I watched this movie while visiting family and loved it.  I decided to buy it for my kids.  The colors are impressive, it can hold the interest of kids and adults alike, and the content is not offensive (unlike many movies today).

B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie has action, love, a good story line and some incredible graphics that makes this movie easy to enjoy. This is not the 3D version, and that's ok because I have not found a 3D version that I can enjoy. I wear glasses and none of the 3D glasses I have had access to have worked well enough with my glasses for me to enjoy the 3D movies.   Having said that, Blu-ray has come to the rescue and this edition has been one of the best we have seen. If I said I didn't believe it could get better the movie industry will probably find a way to improve it but on this version I don't see how - It's simply splendid.   One other item that we appreciate is that it does not have all the advertising that comes with so many movies today. We find those bothersome because a month after you have the new movie all the movie trailers that came as advertising are old and out dated. It takes us 10 minutes to fast forward past the advertising and we find that annoying. We like the option of loading directly to the movie and we appreciate that they dropped the advertising and that it loads right to the movie. This also helps make this version a winner.  This Blu-ray edition was a 5 Star choice for our movie library.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|A friend lent me her copy to read. She was telling me this was a great read that her Book Club had read. When I read this book ten years ago.... I remembered it being pretty boring and hard to follow. I did not finish it. Well I decided to give it another try as there is a movie coming out so I gave it another try.... I stuck it out and was glad that I did the second time. The story actually was not that bad but pretty good! So if you find it is really boring in the beginning... hang in there!
B003MC5N28|4.0|When my friend told me about this book I didn't think that I was going to like it. But when I read the whole thing I was surprised that I liked it. I love the way that Lois Lowry wrote the book. I was very pleased with how the story followed Jonas and overall, I liked the book.

B004132HZS|5.0|If you buy this for nothing else, get it for the pilot and the commentary!  I got this for my sister for Christmas and I don't think she's ever thanked me so much for a single present.  Ever.  We watched the pilot almost as soon as she opened it.  BUY IT NOW!!!!!!! XD
B003L77G6K|5.0|I only started watching this series because TBS got the syndication rights.  Once I watched a few episodes I was hooked and bought the first three seasons on Amazon Prime but got a great deal on this Blu-Ray for season 4 so got it.  The cast does a great job portraying their characters and their idiosyncrasies.  Who would have thought they could make a comedy based on science nerds.

B004EPZ034|3.0|I must say I hate when someone is overcritical with kids movies.  In this case though I feel that overcritical is just fair. Kids movies  must have imagination but it needs to be projected in a way that it feels   credible. Some of the plot is not credible and inconsistent, it has some cute moments for sure.   Attitude on the characters well some are adorable (Theodore) and some are just superficial (Britney).   There should always be balanced, right?  About have way through it I began to get desperate, it felt too long, and it was only about 1 1/2 hours.  But at the end the most important this is that my kids liked it. Would they ask to see it again?  probably not.
0307279189|5.0|This best seller is a fantastic piece of writing! Included in the pages are people who do amazing feats bare-footed to boot! Oh those puns!  Also there is a section devoted to running shoes that will help you in selecting the right kind for your own particular needs.....although barefooted running is far superior as is noted in this great book!

B0054JZC6E|1.0|I thought this would be a harmless time waster.  The goal is get enough points to \\"buy\\" the others games.  However, you can also really buy them, for up to $20.  Really?  I would have paid a buck or two to silence the ads that come up full screen after most levels, but it's too easy for the kids to drain your bank account over these trivial games.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Its GREAT to have all of the movies in one and the price could not be beat anywhere!  Having this option and the free shipping, everyone should buy on Amazon.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|when i read the first few chapters of this book i thought it would be a scary thriller book. However once i  read into it even more... i discovered it was a mystery and adventure.  I really enjoyed this book. it is an easy read and i think the age group would be around 9-13.
0307279189|5.0|Great book, very interesting. Switching from medical to the story it is a captivating story about a mans journey to finding a mexican tribe of natives who are known for their running ability.  A must read for runners!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|if u love challenging games this is the best game for u!!  this is one of my favorite games.on.my kindle!
0689835604|4.0|This book has been a favorite of my daughter's from about 12 months to now, when she is 18 months. She really enjoys turning the flaps and finding the items and then showing where the items (belly button etc.) are located on herself, her teddy bear, etc. Good value for money. She sometimes tear off a flap, and that is the only reason I do not give this item 5 stars, but the flaps are pretty easy to tape on again. This book is better than some other lift-the-flap books where it is hard for the infant to see where the flap is.

B003Y8Y9IO|1.0|I'd like to know what's different about this blu-ray edition from the earlier one.  I can't seem to find the run time on it.  I'm desperately looking for the original DVD that I rented through Red Box which had a run time of about 143 minutes.  The current DVD (which I unwittingly bought)and blu-ray offered on Amazon is a later version that is cut to 100 minutes. In my opinion 43 minutes of valuable footage was cut for what I reason I can't fathom.  If this NEW blu-ray version has the complete footage, I'd snap it up.  Does anyone know?

0307477479|3.0|I just couldn't get into this book for some reason... it was too easy to put down and forget about, so by the time I actually did make it to the end, I could barely remember how and if it related to the beginning.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love the soothing music and beautiful backdrops. Challenging at times without being too frustrating. A very good game and a good buy.
B005M4K94G|1.0|I was expecting higher sound levels; did'nt get it...The Venezuelan reviewer who said it was 'muddy,' etc, was absolutely correct.    The 2003, so-called, lite-\\"remastered\\" version is BETTER(!!!) than this.    As far as I'm concerned, \\"they\\" have been playing the ass with putting out a proper, remastered version of 'Caravanserai\\" (and even the die-harder Santana fans would (mostly) agree with me on this...).    So those who are contemplating on getting this current  schuppid version, pass up on it and spend the money to get John Mclaughlin's, \\"To the One,\\" instead...

0446547603|1.0|Contrived story about a BORING, perfect couple. I felt the author thinks his readers are dumb, spelling everything out for them. By chapter 2, I was screaming in my head, \\"Stop over-telling it! I'm not stupid!\\"<br /><br />If he can become a best seller, ANYONE can! This was my first and last N.Sparks book. I was bored to the point of tapping my feet faster and faster against my bed-end for him to finally get to a point... that never seemed to come.<br /><br />I'd actually growl & roll my eyes while reading the perfect and mousy main character. She'd speak to other perfect characters who'd say such perfect things (very unnatural dialogue). Oh, her thoughts were perfect too. What an angel. Ugh! Perfect characters are not only boring but annoying! The guy-hero was so perfect he sounded like an old man (no sexiness in that). Then his kids came on the scene and they were even MORE perfect. The Main C's neighbour was perfect. The hero-guy & neighbour would come out with some perfect philosophy-type sayings in their repetitive speeches to the heroine. Gag. Who speaks like that?<br /><br />I'm all for nice-guy heroes, but not painfully perfect ones.<br /><br />We were told the details of these perfect people's mundane, mind-numbingly boring lives with extreme detail. This wasn't setting up the plot, this was repeating words and phrases in a writing style with so much redundancy I was driven mad by chapter 3. Reading is to escape into a world more exciting more than one's own. Hasn't N.Sparks heard of \\"Tea for the Vicar\\" writing? He also WAY over-uses said-bookisms, adverbs and filter-words. Does he still study the craft of writing or is he resting on his Laurels? This book shouts it's the latter (if his previous books were better. Hard to imagine).<br /><br />A character can still be going through stuff, be sad, scared, etc, and not be DULL. Who wants to read about dull people? I'm so baffled as to the reviews here. SO baffled!<br /><br />There was NO hook. At the end of chapter one, I could've closed the book, happy. I only kept reading through one tedious chapter after the other because I'd paid for it and he's popular for a reason, right? Right? It HAD to get better, it HAD to have a connection between the characters to warrant \\"An epic love story\\" being printed on the front cover! Surely.<br /><br />Sadly, it got even worse. I still hadn't connected with Katie or Alex (her love interest) when the story switched to her abusive husband's POV. Chapter after chapter of the \\"badie.\\" Oh, boy, this book was like a rookie author had penned it. Perfect main characters and a BAD bad guy. 100% bad! And crazy, too. Sparks hits you over the head again and again with the same information (I'm BAD and I'm CRAZY, watch out, heroine!). N.Sparks thinks his readers are just that dumb. He's everything I've heard good authors say what NOT to do.<br /><br />I admit that after chapter 10 I skimmed my way to the end in under 1/2 an hour. I was sick of the lengthy, boring details and conversations. And I'm glad I didn't invest any more time than that, especially given the predictable melodrama infused happenings near the end, and the TERRIBLE actual ending. That's supposed to be a twist?<br /><br />I LAUGHED that a book could be THAT bad and end with something SO contrived and cliche and corny. Laugh or cry, right?<br /><br />This book could have used HALF the words to tell the same story (it's Sleeping With the Enemy without the fun guy as the love interest, and with kids). I'd be embarrassed for anyone to see a N.Sparks novel on my bookshelf, lest they think I was mindless.apter one, I could've closed the book, happy.

B006ANJ4BW|1.0|Terrible movie. Worst movie I've seen in years. Lots of boobs in this film, but the boobie prize is the film itself. Original is a million times better. Conan the Destroyer is a million times better.
B0012BV9FG|5.0|Real quick: I use these as maquettes for my art students. These Schleich dinosaurs are amongst the best available. The quality is very good, and I'll keep buying them as long as I teach. If you want something better, you'll have to make it yourself, or pay several hundred or thousands of dollars to have something made for you.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|Exhilarating- we had seen it 3x already before purchasing, but decided to purchase it still. One of the most vividly colorful films ever.  Great fun for the whole family.  Caution:  a little language that I think inappropriate for children under 10

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|It began well.  It ends well.  For fans of the series, this movie wraps up everything nicely.  Sure, the epilogue is a little weird, but it's what we all expected, and it couldn't possibly have included different actors.  Great in blu ray of course.

B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Alright, so perhaps I'm a wee bit too old to watch a movie like Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules.  I'm 30 years old.  Oh well.  For a fun and innocent teenage comedy, it's totally worth watching.  It's about a young man in 7th grade who has two problems.  One, he has a major crush on a beautiful blonde-haired girl and he wants to get her attention any way he can, and two, he gets picked on by his older brother *constantly* and frequently seeks out to try and get along with him (and their parents have the exact same desire).  Well the problem is, every time the boy tries to impress the girl, his older brother does something to humiliate him, which then usually shifts into an embarrassing adventure (for example, in one scene the older brother manages to get his younger bro to walk through a hotel in his underwear and threatens to spill the beans concerning this news to the blonde-haired girl at the end of the hallway involving a video tape that recorded this little mishap).  The best segment however, is the one where the parents force the two brothers to get along while the parents are out of town, and the parents are hoping spending much needed time together will finally make their relationship better, but... the brothers go against their parents wishes and throw a party at home, haha.  This turns out to be a pretty popular chunk of the storytelling- this one huge party, which translates into the two boys trying desperately to keep the news hidden from their parents and clean up the after effects of the party before the parents make a surprise phone call and announce they're coming home early.  A lot of funny things happen at this party, though.  Also some of the 7th graders friends are hilarious too, especially the one who unintentionally sits on a spiked ball!  What I find extremely bizarre is that the older brother looks EXACTLY like a young Mick Jagger!  Seriously, check out Mick Jagger from circa-1963.  You'll see a facial similarity!  Also, the father (played by Steve Zahn) looks exactly like an old friend of mine from 11th grade environmental science class who used to make funny/scary faces whenever I entered the room, lol.  Good memories.  Overall, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is most certainly a family movie, or more specifically, a movie for kids in between the ages of 5-15.  It's really funny though, and I wasn't expecting this at all.  I recommend it.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|she and him holidays did not disappoint!  Love their new take on holiday favorites with their own style and voice.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Aside from the rather facile and sentimental ending, Malick's latest film is quite strong and ambitious though it will inevitably draw comparisons to Kubrick's &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey.&#34; Malick must have been aware of this, but pushed ahead with the project anyway, confident that he had something new to say about the evolution of life and human consciousness. I'm not sure informed people will learn anything with Malick's depiction of an evolving cosmos, but the visuals certainly have a profoundly emotional effect that is missing from books that take a scientific approach to these matters (e.g. Sagan, Gould, Dawkins, Dennett, et. al.). Malick also doesn't offer any theories about the connection between a cold and unforgiving and chaotic universe (or perhaps multiverse) and the raw emotional impact of losing a child. Like &#34;The Book of Job&#34; from which Malick seems to draw inspiration, beauty, if it is to be found at all in this veil of tears, can only come in the form of art and poetry. The author of Job (wisely) provides no answers for human suffering; he gives us instead his magnificent verse as consolation. So, too, Malick cannot tell us why we suffer and what our anguish ultimately means; he can only give us a very gorgeous film to watch and study and discuss. I think the movie is a very strong one indeed; but Malick does seem to slip into &#34;Capra Corn&#34; at the end when we see the dearly departed walking hand in hand on a beach in what is meant to be some sort of quasi-supernatural, &#34;heavenly&#34; world. So, who knows, maybe Malick is a more traditional believer than he makes it seem in the earlier, zen-like segments of his movie. Or maybe, like many educated Americans, Malick cannot simply ignore eastern mysticism and so gives us a hybrid of eastern/western spirituality. Overall, an enormously satisfying experience and probably the best film of the year.
B004MPESSY|3.0|First of all Jeff Branson total hunk gorgeous guy in so many ways. Stupid main character although beautiful and the bad guys were sadistic and out there which of course is a duh for this movie. After a girl is left for dead after being raped abused etccc she comes back for revenge against her tormentors and rapists.  Horribly depressing movie and I could not take the violence talk about gag inducing ugh.   Couldnt get through the whole thing and I LOVE horror movies my stomach just cant handle certain kinds of violence thats the problem.   It was interesting suspenseful and intense in certain parts but overall this movie was too slow it took forever for something to happen and when it finally did it didnt matter anymore. The main character did a great job as did the villains but in the end ultimately the victim became just as bad as the villains which in turn left no one too root for.Granted I wanted her to get revenge but WTF she went overboard understandable but still she was just as bad as the villains and I liked her at first.

B002ZG976U|3.0|I love musicals and have seen almost every one ever produced both on stage and in film. Watching 'Burlesque' is like watching the TV show 'Glee'. You know that Glee is unrealistic, overdone, and absurd, but , hey, they got these great musical numbers that you would never never see in a real high school show choir. So you watch it anyway because you like the music and you ignore the idiocy of some of the more ridiculous plot lines. However, with Glee, the plot lines are interesting and make sense even if they are overwrought and often unrealistic. They are interesting and Glee at least deals with real and important issues. The same cannot be said for Burlesque.   If you are familiar with burlesque as an art form, be prepared to see a version of burlesque that never existed in real life. Not even close. Strip out the comedy, the sexual banter, the skits, and the music and what you have left is numerous numbers of dancing prancing women (and sometimes men) in skimpy costumes behaving like the backup troupe for a Cher concert on an ever expanding and contracting stage in a totally imaginary burlesque theater backed up by a full orchestra.  This is a burlesque theater that you will only see in an ex-burlesque's queen vision of heaven. It is more of a cabaret than a burlesque theater.   One of the main plot points of this theater owned by Cher is that it is broke and Cher will lose the place in a couple of weeks to the bank.  You can easily understand why Cher is broke if you think about how much it must have cost to equip the stage, make the costumes and put on the show.  Cher has a couple of numbers that she does very well, but you need to get beyond the death mask of a face that she displays that was probably caused by too much plastic surgery and botox.   Christina Aquilera is excellent. She sings, she dances, she takes over the film because she can really act. You just have to ignore the stereotypical line that she is just a girl from Iowa. Really?   Don't think toohard about the absurdity of the various plot lines that surround the musical numbers. They are dumb and laughable and will ruin the fantasy of this imaginary burlesque theater. For example, much is made of the fact that all the women lip-sync to the music until Aquilera comes along who can really really sing. She belts out the songs and very soon after ALL the performers seem to have magically taking singing lessons.  Then you will laugh yourself silly as you realize that the entire film is lip-synced, all the songs are done in a recording studio and added to the film.   Normally this film would deserve a 1-star rating, but I really like musical theater, and despite the terrible nature of this film, I had to give it 3 stars.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|What to say? This is the best Disney DVD ever. It's Magic. Just plain MAGIC. There are two discs. One of the movie. Another of special features. If you have never seen this Walt Disney masterpiece, it is a supreme treat. If you have, then you know. Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Ed Wynn, David Tomlinson, Elsa Lanchester. INSPIRED. METICULOUS. ENTERTAINING. It's the tale of a special Nanny and a chimney sweep named Bert in London, England in the year 1910. Something about her elicits wonderful things, and she and her cohorts create marvelous film fun and fantasy the likes of which you'll never forget. Lively dance animation, too. Vivid colours. Great music. Unbelievable special effects. Do you like Dancing Penguins? I do. You'll think you are a kid still. Richard Sherman and his brother composed the memorable film music. On Disc Two they take a wistful look back at the production in 1964. Both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke reveal their nostalgic, candid experiences of movie making on the Disney set. And Wow! Enjoy the electricity of the 1964 footage of the Gala World Premiere! (missing, by the way, in the more current DVD release). This is a GEM, A CROWN JEWEL OF THE DISNEY VAULT. Watching both discs brought tears of joy to my eyes and surely it will bring broad smiles to yours. Winner of FIVE ACADEMY AWARDS: BEST ACTRESS, FILM EDITING, MUSIC SCORE, MUSIC SONG \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee,\\" and SPECIAL VISUAL EFFECTS. A timeless tale about love and laughter created by the genius of Mr. Walt Disney.
B006671NPM|1.0|When will the Studios learn to stop trying to screw their customers!  I had preordered this movie in October, I received it last month and learned about the idiotic attempt to control their users that is Ultraviolet, and steal their choice of formats.  luckily I hadn't opened it yet, and have since returned it to Amazon.   I will never again buy anything associated with Ultraviolet, I already use iTunes, its simple, and it works! WB stop your stupidity or you will just drive everyone to download movies, and you will lose!  Amazon you need to learn to stand up for your customers like Apple does, and stop supporting the studios stupid ideas.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|I really enjoyed this beautiful collection of Bee Gees songs. I'm a mega Bee Gees long time fan so I may be a bit bias. I admit a few of my personal favorites like \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and \\"Fanny\\" were left out and I already own most of the hits from other collections but, I like that each Gibb or their surviving family member picked their favorite songs. I love the idea and the size is very compact for easy storage if your a pack rat like me. I most enjoyed Robin's CD and Andy's CD. Especially Andy's unreleased \\"Arrow through the heart\\". It was so touching and sad to hear Andy's last song and read the 60 page bio booklet with personal stories from family and friends ,also the rare family photos are lovely. I think the collection was nicely put together. Andy's daughter Peta added her thoughts which I love and she picked all my favorite Andy songs most were from his first album \\"Flowing Rivers\\" which has a country music style to it. With the tragic untimely loss of Maurice and Andy and now Robin sick and I'm praying he will be well soon, I will treasure the collection even more. The Bee Gees are perhaps one of the most talented bands ever, right next to the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix in my book. God Bless you all and God speed Robin. I love you Robin ,Barry ,Andy, and Maurice, thank you for all the love and comfort your music gives to my life, Bee Gees Forever!!!

0765357151|4.0|After watching the Will Smith blockbuster THEN reading the book, I was very surprised at how very different they were; feeling they're almost two seperate stories. I was also surprised that the book was actually a collection of short stories by Matheson; all of which were good. However, this review focus' on the title of the book and story, `I Am Legend'.<br /><br />This story follows Robert Neville, the last man on Earth, as he struggles to survive in a world taken over by a vampiric plague, which he appears to be immune to. You're immediately thrown into the current existence of Neville. It's in his flashbacks that we learn of his past where you can't help but feel his pain and root him on as we follow his attempts at survival and destruction of the undead. By day, he scours the city for food and supplies but spends most of his time repairing his house and carving stakes. By night, as the vampires call out to him and try to break into his house, he struggles with lonliness and sexual frustration. Even with his drink of choice and classical music he blares every night to drown out the vampires isn't enough to keep the depression at bay. However, along the way, he begins to conduct his own investigation to understand and maybe even cure the plague. Neville is by no means a scientist but with the library as his aid, he is able to perform scientific experiments which sheds light on logical causes of the worldwide epidemic.<br /><br />Although, different from the movie, I still enjoyed the book just as much. Going back to old school vampires straight from vampire myths: garlic, stakes, mirrors, sunlight etc... sets this story apart from modern day vampire novels. I was immediately drawn in, so engrossed in the story; anxious to find out what happens next! Wrapping it up and tieing it with a bow, it has an ending you won't see coming. I definately recommend this book especially to those who enjoy science fiction, horror and classic vampires. Do you dare join him on this journey?

038542471X|4.0|For me personally, the book was a little hard to get into at first. But of course, that's probably just because of my broken reading tendencies because as the story unfolded, I got more and more hooked on the story; \\"on the edge of my seat\\", anxious to find out what would happen next!<br /><br />Mark Sway is a kid you can't help but admire and fall in love with. At 11 years old, he is experiencing something NO child should ever be face with. Yet, he's determined to protect his family at all costs, proving to be wiser than his years.<br /><br />Reggie Love is a feisty lawyer who helps kids (who she refers to as clients) overlooked or abused by the system. She definitely goes above and beyond her call of duty when it comes to her little clients. When danger arose after meeting Mark Sway she would do anything to protect him; even if that meant putting her own life in the hands of an 11 year old boy with a crazy plan...<br /><br />Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this book. The book, although law-related, is easy to read because of Grisham's writing style. It contains a great story with unique characters and unbelievable suspense. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good suspense, thriller. I also recommend the movie if you haven't already seen it!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This review although my own, contains some rephrasing of the original blurb written by the author. Specifically, the character descriptions.
0545091020|5.0|This book was a total surpise !This was not my typical kind of reading-but an enjoyable find.Very entertaining.  I was totally engrossed. Could not stop listening- At times I could feel my own heart racing.Wonderful imagination and unforgetable characters.Some parts were sad and touching, while others made you \\"feel\\" the fear, frustration and human need to survive..I can see how it could be made into a movie-but it must be read first- Like most movies-it is impossible to capture-a must read or as I did listen to the audiio! A great reader...
0553213105|5.0|I was first turned on to the book, `Pride and Prejudice', when I picked up a copy of `Wuthering Heights' at my local book store. On the inside cover it suggested not to miss `Pride and Prejudice' and `Romeo & Juilet'. So of course, I bought them as well!<br /><br />When I first started reading the book, being that it was written in 1813 and the language being slightly different then, I found the book a little hard to get into. Although, once I got to know the characters and the story began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down (literally). The romance, as well as the relationship, between Elizabeth Bennet & Mr. Darcy was highly intriguing and only added to the chemistry that makes this love story truly amazing! Now, I don't want to give away any of the juiciness that lies within the book so I won't say anymore. You'll really just have to read the book!<br /><br />NOTE: While browsing around, it appears that other authors have written books continuing the `Pride and Prejudice' story regarding the lives and love of Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth Bennet. So that might be worth looking into for those who've already read and fell in love with, `Pride and Prejudice'!
140053271X|2.0|I like this device,  but the software is flaky.  With 2 months of light use, after numerous lock/hang issues, mine is a brick and cannot be be rebooted.  B&N has offered a REFURB unit as a warranty replacement - underwhelming for such a new and obviously flawed device.  My experience is not unique, many have had similar issues.  It should not be that hard to deliver a bulletproof eReader, it has very limited function, not like a general purpose computer running code from various vendors.  Application code/device driver stack is not strong.  Hardware appears to be reasonable.  Would be interesting to see a report from someone that knows specifics about the software shop that developed the Nook Simple Touch code.  The UI is learnable in a relatively short time,  but not intuitive as an eReader should be.  The eReader UI experience should be closer to an iPhone experience, instead of a VCR timer event recording from the 80's (like it is).  Recommendation to B&N, get different software development team with experience writing bulletproof production code for 2.0.  Full rewrite of Nook Simple Touch code recommended.

0439023521|1.0|This book reads like a stupid-child version of Koushun Takami's 1999 book \\"Battle Royale\\". Battle Royale was a fantastic book and I'm pretty upset that an American woman had to steal it and make it into a retarded Twilight-esque love-battle. Get your own material, lady.

B003O86FMW|3.0|Catching Fire picks up right where Hunger Games left off. Unrest in the Districts is growing at an alarming pace and Katniss unwittingly finds herself the figurehead for the movement against the Capitol. The characters you loved return for the sequel and the reader must endure each indignity the Capitol inflicts upon them. It is painful, tortuous, imaginative and motivating. It is everything The Hunger Games was and more. It both answers your lingering questions and creates so many new ones. It challenges you to think and creates such feelings of empathy for the characters that whenever I had to put the book down, I was genuinely worried for leaving the characters hanging and couldn't wait to pick it back up just so they could continue fighting for their lives and freedoms.
B005HP2J66|5.0|I found this movie to be so worthwhile. I live in SW France near cave paintings at Pech Merle in France. These paintings are far more exquisite and far older. Herzog examines their significance from many points of view: visual art, paleontology, archaeology, history, sociology, etc. The various experts whom he interviews add many dimensions to undertanding their importance. If you are headed to the South of France on vacation and might be visiting any painted caves, watch this CD before you go. Excellent prep.
0553801473|1.0|I say that because this book is just Feast of Crows the Second. It's very clear that this author has no interest in writing this series any longer; the plot fumbles for about 100 pages and then I gave up altogether. I do not know if this was ghost written, but it certainly shows that the author will just keep reusing plots for money. Shame on me for buying it without having first read the sample.

0439813786|5.0|My wife and I took precious time out from setting up our new businesses to see the film Hugo.  It's that rare thing, a perfect film.  It also has heart and I left the cinema crying with joy, knowing that it is OK for me to fix things, to make them work for people.<br /><br />Not surprisingly I bought the book and my wife and I read it together.  It is also astonishingly good with great drawings that create sequences between sections of text.  The book and the film differ in character treatment, plot and development because the film is Martin Scorsese's vision of the story, but the love of the book is clearly in the film.<br /><br />If you have read the book, see the film.  If you have seen the film, read the book.  I guarantee you'll be happy either way round.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I endorse this movie to be taught in every secondary school across the country. In the past three years, we have witnessed and felt the sting of a struggling economy as a result of greed produced by those in power of high office. The great depression of the thirties is a similar type of depression that has sprung about in modern day culture. Even though only the wealthy could afford to pay 250.00 for a sack of flour or sugar back during such dreadful times, today, we find those who were supposed to be making a living aren't truly living today. Either, due to jobs being lost because a greedy economy has squeezed out the middle class to fall at the bottom of the totem pole to stand in line with the very poor at the community food pantry, or at the umemployment office seeking help or some sort of relief in order to maintain until they are back on their feet.    The Grapes of Wrath is a reminder of humble means. You work hard for the wages earned. You sacrificed what you had on modest means. Today, we can't live happily on $45,000 a year to maintain our homes and feed our family of four, because our priorties are misplaced, because our expectation of standard of living far exceed what is practical within reason.  We're often reaching for more than what can reasonably afford. We don't save as much, because we're often driven to spend what we don't have.   That being said, I believe this movie teaches us how to be thankful and content when it comes to making the almighty dollar.  It reminds us that sticking together through the bad and the worst of times is truly what is defined as being the idea family. And for what it's worth, that when we come into contact with any money, be it earned or obtained as a gift, that we can be led by the examples portrayed through The Grapes of Wrath before we spend, that we will take caution and use wisdom that will cost us nothing, but will gain wise counsel to prosperity in the end.

1878424939|1.0|This is one of the most inaccurate, pessimistic views of our existence. Please, help yourselves, do not follow this book. It/the author feeds on your inner fears by first acknowledging them, then offering another path... there is a better way. I invite the author to email me. To dialgue about \\"freedom\\" and to find a path that will free him from himself, and his self-imposed limitations. I promise, every person reading this book, that your past, present and future is more than than this book encapsulates. Sorry if I sound overly frustrated but I just received this for Christmas, was reading it last night, and was shocked. For example, \\"we are on an eternal search for the truth because we only believe in the lies that we have stored in our minds.\\" The entire book is like this. I know several people will have some harsh criticism for this review, I can tell there are impassioned people out there for this book however, I really felt compelled to write this.
0062060554|2.0|Without divulging the plot I would like to understand why so many people thought this was a good book? I think the book is tedious and boring but continued to read out of curiosity.  It is rare that I don't agree with reviews when there are so many good ones however I am stumped this time.
B00005JM8V|1.0|As the son of a member of the Polish underground whose unit Zoska was recognized for saving 350 Jews during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising I would like to say that the emotions of my father and myself, after watching the parts of the movie involving Poles, were that of disgust and anger.  This part seemed to us to be patently manipulated to shamelessly further an anti-Polish agenda.  I remember how, as people who speak Polish, and are familiar with the realities of WW II occupied Poland, we felt, as we watched this movie, how the questions posed to the apparently poor, uneducated and unsophisticated Polish villagers were leading, contained double meanings, and/or were taken out of context, and were intended to elicit specific responses.  To boot, we perceived the tone of the translator to be aggressive, rude, manipulative, patronizing, hostile, accusatory and demeaning, while the villagers were clearly being polite, non confrontational, agreeable, welcoming, and basically human to strangers who were to them unlikely visitors to their remote and obscure village. The loss in translation of the subtle nuances of tone, use of specific words, etc. appeared to me and my father to have been deliberately exploited by the director to foster an unflattering image of all Poles.  This, alas, is not something that would be apparent to the non-Polish speaking viewer.  The choice of interviewees, the losses in translation, the omission of Polish suffering as well as the failure to mention positive behavior of Polish Catholics towards Jews, coupled with alleged false facts (I personally do not remember the false claim reported by others to have been allegedly made in the movie that the Polish underground refused to provide arms to the Jewish ghetto), the non-Polish viewer is thereby unsuspectingly left with an unmistakably negative but false and unfair impression of the role and culpability of Poles in the persecution of Jews by the German Nazis.    In summary, I found this work to be insidiously and dangerously misleading, in line with communist propaganda, which in the past sought to undermine any support for a free Poland by encouraging a negative opinion of Poles and Poland.  This movie was, in fact, made and released, while Poland was still on its knees under Soviet control, and in my view, is the moral equivalent of a kick to a person laying unconsciously and helplessly on the ground after an unprovoked severe beating.  I personally believe that Lanzmann's \\"Shoah\\", is unworthy of the subject matter, and needs to be vigorously challenged in the name of common decency, the truth, and most importantly, the memory of the millions of Poles who were killed, forced into slave labor, deported, evicted from their land, tortured, maimed, terrorized and starved during the brutal and inhuman occupation of Poland by Germany in the name of \\"Deutschland, Deutschland Uber Alles\\" and \\"Lebensraum\\" for Germans, the memory which he, Lanzmann, sweepingly maligns.  This movie is insensitive to a nation that did much to defy German Nazism, at extreme cost, from the beginning of WW II until the end.   The subject matter of this movie itself is indeed of monumental importance and interest as it, in and of it self, is extremely sobering, thought provoking, and shocking.  This has little to do with Claude Lanzmann, however.  Any documentary on this subject created in a minimally competent fashion would no doubt elicit the same extreme emotions.  When judging this movie and the contributions of the director, one should assess whether the movie took full advantage of the material, and for what.  I believe the material WAS taken advantage of, but to divide, to gratuitously judge and to shamelessly claim the moral high ground, without having earned the right to do so.  I have such strong feelings on this movie that I would loathe watching it again, even though I can watch other movies on WW II and German crimes against humanity.   PS  I did read that Mr. Lanzmann, in regards to questions on the anti Polish bias in the movie, allegedly stated that had he known what he has since learned about Polish WW II history, he would have done the parts on Poland differently.  If this is true, then the parts of the movie regarding Poland SHOULD BE redone, plain and simple.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the same Klondike Solitaire that most of us have played for years. You can easily change the settings for variations. Plays really well on my Kindle Fire. Highly recommend for someone that wants a simple game to pass some time.
B00650SSWG|2.0|Honestly, this movie was not that great at all.  The cinematography was good, but not much beyond that.  Aside from being absolutely predictable, it didn't move me in the least.  I found it hard to sympathize or root for any of the characters, which is sad because it was not as though one was opposing the other, so ideally I should have been rooting for them as a couple.  Their inexcusable immaturity and poor decisions made it difficult for me to feel bad for them.    Also, I know the little bit about Dylan's father (and mother) was supposed to be heart-wrenching and compelling, and it really was not.  I couldn't help rolling my eyes because it was obviously put in there by the writer(s) to make Dylan less 1-dimensional--so we could see where he's coming from.  Honestly, I couldn't see past the beachfront view and his job at GQ.  All I got from this movie was that (1) \\"my life is not perfect\\": rich, attractive people have problems too--duh and (2) sex is never just sex--even if it starts off not meaning anything, it'll always means more.  Now, I'm really being generous as far as saying that's what I got from the movie when really I should say that that's what the movie attempted to convey in more time than it really needed to.  All in all, this movie fell so very flat for me--as flat as J.T.'s acting.  Make it stop!

B000FA5TTW|5.0|This story at once invokes feelings of despair and hope... it embodies contradiction. The main character, Susie, is murdered in the first chapter. What unfolds is a tale of looking back and yearning for life while learning what life is about.<br /><br />Susie is the perfect narrator for this tale. She is young enough to not become bitter. This is not a story of revenge. This is not a tale of total loss. The reader is rewarded for their faith and reminded that justice will be dealt in due time.<br /><br />As for the story, I found the resolution between Ray and Susie to be almost unrealistic... granted that the reader must suspend reality for the rest of the story. However, if that were possible then why didn't the story work out differently?  This dissatisfaction with a single element (though it was truly a beautiful scene)is not enough to sway my opinion that this story could be a game changer for a lot of people. I came away with a different perspective, as I am sure other readers will do as well.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|This case is the BEST.  I purchased 4 different ones to try out, and this one is my favorite.  The cases that allow you to create a \\"stand\\" are a waste.  They only make it bulky, and you can just as easy get the same effect with this case.  Such a classy look this case has.  Very nicely made.  Actually, this was a lot nicer than I even expected.  Yes, the straps are snug, but they are NOT difficult to get the Kindle into.  You are paying $200 for a tablet, wouldn't you want the case to be snug?  5 stars isn't enough accreditation.

When she turned on her Thrive for the first time, there were several apps displayed on the desktop and in a split-second, she said \\"Drawing Pad!\\". Though she'd never used the app before, she knew it meant she could draw and create on her new tablet. She drew some great pictures Christmas Day which we've saved to SD.<br /><br />The app is intuitive and should be easy enough for younger children to enjoy while giving older kids a cool tool for expressing their creativity.<br /><br />The user can choose what medium they would like to work with (crayon, colored pencil, paint, markers, stampers, stickers) and then can select from a myriad of sizes (such as brush sizes for the paint) and plenty of color selections (don't forget to scroll the screen for all the colors)! If you want to use a combination, just click the house at the top of the palette! My daughter really enjoyed that she could use crayons and paint brushes within the same drawing. Another feature she likes is that she can select different backgrounds (color of \\"paper\\") to work on.<br /><br />If you're looking for a \\"coloring book\\" in which you can open pictures for kids to \\"color\\", this is not the app for you. If you have a child that loves to draw, create and stretch their imagination, this is the app for you!<br /><br />Another great feature is the choice of erasers. You can choose from a small pencil eraser to correct a little portion of the drawing, or larger erasers or the crumpled piece of paper to clear the whole thing and start over.<br /><br />Whether you get the app for $.99 or $1.99, it's worth it if you have a child that loves to draw! Looking forward to our next road trip when the backseat won't be filled with crayons, pencils and paper.or $1.99, it's worth it if you have a child that loves to draw!

0385535139|3.0|The book was quick-paced, but unfortunately it was not a memorable writing.  Except fot the blogger and his 'tif with David Zinc..It was not Grisham's best but  enjoyable nonetheless.
B003UESJDI|5.0|This is a  wonderful film by director Stephan Frears, well-paced, well-scripted, well-acted and non-predictable. The movie avoids cliches, builds characters and has them follow their destinies in a charming, humorous and sometimes revealingly gritty story line, bravo!
B004EPYZTE|4.0|I loved the movie, full of action from the very beginning.  The one big thing that bothered me is I got the Blue Ray/DVD/Digital copy only to find out that the digital copy was only valid for iTunes and I have an android device.  Not once was this mentioned in the description so I paid for it but cant use it unless I purchase an iPod.  I really hate the way more and more studios are including digital copies of things and make it close to impossible for you to actually use them.

B004M9ZI0M|3.0|As has been done innumerable times with Shakey's writings the director and script writer choose to strive for either a classically traditional and faithful rendering, or completely contemporary interpretation or, woe to my poor mind, a blend of both. Adaptations I can live with, but trying to patch an article of such disparate elements which vacillates from moment to moment between the two distant worlds of 17th century England and 21st century America made me feel a little too queasy. Stir into the cooking pot acting that also vacillated between the aforementioned cultures and it was a quick trip to the bathroom.   Having survived that I will say that the interpretation had it's creative moments especially with the, although overdone, CGI effects as well as the body art, props and costumes. The Hawaiian island geography helped to sustain this viewer's interest through what seemed to be, at times, overboard rambling acting and at other times just bland, memorize the lines, acting. Overall, to the production crew's defense, they did well for a limited budget and a strange menu mix. Unfortunately, more forgettable than memorable.

0131480057|4.0|This books tackles quite a bit of territory with surprisingly comprehensive coverage.  I bought it for its coverage of rpcsec_gss which is much better than any other book I could find.  This is my go-to book right now for setting up NFS with rpcsec, Kerberos, LDAP, and quotas.    NFS is a vast issue.  I know you can do a package install on (favorite distro) and hope for the best.  But setting it up correctly is actually a pretty big task.  I found myself using this book again and again to get a big picture summary.  I took one star away because the author got a bit preachy on rquotad.  Paraphrasing, he considers it obsolete and not worth the effort.  I have no idea what the intention behind that statement is.  Are quotas obsolete?  Is just rquotad obsolete?  Eh.  I'd love to here the reasoning behind the decision that quotas weren't worth the ink.  Otherwise, very nice book.

1451627289|5.0|I must admit that I am a sucker for time-travel stories, so going into this book I was already conditioned to like it a bit for that reason.  There are so many other reasons why I was genuinely blown away by 11/22/63.  Stephen King not only takes us back (1st to 1958) in time, he has created a beautiful love story between characters and to a different time in our history.  This is an adventure story, a thriller, a drama, and a romance with a sci-fi twist with the best and most intense 400 page climax I have ever read.  If you are a fan of LOST, The Shawshank Redemption, or The Green Mile, you will love this one.    My wife and I are avid readers of all kinds of books.  Sometimes you get into a slump where you are reading a few books in a row that are good but not great.  11/22/63 was such a wonderful read that we have been recharged!  (Side Note: My kindle stopped working shortly after finishing the book.  I called AMAZON and they are sending a replacement because it is in warranty.  The process was so quick and simple that AMAZON now has a kindle customer for a very long time.  SPECTACULAR customer support!!!)
B006FTCH2E|5.0|\\"Another Earth\\" is not at all what it seems.  I was expecting a science fiction story of one kind of another.  Not at all.  This is a story about a woman who commits an inexcusable, if understandable, mistake which ruins and ends several lives.  Rhoda Williams is celebrating, with a few glasses of champagne, her acceptance to MIT and a future in astrophysics.  Distracted by the discovery and visibility of a new planet in the solar system, driving home she is the cause of a terrible traffic accident which kills the family of a famous musician.  Her life as she knew it is over, and his, of course, is destroyed.  More would be telling, (other reviews here go through the whole story, but I shall not) but this story is about the futility of anger, the power of forgiveness, and of course the precious nature of life and the importance of being willing to start over again.  I was at first disappointed in this film, having expected a science fiction flick, but slowly it captured me until I realized that I was in the grip of an unusually powerful and unforgettable story about redemption.<br /><br />This was a low budget film along the lines of \\"Blair Witch\\" and similar genre.  No matter.  No flashy special effects detract from the inexorable storyline of this superb film.  Impossibly beautiful Brit Marling successfully carries off the role of a down-and-out woman who has ruined her life and those of others and knows it.  This is a short film of 93 minutes that has not a single wasted scene.  The ending will puzzle and delight.  Few will fail to be touched by this one.  Highly recommended.  RJB.

B0026IUXO2|4.0|Queen Elizabeth, sometimes known as \\"Good Queen Bess\\" was a towering figure in English history.  She presided over the transformation of Britain (England, really) from a poor backward country into perhaps the richest nation in the world.  As an American less familiar with English history than my British cousins, I cannot speak to the various historical inaccuracies that other reviewers have noted here.  But this film is a lavish spectacle that acquaints the viewer with the early portion of Elizabeth's reign and rule.  The central theme is her deft manipulation of stronger nations in favor of England by her tactic of dangling the possibility of a royal marriage in front of them.  This film gives the viewer a feel for what Elizabeth might have been like, and her political attitudes including her disdain for religious strife, i.e. Catholic versus Protestant.  Elizabeth's attitude towards marriage is summed up in the film by her icy announcement that she was \\"married to England.\\"  And so she was.<br /><br />This is an engrossing and enjoyable film.  For the American viewer who is doubtless less familiar with English history, it serves as a fine and entertaining introduction to Queen Elizabeth.  Recommended.  RJB.
B000002JSP|5.0|\\"In Through The Outdoor\\"  (1979)  #1.<br />Recorded at Abba's Polar Studios in Sweden, Led Zeppelin recorded what I think is their 3rd best album.  \\"In Through The Out Door\\", gets slammed a lot in the press, but it could be their best album since 1973.  The album starts off with one of their most beautiful rockers \\"In The Evening\\", the strutting \\"South Bound Saurez\\", the funky steel drums of John Bonham on the top 20 hit \\"Fool In The Rain\\".  The Bakersfield sound of \\"Hot Dog\\", loved this from the get go, Jimmy Page at his most most fun loving.  The synth driven  \\"Carouselambra\\", not my favorite, but it has it's moments.  Their first single off the album was the mellow rocker \\"All My Love\\"#75, the sound Robert Plant would adopt on his future solo records.  And the album closes with the modern blues of \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\", Jimmy Page plays some cool guitar here.  They went out on tour in early 1980 in Europe, but never made it to the States, because John Bonham died of alcohol poisoning on September 25th.  Led Zeppelin disbanded in December of 1980.  This band released  seven wonderful studio albums and only one clunker, just a great band anyway you look at it.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|In a similar vein to his earlier film Sideways, Alexander Payne's The Descendants is a film about people coping. The difference here is that in this film they are coping with the unacceptable and irresolvable. Based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and adapted by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, The Descendants deals with the problems of a man discovering that his wife, who is now in a coma from which she will not recover, was unfaithful to him, with all of the ripple effects that something like that can create.<br /><br />Matt King (George Clooney) is a lawyer living on the island of Kaua'i in Hawaii. His wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is in a hospital where she lies in a coma resulting from a recent boating accident, and now Matt - who refers to himself as \\"the back-up parent\\" is suddenly thrust into the role of being the only parent to his two daughters, 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley) and 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller), both of whom are exhibiting behavioral problems. To make matters worse, Matt is told that his wife is for all intents and purposes brain dead and will not recover and, in accordance with her wishes in her living will, must soon be taken off life support. And if that was not enough pressure to be under, Matt happens to be the sole trustee of a land trust worth hundreds of millions of dollars that he must soon make a decision on regarding its break-up and disposition, a decision of enormous interest to dozens of relatives who stand to benefit enormously from the sale of the land.<br /><br />As Matt begins to let Elizabeth's friends and family know of her impending death, he learns from Alex that Elizabeth was having an affair with another man. Which leaves Matt having to deal with feelings of anger, betrayal, and confusion, with no way to resolve them because the person he needs to resolve them with is in a coma from which she will never recover.<br /><br />Clooney does a deft turn as Matt, making him comical in the situations where he is clearly out of his depth and yet sympathetic as a man having to deal with anger and hurt seeking answers where there may not in fact be any. Shailene Woodley is outstanding, turning in a bravura performance as Alex who is caught in between:  in between her mother and her father when she discovers her mother's affair, in between her mother and her younger sister whom she tries to protect from the truth, in between her father and her boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause) a genial slacker who unfortunately has the habit of saying clueless things that make people want to punch him in the face, and most of all, in between still being a child and being forced to be an adult by the situation they are all now in. Matthew Lillard's Brian Speer, the real estate agent whom Elizabeth was having an affair with, is an interesting casting choice, putting a likeable character actor in an unsympathetic role. Lillard gives Speer just the right touch, a guy who isn't truly villainous, just foolish. Which is part of the problem for Matt. There are no real villains in the situation, no matter how much he and Alex and Elizabeth's blunt bull-headed father (Robert Forster) want there to be. There are only people who make unfortunate choices, the consequences of which are left to others to deal with.<br /><br />The Hawaiian setting is interesting in how it's presented, not showing just the usual idyllic version most people have of Hawaii as an island paradise but the current day side of things where rampant development has made much of it just like anywhere else, visually reinforcing a point Matt makes in the film's opening narration:<br /><br />\\"My friends think that just because we live in Hawaii, we live in paradise. We're all just out here sipping Mai Tai's, shaking our hips and catching waves. Are they insane? Do they think we're immune to life? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up? Our heartaches, less painful? Our cancers less deadly? ... Paradise? Paradise can go f[***] itself.\\"<br /><br />Note: fair warning to parents. There's a lot of profanity in this movie and about half of it comes from the two girls, Alex and Scottie.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the performances and for not submitting to the usual easy Hollywood resolution.to parents. There's a lot of profanity in this movie and about half of it comes from the two girls, Alex and Scottie.

B0038P59A0|4.0|I really wanted to love this film, and there are many elements of it that are very likable - the fact it's Guy Ritchie, the presence of a cast of excellent actors and a plot that is as sophisticated as any Conan Doyle story, whilst being refreshingly different.<br /><br />I wanted to love it, but somehow it doesn't quite press all the buttons.<br /><br />What I will say of it is, although it starts off a jumbled mess, the villain and the plot gradually deliver a very enjoyable film. It's almost like watching a good B-movie, in that there is a lot there to satisfy the mind, but somehow all the interesting pieces do not come together as a symphony.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, it could be put down to the choice of lead actors. Although the extras make much of the chemistry between the two, somehow Robert Downey's mumbling portrayal of Holmes and Jude Law's ordinary performance of Watson don't quite cut the mustard.<br />In fact, the supporting cast of Rachel Mcadams (as Holmes' love interest), Hans Matheson (as Home Secretary) but most of all Mark Strong (as Lord Blackwood) outshine the two leads and make you wish that their performances had made for a classic film.<br /><br />Maybe the film would have worked if [[ASIN:B004132HZS Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[ASIN:B000JBWWP6 David Tennant]] or a myriad of other actors had been the leads (answers on a postcard, please).<br /><br />As it is, though it has many things right, it doesn't quite work. That said, having viewed it twice, there is enough in the plot and some of the performances to warrant repeat viewings...<br /><br />P.S. On a side note, if you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, and wants something different and new, do give this a go: [[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]

0307593312|2.0|What just happened?  Haruki Murakami is my favourite author, but I feel cheated having just finished this nonsense of a book. I want the last few weeks of my life back!. I started out in good spirit, thinking that I was liking the book, and assuming that questions would be answered as the book progressed. Instead, as the book progressed, the questions just kept building and building, until the book collapsed completely under their weight.  There are so many things wrong with this book, it would take a 1Q84 length essay to chronicle them...  A few:  Who the hell was the taxi driver telling Aaomame about the two worlds right at the get-go? What happened to the Professor? There are so so  many things left unanswered, it is staggering: Fuko-Eri just disappears; we never find out why Tengo has the memory of a man sucking his mother's breasts, nor if she died as described, nor who his father was, nor why his \\"father\\" claimed Tengo was \\"no one\\", nor why Tengo at 18 months, can retain this memory when he was actually asleep, nor what happened to the crew Buzzcut sends after them at the end; nor, nor, nor...   The time Tengo spends with his comatose father could have been dealt with in a dozen pages, instead of 120. The nurses served hardly any purpose whatsoever. His father's \\"dhota\\" or whatever the hell it was  appearing at the doors of two of the characters for looooonnnggggg passages, served no purpose whatsoever, and was never explained (beyond his tapping on the bedpost).  The obsession with breasts is just embarrassing.  The \\"love\\" between Aaomame and Tengo that survived 20 years, despite having their only having one interaction as ten-year-olds, was ludicrous. As was their \\"reunion\\" - they share maybe 100 words in their first two ours together, four of which are \\"you've got great legs\\" - really?  I could go on and on and on, and was planning to, but I really can't be bothered. I was SO looking forward to this book, and I am staggered that it was published in this clearly unedited form. A lot of blame has been laid at Knopf's door - but it should properly be blamed on the Japanese publisher. Murakami is a demi-god in Japan, and I imagine the editors didn't dare question him. He needs better advisors around him. But the bottom line is that the blame should be carried by Haruki Murakami himself: this is simply a poor book - a massive conceit. There are passages that are close to his best efforts, the scene with leader especially (but even that is spoiled by Aaomame's failure to see that he is not a \\"bad\\" man), but there is SO much filler, waffle, repetition, confusion, repetition, nonsense, repetition, fluff, and lack of focus (and repetition) that they hardly matter.  It could have been a good book (the plot was never there for a great book) if 600 pages had been taken out, and 100 pages had been added to answer questions and tie up loose ends, of which there are dozens.  I hope he reads the Times review...  I am still his biggest fan. I just don't know what happened here - it's quite bizarre. Having suffered through Mark Helprin's 700pp \\"Winter's Tale\\" (great first half, unbearable second half), I am going to turn to shorter novels for a while - hopefully Haruki will do the same...

B000WCDI64|5.0|The interviews and background provide a fascinating picture of a young lady who was under-estimated by some, but not all, of the people in her life. She was from a humble and simple family who appeared to be surprised by her talent and success. It almost seems that some people were indifferent to her rare talent and could have been, probably not by intent but by omission, using her. There appeared to be no one looking out for her best interests. At times, some of the people around her appeared to be amused and entertained by her intoxicated and addled condition.  It's a very sad and tragic but not uncommon story of intense God given talent bestowed upon a lovely but quite ordinary child - where...when the full measure and weight of that talent is realized - the person is so awed by their own power, they are compelled to run from it.
B005KJZDXK|3.0|Zooey Deschanel has pleasant, honest voice that sounds simply charming - much like her singing in \\"Elf.\\"  The solo tracks are easy on the ear and not over-produced.  Unfortunately, the \\"Him\\" (M. Ward) portion of the duets is weak and uninspired.  This weakness is most evident on \\"Baby, it's cold outside.\\" Zooey deserves a much stronger singing partner, like Leon Redbone.  [The mixed nominative/objective case title is nonsensical, but memorable.]
B006O3MU96|3.0|The game plays like the original, in fact I hardly noticed any differences. If you have the original, the Christmas level is almost the exact same idea reskinned. There are minor, subtle changes to the background. Obviously I wasn't expecting a drastic change to the already extremely fun, addictive Doodle Jump formula, but if the developers are going to make it it's own game for the same price as the original they have to make some decent changes or improvements. Unless you want to make the senseless mistake of purchasing a &quot;game&quot; for the same price as the original, which might I add also has multiple levels, save your money or buy the original Doodle Jump.

B000P1QMZ6|5.0|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Special Widescreen Edition) is the first movie in the Harry Potter series. Here we get to meet Harry, a boy who lives with his mothers sister. One day he gets invited to Hogwarts, which is a school for wizards and the adventure begins. We get to meet characters such as Hagrid, Nearly Headless Nick and many many more. I love the music and the special effects. Daniel Radcliffe is superb in the role as Harry. I also like the parts played by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. A very well made adaption of the book. I liked it a lot. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B006P4H7OW|5.0|I am an avid fan of anything that scares the pants off of me and finally they have created a show that is not just full of gratuitous violence, blood and gore (which I do enjoy also). This show creeps you out, keeps you guessing and makes you afraid to look behind you. I love it!!
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|When I order cds that  are also available in a \\"deluxe\\" editions, I will usually listen to the samples of the bonus songs, to see if it's worth the extra few dollars spent for them. Most times it is, and with Daughtry's third album, not only is this true, but these 4 songs may just be my favorites on the album. I suggest anyone who is buying Break The Spell, go ahead and get the Deluxe version because the song Lullaby (a beautiful song obviously written for Daughtry's twins) alone is worth the extra 2 bucks.<br />Daughtry has been a favorite band of mine since their debut album and it doesn't look like I will be changing my mind about this anytime soon. Since the day I received my cd, I have kept it in my car's cd player and listened to it continuously for weeks. I just cannot get enough.<br />Standout songs for me are the aforementioned LULLABY, CRAWLING BACK TO YOU, CRAZY, GONE TOO SOON, MAYBE WE'RE ALREADY GONE and RESCUE ME. As the title of my review states, there really isn't a bad song on the album. As with their previous 2 efforts, Chris Daughtry and band show no signs of hitting a roadblock on their trail of success.
0525423281|5.0|Seventeen year old Lola Nolan is in love with twenty-two year old rock god Max. And nothing can shake that. Not of her disapproving parents who force Sunday brunch upon her and Max. Not her best friend who thinks she could do way better than a rock wanna be. But those things don't matter to Lola. No one is going to stand in between her and her guy.  That is until Cricket Bell shows up next door. Cricket Bell the same boy who, two years earlier, made her heart flutter and break in one short summer. The boy she swore would never mean anything to her again.  But something's changed. Cricket isn't only taller, he's startlingly better looking, and seemingly interested in her. With mixed up feelings, and new emotions bubbling up inside her Lola's definitely in love - but with who?  Lola and the Boy Next Door written by author Stephanie Perkins is a straight up romance novel full of whimsical fun, laughs, and of course love. Far from fluffy, Perkins second novel conquers facing the ups and downs of first love.  Perkins writing is flawless. Full of the wit and humor, her words not only make for a memorable story, but breathes life into her characters. Lola, especially, is unforgettable. From her many over the top wigs to funky I don't give a damn style, Lola is the kind of person every girl wants to be friends with, and every guy wants to date.  Lola and the Boy Next Door is a read for everyone, from fashionista to punk rock princesses. And best of all (at least to me) is that it features Marie Antoinette, or at least a Marie Antoinette costume!

0307474275|4.0|I'll not get into the details of the plot to avoid spoilers.<br />Regardless on where you stand on these issues religiously, this is a masterfully written novel. Sure, it may not be historically accurate... but who cares? This is not supposed to be history. It's fiction, and it's really good at it. The plot grips you at the beginning and never lets you go. The characters are not that well developed but the storyline is so good that it doesn't matter so much. Great work!

B001GCUO5M|5.0|Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, Shutter Island works well as a claustrophobic experience, mystery, and physiological thriller. Scorsese does a superb job of creating an unsettling, Gothic mood, with a music score that adds tension and effective, creepy imagery of the island. There's a deliberate slow moving pace to the film, but I think this works well to build tension and lead up to the dramatic conclusion. Some may guess the ending, or at least have clues where it is heading before it reaches the film's final minutes, but, nonetheless Shutter Island is a great film, a successful, stellar adaptation of the novel. The cast particularly shines, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who turns in an excellent performance, giving depth to his role as Teddy Daniels. Ben Kingsley also does a superb job as the institution's Dr. Cawley.     Teddy Daniels arrives to Shutter Island with his partner to unravel the mysterious disappearance of one of its patients, Rachel Solando. As Teddy and Chuck explore the institution, and find out about Rachel and its inmates. However, Teddy learns more about the mystery and the institution, flashbacks and visions begin to surface that further complicate the plot.   Shutter Island begins with one mystery only to add on another mystery that needs to be accounted for. There are several layers of twists, but these are revealed in fragmented pieces that we put together.   As far as editions to the film, I'd stick with the blu-ray over this edition, as the blu-ray has two featurettes about the film: Behind the Shutters and Into the Lighthouse. The quality is a bit sharper as well.   Over all, Shutter Island is quite an effective, atmospheric experience and, as one reviewer noted, a film that you can view multiple time to pick up clues and meanings. Creepy and weird, but in a good way. Definitely one of Scorsese's best.   4 1/2 stars

I mean, this game isn't all that graphically intensive, gameloft got asphalt 6 and shadow guardian to run way better than this, and they are far more visually complicated.

I've been disappointed to find features missing in some Office software I've used before--the lack of support for certain foreign languages in my first copy of DocsToGo (to be fair that's no longer an issue) or the inability to save documents to subfolders in (of all things) MS Office on Windows Mobile. Office Suite Pro seems to keep surprising me in a good way.

B000B8QG4A|5.0|Years ago, while studying abroad, I went to see the German language version of this Disney classic.  The English word \\"Lady\\" is not unknown to Germans (who were as enamored of \\"Lady Di\\" as anyone else), but for reasons known best to themselves no doubt, they changed the film's name to SUSI UND STROLCH.  Now I admit I had to look up \\"Strolch,\\" but sure enough it is one of the German words for \\"tramp.\\"  I figured the \\"Susi\\" was selected for alliterative reasons.<br /><br />Makes sense, I suppose, but it seemed a little odd that the name \\"LADY\\" was written on the German \\"Susi's\\"  bed.  What are you gonna do?<br /><br />There was no alliteration in the original English language title, of course, but it was a clever play on the song \\"The Lady Is A Tramp,\\" a tune which had been around for some 20 years before the Disney film debuted in '55.  That would've been a sop to the adults in the audience of course.  No eight year old would pick up on that reference all that readily.<br /><br />It's not just the title though.  I often hear adults say that LADY AND THE TRAMP is one of their favorite (if not their very favorite) Disney classic.  Despite the fact that its main characters are anthropomorphic canines, the film is, at its core, a sweet love story.  Kids get it, to be sure, but adults just eat it up with a spoon (or no utensils at all if they're imitating the spaghetti scene).<br /><br />And how many children's movies feature sophisticated, sultry numbers like \\"He's A Tramp,\\" written and sung by the sultry, sophisticated Miss Peggy Lee.  Her stand-in in the movie, is the worldly, wise-cracking Pekinese (some say Lhasa Apso) Peg, who serves as \\"bad girl/bad dog\\" foil to the demure Cocker spaniel Lady.<br /><br />As in classic cinematic love stories of yore, star crossed lovers--one of whom is definitely from the wrong side of the tracks--are misunderstood and seemingly undercut at every turn.  Somehow true love and pure hearts win the the day, overcoming packs of vicious dogs, diabolical rats, crazy aunts, viciously cruel Siamese cats and undercooked pasta (not sure about that last one).  And then there's that nightmare vision of a dog pound.  You wonder where the PETA people came from?  They all saw LADY AND THE TRAMP as kids.<br /><br />I'm sure that some clever Ph.D. candidate of cinema or popular culture studies has already written a dissertation on \\"The Theme of Personal Freedom vs. Domesticity in Disney's LADY AND THE TRAMP.\\"  Thing is, they wouldn't be so far off.  Some of the classic themes of American cinema really do crop up in this Disney animated classic, including class tensions rugged individualism, and, yeah, the lure of adventure and freedom vs. the comforts of hearth and home.  In many ways, this is probably THE most American of the Disney classics of the mid-20th century.  It is not just another updated re-telling of an old European fairy tale.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app!  There are so many features including radar and an hourly forecast and the layout is great.
0894803123|5.0|This was a no-brainer purchase. Huge B&J fans at our house, buying a new ice cream maker, so what other cookbook to buy than Ben & Jerry's? So far we've only made Ben's Chocolate but we have a line-up of recipes to try next. They all use the same base recipes, & just vary the flavorings & add-ins, so no way can they go wrong. Easy to follow, few ingredients--perfect for us.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|this game is grreat but it keeps on giving me theses adds like you have 3 virises or your new iphone four is ready!
B005HSL626|4.0|Just got the kindle fire, also uploaded this game. Problems? It crashed three times the frist time i played it. The ads aren't too bad, that's probably what crashed it.Ill try it with no wiring laterand see how it works. Otherwise no reason not to &quot;buy&quot;.
0439023491|4.0|If \\"Survivor\\" were scripted, and lethal, it would look like this series.  Who, but an idiot, would think that allies are real, when only one person can survive a competition?  Collins created compelling characters who you are rooting for, and clear bad guys.  The story is gruesome, and if you expect any subtleties whatsoever, you will be very disappointed.<br />This is a great book to take on a plane, or for pure escapism.<br />I gather is you are looking at reviews for this novel, that you have read the first book in this trilogy, so I didn't go into any details.  Much of book one is repeated.  But if you like this genre, you'll enjoy this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun. it is simple yet keeps your interest going with the new levels and games to beat as you go, I would recommend this game for anyone to playbut you do need some patience to figure things out
0062014102|1.0|I got this book to read up on David Bohm's theory of a holographic universe. For the first seventy pages or so Talbot does a good job of covering this as well as Karl Pribram's theories of psychiatry. But then Talbot starts moving toward his real subject, the validation of every kind of psychic mumbo-jumbo by using Bohm's theories. He starts with placebos and phantom limb syndrome, moves to multiple personality disorders and before you know it, he is pushing psychokinesis, telepathy,stigmata, \\"the light\\", precognition...and on and on. He accepts the 18th century Jansenist miracle cures and convulsionaires in France as bedrock fact without detailing the other more likely explanations, while making it sound as if the affected numbered in the hundreds rather than a few dozen. He cites plenty of sources for his \\"data,\\" but is also given to incredible leaps of logic. Speaking of miracle cures studied by a Dr. Rex Gardner, Talbot says \\"Although Gardner does not try to account for this or any of the other healings he discusses in his article, PK (psyhcokinesis) seems a likely explanation.\\" Really?<br /><br />If you're into New Age mysticism there will be little new here for you beyond Talbot's linking these phenomena to Bohm's theory. If you're looking for a lay explanation of quantum physics, this is not the book for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really fun game of you have pansy's haha the game is fun just get it people haha
1589946901|4.0|This is a really fun 1-4 player team management game, but it's VERY different then the Blood Bowl board game.  You don't play on the tactical level, you play strategically week-to-week over a season.<br /><br />Very fun, and plays in 30-45 mins w/ 3-4 players.
0060873027|1.0|not a book I could really get into. Similar to a book i read a few years ago. Great concept, but poor execution with Preston. Pirate Latitudes was much better. Halfway through you really want to stop reading, but I finish what I start. Sad this will be Crichton's last book, as he deserved better. I've read everything else he's written and will remember him that way.
0385738765|5.0|My son is 14 and loves this book.  He would definitely recommend reading the whole series.It will keep you up at night!
B006NXIO7O|4.0|The film is anything but slow or dragging.  it is edited in a sparse fast paced sequence.  It is its strength and weakness.  The strength is the film moves along from action sequence to action sequence with Saldana in almost every sequence.  The young Catalaya is awesome as well... The weakness, it is not a believable film because it is edited for the ride not for the story.  However, if you want a fun, stimulating film with a strong female hero that is seeking to eliminate a small portion of the evil heartbeat in humanity, this should be your cup of tea.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|Taylor Swift at her finest. I got this for my daughter and she is thrilled! She could not have been happier. Thank you Taylor Swift!
B0063IH60K|4.0|As solitaire games go this is quite good.  The full screen ads can be a little challenging to figure out which way to dismiss as some dismiss differently than others. This does not detract from the game play once past the ads.
B0006HC0I2|5.0|As Truffaut stated, this is really more a film about friendship and aging than about gangsters.<br /><br />Jean Gabin is brilliant as Max, the elegant, dignified underworld leader who is growing tired,<br />and wants to retire quietly off his last score.  This is a film that lives in the brilliant human<br />details. We never see the big heist itself - it's already over when the film starts.  But we do see<br />Gabin brushing his teeth, looking at the bags under his eyes in the mirror, etc.<br /><br />Now it's all about finding a way to close the books on a career, and still protect his best friend<br />and colleague, who becomes a target when other mobsters want to get their hands on the take.<br /><br />The story itself could be called thin, but Becker fills it with so many telling human moments and<br />details that I was touched and involved.<br /><br />Yes, there were a few places where the plot, logic, or motivation holes bugged me just a touch.<br />However, I suspect I'll warm to this even further on a eagerly anticipated second viewing.<br /><br />Criterion do their usual superior job with the transfer.
0143142364|5.0|It was a great book, loved every minute of it.  I watched Pillers of the Earth and couldn't wait to hear this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i didn't know it was an audio book til i downloaded it. it is great for the kids and me i take it to church to use cause it is easier to navigate than fliping back in forth with an actual bible.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Exactly what it is.  Nice balance, nice knife.  I don't particularly care for the nylon snap on the sheath buy it is functional.  Would be nice with a leather (made in America) sheath.
B0055SWM08|4.0|game has a calming, serene effect. game play is sometimes hard to figure out, but overall design is very elegant.
B000286S8S|5.0|I love Van halen. This album picked up where \\"Best Of: Vol. 1\\" left off. This is the best of Van Halen and Van Hagar. There are three new songs \\"Up For Breakfast,\\" \\"It's About Time,\\" and \\"Learning To See\\" are all good hard rocking Van Hagar songs. They sound like leftovers from the \\"Balance\\" record. Then we have all the singles released by both the Sammy and Dave era. I love the fact that they included \\"Finish What Ya Started,\\" \\"Feels Soo Good,\\" \\"Black and Blue,\\" \\"I'll Wait,\\" \\"Runaround,\\" \\"Hot For Teacher,\\" \\"Everybody Wants Some!!\\" and \\"(OH) Pretty Woman.\\" These are some of my favorite songs, and I'm glad that they showcased them on this album, because they are great songs. They actually put songs on here that should've been on the \\"Best Of Vol. 1\\" album. However, I do have to shed light on the disappointing parts of this album. For one, I don't think it was necessary to put live versions of \\"Panama,\\" \\"Jump,\\" and \\"Ain't Talkin''Bout Love\\" sung by Sammy Hagar when the original versions were all ready on the album. It's just redundant. What they should've done was add more tracks off the \\"Balance\\" album like \\"Amsterdam,\\" \\"Deja Vu,\\" \\"Feelin',\\" \\"Seventh Seal,\\" or \\"Aftershock.\\" I was also disappointed that none of the new recordings from \\"Best Of Vol. 1\\" were included on here as well. \\"Humans Being,\\" \\"Can't Get This Stuff No More,\\" and \\"Me Wise Magic\\" are all great tracks. They also could've added some more D.L.R. tracks like \\"So This Is Love,\\" \\"Take Your Whiskey Home,\\" \\"Mean Street,\\" \\"D.O.A.,\\" \\"Somebody Get Me A Doctor\\" and \\"Atomic Punk.\\" I know most Van Halen fans would criticize me for this but I think it's only fair that they should've added tracks from \\"Van Halen III\\" which featured Gary Cherone on vocals. There were some good tracks on there that most fans don't want to recognize. \\"Fire In The Hole,\\" \\"Without You,\\" \\"Ballet Or The Bullet,\\" \\"Dirty Water Dog,\\" and \\"Once\\" should have been given some attention. In all I'm happy that they finally included a lot of theirlesser known hits but they could've added a lot more to this album. Still if you're a diehard Van Halen fan you must get this album!
B003UMW68Y|5.0|One of the most iconic films of all time in 2 versions at a great price. What more can be said? Pure eyecandy!
B005LFQRTC|4.0|The only thing missing is the ABC Movie-of-the-Week lead-in for the first few \\"movies.\\"  But then, like NBC's Mystery Movie lead-ins for \\"Columbo\\" & \\"Banacek\\" ...I understand it is a \\"rights-thing.\\"  What a time capsule; a vessel, actually, to my teens.  The supplements are great, too.  Although personally, I felt that the \\"Bigfoot\\" episodes were the series's \\"jump-the-shark\\" moment.  The supplements seemed to include the shows in their nostalgia for the \\"good years.\\"  No matter, a wonderful trip into my past.
B006AN78XS|4.0|This was a fantasy come to life for the main character, Gil. The idea is that we have all thought of a time as being better than the present, and to be transported back would be a dream come true, to live as you would have, not the way society makes you. It was a fun, satisfying comedy, Woody Allen comedy, so not laugh out loud, but appreciative none the less. Marion Cotillard shines as the understated, beautiful muse of Picasso, you cannot help but fall in love with her. She is the epitome of Paris. Owen Wilson was his normal quirky self with wild dreams and was great throughout the film. I cannot imagine as a writer how fantastic it would be to be among some of the greatest writers/artist in history that set the scale, so to speak. At the mention of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dali, Matisse and T.S. Eliot, he would absolutely light up and i think this draws you in as the audience, even if you are not familiar with some of these people. I cant comment on the accuracy, but i really dont care about it either b/c it was just a movie that was not meant to be a biography, just a fun film. It's very typical Woody Allen, so if you don't care for quirky, outside of the box, it may not be your cup of tea, but for me, it made me smile. If you had a bad day or ready a dreary book or watched a tough movie, this is a good follow up!

B0029QRA1U|5.0|The ion profile pro usb turntable is exactly what a turntable needs to be.  Now that computers can easily hold 2gb files, an uncompressed 24 bit 192khz audio stream is achievable without overloading the computer.  This turntable is not for listening to records! The idea is that you download and install audacity, and use it to record the record as it plays through usb.  When it's done you use the noise removal function to do just that, along with normalize to bring the volume up acceptably. You then effectively have a digital copy of the vinyl, which you could even put on your ipod if you wanted to.  So the end result is that you get a better quality playback out of the digital copy because you've removed the noise and turntable rumble.  Because I've tested this to actually work, I quite like the product.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|The Amazon version is several revisions behind the one in the Android Market. Did the developer abandon Amazon because it was offered free? and you can't upgrade using the Android Market version.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This is an awesome collection of Holmes stories with an active Table of Contents.<br /><br />Earlier I had thought the second part of Study in Scarlet was replaced by the Book of Mormon, but upon further reading I discovered that this second part really is about Mormons. Go figure!
B005ZUR724|5.0|You would think that because it is a mobile platform it would be inferior to the PC, but it can compete quite well. and for 99 cents it is a must-try.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is the perfect gift for the Harry Potter fanatic.  The quality of the films are great, and the DVD quality is superior.  The price could not be beat and delivery was fast.  Overall, my experience is quite favorable and would return again and again.  Thank you
B0055SWM08|5.0|very fun game with a relaxing twist. you won't be able to put it down with it's simplistic but addictive game play

B006O5XYWG|5.0|At last a scifi that is well written; well acted and has really great cinematography! Well done! This was enjoyed by everyone in our family from 5 to 62.
B005HSL626|1.0|:  This app keeps stalling and going back to my home screen.  I hope this issue can get fixed.  My kids love this game.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|The movie is a great christmas classic. I enjoyed this movie as a kid and now my wife and I purchased it for our son to watch during christmas as he grows up. We love it. Purchasing through Amazon was quick, easy, and the delivery was fast. Great experience.
0439023521|5.0|There's not much to dislike about this gripping, dare I say fun?, novel reflecting on the logical end to reality television. Although the characters still seem slightly wooden even after a grueling experience, the rest of the book is a horrifying and entertaining treat. Couldn't put it down!
B0063GORYU|5.0|fun, fun game. works great on my kindle fire. no issues I've found. also plays perfectly on my android phone.
1419702238|5.0|Great Book!  It was delivered as promised just in time for my son's birthday!  He spent the whole weekend reading it, and finished in time to do a book report for school!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just enough levels. Fun. Cool. Addictive. I love this app. The best thing about it is that its FREE. No good apps are free. But this one is.....
B0041T52S6|4.0|If you are thinking about viewing this film, imagine if Richard and Danny Elfman's expressionistic film \\"Forbidden Zone\\" (1980) was effectively blended with \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\"(2003), \\"Malice In Wonderland\\" (2009), and \\"Sky High\\" (2005). If you liked any or all of those three films you should enjoy \\"Scott Pilgrim vs The World\\". American audiences have historically been highly resistant to expressionism and it is interesting how that style is now finding an audience in the gamer and comic book crowds, apparently computer generated special effects have effectively kicked down the barriers that have long kept us trapped in the realism style.    I came to this film as a fan of Alison Pill and was not disappointed, she appears to be having a lot of fun playing a variation of Mary Stuart Masterson's \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" (1987) character; although Alison gets to deadpan much funnier lines.  And Mary Elizabeth Winstead should get some credit for putting herself out there in some unconventional stuff like this and Tarantino's \\"Death Proof\\" (2007). It is rare for an actress to take these kind of chances but it is a good way to avoid type casting.  My only complaint is that much of the $60Million budget does not seem to make it to the screen, the film would probably have worked better as a more minimalist production.  The computer generated stuff simply has no charm and you just want to fast forward through the silly fight sequences.   Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|If you like sharp witty crime stories with a hint of a possible romance this is for you. The beauty of this is all the characters are well selected and  theres a great balance between them all. The murder plots keep you thinking with some of them being quite dramatic. But be warned, once you watch the Season 1 you will have to buy Season 2 and 3.Enjoy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very relaxing and fun puzzle game.  the music is very soothing and I definitely replay it over and over again.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|very good program for a quick game while waiting for that flight or doctor's visit. I would like to be able to play random players or friends over the net. Not sure if this Jean option if itisit isnot very clear.
0385534639|5.0|This book was amazing, but over much too soon.  I want to go back to the circus again and again.  Erin Morgenstern wrote a magnificent debut novel with fully realized characters and an evolving setting in ever changing locales.  Superb!

B006JPS1OM|4.0|good game can be tough to touch hidden objects good storyline nice graphics needs work on selecting objects colors are sharp
B004SGWYVA|5.0|This is, as far as I'm concerned, THE PERFECT EMBODIMENT OF \\"THE ANIME ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE MOVIE\\" FOR ALL TIME.  ***FOR ALL TIME!!***  I'm surprised that this hasn't been done sooner.  It was a bloody blast of a time watching this series.  I can't wait 'til the OVA and Season 2 comes out on Blu-ray Disc.  And if I had the resources, I would collect all the doujinshi out there as well.  A GOOD TIME GUARANTEED! ^_^
B005LF9IO8|1.0|Kudos to the people that were in charge of selling this movie. I was expecting much more. The story was hugely dissapointing. Save your money and time and watch anything else.   The first 8 minutes were the best part of the movie and the music woke me up during some of the slower scenes.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|At the very end of this book, Stephen King talks about \\"Time After Time\\", which ran through my head as I read his new novel. I have always felt that \\"TaT\\" was a classic, which dealt with time travel in a way that both felt right but was also handled in such a way that it didn't take away from the heart of the story. And, I can say that I feel the same way about 11/22/63. While it does have the sci fi element to it, and some violence and other horror, at its core, this is a love story, and a wonderful one at that. The details of the passing days as the clock ticked inexorably toward the climax were truly amazing. Stepping away from the book, I had to remind myself it was 2011. Stephen King has found a way through his prose to bring the Old, New world to life in a truly fun and captivating way. Bravo!
B005HSG3TC|3.0|For the price, this cover should be something innovative like the Smart Cover is for the iPad 2.  On its own, this item is decent - but based on what you get, the price point should be $12-15.
B003Y5H5AQ|1.0|Love the movie - both the adults and the kids in my family - which is why we bought it for Christmas, including the digital download to watch on the iPad. But the code in the box isn't recognized which means I can't download the movie I paid for. RIP OFF. Just go to iTunes when you want a movie.
B0064BCNA4|3.0|The response time on a kindle is just too slow.  I could see where it would be fun to fool around with which is why I gave it 3 stars.
0385535139|3.0|I was torn. I tend to read technical books so the opportunity to take a break to read something \\"light\\" is needed at points. I have read most of Grisham's novels and have generally enjoyed most. So when I came to The Litigators my expectations were not high. I was just looking for something to get lost in. The plot doesn't move too quick. In fact, sometimes it feels like it meanders along. Is it just me or is Grisham stuck on mass tort law? Anyways... character development was adequate, maybe a bit more since the plot doesn't really move that fast. Of course, there is a climactic part at the end that made the investment of time reading the past  two days worth it.   In the end, I think Grisham has a style. If you like the style,  you won't be disappointed. If you are expecting him to branch out and write something completely different, you will be sorely disappointed.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|I think it's impossible to dislike this movie. In addition to being laugh-out-loud funny, this movie is incredibly sweet and heart-warming. I highly recommend it, if for no other reason than to see the squid-gun and the minions. :)
B005N95JA4|5.0|An amazing re-issue by the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band. The previously unreleased Music should have been released as a Double LP in 1978 on the original Some Girls Album. It is like listening to a brand new Stones LP. Excellent music by the Glimmer Twins.
B0051T46XM|4.0|I first saw Trollhunter with my brother in the theaters and immediately knew I would be getting it for my dad as a gift. This movie starts off a bit slow, building up the story line and characters, but once the hunting begins it is really a fun and entertaining movie.  I recommend it for any sci-fi fan...or if you are just looking for something a little different!
B004A8ZX2I|5.0|Another great Liam Neeson movie & as usual the best price was on Amazon. Looking for good DVDs; stick with Amazon it is cheaper and faster than driving to the XX-mart stores.

B004U52VPS|4.0|Overall, glad I purchased this for my little guy...  5 Stars...off the computer, and actually doing something, and thinking 3 dimensionally.  4 stars...little guy (4.5 years old) really likes it, we've played every day so far.  3 stars...a little hard to play...the 'precision' and weight of birds makes actually knocking the structure you build down in the posted number of hits is a little tricky...  5 stars...great for a younger child learning to \\"read\\" the cards, and then build the structure according to direction...I believe this has some educational value.  5 stars...really appeals to the 'build and destroy' most little boys love.  0 stars, and NOT the game's fault...the HUGE price fluctuation in the last 30 days...Now I see the price is above 1/2 of what I paid on Amazon less than a month ago...grrrr...I've seen it on Amazon, in the last 30 days from 16.99-35.00...so unless you have to have it...you may want to watch the price.  (I think I got hosed for 24.99)
B006JN5KBG|4.0|Fright Night is an awesome movie,but it's at a ridiculous price here on amazon.....$$$149.00!!!! on blu-ray...i'll never pay that much for any movie!!
B0052GACNM|1.0|The cd consisted of the correct packaging with a CD of an Irish singer instead to the Tony Bennett CD, I have heard the Tony Bennett duets and they are quite fine. I bought this as a gift and had to return it to amazon because of a fluke. The factory placed the wrong CD into the WRONG cover and even though it was factory sealed, the wrong music was on the wrong CD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|when you're really bored and need something to do this is where to go. I have lots of fun :)
037582913X|5.0|I think this is the 5th copy \\"I\\" have had, if you count the copies shared with brothers and cousins growing up. They were all loved to death. When I received this as a gift for my children, I was so pleased to see the binding is so much more durable than the other copies I have had. Let the squeals of delight and head shaking at Grover's silliness roll; we will be reading this one over and over for years.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I was very anxious to read this novel, but after I began reading, I found it extremely difficult to continue. The upper class characters were boring and superficial, and even the lower class characters made insufficient appearances and lacked enough depth to save this book. I felt as though it was a poor attempt at replicating the story line of the BBC series, &#34;Downtown Abbey.&#34; I never really felt as though I cared about the characters or what became of them. I am not sure if I will read the next in the series.
B0052GACNM|5.0|A great, great masterpiece by an aging master.  Enjoy Tony while you can.  The duets with the other greats enhance the quality of his performance.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Gift for a family member, wanted the whole set, but set price was to expensive, able to find separate movies thru Amazon  at a cheaper price
B001NEK2GE|4.0|hello I bought the logitech g13 gameboard a couple of months ago and at first i thought i was a little overwhelming with the amount keys you can program and i ended up not using it. however this is when i first started playing games on the computer and now that i better understand how to play computer games i found this very easy to use.  What i would say is that for first time computer gamers it would be probably better to get use to using the keyboard and etc.  anyways about the gameboard, it has 4 in game settings for one profiles and it can have multiple profiles. so you if you have the ability you could have up 10 different profiles and 4 different in game settings for each profile maybe more. The shape of the gameboard is very comfortable it has a padded palm rest which makes it usable for hours. The keys feel like durable plastic and dont feel like they they are going to break after i end up slamming keys and try harding to beat the other person. You can program each game profile to a different color of back lit keys which i very nice the back lit keys really make no difference because the all the keys say g1,g2,g3,etc. so its not really needed it still comes down to if you remember what keys you put where.  The lcd display can display news, music thats being played, clock and date, performance monitor, timer, and has the profile selector.  you can change the back lit keys to any color you want there are preprogramed colors but you can change the color to anything with the custom color selector.   i would give this a 4 out of 5 because of the quality of the construction it is a little difficult to figure out the first couple of times but once you understand the profile selector its probably the easiest thing to use. like i said before tho i wouldn't recommend to someone who is just starting to play computer games they should learn more hotkeys ect. before buy this but if you are looking for a good customize able keyboard to play with this is by far one of thebest with how many keys you can set.
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|I feel the app lacks polish,  and $.99 per retro title is too steep IMO.  Clean up the interface and think about bundling titles and I'd say it has a decent chance of success.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Not very good at all. There are lots of games shown but few free and they suck. I played pong, but it did not play well. I am not suprised that it was free.
B0052U59F4|3.0|I read this one in one day and the sequel to it the next. It's that amazing. I just could not put it down. Christian Grey is downright yummy. For those who are not used to his ways, it takes some getting used to but after a while, the details of his life sort of makes up for it. There is beautiful character development seriously going on within the confines of this book and the author did a fine job of writing this story. I highly suggest buying, downloading, and reading this. You will not regret it.  Although, I need to warn those who are a grammar nazi--there are a lot of typos, grammar mistakes, subject/verb issues. For a professionally edited story, this one lacked proof reading and corrections.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|After watching this I was stunned at the magnitude of greed depicted in this film. Very informative and enraging, seeing the architects of the catastrophe awarded government positions and pardons is inexcusable. The people in this film should be in jail or executed for destroying this country. Great film, sad subject.
B0055SWM08|5.0|lots of fun and thinking. always trying to better the score until you can't do better.  highly recommend this to anyone
B002ZG981E|5.0|As a fan of Nolan's films, I had high expectations for it and it does not disappoint. The movie is well made, well scripted, and the characters are perfect for the parts. Th ending is an all-time classic. The quality of the blu ray is excellent. I did not watch the DVD version.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great I like the winning play deal and all the options. solitaire is my favorite game. I like it specially cuz it was free
B003Y5H574|4.0|If you don't mind the use of cutesy coincidences to drive a plot, this entertaining film just might charm your socks off. True to its title, this movie examines the various crazy, stupid, and downright inexplicable aspects of love--and the love in this film flows freely: love lost between an endearing shlub (Steve Carrell) and his wife of 25 years (the always amazing Julianne Moore); love-as-lust as practiced by a hot young lothario (Ryan Gosling, perfectly cast); love avoided by an idealistic young lawyer-to-be (Emma Stone, in another role as the thinking man's hot chick); and unrequited love as only teenagers can experience it (Carrell's 13 year-old son, who just knows that his 17 year-old babysitter is his \\"soulmate\\" and said babysitter, who has a mad crush on Carrell). The plot here isn't the point anyway--except for one pitch-perfect scene in which Gosling and Stone lie in bed together and experience the true intimacy of really getting to know--and \\"click\\" with--another person. The plot twists might be a bit contrived, but this film has its heart in the right place. If this film doesn't make you smile, then you've probably never felt your pulse quicken or experienced butterflies in your stomach when you lay eyes on the object of your affection.
